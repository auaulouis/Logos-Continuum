Lobby Group Wants to Keep AI Unregulated,"

[The Information Technology Industry Council]{.underline} (ITI)---a
Washington D.C.-based lobby group that boasts Google, Amazon, and
Microsoft among its many clients---[is telling governments to think
twice about establishing laws to regulate AI]{.underline}. [But given
mounting safety, ethical, and social justice concerns, is that such a
good idea?]{.underline} On Tuesday, ITI released its "AI Policy
Principles," in which the lobby group outlined "specific areas where
industry, governments, and others can collaborate, as well as specific
opportunities for public-private partnership." In the new document, [ITI
acknowledged the need for the tech sector to promote the responsible
development and use of AI]{.underline}, while calling upon governments
to support, incentivize, and fund AI research efforts. [But as for
letting governments take a peek at an ITI client's source code, or enact
laws to steer the safe and ethical development of AI, that's something
it's a bit less enthused about]{.underline}. "[We also encourage
governments to evaluate existing policy tools and use caution before
adopting new laws, regulations, or taxes that may inadvertently or
unnecessarily impede the responsible development and use of
AI]{.underline}," notes ITI in its new list of AI principles. "This
extends to the foundational nature of protecting source code,
proprietary algorithms, and other intellectual property. [Failure to do
so could present a significant cyber risk]{.underline}." According to
its mandate, ITI seeks to "encourage all governments around the
world---including the US government---to develop policies, standards,
and regulations that promote innovation and growth for the tech
industry." It represents some of the heaviest hitters in the tech
sector, including Amazon, Facebook, Google, IBM, and Microsoft, while
claiming to be "the global voice of the tech sector" and "a catalyst for
preparing an AI world." [ITI's document is timely given just how
important AI is starting to become]{.underline}, both in terms of its
burgeoning influence on our lives (whether it be a photo-sorting app or
an algorithm that invents new medicines), and in the global economy (ITI
estimates that AI will add at least \$7 trillion to the global economy
by 2025). But it's also timely given the recent calls for oversight and
regulation. As **[Bloomberg]{.underline}** reporters Gerrit De Vynck and
Ben Brody write: [Big tech companies, and their software, are coming
under more scrutiny in the wake of news that Russian-sponsored accounts
used social networks to spread discord]{.underline} and try to influence
the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Algorithms designed
by Facebook, Twitter Inc. and Google have also been criticized for
increasing political polarization by giving people the type of news they
already agree with, creating so-called "filter bubbles." [And the
concerns don't stop there]{.underline}. [Developers are starting to be
criticized for allowing their AI systems to adopt human biases and
prejudices]{.underline} (a recent Princeton study, for example, showed
that some AI systems are sexist and racist). There's also uncertainty
about how AI will contribute to technological unemployment, automated
warfare, and computer hacking. [And there's still no consensus on the
specific ethical or moral codes that need to be imbued into these
systems]{.underline}. [There's also the frightening
potential]{.underline}, as thinkers like Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking, and
others have pointed out, [for something to go horribly wrong with
AI]{.underline}. As the recent AI breakthrough by Google-owned DeepMind
demonstrated, a fast takeoff event, in which [AI evolves into a
superintelligent form, may happen relatively quickly and without
warning, thus **introducing catastrophic---and possibly
existential---threats**]{.underline}. As all of this is happening, [it
shouldn't come as a surprise that some concerned observers are calling
for the government to step in]{.underline}. Musk has warned that
governments need to implement regulations "before it's too late," and
that it's only after things get out of hand that we tend to act. Two
years ago, the White House implemented a preliminary AI strategy, saying
AI needs to be ethical, that it must augment, and not replace, humans,
and that everyone should have a chance to participate in the development
of these systems. But as for formal regulations, [the White House said
it's still premature]{.underline}. As former US president Obama told
**[Wired]{.underline}** last year, "Most people aren't spending a lot of
time right now worrying about the Singularity---they are worrying about
'Well, is my job going to be replaced by a machine?'" Patrick Lin,
director of the Ethics + Emerging Sciences Group at California
Polytechnic State University, says that regulating new technologies is
always a delicate balancing act. "If you set regulation too early, then
you may be betting on the wrong standards, and that would be terrible
for commercialization, which is important," Lin told Gizmodo. "The same
problem exists with setting too many or unnecessary regulations; they
can create barriers to innovation. But commercialization isn't the only
value at stake here; public safety is another value in the equation. So,
[if there's little or no regulation for technologies that can have
serious impact on our lives]{.underline}---from self-driving cars to AI
systems that make criminal sentencing and bank lending decisions---then
that will be bad for society. It's a mistake to have a knee-jerk
reaction either way, reflexively for or against regulation. Each
technology is different and needs to be considered carefully on its own
merits." Lin says this conversation is currently happening in regards to
autonomous vehicles, with one camp arguing that regulatory standards
will put manufacturers on the same page about safety-critical functions
(which would protect the industry from some liability), with the other
camp saying we don't know enough to start forging standards. "[A middle
path between no regulation and state regulation is to let industry
regulate itself, which is the ITI approach]{.underline}," says Lin. "But
[this is far from ideal as well: it's letting the fox guard the
henhouse]{.underline}. [There's no teeth to enforce
self-regulations]{.underline} if a company breaks rank; there may be
even less transparency than with government regulators; and many other
problems." Currently, [the US has no federal agency dedicated to
regulating or monitoring AI, and it'll probably be a while before we see
anything like that]{.underline} (if ever). In the meantime, it'll be up
to various groups, both inside and outside the government, to monitor
developments in AI, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (to oversee development of autonomous vehicles) and the
Department of Homeland Security (to monitor cybersecurity threats). Some
private individuals and companies have created their own groups, such as
Musk's OpenAI initiative and Google's DeepMind Ethics & Society group.
But as Lin points out, there's a "having your cake and eat it, too"
aspect to self-regulation. "[On one hand, industry]{.underline}
(correctly[) says that AI is going to be this game-changing,
super-revolutionary thing, but on the other hand, they often tell us not
to worry about it]{.underline}, that they have it handled," he said.
"Worse, because t[he AI industry is so fragmented and full of
start-ups]{.underline}---or even individuals without formal education or
professional training, working from their basements---[you couldn't
possibly get them all on board with your self-imposed
regulations]{.underline}, whereas government regulations can use the
full force of law to achieve compliance." Lin says that self-regulation
may be better than no regulation or uninformed regulation, especially
when it's about a technology that could cause major problems for
society. As examples, he points to fake news, dieselgate, biased
decision systems, and so on. Sara Wachter-Boettcher, author of
Technically Wrong: Sexist Apps, Biased Algorithms, and Other Threats of
Toxic Tech, says she's happy to see an acknowledgement of the problem
and development of shared principles, but the underlying message to her
seems to be, "trust us, we're working on it." "I would ask, what
evidence do we have that they've got a handle on removing bias from AI?
Why should we trust tech companies when we see examples of them
embedding bias into software, or launching products with unintended
consequences, every day?," Wachter-Boettcher told Gizmodo. "I understand
that it's not as simple as lifting the curtain and letting the public
look at the code, but there needs to be agreed-upon and enforced levels
of transparency and accountability. While industry says it's afraid of
slowing down innovation, I think the rest of us should be a lot more
worried about the real risk of flying headfirst into even more
inequality, bias, and unintended harm." In an email to Gizmodo, Jaan
Tallinn, the co-founder of Skype, said "we need regulation eventually,
but first we need more research into what a positive and effective
regulation should look like." And indeed, [those arguing for regulations
are having some difficulty articulating what actually needs
regulating]{.underline}, and how it should be implemented and enforced.
Thankfully, however, these conversations have started and the frameworks
for AI regulation are starting to emerge. As Tallinn noted, [we're going
to need regulations eventually]{.underline}. The self-serving principles
set out by ITI can be seen as pre-emptive attack to delay the
inevitable, and to protect its clients from what it sees as meddlesome
and potentially costly intrusions. And self-serving it is; it can hardly
be said, for example---and as stated in the new list of
principles---that the ITI clientele could use some additional financial
support from the government. As Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom wrote
last year, "Great resources are devoted to making \[progress in AI\]
happen, with major (and growing) investments from both industry and
academia in many countries." At the same time, investments "in long-term
AI safety\...remains orders of magnitude less than investment in
increasing AI capabilities." That ITI did not list the funding of AI
safety initiatives by industry, government, and private sources as an
"AI principle" is as problematic as it is revealing. Moreover, it's not
immediately obvious that profit-driven companies with cranky
shareholders in the background are in any way interested in constraints
imposed by outside forces, or in voluntarily contributing to the public
good. Regulations and government oversight exists in the absence of
pro-social forces within the overarching capitalist framework. "We can
hope that corporate self-interest will align with public interests, but
that is a giant leap of faith, and many companies in ITIC don't exactly
have a great track record at winning public trust," Lin told Gizmodo.
"It's important to remember that they're not in the business of
protecting the public or promoting democracy---their business is
business. [When profit motives and humanitarian motives collide, take a
wild guess which one usually wins]{.underline}."

AI policy in China [Beijing's AI policy priorities are
clear]{.underline}. The "[Next Generation Artificial Intelligence
Development Plan]{.underline}," announced by China's State Council in
July 2017, [called for China to catch up on AI technology and
applications]{.underline} by 2020, [and]{.underline} to [become a global
AI innovation hub by 2030]{.underline}. Chinese President
[Xi]{.underline} Jinping hammered the point home in his 19th Party
Congress speech in October, when he [mentioned the development of
advanced manufacturing and the promotion of further integration of the
Internet, big data and artificial intelligence with the real-world
economy]{.underline}. Beijing has placed huge bets on AI for a host of
political and economic reasons, from improving governance capacity to
improving policy development and surveillance. [The plan calls for China
to lead the way in developing a regulatory environment to both encourage
AI development and to mitigate the potential downsides of
AI]{.underline}. A few months after the national plan's announcement in
July, the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) designated Baidu to
lead the autonomous vehicle platform, Tencent for medical, Alibaba for
Smart Cities, and iFlyTek for speech interfaces. These plans should be
taken seriously, as [the Chinese government has shown a strong track
record in delivering results]{.underline}. For example, Beijing
announced in 2010 that China would become the world's leader in adopting
high-speed rail (HSR). Today it has 60% of the world's HSR market. In
2014, the Chinese government announced the "Mass Entrepreneurship and
Innovation Plan."Today there are business 8000 incubators in China,
compared to 1400 in 2014. T[hese plans have teeth, both due to the
deadlines and metrics set out at the national level, as well as the
local companies that are likely to take these directions as top
priorities]{.underline}. [We can expect a similar trajectory for China's
AI policies]{.underline}. [Historically, the Chinese government has been
open-minded towards technology development]{.underline}. When a new
technology comes out, [the government will give it the benefit of doubt
and let it grow, rather than stifle it with policy or endless
debates]{.underline}. Also, [the environment in China is more conducive
to fast launch and iteration]{.underline}. There is a general belief
that it is better to launch something and then get it approved later.
[This allows Chinese businesses to generate real data at scale, which in
turn allows technology to improve over a shorter period of time,
particularly once AI is introduced into the equation]{.underline}. For
example, while in the US, truckers' unions are petitioning the
Department of Transportation to delay autonomous truck testing, in
China, the Xiong'an New Area, a planned smart city development southwest
of Beijing, is being designed from the ground up with full autonomy in
mind. Various highway authorities are willing to develop road
augmentation, special lanes, or move warehouses near highway exits, all
to facilitate faster deployment of autonomous trucks. We also see major
initiatives in cities, following the central government's call to
action. Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Tianjin are but a few of the
cities coming out with their own AI initiatives. [As with past policies,
much of the resources will be applied at the provincial and city
government levels]{.underline}. The types of resources may include
subsidies for top talent (especially overseas talent); guidance for top
VC funds, with the government playing the role of limited partner (LP)
but offering some of its upside to the general partners (GPs) of the
funds; special programs for top AI companies and start-ups (free rent,
subsidy for local hiring, housing and private school for top talents);
and technical awards for companies and individuals. Finally, [the US,
EU, and China will also compete to be out in front on developing a
regulatory regime around AI technologies and applications]{.underline}.
The National Plan's explicit recognition of the need for regulatory,
legal, and ethical principles for AI development and use represents an
uncommonly foresighted approach. Of course, [the government's approach
to AI regulation, ethics, and economic adjustment will reflect Beijing's
broader model of governance and ideology]{.underline}. [Given its
preference for a state-centric approach to international
issues]{.underline}, for example, [it is possible China will launch an
initiative via the UN to establish first an automation/AI-related "code
of conduct,]{.underline}" or basic regulatory approach, followed by a
special committee on the topic and eventually an oversight body
operating within a UN framework. [Such an initiative would put China at
the forefront of developing a global approach to these
issues]{.underline}. Beijing has attempted a similar approach on
cybersecurity issues, which it argues have a global impact and require a
global regulatory response.

[Science and technology will become the lifeblood of the Chinese
economy]{.underline} in this decade and will remain its lifeblood in the
future. [That is]{.underline}, in part, [because China has become
sufficiently advanced to be able to effectively compete with the US and
other technological leaders in the West]{.underline}. [It is also the
key to China's ability to innovate]{.underline} and compete in the
future, as it is for other advanced economies. Innovation-driven growth
is also required in order for Beijing to smoothly deleverage away from
its manufacturing base model of growth, which is slowly running out of
steam. In the decade that has just passed, its productivity gains
faltered and credit-driven investment in low return capital propped up
its growth. [China must address its slowing productivity gains to
produce a smooth rebalancing of the economy]{.underline}. Productivity
growth will not come from textiles, steel or the property market, and
the flourishing services sector will require cutting-edge technology to
remain competitive. To pull it off, [China will need to acquire and
deploy advanced technology quickly and efficiently throughout its
economy]{.underline}. [China is diligently preparing to assume a
seemingly preordained role as the world leader in a plethora of areas.
It is driven. It is focused. And it will stop at nothing to ensure that
it has all the advantages it can glean from the existing world order to
create a world order in its own image]{.underline}. [Technology is
absolutely critical to achieving that objective]{.underline}, and there
is little that is more important in that regard than cutting-edge
telecommunications --- specifically 5G technology. [The Huawei saga has
served to illustrate this point]{.underline}. America's issues with
Huawei are as much about who has access to, and thus controls, the data
of the future, as they are about superpower politics and the rule of
law. Some Western intelligence sources believe the company is
state-owned and has deep connections to China's intelligence services.
Its founder was an engineer with the People's Liberation Army (PLA), and
it is worth adding that no large Chinese company is fully independent of
the government. Although [China spends more than \$200 billion on
research]{.underline} (second only to the US), generates close to 30,000
PhDs in science and engineering, [and leads the world in patent
applications each year]{.underline}, its record is mixed in terms of the
actual impact of innovation, as measured by the success of companies in
commercializing new ideas and competing in the global market. [China has
some unique strengths in innovation, which includes the rapid
commercialization of new ideas by virtue of the size of its consumer
base]{.underline}. It also [has the world's most extensive manufacturing
ecosystem]{.underline}, enabling continuous innovation in production
processes that reduce costs and improve quality, and has created
capacity for research with a growing number of universities and research
institutions, as well as an expanding pool of talent. On the minus side
of the ledger, China's slow regulatory processes and weak intellectual
property protections prevent foreign investors from wanting to bring
their best and brightest researchers and innovations to the country.
[Completing the journey from innovation sponge]{.underline} (absorbing
and adapting existing technology and knowledge from around the world)
[to global innovation leader is not just a way to signal China's
progress as an economy and society]{.underline}. [The boost to
productivity that innovation provides is critically important for
sustaining China's growth]{.underline}. [Beijing has enacted some two
dozen laws that have created a technology-siphoning
machine]{.underline}. That apparatus maintains databases of foreign
co-optees and distributes stipends, sinecures and cash to foreign donors
of high-tech innovations. [China has targeted all sources of American
innovation, including universities, corporations and government labs,
exploiting both their openness and naivete, with methods and tradecraft
custom-tailored to each target]{.underline}. The Chinese government's
current system for processing and reverse engineering stolen designs has
grown significantly larger than it was during the Cold War and has
developed from a strictly military operation into a system permeating
the entire Chinese government. It is an elaborate, comprehensive system
for identifying foreign technologies, acquiring them by every means
imaginable and converting them into weapons and competitive goods. China
could not have experienced the dramatic economic transformation it has
experienced in the 21st century, nor have sustained its progress as it
has, without inexpensive and unrestricted access to other countries'
technology. [Chinese firms have routinely become investors in American
startups]{.underline}, particularly those working on cutting-edge
technologies with potential military applications. These are companies
that make rocket engines for spacecraft, sensors for autonomous navy
ships and printers that make flexible screens that can be used in
fighter-plane cockpits. Many of the Chinese firms are owned by
state-owned companies or have direct connections to Chinese leaders.
According to the US Department of Defense, [Beijing actively encourages
Chinese companies with close government ties to invest in American
startups specializing in critical technologies such as artificial
intelligence]{.underline} (AI) and robots to advance China's military
capacity, as well as its economy. [US government controls intended to
protect potentially critical technologies against countries like China
have fallen short]{.underline}. It took a while, but such transactions
eventually started ringing alarm bells in Washington. US lawmakers
raised broad questions about the nature of China's economic relationship
with the US well before the Trump administration started applying
tariffs on Chinese products, in an effort to reduce the inherent
inequity in bilateral trade between the two nations. [China is extremely
capable and driven]{.underline}. [When it aims to be a leader in a
particular sector or acquire a certain technology, it does so with
precision]{.underline}. [There is no question that Beijing aims to be a
leader in AI, semiconductors and any number of other sub-sectors of the
technology-driven 21st-century economy]{.underline}. [It has the
advantage of having a lot of money to spend and plenty of people and
resources to devote to the issue]{.underline}. Since it certainly
appears that [the US government will not be devoting similar
resources]{.underline} to the tech sector any time soon, [it is merely a
question of time until China captures that title]{.underline}, too. In
the battle for the future, the Chinese Communist Party understands very
well what is at stake. [It took the US and West too long to realize what
China was doing]{.underline}, and by the time they did, Beijing was
already approaching strongly from behind. [Soon enough, the West will be
looking at China in the tech space from the front window, rather than
the rearview mirror]{.underline}.

#### Revitalization of American hegemony forces takeover of the sector.

To "rethink the policies of the last two decades," [[military coercion
and engagement]{.mark} strategies, previously enacted by the United
States, [have been largely unsuccessful in deterring
China]{.mark}]{.underline}['s]{.mark} revisionist activities and
ambition to achieve great power status in the Pacific
theater.^[2]{.underline}^ [The Biden administration's interim national
security strategy guidance]{.underline}, published in March of 2021,
[demonstrates a small step toward [reinvigorating US liberal hegemony
via multilateralism]{.mark} to combat Chinese aggression and "ensure
America, not China, sets the international
agenda]{.underline}."^[3]{.underline}^ [The current US strategy places
an emphasis on]{.underline} strengthening ties with Allied and partner
nations to unite the world's democracies for collective security,
[[reinvesting in innovation to maintain US technological
advantages]{.underline}]{.mark}, and defending democratic values at home
and abroad to promote open and free societies to advance American
interests. To go a step further, [the United States must ground its
overall approach to the People's Republic of China (PRC) with a strategy
of liberal hegemony that maintains America's status as "the world's lone
superpower" and counters Beijing's rise in the international system by
leveraging "smart power" tools]{.underline}---developing high-tech
military concepts to dominate the information sphere and enhancing soft
power efforts to competitively attract the international community to
the US' liberal values.^[4]{.underline}^ This is an effective approach
for two reasons: first, "power is becoming less transferable, less
coercive, and less tangible;" and second, [[Beijing's ability to
successfully challenge US]{.mark} liberal [heg]{.mark}emony [lies
in]{.mark} its employment of [asymmetric tools]{.mark}]{.underline}, not
in order of battle.^[5]{.underline}^ "While President Xi Jinping has
proclaimed "China will never seek hegemony or engage in expansion," PRC
actions display deliberate attempts to "displace the United States in
the Indo-Pacific region" and challenge US liberal hegemony across the
international system.^[6]{.underline}^ [This US "smart power" approach
to China focuses on reducing legacy force structure, prioritizing a
smaller, more capable force, and strengthening attractiveness of US
liberal hegemony]{.underline} to combat the multi-dimensional challenges
posed by a revisionist China. Power is the ability to get others to want
what you want by changing the behavior of states to support your desired
outcome.^[7]{.underline}^ In the past, the character of power correlated
closely with capital, which funded the use of military force to coerce
adversarial actors. The United States came to its current position on
the back of this form of power. It has long sought military and economic
preeminence to prevent the emergence of "challenger" states in the
international arena.^[8]{.underline}^ The invasion of Iraq and overthrow
of Saddam Hussein showcased US strategy to employ military power to
defeat a perceived threat to US objectives and influence in the Middle
East. Currently, the US continues to flex its economic prowess by
imposing several sanctions on Russia as a response to the annexation of
Crimea and multiple cyberattacks on US infrastructure to cripple its
economic and military capacity but has made little progress in altering
the Kremlin's aggressive behavior. As illustrated in the Russian
example, this old view of power---an overwhelming emphasis on hard power
to advance US interests and preserve liberal hegemony---will fail in the
long run against the multi-dimensional world of today wherein "power is
passing from the 'capital-rich' to the 'information-rich.'"[^9^ [It is
no longer enough to have a large military force]{.mark} or a deep
pocketbook. One must be able to obtain and analyze the correct
information quickly to enable rapid decision-making and generate effects
that the adversary is unable to effectively respond to]{.underline}. A
timely response to new information before one's opponent can act gives
one the strategic advantage, necessary to achieving a favorable balance
of power. The ability to take action on US terms and force our
adversaries to respond. **[[Advances in technology have led to enhanced
digitization]{.mark}, [increasing the importance of organizational
skills and flexibility]{.mark} over material
capabilities]{.underline}**.^[10]{.underline}^ Information-rich power
has altered the landscape of geopolitics in another way by elevating the
importance of strategic narratives. "Great powers use strategic
narratives to establish and maintain influence in the international
system and to shape the system itself."^[11]{.underline}^ In other
words, "success is the result not merely of whose army wins, but also
whose story wins."^[12]{.underline}^ Vladimir Putin's strategic
narrative concerning the crisis in Ukraine in 2014 was able to weaken
the US credibility and US-NATO collective efforts to effectively deter
Russia's annexation of Crimea. With the help of its state-owned media
outlets, social media, and spending on international broadcasting,
Russia claimed that most of the Crimean population desired reunification
with Russia, appealed to USSR nostalgia by insisting that the former
Soviet republics were one country with Russian ethnic groups being
wrongly split across borders, and framed the US as a bully by
emphasizing US unilateral action in Iraq and Afghanistan and condemning
US attempts to assert its dominance over Europe and
Russia.^[13]{.underline}^ Moscow's employment of identity, historical,
and international narratives to justify Russian behavior in Crimea
challenged US authority in the international community and undermined US
sanction efforts as some NATO countries stood firmly opposed to
supporting EU sanctions against Russia. Despite its military and
economic prowess, the US was unable to deter Crimea's annexation and
failed to credibly influence Russia behavior. [[China has taken
advantage of this]{.mark} shift in the character of power]{.underline}.
Since 2000[, China has become the second largest economy in the
world]{.underline}, militarized islands in the South China Sea of which
it has no rightful claim,^[14]{.underline}^ and committed numerous cyber
intrusion and theft operations against US information networks. Beijing
continues aggressive and manipulative activities against its neighbors
in the Indo-Pacific region that support Washington's leadership position
in the intelligence community (IC)---a conscious attempt to oppose US
hegemony in pursuit of the "Chinese Dream."^[15]{.underline}^
Furthermore, [China has embraced information warfare and soft power to
directly counter the United States]{.underline}---a militarily stronger
foe.^[16]{.underline}^ Rather than matching US comprehensive power, the
PRC has chosen to conduct asymmetric warfare to target key US
vulnerabilities, counter overall American strengths, and gradually chip
away at US hegemony.[17 Previous US strategies have yet to adequately
address this shift in the character of power]{.underline}. The US is
still focused on capital-rich power employment. A classic example of
this is Washington's intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq. America's
involvement in the Middle East to quell terrorist organizations are
attempts at employing traditional power coercion through brute force.
While this strategy worked in the Gulf War, the US hasn't seen much, if
any, success in employing this strategy since. Currently, US forces have
been ordered to withdraw from Afghanistan after a decades-long war that
has seen very little progress in employing military power to solve the
complex problems of the Middle East nation, sacrificing numerous US
lives in the process. [Due to its inability to pivot to information-rich
power employment, [the US has thus far been unable to counter Chinese
aggression]{.mark}]{.underline} in the information sphere and counter
its efforts to influence states to legitimize Chinese leadership. The
United States "crime-and-punishment" approach during the Six Party
Talks---specifically, its unwillingness to hold direct talks with North
Korea (DPRK), demands for unilateral concessions, and "unilateral
display of muscle" by threatening military force and imposing economic
sanctions on the "rogue" state---ultimately failed to compel a permanent
halt in DPRK nuclear weapon ambitions.^[18]{.underline}^ China's role as
host and mediator of the Six Party Talks provided it an opportunity to
exploit participants' concerns over the United States' aggressive
strategy toward DPRK. The PRC---pledging its commitment to a
multilateral approach to reach a peaceful resolution---rallied
participants behind less stringent actions ultimately thwarting
Washington's approach to dismantle DPRK's nuclear
program.^[19]{.underline}^ As a result, the PRC was able to construct a
'good guy' persona to improve foreign perceptions of China, demonstrate
its capability to shape global affairs, and reshape the international
order to one that is responsive to China's interests.^[20]{.underline}^
On the other hand, an engagement strategy to encourage and maintain
dialogue with the PRC while attempting to avoid direct confrontation
with China has increased uncertainty regarding US commitment to its
Allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region. US failure to preempt or
adequately respond to Chinese aggressive or irresponsible behavior has
hindered US influence and capability in the Pacific region and
worldwide. This strategy continues to allow China to exert influence
over US foreign policy, weaken US credibility in the region, and freely
propagate its brand of Communism globally, undermining US liberal
hegemony without incurring costs. This is demonstrated by continued
Chinese military aggression in the South China Sea wherein smaller
countries, at times, acquiesce to Chinese demands or fail to denounce
Chinese actions due to their uncertainty regarding US commitment in the
region. This sows doubt across the international community regarding
America's credibility and strength to act freely and secure its
interests in the region with states questioning continued alignment to
the US, threatening US access and influence in the Indo-Pacific theater.
Put simply, the United States is in danger of losing the information and
soft power war against the PRC and with it, its superpower status. China
has successfully conducted numerous cyberespionage operations, stealing
information to build advanced technology and military equipment to
counter US information and military advantage. Moreover, **[the [US is
failing to rapidly transition emerging technologies into the armed
forces]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and has fallen short in discovering novel
ways in which these technologies can be used for enhanced military
advantage over an adversary]{.underline}. In 2020, **[Secretary of
Defense Mark Esper stressed [the inability of the]{.mark} Department of
Defense ([DOD]{.mark}) [to]{.mark} appropriately and rapidly acquire and
[scale innovative technology for military
employment]{.mark}]{.underline}**.^[21]{.underline}^ [Beijing has
initiated a number of efforts to continue to move China closer toward
attaining a global leadership position in the IC]{.underline}. [China's
"intelligent" approach to warfare]{.underline}---the militarization of
enabling technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence
(AI), quantum information, big data analytics, and unmanned
systems---[demonstrate its efforts to prepare for the demands of future
combat operations]{.underline} requiring "rapid processing and the
fusing of information to support quick and efficient command
decision-making."^[22]{.underline}^ In 2016, China launched the first
space-based quantum satellite, Micius, demonstrating considerable
progress in in its goal to develop unhackable global communications
through entanglement-based quantum key distribution.^[23]{.underline}^
Additionally, its "Three Warfare" strategy---nonkinetic measures to
manipulate the behavior of states in favor of Chinese Communist Party
(CCP) preferred outcomes---serves to maintain CCP legitimacy, extend
Beijing's reach, and insert China's brand of socialism across the
IC.^[24]{.underline}^ China's use of information at the political level
buoy these advances in information's operational employment. Most
recently, the PRC has taken advantage of the US State Department's
delayed response to the coronavirus pandemic, its emphasis in placing
the blame on China and the Chinese people for the creation and spread of
COVID-19, and its failure to rapidly allocate COVID-19 resources,
including providing vaccines beyond US borders. Notably, [Beijing was
able to quickly portray itself as a "well-organized state capable of
controlling the full situation]{.underline}," rapidly distribute
conspiracy theories that accused the US of spreading COVID-19, pose as
the defender against an American bully, and provide vaccines to
countries in need before the US---all soft power tools shaping global
perceptions in favor of Chinese leadership and direction concerning the
pandemic.^[25]{.underline}^ [Every action China takes to pursue its
interests weakens the legitimacy and attractiveness of US hegemonic
leadership]{.underline}, which results in a loss in relative power. A
2020 Pew Research Center survey of 14 advanced economies, three located
in the Indo-Pacific region, [most people believed China handled the
coronavirus better than the US]{.underline} and overall had unfavorable
views of both the US and China.^[26]{.underline}^ While limited in
scope, [this poll provides a glimpse of reduced attractiveness to US
liberal hegemony largely influenced by its soft power
deficiencies]{.underline}. For weak Indo-Pacific states that regularly
employ hedging strategies to prevent either the US or China from
dominating the region, the decreased attractiveness of a US partner may
spell disaster.^[27]{.underline}^ The US can reverse this potential
disaster through a strategy that combines power with ideas---strength
with liberal values. [The United States must maximize its power relative
to that of China to preserve American dominance in the international
community]{.underline}, while reinvesting in the propagation of its
liberal values^[28]{.underline}^ **[These [smart power objectives
emphasize the militarization of emerging technologies to deny CCP
advantages]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the information domain and
**[[require the US to take the lead]{.mark} in strengthening the
legitimacy and attraction to US liberal hegemony]{.underline}**. To gain
a clear military advantage over China, **[the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [needs to continue to heavily invest in]{.mark} the
research and development of [emerging]{.mark} information-age
[tech]{.mark}nologies---AI, autonomy, robotics, quantum, big data, and
machine learning---[and its rapid integration]{.mark} into all aspects
of US military infrastructure to increase the effectiveness of the
information collected and how it is used]{.underline}**. Specifically,
the United States needs to allocate a larger portion of defense spending
to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, increase defense
partnerships with Silicon Valley industries and research universities,
and improve acquisition practices to facilitate and accelerate military
applications of intelligent technologies. [The US must invest in and
further develop technologies that will enable persistent awareness of
adversary actions, speed up effective decision-making, and increase
lethality at a low cost and low risk to the US. [Specifically]{.mark},
investing in [quantum, AI, autonomy, and cyber
technologies]{.mark}]{.underline} for offensive and defensive purposes
requires further integration and cooperation between the Department of
Defense and the scientific community. Increased integration and
cooperation between scientific and technical entities and the DOD will
assist and maintain US technical and military advantages. Information is
power. [These high-tech systems are a cost-effective avenue to overcome
the limits of human intelligence and allow the United States to rapidly
understand the environment and make decisions faster than the
adversary]{.underline}. Moreover, a high-tech--enabled force supports
rapid collection and analysis of large amounts of data, enables swift
decision-making, and enhances the lethality of US military
forces.^[29]{.underline}^ Whereas now the US can neither effectively
stop nor respond to China stealing US intellectual property via cyber
channels, technology such as AI-enabled cybersecurity can be used to
rapidly detect China encroachment into US systems and automatically deny
its ability to steal US scientific and military data. In an environment
characterized by information power, operational agility against an
adversary must be met with agility at the political level. The US
Department of State (DOS)---responsible for advancing American interests
through diplomacy, advocacy, and assistance efforts---has fallen short
in the narrative battle against its adversaries leading to an overall
decline in US appeal and influence worldwide. To increase the
attractiveness of US liberal hegemony, the United States needs to
influence states to champion American interests and combat adversaries'
anti-US information campaign. To achieve this, the United States must
craft a strategic narrative in which 'a strong America means freedom,
prosperity, and security for all,' consistently reinforcing the story
that only through US liberal hegemony can the international community
achieve a peaceful end state. Knowing this, the United States must
increase its emphasis on alternative instruments to comprehensively
maximize power and maintain its superpower status, or risk being
outpaced by its competitors. [The United States must reinstate the US
Information Agency to ensure that American soft power is "always on
display]{.underline}" wherein its stated culture and liberalist values
are clearly demonstrated in its policies and activities to attract
states to US interests and legitimize American liberal hegemony in the
world order.^[30]{.underline}^ "If the state's power seems legitimate,
it will encounter less resistance to its wishes. If its culture and
ideology are attractive, others will more willingly
follow."^[31]{.underline}^ Perceptions and popularity are equally
important to hard military power in influencing states' behavior.
Currently, the lack of such an agency and DOS shortfalls has resulted in
the muddling of US strategic narrative and a perceived loss of
credibility in American leadership---which gives China an in-road to vie
for IC support and tip the balance of power in its favor. The DOD can
help reclaim some of this credibility by investing more heavily in HA/DR
operations in East Asia. Furthermore, a strategy of US liberal hegemony
must not only work to counter Chinese advantages but credibly convince
Pacific states of America's benign character and of the detrimental
impact Chinese hegemony will have on the region. This will promote
hedging strategies that will, with greater probability, favor Washington
as opposed to Beijing leadership. HA/DR operations are a means to
amplify one's foreign policy goals by providing goodwill and leverage.
Research suggests that US aid increases support for Washington and its
liberal democratic values, such as free and fair
elections.^[32]{.underline}^ However, in the aftermath of the
Soviet-Afghan War, where the US failed to provide aid following the
Soviet's defeat by the Mujahideen, the Taliban and Al-Qaeda were able to
fill the void and fortify their power in the region---resulting in a
hostile nation diametrically opposed to US hegemony and its liberal
values. Today, the US has been in a war against terror in Afghanistan
for 22 years to combat these same threats wherein US sacrifices might
have been avoided with initial aid to improve relations in Afghanistan
and promote its liberal values. In a similar vein, Beijing recognizes
that development is an instrument of power, ^[33]{.underline}^ and is
increasing its activities in HA/DR to gain legitimacy for Chinese global
leadership. Moreover, if the United States does not consistently take a
leading role in world development, China will fill this gap to weaken
the credibility and influence of US liberal hegemony. Currently, delayed
response times, lack of a unified US message, and ineffective
coordination between USAID and the DOD has hindered US proficiency in
humanitarian aid and disaster relief (HA/DR) efforts, providing
adversaries an opportunity to enhance influence.^[34]{.underline}^ The
United States must take a commanding lead in humanitarian aid by
increasing funding and military assistance to, while also providing more
opportunities for interagency coordination with the US Agency of
International Aid (USAID). This will enhance rapid mobility and
sustainability of HA/DR efforts worldwide and adequately showcase the
benefits of powerful US leadership in the international system.
Assistance recipients are more likely to buy-in to the US brand of
leadership when they have directly benefited from it. It is in America's
best interest to prioritize HA/DR and provide increased support to USAID
to improve relations, gain access, and expand its influence across the
IC. Traditionally, power is measured by states' ability to coerce using
hard power; however, the diffusion of power largely due to increased
interdependence and advanced technology development has rendered these
traditional sources of power less effective in achieving desired
outcomes. Today, [[it is not enough to coerce states]{.mark} into
accepting US liberal hegemony]{.underline}. The United States must also
be able to credibly attract and legitimize American leadership to garner
deep commitment for US liberal hegemony across the IC. [America's
renewed focus on "[smart power]{.mark}]{.underline}"---using hard and
soft power in concert to increase the balance of power in its
favor---[[will reassert American dominance]{.mark} in the international
system and counter PRC efforts to revise the world
order.]{.underline}[35 A strong America is vital for a secure,
prosperous, and free world]{.underline}.

#### Regulatory capture kills US government control of the industry.

Simon **Constable** 03-26-**18** \[Contributor to Forbes; Forbes; "Why
we should not regulate the tech industry";
https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonconstable/2018/03/26/no-we-really-dont-need-government-regulation-of-the-tech-industry/?sh=29e545a4eb8d//ZW\]

[It\'s time to just say no to calls for more government regulation of
the tech industry]{.underline}. Such requests would be laughable if they
weren\'t so sad. The truth is that [the [government]{.mark} proved
beyond reasonable doubt its [inability to effectively regulate]{.mark}
during the financial crisis]{.underline}. In that light, calls for the
government to now impose and administer new rules on an equally complex
industry seem preposterous. The desires for more regulation came last
week from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg who was responding to
revelations in The Observer newspaper that data on perhaps more than 50
million of Facebook\'s users had been shared. Talking on CNN last week
Zuckerberg said: \"I actually am not sure we shouldn't be regulated,\"
which will no doubt be taken as we need the government to step in.
Indeed that seems to be what happened when another tech titan, Apple\'s
CEO Tim Cook, explicitly requested more government mandated rules. He
said: Expect such calls to grow into a chorus before long. But just
because we are likely to hear thunderous demands for Federal oversight
doesn\'t mean that new rules from the government make any sense. Here\'s
why: \[graphic omitted\] [Recent history [shows the incompetence of
government regulators]{.mark}]{.underline}. An alphabet soup of
government agencies failed to stop the financial crisis of 2007-2008
which resulted from making too many home loans to people with less than
perfect credit. [The organizations charged with regulation included the
Securities Exchange Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency, the state-level regulators, as well as the Federal
Reserve.]{.underline} The latter, it should be noted, wasn\'t sure that
there was a problem with dodgy mortgages even as late as 2007. Then
chairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke, said: We believe the effect of the
troubles in the subprime sector on the broader housing market will be
limited and we do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime
market to the rest of the economy or to the financial system. Given what
happened to the economy after that, Bernanke\'s statement may well go
down as the definition of incorrect. [It [doesn\'t seem reasonable to
expect the that the government would fare better with regulating
tech]{.mark}]{.underline} than it did in finance. [The [private sector
was way ahead of the government]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Rather than the
government spot the problem]{.underline}, it was the private sector that
highlighted the burgeoning issues of mortgages turning from good to bad.
Notably, investor John Paulson saw the cracks in the mortgage market
clearly and then took action that made him billions of dollars in
profits. He made sizable bets that the mortgage loans were indeed as
dodgy as he thought. That story is ably told by Michael Lewis in his
fabulous book, *The Big Short*. If you don\'t fancy reading it, then try
watching the movie. Either the book or the film will give you an
education in markets. In any event[, in the case of tech, without doubt,
[the private sector will be far ahead of the
bureaucrats]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Expert regulators get hired by the
regulated. [If the regulators themselves were any good at what they
do]{.mark}, then it is more than likely that [they\'d end up working for
one of the regulated companies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why? This happens
because [[the private sector]{.mark} can and does pay far more than does
the government for such expertis]{.underline}e. The hiring companies can
afford to pay fat salaries because the knowledge the former regulators
bring allows the companies to run circles around the rules. Investopedia
dubs the situation one of \"gamekeeper turned poacher.\" The only caveat
is that the poacher manages to give the gamekeeper the runaround while
remaining within the rules of the law. [In short, it [makes the
regulations impotent]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[It is [part of a problem
known as regulatory capture]{.mark}]{.underline}** [whereby the
[regulators listen far more to the companies]{.mark}/industry they are
supposed to oversee rather than anyone els]{.underline}e. For a more
detailed outline of the matter see Investopedia. [[Regulatory
capture,]{.mark} without doubt, can [occur in the tech business]{.mark}
just as much as it has elsewhere]{.underline}. [Regulations help the
largest companies the most]{.underline}. By no means least important, is
the fact that government rules help to entrench the dominant companies
more than they would be otherwise. Regulations, whether they be simple
form-filling or more extensive, are costly to administer by the
companies regulated. These costs tend to disproportionately fall on
smaller firms which don\'t have the economies of scale associated with
being a large corporation. When the so-called regulatory burden, or the
dollar costs of complying with the rules, get large then some smaller
companies will decide to throw in the towel and get out of the industry
in question. [Eventually, [if regulations continue their momentous march
forward]{.mark} from reams of paper to filing cabinets full, then [the
industry will solely be dominated by massive
companies]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, more regulation leads to
fewer but larger competitors. [When an industry has fewer competitors,
the result tends to be increased profits for the remaining
companies]{.underline}. This is true regardless of the industry.
Solutions? How should we solve the data breaches and the misuses of
personal information? It is an important question. In the first
instance, the U.S. does have a reasonably well-functioning court system.
Maybe the infractions will result in a lawsuit so that the maligned can
seek financial redress. If the data sharing wasn\'t significant enough
to warrant a court filing, then maybe we don\'t need the government to
step in to save the situation in the first place. Second, the market for
technology services, such as social media, is highly competitive. In
2005 Facebook was a bit player in the social media industry; then second
fiddle to MySpace as maestro. Now not so much as MySpace has shrunk in
importance. It seems evident that either Facebook will get its act
together quickly to redress the problems and gain back lost credibility
with users. Failing that a new company will offer a better service to
people.

Artificial intelligence can play chess, drive a car and diagnose medical
issues. Examples include Google DeepMind's AlphaGo, Tesla's self-driving
vehicles, and IBM's Watson. This type of artificial intelligence is
referred to as [Artificial Narrow Intelligence]{.underline} (ANI) --
non-human systems that can perform a specific task. We encounter this
type on a daily basis, and its [use is growing rapidly]{.underline}.
[But while many impressive capabilities have been
demonstrated]{.underline}, [we're also beginning to see
problems]{.underline}. The worst case involved a self-driving test car
that hit a pedestrian in March. The pedestrian died and the incident is
still under investigation. The next generation of AI [With the next
generation of AI the stakes will almost certainly be much
higher]{.underline}. Artificial General Intelligence ([AGI]{.underline})
[will have advanced computational powers and human level
intelligence]{.underline}. AGI systems will be able to learn, solve
problems, adapt and self-improve. They will even do tasks beyond those
they were designed for. Importantly, [their rate of improvement could be
exponential as they become far more advanced than their human
creators]{.underline}. [The introduction of AGI could quickly bring
about Artificial Super Intelligence]{.underline} (ASI). While fully
functioning AGI systems do not yet exist, it has been [estimated that
they will be with us]{.underline} anywhere between [2029]{.underline}
and the end of the century. What appears [almost certain is that they
will arrive eventually]{.underline}. When they do, [there is a great and
natural concern that we won't be able to control them]{.underline}. The
risks associated with AGI [There is no doubt that AGI systems could
transform humanity]{.underline}. Some of the more powerful applications
include curing disease, solving complex global challenges such as
climate change and food security, and initiating a worldwide technology
boom. But [a failure to implement appropriate controls could lead to
catastrophic consequences]{.underline}. Despite what we see in Hollywood
movies, [existential threats are not likely to involve killer
robots]{.underline}. [The problem will not be one of malevolence, but
rather one of intelligence, writes MIT professor]{.underline} Max
Tegmark in his 2017 book Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial
Intelligence. It is here that [the science of human-machine
systems]{.underline} -- known as Human Factors and Ergonomics -- will
come to the fore. [Risks will emerge from the fact that
super-intelligent systems will identify more efficient ways of doing
things, concoct their own strategies for achieving goals, and even
develop goals of their own]{.underline}. Imagine these examples: an [AGI
system tasked with preventing HIV decides to eradicate the problem by
killing everybody who carries the disease]{.underline}, or one tasked
with curing cancer decides to kill everybody who has any genetic
predisposition for it an [autonomous AGI military drone decides the only
way to guarantee an enemy target is destroyed is to wipe out an entire
community]{.underline} an [environmentally protective AGI decides the
only way to slow or reverse climate change is to remove technologies and
humans that induce it]{.underline}. These scenarios raise the spectre of
disparate AGI systems battling each other, none of which take human
concerns as their central mandate. [Various dystopian futures have been
advanced, including those in which humans eventually become
obsolete]{.underline}, **[with the subsequent extinction of the human
race]{.underline}**. Others have forwarded less extreme but still
significant disruption, including [malicious use of AGI for terrorist
and cyber-attacks]{.underline}, the removal of the need for human work,
and mass surveillance, to name only a few. So there is a need for
human-centred investigations into the safest ways to design and manage
AGI to minimise risks and maximise benefits. How to control AGI
Controlling AGI is not as straightforward as simply applying the same
kinds of controls that tend to keep humans in check. [Many controls on
human behaviour rely on our consciousness, our emotions, and the
application of our moral values]{.underline}. [AGIs won't need any of
these attributes to cause us harm]{.underline}. Current forms of control
are not enough. Arguably, there are three sets of controls that require
development and testing immediately: the controls required to ensure AGI
system designers and developers create safe AGI systems the controls
that need to be built into the AGIs themselves, such as "common sense",
morals, operating procedures, decision-rules, and so on the controls
that need to be added to the broader systems in which AGI will operate,
such as regulation, codes of practice, standard operating procedures,
monitoring systems, and infrastructure. Human Factors and Ergonomics
offers methods that can be used to identify, design and test such
controls well before AGI systems arrive. For example, it's possible to
model the controls that exist in a particular system, to model the
likely behaviour of AGI systems within this control structure, and
identify safety risks. This will allow us to identify where new controls
are required, design them, and then remodel to see if the risks are
removed as a result. In addition, our models of cognition and decision
making can be used to ensure AGIs behave appropriately and have
humanistic values. [Act now, not later]{.underline} This kind of
research is in progress, but there is not nearly enough of it and not
enough disciplines are involved. Even the high-profile tech entrepreneur
Elon Musk has [warned of the "existential crisis" humanity faces from
advanced AI]{.underline} and has [spoken about the need to regulate AI
before it's too late]{.underline}. [The next decade or so represents a
critical period]{.underline}. [There is an opportunity to create safe
and efficient AGI systems that can have far reaching benefits to society
and humanity]{.underline}. At the same time, a business-as-usual
approach in which [we play catch-up with rapid technological advances
could contribute to the extinction of the human race]{.underline}. The
ball is in our court, but it won't be for much longer.

### 1nc \-\-- Nato Expansion

#### Developing a united NATO front is the US' primary mechanism to check China rise

[NATO]{.underline} [touts]{.underline} [itself as a \"defensive\"
alliance]{.underline}, [but in reality, **it has been destabilizing**
the world]{.underline} [**for** **Washington\'s** pursuit of
**hegemony**]{.underline}. Established in response to the Soviet Union,
the bloc\'s mission was accomplished three decades ago and should have
shut down upon the end of the Cold War. However, desperately looking for
new missions, the bloc has enlarged five times since 1999, expanding its
members from 16 to 30. This raised the anxiety level of Russia and has
eventually led to the war in Ukraine.

[Shouting peace and security]{.underline}, [**the bloc** has **dropped**
a massive]{.underline} [amount of **bombs** **on** the soil of **other
countries**]{.underline}. [Under]{.underline} the [slogan of
\"preventing humanitarian disasters]{.underline},\" [NATO]{.underline}
[bombed]{.underline} [Yugoslavia]{.underline} [for 78 continuous
days]{.underline}, [killing and injuring more than 8,000
civilians]{.underline}. Demanding other countries abide by international
rules, the alliance blatantly intervenes into domestic affairs of
sovereign states, waging wars at its will for selfish goals.

Now, [the bloc is diverting attention]{.underline} [from]{.underline}
the [Atlantic]{.underline} [to the
Asia]{.underline}-[Pacific]{.underline}, [repeatedly]{.underline}
[flexing muscles]{.underline} in the region [over recent
years]{.underline}. By inviting Japan to its summit, NATO, after
dragging parts of Europe into a war zone, has taken a step further to
mess up East Asia where no bombs have been dropped since the end of the
Cold War.

In essence, [**NATO is a tool** **by Washington** **for
hegemony**]{.underline}. [The U.S]{.underline}. has [long]{.underline}
[regarded]{.underline} the [growing China as]{.underline} [its stumbling
block]{.underline} in its pursuit of the world\'s only superpower.
**[Facing China\'s rising influence]{.underline}** on the global arena,
**[Washington]{.underline}**, [apart from its individual
provocations]{.underline} against this perceived rival, [**is eager to
form a united front to** **contain the country**, and **NATO is an ideal
mechanism for this aim**]{.underline}.

[Under]{.underline} the [pressure]{.underline} [of
Washington]{.underline}, [European]{.underline} [allies]{.underline}
repeatedly [took advantage]{.underline} of [the Ukraine crisis
to]{.underline} hype the \"China threat,\" deliberately
[linking]{.underline} the [conflicts]{.underline} [in
Ukraine]{.underline} to the Taiwan question. [Despite]{.underline}
[China\'s reiteration]{.underline} [of its pursuit of
peaceful]{.underline} [reunification]{.underline},
[European]{.underline} [politicians]{.underline} [have]{.underline},
[on]{.underline} several [occasions]{.underline},
\"[warned\"]{.underline} about [the possibility of China]{.underline}
using the Ukraine issue to launch \"aggression\" in the Indo-Pacific.
Apparently, [**NATO is acting in accordance** **with Washington\'s**
strategic **calculations** -- after forming a united front
**against**]{.underline} Russia, [it is again dancing to the U.S. tune
on **China**-related affairs.]{.underline}

Eric

[NATO]{.underline} [provides]{.underline} **[practical]{.underline}**
**[support]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[legitimacy]{.underline}**
[to US supremacy]{.underline}

First, even if NATO is viewed in purely transactional terms, leaving
aside values like solidarity among allies, it is a good deal for
Washington. [Americans calling for more equal
burden]{.underline}-[sharing]{.underline}, including Trump himself,
[suggest]{.underline} that [the US supports]{.underline} [NATO mostly
for altruistic reasons]{.underline}. In other words that America is
doing Europe a favor. But this picture is incomplete. [For]{.underline}
[the US military]{.underline}, **[NATO is a force
multiplier]{.underline}**, **[providing legitimacy to American
power]{.underline}**. [European allies]{.underline} [are]{.underline}
[engaged **in numerous missions**]{.underline} like Afghanistan, while
[the]{.underline} [United States **mostly calls the
shots**]{.underline}. [US bases in Europe not]{.underline} [only protect
European allies, but]{.underline} **[serve as logistics
hubs]{.underline}** **[to project power]{.underline}** into the Middle
East. **[These are assets the US military would not want to give
up.]{.underline}**

US defense policy is made strictly on US terms.

Second, the US defense budget does not depend on Europe's military
spending. It is misleading to argue that Europe must spend more so that
the United States can spend less. The Pentagon's budget is determined by
Washington's assessment of the capabilities necessary to maintain US
strategic dominance -- on its own, not through any alliance. When
Congress adopts the annual defense budget, European expenditures play a
marginal role. In 2017, President Trump increased the US defense budget,
despite the fact that European states also spent more (and Russia's
spending decreased by 20 percent). According to calculations by the
International Institute for Strategic Studies, US spending on NATO and
the defense of Europe amounts to \$30 billion, or just over 5 percent of
its defense budget. Comparing that figure to the roughly \$240 billion
of European spending for NATO, the imbalance no longer seems so great.
Given these numbers, it is also hard to argue that Europe is principally
to blame for a US defense budget of around \$600 billion.

[Looking]{.underline} specifically [at the cost of the US nuclear
arsenal, it]{.underline} [becomes even clearer]{.underline} [how
detached the]{.underline} [US budget]{.underline} [is from
burden-sharing in NATO]{.underline}. [Washington]{.underline}
[defines]{.underline} the [US nuclear]{.underline}
[strategy]{.underline} **[with little regard]{.underline}** [for
Europe's policy priorities]{.underline}. Over the next thirty years
(calculated from 2017), Washington plans a massive qualitative nuclear
build-up, spending \$400 billion on modernizing its nuclear arsenal --
in addition to the costs of maintaining existing systems. This move was
partly a reaction to Russian aggression in Ukraine, but above all a
concession by President Obama to the Republican Congress in exchange for
its approval of the 2014 New START treaty, in which the United States
and Russia pledged to limit numbers of strategic nuclear warheads. If
Trump were really interested in reducing costs, he would make serious
efforts on arms control. Instead, he refused Russia's offer to extend
the New START treaty beyond its 2021 expiration date and increased
spending on nuclear weapons by almost 20 percent. So, yes, [to some
extent Europe]{.underline} [is free-riding on US security guarantees.
But the]{.underline} **[reasons]{.underline}** [**include** the **US
desire for unrivalled military** and nuclear

### 1nc \-\-- Generic China Rise Good

#### China rise is inevitable\-\-- it's only a question of how the US reacts.

[For many observers outside China]{.underline}, especially in the US,
[there is no doubt that China is bent on replacing America as the
dominant power]{.underline} in the world (Mosher 2000). Indeed, for some
observers[, China's elites are following nothing less than a 100-year
plan to replace the US as the world's dominant power]{.underline}
(Pillsbury 2015). Prominent [realist scholars worry that there is a
certain structurally determined inevitability about both China's
rise]{.underline} and the [chances of a conflict between the US and the
PRC as the latter increasingly seeks to assert its growing power and
influence]{.underline} (Allison 2017). While Western IR's collective
failure to predict the end of the Cold War, the dramatic decline in
inter-state wars, or recognise the importance of national strategic
cultures and beliefs in shaping thinking about security, suggests that
[we should be very cautious about its collective epistemic
authority]{.underline}, there is no doubt that China's behaviour has
changed. [One of the most important expressions of this possibility can
be seen in the sophistication of China's political and diplomatic elites
as they have come to play a more prominent part in]{.underline} what
some IR theorists describe as '[international society']{.underline} and
the institutional architecture that constitutes it (Clark 2014). At one
level, hopes and expectations about China's leaders being 'socialised'
into the ways of Western diplomacy have been realised: China is nothing
like the disruptive, revolutionary force that it was under before
Richard M. Nixon and Henry Kissinger engineered the celebrated
rapprochement with the PRC (Kissinger 1994; van Ness 1970). At another
level, however, [it is clear that China's foreign policy goals continue
to reflect 'national interests']{.underline} and values, [especially
under the]{.underline} increasingly coordinated and [centralised
leadership of Xi]{.underline} Jinping (Lampton 2015). Indeed, not only
are Chinese policymakers still pursuing national goals, but they are
doing so in ways that are also often strikingly similar to those
employed by the US in an earlier era.

#### Slow economic growth is the key variable -- increasing US growth makes a [cling to hegemony]{.underline} inevitable that causes great power war

(Taliaferro, Jeffrey W. et al. (2018) Is Peaceful Change in World
Politics Always Desirable? A Neoclassical Realist Perspective.
International Studies Review, doi: 10.1093/isr/viy023

[Conflict between hegemon and challenger can take]{.underline} many
forms, ranging in intensity from a sustained rivalry for geopolitical
influence in one or more geographic regions to [a **major**]{.underline}
or **[hegemonic war]{.underline}**. Again, [we]{.underline} narrowly
[defined peaceful change as a process in which the hegemon **voluntarily
cedes** its dominant geopolitical role]{.underline} to a challenger in
one or more geographic regions. This may entail the hegemon withdrawing
its military forces and forward bases from a region, renegotiating, or
modifying alliances and economic agreements with regional states, often
at the behest of the challenger. It is important to note that peaceful
change might occur in one locale, while conflict might occur
simultaneously in another locale. Lastly, the likelihood of either of
the two outcomes---conflict and peaceful transition--- depends upon the
grand strategic adjustments by the hegemon as well as the challenger.

Neoclassical Realist Theory of Peaceful Change

Our neoclassical realist theory purports to explain the conditions under
which a regional or global hegemon will concede some or all of the
challenger's demands without contest. Like all neoclassical realist
theories, our theory assumes that all states respond to the
international constraints and opportunities they face but that how they
respond will be shaped by their domestic constraints (Rose 1988; Lobell,
Ripsman, and Taliaferro 2009; Ripsman, Taliaferro, and Lobell 2016).

Our argument is that [peaceful change is only likely]{.underline} in one
of three circumstances: (1) [when the hegemon's foreign policy
executive]{.underline} (FPE) [has high confidence that change is
inevitable because it **lacks the military, political, or economic
capabilities** to resist it]{.underline}; or (2) when the political and
economic costs of resisting that change are anticipated to be
prohibitively high; [or]{.underline} (3) [when the FPE is domestically
constrained in its ability to extract and mobilize the resources to
resist the challenger]{.underline}. [Each of these]{.underline} three
[propositions is a sufficient condition for the **hegemon to accept
peaceful change.**]{.underline} They combine to make a necessary
condition for peaceful change; that is, [unless one]{.underline} or more
[of them is obtained, **the hegemon will resist peaceful
change.**]{.underline} In this section, we unpack the logic underlying
each of these propositions.

The dependent variable (DV) is the pattern of strategic adjustment by
the hegemon. [A hegemon has two broad strategic choices in response to a
rising challenger: it can accept peaceful transition, or it
can]{.underline} resist it.7 Resistance entails a variety of strategies,
ranging from containment to preventive war. Economically, the hegemon
might deny the challenger access to its markets, use sanctions, employ
exchange and currency controls, and more broadly isolate the challenger
from trade to undermine the economic base for its military power.
Militarily, the hegemon could forge alliances with states along the
challenger's periphery, dramatically augment its own defense spending,
sabotage the challenger's weapons programs, seek to embroil the
challenger's armed forces in costly proxy conflicts, or, in the extreme,
**[initiate a preventive war]{.underline}** (Copeland 2000; Levy 2008,
2011).

A strategy of peaceful transition (or retrenchment) entails the
strategic reorientation away from confrontation with a challenger. The
hegemon, acknowledging the inevitability of the power transition, scales
back its military deployments and alliance commitments, relaxes or
removes economic sanctions targeting the challenger, and cedes its
leadership role to the challenger in formerly contested regions
(MacDonald and Parent 2011, 11--13).

The three propositions we derive from the theory specify the
combinations of neoclassical realism's systemic-level independent
variables (IVs) and domestic-level intervening variables (IVVs) that
increase the likelihood that a hegemon will pursue a resistance strategy
or a peaceful transition strategy.

Proposition 1 (the inevitability of international change) relates
directly to three IVs: the relative distribution of power, the nature of
the strategic environment that a hegemon confronts in a particular
region, and the degree of systemic clarity regarding threats and
opportunities. [Hegemons that enjoy an overall power advantage over
rising challengers are unlikely to see a future power transition as
inevitable.]{.underline} [Hegemons experiencing relative
decline]{.underline} or those that are simply at a marked disadvantage
in one or more categories of power vis-à-vis a challenger, however, [are
more likely to conclude that a power transition is
inevitable]{.underline}.

The second IV is the nature of the strategic environment that a hegemon
confronts in a contested region. A state's strategic environment refers
to the magnitude and the imminence of the external threats and
opportunities that it faces at any given time. All other things being
equal, the more imminent and dangerous the threat or the more fleeting
and enticing the opportunity, the more restrictive a state's strategic
environment will be. Conversely, the more remote and less intense the
threat or the more enduring and less enticing the opportunity, the more
permissive a state's strategic environment will be. Restrictive and
permissive strategic environments exist along a continuum (Ripsman et
al. 2016, 52--53).

Regional hegemons exercise geopolitical dominance over a single region.
A global hegemon, by definition, has wide interests across several
regions of the globe. Consequently, they can confront different
strategic environments across different regions. An increase or a
decrease in a challenger's economic, political, or military penetration
of a contested region, up to and including the conquest of all or part
of that region, can shift the strategic environment the hegemon faces
from permissive to restrictive or vice versa (Taliaferro 2018). Where a
global hegemon faces a restrictive strategic environment in a contested
region, it is more likely to conclude that the competitor will challenge
its leadership in the locale and that a power transition is inevitable.
Conversely, where it faces a permissive strategic environment in a
contested region, it is more likely to conclude that a power transition
is not inevitable.

The third IV is the degree of systemic clarity regarding threats and
opportunities. The degree of systemic clarity involves the signals or
information that states receive from the international system or a
regional sub-system. Systemic clarity has three subcomponents: (1) the
extent to which external threats or opportunities can be readily
identified, (2) whether the international system provides information
about the time horizon in which those threats or opportunities will
materialize, and (3) whether there is an "optimal" strategic response
(Ripsman et al. 2016, 46--47).

The logic here is that [if the hegemon judges that it has no
alternatives to prevent a power transition, it would be irrational to
waste resources resisting the inevitable]{.underline}. In general,
hegemons have different strategic options for countering challengers in
the short- and long-run. In the short-run, a hegmon can balance
internally by increasing its armaments or externally by seeking allies.
Over the longer turn, it has more options. **[Economic
growth]{.underline}** and emulation **[can redress relative
decline]{.underline}**. Nonetheless, [if the hegemon's leadership
calculates that it **lacks the resources for economic
growth**]{.underline} and emulation over the longer term[, and they also
calculate that the rising challenger's economic growth will likely
continue indefinitely]{.underline}, [they might conclude resistance is
futile.]{.underline} For instance, by 1901, recognizing the United
States' ascendency, Britain ceded leadership over the Western hemisphere
by signing the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty (Lobell 2003, 70--71). [In the late
1980s]{.underline}, Mikhail [Gorbachev realized that the depth of the
Soviet Union's relative economic decline made it impossible to continue
competing with the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [Gorbachev
scaled back military commitments]{.underline} in Eastern Europe and
elsewhere [and began to make unilateral concessions in nuclear and
conventional arms control]{.underline} (Brooks and Wohlforth 2000, 33).

[Military AI systems]{.underline} There are [a number GCRs associated
with military systems]{.underline}. Some potential scenarios: [military
robotics could become so cheap that drone swarms could cause enormous
damage to the human population]{.underline}; a [large autonomous army
could attack humans because of a command error;]{.underline} [billions
of nanobots with narrow AI could be created in a terrorist
attack]{.underline} and [create a global catastrophe]{.underline}
(Freitas 2000). In 2017, global attention was attracted to a viral video
about "slaughterbots" (Oberhaus 2017), hypothetical small drones able to
recognize humans and kill them with explosives. While such a scenario is
unlikely to pose a GCR, a [combination of cheap AI-powered drone
manufacture and high-precision AI-powered targeting could convert
**clouds of drones into weapons of mass destruction**]{.underline}. This
could [create a "drone swarms" arms race]{.underline}, similar to the
nuclear race. Such a race **[might result in an accidental global
war]{.underline}**, in which [two or more sides attack each other with
clouds of small killer drones]{.underline}. It is more likely that
[drones of this type would contribute to global instability]{.underline}
rather than cause a purely drone-based catastrophe. AI-controlled drones
could be delivered large distances by a larger vehicle, or they could be
solar powered; solar-powered airplanes already exist (Taylor 2017). Some
advanced forms of air defense will limit this risk, but [drones could
also jump]{.underline} (e.g., solar charging interspersed with short
flights), [crawl, or even move underground like worms]{.underline}.
[There are fewer barriers to drone war escalation than to nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. [Drones could also be used
anonymously]{.underline}, which might encourage their use under a false
flag. [Killer drones could also be used to suppress political
dissent]{.underline}, perhaps **[creating global
totalitarianism]{.underline}**. Other risks of military AI have been
previously discussed (Turchin and Denkenberger 2018a).

[Stuxnet-style viruses hack global critical infrastructure]{.underline}
A narrow AI virus [may also affect civilian infrastructure]{.underline};
some, but not all ways in which this could be possible are listed below.
Remember that in the case of global catastrophes, [the conditions
necessary for most catastrophes could exist simultaneously]{.underline}.
Several distinctive scenarios of such a catastrophe have been suggested.
For example, [autopilot-controlled and hacked planes could crash into
nuclear power stations]{.underline}. [There are around 1000 nuclear
facilities in the world]{.underline}, and thousands of large planes are
in the air at every moment---[most of them have computerized
autopilots]{.underline}. Coordinated plane attacks happened in 2001 and
a plane has been hacked (Futureworld 2013). [Self-driving cars could
hunt people]{.underline}, and it is projected that most new cars after
2030 will have some self-driving capabilities (Anderson 2017). Elon Musk
has spoken about the risks of [AI living in the Internet]{.underline};
it [could start wars by manipulating fake news]{.underline} (Wootson
2017[). Computer viruses could also manipulate human behavior using
blackmail]{.underline}, as seen in fiction in an episode of Black Mirror
(Watkins 2016). Another example is creating suicide ideation, e.g., the
recent internet suicide game in Russia, "Blue Whale" (Mullin 2017),
which allegedly killed 130 teenagers by sending them tasks of increasing
complexity and finally requesting their suicide. [The IoT will make home
infrastructure vulnerable]{.underline} (Granoff 2016). [Home electrical
systems could have short circuits and start fires]{.underline}; phones
could also catch fire. Other scenarios are also possible: h[ome
robots]{.underline}, which may become popular in the next few decades,
[could start to attack people; infected factories could produce toxic
chemicals after being hacked by viruses]{.underline}. Large-scale
[infrastructure failure may result in the collapse of technological
civilization and famine]{.underline} (Hanson 2008; Cole et al. 2016). As
[industries]{.underline} become increasingly computerized, they [will
completely depend on proper functioning of computers]{.underline}, while
in the past they could continue without them. [These industries include
power generation, transport, and food production]{.underline}. As the
trend continues, [turning off computers will leave humans without food,
heating, and medication]{.underline}. [Many industries become dangerous
if their facilities are not intensively maintained, including nuclear
plants, spent nuclear fuel storage systems, weapons systems, and water
dams]{.underline}. If one compares human civilization with a
multicellular organism, one could see that multicellular organisms could
die completely, down to the last cell, as the result of a very small
intervention. [As interconnectedness and computerization of the human
civilization grow, we become more and more vulnerable to
information-based attacks]{.underline}.

[Slaughterbots]{.underline} and the dangers of a robotic army [Robotic
minds do not require full AGI to have some form of agency:]{.underline}
[they have goals]{.underline}, subgoals, and a world model, including a
model of their place in the world. For example, a robotic car should
predict the future situation on a road, including the consequences of
its own actions. It also has a main goal---travel from A to B---which
constantly results in changes to the subgoal system in the form of route
creation. A combination of [this type of limited intelligence with
limited agency may be used to turn such systems into dangerous
self-targeting weapons]{.underline} (Turchin and Denkenberger 2018b).
Commentary on narrow AI viruses [It appears that if a narrow AI virus
were to affect only one of the above-listed domains, it would not result
in an extinction-level catastrophe]{.underline}. [However, it is
possible that there will be many such viruses]{.underline}, [or a
multipandemic]{.underline} (Turchin et al. 2017), [or one narrow AI that
will be able to affect almost all existing computers and computerized
systems]{.underline}. [In this case, if the virus(es) were deliberately
programmed to create maximum damage]{.underline}---which could be in a
case of a military grade Narrow AI virus, like the advanced version of
Stuxnet (Kushner 2013)---**[global catastrophe is a possible
result]{.underline}**. If the appearance of narrow AI viruses is
gradual, antivirus companies may be able to prepare for them.
Alternatively, [humans could turn off the most vulnerable systems to
avoid a global catastrophe]{.underline}. However, **[a sudden
breakthrough or a synchronized surprise attack could spell
doom.]{.underline}** [Failure of nuclear deterrence AI]{.underline}
Nuclear weapons are one of the most automated weapon systems. [Because
they must be launched immediately, almost all decision making has been
done in advance]{.underline}. An early warning alert starts a
preprogrammed chain of events, where the high-level decision should be
made in minutes, which is far from optimal for human decision-making.
However, [the history of nuclear near misses shows]{.underline} (Blair
2011) [that computer mistakes have been one of the main
causes]{.underline}, [and only quick human intervention has prevented
nuclear war]{.underline}, e.g., the actions of Stanislav Petrov in 1983
(Future of Life Institute 2016). **[We can imagine failure modes of
accidental nuclear war resulting from failure of the nuclear weapons
control system]{.underline}**. They may be [similar to the Russian "dead
hand" perimeter system]{.underline} (Bender 2014), [arising if a
strategic planning AI chooses a dangerous plan to "win" a nuclear war,
like a Doomsday weapon]{.underline} (Kahn 1959), [blackmail, or a

Mind crime Another failure mode for a project, especially a project
whose interests incorporate moral considerations, is what we might refer
to as **[[mind crime]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is similar to
infrastructure profusion in that it concerns a potential side effect of
actions undertaken by the AI for instrumental reasons. But in mind
crime, the side effect is not external to the AI; rather, it concerns
what happens within the AI itself (or within the computational processes
it generates). [This failure mode deserves its own designation because
it [is easy to overlook yet]{.mark} potentially **[deeply
problematic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Normally, we do not regard what is
going on inside a computer as having any moral significance except
insofar as it affects things outside. But [a machine superintelligence
could create **internal processes that have moral status**]{.underline}.
For example, [a very **detailed simulation**]{.underline} of some actual
or hypothetical human mind [might be **conscious**]{.underline} [and in
many ways **comparable to an emulation**]{.underline}. [One can imagine
scenarios in which an [AI creates **trillions of** ]{.mark}**such
[conscious simulations]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [perhaps in [order to
improve its understanding of human psychology]{.mark} and sociology.
These simulations might be placed in simulated environments and
subjected to various stimuli, and their reactions studied. [Once their
informational usefulness has been exhausted, they might be
**destroyed**]{.mark}]{.underline} (much as lab rats are routinely
sacrificed by human scientists at the end of an experiment). [If such
practices were applied to beings that have high moral
status]{.underline}---such as simulated humans or many other types of
sentient mind---[the [outcome]{.mark} might be **[equivalent to genocide
and]{.mark} thus [extremely morally
problematic]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The]{.underline}

Conclusion Our analysis shows that the AI risks field is much more
varied than accepted by the two main points of view: (1) AI as job-taker
and (2) AI that quickly takes over the world. [AI could pose a global
catastrophic risk in the very early stages or at the very late stages of
its evolution]{.underline}. No single solution can be capable of
covering all risks of AI. [Even if AI is banned, other global problems
will arise in its absence]{.underline}; [thus]{.underline},
**[controlling AI safety requires a complex and continuous
effort]{.underline}**. It is especially worrying that the risks of
narrow AI viruses and early self-improving AI (young AI) are neglected
by both camps. Such [risks are nearer in time and not overshadowed by
other potential risks]{.underline}. In addition, [these risks cannot be
solved by the mechanisms proposed to control more advanced
AI]{.underline}, such as AI alignment. The [risks]{.underline} of
conflict between two benevolent AIs or halting of late-stage AI [have
also generally been ignored]{.underline}. **[Most of the risks discussed
here could happen within a very short period of time, less than a
decade]{.underline}**, and could have very different natures. More study
is needed to address these urgent risks.

### 2nc \-\-- War Impact

#### That causes extinction

**Wittner, 11** - Emeritus Professor of History at the State University
of New York \[Lawrence, November 28, Huntington News, COMMENTARY: Is a
Nuclear War with China Possible?, <http://www.huntingtonnews.net/14446>,
accessed 7/3/16, GE\]

[While nuclear weapons exist, there remains a danger that they will be
used]{.underline}. After all, for centuries national conflicts have led
to wars, with nations employing their deadliest weapons. The current
[deterioration of U.S. relations with China might]{.underline} end up
[provid]{.underline}ing [us with]{.underline} yet another example of
[this]{.underline} phenomenon.

The [[gathering tension between the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and China is clear]{.underline}]{.mark}
enough[[. Disturbed by China's growing economic and military
strength]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the U.S. government recently challenged
China's claims in the South China Sea,]{.underline}]{.mark} increased
the U.S. military presence in Australia, and deepened U.S. military ties
with other nations in the Pacific region. According to Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton, the United States was "asserting our own position
as a Pacific power."

But need this lead to nuclear war?

Not necessarily. And yet, there are signs that it could. After all, both
the United States and China possess large numbers of nuclear weapons.
The U.S. government threatened to attack China with nuclear weapons
during the Korean War and, later, during the conflict over the future of
China's offshore islands, Quemoy and Matsu. In the midst of the latter
confrontation, President Dwight Eisenhower declared publicly, and
chillingly, that U.S. nuclear weapons would "be used just exactly as you
would use a bullet or anything else."

Of course, China didn't have nuclear weapons then. Now that it does,
perhaps the behavior of national leaders will be more temperate. But the
loose nuclear threats of U.S. and Soviet government officials during the
Cold War, when both nations had vast nuclear arsenals, should convince
us that, even as the military ante is raised, nuclear saber-rattling
persists.

Some pundits argue that nuclear weapons prevent wars between
nuclear-armed nations; and, admittedly, there haven't been very
many---at least not yet. But the Kargil War of 1999, between
nuclear-armed India and nuclear-armed Pakistan, should convince us that
such wars can occur. Indeed, in that case, the conflict almost slipped
into a nuclear war. Pakistan's foreign secretary threatened that, if the
war escalated, his country felt free to use "any weapon" in its arsenal.
During the conflict, Pakistan did move nuclear weapons toward its
border, while India, it is claimed, readied its own nuclear missiles for
an attack on Pakistan.

At the least, though, don't nuclear weapons deter a nuclear attack? Do
they? Obviously, NATO leaders didn't feel deterred, for, throughout the
Cold War, NATO's strategy was to respond to a Soviet conventional
military attack on Western Europe by launching a Western nuclear attack
on the nuclear-armed Soviet Union. Furthermore, if U.S. government
officials really believed that nuclear deterrence worked, they would not
have resorted to championing "Star Wars" and its modern variant,
national missile defense. Why are these vastly expensive---and probably
unworkable---military defense systems needed if other nuclear powers are
deterred from attacking by U.S. nuclear might?

Of course, the bottom line for those Americans convinced that nuclear
weapons safeguard them from a Chinese nuclear attack might be that the
U.S. nuclear arsenal is far greater than its Chinese counterpart.
[Today, it is estimated that the U.S. government possesses over five
thousand nuclear warheads, while the Chinese government has a total
inventory of roughly three hundred. Moreover, only about forty of these
Chinese nuclear weapons can reach the United States.]{.underline} Surely
the United States would "win" any nuclear war with China.

But what would that "victory" entail? A [nuclear attack by China would
immediately slaughter at least **10 million Americans** in a great storm
of blast and fire, while leaving many more dying horribly of sickness
and radiation poisoning]{.underline}. [The [Chinese death toll in a
nuclear war would be far higher. Both nations would be reduced to
smoldering, radioactive wasteland]{.underline}]{.mark}s. Also,
[**[radioactive debris sent aloft by the nuclear explosions would blot
out the sun and bring on a "nuclear winter" around the
globe---destroying agriculture, creating worldwide famine]{.mark}, and
generating chaos and destruction**.]{.underline} Moreover, in another
decade the extent of this catastrophe would be far
wors**[e]{.underline}**. The Chinese government is currently expanding
its nuclear arsenal, and **[by the year 2020 it is expected to more than
double its number of nuclear weapons that can hit the United
States]{.underline}**. The U.S. government, in turn, has plans to spend
hundreds of billions of dollars "modernizing" its nuclear weapons and
nuclear production facilities over the next decade.

great power rivalry" Review of International Studies, Volume 40 / Issue
01 / January 2014, pp 125-152

Rivalries between great powers over dominance have captured scholarly
attention since the days of Thucydides. However, the bulk of studies
have concentrated on shifts in capabilities, while neglecting the
motives that produce such positional rivalries. The status anxiety
hypothesis is an effort to address this omission, by tracing their
occurrence and continuation, sometimes for decades, to the clashing
status requirements of the dominant power and those of the next-in-line
state. In a nutshell, [[status anxiety argues that the **refusal of the
dominant power** to allow the succession of the challenger will be a
fundamental cause of rivalry, worsening as the rising power threatens to
overtake the current leader]{.underline}]{.mark} in additional
dimensions. The purpose of this article was to formulate this hypothesis
as well as subject it to preliminary testing. The findings suggest [that
[status anxiety represented a significant
influence]{.mark}]{.underline}, though not necessarily excluding
additional balance of power considerations, [[in the foreign policy
decision-making of declining dominant powers:]{.underline}]{.mark}
France in the mid-eighteenth century and Britain at the turn of the
twentieth century. Status anxiety thus helps account for the hostility
France manifested towards Britain, and Britain towards German demands
for superior status, a reaction which is more problematic to account for
by theories stressing solely physical security and material gains.

A further contribution of this endeavour is that it suggests the
existence of a dominant power club, distinct from the club of major or
great powers, and, as such, following a different set of rules.138 The
existing status literature has concentrated exclusively on the latter
club, arguing persuasively that there is no impediment for granting
either admission to new members or opportunities for further advancement
to current ones.139 Hence, status competition in the great power club is
seen as non-zero sum. But the dominant power club has a membership of
one, which makes it unfeasible for the dominant power to satisfy the
demands of dominant power aspirants without voluntarily surrendering its
supremacy. Accordingly, [[status competition over the dominant position
is more likely to be zero-sum and lead to rivalry.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The findings of this article are at this point only plausible, yet they
highlight the need for further research covering the entire universe of
dominant powers in order to determine both if intense status anxiety
always prompts conflict and if reduced status anxiety or its absence
lead to stability. Consequently, additional studies of the role of
status for dominant powers foreign policy should be conducted, extending
beyond the current en vogue concentration on the foreign policy of
rising powers alone.

Indeed, [[dominant powers\' status anxiety may be increasingly
policy-relevant, if unipolarity were to erode due to a steady shrinking
of distance between the US and China]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This is not
to suggest that Sino-American confrontation under the]{.mark} ominous
[**shadow of nuclear weapons** is inevitable, but to draw attention to
the possible **heightened risks posed by status
anxiety**]{.mark}]{.underline} in future decades. In the words of
President Obama: 'if other nations do not play for second place, I do
not accept second-place for the United States of America'.140

#### [Clinging on]{.underline} to the inevitable decline of Western hegemony results in Sino-American war

Even as it stays within the post-1945 international order, Beijing is
not doing so to preserve it. In this sense, as Martin Jacques has
observed, [China is playing a double game. It is operating 'both within
and outside the existing international system while at the same
time]{.underline}, [in effect, sponsoring a new China-centric
international system which will exist alongside the present system and
probably slowly begin to usurp it]{.underline}'.87 The creation of the
AIIB, which Beijing intends should ultimately eclipse the IMF and World
Bank, is a good example of this strategy. American scholars and
policy-makers believe that [a lock-in strategy can be employed to head
off any Chinese attempt to create a new international order, or to
create a parallel order.]{.underline} They believe this because they
have imbued the concept of a 'rules-based, institutionalized, liberal
international order' with a talismanic quality. In so doing they have
air-brushed Great Power politics out of the picture. [As they see it,
rules and institutions are politically neutral and, ipso facto,
beneficial for all. Hence, they can be an **effective substitute for
declining hard power**]{.underline}. However, rather than existing
separately from the balance of power, rules, norms and institutions
reflect it. [Hence the world is no more likely to continue upholding the
Pax Americana once US power declines than Britain's dominions and former
colonies were inclined to perpetuate the empire after the Second World
War]{.underline}. [The fate of the Pax Americana, and that of the
international order, **will be determined by the outcome of the
Sino-American rivalry.**]{.underline} As the British scholar E. H. Carr
observed, a rules-based international order 'cannot be understood
independently of the political foundation on which it rests and the
political interests which it serves'.88 The post-Second World War
interna- tional order is an American order that privileges US
interests.89 Even the discourse of 'liberal order' cannot disguise this
fact. Today, the ground is shifting beneath the Pax Americana's
foundations. Those who believe that lock-in can work view international
politics as being, in essence, geopolitically antiseptic. For them,
Great Power competition and conflict are transcended by international
institu- tions, rules and norms. This is not how the real world works,
however.[90 Great Power politics is about power. Rules and institutions
do not exist in a vacuum, hermetically sealed off from Great Power
politics. Nor are they neutral. Rather, they reflect the distribution of
power in the international system. In international politics, who rules
makes the rules.]{.underline} In his classic study of international
relations between the world wars, The Twenty years' crisis, Carr
analysed the political crisis of the 1930s caused by the breakdown of
the post-First World War order symbolized by the Versailles Treaty.91
The Versailles system cracked, Carr argued, because of the widening gap
between the order it represented and the actual distribution of power in
Europe. Carr used the events of the 1930s to make a larger geopolitical
point. International orders reflect the balance of power that exists at
time of their creation. Over time, however, the relative power of states
changes, and eventually the international order no longer reflects the
actual distribution of power between or among the leading Great Powers.
When that happens, the legitimacy of the prevailing order is called into
question, and it will be challenged by the rising power(s). [When the
balance of power swings---or is perceived to swing---in its direction, a
rising power becomes increasingly dissatisfied with the international
order, and **seeks to revise it**.]{.underline} The challenger wants to
change the rules embodied in the existing international order---rules
written, of course, by the once dominant but now declining Great Power
that created it. It also wants the allocation of prestige and status
changed to reflect its newly acquired power. The incumbent hegemon, of
course, wants to preserve the existing international order as is---an
order that it midwifed to advance, and consolidate, its own interests.
The E. H. Carr Moment presents the incumbent hegemon with a choice. [It
can dig in its heels and try to preserve the prevailing order---and its
privileged position therein; or it can accede to the rising challenger's
demands for revision. If it chooses the former course of action, **it
runs the risk of war with the dissatisfied challenger.**]{.underline} If
it chooses the latter, it must come to terms with the reality of its
decline, and the end of its hegemonic position. The E. H. Carr Moment is
where the geopolitical rubber meets the road[: the status quo power(s)
must choose between accommodating or opposing the revisionist demands of
the rising power(s).]{.underline} Liberal internationalists such as John
Ikenberry argue that China will not challenge the current international
order, even as the distribution of power continues to shift in its
favour. This is a doubtful proposition. [The geopolitical question---the
E. H. Carr Moment---of our time is whether the declining hegemon in east
Asia, the United States, will try to preserve a status quo that is
becoming increasingly out of sync with the shifting distribution of
power, or whether it can reconcile itself to a rising China's
revisionist demands that the international order in east Asia be
realigned to reflect the emerging power realities]{.underline}. [Unless
the United States can adjust gracefully to this tectonic geopolitical
shift, the chances of a Sino-American war are high---as they always are
during power transitions.92 However, **whether change comes peacefully
or violently**, the Pax Americana's days are numbered.]{.underline}

#### Attempting to sustain US primacy guarantees conflict and wrecks relations

**Swaine, 15 --** senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace and one of the most prominent American analysts in
Chinese security studies (Michael, "The Real Challenge in the Pacific: A
Response to \"How to Deter China\"" Foreign Affairs, May/June, proquest)

For most of the postwar era, these perspectives coexisted relatively
easily, primarily because Beijing was too weak to push its own view and
was able to rise steadily within the U.S.-sponsored order. But times
have changed; [China has outgrown its subordinate status and now feels
strong enough to press its case in the western Pacific.]{.underline}

This development should not be surprising to anyone who understands
modern Chinese history and great-power transitions. Beijing has an
ongoing incentive to work with Washington and the West to sustain
continued economic growth and to address a growing array of common
global and regional concerns, from pandemics to climate change to
terrorism. At the same time, it understandably wishes to reduce its
vulnerability to potential future threats from the United States and
other nations while increasing its overall influence along its
strategically important maritime periphery. [As its overseas power and
influence grow, its foreign interests expand, and its domestic
nationalist backers become more assertive, Beijing will naturally become
less willing to accept unconditionally military, political, and economic
relationships]{.underline} and structures that [it believes
disproportionately]{.underline} and unjustly [favor Western powers. And
it will increasingly worry that Washington might resort to pressure or
force]{.underline} to try to undermine Chinese security moves in the
western Pacific and head off the United States\' impending relative
decline.

Many Chinese observers now believe that Beijing\'s past weakness and its
need to cooperate with the United States and the West in general have
made it too accommodating or passive in dealing with perceived
challenges to China\'s vital national interests, from U.S. support for
Taiwan and Asian disputants over maritime claims to close-up U.S.
surveillance and other intelligence-gathering activities along the
Chinese coast. The more extreme variants of this nationalist viewpoint
threaten to transform China\'s long-standing \"peaceful development\"
policy, which focuses on the maintenance of amicable relations with the
United States and other powers, into a more hard-edged approach aimed at
more actively undermining U.S. influence in Asia. The so-called
bottom-line concept of Chinese President Xi Jinping\'s foreign policy is
an apparent step in this direction, stressing in an unprecedented manner
the need for China to stand resolute in managing territorial and
sovereignty issues in the East China and South China Seas.

Observing these stirrings, meanwhile, many American and other foreign
observers see the beginnings of a larger effort to eject the United
States from Asia and eventually replace it as the regional, and possibly
even global, superpower. [China\'s greater assertiveness regarding
maritime territorial disputes and U.S. and Japanese intelligence and
surveillance activities along its coastline are interpreted as tests of
U.S. and allied resolve]{.underline}, a prelude to the creation of no-go
zones essential for the establishment of Chinese control over the
western Pacific. In this view, the proper course of action for
Washington is to decisively disabuse Beijing of its aspirations by
enhancing U.S. predominance, increasing Chinese vulnerability in the
western Pacific, and making clear who is boss, right up to China\'s
12-nautical-mile territorial waters.

[The problem with this outlook]{.underline}- implicit in the concept of
Archipelagic Defense that Krepinevich proposes-[is that it misdiagnoses
China\'s motivations and thus exacerbates]{.underline}, rather than
mitigates, [the underlying problem. Beijing\'s de facto attempts to
limit or end U.S. predominance along its maritime periphery are
motivated by uncertainty, insecurity, and opportunism rather than a
grand strategic vision of Chinese predominance]{.underline}. [Chinese
leaders today are not trying to carve out an exclusionary sphere of
influence]{.underline}, especially in hard-power terms; [they are trying
to reduce their considerable vulnerability]{.underline} and increase
their political, diplomatic, and economic leverage in their own
backyard. This is a much less ambitious and in many ways more
understandable goal for a continental great power. It does not
necessarily threaten vital U.S. or allied interests, and it can and
should be met with understanding rather than defensive aggressiveness.

UNSUSTAINABLE TRENDS

Continued U.S. predominance in the western Pacific cannot be justified
by the need to resist a Chinese drive to replace it, nor is it necessary
in order to ensure regional (and global) order. [It is inconceivable
that Beijing will accept U.S. predominance in perpetuity and that it
will grant the United States complete freedom of action in the Pacific
and recognize its ability to prevail militarily in a potential conflict.
Trying to sustain such predominance, therefore, is actually the quickest
route to instability, practically guaranteeing an arms race, increased
regional polarization, and reduced cooperation between Washington and
Beijing on common global challenges]{.underline}. And [even if some
Chinese leaders were tempted to accept continued U.S. predominance, they
would almost certainly end up meeting fierce and sustained domestic
criticism for doing so]{.underline} as China\'s power grows [and would
likely end up reversing course to ensure their political
survival]{.underline}.

Trying to sustain American military predominance in the region,
meanwhile, will become increasingly difficult and expensive. A recent
study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (which I
co-authored) on the long-term security environment in Asia concluded
that the United States will remain the strongest military power on a
global level for many years to come. But this study also found that
Washington will almost certainly confront increasingly severe
economically induced limitations on its defense spending that will
constrain its efforts to keep well ahead of a growing Chinese military
and paramilitary presence within approximately 1,500 nautical miles of
the Chinese coastline (that is, the area covered by the so-called first
island chain).

The barriers to maritime predominance, however, apply to China as well
as the United States. The Carnegie Endowment study also concluded that
U.S. military power in Asia will almost certainly remain very strong and
that even increased Chinese regional military capabilities will not
offer Beijing unambiguous superiority. Any Chinese attempt to establish
predominance in Asia would fail, therefore, both because it would be
difficult for China to surpass the United States and because a scenario
of this kind would frighten bystanders and drive them into Washington\'s
arms.

[Chinese leaders]{.underline} understand this and so [are highly
unlikely to seek predominance if they feel that they can achieve a
decent amount of security in less confrontational ways]{.underline}.
They are likely to seek some form of predominance (as opposed to acting
merely opportunistically and in a more limited manner) only if
Washington\'s words and actions convince them that even the minimal
level of security they seek requires it. Unfortunately, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates\' [adoption of aggressive
military concepts- such as Air-Sea Battle]{.underline}, Offshore
Control, or even Archipelagic Defense-[would deny them such security and
thus contribute to an ever-worsening security dilemma]{.underline}.

THE NEED FOR MORE STABILITY

For both the United States and China, therefore, [the primary future
strategic challenge is finding a way to develop a mutually beneficial
means of transitioning from U.S. predominance toward a stable, more
equitable balance of power]{.underline} in the western Pacific-one in
which neither nation has the clear capacity to prevail in an armed
conflict, but in which both countries believe that their vital interests
can nonetheless remain secure.

[This will]{.underline} be difficult to achieve and potentially
dangerous. It will not only require a variety of crisis-management and
confidence-building mechanisms, beyond what have been developed thus far
in Asia, but also [necessitate high levels of strategic reassurance and
restraint]{.underline}. Many knowledgeable observers have offered
recommendations designed to reduce mistrust and enhance cooperation
between Washington and Beijing, involving everything from caps on U.S.
and Chinese defense spending to mutual, limited concessions on Taiwan
and the ongoing maritime disputes. Many of these initiatives make sense.
But they fail to address the real underlying problem- namely, China\'s
unwillingness to continue to accept a clearly subordinate military
position along its maritime periphery.

To reduce the risk of conflict and enhance the opportunities for
cooperation, Washington and Beijing will need to reach reliable
understandings regarding the future long-term status of the Korean
Peninsula and Taiwan, the management of maritime territorial disputes in
the East China and South China Seas, and the scope and function of
non-Chinese military activities within the first island chain (or at
least within both China\'s and Japan\'s exclusive economic zones). Such
understandings should almost certainly involve some credible form of
neutralization of these areas as sources of growing contention or as
locations from which to project U.S. or Chinese power, creating a de
facto buffer zone along China\'s maritime periphery. Only these kinds of
moves will provide the mutual strategic assurance required to maintain a
stable security environment over the long term.

In the case of North and South Korea, this strategy would imply the
emergence of a unified, nonaligned (or only loosely aligned) peninsula
free from foreign military forces. Such an outcome would need to rest on
credible security assurances by both the United States and China that a
unified Korea would remain free from coercion and always open to close
economic and political relations with both countries. Such assurances
might involve the continuation in some form of a security relationship
with Washington, although one that is greatly reduced, at least in the
short to medium term. This process might also require Japan to provide
security assurances to a unified Korea, at least to the extent of not
acquiring nuclear weapons or some types of conventional weapons that the
latter might find threatening, such as precision ballistic and cruise
missile strike capabilities.

[In the case of Taiwan, it would require, as a first step, a
U.S.-Chinese understanding regarding restrictions on U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan, along with verifiable limits on relevant Chinese military
production and deployments, including of ballistic missiles and strike
aircraft. Beijing would also likely need to provide credible assurances
that it would not use force against Taiwan]{.underline} in any
contingency [short of an outright Taiwanese declaration of de jure
independence or the U.S. placement of forces on the island]{.underline}.

[In the past, Beijing has resisted providing assurances regarding any
nonuse of force]{.underline} toward the island, [viewing guarantees of
this kind as a limit on Chinese sovereignty]{.underline} over Taiwan.
[However]{.underline}, similar to the case of the Korean Peninsula,
[Beijing would likely view such a shift in its stance toward Taiwan as
acceptable if it were necessary to stabilize the western
Pacific]{.underline}; [Chinese leaders might also regard it as a step
toward]{.underline} the [eventual unification]{.underline} of the island
with the mainland. In addition, Beijing would likely need to accept that
such unification could occur only through a peaceful process involving
the willing consent of the people of Taiwan and that it might take
decades. [Washington]{.underline}, for its part, [would likely need to
provide assurances to Beijing that it would neither place forces on the
island nor provide any new level of defense assistance to Taipei, **as
long as Beijing abided by its own assurances**.]{.underline} And both
countries would need to consult closely with both Taiwan and Japan at
each step of this process and provide clear and credible assurances
regarding the understanding reached between them.

Napoleon is said to have predicted that, [when China woke from its
slumbers, it would \"astonish the world]{.underline}.\" The Little
Corporal was a loquacious fellow who got much wrong but he seems to have
gotten this right. In a mere three decades, [China has risen from
impotence and backwardness to a leading position in global
affairs]{.underline}. [This year it will become the second biggest
producer of goods and services]{.underline}, something projected just
five years ago to happen only in 2020. [China is clearly on the way to
regaining its historic position as the world\'s largest
economy]{.underline}, [displacing the United States]{.underline}. (Given
continued rapid growth in the Chinese economy, slow growth elsewhere,
and progressive revaluation of the Renminbi Yuan, this could happen much
sooner than many expect.) [The prospect of transcendent Chinese wealth
and power, coupled with America\'s devaluation of its own political and
economic prestige, has led to mounting speculation about China\'s
emergence as a global hegemon to]{.underline} rival and, perhaps in
time, [surpass the United States]{.underline}. Not so long ago, in the
Cold War, the world order was defined by the relationship between the
Soviet Union and America as the overlords of rival blocs of nations.
Recalling this, [some pundits foresee the reemergence of a bipolar world
in which the United States and China exercise joint
leadership]{.underline} in a so-called \"G-2.\" With the collapse of the
USSR, there have been no rivals to American leadership when Washington
has chosen to lead. The United States --- which spends more on its
military than the rest of the world combined --- has enjoyed absolute
military superiority in every region of the globe. [Some imagine China
as a \"peer competitor\" for global dominance]{.underline}. Since 1974,
when Deng Xiaoping addressed the United Nations General Assembly in New
York, China has been at pains to deny any possibility that it might seek
such dominance. As the Chinese defense \"white paper\" put it last year:
\"*China will never seek hegemony or engage in military expansion now or
in the future, no matter how developed it becomes.*\" In saying this,
[China is inadvertently echoing the American isolationists of the
nineteenth and early twentieth century]{.underline}. The United States
did not then seek to dominate or control the international state system,
nor did it pursue military solutions to problems far from its shores. In
time and in reaction to events, [however]{.underline}, [America came to
do both]{.underline}. Why has China, alone among nations, felt obliged
to assert that it does not aspire to regional or global hegemony? Is
this simply propaganda, intended to distinguish Beijing from Brezhnev\'s
Moscow or from the militarism of contemporary Washington? Is it a
contrite acknowledgment and repudiation of imperial China\'s past
hegemonic status in East Asia? Or is it sincere counsel to future
generations of Chinese not to bully their neighbors or the world once
they have the power to do so? If so, is there something unique about
China that causes its leaders to believe they must make a special effort
to resist deep-seated hegemonic impulses? This has become a timely
question. [After a couple of bad centuries, China is back]{.underline}.
[It believes]{.underline}, with some justification, [that for most of
its history it was the largest, wealthiest, best governed, and
technologically most advanced society]{.underline} on the planet. [China
brims with confidence that it can regain this status, which it considers
the natural order of affairs, and that it will do so in this
century]{.underline}. [Analogies to other rising powers]{.underline}
with shallower histories --- France, the United States, Germany, Japan,
the USSR --- [are not helpful in predicting the
consequences]{.underline} of China\'s rise. China has no messianic
ideology to export; no doctrine of \"manifest destiny\" to advance; no
belief in social Darwinism or imperative of territorial expansion to act
upon; no cult of the warrior to animate militarism or glorify war; no
exclusion from contemporary global governance to overcome; no satellite
states to garrison; no overseas colonies or ideological dependencies to
protect; no history of power projection or military intervention beyond
its immediate frontiers; no entangling alliances or bases abroad. [China
has a very persuasive explanation of its national
interests]{.underline}. It says it needs domestic tranquility and peace
on its borders in order to pursue its continued modernization and
economic development. It seems very comfortable with a multipolar world
order, where peace and economic growth prevail. But [anyone with
experience of negotiating with the Chinese can attest that they are
capable of both haughtiness and petulance]{.underline}. Some of this
sort of conduct seems to have been on display at Copenhagen last month.
How a still-more-powerful China conducts itself in the future will be
decided in part by Chinese realities as shaped by Chinese history. But
[Chinese behavior will also reflect how the rest of the
world]{.underline}, including most notably the incumbent hegemon --- the
United States --- reacts and interacts with China as China rises. And
[future Chinese conduct cannot be separated from the character of
China\'s domestic politics]{.underline}. [An autocracy that feels free
to ignore the rule of law at home is unlikely to defer to international
law and procedure abroad]{.underline}. Whatever the meaning of China\'s
assurances that it will not pursue hegemony or engage in military
expansionism in future, we cannot be certain that it will not. There are
grounds for optimism, especially with respect to China\'s use of
military power. China\'s history includes examples of aggressive actions
along its borders --- especially in Korea and Vietnam. But overall China
has been notable for its cautious, defensive, and inward-looking
national security posture. The Great Wall stands as a symbol of this as
does the scuttling of the Ming fleet in 1437. Despite a formidable
history of innovation in military technology and warfare on a scale
commensurate with its huge population and vast size, the Chinese
strategic tradition stresses that weapons are inauspicious instruments
to be used only when the use of force is unavoidable. The People\'s
Republic of China has used force when measures short of war have proven
inadequate to secure its borders or strategic interests (as in Korea,
India, and Vietnam), but, by marked contrast with India in Goa or
Indonesia in Timor-Leste, it gave diplomacy the decades needed to
resolve the Hong Kong and Macau issues without bloodshed. Beijing has
shown a similar preference for negotiations rather than the use of force
to settle the Taiwan issue. Cross-strait tensions are lessening. It
should be encouraging that China has insisted on United Nations
authorization for its military activities abroad, which are directed at
peacekeeping and against piracy. Still, [China is modernizing its
military at a peculiar moment of history]{.underline}. The United States
inherited worldwide military superiority from the collapse of its Soviet
rival. Without much discussion, it has embraced the neo-conservative
agenda of sustaining this superiority at all costs. But [rising Chinese
defense capabilities erode American supremacy]{.underline}. China\'s new
anti-carrier weapons endanger U.S. force projection capabilities in the
Western Pacific; its anti-satellite programs imperil U.S. global
surveillance and communication capabilities; its growing operations in
cyberspace menace U.S. government operations and the economy of the
American homeland alike. These are [serious challenge]{.underline}s not
just [to American hegemony]{.underline} but to core U.S. interests. They
have begun to draw a response. The result is a deeply troubled
Sino-American military relationship despite the diminishing prospects
for war in the Taiwan Strait. [China will persevere in its efforts to
build a credible counter to American coercion]{.underline}. The United
States will not soon abandon its obsession with the retention of
absolute military superiority everywhere[. A less hegemonic objective
would allow the U.S. to accommodate a more powerful China while
retaining the ability to prevail in any conflict]{.underline} with it.
As things are, increasingly overt military confrontation between China
and the United States is likely. These inherent tensions --- along with
those arising from the huge bilateral trade imbalance in favor of China
--- are why the idea of a US-China duopoly like the so-called G-2 is
infeasible even if it were desirable, which it is not. Still, the world
economy is about to see the displacement of the United States from its
20th Century preeminence. China will join the U.S., the EU, and Japan at
the top. India, Brazil, Russia, and others in the G-20 will follow. What
is in prospect is not the hegemony of one or two countries but its
opposite --- a multipolar balance of economic power. China, like Japan,
is, of course, a country with a population vastly larger than it can
prosperously support on its own resource base, large as that is. And
China is late in the search for access to raw materials for its
burgeoning industries. (So is India.) China has a vital interest in the
perpetuation of a global economic order open to trade and investment.
China is now enmeshed in multilateral organizations in which it must
daily demonstrate its dedication to the sovereign equality of nations,
great and small. All this enforces the respect for comity that is the
essence of a \"responsible stakeholder.\" It informed People\'s Bank of
China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan\'s cautious suggestion last spring that it
would be better to manage the dollar down to a sustainable international
role than to have it collapse. But [America is out of practice at
dealing with independent power centers]{.underline}. For the past two
decades the United States has been the undisputed global hegemon. For 40
years before that, it was the indispensable arbiter of the bloc of
nations known as the \"free world.\" [American politicians are
unaccustomed to formulating policy through multilateral consultations
with other nations]{.underline}. [Beijing isn\'t very good at this
either, but seems more open to it than Washington]{.underline}. The
United States will, as always, do what must be done, after it has
exhausted all of the alternatives. But this will take time and cost the
United States further prestige and influence. Meanwhile, [China\'s
global role will grow, especially if Beijing sustains the modesty and
competence for which its diplomats have become known, rather than the
arrogance that some of its domestic officials increasingly
exemplify]{.underline}. The Chinese Communist Party has delivered
prosperity to ordinary Chinese, which is why it enjoys their support.
Eighty-six percent of Chinese think their country is on the right track.
Chinese see proof of the superiority of their political-economy in the
apparent effectiveness of its response to the financial crash and its
aftermath. Their government\'s policies have so far succeeded in
sustaining high rates of economic growth through programs that enhance
long-term economic and intellectual competitiveness. The contrast with
the muddled self-indulgence of Washington\'s response to the crisis, in
particular, is striking. Americans have so far shrunk from the hard
decisions necessary to restore fiscal integrity to their government or
to reverse serious decay in their nation\'s human and physical
infrastructure. The recession has joined foreign wars and continuing
deterioration in relations with the Islamic world as a factor
accelerating American decline. China seems certain to emerge from the
crisis with a much larger and more competitive economy. The generation
born under the single-child policy is coming of age. It is far more
inclined to consumption than its frugal predecessors. A faster
transition to growth driven by domestic consumption than many have
thought possible seems in prospect. China\'s imports are now rising much
more rapidly than its exports. Its balance of payments surplus, huge as
it still is, fell by half in 2009. Continuing economic growth, deepened
ties with Asian neighbors, the progressive internationalization of a
yuan that is rising in value, all promise domestic stability and greater
international stature for China in coming years. The current
self-congratulatory mood in China is therefore entirely understandable.
Yet it masks the underlying weakness of the Chinese political system.
[Government in contemporary China derives its legitimacy almost entirely
from its ability to deliver continued rapid economic
growth]{.underline}. It stands for no credible values, neither trusts
nor is trusted by those it rules, suffers from a high level of
corruption, and has no clear vision for self-improvement. [If America\'s
politics are widely viewed as so venal as to be dysfunctional, the
Chinese system is seen as cynically manipulative and of questionable
legitimacy]{.underline}. Without political reform, China will remain
vulnerable to unrest should the economy falter. If there is no rule of
law in China, Beijing\'s word will be doubted abroad. Despite its
economic successes and growing defense capabilities, China\'s
international influence will remain limited as long as it fails to
evolve an attractive political system. It is not impossible that it may
do so but there is no evidence at present to suggest that it will. A
Chinese perception that the United States is attempting to leverage its
military superiority to keep China down could goad Beijing into efforts
to dislodge America from its position of global dominance. Given the
continuing disparities in national power, the ensuing struggle would be
a long one. The trigger would probably be some incident derived from
U.S. military operations offshore China or from the Taiwan issue, to
which Sino-American relations remain hostage. This is unlikely, but,
unfortunately, it is not impossible to imagine. As I speak, for example,
[China is actively considering how to put effective pressure on the
United States to halt arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline}. China wants
Washington to live up to Ronald Reagan\'s commitment to restrain and
reduce such sales in return for credible pursuit by Beijing of a
peaceful settlement of its differences with Taipei. Sanctions on
selected American companies --- modeled on those the U.S. Congress has
imposed on Chinese companies selling objectionable items to others ---
are apparently among the options before China\'s leaders. In the current
economic climate, any such move by China could trigger a nasty
confrontation and unleash an orgy of American protectionist retaliation
that would likely set off a trade war. I do not consider such a
development likely. If nothing else, however, the [possible consequences
of miscalculation by Beijing or Washington illustrate the global stake
in continuing prudent management of the Sino-American relationship by
both sides]{.underline}. [It is important to see China as it
is]{.underline}, not as we wish or fear it to be. In 1943, President
Franklin Roosevelt declared that China \"has become one of the great
Democracies of the world.\" That was [nonsense]{.underline}, of course.
But so, I believe, [are perceptions of China as an emerging
anti-democratic hegemon]{.underline}. The [more likely prospect is that
China will take its place alongside the United States and others at the
head of a multilateralized system of global governance]{.underline}. In
such an oligarchic world order, China will have great prestige but no
monopoly on power comparable to that which the United States has
recently enjoyed. [America has already lost its global political
hegemony]{.underline}. But, for all the reasons I have mentioned, China
is neither inclined nor capable of succeeding to this role. The
Anglo-American financial model is much tarnished by recent events. But
no alternative to it has yet emerged. It seems certain that whatever
does replace it will be crafted by many hands, only some of which will
be Chinese. American consumption is no longer the sole driver of the
global economy. The China market has come to play an important part in
sustaining world growth. But China is not the only economy that is
rising. [In some areas of global trade and investment, China will be a
dominant factor]{.underline}. In others, it will not be. In the military
arena, even if fiscal limitations force retrenchment, the United States
will, for many years to come, remain the only power with global reach.
[Americans will find it difficult to adjust to a world in which we are
no longer all-powerful in all spheres]{.underline}. But we are a
flexible and resilient people who can and will accommodate change.
Neither we nor the Chinese will cease to pursue our national interests
as we see them. In many instances, these views will more or less
coincide. On such matters, if others agree, there will be global
progress. Where we disagree, we will come under pressure from others to
search for common ground. [Neither of us will be so powerful that we can
ignore]{.underline} such [pressure]{.underline}. In short, the world in
future will be more \"democratic\" and, likely, more muddled than in the
past because many countries, not just the United States or China, will
share power in it. There will be ample opportunity for countries with
trusted relationships with Washington and Beijing to influence how they
participate in global affairs. There will be no hegemon, and there will
be no \"G-2.\"

### 2nc \-\-- CCP Collapse Impact

#### Chinese leadership is vital to [regime legitimacy]{.underline} -- loss of it exacerbates social pressure for CCP collapse

**Edney, 15 --** Kingsley Edney is Lecturer in Politics and
International Relations of China in the School of Politics and
International Studies at the University of Leeds ("Building National
Cohesion and Domestic Legitimacy: A Regime Security Approach to Soft
Power in China" Politics, Volume 35, Issue 3-4 November 2015 Pages
259--272, Wiley)

The need to overcome the security dilemma by reducing the fear its rise
provokes in others is one of China\'s most complex national security
challenges and the most widely cited reason for the country wanting to
increase its soft power. According to Li (2009, p. 31), soft power is
'primarily utilized to refute the "China threat" thesis, facilitate a
better understanding of China\'s domestic socio-economic reality, and
persuade the outside world to accept and support China\'s rise'. Deng
(2009, p. 64) argues that [[in China]{.underline}]{.mark} the concept of
[[soft power]{.underline}]{.mark} 'to a large extent, [[means the
ability to influence others in world politics with the goal of achieving
great power status **without sparking fully fledged traditional power
politics of hostile balancing or war'**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} In his
analysis of the concept\'s role in China\'s rise, Ding (2010, p. 266)
argues that the country\'s soft power strategy is one of reassurance
that helps 'to deal with foreign challenges and create a friendly
international environment'. Rawnsley (2012, p. 126) notes that China\'s
soft power strategy has been prompted by the emergence of a 'China
threat' discourse in the West and therefore China\'s soft power can be
seen as 'not only reactive, but defensive'. Nye also claims that its
soft power strategy is intended 'to make its hard power look less
threatening to its neighbors' and that soft power can help to reduce the
effectiveness of regional coalitions that attempt to balance against
China (Nye, 2011, p. 23; 2013). This kind of national security
perspective helps explain why building soft power has become such an
important task for the CCP. But we need to consider the possibility that
[[domestic concerns over regime security are]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[driving China\'s soft power project.]{.underline}]{.mark}

'Regime security' generally refers to 'the condition where governing
elites are secure from violent challenges to their rule' (Jackson, 2010,
p. 187). In China\'s case, however, the insecurity of the regime is
generated by the possibility not only of violent challenges, but also of
'peaceful evolution' (heping yanbian), which is an extremely seriously
concern for the CCP, particularly following the 'color revolutions' that
have occurred in some post-Soviet states (see Shambaugh, 2008, pp.
88--89). The 'regime' can be defined as 'the small state of persons who
hold the highest offices ... and/or are the elite that effectively
command the machinery, especially the coercive forces, of the state'
(Job, 1992, p. 15). While this article uses the term 'regime security'
rather than 'state security', it should be noted that there is often no
clear dividing line between the two within a 'state-embedded polity'
(Gilley, 2006, p. 501) such as China, where there is significant
penetration of the state by the CCP. Despite China\'s successes in
dealing with many of the common sources of insecurity for developing
states, such as permeability by external actors and susceptibility to
armed conflict (see Ayoob, 1995, p. 15), **[[two important sources of
regime insecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[remain
problematic]{.underline}]{.mark} for the authorities: [[lack of
legitimacy and lack of national cohesion.]{.underline}]{.mark}

For a political authority such as the CCP, legitimacy is determined by
the degree to which it 'holds and exercises political power with
legality, justification and consent from the standpoint of all of its
citizens' (Gilley, 2009, p. 11). In other words, the use of power must
proceed according to rules, these rules are justified by widely shared
beliefs and the actions of those in subordinate positions provide
evidence that they consent to the power relationship (Beetham, 1991, p.
16). There has been a great deal of elite discussion of party legitimacy
in China, particularly since the early 2000s; one study showed that 68
per cent of sampled Chinese journal articles about legitimacy took the
view that the CCP\'s legitimacy was under threat, while 30 per cent
claimed the party faced a legitimacy crisis (Gilley and Holbig, 2009, p.
343). A more recent study found that Chinese intellectuals are more
pessimistic about regime legitimacy in China than their Western
counterparts (Zeng, 2014). For the purpose of this article it is not
necessary to resolve the question of whether or not the CCP currently
faces a legitimacy crisis, however -- only to show that [[the potential
for the party-state to lose its legitimacy is a serious source of
insecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The Fourth Plenum of the 18th Central Committee, held in October 2014,
provides clear evidence that senior party officials are highly concerned
about the legality of CCP power. The Plenum\'s major focus was the need
for the party to 'rule according to the law' (yi fa zhi guo) and pointed
out that 'good law is a prerequisite for good governance' and that for
the party to rule according to the law it must first rule according to
the constitution (Xinhua, 2014). Responsibility for the justification of
party power falls on the Central Propaganda Department, which utilizes a
comprehensive network of institutions to attempt to reproduce the
official discourse justifying CCP rule and suppress any rival discourses
that might challenge it (see Edney, 2014). Lack of consent is also a
problem that requires significant resources to overcome. According to
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, in recent years the annual
number of major protests in China has exceeded 100,000 (Huang, 2012).
While all states use domestic force to some extent (see Buzan, 1983, p.
67), the huge investment of the Chinese authorities in the internal
security apparatus, which in recent years has exceeded even China\'s
military spending (Martina, 2014), demonstrates that the lack of consent
to CCP rule is widespread enough to be a cause for serious concern.

[Soft power is primarily relevant to the enhancement of regime
legitimacy where [a significant component of the moral justification for
maintaining the current system is based on the **regime\'s ability to
improve** ]{.mark}**the [international status]{.mark}** []{.mark}of the
national unit.]{.underline} [The international increase in positive
attraction that is associated with [a rise in soft power makes it easier
for the regime to convince its citizens of the truth of its claim that
the country\'s international status is improving under its
leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}, where 'status' is defined not only in
terms of material capabilities, but also in terms of social recognition.
For the most part, evidence of an increase in international recognition
and attraction could be used to bolster claims that the regime has
successfully improved the country\'s international status, regardless of
whether soft power is a result of attraction to political values,
culture or foreign policies, or whether it is generated by the policies
of the regime or sources within broader society. Some internationally
attractive cultural products can also be the work of dissidents or
relate to aspects of culture or values that the regime would rather
suppress, however, and these sources of attraction are difficult for the
authorities to exploit.

Chinese political elites feel a keen sense of obligation to restore the
country\'s past great power status (Deng, 2008, pp. 8--9) and show its
people that China is globally respected and admired (Zhang, 2012, p.
620). The leadership attempts to appease domestic nationalist audiences
by gaining 'face' for China abroad (Gries, 2004, pp. 120--121) and the
party-state has often publicized statements of support or admiration
from foreign allies to demonstrate China\'s international status and
thereby bolster its moral claim to rule (e.g. Brady, 2003, p. 228). If
there is a broad-based growth in Chinese soft power, these statements
are likely to become more common and more credible as the number and
variety of foreign actors who are attracted to China increases.
Moreover, [international attraction to [China\'s success **in**
]{.mark}**areas such as [economic development]{.mark}** [expands the
number of 'nodes' in networks of 'legitimacy belief', thereby reducing
the marginal cost of persuasion]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and **squeezing
out alternative discourses that might challenge regime
legitimacy**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gerschewski, 2013, pp. 26--27). This
makes it easier for the CCP to claim legitimacy based on its success in
moving China toward the shared goal of national 'rejuvenation'.

Although 'national cohesion' is a concept that is rather nebulous and
difficult to assess, the regular references to 'cohesion' in official
CCP statements indicate that Chinese leaders are worried about it and
seek to improve it (e.g. CCP Central Committee, 2011; 2013). As China
has become a more plural society, generating social consensus (ningju
gongshi) and unifying the people (ningju renxin) have become serious
concerns for the propaganda authorities (Edney, 2014). According to
propaganda chief Liu Yunshan, achieving the 'China dream' of the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation requires cultural cohesion (Xinhua,
2013), while an early article on national cultural security published on
a CCP website argues that [[if a country lacks cohesion -- even if it is
strong in terms of other forms of power -- when it faces
challenges]{.underline}]{.mark} such as a natural disaster or foreign
invasion **[[it will 'collapse at the first blow']{.underline}]{.mark}**
(bu kan yi ji) (Yang, 2006). A lack of national cohesion can be a
persistent problem for weak states that are unable to generate 'a
domestic political and social consensus of sufficient strength to
eliminate the large-scale use of force as a major and continuing element
in the domestic political life of the nation' (Buzan, 1983, p. 67).

Normally soft power refers to a country\'s attractiveness to foreign
constituencies. To consider the possibility that it could enhance
national cohesion, however, it is necessary to apply the concept to the
relationship between domestic constituencies. In this sense, the soft
power of the political, social and cultural core of the polity
encourages domestic interest groups and individuals on the margins to
want the same outcomes, such as stability and national cohesion, as the
authorities at the center. Although this might seem to be a major step
away from the traditional interpretation of soft power, Nye\'s (2011,
pp. 19--20) argument that soft power is a key requirement of an
effective counter-insurgency strategy and that dealing with the threat
of terrorism requires the soft power of an appealing narrative that can
win over mainstream society and prevent terrorists recruiting new
members to their groups, highlights the concept\'s potential
significance for state efforts to respond to domestic sources of
instability. In this case, [[soft power involves enhancing regime
security by making it less likely that domestic adversaries who pose a
threat to national cohesion will be able to obtain material support from
the local population]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[which]{.underline}]{.mark}
then [[makes it easier for the state to deal with the security threat
they pose]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The authorities in Beijing face a range of threats to national
cohesion from peripheral regions, including]{.underline}]{.mark} the
ongoing problem of [[terrorism and insurgent attacks in
Xinjiang]{.underline}]{.mark}, protests and discontent in Tibet,
pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and de facto independence in Taiwan.
In light of these challenges it would not be unreasonable for scholars,
or even the authorities, to interpret 'soft power' as something that
could also be applied to improve regime security by enhancing the
cohesion between the political, social and cultural core of the Chinese
polity and those on the margins. Indeed, in more general terms, Wang and
Lu (2008, p. 427) have pointed out that Chinese interpretations of soft
power include 'the ability to generate compliance in a society by moral
example and persuasion'.

#### Collapse risks Chinese lashout and global nuclear war

**David, 8** -- professor of international relations at Johns Hopkins
(Stephen, [Catastrophic Consequences : Civil Wars and American
Interests,]{.underline} p. 116-121)

Those who see China as a threat to the United States, and to the West
more generally, point to its explosive growth as a source of concern. A
stronger China, they argue, will be a more assertive China, which spells
bad news for the United States, given the range of issues over which the
two countries disagree. A wealthy, militarily strong China may no longer
choose to accept the de facto independence of Taiwan, or it may compete
aggressively to gain dominance over Asia, or replace American influence
among the oil-rich states of the Middle East. Arguments over trade,
human rights, and the environment may take a different tone when America
is dealing with an adversary of equal or even greater strength. Whether
because the United States and China each lead different civilizations,
or simply because the rise of a competing hegemon typically creates
trouble for the existing world leader, the prospect of a continued rise
in China's power unsettles many in America. 2 These fears may indeed be
justified, but continued economic and military growth is not the only
possible future for China. It is at least as likely that China in the
coming years will fall victim to violent instability, bringing to a
screeching halt its seemingly inexorable rise. [Instability may come
from those angry at not sharing the fruits of China\'s newfound
prosperity, growing discrepancies of wealth]{.underline} in a state
founded on principles of equality, mounting corruption by insensitive
officials, incompetent governmental policies, and the absence of
institutions to channel discontent. This anger matters because it is
directed at a government whose \"mandate of heaven\" is increasingly
shaky, since no one---including the leadership elite itself---believes
in the Marxist-Leninist ideology that is trotted out to justify its
rule. All of this takes place in an environment where the regime\'s
ability to monitor and suppress antigovernment activity has never been
lower. [If economic growth can]{.underline} somehow
[continue]{.underline} its upward spiral [producing enough]{.underline}
[benefits to coopt key groups]{.underline}, [China may be able to avoid
nationwide instability]{.underline} in the coming years. However,
[if]{.underline} as seems likely, [the Chinese economy stalls and the
escalating expectations of the Chinese people are no longer met,
widespread civil conflict becomes all but **certain**]{.underline}.
While some American policymakers would greet the prospect of a China
mired in internal conflict with relief, a crippled China presents its
own threats to American interests, [threats]{.underline} that
[are]{.underline} in many ways [more dire than those posed by a rising
China.]{.underline} American and Chinese economies have become closely
inter- twined with huge amounts of American investment in China and even
larger Chinese purchases of American bonds. If domestic unrest
undermines this relationship, any hope of China becoming prosperous
would be dashed, while the American economy would be throw n into
recession ---or worse. [[China]{.mark} is a great power]{.underline}
with a population of 1.3 billion people, bordering on 14 countries. [Its
[collapse would threaten]{.mark} the stability of close [American
allies]{.mark} such as South Korea and Japan, [create]{.mark}
opportunities for [mischief by Russia and North Korea,]{.mark} and
produce a humanitarian catastrophe unprecedented in world
history.]{.underline} [Should [China]{.mark} choose [to stave off
internal unrest]{.mark} through [aggress]{.mark}ive actions against
[Taiwan, prospects for a Sino-American military confrontation become all
too real]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Precisely because China needs
good relations with its neighbors and the United States to continue on
its path of economic growth, there is reason to hope that the Chinese
leadership would not deliberately opt for bellicose policies. If China
is wracked with instability, however, Chinese leaders may not be able to
control what happens within and outside their borders, endangering key
American concerns. Understanding the consequences of a failing China for
the United States re- quires first grasping why a stable China is so
important to American concerns. As will be seen, China plays a central
role in American economic and strategic interests. Why China, despite
its seeming prosperity and progress, may fall victim to civil unrest is
then examined. Unlike Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico, China forces
us to confront what the collapse of a great power would be like. Far
from a welcome occurrence, [the implications]{.underline} of such an
event [are potentially catastrophic for]{.underline} []{.mark}America,
China\'s Asian neighbors, and [the world]{.underline} community.
American Interests in China The United States cares about what happens
in China, because [America\'s prosperity]{.underline} and well-being
[rests on China remaining stable]{.underline}. China is the second
largest trading partner of the United States (after Canada ), a
relationship whose [disruption would be disastrous for both
countries]{.underline}. [The low cost of Chinese exports has kept
inflation down in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, while
delighting consumers with S40 DVD players and S20 digital cameras. These
benefits, while highly visible, pale in comparison to the critical role
played by Chinese purchases of American securities. China holds over one
trillion dollars in foreign reserves, one of the largest holders of such
reserves in the world. Because China exports so much and imports so
little, it accumulates huge amounts of dollars. This would normally
cause the Chinese currency (yuan) to gain in value, thus reducing its
exports and its mammoth reserves. To preserve its critical export
sector, however, China has not allowed the yuan to float freely and
instead has kept its value relatively constant by buying dollars to the
tune of S20 billion per month, ensuring that its reserves will continue
to grow. Approximately 707c of these reserves are in U.S. dollars, with
the great majority in U.S. treasury bonds, widely seen as the most
secure investment one can make, since they are backed in full by the
American government. A major reason why [interest rates]{.underline} in
the United States [have been kept low]{.underline} is [because China
buys]{.underline} so many of these [bonds. These low interest rates are
central to the health of the American economy]{.underline}, fostering
economic expansion and high home prices. The housing market is
especially critical, as it has been the major engine of growth for the
American economy over the past several years, as homeowners (many of
whom have saved little) borrow against the ever rising values of their
houses, stimulating the economy with their robust consumer spending. If
China stops buying American treasury bonds or dramatically slows down
their purchase, American interest rates would need to increase in order
to attract other buyers, making business expansion more costly , houses
much more expensive, and dramatically cutting consumer spending.\' China
displayed its economic clout the day after the Democrats won control
over both houses of Congress in November 2006, when the head of China\'s
central bank declared that the Bank would diversify more of its reserves
into nondollar currencies. This prompted an immediate worldwide sell-off
of American dollars, which dramatically cut the dollar\'s value. If such
a seemingly benign announcement could produce this effect, one shudders
to think of the impact of a major Chinese sell-off of American bonds on
the United States.4 Some have taken solace in the view that Chinese
self-interest would prevent Beijing from acting in ways that would harm
the American economy. If, for example, China halted its purchase of
American securities, China too would suffer as the value of the bonds in
its possession would also decrease. [If China is convulsed with domestic
disorder]{.underline}, however, [[it]{.mark} [would be **unable** to
purchase the American bonds, plunging the U.S. economy into
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}. An unstable China also presents major
strategic concerns for the United States. Since the death of Mao in
1976, China has largely cooperated with the United States on key foreign
policy goals. China has been a prime player in talks with North Korea,
striving to contain the damage done by Pyongyang's development of
nuclear weapons. In part because of China's concerns about its own
Islamic minority, Beijing has worked with Washington after 9/11 to
confront terrorism. China has become a major international player in the
United Nations, contributing more troops to peacekeeping missions around
the world than any other Security Council member. 5 With Washington's
endorsement, China joined the World Trade Organization, where it is
expected to play a major role in lowering tariffs and establishing rules
for free trade that the world (and it) will follow. To be sure, the
United States and China do not agree on everything. The United States is
concerned about China\'s lack of democracy, overlooking of human rights
abuses in Darfur and elsewhere, border disputes with its neighbors,
close ties with Iran, and continuing claims to Taiwan. Nevertheless, in
a world increasingly divided between those fostering terror and
instability and those seeking to maintain order and enhance prosperity,
China clearly belongs in the latter camp, much to America\'s relief. If
China is beset by internal disorder, however, there is no telling what
kind of regime might emerge in its wake. The brutal civil war in China
in the late 1940s gave birth to an equally brutal government that made
life miserable for its neighbors and America for decades. [[A]{.mark}
twenty-first-century [civil war could]{.mark} well [bring about]{.mark}
the emergence of [a hostile, expansionist China]{.mark} that, armed
[with **nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} and a strong
economy, [posed [a]{.mark}n even greater [threat to]{.mark}]{.underline}
American interests and [[world stability]{.underline}]{.mark} than its
Maoist predecessor. [A strong China is necessary to preserve Asian
stability]{.underline}, a vital interest of the United States. The
prosperity of Asian nations is directly linked to the surging Chinese
economy. In the 1990s, Asian nations produced goods largely for
non-Asian countries, particularly the United States. By 2005, more than
half of all regional exports were to other states in the region, with
China the most likely destination. China is the number one trading
partner of such Asian powerhouses as South Korea and Japan, both of
which now provide more direct investment to China (over S5 billion per y
ear) than even the United States.6 Moreover, China has emerged as the
major player in Asian multilateral organizations, including the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization (SCO), and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
(APEC). None of these organizations could meet their goals of fostering
economic and political interdependence without the active cooperation of
China. [Insofar as economic interdependence and international
institutions promote peace and security[,]{.mark} the continued economic
growth and stability of China is essential for Asia]{.underline}. The
importance of a stable China to American strategic interests is best
seen by considering what might happen [if China unraveled]{.underline}.
One of the first consequences would be millions of refugees pouring from
China's borders, unsettling its neighbors. [The stability of key
American allies such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan would be severely
tested as they try to cope with]{.underline} this massive human flow
along with [the economic shockwaves of China\'s
dissolution]{.underline}. Nor would the United States be immune, as mam
Chinese may take advantage of corrupt officials or professional human
smugglers (\"snakeheads\') to make their way to America\'s shores.
[[North Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}, unpredictable under normal
circumstances, [[may flex its military muscle]{.underline}]{.mark} along
its borders with China and South Korea, [**[with dreadful
results]{.underline}**. E[thnic minorities in]{.underline}]{.mark}
[provinces such as [Tibet and Xinjiang might]{.mark} seize the moment to
[attempt to break away]{.mark}]{.underline} from Beijing\'s domination,
fostering even greater instability. [[China\'s control of
its]{.underline}]{.mark} more than 200 **[[nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**, usually very secure, [[may be
compromised, with the arms]{.underline}]{.mark} eventually [[falling
into unknown hands]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[territorial
disputes]{.underline}]{.mark} that China has [[with
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, Vietnam, [[India, and others could]{.mark}
well [degenerate into **armed warfare**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[as China loses control over its own military
forces]{.underline} and its neighbors seek to take advantage of its
internal strife. As Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping remarked (following the
1989 Tiananmen demonstrations), the collapse of Chinese rule would have
terrible effects that would go far beyond China\'s borders: \"And if a
civil war broke out, with blood flowing like a river, what \'human
rights\' would there be? If civil war broke out in China, with each
faction dominating a region, production declining, transportation
disrupted and not millions or tens of millions but hundreds of millions
of refugees fleeing the country, it is the Asia-Pacific region, which is
at present the most promising in the world, that would be the first
affected. And that would lead to disaster on a world scale.\"9 While
Deng may have had reason to exaggerate the effects of the toppling of
the Chinese regime, his concerns ring true. [American
relations]{.underline} with China [would be severely damaged in the wake
of Chinese unrest.]{.underline} [The Chinese regime might single out the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [as an enemy in order to stifle
civil strife by fostering anti-American nationalism]{.underline}. [If
China violently suppressed protests]{.underline}, as it did during the
1989 Tiananmen demonstrations, the American [Congress might retaliate
with economic sanctions, further escalating tensions]{.underline}
between China and the United States. Especially if China takes actions
against groups favored by the United States, such as Chi- nese
Christians, the American leadership is likely to react harshly against
Beijing. Chinese leaders already worry about the United States
exploiting internal unrest to remove them from power. Actual American
support of insurgent groups even if it is confined to expressions of
sympathy, could be taken as a sign that Washington had joined with the
rebels, throwing Sino-American relations into crisis. [China would very
quickly turn from an erstwhile ally into a superpower
adversary]{.underline}. The deterioration of the American relationship
with China would be especially dangerous regarding Taiwan. Under the
best of circumstances, Taiwan presents a flash point in the
Chinese-American relationship. China\'s claims that Taiwan is a renegade
province belonging to the People\'s Republic fly in the face of
America\'s commitment to protect Taiwan, a democratic and prosperous
ally. [So long as Taiwan does not declare its independence, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and China can agree to
disagree about Taiwan\'s future, but should internal unrest engulf
China, this uneasy and informal accommodation could
unravel]{.underline}. [If China falls victim to widespread instability,
the pressure to act against Taiwan would be enormous]{.underline}. [It
would give China the excuse to impose martial law,]{.underline}
improving its abilities to suppress any budding revolt. China\'s claims
to Taiwan enjoy near unanimous approval among the Chinese people.
[Acting against Taiwan would enable the Chinese leadership to fan the
flames of nationalism]{.underline}, one of the few means at its disposal
to rally support for an otherwise illegitimate regime.\" [A
Sino-Taiwanese confrontation could also come about inadvertently if the
Chinese leadership decided to provoke a crisis over Taiwan only to find
itself at war as popular emotions prevented a peaceful
resolutio]{.underline}n of the crisis. If a Taiwanese leader decided to
exploit Chinese unrest by declaring independence, the Chinese government
might have no choice but to launch an attack. As the political scientist
Susan Shirk argues, no Chinese regime can stand aside and allow Taiwan
to announce its independence without going to war if it expects to
survive in power.12 Whether through miscalculation or brinksmanship,
[war with Taiwan producing a Sino-American confrontation could well be
the unintended out- come of Chinese civil conflict]{.underline}. China
is well prepared to take forceful action against Taiwan if it decides to
do so. China has been constantly upgrading its air and sea capabilities
for a possible invasion across the Straits of Taiwan. 13 If China
chooses not to invade, it could launch the hundreds of ballistic
missiles deployed on its coast against Taiwan or it could blockade its
two principal ports. Given that Taiwan is critically dependent on
foreign trade (75% of its GDP) and imports of fuel for energy
consumption (95% of its energy needs come from outside the country),
either of these actions would cripple the island state. 14 It is
difficult to see the United States remaining indifferent to a brutal
assault against one of its allies. Perhaps most worrisome, we simply do
not know all of the effects that the collapse of China would bring. The
prospect of civil unrest in China threatens an existing great power
poised perhaps to become the major power of the twenty-first century.
[The impact of civil conflict in China cannot be isolated to one or a
handful of consequences. [As seen in the French
Revolution]{.mark}]{.underline} of 1789-- 1799 [[and the Russian Civil
War]{.underline}]{.mark} of 1918-- 1920, [[great powers do not suffer
civil violence quietly, or alone]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Given
China's]{.mark} central role in the world economy]{.underline}, enormous
population, [[nuclear arsenal]{.underline}]{.mark}, and growing
international influence, [[the unraveling of China]{.mark} cannot help
but [be **shattering for the world**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Change can be
beneficial, and the weakening of a prospective superpower competitor
would be celebrated in some American quarters. Nevertheless, an
uncontrolled, cataclysmic transformation in China would threaten
American interests as much as, if not more than, the purposeful designs
of Maoist China a generation ago.

[Scholars have offered conflicting assessments about the trajectory of
American power]{.underline}. Some contend that [China's rise is
inexorable and that the United States is already in
decline]{.underline}. "There is [abundant evidence that American global
hegemony is steadily eroding]{.underline}," Martin Jacques observes,
adding, "[The rise of China will change the world in the most profound
ways]{.underline}." 18 Arvind Subramanian concludes, "The economic
dominance of China relative to the United States" is "imminent" and will
be "broad-based." 19 Others argue that China's ascendance is fragile and
that America's exceptional features will insulate it from decline.
"China is rising, but it is not catching up," Michael Beckley maintains,
in large part because "trends favor continued U.S. dominance." 20 Joseph
Nye similarly argues, "China is nowhere near close to the United
States," warning that "the greatest danger we have is overestimating
China." 21 Politicians echo this skepticism. In a 2014 speech at West
Point, President Barack Obama declared, "America has rarely been
stronger relative to the rest of the world. Those who argue
otherwise---who suggest that America is in decline, or has seen its
global leadership slip away---are either misreading history or engaged
in partisan politics." 22 [There are many complex issues bound up in
this debate]{.underline}. Scholars differ on what metrics to use, what
timeframes to examine, and what comparisons to make. We follow the
method that yielded the most commonsense cases: lasting ordinal
transitions involving relative shares of great power gross domestic
product (GDP). Using this approach, the United States is on pace to
enter acute relative decline sometime in the next decade. 23 To be
perfectly clear, this prediction depends on a number of factors that are
hard to predict. Extrapolating out from present trends is notoriously
unreliable, and much depends on the baseline year one chooses to begin
with. There will be shocks and surprises, and it is impossible to know
their frequency, magnitude, or direction. Yet using our terminology,
[the United States is likely to face a decline that is small or medium
in magnitude]{.underline}. This is good news for the United States and
for China, since it affords both powers the time and space to manage the
impending transition. It deserves emphasis that China is no
world-beater, the United States is no weakling, and American decline is
likely modest. As always, much depends on the measures used. Power is an
intricate concept and sensitive to context. Every measure of power has
its drawbacks, and we already detailed many of the fl aws of using GDP
in chapter 3. We agree that GDP trends mask a great deal of nuance,
cross-national GDP fi gures are imprecise, and China's fi gures are more
suspect than most. Yet GDP is determinate and correlates with a number
of compelling metrics, many of which suggest that [China is indisputably
gaining ground on the United States]{.underline}. [Over the past decade,
the United States has experienced a decline in global share of high
technology exports, trademark applications, market capitalizations of
its publicly traded companies, and renewable energy
production]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [China has gained relative to the
United States in terms of patent applications, high technology exports,
and information and communication technology service
exports]{.underline}. 24 Even when it comes to [GDP]{.underline} per
capita, which many claim provides "[a much more robust indicator of
national power]{.underline}," China is gaining ground. 25 [China's GDP
per capita has tripled over the past decade]{.underline}, and the U.S.
advantage has declined as a result. Naturally, these are not the only
indicators one could point to, and economic measures may lose traction
on the political consequences of China's rise. Yet experts come to
similar conclusions: Thomas [Christensen finds China's rise very
real]{.underline}, though the United States retains a commanding lead on
many measures, and Jonathan [Kirshner sees American economic advantages
fading]{.underline}. 26 Even U.S. policymakers, who reject the term
decline, nevertheless acknowledge that the distribution of international
power is shifting. In his West Point speech, President Obama observed,
"The world is changing with accelerating speed. This presents new
opportunities, but also new dangers." 27 Former Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton conceded, "The Asia-Pacific has become a key driver of
global politics. . . . Harnessing Asia's growth and dynamism is central
to American economic and strategic interests." 28 Whether one prefers
the term "rising power" or "emerging power," the implication is the
same: the geopolitical landscape is shifting, and U.S. policymakers must
plan accordingly.

Research and development ([R&D]{.underline}) [statistics illustrate this
ambition]{.underline}. Supported by higher economic growth, [[China
is]{.underline}]{.mark} actually [[expected to take global R&D
leadership]{.mark} this year]{.underline}, and [outspend the US for the
very first time]{.underline}.^1^ [[China]{.mark} now [leads the pack in
many areas]{.mark}, such as artificial intelligence ([AI]{.mark}),
[5G]{.mark} telecommunication networks, ultra-high voltage
[electricity]{.mark} networks or high-speed rail]{.underline}. While
China's technology push is hardly news, rising tensions with the West,
in particular with the US, have put it under the spotlight While China's
technology push is hardly news, [[rising tensions]{.mark} with the West,
in particular with the US, have [put it under the
spotlight]{.mark}]{.underline}. Over the past few years, [[Chinese
officials have increased their emphasis on]{.mark} the need to become
less dependent on foreign technology]{.underline}. Some have even
theorized a so-called '[[technology decoupling']{.underline}]{.mark},
advocating self-sufficiency in a number of critical industries. However,
one key consideration to bear in mind is that China's technology push
amid rising tensions with the US does not necessarily herald a full
economic decoupling, nor an era of deglobalization, as some have
argued.^2^ For now, US restrictions on exports to China issued in 2020
remain essentially focused on a few select technologies, where non-US
alternatives are difficult to find. Meanwhile[, China\'s main policy
goal remains to improve the country's manufacturing
capability]{.underline} to produce higher value-added goods and
services, [and keep the economic growth engine roaring]{.underline}.
Policy makers acknowledge that this will be impossible without importing
advanced technologies from the US, Europe, Japan, or South Korea. Figure

ambitions were formally articulated in 2015]{.mark}]{.underline} with

blueprint aiming to modernize further the country's industrial base.
[MIC 2025 [identifies ten strategic sectors]{.mark}, including aerospace
equipment, medical devices, or high-tech ships, in which China intends
to excel and secure a leading position]{.underline}. Focus on a few
selected technologies Even under the MIC 2025 umbrella, the designated
ten core industries are clearly not all being pursued with the same
intensity. In recent years[, [China has been prioritizing]{.mark}
efforts in a small number of [emerging technologies]{.mark}, including
AI, semiconductors, robotics, and new energy vehicles]{.underline}
(NEVs), ^3^ with colossal efforts being deployed from a human and a
financial perspective. Figure 2: Top 20 countries in AI paper output

China has achieved the most spectacular results and secured a clear
leading position at global level.^4^ The Chinese AI-related ecosystem

gigantic market size which provided a unique opportunity to assemble
large datasets, and a long-standing friendly policy environment[. [AI

cohort, by far, of AI professionals, with over 12,000 AI jobs in 2019,
versus roughly 7,500 for the US.^5^ Another area where strong progress
has been made NEVs. China has the world's largest fleet of NEVs in
circulation, far ahead of Europe and the US, as well as the world's
largest battery-charging network. And although the country's NEV car
registrations were overtaken by European ones last year, it remains one
of the most dynamic markets, largely dominated by local manufacturers.

This is especially the case for electric battery production, where the
largest Chinese manufacturers have emerged as global leaders along with
their South Korean and Japanese competitors. Altogether, China accounts
for over 70% of global battery cell production capacity. ^6^ [Three
investment themes China's technology push is offering
opportunities]{.underline} in many industries, but finding these is not
always straightforward. [Not all initiatives have lived up to
expectations]{.underline}, so far, and political will does not warrant
success. Yet [that does not mean opportunities in areas where results
have been mixed are entirely absent]{.underline}, nor that policy
success will necessarily lead to attractive returns for investors. From
this perspective, we have identified three major investment themes worth
considering: the relentless rise of NEVs, the advent of 'industry 4.0'
in China, and an increased focus on the localization of supply chains.
Given the bright prospects these three trends offer, we believe this is
where some of the most interesting opportunities are to be found.

Central Intelligence Agency Director Bill Burns announced in October
that the agency is establishing two new major "mission centers," one
focusing on China and the other on frontier technologies. This action
reflects his judgment that China is the "most important geopolitical
threat we face in the 21st century" and that [the "[main arena for
competition and rivalry]{.mark}" between China and the U.S. [will be
advanced technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}. The question Americans
should be asking is: [Could [China win the technology
race]{.mark}]{.underline}? [A new report on the "Great Technological
Rivalry" from Harvard's Belfer Center answers: Yes]{.underline}. The
report isn't alarmist but nonetheless concludes that [[China has made
such extraordinary leaps]{.mark} that it is now a full-spectrum peer
competitor]{.underline}. [In each of the foundational technologies of
the 21st century---artificial intelligence, semiconductors, 5G wireless,
quantum information science, biotechnology and green energy---[China
could soon be the global leader]{.mark}]{.underline}. In some areas, it
is already No. 1. \[graphic ommited\] Last year [China [produced 50% of
the world's computers]{.mark} and mobile phones]{.underline}; the U.S.
produced only 6%. China produces 70 solar panels for each one produced
in the U.S., sells four times the number of electric vehicles, and has
nine times as many 5G base stations, with network speeds five times as
fast as American equivalents. In the advanced technology likely to have
the greatest effect on economics and security in the coming
decade---artificial intelligence---China is ahead of the U.S. in crucial
areas. A spring 2021 report from the National Security Commission on AI
warned that [China is [poised to overtake the U.S. as the global leader
in AI by 2030]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} U.S.-born students are
earning roughly as many doctorates each year in AI-related fields as in
1990, while China is on track to graduate twice as many science,
technology engineering and mathematics Ph.D.s as the U.S. by 2025. The
Harvard report adds that [China now [clearly tops the U.S. in practical
AI applications]{.mark}, including facial recognition, voice recognition
and fintech]{.underline}. The [U.S. still has a dominant position in the
semiconductor industry, which it has held for almost half a century. But
[China may soon catch up in]{.mark} two important arenas: [semiconductor
fabrication and chip design]{.mark}]{.underline}. China's production of
semiconductors has surpassed America's, with its share of global
production rising to 15% from less than 1% in 1990, while the U.S. share
has fallen from 37% to 12%. In 5G, the Pentagon's Defense Innovation
Board reports that [China is [on track to replicate the economic and
military advantages]{.mark} America gained from being the global leader
in 4G]{.underline}. China has installed 950,000 base stations to
America's 100,000. By the end of last year, 150 million Chinese were
using 5G mobile phones with average speeds of 300 megabits a second,
while only six million Americans had access to 5G with speeds of 60
megabits a second. America's 5G service providers have put more focus on
advertising their capabilities than on building infrastructure. [The
Chinese Communist Party has made no secret of its ambitions: [China
intends to become the global leader in the technologies]{.mark} that
will shape the decades ahead]{.underline}. The party's 2013 economic
reform plan highlighted technological innovation as the way to avoid the
trap of getting stuck as a middle-income country. The celebrated "Made
in China 2025" program aims to dominate domestic production of 10
emerging technologies, including 5G, AI and electric vehicles. [China
also plans to extend its lead in robotics to sustain its position as the
manufacturing workshop of the world]{.underline}. In May,
[Xi]{.underline} Jinping [clearly stated his judgment that
"[technological innovation has become the main battleground of the
global playing field]{.mark}]{.underline}, and competition for tech
dominance will grow unprecedentedly fierce." It is striking how
successful China has been in meeting its ambitious technology targets.
In sum, although the U.S. remains the global leader in many important
races, including aeronautics, medicine and nanotechnology, China has
emerged as a serious competitor. Fortunately, Americans are beginning to
wake up to this reality. In June the Senate passed the Innovation and
Competition Act with bipartisan support, authorizing \$250 billion of
investment in science and technology over the next five years.
Unfortunately, that legislation has stalled in the House and faces an
uncertain future as part of the annual defense bill. More recent
congressional spending proposals, such as the \$1.2 trillion
infrastructure bill and the \$1.7 trillion social-spending package, have
included investments in research and development in areas like green
technologies and energy storage. While these investments are greatly
needed, it will take more attention and investment in strategic
technologies to compete with China. Unless the U.S. can organize a
national response analogous to the mobilization that created the
technologies that won World War II, [China could soon dominate the
technologies of the future and the opportunities they will
create]{.underline}.

American primacists have advanced a number of clever but unconvincing
arguments in an attempt to downplay the significance of the ongoing
economic power shift from America to China. For example, [some
[primacists]{.mark} [assert]{.mark} that per capita GDP is a better
yardstick of national power than aggregate GDP; that newly developed
metrics of national power have diminished the importance of GDP as a
measure of a state's economic power; that [China is far behind the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [in advanced tech]{.mark}nology; and that
China is incapable of doing innovation.35]{.underline} This last claim
is ubiquitous among primacists.36 It is, however, undermined by recent
developments. For example, in September 2016 China began operating the
world's largest radio telescope, which is intended to project China's
ambitions deep into the universe, and bring back the kind of dramatic
discoveries that win honours such as Nobel Prizes.37 [[In August]{.mark}
2016 [China launched the]{.mark} world's [first quantum
satellite,]{.mark} which could lead 'to new, completely different
methods for transmitting information']{.underline}.38 In another example
of how [[China]{.mark} is [catching up]{.mark} with the United States
[in innovation]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nology, in June 2016 a
Chinese computer]{.underline} (using made-in-China microprocessors)
topped the ranking of the world's fastest supercomputers.39 [[In]{.mark}
July [2017]{.mark} [China's State Council announced]{.mark} an ambitious
[plan to sprint to the front of the]{.mark} [pack in]{.mark} artificial
intelligence ([AI]{.mark}), including both military and civilian
applications]{.underline}.40 Indeed, The Economist recently observed
that already '[[China could]{.mark} [be]{.mark} a close second to
America---and **perhaps even [ahead of it]{.mark}**---in some areas of
AI']{.underline}.41 And China is moving to the forefront in green
technologies (solar panels and wind-generated power) and in electric
cars.42

**[In all five sectors]{.underline}**, as I demonstrate below,
[**China** **is**]{.underline} already **[ahead]{.underline}**.

[Let's start with AI]{.underline}. As the NCSC researchers noted,
[China]{.underline} already [possesses]{.underline} "[the might, talent,
and ambition" to win the AI arms race]{.underline}.

Nicolas Chaillan, who left his role as the U.S. Air Force's first chief
software officer in October 2021, [certainly
agrees](https://gizmodo.com/former-senior-pentagon-official-says-china-is-kicking-o-1847838903).
Frustrated by the U.S. military's lack of digital progress,
he [[believes that **China** has **already**
**won**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/time-say-goodbye-nicolas-m-chaillan/?src=aff-lilpar&veh=aff_src.aff-lilpar_c.partners_pkw.10078_plc.Skimbit%20Ltd._pcrid.449670_learning&trk=aff_src.aff-lilpar_c.partners_pkw.10078_plc.Skimbit%20Ltd._pcrid.449670_learning&clickid=VkzXlU2OMxyIUh4UCrRRW3yQUkBXJvTTg3EPws0&mcid=6851962469594763264&irgwc=1) the
**AI race**, blaming
"stale" [technology](https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-technology) and
bureaucratic red tape]{.underline} [for the lack of innovation in the
United States.]{.underline}

In an interview with Verdict, Michael Orme, senior analyst at GlobalData
and a China specialist, echoed Chaillan's concerns. Orme [[suggested
that
**Beijing**](https://www.verdict.co.uk/pentagon-officers-says-china-is-overtaking-the-us-on-ai-o/) has
already "**leveraged** its **wealth of data and** the **surveillance**
state **to gain AI supremacy."**]{.underline}

The two men appear to be correct. In 2021, China [overtook the United
States](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Datawatch/China-overtakes-US-in-AI-research) in
AI journal citations. And for those who say citations aren't everything,
I agree. However, citations shouldn't be overlooked.

Then [there's quantum development]{.underline}, [an area China is [set
to
dominate](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2282961-china-beats-google-to-claim-the-worlds-most-powerful-quantum-computer/)]{.underline}.
If China does achieve quantum supremacy, which looks increasingly
likely, then [the CCP will have the power]{.underline} [to [inflict
further
damage](https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/94493-china-has-stolen-the-personal-data-of-80-of-american-adults) on
U.S. national security]{.underline}. In July 2021, a Chinese research
team built the world's most powerful quantum computer. In this game of
high-tech chess, their creation, which [surpassed Google's 2019
creation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5), gives
China the "[quantum
advantage](https://cosmosmagazine.com/science/china-demonstrates-most-powerful-quantum-computer/)."
More worryingly, with such advances, [**China** **is looking set** **to
create the world's first [unhackable internet communications
network](https://futurism.com/chinas-new-quantum-communication-network-will-be-unhackable).**]{.underline}

Furthermore, according to a report [published by Booz
Allen](https://www.boozallen.com/expertise/analytics/quantum-computing/chinese-cyber-threats-in-the-quantum-era.html),
a global leader in cyber solutions, [**China's quantum developments**
**will** "eventually **undermine** all popular current **public-key
encryption methods**, and plausibly boost the speed and power of
artificial intelligence."]{.underline}

The Booz Allen researchers said that by the end of the decade, "Chinese
threat groups will likely collect data that enables quantum simulators
to discover new economically valuable materials, pharmaceuticals, and
chemicals."

"Most of quantum computing's potential lies more than a decade in the
future---but risk management must start now," the researchers said.

The United States, the CCP's No. 1 enemy, should take note.

[The third key sector is biotechnology]{.underline}. As a report
published by [Insider
states](https://www.businessinsider.com/chinas-biotech-surge-history-implications-and-future-2021-9),
[Chinese biotech companies]{.underline} [are among the most powerful in
the world]{.underline}. [The Chinese biotech industry]{.underline}
**[has a global footprint stretching
from [Uganda](https://www.africanews.com/2020/12/09/uganda-authorizes-chinese-nationals-to-import-covid-19-vaccine-for-own-use/) to
the United States]{.underline}**. In August 2021, the Chinese
company [BeiGene announced
plans](https://www.biospace.com/article/beigene-builds-new-site-in-new-jersey-expects-to-hire-hundreds-morphosys-continues-boston-expansion/#:~:text=China%2Dbased%20BeiGene%20is%20building,for%20different%20kinds%20of%20cancer.) to
build a 42-acre research and development center in New Jersey.

Rather alarmingly, according to a [New York Times
report](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/22/us/politics/china-genetic-data-collection.html),
[the **Chinese** **regime** **is** currently]{.underline} "[**collecting
medical, health and genetic data around the world**,"]{.underline} using
"the intersection of technology and genetic and biological research as
an area of competition and espionage."

[China]{.underline} has [repeatedly]{.underline} [[emphasized the
importance](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2019/08/chinas-military-pursuing-biotech/159167/) of
biology]{.underline} [in future warfare]{.underline}. According [to He
Fuchu](https://web.archive.org/web/20190813042422/http:/www.81.cn/jwgz/2015-10/06/content_6709533.htm),
a military medical scientist, the Chinese are busy working on "new
brain-control weapons and equipment that interfere with and control
human consciousness," all in the hope of making "unmanned warfare
possible."

[The fourth key sector involves semiconductors.]{.underline} For the
uninitiated, without semiconductors, using smartphones, laptops, washing
machines, and refrigerators simply [wouldn't be
possible](https://www.hitachi-hightech.com/global/products/device/semiconductor/life.html#:~:text=CPUs%20that%20operate%20personal%20computers,LED%20bulbs%20also%20use%20semiconductors.&text=In%20this%20way%2C%20semiconductors%20help%20us%20to%20live%20comfortable%20lives.).
Essentially, [semiconductors]{.underline} [are the [brains of electronic
devices](https://www.semiconductors.org/semiconductors-101/what-is-a-semiconductor/)]{.underline}.
Until recently, the United States fully controlled the supply of these
"brains."

Today, however, **[China is on the ascendancy.]{.underline}** Last year
alone, **[the number of Chinese semiconductor
firms [tripled](https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3136660/new-chinese-semiconductor-firms-have-tripled-2021-beijing-and)]{.underline}**.
The metaverse, the next step in the evolution of the internet,
will [rely heavily on
semiconductors](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/08/10/what-is-the-metaverse/),
hence China's desire to become a [dominant
force](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202111/1238160.shtml).

[The final sector involves autonomous systems]{.underline}, [such as
self-driving cars and surveillance drones]{.underline}. [**Baidu**,
China's equivalent to Google,]{.underline} **[is [leading the
self-driving
race](https://techwireasia.com/2021/08/baidu-leads-the-self-driving-race-with-an-ai-packed-robocar/)]{.underline}**.
Last year, the Chinese company launched the [first-ever paid driverless
taxi
service](https://techwireasia.com/2021/05/baidu-rolls-out-chinas-first-paid-driverless-taxi-service/).

[**In the United States**, meanwhile]{.underline}, [**self-driving
vehicles [are decades
away](https://www.wsj.com/articles/self-driving-cars-could-be-decades-away-no-matter-what-elon-musk-said-11622865615)** from
becoming a reality]{.underline}. China is also [leading the
way](https://supchina.com/2021/06/18/all-the-drone-companies-in-china-a-guide-to-the-22-top-players-in-the-chinese-uav-industry/) in
the manufacturing and sales of surveillance drones; the United States is
one of [its biggest
customers](https://www.axios.com/federal-law-enforcement-china-drone-4b33aca2-b6f5-43d0-8d36-be1d447af1a0.html).
If this isn't worrying enough, China recently created an autonomous
weapon that, [according to
reports](https://futurism.com/the-byte/china-weapon-satellites-explode),
"uses explosives to destroy enemy satellites." As tensions heat up
between China and the United States, one shouldn't be surprised if U.S.
satellites become a primary target.

[While a [slow-burning movement to rein in the U.S. tech industry plods
through a gridlocked Congress]{.mark} and various agencies,
[China]{.mark}'s one-party government [is acting
swiftly]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [and harshly]{.underline} --- [[to rein
in its own tech titans]{.underline}]{.mark}. This month alone, [the
country has [instituted sweeping new protections]{.mark} for gig
workers]{.underline}; [imposed new interoperability requirements for
online platforms; driven out cryptocurrency exchanges; barred its
leading ride-hailing app from app stores; and essentially banned the
entire industry of for-profit online tutoring services]{.underline}.
Antitrust investigations and penalties have already targeted digital
giants Alibaba and Tencent, among others, in recent months. The shakeout
continued Tuesday as Tencent's WeChat, China's dominant social and
messaging platform, stopped registering new users, saying it needs to
upgrade certain security systems to comply with unspecified "laws and
regulations." The company expects registrations to resume in early
August. The WeChat news comes a day after Chinese regulators issued
tough new worker protection rules for food delivery services, including
industry leader Meituan, and weeks after ride-hailing giant Didi was
removed from app stores as part of a cybersecurity investigation, widely
viewed as punishment for the company going public in the United States.
The government's hard line has sent Chinese tech stocks plummeting and
rippled across the financial world. Shares of Chinese companies listed
in the United States this week saw their steepest two-day drop since the
2008 financial crisis, according to BBC News. [Some observers see the
moves as part of a political power play against an industry that has
grown too wealthy, powerful and independent for the comfort of President
Xi Jinping's regime]{.underline}. In a Substack newsletter, economics
commentator Noah Smith argued that it **[[represents a broader shift in
national priorities]{.mark} from consumer-facing online platforms and
apps [to]{.mark} harder, more [cutting-edge tech, such as artificial
intelligence and chip-making, that supports the country's geopolitical
objectives]{.mark}]{.underline}**. There may be truth to both views. But
there's another way of looking at these developments, in which China's
goals for its tech industry are not so different from those of its
Western counterparts. It just has fewer checks and restraints on the use
of state power to achieve them. \[graphic omitted\] Rui Ma, an investor
and analyst of China's tech industry and founder of Tech Buzz China[,
[the country isn't "smashing its tech industry]{.mark},"]{.underline} as
Smith put it. Rather, [the crackdown shows that [China's government
harbors many of the same concerns as tech critics in the United
States]{.mark}]{.underline} and the European Union, and is intent on
constructing the ground rules for an ever more digital economy.
Protections for gig workers in China, for example, followed years of
reports of such workers being overworked, underpaid and abused by
unaccountable management algorithms. [The tightening of data security
laws]{.underline}, focusing on firms with a significant presence outside
China, [mirrors U.S. fears about data privacy and spying]{.underline},
notably by Chinese firms such as Huawei and ByteDance. The antitrust
push draws on the arguments advanced by U.S. Federal Trade Commission
Chair Lina Khan and others that dominant digital platforms lend
themselves to new forms of monopolization and anticompetitive behavior.
"The headlines are virtually the same as what I read in the U.S.," Rui
said. One big difference: [[Tech regulation in China faces fewer
political hurdles]{.mark} than it does in the United
States]{.underline}, where a gridlocked two-party Congress and intense
lobbying by Silicon Valley firms have so far thwarted meaningful
legislation[. Despite broad agreement that tech giants are too powerful,
both major [U.S. parties are divided on how to address issues of
competition]{.mark}]{.underline}, consumer protection and online speech.
Of course, China's approach comes with its own big downsides: The lack
of democratic process and transparent debate means its regulations can
come across as arbitrary, vindictive and unpredictable --- traits that
tend to spook investors and risk chilling innovation. [There is one
argument against [U.S. regulation]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, **[that
might be [crumbling before our eyes]{.mark}]{.underline}**: the specter
of global domination by an unfettered Chinese Internet sector. In
congressional hearings and media interviews, [U.S. tech executives have
repeatedly warned that onerous regulations, including new antitrust and
privacy laws, would hamper their ability to compete with China's tech
gladiators on the world stage]{.underline}. The implication, often
unspoken but sometimes explicit, was that **[[China understood that
having powerful tech giants was in its national interest]{.mark}, and
wouldn't dare sacrifice that power in the name of values such as
privacy, competition or consumer protection]{.underline}**. [China does
see value in its tech giants competing globally]{.underline}, Rui said,
and the current regulatory wave is not a sign that it wants to destroy
the industry's ambitions abroad. **[But it does [signal an abrupt end to
the country's hands-off approach to the tech sector]{.mark}, and
demonstrates a new willingness to impose its own
priorities]{.underline}** --- even at the cost of their profitability
and international standing. [There's been a narrative for years that the
United States, the E.U. and China are competing in global "races" in
realms such as artificial intelligence]{.underline}; Rui suggests [China
sees itself as racing to establish a world-class regulatory regime to
guide the sector's future]{.underline}. "China wants to be world-leading
in regulations," Rui said. "They don't just want to follow the E.U. and
the U.S." From its censorship of the Internet to its surveillance of
vulnerable groups, many aspects of the Chinese government's approach to
are cautionary tales for the West. But its aggressive stance toward
anticompetitive practices, speculative and carbon-intensive
cryptocurrencies, and gig worker exploitation aren't necessarily the
destructive moves they might seem to U.S. observers and investors. On
the contrary, [they may be [laying the foundation for a more sustainable
and vibrant Chinese Internet sector]{.mark} in the decades to
come]{.underline}.

When Jack Ma, the billionaire founder of internet giant Alibaba, told
China's financial elites on October 24, 2020 that their incompetence had
created a severely underdeveloped financial system and insinuated that
his fintech may be the cure, his words marked the moment when [[Beijing
shifted its relations to big tech giants from toleration to
confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark}. Ma was perhaps unaware that the same
day saw [the [launch of "Operation Cyber Sword,"]{.mark} a wide-ranging
campaign involving 14 ministries and agencies aimed at [reigning in
China's tech sector]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The regulatory actors were
given six tasks: regulating live-commerce platforms, cracking down on
unfair competition in online markets, strengthening the supervision of
internet advertising, centralizing control of online sales, and ending
illegal animal and plant trade on e-commerce platforms]{.underline}.
What has followed over the ensuing 12 months is an unprecedented and
ongoing regulatory onslaught. [Hundreds of companies have been fined
north of \$3 billion, apps have been taken off stores, and Jack
Ma]{.underline} -- until then China's richest man -- i[nexplicably went
missing for three months]{.underline}. **[[The Chinese government was
sending a message]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As the People's Daily put it:
"There was never such as thing as Ma's era, just an era that Ma happened
to live in." China's Cyber Sword is being wielded not just at individual
companies or apps but at entire industries and ecosystems. A whole range
of antitrust guidelines and rules have been introduced and applied to
e-commerce platforms, social media providers, and live-streaming
services. [Behind the regulatory onslaught is [a paradigmic
shift]{.mark}, the result of long-term preparation by the Chinese
Communist Party's]{.underline} (CCP) leader Xi Jinping. Xi [[declared
2021 to be the beginning of the "New Development Stage]{.mark}" for
China]{.underline}. The CCP has fulfilled the promise of former
paramount leader Deng Xiaoping -- achieving a "moderately prosperous
society" through market reforms, partial opening and liberalization and
other means over the past 40 years. The new goal set by Xi for "New
China" is to become a "Modern Socialist Country" by 2049. Exact
benchmarks to achieve that goal are not set in stone. What is clear thus
far are the core elements of Xi's vision -- namely technological
self-sufficiency, a closely steered government economy, and China's
ambition to become a technology superpower. [The [strict regulation of
big tech companies]{.mark} we are witnessing at the moment [is]{.mark}
therefore not the genuine focus of policymakers, but merely the first,
i[mmediate result of implementing the larger national vision]{.mark}
over the next 30 years]{.underline}. This vision was gradually
introduced in recent years in the form of new institutions with a
rapidly expanded legal framework. Bolstered with fresh manpower
resources, enforcers are empowered to test these new institutional
powers. The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), for
example, was only founded in 2018. Aimed at market regulation, it
enforces the Anti-Unfair Competition Law that has been in effect since
2019. [The SAMR has successfully investigated more than 3,000 cases of
unfair competition and collected 206 million renminbi (RMB) in fines in
the first half of 2021]{.underline}. It has also made use of the new
E-Commerce Law, effective since 2019, and the recently updated
Anti-Monopoly Law. Meanwhile, China's new cyber watchdog, the Cyberspace
Administration of China (CAC) found in 2014, has focused on implementing
the 2017 Cyber Security Law and the 2021 Data Security Law. It found
more than 100 apps in violation of collecting users' personal
information and ordered Didi, China's biggest ride-hailing app, to be
taken off app stores. Didi and other Chinese tech behemoths saw
exponential growth in the last decade attributed, in part, to an absence
of regulatory oversight. [To drive sales and revenue, companies engaged
in business models that came with a host of financial risks and
"regulatory problems]{.underline}." [[Now the government is keen to
tackle]{.mark} those [issues in the name of safeguarding consumer
rights]{.mark} against freewheeling businesses]{.underline}. A clean-up
of unfair business practices is long overdue. As a result[, China's
internet sector, once the hotbed of tech innovations, is now forced to
undergo profound changes]{.underline}. Eighty percent of misleading
advertisements to third party webpages, a vital source of income for
many apps and websites, have been taken down. Financial pressure aside,
restructuring businesses to comply with the rules has also resulted in
lay-offs not just in ad sales, but in gaming and private tutoring, the
other two sectors hardest hit by the regulations. Foreign firms
operating in China have not been spared. Caving to regulatory pressure
as new data and privacy laws came into effect , Microsoft's LinkedIn
pulled its social media services in the country and Yahoo bowed out of
China, both citing the "challenging environment" as reason. Further
adjustments lie ahead in 2022, not least because of the planned
three-year clean-up program for algorithms. A fresh suite of draft
regulations overseeing cross-border data transfer, and amendments for
tighter enforcement of the Anti-Monopoly Law only adds to the
uncertainty and pressure looming for firms to comply and conform to Xi
Jinping's "New China."

#### Massive regulations from the government ensure no regulatory capture.

regulation of digital technology";

[With foreign competitors such as Facebook and Google
blocked]{.underline}, [[domestic tech giants have for two decades
dominated the Chinese market]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Communist Party
has kept a firm grip on politics, but the tech firms have had
considerable leeway in their business activities. "It was a Wild West
within an authoritarian system," says Martin Chorzempa of the Peterson
Institute, an American think-tank. [Now the Communist Party is reminding
internet billionaires who is boss]{.underline}. President
[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping has [[authorised an extraordinary
crackdown]{.underline}]{.mark}. Last year the planned ipo of Ant Group,
a giant internet finance company, was halted at the last moment. In
July, two days after Didi, a ride-hailing firm, went public in New York,
China's internet regulator ordered it to stop signing up new users, and
forced its apps off mobile stores. The city of Beijing on September 6th
denied reports that it is considering taking Didi under state control.
Video-game companies are being pushed into scanning their users' faces
to help enforce a ban on children playing online games for more than
three hours a week. [The crackdown has [shifted the
balance]{.mark}]{.underline}, says Mr Chorzempa. Now,
"[[technocrats]{.mark}, who have been frustrated for years that
companies ignore proper, sensible regulations, [are
empowered]{.mark}]{.underline}." [The party is pushing for more than
superficial change]{.underline}. [It is using a suite of new laws and
regulations to force tech firms to alter both their behaviour and their
products]{.underline}. The aim is to control what Chinese people see and
do online. The new rules will require tech firms to write code for their
platforms so that they promote content that the government likes, and
inhibit what it does not. This is likely to be more efficient than the
whack-a-mole approach of enforcing the party's will case by case, and
plausible at a scale that the labour-intensive approach of trying to
control technological systems directly would not be. In the past month
alone Chinese lawmakers have finalised at least four new laws and
regulations which, as they go into effect over the next three months,
will [[have the potential to reshape the Chinese
internet]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Technology regulations in other
countries and regions]{.underline}, such as Europe's General Data
Protection Regulation (gdpr), [mostly require companies to obtain their
customers' consent for the specific processing of their
data.]{.underline} **[[China's new rules are much stricter]{.mark} and
more wide-ranging]{.underline}**. [[Tech firms will be expected to
protect national security and public order]{.underline}]{.mark}, says
Nicolas Bahmanyar, a data-privacy consultant with Leaf, a law firm in
Beijing. "A little banner is not going to cut it," he adds. A Personal
Information Protection Law (pipl), China's first privacy law, comes into
effect on November 1st. Years in the making, it is much shorter and less
detailed than gdpr, which inspired it, laying out principles that are
both broad and intentionally vague. Details and future reinterpretations
are to be dealt with by regulations particular to certain industries or
technologies. This, says Mr Bahmanyar, allows regulation to keep pace
with fast-changing technology. It also [gives the government leeway to
enforce vague rules as it sees fit]{.underline}. Didi was hit by rules
brought in to govern companies whose digital services are seen as
critical infrastructure. These were rewritten to cover foreign listings
just as the firm was attempting to go public. Not all new laws will
worry investors as much as the ones used to clobber Didi. Some deal with
problems that affect the West, too. One forthcoming set of regulations
published in draft on August 27th by the Cyberspace Administration of
China (cac) looks to set the rules for the use of recommendation
algorithms. This is the sort of software that companies like Amazon and
Alibaba use to recommend products based on a customer's shopping
history, or that short-video apps like TikTok use to work out what
viewers like in order to give them more of it. The draft regulations
require, for instance, that companies expose the keywords with which
they have labelled their users, and allow users to delete them. This, in
principle, will mean that internet users in China will no longer be
dogged by advertisements for the refrigerator that a recommendation
algorithm has decided they might like to buy. [Writing algorithms which
lead users to "addiction or high-value consumption" would also be
banned]{.underline}. Algorithms which dispatch workers, such as Didi's
driver-management system, must "ensure workers' rights and interests".
The regulations read like an attempt to fix the problems griped about by
consumers everywhere. They also require firms that deploy recommendation
algorithms to "uphold mainstream values" and to "vigorously disseminate
positive energy". Such algorithms must not be used to "engage in
activities harming national security" or to upset the economic or social
order. As such, their aim seems to be to withhold algorithmic juice from
any content that does not make the government look good. Kendra Schaefer
of Trivium, a consultancy in Beijing, has written that the publication
of these new algorithm regulations marks the moment when Chinese tech
laws have gone beyond those in Europe (in America, only California has
such rules). **[[Data-protection experts say many of these changes will
be beneficial]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Chinese internet users are
constantly assailed by spam messages and phone calls. An app developed
by the ministry of public security, which promises to screen fraudulent
calls and messages, has become one of the most downloaded in China since
it was released in March. The Chinese press is full of stories about
people's personal data being stolen. In 2016 Xu Yuyu, a prospective
student, died of a heart attack after transferring her life savings to
fraudsters who used personal data purchased on the black market to trick
her into thinking they represented her university. Protecting people
from such predations will burnish the party's reputation for standing up
for the little guy. **[The new rules [give citizens more rights against
companies than people in any other country]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But
they give Chinese internet users precisely no privacy rights enforceable
against the state. Indeed, says Sajai Singh of J. Sagar Associates, a
law firm in Bangalore, the creation of a single common standard for the
treatment of data in China will make it easier for the state to spy on
citizens. Mr Chorzempa says rewriting the law to make firms rewrite
software is a sea change. Once they start feeling they can intervene "at
this level and granularity, what else will they do?" he asks.

administrative agencies serve the people]{.underline}. However, to the
extent that the Regulatory Five-Year Plan dictates guidance by ideology,
it is somewhat unclear how these new regulations and enforcement thereof
will be carried out. The first point commits to the "in-depth study and
implementation of Xi Jinping's thoughts on the rule of law," which
refers to Xi Jinping's writings and speeches that mention the topic.
This was laid out at the first Central Conference on Work Related to
Law-Based Governance in November 2020, where President Xi emphasized the
need to focus on the people, to uphold Constitution-based governance,
and to commit to the socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics.
While the new plan appears to aim at making government more efficient
and create a fair and stable business environment, it is not clear how
Communist ideology will impact the types of rules to be created and
enforced. Like Xi Jinping, [[the party]{.mark} is a living, breathing
entity that [takes a different view of how a government should be run
compared to its Western counterparts]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This is
[evidenced in the types of new technology]{.mark} [regulations]{.mark}
that China has recently laid out]{.underline}, particularly regulations
that attempt to curb social behavior. Therefore, while [we can expect
that [China will increase the number and enforcement of
regulations]{.mark}]{.underline}, [particularly in the tech
sector]{.underline}, we do not know exactly what types of regulations
will become a focus in the near future. [We can only speculate that
China will follow its current trajectory of tech-related
regulation]{.underline}s, implementing new rules that effectively reduce
the power of its home-grown Big Tech firms. China also tends to favor
domestic over international investors, and the concern that China has
been seeking to crack down on the VIE structure has led the U.S. SEC to
warn American investors over the riskiness of investing in Chinese
stocks. In addition, while [China has [committed to expanding
innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}, we now know as a result of these new
regulations that innovations must have their own built-in guardrails. In
other words, innovations must be mindful of following ever-evolving
Communist Party dictum and best practices. [Innovations should serve the
people and the Party when everything is taken into
consideration]{.underline}. What precisely that means is unclear but is
likely to become somewhat more intelligible over time. So, [what can one
expect for the future? More regulations]{.underline}---especially rules
that coincide with high-level political objectives and directives over
time as well as those that reduce socioeconomic instability[. We also
[expect more enforcement of existing regulations across
industries]{.mark} and more activity by SAMR on anti-monopoly
activity]{.underline}. The swathe of new regulations and the Regulatory
Five-Year Plan are a call to arms by Chinese regulators. As such, U.S.
investors should study these regulatory plans carefully to reduce
uncertainty.

### 2nc \-\-- Tech Race

#### The tech race is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Self-Fulfilling Prophecy of High Tech War,"

In fall of 2014, former [Defense Secretary]{.underline} Chuck
[Hagel]{.underline} announced his [plan to maintain US superiority
against rising powers]{.underline} (i.e. Russia and China). His [claim
was that the US cannot lose its technological edge]{.underline} -- and
thus superiority -- [against]{.underline} a modernizing Russia and a
rapidly militarizing [China]{.underline}. To ensure this edge, [he
called for the "third Offset Strategy]{.underline}." The previous two
offset strategies were premised on Cold War rivalry and the belief that
one can outspend the other through arms races. The first offset desired
to gain dominance over Soviet Russia's feared advantage in manpower and
technological prowess. The US sought to deter the Soviets from engaging
in a nuclear war. Aside from building up vast arrays of nuclear weapons,
both at the tactical and strategic size, as well as creating and
detonating thermonuclear weapons, and detonating nuclear weapons in
space, both sides amazingly did not engage in direct hostilities. I do
not know if the offset strategy had anything to do with this or not, but
one could certainly argue that it increased the likelihood of a nuclear
confrontation, given that we know during one of the most tense foreign
policy situations in history -- the Cuban Missile Crisis -- four (yes
four) nuclear weapons were detonated during the crisis. What is more, we
also know that the US and the Soviets continually engaged in proxy wars.
The second offset sought ways to fight against a numerically superior
force; the results were increases in sensor technologies, command and
control technologies, stealth technology, precision-guided munitions,
lasers and unmanned vehicles. In an attempt at both creating defensive
capacities domestically, and generating new technologies to fight the
war in Vietnam, the US amassed the ability to wage network centric
warfare. While the capability was not fully realized until Gulf War I,
the legwork for much of the technology development was carried out
during the 1970s. After Gulf War I, the US technological dominance was
not missed by other powers. To counter the offset, these powers began
rethinking ways to deny US maneuverability and access. It is this fear,
of anti-access area-denial -- that has given rise to the third offset.
[In Hagel's estimation, the US requires a: "New Long-Range Research and
Development Planning Program that will help identify, develop, and field
breakthroughs in the most cutting-edge technologies and
systems]{.underline} -- [especially from the fields of robotics,
autonomous systems, miniaturization, big data, and advanced
manufacturing, including 3D printing]{.underline}." To lead the charge,
Hagel appointed Undersecretary of Defense, Bob Work. Work, a former
Colonel in the Marine Corps, is a tall and imposing man. He brooks no
nonsense, and is forthright in his estimation that Russia and China pose
the biggest threats to US security. Speaking this past November at the
Halifax International Security Forum, [Work stated "great power
competition has returned]{.underline}." He [argued that the US must
utilize a "strong but balanced" approach to these near
competitors]{.underline}. Aside from wondering how an "offset strategy,"
premised on the notion that one is technologically superior can work
with a "balanced" approach, [Work's plan to pursue the third offset
through autonomous technologies, artificial intelligence, robotics and
big data was a bit of a mystery]{.underline} until earlier this month
when he gave a speech at the Center for New American Security (where he
was briefly CEO). There he stated that the Defense Department is seeking
\$12 to 15 billion in its 2017 budget to advance these technologies and
to "kick the crap out of people who grew up in the iWorld under an
authoritarian reign." \$15 billion. To get a handle on what this figure
means, we should put it into perspective. The overall defense budget is
somewhere on the order of \$550 billion (excluding contingency and a
black budget). Thus the third offset doesn't really seem that large.
However, compare this to NASA's entire budget, which is somewhere in the
\$17 billion ballpark. Or think of it relationally to other state's
military budgets. Adjusted for inflation, Canada spends roughly \$16
billion on its **[entire]{.underline}** military force, and this was
when conservative Stephen Harper was in power. Thus [the US is getting
ready to spend the same amount on autonomous weapons, artificial
intelligence, robotics and other high tech weapons as Canada spends on
all of its weapons]{.underline}, personnel, and logistics combined. [It
is thus clear that such a dramatic increase in research and development
for Offset3 will change the character of future war]{.underline}. But
what of the assumptions of this strategy? To begin, [one might want to
wonder whether preparing for near-peer conflict is the best strategy
going forward]{.underline}, given that we know that non-international
armed conflict and hybrid war is the new normal. [Preparing for a war
that is unlikely to play out on a formalized decision tree is unhelpful
at best]{.underline}, and how these near-peers might test this
technology is open to question (given that many of these conflicts are
operationally inappropriate for such weapons). Another thought might be
that relying on tactical approaches---due to the thinking that
technology will solve the problem---will fail to address the need for
**[strategic thinking]{.underline}**. Technology is not "the" answer.
[Technology and technological development can only aid one in obtaining
one's predetermined goals]{.underline}. If one does not have a clear end
point in mind, then one cannot know which technologies to develop. What
is more, [claiming that the US must "offset" a rising China and a
modernizing Russia is not a strategy]{.underline}. It is a
countermeasure. Finally, the assumptions driving the DoD, and
particularly Work, are still mired in a Cold War perspective. Work has
mentioned the "AirLand Battle 2.0", without really explaining how this
is different than the Air Land Battle 1.0 (which can be found in US Army
Field Manual 100-5 from 1976). If we are to think that the AirLand
Battle 2.0 is qualitatively different than its Cold War predecessor, I'd
like to know how. For instance, [Work describes how warfare will be
"hybrid" and "asymmetric" and that we need to learn how to fight and win
in these environments, but then he falls back on a strategic mindset
that is not strategic.]{.underline} AirLand Battle 1.0 was a doctrine
about how to fight. It was an operational and tactical handbook. It was
not a strategic perspective. As Romjue points out in 1984: "FM 100-5
adds precision to earlier statements of the AirLand Battle concept. It
is explicit about the intent of U.S. Army doctrine, and it conveys a
vigorous offensive spirit. AirLand Battle doctrine "is based on securing
or retaining the initiative and exercising it aggressively to defeat the
enemy. . . . Army units will. . . . attack the enemy in depth with fire
and maneuver and synchronize all efforts to attain the objective." it
also notes that "our operations must be rapid, unpredictable, violent,
and disorienting to the enemy.'" So where does this leave us in 2016 and
beyond? First, [it is beyond unhelpful to revisit the well of "offset
strategies]{.underline}" and Cold War doctrine. As Khong rightly noted
over 20 years ago, analogizing current foreign policy situations is not
very helpful. Likewise thinking that what worked in 1959 or in 1972 will
not work now. Second, [the types of technologies that the DoD is
pursuing are qualitatively different than their
predecessors]{.underline}. This is not to say that they are more or less
dangerous. It is to say that what [Work and his colleagues are after is
the ability of nonhuman agents to make decisions on and in the
battlespace]{.underline}. Autonomous technologies are not, as I've
argued elsewhere, "smarter smart bombs." In other words, they are not
precision-guided munitions; rather they are "deciding munitions." Where
a human being decides a particular target and launches munitions to that
target, an autonomous weapon or an artificial intelligence, would be the
entity deciding. Whichever munitions it launches is beside the point. In
the end, [it appears that the US fear of losing its technological edge
to near-peer competitor nations is a self-fulfilling
prophecy]{.underline}. That is, [the more it pursues this particular
offset, the greater the chances that all sides will simultaneously
benefit from these advances]{.underline}. [Creating stronger AI is not
like building thermonuclear warheads]{.underline}. The materials are
easy to come by, the knowledge is readily available, and the commercial
sector is driving the way. Moreover, if we are to abide by the same
doctrinal insights from forty plus years ago without questioning their
applicability or appropriateness, then perhaps we should also embrace
some of the other gems of the day, like building fallout shelters,
smoking on air planes and shooting student protesters who question war.

### 2nc \-\-- Regulatory Capture

#### Private companies develop unregulated AI.

[Fresh breakthroughs in artificial intelligence come thick and fast
these days]{.underline}. Last month, Google's DeepMind revealed its
latest Go-playing AI which mastered the ancient game from scratch in a
mere 70 hours. AI can spot cancer in medical scans better than humans,
meaning radiotherapy can be targeted in minutes, not hours. [We may soon
use the technology to design new drugs, or repurpose existing ones to
treat other, neglected, diseases]{.underline}. [But as we begin to
realise these opportunities, the potential risks increase: that AI will
proliferate, uncontrolled and unregulated, in the hands of a few
increasingly powerful technology firms]{.underline}, at the expense of
jobs, equality and privacy. [Already, mistakes]{.underline} over the
sharing of patient records between DeepMind and the Royal Free Hospital
in London [have raised public concerns]{.underline} about technology
firms being involved in digital healthcare. As the Guardian reported
this week, [the danger of a public backlash to AI]{.underline}, similar
to that seen with the introduction of genetically modified crops, [is
very real]{.underline}. There are similarities -- the concern about
unforeseen consequences, the complexity of the new technology, the need
for public engagement and, above all, the role of industry. With GM
crops, businesses initially reaped the benefits, while society bore the
risks and the same may well apply to AI. But there are also significant
differences. The barriers to introducing AI are much lower than for GM
crops, where trials must be approved, as must the sale of seeds and
products. Online, there are no borders, and national regulation is
either non-existent or difficult to enforce. So [the real worry about a
public backlash is that the response will not be widespread regulation
of the whole marketplace, but instead a clampdown on the use of AI in
the public sector]{.underline}. [Private companies will continue to use
AI, unregulated, to improve the targeting of products]{.underline}. [But
in the public sector]{.underline} where there could be life-changing
benefits, [over-regulation will mean the opportunities will be
lost]{.underline}. That is not to say that AI should be allowed to
spread uncontrolled in the NHS. But it does emphasise why it's so
important to get this right. AI can only be introduced successfully in
the NHS if the public, patients and healthcare professionals have
confidence in the system, including clear oversight and accountability.
[Transparency is essential]{.underline}, and so too is a meaningful
conversation with the public -- something that was lacking with the
failed care.data programme and the DeepMind partnership with the Royal
Free. Having an early discussion about the value of data, and finding a
way for the NHS to realise that value when using services based on
algorithms requiring patient data, is crucial. Finally, the implications
for the patient and clinician, and issues of fair access and benefit,
must be fully addressed. While there is a risk that a GM-style backlash
could prevent the appropriate application of AI in healthcare, we should
not give up hope. As the Information Commissioner has recently
emphasised, it does not need to be a choice between privacy or
innovation. The example of embryo research and the recent approval of
mitochondrial donation -- so-called "three parent babies" -- shows that
the UK has learnt from the mistakes of GM crops. New technologies can be
introduced with public confidence if done carefully, with clear
oversight, a robust regulatory framework, wide-reaching debate about the
ethical and social implications, and, above all, meaningful public
consultation. We must follow the same approach with AI, to ensure that,
ultimately, it is the patient who wins the game.

Over the past few years, the position of China on the international
stage has gradually evolved, following its rise as an economic power,
visible in its rapidly increasing trade and investment flows. [China's
evolving rol]{.underline}e has also [had]{.underline} **[implications
for its place in global governance]{.underline}**, [through a greater
involvement in activities ranging from]{.underline} United Nations
[peacekeeping operatio]{.underline}ns (China is by far the biggest
contributor of personnel, with more than 3,000 troops and police
committed) [to contributions to de**velopment funds**]{.underline} (Xi
Jinping pledged \$2 billion in support for the development of poor
countries at the Sustainable Development Summit in 2015). Numerous
Chinese scholars have started to rethink China's role and consider new
strategies that would help the country [offer]{.underline}
**[alternative models]{.underline}** [for **international cooperation**
and]{.underline} **[governance]{.underline}** for development. Cui
Wenxing, a post-doctoral fellow at Fudan University, writes that there
have been three main stages of evolution in China's development policy.
Firstly, under Mao, when the country's south-south cooperation was
essentially based on political considerations (such as providing
assistance to socialist countries).\[20\] Secondly, after the reform and
opening up, when China shifted its focus essentially to economic
cooperation with other countries (in all directions), and, finally, the
acceleration of the "going out" movement (走出去 zouchuqu) in the 21st
century, when south-south cooperation became a way for China to
encourage its enterprises to go abroad and to take part in global
development.\[21\] Cui believes that both the "going out" movement and
China's development agenda provided opportunities for Chinese
enterprises for more economic cooperation (for instance, via low
interest loans provided to Chinese enterprises in developing countries).
For Xu Qiyuan, associate research fellow at the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, and Sun Jingying, postdoctoral fellow at Beijing
University, even if "it is clear that China is still a developing
country", its role has evolved from that of recipient country to one of
donor country, and [China has **become an important partner of
international development agencies.\[**]{.underline}22\] China's role in
the development of **[south-south cooperation]{.underline}** has been
increasing tremendously. The [time]{.underline} has come, say these
authors, [for China to build]{.underline} a **["new global partnership
for development]{.underline}**" (建新型全球发展伙伴关系 jian xinxing
quanqiu fazhan huoban guanxi), arguing that this new approach should put
aside political issues but [focus partnerships on pragmatic
interests]{.underline}.\[23\] Chinese [criticism of the **UN development
agenda**]{.underline} Chinese scholars point to the imperfections of the
development framework that the United Nations has promoted since its
foundation in 1945. Some Chinese scholars, such as Xu and Sun, recognise
that the UN's development framework managed to gradually mobilise the
international community, that it has achieved some level of agreement on
key concepts relating to development ([such **as environmental issues,
climate change, or sustainable development goals**]{.underline}), and
that it has contributed to the formulation of the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). However, several problems remain in the view of these
authors. Among other issues, they note that the MDGs [have
had]{.underline} **[mixed results]{.underline}**, [such as uneven
progress geographically, and areas of development lagging
behin]{.underline}d, such as universal access to primary education,
maternal healthcare, and environmental sustainability. In addition, they
believe that the [development framework has sometimes focused too much
on political issues]{.underline} -- for instance, the controversial
conditions attached to aid, which relate to governance, transparency,
and human rights. In their view these issues should be separated from a
country's development goals. In particular, Xu and Sun argue that [donor
countries often link environmental aspects of sustainable development to
political aspects]{.underline} that oppose the principle of "common but
differentiated responsibilities", a phrase which is important to
developing countries. Developed countries ("traditional aid countries")
indeed usually put emphasis on a "universal" principle of environmental
responsibility, resulting in environmental sustainability goals being
placed at the forefront of priorities.\[24\] In addition, for Cui, the
"shock therapy" of the World Bank has had significant downsides, by
forcing countries to adopt austerity policies and to engage in market
liberalisation over short periods of time, instead of progressively
changing policies based on long-term research and experimentation.\[25\]
China's development agenda and the UN In the view of Xu, Sun, and Cui,
[China has implemented a successful]{.underline} **[economic development
model]{.underline}** and it has [performed well in its progress towards
the MDGs,]{.underline} all of which (in their view) relate to Deng
Xiaoping's development paradigm "crossing the river by feeling the
stones" (摸着石头过河 mozhe shitou guohe), [which]{.underline}
**[provided a smoother alternative]{.underline}** to the shock therapy
of the World Bank.\[26\] However, the author/authors believes that
[there is a role for China to play in **redefining a more balanced
global partnership for development**]{.underline}, that would better
reflect the rise of south-south cooperation and the growing role of
emerging economies.\[27\] Xu, Sun, and Cao Jiahan (assistant research
fellow at the Research Institute of Comparative Politics and Public
Policy) recognise that the new role that China could play at the global
level should take into account organisations which already exist, such
as the development agencies of traditional aid countries or the UN
agencies in charge of implementing the 2030 Development Agenda. For
them, connecting Chinese development initiatives to the agenda of these
organisations could indeed help increase trust in these initiatives. The
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), in particular, has recently raised some
concerns in the international community, in Western countries in
particular. For Cao, connecting the BRI agenda to the United Nations'
2030 Development Agenda could be a way to "increase trust and dispel
doubts" ( 增信释疑 zengxin shiyi) and to exert greater international
influence, as the BRI [represents]{.underline} "an [attempt by China to
explore a **new model of international cooperation for development and
global governance**]{.underline}". \[28\]

\"Existential Gap: Digital/AI Acceleration and the Missing Global
Governance Capacity,\" Centre for International Governance Innovation,
2-14-2022,
https://www.cigionline.org/articles/existential-gap-digitalai-acceleration-and-the-missing-global-governance-capacity/,

We are [facing]{.underline} an **[ever-growing gap]{.underline}**
[between the phenomenal **acceleration of technology**]{.underline} and
of connectivity, [and the human capacity to **manage these
trends**]{.underline}. The gap is well-documented in the [fields of
**finance, climate change, pandemics and nuclear risks.**]{.underline}
But the contrast between the exponential growth of disruptive technology
and the lacklustre supply of governance mechanisms is starkest in the
fields of digital governance and artificial intelligence (AI).

That [gap becomes **existential**]{.underline} [when we consider the
likely future development of]{.underline} **[artificial]{.underline}**
general **[intelligence]{.underline}** (AGI) (Ord 2020) or
superintelligence (Bostrom 2015) [that can be
**misaligned**]{.underline} with human values or even the goal of
ensuring the continuity of human existence. This [question of the
governance of life with AI may be the most essential question of our
tim]{.underline}e (Tegmark 2017), but [you would not know it from the
**current output of global governance**]{.underline} in this field.
Summarizing the judgement of many scientists in the field, Toby Ord
argues that unaligned AGI is actually the number-one global existential
risk for humanity, with a 10 percent chance of human extinction within
100 years. The prophesized existential threats posed by extreme and
accelerated technological advancement and expansion have never been as
close to reality as they are now. As noted by Yuval Noah Harari and
Daniel Kahneman (2021) in a recent conversation, [the task of taming and
governing the digital/AI **revolution is daunting**]{.underline}.
Humanity may have no slack for a mistake this time around, [given the
**existential consequences of**]{.underline} such **[a
mistake.]{.underline}**

Today, we already benefit from tremendous digital or AI innovations in
e-commerce, social media and communication, home management, work,
health care, education, transportation, and entertainment (West and
Allen 2020). We can foresee that AI-driven algorithms may soon be able
to correct human judgement flaws (or noise) caused by fatigue,
irregularity, emotions and other weaknesses, afflictions that can
generate variation in decisions by up to 50 percent (Kahneman, Sibony
and Sunstein 2021). Within two decades, we can envisage a world with
generalized deep learning and virtual reality, computer vision,
contactless love, fully autonomous vehicles in most advanced and
emerging economies, autonomous weapons in militaries and a dream of
plenitude (Lee and Chen 2021).

Yet, today, we witness tremendous havoc created by the explosion of
social anger, exacerbated by sophisticated social media algorithms, deep
polarization, the return of tribal politics, the loss of agreed truths
and the spread of misinformation and dangerous conspiracies, the loss of
privacy, the rise of massive and uber-powerful tech companies, and
massive job displacement and inequality (Bartlett 2018). Influence
operations by foreign states have also amplified such social anger and
polarization in many democracies, adding a degree of external threat and
urgency. [We also live with a world of
security]{.underline}-[driven]{.underline} digital
**[decoupling]{.underline}** [between]{.underline} **[the United States
and China]{.underline}** (Ma 2021). In other words, the digital
revolution is moving faster than the human capacity to cope with it,
embed it within a public good-oriented framework and steer its
disruptive power toward a non-destructive direction.

The [problem]{.underline} is visible at the national level but
**[particularly salient at the global level.]{.underline}** Digital/data
[governance]{.underline} is **[fragmenting among at least four
poles]{.underline}**: [a US model]{.underline} with maximum innovation
and limited regulation; [an EU model with a strong regulatory balance;
a]{.underline}n [India model]{.underline} with an [emphasis on digital
sovereignty]{.underline} and infant industry protection (applicable to
other developing countries); and a [Chinese model with both rapid
innovation, strong state control and surveillance]{.underline}. Our
[global governance capacity]{.underline} is **[affected by multiple
splits]{.underline}**: a US-EU split over privacy, tax and anti-monopoly
regulations; an India-West split over data ownership and first-mover
advantage; and, worst of all, a potential digital cold war between the
United States (and its allies) and China. In response to this dire need
for governance, Rohinton P. Medhora and Taylor Owen (2020) have proposed
a need for a new fundamental effort at coordinated governance --- or a
"digital Bretton Woods." While fundamental international conditions and
global distribution of power today differ drastically from the Bretton
Woods era, a high-stake and fragmented [digital world]{.underline} is
**[in dire need of]{.underline}** such renewed **[cooperative
spirit.]{.underline}**

Recognizing the gap in digital governance, we ask the following
questions: What is the scale of the gap in governance relative to
requirements needed to keep the digital economy afloat? And what could
be a pathway forward in the context of the growing securitization and
increasing divides?

[It is urgent to **raise a sense of awareness**]{.underline}, mobilize
all social and public actors around this urgent dilemma and catalyze a
multi-level effort to address this conundrum. We argue that no global,
regional or national institution alone will be able to deliver the right
governance capacity. Instead, we recommend a highly reactive, innovative
and competitive model of networked governance that operates at multiple
levels with key nodes and catalysts.

**[Governance innovation]{.underline}** [must keep pace with
**technological innovation**]{.underline}. Given how far the digital
cold war has already proceeded and the currently low capacity to
cooperate between the United States and China, part of the [solution
will need]{.underline} to involve clubs and alliances of countries and
non-state actors. At the same time, some level of **[global
coordination]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**basic rules for global

The authors argue instead for "**[liberal
internationalism,]{.underline}**" [better characterized as]{.underline}
primacy, or **[armed global dominance]{.underline}**, of the liberal
variety. However, [liberal primacy]{.underline}, a major influence in
Washington for decades, is itself partly **[responsible]{.underline}**
[for the]{.underline} [**crises of the current world order** and
is]{.underline} now **[enhancing risks of great power
conflict.]{.underline}** Moreover, liberal primacy
[marginalizes]{.underline} **[alternative]{.underline}** and quite
different **[versions of internationalism]{.underline}**, including
those well within the American tradition, [which]{.underline} have much
to contribute to [achieve]{.underline} a **[world of
security]{.underline}** and prosperity.

Deudney and Ikenberry's main arguments are as follows: The restraint
camp remains hostage to its critique of the American "blunder" in Iraq.
It is moreover incoherent due to its dissimilar factions of
libertarians, balance-of-power realists, and progressives, and thereby
offers only a negative agenda for shaping the future world order.
Restrainers purportedly provide no solutions to problems generated due
to industrialization and high interdependence, such as inequality and
climate change. Moreover, they resist defending and promoting democracy
in a world threatened by a rising and authoritarian China. "Liberal
internationalism" with its focus on democracy promotion, institutions,
and regulated capitalism is the only model that can solve the world's
problems.

Let us put aside for a moment the authors' misrepresentation of
positions of restrainers more generally, and those of the Quincy
Institute specifically. Let us also acknowledge the positive aspects of
the broader liberal project, which do not contradict a grand strategy of
restraint (and which the Quincy Institute supports.) Individualism and
democracy are welcome antidotes to social and political repression,
diversity mostly enriches societies, institutions help solve problems,
and versions of capitalism have proven superior to communism. Liberal
primacists' prioritization of collective action problems such as climate
change is also on the mark. But a closer examination reveals that some
of these supposed achievements are more rhetorical than real.

[Liberal primacy's stress on democracy would be credible]{.underline}
**[--- if only its deeds matched the claim]{.underline}**s. [Washington
is]{.underline} tough, **[even]{.underline}** militant, [on violations
of rights by its geopolitical adversaries,]{.underline} with sanctions
and harsh rhetoric routinely employed as a tool. Liberal primacists
indeed seem to be concerned with the fate of democracy in what they call
the "core" --- a reference to European allies. But [when it comes to
U.S. allies and partners]{.underline} in the Global South, **[they
rarely go beyond nudges and occasional slaps on the
wrist.]{.underline}**

Objective observers can conclude that, [outside of the Atlantic
area]{.underline}, **[democracy and human rights are only of marginal
importance]{.underline}** in the liberal primacy project, [except when
they can act as]{.underline} **[force-multipliers in the great power
competition framework]{.underline}**. Restrainers on the other hand
genuinely support democracy by directing the United States to perfect
its own model at home so that it can lead by example. Restrainers also
have a well-founded suspicion of the true motives of Washington's
actions (or any power that claims to be acting out of altruism) and, in
general, hold a pessimistic view of achieving changes in the domestic
politics of other societies through coercive measures.

Deudney and Ikenberry greatly stress liberal primacy to achieve global
economic equity and avert environmental catastrophe. However, [under
liberal primacy's]{.underline} long [innings]{.underline} in Washington,
these **[challenges have only multiplied]{.underline}** at home and
abroad. The [United States]{.underline}, under the major influence of
primacists of all shades, did not by itself create all these problems.
But its **[disproportionate power]{.underline}** and wealth [means that
it is]{.underline} more **[responsible]{.underline}** than any other
single actor. Moreover, [when liberal]{.underline} and other primacists
make extraordinary claims of global leadership and explicitly seek to
preserve unipolarity, they should also accept a corresponding level of
responsibility for all that has gone wrong under their watch.

Liberalism is also by no means necessarily tied to U.S. primacy. The
work of scholars such as Stephen Wertheim (a co-founder of the Quincy
Institute) and Michael Kazin has cogently highlighted a very different
American internationalism in the pre-WW II era that opposed primacy in
the long national tradition (notwithstanding a few exceptions) of
staying away from foreign wars and advocating diplomacy to resolve
disputes in extra-hemispheric conflicts. Nowhere do Deudney and
Ikenberry seriously engage the core argument of restrainers of armed
dominance detracting from domestic priorities and raising risks of
regional and global conflict.

Liberal primacists have belatedly come around to reducing (though not
eliminating) the U.S. military footprint in the Middle East. But, as
Quincy Institute president Andrew Bacevich has laid out, few lessons
appear to have been learned from the Iraq war, which was not so much a
"blunder" as a flagrant violation of international law and American
values. Nearly two decades after that fateful step, primacists (liberal
and otherwise) show little desire for accountability from actors who
supported and executed this war ridden with illegal actions, a
reluctance that severely undermines their justifications for prosecuting
violations of other states.

[It is on Chin]{.underline}a, however, [that liberal primacists flirt
with the **greatest danger to**]{.underline} the international order. A
[rising China is **framed as a threat**]{.underline}, predominantly due
to its authoritarian system as also its recent actions in the region.
Domestic and foreign policies of most states are indeed linked, but they
may manifest in apparently inconsistent ways. For example, [powerful,
authoritarian states]{.underline} **[may not necessarily seek global
conquest]{.underline}** or even dominance (for example, China in the
15th century) just as major democratic states may disavow global
hegemony (the United States itself from the late 19th century until
World War II). [Democratic powers **may also empower
tyranny**]{.underline}, as was seen with Israel's export of the
cyber-weapon Pegasus to several authoritarian governments recently.
[Liberal primacy has a]{.underline} **[deterministic]{.underline}**,
[inflated view of Chinese power]{.underline} and threat and [little
space for the **major uncertainty in Chinese capabilities**]{.underline}
and intentions two or three decades in the future.

Whereas Washington is stepping up on **[framing China in stark cold
war-type language,]{.underline}** much of the world, including many U.S.
partners, has a much more nuanced viewpoint of the competition. The
reluctance of Southeast Asia or treaty ally South Korea to join the
U.S.-led Quad and the general lack of support across much of the world
for the monochromatic view of China's Belt and Road Initiative as an
exploitative debt trap are two examples. Prominent Southeast Asian
voices in particular are increasingly worried at the turn liberal
primacists' China strategy is taking.

Whittling away at the time-tested One-China policy, over-militarization
of relations with the Quad states, and aggressive, publicly announced
military FONOPs close to the Chinese coast are only some of the ways in
which liberal and other primacists are [helping]{.underline} **[raise
risks of great power conflict.]{.underline}** [China is **not an
existential threat to the United States. This**]{.underline} is not to
say that China's excessive claims in the South China Sea, coercive
pressure on U.S. partners including Taiwan and India, exploitative
deep-sea fishing, cyber-attacks on the homeland, and certain trade
practices should not be of major concern. But [it takes **two hands to
clap.**]{.underline} When it comes to China, [liberal primacy's
reign]{.underline} in Washington **[feels as escalatory
as]{.underline}** the **[Trump]{.underline}** era.

[Liberal primacy is]{.underline} also **[less than
international]{.underline}**, with its continuing Euro- and Global
North-centric tendencies. **[Alternative
internationalisms]{.underline}** [include those from the Global South,
**where most of humanity lives.**]{.underline} Southern internationalism
matters to the U.S. national interest because, in [an increasingly
multipolar world]{.underline}, [regional and middle powers have enhanced
autonomy]{.underline} and capability [to exercise veto power if their
views of the world order are not taken into account.]{.underline}

As seen from the South, spreading democracy, managing interdependence,
and containing the rise of China --- Deudney and Ikenberry's principal
problematiques --- is a part-erroneous, part-limited list. A view from
Johannesburg, Dhaka, or Jakarta might argue that achieving domestic
stability, economic "catch-up" with the wealthy world, and avoiding
another militarized great power competition are more pressing concerns
(along with those of climate change and pandemics, correctly identified
by Deudney and Ikenberry). Moreover, [U.S. interventionism and coercive
strategies]{.underline} of extraterritorial sanctions (often backed by
liberal primacists) [might be seen as]{.underline} equally or **[more
threatening than the rise of China]{.underline}**. In general, Southern
internationalism stresses sovereignty, solidarity, and a search for
compromise rather than coercion in great power disputes.

[Southern internationalism has led to]{.underline} **[many
initiatives]{.underline}** of varying success -- from decolonization
itself, to Afro-Asian frameworks such as Bandung, the push for a New
International Economic Order, Tricontinentalism, and the Nonaligned
Movement. More recent examples include the Like-Minded Developing
Countries coalition in global climate negotiations. While some
practitioners of Southern internationalism were domestic autocrats,
paradoxically, their banding together also enabled a somewhat more
democratic world order by placing limits on the extent of bipolarity or
unipolarity[. Liberal primacists, either largely ignore or oppose other
internationalism]{.underline}s, domestic and foreign, [thereby revealing
their own paradox -- while democracy is backed at hom]{.underline}e, a
**[diversity of ideologies across states is distinctly
unwelcome.]{.underline}**

Deudney and Ikenberry are correct in that there are differences among
restrainers. But coming from advocates of the "Roosevelt School" this is
downright bizarre if not a sign of amnesia. FDR's multi-decade imprint
owed largely to his phenomenal success at crafting a diverse coalition
at home to address the central challenges of his time. Building -- and
sustaining -- such coalitions signifies maturity, not incoherence.

Restraint is a grand strategy comprised of first and foremost disavowing
armed global primacy and stressing diplomacy for conflict reduction and
management. This, by itself, is an enormous task that, if achieved,
would be a major accomplishment and greatly diminish risk of a great
power war. But beyond this common agenda, the young coalition will
naturally engage deeply with itself over time as it grows. Indeed,
primacists of the liberal and non-liberal variety who have been at this
for much longer than restrainers, are themselves characterized by
differences. The Quincy Institute, for its part, has laid out positive
agendas for achieving peaceful co-existence in East Asia (including its
maritime domain), South Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. These involve
reversing armed global dominance, stressing diplomacy and institutions,
letting regional players lead in solving their problems, abandoning
coercive attempts to spread American political values, and energetically
constructing confidence-building measures with major powers China and
Russia.

In sum, [liberal primacy,]{.underline} at best, is [mostly a
status-quoist ideology]{.underline} that is **[likely to only compound
emerging global challenges]{.underline}**. At worst, it is a thin veneer
over a deeper intent of perpetuating unipolarity for its own sake.
Either way, [it is an outmoded approach to our time of uncertainty,
**increasing multipolarity, and a planetary crisis**]{.underline}.
Restraint may be, as Deudney and Ikenberry state, a "radical challenge
to the main course of American foreign policy." But it is exactly the
[corrective we need to American grand strategy **that can pave the way
for a more secure and prosperous world order.**]{.underline}

**The Global Times** 07-29-**21** \["Living in China's technological
miracle: CPC's innovation-driven strategy powers xiaokang society";
https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202107/1230033.shtml//ZW\]

**Editor\'s Note:** On July 1, [China declared it had reached its first
centenary development goal - building a]{.underline} moderately
[prosperous society]{.underline}, or xiaokang, in all respects and is
marching confidently toward the second centenary goal of building China
into a great modern socialist nation. To decipher what that means in the
context of where China is now and where it\'s heading, the Global Times
is publishing a series of multimedia productions about achievements
under the xiaokang goal in various aspects. This piece focuses on
technological miracles that have changed people\'s lives. If China were
able to build a time machine and send one of its 1.4 billion citizens
back to the late 1970s, the person would be stuck in a kerosene
lamp-powered life without any electronics. Communication with family and
friends would rely on mail carriers. Long-distance travel would mean
standing in slow-moving trains for hours or days. Grocery shopping would
require different stamps for different items. Those are just several
aspects of what the life of an ordinary Chinese person looked like
before China embarked on what has been an unparalleled journey to
building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, or xiaokang -
the 2,500-year old concept that was revived by late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping in 1979 to describe China\'s goal of modernization. China might
not be able to build a time machine. However, the changes brought about
by the country\'s achievement in science and technology for ordinary
Chinese people over the past four decades or so are just as magical as
they are miraculous. [[Thanks to technological breakthroughs in various
areas]{.mark}, kerosene lamps have been replaced with smart lights
controlled by voice command or even the sole presence of a person and
powered by greener energies]{.underline}. Mail carriers have been
replaced with 5G-powered equipment ensuring that family and friends are
just a button away. Old slow trains have been replaced with ultra-fast
high-speed rail. And to buy groceries, you might just need to scan your
face, if you have to show up at all. Over the past four decades, life in
most countries around the world has been changed by advances in science
and technology, but none could possibly match the pace or the extent of
the change in Chinese life. **[What [China has achieved in terms of
scientific and technological advances is nothing short of a
miracle]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [It\'s hard to pinpoint
[China]{.mark}\'s scientific and technological advances as it [leads
in]{.mark} countless areas from [renewable energy to 5G network]{.mark},
and high-speed rail [to]{.mark} artificial intelligence ([AI]{.mark}),
and has numerous world-leading companies]{.underline}. **Miraculous
advances** Several statistics may put things into perspective. China\'s
annual research and development (R&D) spending grew 169 times over from
around 14.3 billion yuan (\$2.21 billion) at the beginning of the 1990s
to 2.44 trillion yuan in 2020. Based on exchange rate conversion,
China\'s total R&D expenditures overtook Japan\'s in 2013, becoming the
world\'s second after the US. \[graphic omitted\] China saw its patent
applications flourishing from zero case prior to 1985 to 68,720 filings
in 2020, having led the world in the number of patent filings since 2011
and overtaking the US in 2019. China has also surpassed the US in terms
of the number of academic research papers in 2016. The profound progress
in China\'s scientific and technological capabilities is an integral
part of China\'s xiaokang goal, which contains a sweeping set of targets
including economic growth, poverty alleviation, as well as technological
innovation. At the centennial of the Communist Party of China (CPC) on
July 1, [Xi]{.underline} Jinping, Chinese president and general
secretary of the CPC Central Committee, [declared the completion of the
goal and called for [further building up of the country\'s strength in
science and technology]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Technological innovation
and independence have been included as a core part of the CPC\'s next
centennial goal]{.underline} of building China into a modern socialist
power by 2050. And with the CPC\'s firm leadership, innovation-driven
strategies, and unique institutional strength[, [China is
well-positioned to become a technological
superpower]{.underline}]{.mark} [along the journey to socialist
modernization]{.underline}, analysts have said. \"The institutional
advantage of socialism with Chinese characteristics, as reflected in the
CPC\'s centralized and unified leadership, is also a key factor that
drives the nation to concentrate its efforts on major tasks in order to
make breakthroughs in areas that are closely related to national
security and core competitiveness,\" Sun Fuquan, vice-president of the
Beijing-based Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development,
affiliated with the Ministry of Science and Technology, told the Global
Times. Some current global technological leaders, most notably the US,
have been increasingly nervous about China\'s technological rise and
have even moved to contain China\'s rise. However, just as technological
advancements under the xiaokang goal were aimed primarily at improving
the livelihood of the Chinese people, China\'s pursuit of further
scientific and technological advances are also aimed at further
improving the lives of the Chinese people, analysts have said. To
understand where China is headed in terms of how future technologies
could change lives, it\'s noteworthy to look back at how China\'s
achievements over the past several decades completely changed the most
basic aspects of life that many have taken for granted. [Kerosene lamp
to green brightness]{.underline} With China\'s electricity market design
highlighting a wide-reaching network of ultra-high voltage (UHV)
transmission lines and [[a gradual shift toward renewable
energy]{.underline}]{.mark}, the country\'s rise as the [world\'s
second-largest economy has been well underpinned by its miraculous
advance in terms of power]{.underline}, experts have said[. Such a
[miracle]{.mark} apparently [overshadows the US,]{.mark} which is still
being haunted by blackouts, as slow UHV progress versus an over-reliance
on non-renewable energy fundamentally challenges the stability of the US
power supply]{.underline}. Recollecting herself as a young woman in her
mid-20s when the xiaokang goal began, a 65-year-old retiree from East
China\'s Anhui Province surname Xing told the Global Times that a
typical nightlife scene then was family members sitting around a
kerosene lamp. Later on, during the early days when electric lights
became initially available, kerosene lamps, candles, and flashlights
remained viable alternatives. Over four decades on, she now takes the
brightness of bulbs as a guarantee wherever she might be and she even
has a handful of color-changing lighting devices that react to her touch
and could be synced to music. She said she\'s now gotten accustomed to
the company of a wide array of home appliances and electronics gadgets.
As the country continued to gain economic momentum over the years, its
electricity consumption has soared amid the influx of various digital
gadgets into Chinese households. Last year, the country\'s power
consumption grew by 3.1 percent from the previous year to 7.51 trillion
kilowatt hours, official data showed. Back in 1979, China only consumed
276.2 billion kilowatt hours, media reports said. \[graphic
omitted\]Behind the vicissitudes of life is the country\'s electricity
revolution that has rendered different sources of power an increasingly
important part of its technological rise. [With a national network of
UHV transmission lines in place that transmit energy over a long
distance, linking far-flung interior regions with abundant solar, wind,
hydro, and nuclear power to energy-thirsty coastal regions, [China has
taken the global lead in enabling efficient, cost effective, and
environmentally friendly power transmission]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
transition underway toward renewable energy, notably solar and wind
power, is considered as the cornerstone of the Chinese economy\'s aim to
hit peak emission by 2030 before becoming carbon neutral by 2060. By
comparison, the US, a major global energy producer and consumer, has
made slow progress in building a powerful national electricity grid,
although a UHV transmission superstructure is widely seen as a solution
to the aging transmission infrastructure that ~~cripples~~ \[weakens\]
the nation. **Mail carriers to 5G network** Another high-profile
technological miracle is the giant leap [China has taken in eventually
establishing itself as a world leader in 5G]{.underline}, to the extent
of unnerving the US which has gone to extreme lengths to sanction
Chinese 5G equipment vendors, notably Huawei, industry watchers have
said, attributing the feat to the country\'s continued, forward-looking
commitments to updating its telecom infrastructure. The eagerness for
the arrival of mail carriers to make a delayed connection with your
friends or family members, and the excitement of making a call on a
public rotary dial telephone, among the common things in the earlier
decades were only emblems pictured in some TV episodes or movies of that
era. With a 1 billion-strong population of internet users, the country
is now acknowledged as the global paradise for mobile communications
where tech-savvy users with at least one smartphone are now deeply
immersed in a mobile internet-linked world: Real-time video calls or
conferences, geographically unbound mobile payments, shopping, food
ordering, and taxi-hailing, among other activities that are all powered
by the country\'s almighty mobile network. By the end of 2020, China\'s
mobile phone subscribers had reached 1.59 billion. In stark contrast,
there were only 3,000 subscribers in 1988 when China ushered in the era
of mobile communications for the first time.\[graphic omitted\] By the
end of 2020, a total of 989 million users in China were enjoying fast
connectivity speeds and a rich variety of internet content by surfing on
the web. In stark contrast, only 620,000 people could have access to the
internet in 1997, the first year that marked China\'s entrance into the
age of the internet. With internet-related industries taking a huge
step, the country has rolled out 916,000 5G base stations, accounting
for 70 percent of the world\'s total, and it\'s now home to over 365
million 5G-connected devices, making up 80 percent of the world\'s
total, according to latest official data. [The country\'s rise as a
global leader in the 5G era, with domestic heavyweights including Huawei
sitting atop the world\'s 5G-related patents, has unnerved the US in
particular]{.underline}. Feeling frequently on edge over the past few
years, the US government has gone to desperate lengths to add a rising
number of Chinese entities and businesses to its export control and
sanction lists. China, for its part, has been pushing even harder into a
head start in next-generation wireless communication. In a fresh sign,
Shanghai, where its Pudong New Area has recently been declared to be
built into a pioneer area for socialist modernization in the coming
decades, on July 21 unveiled a plan for the development of strategic,
emerging industries during the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25). The
development plan prioritizes breakthroughs in 6G core technologies and
the active participation in 6G standardization competitions. **Isolation
to high-speed travel** In yet another instance of China\'s miraculous
rise in the tech world, high-speed rail ([HSR]{.underline}) [technology
and bullet trains are now almost instantly labeled Chinese
made]{.underline}, although it is actually China\'s fast-paced and
impressive progress in HSR technology that makes many forget that the
first HSR system began operations in Japan. The country\'s focus on
sharpening its edge in higher-end manufacturing arguably makes the case
for the HSR miracle, observers have said. Riding on an ultra-fast,
comfortable HSR from Shanghai to Beijing, Liu, a frequent traveler,
booked a food delivery via his smartphone one hour before the train
stopped for a few minutes at the station in Ji\'nan, capital of East
China\'s Shandong Province. Receiving a freshly made rice and meat set
meal from a restaurant outside the train carriage, Liu told the Global
Times how he marveled at the drastic changes of train technologies and
services. He still recalls the scene a decade ago when standing in the
train for a whole night, enduring its slow movement, and felt his feet
completely go numb on reaching the destination.\[graphic omitted\]Now
the Beijing-Shanghai HSR, one of China\'s busiest and fastest rail
lines, carried 1.35 billion passengers during its first decade of
operation, running a distance equivalent to approximately 40,000
revolutions around the globe. It takes only four and a half hours
between the two major cities, compared with nearly 17 hours in the 1980s
on the green-skinned train. By the end of 2020, the country had more
than 37,900 kilometers of HSR lines in service, the longest in the
world, according to China State Railway Group, the country\'s railway
operator. Marked as a historical breakthrough, the HSR demonstrated to
the world the country\'s growing technology prowess by mastering
technology in its own hands that was once held by Japan, Germany, and
France, as well as its increasing prosperity as the world\'s
second-largest economy. Not stopping its pursuit for more advanced HSR
technologies, [China is among the first in the world to introduce new
technology such as autonomous train operation]{.underline}, as evidenced
in the high-speed railway line connecting Beijing and Zhangjiakou, the
cities to co-host the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. With a maximum
design speed of 350 kilometers per hour (kph), the trains can
automatically start and stop, run between stations, open and close
doors, as well as handle emergencies, marking the first time China will
have had autonomous high-speed trains. To seek higher speed on land,
China\'s self-developed high-speed maglev transportation system running
at a speed of 600 kph debuted in Qingdao, East China\'s Shandong
Province, on July 20, which symbolized a cutting-edge scientific and
technological achievement in the field of rail transit. **Stamps to
facial scan** [China\'s spectacular march in artificial intelligence
over the past decade is surely another miracle that can\'t be overlooked
when gauging the country\'s technological revolution]{.underline} at a
much later stage of its xiaokang adventure, as the economy\'s transition
toward being innovation-oriented has prioritized AI, alongside big data
and cloud computing, among other emerging technologies, to power the
economic growth. As a consequence of the country\'s stunning leap toward
being a trendsetter in AI, face recognition-enabled ticket checking
machines have been deployed in a growing number of railway stations
across the country. Face recognition clocking in machines are also
becoming commonplace in the country.\[graphic omitted\] Thanks to
broad-base applications of AI technology into everyday life and the
workplace, [these [technological advancements helped in the quick and
effective tracing of virus infections]{.mark}, with the country ahead of
other major economies in emerging from the COVID-19
pandemic]{.underline}. In a sign of the country\'s fabulous stride from
a manufacturing hub to a global technology power into the future, China
holds 389,571 out of over 520,000 AI patent applications globally over
the past decade, according to findings in a report by the Tsinghua
University Artificial Intelligence Research Institute earlier this year.
The four Chinese AI heavyweights - Megvii, SenseTime Group, YITU
Technology, and CloudWalk - have also in recent years bagged numerous
world-class AI-related awards, notably in image recognition and
algorithm terms. The country has achieved a transition in AI
technologies development from a focus on basic research to the enabling
of its application into specific industries to AI functioning as
infrastructure, Sun Jian, chief scientist of Megvii, said at the AI
firm\'s tech open day in Beijing in mid-July. As part of efforts to
close China\'s gap with the US in the AI ecosystem, Megvii has unveiled
its proprietary open-source deep learning framework, MegEngine, as a
new, promising alternative to Google\'s TensorFlow and Facebook-backed
PyTorch. **Maps to navigation satellites** Last but not the least[, a
number of milestones China has hit in the aerospace spotlight the
country\'s enviable miracle in space technology]{.underline}, backed by
efforts of several generations of China\'s space industry experts to
turn the country into a space power. An autonomous driving car packed
with vegetables, fruits, and fresh seafood was driving to a residential
area in Beijing\'s Shunyi district in July 2020 when the coronavirus
epidemic put many people to stay at home. By receiving the signal of
BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), the driverless car could
adjust its route in real time operation while being guaranteed to stay
on the right track. \[graphic omitted\] It was just one of various
scenarios that the Chinese home-grown navigation system was applied to
in quotidian life. With the last BDS satellite successfully sent into
space in June 2020, it marked the completion of the country\'s
domestically developed BeiDou constellation. The satellite system has
now become part of usual technological advances in China in the space
area; however, it was hard to imagine how Chinese pioneers overcame
difficulties in extreme conditions to undertake \"mission impossible\"
back in the 1970s. With the familiar melody of \"Dongfanghong\", a
Chinese song that pays tribute to Chairman Mao, broadcasting from space,
China\'s first man-made satellite Dongfanghong-1 was successfully
launched in 1970. The launch was via China\'s own booster - Long March 1
rocket, making China the fifth nation to put a spacecraft into orbit
using its own rocket. By that moment, China had proved to the world that
it could realize what other foreign countries could. China\'s aerospace
development started late from a low point, but has achieved outstanding
progress in a short period of time. Through the efforts and
contributions of several generations of people engaging in the aerospace
cause, China has caught up with the world\'s other aerospace powers.
Following successful tests of its first atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb in
the 1960s, and the Dongfanghong-1 satellite, [China opened a new chapter
in space exploration]{.underline}, sending hundreds of self-developed
spacecrafts including man-made satellites, crewed spacecrafts, and space
probes. The space industry has produced a remarkable score over the past
two years characterized by the nation\'s first independent Mars mission
and the Chang\'e 5 mission that retrieved rock and soil samples from the
moon. The latest advance came as China sent three taikonauts into orbit
in June via the Shenzhou-12 spaceship, the first of four crewed space
flights to complete the country\'s space station by the end of 2022.

China will soon overtake the U.S. in areas like artificial
intelligence]{.underline} and autonomous vehicles. "[The Chinese
government and the Chinese tech leaders are marching in lockstep towards
innovation]{.underline}," he said on stage at an event hosted by The
Churchill Club. "So I think there's a real [risk that in three to five
years' time, we wake up and realize that China is far ahead of the
U.S.]{.underline} and Silicon Valley." The four other investors on stage
--- David Cowan from Bessemer, Sarah Guo from Greylock, Nicole Quinn
from Lightspeed and Tomasz Tunguz from Redpoint --- largely agreed with
Vernal's prediction. [In China, the government is eager to clear hurdles
for self-driving cars, data sharing, or factory automation]{.underline},
while start-ups in the U.S. get caught up in regulation, Vernal said.
Not only is [the Chinese government more aligned with the country's tech
sector]{.underline}, but [start-ups there have access to much larger
data sets to train their AI algorithms, due to both the size of the
population and fewer concerns or regulations around
privacy]{.underline}, added Tunguz. Each investor had to present two
technology trends that they thought would take off in three to five
years and this was one of Vernal's pitches: The only investor who didn't
agree with Vernal's prediction was Cowan, who argued that technology
isn't a winner-take-all situation and that innovation in China will
benefit economies and consumers everywhere. Guo rebuffed that notion.
"[Technology overall is not a zero-sum game]{.underline}, **[but for any
of the companies we invest in,]{.underline}** sometimes **[it
is]{.underline}**," she said. [Chinese start-ups relating to artificial
intelligence are already attracting more funding]{.underline}: T[hey
received 48 percent of global AI funding versus 38 percent in the
U.S]{.underline}., according to CB Insights. One way that Silicon Valley
could maintain its status as a global innovation hub is to continue to
make it a place where people from all around the world want to work, Guo
added. 'Wide-eyed optimism about China' Several of the VCs brought up
their opposition to President Donald Trump's immigration reform plans,
which could cause a brain drain in Silicon Valley. "This is not a
criticism about China --- it's wide-eyed optimism about China," Vernal
said. "It's more of a criticism of the U.S. I am deeply patriotic \...
but I fear that [China will become a more forward-leaning society and we
descend into bickering and complacency]{.underline}." Sequoia is
arguably Silicon Valley's most successful venture capital firm, having
invested in giants like Apple, Google, Oracle, YouTube and Yahoo over
its nearly five decades. Vernal joined in 2016 from Facebook, where he
spent more than eight years, most recently leading its search group. In
the early days of Facebook, the company resented the fast imitation of
social network knockoffs in Russia and China, he says, but now it's
looking with envy at China's extremely popular WeChat messaging app.
"Today, if you look at WhatsApp or Messenger, both of them pale in
comparison to WeChat, which is just a force to be beheld in China," he
said. "In many ways, the Messenger and WhatsApp teams wish they had
something as influential, and powerful, and ubiquitous as WeChat."
Another Sequoia partner, Mike Moritz, recently came under fire for an
opinion piece comparing Silicon Valley's work ethic unfavorably to
China's, where he says tech employees often work 10 hour days, six days
a week. Critics called his take tone deaf, and said it glorified
unhealthy work practices. Here's the full list of the top tech trends
that the VCs presented at the event: \[graphic omitted\]

#### China will win the race -- it's zero sum -- the AI lead snowballs

**[[America is Roadkill on China's Path to Artificial Intelligence
Dominance]{.mark}]{.underline}** "That's a dead armadillo," I said
pointing with my finger as my arm hung out the car door window. Back in
the day, my dad would take our family on vacation drives along iconic
Route 66. We drove for hours during the day, stopping at bizarre
roadside attractions, and sleeping the night in one of those TeePee
motels. Every summer it was the same drive. The same attractions. Same
lodging. The only thing that changed was the kind of roadkill, lifeless
flattened animal bodies, that my sister and I would try to identify as
we motored along. As much as they were all different, they were all the
same. Their tiny bodies were slower to move than the massive cars and
trucks plowing along the highway. They never had a chance. [America
faces a]{.underline} similar [challenge]{.underline} in our desire [to
navigate]{.underline} across the competitive roadscapes leading towards
[an artificially intelligent driven world.]{.underline} As a country,
America stands at the slide of a heavily travelled global AI highway,
tepidly stepping out into strategic traffic and then back onto the
tactical breakdown lane. Back to a slow pace and a safer place. All the
while, massive AI achievements are zipping by from other countries with
amazing speed. Pushing us further back onto the side of the road.
Keeping us from make our move. Giving us a false sense of safety. All
the while keeping us from a lumbering move that would most likely have
us end up like the dead armadillo of my childhood day. [[America
is]{.underline}]{.mark} dangerously [[lagging]{.mark} other parts of the
world when it comes to]{.underline} treating [AI]{.underline} as a
strategic asset. For example, [China seeks to dominate]{.underline} the
global AI industry. We do not. They are treating development of AI as an
arms race, building massive government supported industries that drive
toward their strategic endgame -- own AI, around the world, and have the
resources to support it. We have no stated strategy. To support their
strategic goals, [[to win the inevitable **zero sum** competitive games
with America]{.underline}, [China has]{.underline}]{.mark} release [[a
national AI development strategy]{.mark}.]{.underline} This set of
capabilities, partners, and alliances that will guide their goals to
develop a China-centric \$23B AI industry by 2020 and a \$59B industry
by 2025. Local and state governments are also supporting this strategy,
creating educational and delivery alliance partners. China's 1.4 billion
population is a data gold mine for building AI. For China, this is
national strategic initiative. **[A Pax Americana of Asia
AI.]{.underline}** We don't have one. They do. That's an America
problem. A strategic problem. Lack of a national strategic program is
important because AI is a unique strategic resource. It is not like oil,
water, or food. Traditional strategic resources do not beget more of
those resource. Having a reserve of oil does not in itself generate more
oil. These resources are finite and consumed. AI is different. [AI
produces more AI.]{.underline} AI is an exothermic resource, generating
more than it consumes. [It produces more knowledge, more insights, more
advantages]{.underline} for the user. [Having a strategic AI lead means
one can produce more AI]{.underline} in the future, [faster than those
that don't have it]{.underline} or are just starting. John Boyd, a
United States Air Force Colonel, studies the tactical effects of
strategically out thinking your enemy. He determined that **[[when one
operates at a faster tempo]{.mark} or rhythm than the adversary, [you
will win and they lose in a zero sum competitive game]{.mark}. [AI is a
catalyst]{.mark} for faster tempos and rhythms]{.underline}.** But
unlike other processes, like the OODA that Boyd studied, AI
exponentially improves its results with each cycle, each evolution. This
limits effective counter attacks, limits effective transformations that
could equalize future competitive engagements. He who owns AI, owns the
world.

### 2nc \-\-- Generic China Heg Inevitable

#### As American heg declines China rises.

Affairs Volume 21, Issue 1, "The new world \[dis\] order in the
complexity of America's hegemonic decline and the configuration of new
power patterns," https://doi.org/10.1002/pa.2114//ZW\]

2.3 [Symptoms of USA hegemonic decline]{.underline}: A critical analysis
of the emergence of BRICS, EU and the nuclear weaponry headache The
[contemporary time is characterized by the rise of China in the
international system]{.underline}. Based on Waldron (2005), The Asian
tiger ([China]{.underline})[\'s military and economic advancement are
transforming the entire structure of the international politics and
economics]{.underline}. As such, [its vast economic expansion and rapid
infrastructural establishments are both provenance of
Western]{.underline} and Japanese [concerns]{.underline}. Thus, [this is
mainly led by the Chinese quest for natural resources and mineral
resources and also their policy of no strings attached positioning on
their financial aid]{.underline} (Brautigam & Xiaoyang, 2012). **[The
Pentagon had also recognized China as the only country in the world to
be able to challenge the US hegemony]{.underline}** in the international
system (Chen & Feffer, 2009, p. 48). The ensuing reasons behind these
are: in 2015, [China introduced the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank
to counter the US engagement in monopolizing the global lending system
through the World Bank]{.underline} (WB) and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) (Elsinga, 2015; Shangai, 2014). [China]{.underline} had also
[demonstrated]{.underline} its [interest in overtaking and exercising
dominion over global connections by erecting the "New Silk
Road"]{.underline} which runs between Western Europe and Asia with
maritime and continental routes (Monteleone, 2018). [These maritime
routes are used by China to explore the world to significant
markets]{.underline} like Greece\'s Piraeus and Gwadar\'s Pakistan and
they are also used for the organization- facilitation between the
peripheries and the core world (Komlosy, 2016). In spite of the attempts
to establish and sustain "Eurasian Economic Union" by Russia, this will
still be beneficial to China as Russia has welcomed with both hands,
Chinese investment and loans in mining, pipelines as well as transport
infrastructure (Kenton, 2018). [China has also invaded the international
areas of healthcare, medicine, life art, tourism and
cooking]{.underline} (Komlosy, 2016). One important point to add is
China\'s rise with manufacturing Multinational Corporations (MNCs) which
often outperform USA MNCs is another problem to consider (Griffiths &
Luciani, 2011; Knight, 2014). [Projections show that the Asian tiger is
anticipated to overtake the USA economically by 2041]{.underline}
(Knight, 2014). Despite the role of China in being the leading figure in
the discussion of the challenging the USA hegemony, the BRICS countries
at large are also engaged in efforts of countering the USA dominance of
international finance. Relevant example include that they were able to
launch a New Development Bank (NDB) in 2017. This has another important
emerging power pattern found in BRICS, particularly as it relates to the
International finance (Ernstzen, 2015). This emerging international
economic Power Pattern had also invested heavily in the property
investment esp. in the former industrialized countries (Komlosy, 2016).
BRICS is also anticipated to overtake and out-perform the combination of
the United Kingdom (UK), Germany, France, Italy and Japan by at least
the late 2030s (Kim, 2010). [A number of trade agreements have also been
established in Latin America to counter the US hegemony]{.underline}
over trade such as the Bolivian Alternative of Americas (ALBA) to
counter USA\'s hegemony over the Caribbean and Latin America\'s
perpetuated trade hegemony (Fox, 2019). Equally important is the EU,
which instituted the Euro to counter the dollar (Lioudis, 2018). This
has encouraged organizations such as the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to attempt to substitute the US Dollar with
EU\'s Euro (Knight, 2014). Knight (2014) further argues that the
emergence of competing blocs in the international system has led to the
establishments of EU and the schemes of Regional Integration (RI) in
Europe. Thus, this contributes immensely to trade weakening between USA
and Europe, which results in the weakening of the US dollar too. Besides
the EU, the tactical Nuclear Weapons inclination depicted by North
Korea, Russia, Pakistan and Israel worries USA because they are attested
to have a lot of nuclear weapons and may continually develop more if
they are not monitored and if they are serious about overthrowing USA\'s
hegemony. The actual reality is that more Nuclear warheads are possessed
by Russia now more than the USA and this has placed the USA on a
security risk (Lockie, 2016). In the year 2014, 8,000 nuclear weapons
were recorded by Russia with only 7,300 recorded by the USA (Nersisyan,
2016).

#### China rise is inevitable\-\-- it's only a question of how the US reacts.

[For many observers outside China]{.underline}, especially in the US,
[there is no doubt that China is bent on replacing America as the
dominant power]{.underline} in the world (Mosher 2000). Indeed, for some
observers[, China's elites are following nothing less than a 100-year
plan to replace the US as the world's dominant power]{.underline}
(Pillsbury 2015). Prominent [realist scholars worry that there is a
certain structurally determined inevitability about both China's
rise]{.underline} and the [chances of a conflict between the US and the
PRC as the latter increasingly seeks to assert its growing power and
influence]{.underline} (Allison 2017). While Western IR's collective
failure to predict the end of the Cold War, the dramatic decline in
inter-state wars, or recognise the importance of national strategic
cultures and beliefs in shaping thinking about security, suggests that
[we should be very cautious about its collective epistemic
authority]{.underline}, there is no doubt that China's behaviour has
changed. [One of the most important expressions of this possibility can
be seen in the sophistication of China's political and diplomatic elites
as they have come to play a more prominent part in]{.underline} what
some IR theorists describe as '[international society']{.underline} and
the institutional architecture that constitutes it (Clark 2014). At one
level, hopes and expectations about China's leaders being 'socialised'
into the ways of Western diplomacy have been realised: China is nothing
like the disruptive, revolutionary force that it was under before
Richard M. Nixon and Henry Kissinger engineered the celebrated
rapprochement with the PRC (Kissinger 1994; van Ness 1970). At another
level, however, [it is clear that China's foreign policy goals continue
to reflect 'national interests']{.underline} and values, [especially
under the]{.underline} increasingly coordinated and [centralised
leadership of Xi]{.underline} Jinping (Lampton 2015). Indeed, not only
are Chinese policymakers still pursuing national goals, but they are
doing so in ways that are also often strikingly similar to those
employed by the US in an earlier era.

#### Increasing competition with China increases the risk of war -- rivalry ends only with one side [acceding]{.underline} to the leadership of the other

**Heath and Thompson, 18** - Timothy R. Heath is a Senior Defense and

experience as a China analyst in the U.S. government; William R.

In sum, [the rivalry between China and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [will likely continue until one country concludes
that it cannot win the competition and accedes to the leadership of the
other.]{.underline} [Another possibility is that **one side concludes
that the other side has lost the ability to compete**]{.underline} or no
longer threatens the other. [This has historically been the norm for
rivalries that evade]{.underline} or survive decisive [combat, and there
is little reason to expect the current U.S.-China rivalry to end
differently]{.underline}.69 Sino-U.S. strategic competition is here to
stay, and it could last many years, potentially even decades.

Aggressive Competitive Approaches Are Counterproductive

If rivalry is unavoidable, should the United States adopt a posture of
aggressive competition or even war? John Mearsheimer has argued that
"war with China is inevitable" and recommended a strategy of containment
accordingly. He has acknowledged that such a strategy would result in an
aggravation of security competition dynamics but stated that this is an
unavoidable "self-fulfilling prophecy."70 Some political leaders and
analysts have similarly argued that competition is unavoidable and
advocated for punishing measures designed to humiliate or weaken
China.71

As Mearsheimer's invocation of terms that evoke the Cold War
"containment" strategy suggests, the advocacy of aggressive competitive
strategies mistakenly assumes that all rivalries share the same levels
of hostility and threat. In reality, not all rivalries are alike. [Those
rivalries that carry high levels of hostility, threat, and competition
tend to feature high risks of conflict]{.underline}. The last major
strategic rivalry that the United States faced, with the Soviet Union,
was an example of this hostile, dangerous variation. Although in the
Cold War the U.S. and Soviet militaries did not clash in a large-scale
war, they frequently fought proxy conflicts around the world. The two
countries also developed massive nuclear arsenals as part of a larger
competition for influence and status in Europe and elsewhere, greatly
adding to a sense of mutual vulnerability, threat, and hostility.

The U.S.-China rivalry lacks a great deal of the ideological dogma that
helped make the Cold War a zero-sum contest. The rivalry retains the
democratic-authoritarian cleavage of its predecessor but lacks the
Manichean quality of a showdown between good and evil that suffused the
U.S.-Soviet rivalry. [While Washington and Beijing compete for
international audiences]{.underline}, so far [the competition is much
more muted and is centered on various aspects of an international order
to which both states remain largely committed.]{.underline} [China's
economy is also far more integrated with the U.S. economy]{.underline}
(and, again, vice versa) than was ever the case in the U.S.-Soviet
relationship during the Cold War. Economic interdependence can be a
powerful constraint and is an unusually distinctive characteristic of
the current Sino-U.S. rivalry, even though the possibility of more
acrimonious trade relations looms and there remains the risk that
competition will trump interdependence or worsen the rivalry as both
sides attempt to produce the same types of goods.72 Both countries have
also seen large exchanges of people and culture, another important
difference from the Cold War. And unlike the Soviet Union, China has
shown a much greater willingness to cooperate with the United States on
shared challenges, such as climate change, disaster relief, and maritime
piracy.

[These differences suggest that the U.S. rivalry with China has the
potential to remain at a less dangerous, violent level than was the case
with the U.S.-Soviet rivalry. Policies that aim to replicate Cold War
strategies thus are not appropriate because they assume a higher level
of enmity, threat, and competition]{.underline} than what currently
exists. Indeed, policies that focus on containing or subverting the
adversary, or that aim to mobilize the public against China, risk
driving the rivalry to resemble the more antagonistic, dangerous variety
of the Cold War. Similarly, actions that unnecessarily antagonize China
by suggesting it is a country that cannot be trusted or with which
cooperation is pointless carry the same perils. [The current
rivalry]{.underline}, troublesome as it is, [could be made much worse by
aggravating perceptions of hostility and threat. Because the potential
for crisis and conflict increase when bilateral relations become
characterized by high degrees of enmity, threat, and competition,
confrontational Cold War--style policies are likely to exacerbate the
rivalry and elevate the risk of war]{.underline}.

#### [China rise]{.underline} and [US decline]{.underline} is inevitable but clinging to the squo causes a [violent transition]{.underline}

China's new assertiveness and the sudden inward turn of the United
States are a function of causes located in both the second and third
images. The key second- image variable is nationalism, which combines
with [the power trajectories]{.underline} (a third-image variable) of
both China and the United States to [define]{.underline} **[how their
relationship will unfold]{.underline}** in the coming years. The
[interaction between nationalism and power trajectory
produces]{.underline} **[entirely different foreign policy
orientations]{.underline}** [in ris- ing and declining
powers]{.underline}---the former [embraces an outward-looking,
extroverted foreign policy of expansion]{.underline}, while the [latter
adopts an inward-looking, intro- verted foreign policy of **restraint
and retrenchment**]{.underline}.

Why the focus on nationalism? [Nationalism provides a natural complement
to structural realist theory;]{.underline} it is rightly viewed as
realism's domestic-level counter- part.3 The [constant struggle among
nations]{.underline} over issues of power, security, and prestige that
[animates realism is in no small part a consequence of
nationalism]{.underline}, which 'fuels interstate rivalry and by its
sharp delineation of in- and out-groups, abets status rivalry,
accentuates stereotyping, and deepens and perpetuates per- ceived
grievances.'4 This seems obvious enough.

Thus, [a rising power]{.underline}---especially late in its development
when its economic and military power begin to approach that of the top
dog in the system---[becomes]{.underline} **[more
assertive]{.underline}** [in pressing its status claims and
grievances]{.underline}. This [cannot help but foment **domestic
nationalism**]{.underline}, [as the public becomes either]{.underline}:
(i) frustrate**[d that the established powers are treating the country
with disrespect]{.underline}** [by denying it the global influence it
deserves or]{.underline} (ii) [emboldened by concessions granted by the
established powers that allow expansion to proceed
unabated]{.underline}. Moreover, [leaders]{.underline} of rising powers
[often whip up **domestic nationalism**]{.underline} to [back their
expansionist policies]{.underline} and/[or to divert the public's
dissatisfaction]{.underline} [with the pace of internal
reforms]{.underline} and economic progress.

Less intuitively, [nationalism]{.underline} **[can also support a policy
of hegemonic retrenchment]{.underline}**---[redeploying military forces
offshore,]{.underline} [demanding that allies pay more for their
defense, and reassessing trade agreemen]{.underline}ts through a
mercantilist lens with the aim of achieving favorable trade balances.
Because of [the redistribu- tion of power]{.underline}, the [costs to
the declining hegemon]{.underline} of [managing the international system
increase relative to its capacity to p]{.underline}ay. The problem
becomes, as Walter Lippmann characterized it, the balancing of
commitments and resources.5 An [important means of bringing costs and
resources into balance]{.underline} is to [reduce over- seas
commitment]{.underline}s---that is, political, economic, or military
retrenchment---either by passing the 'balancing' buck to one's allies
(insisting on greater burden-sharing within the alliance[), by
unilaterally abandoning commitments]{.underline}, by seeking rap-
prochement [with less threatening, secondary rivals, by attempting to
appease the rising power,]{.underline} or by some combination thereof.6
[All of these policies fit within the larger context of global
retreat]{.underline}---of a [weary titan coming home]{.underline}. The
natural com- plement to this grand strategy is a [xenophobic nationalism
rooted in the rallying cry of 'we must do more for ourselves and less
for othe]{.underline}rs, who should learn to take care of themselves and
solve their own problems'---the opposite, it should be noted, of 'the
proper maxim of an unchallenged number one': 'Do good for others in
order to do well for yourself.'7

Most important, [the resurgent nationalisms of the rising challenger and
the declining hegemon]{.underline} are **[entirely
compatible]{.underline}** [with a future relationship character- ized
**by peace and harmony**]{.underline}. Obviously, [the two
nationalisms]{.underline} **[pose no inherent conflict]{.underline}** of
interests: [China currently wants more global influence; the United
States wants less]{.underline}. Hence, there is good [reason to expect
a]{.underline} **[soft landing]{.underline}** [as the world moves from
unipolarity to bipolarity]{.underline}. Indeed, the [future may well
resemble]{.underline} President [Xi]{.underline} Jinping's [proposal for
a '**new type of great power relations'**]{.underline} (xinxing daguo
guanxi), [the idea that China and the United States should share global
leadership]{.underline} as equals [and break a historical pattern of
inevitable confrontation]{.underline} between rising and established
powers.8 There [is room in Asia for two great powers to **coexist and
cooperate**]{.underline}, in Xi's opinion, as long as they treat each
other as equals.9

[Emerging powers]{.underline} are **[expected to be
outward-looking]{.underline}**, t[o show competitive inter- national
faces]{.underline}, to **[expand when and where they can.]{.underline}**
Throughout history, it has been a commonly held belief that [demographic
and economic growth must]{.underline}, **[like a]{.underline}**n
irresistible **[law of nature]{.underline}**, [lead to]{.underline}
**[territorial growth and the enhancement of the country's political
influence in other regions]{.underline}**. [Self-interest obliges
leaders of rising states]{.underline} [to take advantage of
opportunitie]{.underline}s to **[augment their countries
influence]{.underline}**, power, and status, but not recklessly. In
other words, rational leaders will try to avoid expansion and imperial
ambitions that risk triggering the formation of powerful
counter-coalitions.

Nevertheless, resistance to its prestige and status demands---that is,
pushback by the existing Great Powers---is fully anticipated and
expected. [A rising power]{.underline} [**demands its rightful place in
the sun** knowing]{.underline} that [the established Great Powers who
created the existing order are unlikely to concede the prestige,
territory, and privileges they enjoy]{.underline} under the current
system. Hence, rising powers are often portrayed as troublesome
states---as revisionist challengers seeking to expand their political
and military influence by hook or by crook at the expense of the old
guard. Just as the need to expand appears to be in logic of a nation's
develop- ment, the impulse to oppose such expansion appears to be in the
logic of a hegemon's decline. These two logics combine to drive a
narrative of encirclement within the emerging power---one in which the
older and stronger nation(s) seek to stranle the new and rising one
before it is too late. All this is fertile soil for the growth within
the rising power of a powerful brand of nationalism that looks outward.

This is not to suggest that emerging powers are wholly distracted by
external opportunities. Like all states, rising powers are Janus-faced,
looking inward as well as outward. After all, sudden and dramatic
national growth induces massive social and political dislocations. As a
nation grows, therefore, it becomes increas- ingly essential for its
rulers to continuously mediate between their national soci- eties and
the international economy---to recalibrate periodically the balance
between citizens, states, and markets as they simultaneously encourage
stable and sustained growth.

[Within rising powers]{.underline}, **[outward-looking
nationalism]{.underline}** [is a natural response to the country's
**exalted growth and the national pride**]{.underline} and patriotism
that it inspires among its citizens. That said, there are two other more
devious and less straight- forward ways that outward-looking nationalism
can arise (or rather, be whipped up by elites) and be used for domestic
purposes. First, consistent with the diversionary theory of war, [it
**redirects**]{.underline} the [public's attention from]{.underline}
**[internal troubles and the regime's failures]{.underline}**---[in
China's case, official corruption, lack of political reform, pollution,
youth unemployment, and a woefully inefficient capital
market]{.underline} due to stalled reforms that would transform China's
dominant state-owned banks into commercial banks---**[to external
opportunities and to enemies]{.underline}** (an out-group), real or
imagined, who are preventing the emerging power from harvesting those
benefits. Second, as Jack Snyder argued, nationalism centered on
(imperial) expansion---whether territorial, economic, political, or any
combination there- of---may arise as a rationalization 'for the
interests of groups that derive parochial benefits from expansion, from
military preparations associated with expansion, or from the domestic
political climate brought about by intense international competition'.33

Consistent with this logic, [many observers believe]{.underline} that,
since 2010, **[Beijing has been pursuing its territorial ambitions more
aggressively.]{.underline}** China s[eeks to assert territorial
sovereignty and maritime jurisdiction]{.underline} over the bulk of the
South China Seas---between roughly 62% and 90% of this sea. Combined,
[Chinese territorial and maritime demands stretch more than 800 nautical
miles]{.underline} from the Chinese island province of Hainan and
encompass islands, rocks, reefs, and waters claimed by Vietnam, the
Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia. Moreover, China has
[created more than 3200 acres of territory between 2013 and
2015---]{.underline} acreage that amounts to nearly 17 times more land
creation in two years than all of the other claimant states combined in
the past forty years.34 China's ability to station its missiles, fighter
jets, and strategic bombers on these artificial islands makes them
tantamount to a fleet of 'unsinkable aircraft carriers'.35 In the East
China Seas, China has repeatedly prompted 'incidents' in the
Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands. As a result, Sino-Japanese distrust has reached
new heights, reflecting the insecurities felt by both countries as they
contemplate their respective positions in Asia. China is also expanding
its influence in the areas of global finance, trade, and aid. As the
United States under Donald Trump retreats from globalization, especially
from international trade agreements that fail to deliver short-term US
trade surpluses, [China has dedicated itself]{.underline} to the
opposite strategy: [making]{.underline} **[long- term investments with
the aim of supplanting the United States as the world's dominant
power]{.underline}**.36 Key to this plan is China's new 'One Belt, One
Road' strategy. Launched by President Xi Jinping in 2013 to improve
links between Beijing and its neighbors within Eurasia, the 'Belt and
Road' strategy will make it possible for China to become the economic
center of all of Eurasia. This is no fantasy. Witness the Chinese
government's January 2017 launch of a rail freight service between China
and London. Traversing Asia and Europe, the Beijing--London rail link,
the first of its kind, is just one of China's growing portfolio of rail
con- nections. There are presently 39 lines that connect 12 European
cities with 16 Chinese cities.37

For maritime transport, [China is developing new seaports]{.underline}
in the Indian Ocean and has purchased the port of Piraeus in Greece,
which it is expanding to serve as the hub of a transport network of
China-built rail lines reaching from Greece into Hungary and then
throughout Europe. This maritime trade route is being pro- tected by
China's fast-expanding blue-water navy, new air and naval bases built on
reefs in the South China Sea, and China's first overseas military base
in Djibouti, which guards the Red Sea and Suez routes to the Piraeus.
Moreover, this vast continent-wide construction venture is being
financed mainly by loans from China to other countries---loans that will
bind recipient countries to China for a generation. Through these
infrastructure projects and the construction of an alternative global
architecture, most notably in the area of global finance and credit with
the new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), China---like the
United States in the years after World War II---is spinning its economic
power into a global web of finance, construction, and trade, [making it
possible for China to become the economic center of all
Eurasia]{.underline}.38

[Explanations of]{.underline} China's new
**[assertiveness]{.underline}** have [focused on]{.underline} both
**[international structure and China's domestic politics]{.underline}**,
that is, on both third-image and second- image causes. Regarding
international structure, pundits claim that, [in the wake of the 2008
financial crisis]{.underline}, **[Chinese leaders perceived a dramatic
shift in the global balance of power]{.underline}**---[an
**unprecedented transfer of power**]{.underline} and wealth from West to
East and South.39 [The perceived decline]{.underline} **[of American
power]{.underline}** [and onset of a more multipolar world,]{.underline}
so the argument goes, **[have emboldened Chinese leaders to be 'more
confident]{.underline}** in ignoring Deng Xiaoping's longtime axiom not
to treat the United States as an adversary, and in challenging the
United States on China's interests'.40 Here, China's new assertiveness
is consistent with the classical realist principle that [nations expand
their political interests]{.underline} abroad **[when their relative
power increases]{.underline}**. Or as Robert Gilpin explains the dynamic
correlation between power and the national interest: 'The Realist law of
uneven growth implies that as the power of a group or state increases,
that group or state will be tempted to try to increase its control over
the environment. In order to increase its own secur- ity, it will try to
expand its political, economic, and territorial control, it will try to
change the international system in accordance with its particular set of
inter- ests.'41 In this view, [China's new assertiveness is a
predictable consequence of its]{.underline} changed (more
[exalted]{.underline}) [position within the international
system.]{.underline}

Relatedly, Suisheng Zhao argues that China's post-2008 'strident turn'
is explained by the convergence of Chinese state nationalism and popular
national- ism calling for a more muscular Chinese foreign policy:
'[Enjoying an inflated sense of empowerment supported by its new
quotient of wealth and military capacities]{.underline}, and [terrified
of an uncertain future]{.underline} due to increasing social, economic
and political tensions at home, [the communist state has become more
willing to play to the **popular nationalist gallery**]{.underline} [in
pursuing the so-called core national interests.]{.underline}'42 Such
[popular nationalism]{.underline} in China is [very much a product of
the country's historical legacy]{.underline} 'of a [long and glorious
past, unjust treatment at the hands of foreigners]{.underline} from 1840
to 1949 (and beyond), [a desire to regain]{.underline} **[interna-
tional respect and equality,]{.underline}** an imperative for
territorial reunification, and a [wish to reaffirm their **collective
greatness as a people and nation'**]{.underline}.43 A shared sense of
shame and humiliation with respect to China's experience of having been
a play- ground of foreign (Western and Japanese) intervention and
**[encroachment is particularly a potent driver of Chinese
nationalism]{.underline}** and its current behavior.44 Indeed, shame has
been a stimulant, a call to action, for generations of Chinese leaders
and intellectuals. Though it may sound odd to most Western ears, feeling
shame was (and remains) the path to escape the bitter reality of China's
humiliat- ing past. 'To feel shame is to approach courage,' reads an
inscription in the Temple of Tranquil Seas in Nanjing, where China
signed one of its most unequal treaties with a foreign power. China
'carries the self-image of a "victim nation," albeit a nation with
aspirations finally on a path toward greatness restored. This victim
complex, coupled with China's aspirations and growing power, creates a
sense of entitlement---a combination that makes Beijing prickly in its
dealing with the United States' and its neighbors.45

We see this cantankerous and touchy mood not only in Beijing's
increasingly tough diplomacy but in the violent demonstrations over the
past several years staged by Chinese nationalists against Japanese
companies with operations in China, causing some of those companies to
relocate to Vietnam. Today, more than ever, Chinese public displays of
nationalism and outrage---whether set off by perceived unfair treatment
by the West, US--South Korea naval exercises, or insults from the
Japanese---appear genuine rather than manufactured. Moreover, whereas
nationalism was traditionally confined primarily to young Chinese and to
some soldiers in the People's Liberation Army (PLA), it has spread to
Chinese businesspeople, academics, and elite politicians.46 This
diffusion of Chinese nationalism is the product of China's rise and its
domestic political system becom- ing more participative, with different
factions fighting among each other, and China's public sphere growing
more dynamic, fueled by the Internet and social media. 'Beyond the
party's control,' notes Jayshree Bajoria, 'the emergence of the Internet
in the last two decades has given nationalists more power to vent their
anger after particular incidents. It has also brought the huge Chinese
diaspora in places like Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Europe,
and North America, into closer contact with those residing within
China's borders', facilitating the contin- uous flow and escalation of
nationalist rhetoric and propaganda.47 And because social media can be
used to organize large-scale, nationalist protests in Beijing and other
cities against foreign governments, the continued expansion of informa-
tion technologies throughout the population promises to accentuate the
role of nationalism in Chinese policymaking; it also threatens to raise
Chinese national- ism to dangerous and unstable levels of
hypernationalism.48

[Given China's determination to avenge its past]{.underline}, **[there
is every reason to expect that Chinese nationalism will continue to
grow]{.underline}** [in lockstep with the country's]{.underline}
**[increased power]{.underline}**. This [phenomenon]{.underline} is
[already evident among Chinese policy- makers]{.underline}, military
officials, and average citizens. The [consensus is that China must
eventually]{.underline} **[become more internationally
assertive]{.underline}** [to the point where]{.underline} it, like the
United States, [is willing to intervene in the domestic affairs of other
countries]{.underline} to protect its far-flung interests abroad.49
Moreover, some suggest that the goal of global dominance lies at the
core of China's journey from humiliation to rejuve- nation. The notion
of national rejuvenation, according to the conservative Chinese analyst
Yan Xuetong, 'conjures "the psychological power" associated with China's
rise "to its former world status". The concept assumes both that China
is recovering its natural position and that this means being the "number
one nation in the world"'.50

#### High economy makes China global leader for norms.

https://www.voanews.com/a/chinas-economy-could-overtake-us-economy-by-2030/6380892.html//ZW\]

SAN FRANCISCO --- [China's economy will increasingly rely on state
investment, high-tech development and domestic consumption]{.underline}
-- with less input from its past staple of export manufacturing -- as it
[stands to overtake the United States in the coming decade]{.underline},
analysts predict. [China's GDP should grow 5.7% per year through
2025]{.underline} and then [4.7% annually until 2030]{.underline},
British consultancy Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR)
forecasts. Its forecast says that [China]{.underline}, now the world's
second-largest economy, [would overtake the No. 1-ranked U.S. economy by
2030]{.underline}. Credit insurance firm Euler Hermes made a similar
forecast. Chinese leaders have pushed over the past decade to rely more
on value-added services over traditional factory exports, state media
have said. The Sino-U.S. trade dispute and early 2020 workplace closures
due to COVID-19 have added pressure on manufacturing. Reducing factory
output in China, foreign multinationals have been expanding outside
China, targeting places such as Vietnam to avoid rising wages and
environmental compliance costs. By offshoring in multiple countries they
hope to head off any repeat of China\'s early 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns
that shut down factories. [China's economy totaled \$15.92 trillion in
2020, and market research firm IHS Markit estimates that it reached \$18
trillion last year on export manufacturing growth and capital for new
projects]{.underline}. [The U.S. economy reached about \$23 trillion
last year]{.underline}, the market research firm said. **State
investment** [The country that's already known for fast economic growth
over the past 20 years would see the state take more control over key
sectors after intervening in several,]{.underline} including the
internet, in 2021, economists expect. "Beijing has the funds and the
unfettered domestic political power to use China's large public treasury
to make strategic investments in the service of the leadership's
national and global objectives," said Denny Roy, senior fellow at the
East-West Center think tank in Honolulu. [China scored 2.98 in 2018, up
from 2.45 eight years earlier and approaching about three times the
world average]{.underline}, on the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation Development policy forum's Direct Control Over Enterprises
index. That [means the government's direct control over enterprises
"well exceeded the open economy average"]{.underline} and "[reflects
China's increasing emphasis on the role of the state in the economy
under Xi Jinping]{.underline}," the think tank Atlantic Council says in
its October report China Pathfinder: Annual Scorecard . **Growth in tech
hardware** [Chinese leaders will probably prioritize tech]{.underline},
especially hardware that does not require constant innovation, [as a
growth engine]{.underline}, economists say. [State intervention in the
internet sector won\'t hobble expansion in semiconductors and
infrastructure software]{.underline}, said Zennon Kapron, founder and
director of the Shanghai-based financial industry research firm
Kapronasia. "[If the country does become self-sufficient in terms of
technology and then is able to sell and export those products and
services that are based on the technology, then that would be a huge
bump to its economy]{.underline}, because \[that\] is a key driver
certainly of the U.S. GDP now," Kapron said[. The U.S. economy will keep
growing but without spurts through 2030]{.underline}, Kapron predicts.
[China has a "huge base of engineers,"]{.underline} albeit less
creativity than it needs to foster the "zany ideas" that drive
development of new technology, said Douglas McWilliams, founder and
executive deputy chairman of CEBR. **Consumer spending** [Domestic
spending has driven most of China's economic growth]{.underline} before
2021 as the country reduced its exposure to the world in view of the
Sino-U.S. trade dispute, McKinsey & Co. says in its China consumer
report 2021. [Supply chains have "matured and localized, and its
innovation capabilities were enhanced]{.underline}" in turn, McKinsey &
Co says. That [trend is likely to continue despite hits to income under
lockdowns]{.underline} during the first year of COVID-19, analysts say.
[China's population exceeds that of the United States by 3.5 times,
though American consumers are wealthier on average]{.underline}. "In the
past five years, [domestic consumption has ... become a more significant
growth driver as China's domestic consumer market has grown dramatically
in size]{.underline}," said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist
with IHS Markit. Beijing's leadership "aims to create more than 11
million new urban jobs and expand domestic demand and effective
investment," the official Xinhua News Agency said in mid-2021. Those
measures, it said, "are expected to put the economy firmly back to
pre-pandemic vibrancy." **What if China overtakes US economy?** Status
as the world's largest economy does not confer any automatic advantages
over others, economists said, but [countries dependent on the Chinese
economy would take note]{.underline}. "There is no gold medal or
anything like that," CEBR's McWilliams told VOA. "But **[when you've got
more money to spend, you do have the ability to influence
things]{.underline}**, and **[China will have that ability to influence
things]{.underline}**." [China would be better placed]{.underline}, he
said, [to advance its Belt and Road Initiative]{.underline}, a
9-year-old effort aimed at building land and sea trade routes through
Asia, Europe and Africa in the form of infrastructure projects and
investments. Officials in Beijing are already [leveraging their economy
in disputes with other countries]{.underline}, said Roy of the East-West
Center. China vies with four Southeast Asian governments over maritime
sovereignty, contests a group of islets with Japan and has gotten into
territorial standoffs with India since 2017. "[The result of that
expectation]{.underline} (China surpassing the United States
economically) [has been a bolder PRC]{.underline} (People\'s Republic of
China) [foreign policy that seeks to settle regional disputes in China's
favor]{.underline} and to [de-legitimize U.S]{.underline}. regional and
[global leadership under the assumption that China is destined to set
the new rules of international relations]{.underline}," Roy said.

#### A hegemonic transition's inevitable -- US retrenchment and Chinese economic growth make a [soft landing]{.underline} likely

**Schweller, 18** - Randall Schweller is Professor of Political Science
and a Social and Behavioral Sciences Joan N. Huber Faculty Fellow, The
Ohio State University ("Opposite but Compatible Nationalisms: A
Neoclassical Realist Approach to the Future of US--China Relations" The
Chinese Journal of International Politics, 2018, 23--48 doi:
10.1093/cjip/poy003

[China's new assertiveness and the sudden inward turn of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [are a function of]{.underline}
causes located in both the second and third images. The key secondimage
variable is nationalism, which combines with the power trajectories (a
third-image variable) of both China and the United States to define how
their relationship will unfold in the coming years. The interaction
between [nationalism and power trajectory]{.underline} produces entirely
different foreign policy orientations in rising and [declining
powers]{.underline}---the former embraces an outward-looking,
extroverted foreign policy of expansion, while the latter
[adopt]{.underline}s [an inward-looking, introverted foreign policy of
restraint and retrenchment.]{.underline}

Why the focus on nationalism? Nationalism provides a natural complement
to structural realist theory; it is rightly viewed as realism's
domestic-level counterpart.3 The constant struggle among nations over
issues of power, security, and prestige that animates realism is in no
small part a consequence of nationalism, which 'fuels interstate rivalry
and by its sharp delineation of in- and out-groups, abets status
rivalry, accentuates stereotyping, and deepens and perpetuates perceived
grievances.'4 This seems obvious enough.

Thus, [a rising power]{.underline}---especially late in its development
[when its economic and military power begin to approach that of the top
dog]{.underline} in the system---[becomes more assertive in pressing its
status claims and grievances]{.underline}. [This cannot help but foment
domestic nationalism]{.underline}, as the public becomes either: (i)
frustrated that the established powers are treating the country with
disrespect by denying it the global influence it deserves or (ii)
emboldened by concessions granted by the established powers that allow
expansion to proceed unabated. Moreover, leaders of rising powers often
whip up domestic nationalism to back their expansionist policies and/or
to divert the public's dissatisfaction with the pace of internal reforms
and economic progress.

Less intuitively, [nationalism can also support a policy of hegemonic
retrenchment---redeploying military forces offshore, demanding that
allies pay more for their defense, and reassessing trade
agreements]{.underline} through a mercantilist lens with the aim of
achieving favorable trade balances. Because of the redistribution of
power, [the costs to the declining hegemon of managing the international
system increase relative to its capacity to pay]{.underline}. The
problem becomes, as Walter Lippmann characterized it, the balancing of
commitments and resources.5 An important means of bringing costs and
resources into balance is to reduce overseas commitments---that is,
political, economic, or military retrenchment---either by passing the
'balancing' buck to one's allies (insisting on greater burden-sharing
within the alliance), by unilaterally abandoning commitments, by seeking
rapprochement with less threatening, secondary rivals, by attempting to
appease the rising power, or by some combination thereof.6 All of these
policies fit within the larger context of global retreat---of a weary
titan coming home. The natural complement to this grand strategy is a
xenophobic nationalism rooted in the rallying cry of 'we must do more
for ourselves and less for others, who should learn to take care of
themselves and solve their own problems'---the opposite, it should be
noted, of 'the proper maxim of an unchallenged number one': 'Do good for
others in order to do well for yourself.'7

Most important, [the resurgent nationalisms of the rising challenger and
the declining hegemon are entirely compatible with a future relationship
characterized by peace]{.underline} and harmony. Obviously, the two
nationalisms pose no inherent conflict of interests: [China currently
wants more global influence; the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [wants less]{.underline}. Hence, [there is good
reason to expect a **soft landing** as the world moves from unipolarity
to bipolarity]{.underline}. Indeed, the future may well resemble
President Xi Jinping's proposal for a 'new type of great power
relations' (xinxing daguo guanxi), the idea that China and the United
States should share global leadership as equals and break a historical
pattern of inevitable confrontation between rising and established
powers.8 There is room in Asia for two great powers to coexist and
cooperate, in Xi's opinion, as long as they treat each other as equals.9

[If China continues to grow]{.underline} economically and militarily,
then, like every other rising power in history, [it will]{.underline}
surely [seek to expand its influence]{.underline} in the AsiaPacific
region and [throughout the globe]{.underline}. The question remains, how
should Washington respond? Operating within an emerging bipolar world,
Washington should adopt a grand strategy of offshore balancing:
redeploying its military forces 'offshore' and passing the 'balancing'
buck to regional powers in Asia. If China eventually makes a bid for
regional hegemony, the United States should wait and see if its regional
allies can contain it. If and only if such containment fails, then the
United States will be required to deploy enough firepower to the region
to restore a stable balance. The aim is to remain offshore as long as
possible, while recognizing that it may become necessary for US forces
to come back over the horizon. If that happens, however, Washington's
Asia-Pacific allies should still do much of the heavy lifting.10

#### Pax Americana declines [inevitably]{.underline} -- structural economic factors guarantee weakness -- it's only a question of the [transition]{.underline}

American decline redux [Today the [military, economic, institutional and
ideational pillars]{.mark} [that]{.mark} have [supported]{.mark} the Pax
[Americana]{.mark} [are]{.mark} [being challenged by
China]{.mark}]{.underline}. This raises two fundamental and intimately
connected questions: if China surpasses, equals or even approximates the
United States in these dimensions of power, can the Pax Americana
endure? And, if it cannot, what will replace it? Posing these questions
raises the contentious issue---contentious at least in the US---of
whether American power is, in fact, declining. During his abortive 2012
run for the Republican presi- dential nomination, Jon
Huntsman---President Obama's Ambassador to China, and now President
Trump's Ambassador to Russia---succinctly expressed the prevailing view
of the US foreign policy establishment when he said: 'Decline is
un-American.' Leading US security studies experts agree. [These
primacists argue that the extent of China's rise---and hence of
America's decline---are, like prema- ture reports of Mark Twain's death,
greatly exaggerated]{.underline}. Primacists believe the international
system is still unipolar, and that US power will keep it that way for a
long time to come. **[This claim is increasingly dubious]{.underline}**.
Indeed, the case made by the 'declinists' of the 1980s---notably Paul
Kennedy, Robert Gilpin, David Calleo and Samuel P. Huntington---looks
stronger every day.23 Contrary to the portrayal of their argument by
many of their critics, the 1980s declinists did not claim either that
America's post-Second World War power advantages had already dissipated,
or that the United States was on the brink of a rapid, catastrophic
decline. Rather, [they pointed to domestic and international economic
drivers that, over time, would cause **American economic power to
diminish relatively**, thereby shifting the balance of
power.]{.underline} In essence, [the declinists believed that the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates was [experiencing]{.mark} a
[slow]{.mark}---'termite-like'---[decline]{.mark} [caused by fundamental
structural weaknesses in the American economy]{.mark} that were
gradually nibbling at its founda- tions]{.underline}.24 Kennedy himself
was explicitly looking ahead to the effects this termite decline would
have on the US world role in the early twenty-first century. As he
wrote: [The task facing American statesmen over the next decades \... is
to [recognize]{.mark} that **[broad trends are under]{.mark}
[way]{.mark}**,]{.underline} and that [there is a need to
'[manage']{.mark} [affairs]{.mark} [so]{.mark} that [the relative
erosion]{.mark} of the United States' position [takes place slowly and
smoothly]{.mark}, [and is **not accelerated by policies**]{.mark}
**[which bring]{.mark} merely [short-term]{.mark} [advantage but
longer-term disadvantage]{.mark}**]{.underline}.25 The unwinding of the
Pax Americana [Decline may be 'un-American', but that does not mean it
isn't happening.]{.underline} Ameri- ca's 'unipolar moment' has turned
out to be rather---well, momentary.26 The Great Recession that began in
2007--2008 did not end America's unipolar ascen- dancy. It did, however,
focus attention on, and accelerate, the ebbing of American power---the
evidence of which has cumulated rapidly over the ensuing ten years.
[This slippage of US dominance is chipping away at each of the four
pillars on which the Pax Americana was erected: military power; economic
power; institu- tions; and soft power.]{.underline} As these pillars
erode, it becomes increasingly doubtful that the Pax Americana can
endure. China's challenge to American military power Until now the
dominant view within the US foreign policy establishment has been that
military strength is the one area in which America's advantage is insur-
mountable (at least within any meaningful time-frame). [[American
military power]{.mark} [is considered]{.mark} by US policy-makers and
many security studies scholars [to be the]{.mark} [geopolitical
trump]{.mark} [card]{.mark}]{.underline}---no pun intended---that will
ensure continuing American dominance even if China closes the economic
and technological gaps separating it from the United States.27 However,
some within the foreign policy establish- ment are beginning to question
this viewpoint. [Important recent studies of the Sino-American military
balance suggest that some analysts are taking a fresh look at the
question of how long it will take China to catch up with the US
militarily.]{.underline} China and the United States face different
grand strategic challenges. As self- styled global hegemon, America must
be able project decisive military power to the three regions it
considers vital to both its security and its prosperity: Europe, the
Middle East and east Asia. In contrast, China's strategic goals, at
least for now, are more limited. China aims at dominating its own
geographic backyard: that is, it seeks regional hegemony in east and
south-east Asia, which have become the focal points of Sino-American
geopolitical competition. [Even if China is not at present able to mount
a global challenge to the US, there is [evidence]{.mark} that
[it]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [beginning to draw level with the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates in regional military power in east Asia.]{.underline} In
a recent report on the Sino-American military balance, the RAND
Corporation refers to the 'receding frontier of US military dominance'
in east Asia.28 According to RAND, [the [trend lines]{.mark} in the
Sino-American military rivalry in east Asia **[are not favourable for
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates**]{.underline}: '[Although China has
not closed the gap with the United States, it has narrowed it---and it
has done so quite rapidly]{.underline}. Even for many of the
contributors to this report, who track military developments in Asia on
an ongoing basis, the speed of change \... was striking.'29 In a recent
book, Roger Cliff, an east Asian security expert at RAND, says that
[[by]{.mark} [2020]{.mark} [China's]{.mark} [military]{.mark}
establishment [will be]{.mark} almost [on]{.mark} **an [equal
footing]{.mark}** [with America's]{.mark} with respect to doctrine,
equipment, personnel and training]{.underline} (though still lagging
behind in organizational structure, logistics and organizational
culture). Consequently, he predicts that [by 2020 [American military
dominance]{.mark} in east Asia [will be significantly eroded.]{.mark}30
He predicts that the 2020s will witness a power transition in east Asia
and that at this point **China will be able to challenge the regional
status quo**]{.underline}.31

American economic decline and the impairment of US economic hegemony

become too numerous to ignore.]{.underline} Since the onset of the Great
Recession, [[China]{.mark} has successively [taken top position]{.mark}

and in the early to mid-2020s China is predicted to overtake the United
States in GDP measured by market exchange rate.33 [These shifts in the
relative economic power of China and the United States **have enormous
economic and geopolitical implications**]{.underline}. Indeed, in July

[Washington's inability to persuade Berlin to adopt a policy of economic

Jack Lew implicitly admitted this at the October 2015 IMF--World Bank
biannual meetings when, echoing President Obama, he stated that the
United States could not be the 'sole engine' of global growth. And the
Trump administration, although it has complained loudly that Germany
exports too much and imports too little, has like its predecessor been
unable to push or persuade Berlin into reducing its trade surplus while
simultane- ously increasing its consumption. [Even as the US ability to

balance]{.underline}. For example, the Obama administration's 'pivot' to
Asia was intended to reassure the nations of east and south-east Asia
that the United States would use its military power to offset China's
growing economic influence in the region. As Jeffrey Bader, the Obama
administration's National Security Council director for Asia, put it:
China's emergence, [China's rise, is the focus of attention not only of
the United States but among all countries in the region. **None of them
wants to have hostile or adversarial relations with
China**]{.underline}. At the same time, none wants to be dominated by
China. The countries in the region welcome the US presence as, if you
will, a kind of balance against China.47 However, the outlook for this
'balancing' strategy is clouded. Doubtless, Bader was correct: regional
states do not want to be forced to choose between aligning either with
China or with the United States. But [economic trends suggest that they
will be inexorably drawn into Beijing's geopolitical orbit by the
**overpow- ering magnetic pull of the Chinese economy**.]{.underline}
The lessening of America's regional economic influence, and the
corresponding jump in that of China, have been dramatic. [In 1993 China
accounted for only 2 per cent of ASEAN's trade in goods, and the United
States accounted for 18 per cent.]{.underline} [By 2013,]{.underline}
however, the [American share of ASEAN trade in goods had shrunk to 8.2
per cent while China's had skyrocketed to 14 per cent]{.underline}.48
Growing economic dependence on China is reflected in geopolitical
alignments. Since 2016, Malaysia, Cambodia, Myanmar and the Philippines
have all tilted away from the United States and towards China. Even
Australia, long a staunch US ally, is debating the merits of taking a
more equidistant political stance between Washington and Beijing because
of its economic dependence on China. In the coming years these trends
are likely to continue, and [China will be able to leverage its economic
power to enhance its geopolitical position in east and south-east
Asia---and diminish that of the United States.]{.underline}

#### China's rapidly surpassing the US economy \-- it\'s poised to set the new rules of IR

"China's Economy Could Overtake US Economy by 2030," *Voice of America*,

Accessed 7-1-22, LASA-AH)

[China's economy will increasingly rely on state investment, high-tech
development and domestic consumption]{.underline} -- with less input
from its past staple of export manufacturing -- [as it stands to
**overtake the United States** in the coming decade, analysts predict.
China's GDP should grow 5.7% per year through 2025 and then 4.7%
annually until 2030]{.underline}, British consultancy Centre for
Economics and Business Research (CEBR) forecasts. Its forecast says
[that China, now the world's second-largest economy, would **overtake
the No. 1-ranked U.S. economy by 2030.** Credit insurance firm Euler
Hermes made a similar forecast.]{.underline} Chinese leaders have pushed
over the past decade to rely more on value-added services over
traditional factory exports, state media have said. The Sino-U.S. trade
dispute and early 2020 workplace closures due to COVID-19 have added
pressure on manufacturing. Reducing factory output in China, foreign
multinationals have been expanding outside China, targeting places such
as Vietnam to avoid rising wages and environmental compliance costs[. By
offshoring in multiple countries they hope to head off any repeat of
China\'s early 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns that shut down
factories.]{.underline} China's economy totaled \$15.92 trillion in
2020, and market research firm IHS Markit estimates that it reached \$18
trillion last year on export manufacturing growth and capital for new
projects. The U.S. economy reached about \$23 trillion last year, the
market research firm said. State investment [The country that's already
known for fast economic growth over the past 20 years would see the
state take more control over key sectors after intervening in several,
including the internet, in 2021, economists expect.]{.underline}
"[Beijing has the funds and the unfettered domestic political power to
use China's large public treasury to make strategic investments in the
service of the leadership's national and global
objectives]{.underline}," said Denny Roy, senior fellow at the East-West
Center think tank in Honolulu. China scored 2.98 in 2018, up from 2.45
eight years earlier and approaching about three times the world average,
on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation Development policy forum's
Direct Control Over Enterprises index. That means the government's
direct control over enterprises "well exceeded the open economy average"
and "reflects China's increasing emphasis on the role of the state in
the economy under Xi Jinping," the think tank Atlantic Council says in
its October report China Pathfinder: Annual Scorecard . Growth in tech
hardware [Chinese leaders will probably prioritize tech, especially
hardware that does not require constant innovation, as a growth engine,
economists say.]{.underline} St[ate intervention in the internet sector
won\'t ~~hobble~~ \[inhibit\] expansion in semiconductors and
infrastructure software,]{.underline} said Zennon Kapron, founder and
director of the Shanghai-based financial industry research firm
Kapronasia. "[If the country does become self-sufficient in terms of
technology and then is able to sell and export those products and
services that are based on the technology, then that would be a huge
bump to its economy, because \[that\] is a key driver certainly of the
U.S. GDP now]{.underline}," Kapron said. The U.S. economy will keep
growing but without spurts through 2030, Kapron predicts. China has a
"huge base of engineers," albeit less creativity than it needs to foster
the "zany ideas" that drive development of new technology, said Douglas
McWilliams, founder and executive deputy chairman of CEBR. [Consumer
spending]{.underline} Domestic spending has driven most of China's
economic growth before 2021 as the country reduced its exposure to the
world in view of the Sino-U.S. trade dispute, McKinsey & Co. says in its
China consumer report 2021. Supply chains have "matured and localized,
and its innovation capabilities were enhanced" in turn, McKinsey & Co
says. That [trend is likely to continue despite hits to income under
lockdowns during the first year of COVID-19, analysts say]{.underline}.
China's population exceeds that of the United States by 3.5 times,
though American consumers are wealthier on average. "In the past five
years, domestic consumption has ... become a more significant growth
driver as China's domestic consumer market has grown dramatically in
size," said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist with IHS Markit.
Beijing's leadership "aims to create more than 11 million new urban jobs
and expand domestic demand and effective investment," the official
Xinhua News Agency said in mid-2021. Those measures, it said, "are
expected to put the economy firmly back to pre-pandemic vibrancy."
**[What if China overtakes US economy?]{.underline}** Status as the
world's largest economy does not confer any automatic advantages over
others, economists said, but [countries dependent on the Chinese economy
would take note.]{.underline} "There is no gold medal or anything like
that," CEBR's McWilliams told VOA. ["But when you've got more money to
spend, you do have the ability to influence things, and China will have
that ability to influence things."]{.underline} China would be better
placed, he said, to advance its Belt and Road Initiative, a 9-year-old
effort aimed at building land and sea trade routes through Asia, Europe
and Africa in the form of infrastructure projects and investments.
[Officials in Beijing are already leveraging their economy in disputes
with other countries, said Roy of the East-West Center. China vies with
four Southeast Asian governments over maritime sovereignty, contests a
group of islets with Japan and has gotten into territorial standoffs
with India since 2017.]{.underline} "The [result of that expectation
(China surpassing the United States economically) has been a bolder PRC
(People\'s Republic of China) foreign policy that seeks to settle
regional disputes in China's favor and to **de-legitimize U.S. regional
and global leadership** under the assumption that China is destined to
set the new rules of international relations]{.underline}," Roy said.

During the past decade, [signs of waning US economic power---and China's
growing economic muscle---have become]{.underline} too
[numerous]{.underline} to ignore. Since the onset of the Great
Recession, China has successively taken top position in the world in
exports (passing Germany); in trade (passing the United States); and in
manufacturing (claiming a title the United States had held for a
century). In 2014 the World Bank made the stunning announcement that
[China had vaulted past the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to
become the world's largest economy]{.underline} (measured by purchasing
power parity (PPP);32 and [in the early to mid-2020s China is predicted

organization's headquarters---which are required by its by-laws to be
located in its member country with the largest economy---could be in
Beijing.34 Taken together, [these indicators paint a clear picture of
*relative* economic decline]{.underline}.

American primacists have advanced a number of clever but unconvincing
arguments in an attempt to downplay the significance of the ongoing
economic power shift from America to China. For example, some primacists
assert that per capita GDP is a better yardstick of national power than
aggregate GDP; that newly developed metrics of national power have
diminished the importance of GDP as a measure of a state's economic
power; that China is far behind the United States in advanced
technology; and that China is incapable of doing innovation.35

This last claim is ubiquitous among primacists.36 It is, however,
undermined by recent developments. For example, in September 2016 China
began operating the world's largest radio telescope, which is intended
to project China's ambitions deep into the universe, and bring back the
kind of dramatic discoveries that win honours such as Nobel Prizes.37 In
August 2016 China launched the world's first quantum satellite, which
could lead 'to new, completely different methods for transmitting
information'.38 In another example of how [China is catching up with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [in innovation and
technology]{.underline}, in June 2016 a Chinese computer (using
made-in-China microprocessors) topped the ranking of the world's fastest
supercomputers.39 In July 2017 China's State Council announced an
ambitious plan to sprint to the front of the pack in artificial
intelligence (AI), including both military and civilian applications.40
Indeed, The Economist recently observed that already '[China could be a
close second to America]{.underline}---and perhaps even ahead of
it---[in]{.underline} some areas of [AI]{.underline}'.41 And China is
moving to the forefront in [green technologies]{.underline} (solar
panels and wind-generated power) [and]{.underline} in [electric
cars]{.underline}.42

[The waning of US economic dominance]{.underline} may not be obvious to
primacists, but it is perfectly apparent to many observers in the real
world.43 The weakening of US relative economic power, which became
unmistakably clear during the Great Recession, [has undercut the Pax
Americana both by compromising the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates' [ability to manage the international economy and
by shifting the Sino-American geopolitical balance in east
Asia]{.underline}.

([Twilight of the Titans: Great Power Decline and
Retrenchment]{.underline}, conclusion)

**[Unless trends in relative power reverse]{.underline}**, however, our
theory suggests [the]{.underline} incoming [administration will find it
difficult to abandon retrenchment. Given the **sluggish performance of
the American economy relative to its rivals**]{.underline}, continued
deficits, and concerns about the national debt, [there will be
limits]{.underline} [on]{.underline} the ability of the incoming
administration to ramp up [defense spending.]{.underline} Already, there
have been clashes between deficit and defense hawks in Congress over the
size and method of funding Trump\'s proposed defense increases.53 [The
continued increase of Chinese economic influence and military capacity
in Asia presents analogous geopolitical constraints on U.S.
policy]{.underline} in that region. Despite tough talk on the campaign
trail, the real- ity is that any lasting solution to the North Korean
nuclear program, mari- time disputes in the South China Sea, or the
status of Taiwan will require some accommodation of Chinese interests.
More broadly, [efforts to remake failed states or underwrite stability
in regions]{.underline} such as the Middle East [are likely to be met
with skepticism.]{.underline} [There is little enthusiasm within either
Congress or the public to undertake such ambitious
projects]{.underline}, and it seems likely that the favored
counterterrorism instruments will remain the familiar ones: standoff
airpower, assistance to local allies, the selective use of special
operations forces, and regional diplomacy. [Given the limits on
America\'s resources,]{.underline} time, and attention,
[the]{.underline} new [administration will prob- ably]{.underline}
imitate the old, [seek]{.underline}ing [to keep existing wars

"**[China is now the world's largest economy]{.underline}**."

How far away are we from that headline?

[Experts]{.underline} have [pegged]{.underline} [the date as arriving in
the]{.underline} **[next 10]{.underline}** **[years]{.underline}** or
so, and **[the likely dethroning]{.underline}** **[of the]{.underline}**
**[U.S. economy]{.underline}**, which has held the global top spot since
the late 19th century, will mark a seismic shift of power that's been
decades in the making.

But what steps can U.S. businesses and public policymakers take right
now, as China elevates both its internal repression and external
aggression, to stay viable in a fast-changing world?

Addressing those issues and providing insight and tactical guidance is
at the heart of Thursday's China Challenge Summit, presented by World
Trade Center Utah and Utah Valley University.

Organizers are billing the daylong event as an "unprecedented gathering
of the nation's top geopolitical thinkers, policymakers and business
executives to provide U.S. businesses, government leaders and civil
society with a deeper understanding" of the most critical issues,
including:

China's geopolitical strategy and U.S. foreign policy toward China.

China's economic, trade, business and foreign policies.

How U.S. businesses and policymakers should respond to these challenges.

The extensive list of speakers and presenters include Jon Huntsman,Jr.
former Utah governor and U.S. ambassador to China and Russia; Nicholas
Burns, current U.S. ambassador to China; former deputy national security
adviser Matt Pottinger; Glenn Tiffert, research fellow at the Hoover
Institution; Lingling Wei, chief China correspondent at The Wall Street
Journal; Mary Lovely, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for
International Economics; Damien Ma, managing director at the Paulson
Institute; Miles Hansen, president and CEO of World Trade Center Utah;
Astrid Tuminez, president of Utah Valley University; and many more.

How fast has China been able to assemble this new economic might?

[In 1960]{.underline}, [China's gross domestic product]{.underline}
**[was about 11%]{.underline}** [of the U.S. GDP]{.underline} [and now
**that figure** **is** hovering]{.underline} **[at about
70%]{.underline}**. [**China** has been the **biggest
global**]{.underline} [**exporter** since 2009]{.underline} [**and**, in
2013, **surpassed** the **U.S. to become the world's largest trading
country.**]{.underline}

Hansen said that **[in virtually every business sector]{.underline}**,
in Utah and **[across the country]{.underline}**, [China
has]{.underline} **[become recognized as the No. 1]{.underline}**
challenge on a wide variety of issues. And, thanks to a growing
disregard by nationalist nations for global trade and cooperation rules
established after World War II, countries like China and Russia have
opted, instead, to "crash through the rules" to achieve their
objectives.

"For the past 40 years, there's been the belief in the U.S. that as we
worked hard to help China develop its economy it would lead to a
moderation of China's domestic policy, increased respect for human
rights, improved foreign policy \... and free and fair markets," Hansen
said. "But over the past decade, really, what we've seen is ... that is
simply not happening.

"What we have seen is China becoming more repressive, more regressive.
What they're really working to do is make the world dependent on China
\... while also making itself independent from the rest of the world."

The last few decades have also seen a rising power and fiscal imbalance
between the U.S. and China as the country of 1.4 billion continues to
grow and solidify its economic might.

A [recent
analysis](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/great-economic-rivalry-china-vs-us) from
Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International
Affairs included these findings:

[China's sustained "miracle economic growth]{.underline}" [over
the]{.underline} [past four decades]{.underline} **[at an average
rate four times]{.underline}** [that of the U.S.,]{.underline} which
**[has redefined the global economic order.]{.underline}**

When measured by the traditional yardstick --- market exchange rate ---
since 2000, [China's GDP has soared]{.underline} [from \$1.2 trillion to
\$17.7 trillion.]{.underline} On the current trajectory, it will
overtake the U.S. within a decade. By the yardstick both the CIA and the
IMF judge to be the best metric for comparing national economies ---
purchasing power parity --- China has already surpassed the U.S. to
become the world's largest economy.

[China has **established** **itself** as **the most essential** link in
the world's critical **global supply** chains.]{.underline}

[China]{.underline} has **[replaced]{.underline}** [the U.S. as the
**primary** engine]{.underline} [of global economic growth.]{.underline}
Since the 2008 financial crisis, **[one-third of all growth
in]{.underline}** **[the world's GDP]{.underline}** [has]{.underline}
[**occurred** **in** just one country: **China**.]{.underline}

In 2020, [**China** **supplanted** the **U.S.** **as the home** **to the
largest number** **of** the most valuable global companies on
**Fortune's Global 500** for the first time]{.underline}. It has also
rivaled the U.S. as the leading country in attracting foreign investment
and is neck and neck with the U.S. in gross R&D investments.

#### American economic bullying decks instead of helps them. 

**Jiayao 22** \[Li Jiayao, 06-2-2022, American rules backed up by
coercive diplomacy, arbitrary bullying, ,
http://eng.chinamil.com.cn/view/2022-06/29/content_10167444.htm\] Eric

Not long ago, the US Secretary of State [Blinken]{.underline}
[delivered]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [speech on China
policy]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [highlighted]{.underline} the
so-called "**[China threats]{.underline}**", smeared China's domestic
and foreign policies, and once again accused it of "coercive diplomacy".
Yet **[this label is best pinned on the US itself.]{.underline}**

[In practicing]{.underline} its "**[coercive diplomacy]{.underline}**",
[the US leverages its superiority]{.underline} in the economic, military
and other sectors **[to force other countries]{.underline}** [to meet
its demands]{.underline} and change their way of action, all for the
purpose of achieving its own strategic goals and maintaining its
hegemony through improper means.

For many years, America has made no secret of its "coercive diplomacy".
In fact, it even takes pride in it, which is why it never hesitates to
blatantly and arbitrarily bully other countries for its own interests,
either through the threat of force or political isolation, economic
sanction or technological blockade. Washington acclaimed its success in
overthrowing the military regime of Haiti in 1994 as an example of
American "coercive diplomacy", and allocated about 30.3 billion U.S.
dollar in the additional defense budget of 2003 for executing "coercive
diplomacy".

[Being a master of "coercive diplomacy",]{.underline} [the US is not
fastidious about who it coerces]{.underline} -- [whether it's big or
small, nearby or distant, a friend or a foe]{.underline}. The
international community has suffered a great deal from it. [The US has
**blockaded**]{.underline} [**and sanctioned** **Cuba**]{.underline} for
more than half a century, and [its sanctions on]{.underline}
[Iran]{.underline} **[have lasted more than 40 years.]{.underline}**
Countries like **[Venezuela and Syria are]{.underline}** **[also victims
of its long-term sanctions]{.underline}**. At the same time, Washington
doesn't hesitate to stab its so-called allies, like the EU and Japan, in
the back either -- which is not uncommon. Sometimes beating about the
bushes, sometimes cutting right to the chase, the US has at its disposal
numerous tricks to force its allies to adjust their stance and serve
America's interests. Barbara Wesel, a commentator for Deutsche Welle,
said European countries have to pay a high political price in order to
keep up the alliance with the US.

With regard to international affairs, [the US has
consistently]{.underline} [**put domestic law** **above
international**]{.underline} law [and **abused** illegal **unilateral
sanctions**]{.underline} [and long-term jurisdiction]{.underline},
[while its **attitude** **toward**]{.underline} **[international rules
is rather selective]{.underline}**, only using those in its favor while
discarding those that are not. To maintain its hegemony, the US has
formed "cliques" for bloc politics, instigated hostility between
regional groups, and forced other countries and international
organizations to "pick sides". From the EU-US Dialogue to the AUKUS
trilateral security partnership, from the Quad mechanism to Five Eyes,
the US is holding up all kinds of banners of "partnership" while what
it's doing is creating division, egging confrontation, and benefiting
itself at others' expense. Its sustained attack on regional cooperation
architecture under the outdated Cold War mentality has seriously
undermined regional prosperity and stability.

[The US plays the **same game of threat**]{.underline} [and extortion
**with** **international organizations,**]{.underline} **[either tearing
up treaties]{.underline}** **[or backing out of the
organizations]{.underline}** to serve its political agenda. For a long
time, it takes the podium of the UN as its private turf and uses it to
pressure other UN members; [**it took issue with the** WHO]{.underline}
to shirk responsibility for losing control of the pandemic; **[it
withdrew from WHO]{.underline}** [**and stopped exporting vital
materials** when the world was at a critical juncture of the anti-virus
war, seriously threatening global public health and
security...]{.underline}

[The international community]{.underline} has **[long realized who
is]{.underline}** **[coercing the whole world]{.underline}** **[and
destroying global peace and stability]{.underline}**. [The country that
attempts to topple other countries and wreck up the world through
coercion, sanction and bullying **will end up hurting

SAN FRANCISCO --- 

[China's economy]{.underline} [will]{.underline} increasingly [rely on
state]{.underline} [investment]{.underline}, [high-tech
development]{.underline} [and domestic consumption]{.underline} -- [with
less input]{.underline} [from]{.underline} its past staple of [export
manufacturing]{.underline} -- [as it stands to **overtake the United
States**]{.underline} [in the coming decade]{.underline}, analysts
predict.

[China's GDP]{.underline} [should grow 5.7%]{.underline} [per
year]{.underline} through 2025 and then 4.7% annually until 2030,
British consultancy [Centre for Economics and Business
Research](https://cebr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WELT-2022.pdf%5d) (CEBR)
forecasts. [Its forecast]{.underline} says that China, now the world's
second-largest economy, **[would overtake the No. 1-ranked U.S.
economy]{.underline}** by 2030. Credit insurance firm Euler Hermes made
a similar forecast.

[Chinese leaders]{.underline} [have pushed over]{.underline} [the past
decade to rely more on]{.underline} [value-added services over
traditional factory ]{.underline}[[exports,]{.underline} state media
have said](https://www.voanews.com/a/china-weak-economy-/3152312.html).
The Sino-U.S. trade dispute and early 2020 workplace closures due to
COVID-19 have added pressure on manufacturing.

[Reducing factory output]{.underline} [in China, foreign]{.underline}
[multinationals have **been expanding outside China**]{.underline},
targeting places such as Vietnam to avoid rising wages and environmental
compliance costs. [By offshoring in multiple countries]{.underline}
[they hope to head off any]{.underline} [repeat of China\'s early 2020
COVID-19 lockdowns]{.underline} that shut down factories.

China's economy totaled \$15.92 trillion in 2020, and market research
firm IHS Markit estimates that it reached \$18 trillion last year on
export manufacturing growth and capital for new projects. The U.S.
economy reached about \$23 trillion last year, the market research firm
said.

State investment

The country that's already known for fast economic growth over the past
20 years would see the state take more control over key sectors after
intervening in several, including the internet, in 2021, economists
expect.

"[Beijing has the]{.underline} [funds]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the
**[unfettered domestic political power]{.underline}** to use China's
large public treasury [to make strategic investments]{.underline} in the
service of the leadership's national and global objectives," said Denny
Roy, senior fellow at the East-West Center think tank in Honolulu.

China scored 2.98 in 2018, up from 2.45 eight years earlier and
approaching about three times the world average, on the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation Development policy forum's Direct Control Over
Enterprises index.

That means [the government's direct]{.underline} [control over
enterprises "**well exceeded the open economy average**]{.underline}"
and "reflects China's increasing emphasis on the role of the state in
the economy under Xi Jinping," the think tank[ Atlantic
Council](https://chinapathfinder.org/china-pathfinder-annual-scorecard/) says
in its October report China Pathfinder: Annual Scorecard .

[Growth in tech hardware]{.underline}

[Chinese]{.underline} [leaders]{.underline} [will]{.underline} probably
[prioritize tech,]{.underline} [especially hardware that]{.underline}
[does not require constant innovation]{.underline}, as a growth engine,
economists say.

[State intervention]{.underline} in the internet sector [won\'t hobble
expansion]{.underline} [in semiconductors and]{.underline}
[infrastructure software]{.underline}, said Zennon Kapron, founder and
director of the Shanghai-based financial industry research firm
Kapronasia.

"If the country does become self-sufficient in terms of technology and
then is able to sell and export those products and services that are
based on the technology, then that would be a huge bump to its economy,
because \[that\] is a key driver certainly of the U.S. GDP now," Kapron
said.

[The U.S. economy will keep growing but without spurts through
2030]{.underline}, Kapron predicts.

[China has a "**huge base of engineers**]{.underline}," albeit less
creativity than it needs to foster the "zany ideas" [that drive
development of new technology]{.underline}, said Douglas McWilliams,
founder and executive deputy chairman of CEBR.

Consumer spending

[Domestic spending]{.underline} [has driven most of China's]{.underline}
[economic growth before 2021]{.underline} as the country reduced its
exposure to the world in view of the Sino-U.S. trade dispute, [McKinsey
& Co.
says](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/china/china%20still%20the%20worlds%20growth%20engine%20after%20covid%2019/mckinsey%20china%20consumer%20report%202021.pdf) in
its China consumer report 2021. **[Supply chains have "matured and
localized]{.underline}**, **[and its innovation capabilities were
enhanced]{.underline}**" in turn, McKinsey & Co says.

That trend is likely to continue despite hits to income under lockdowns
during the first year of COVID-19, analysts say. China's population
exceeds that of the United States by 3.5 times, though American
consumers are wealthier on average.

"In the past five years, [domestic consumption has]{.underline} ...
[become a more significant growth driver]{.underline} as [China's
domestic consumer market has]{.underline} **[grown dramatically in
size]{.underline}**," said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist
with IHS Markit.

Beijing's leadership "aims to create more than 11 million new urban jobs
and expand domestic demand and effective investment," the
official [Xinhua News Agency
said](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-07/15/c_1310062812.htm) in
mid-2021. Those measures, it said, "are expected to put the economy
firmly back to pre-pandemic vibrancy."

What if China overtakes US economy?

Status as the world's largest economy does not confer any automatic
advantages over others, economists said, but countries dependent on the
Chinese economy would take note.

"There is no gold medal or anything like that," CEBR's McWilliams told
VOA. "But when you've got more money to spend, you do have the ability
to influence things, and China will have that ability to influence
things."

China would be better placed, he said, to advance its Belt and Road
Initiative, a 9-year-old effort aimed at building land and sea trade
routes through Asia, Europe and Africa in the form of infrastructure
projects and investments.

Officials in [Beijing are already leveraging]{.underline} [their economy
in disputes with other countries]{.underline}, said Roy of the East-West
Center. China vies with four Southeast Asian governments over maritime
sovereignty, contests a group of islets with Japan and has gotten into
territorial standoffs with India since 2017.

"[The result of that expectation]{.underline} ([China surpassing the
United States economically)]{.underline} [has been a bolder
PRC]{.underline} (People\'s Republic of China) [foreign
policy]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [seeks]{.underline} to settle
regional disputes in China's favor and [to de-legitimize U.S. regional
and]{.underline} [global leadership]{.underline} **[under the assumption
that China is destined to set the new rules of international
relations,"]{.underline}** Roy said.

WASHINGTON (AP) --- [China's growing military muscle and its drive to
end American predominance]{.underline} in the Asia-Pacific is [rattling
the U.S. defense establishment]{.underline}. [American officials see
trouble quickly accumulating on multiple fronts]{.underline} ---
[Beijing's expanding nuclear arsenal, its advances in space, cyber and
missile technologies, and threats to Taiwan]{.underline}. ["The pace at
which China is moving is stunning]{.underline}," says Gen. John Hyten,
the No. 2-ranking U.S. military officer, who previously commanded U.S.
nuclear forces and oversaw Air Force space operations. [At stake is a
potential shift in the global balance of power]{.underline} that has
favored the United States for decades. [A realignment more favorable to
China does not pose a direct threat to the United States]{.underline}
but could complicate U.S. alliances in Asia. New signs of how the
Pentagon intends to deal with the China challenge may emerge in coming
weeks from Biden administration policy reviews on nuclear weapons,
global troop basing and overall defense strategy. For now, [officials
marvel at how Beijing is marshaling the resources, technology and
political will to make rapid gains]{.underline} --- so rapid that the
Biden administration is attempting to reorient all aspects of U.S.
foreign and defense policy. Th[e latest example of surprising speed was
China's test of a hypersonic weapon capable of partially orbiting Earth
before reentering the atmosphere and gliding on a maneuverable path to
its target]{.underline}. [The weapon system's design is meant to evade
U.S. missile defenses, and although Beijing insisted it was testing a
reusable space vehicle, not a missile]{.underline}, the test appeared to
have startled U.S. officials. Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said the test was "very close" to being a Sputnik
moment, akin to the 1957 launching by the Soviet Union of the world's
first space satellite, which caught the world by surprise and fed fears
the United States had fallen behind technologically. What followed was a
nuclear arms and space race that ultimately bankrupted the Soviet Union.
Milley and other U.S. officials have declined to discuss details of the
Chinese test, saying they are secret. He called it "[very concerning"
for the United States]{.underline} but added that problems posed by
China's military modernization run far deeper. "[That's just one weapon
system]{.underline}," he said in a Bloomberg Television interview. "[The
Chinese military capabilities are much greater than that. They're
expanding rapidly in space, in cyber and then in the traditional domains
of land, sea and air]{.underline}." On the nuclear front, private
satellite imagery in recent months has revealed large additions of
launch silos that suggest the possibility that [China plans to increase
its fleet of]{.underline} land-based intercontinental ballistic
missiles, or [ICBMs]{.underline}. Hans Kristensen, a nuclear weapons
expert at the Federation of American Scientists, says [China appears to
have about 250 ICBM silos under construction]{.underline}, which he says
is more than 10 times the number in operation today. [The U.S. military,
by comparison, has 400 active ICBM silos]{.underline} and 50 in reserve.
Pentagon officials and defense hawks on Capitol Hill point to China's
modernization as a key justification for rebuilding the U.S. nuclear
arsenal, a project expected to cost more than \$1 billion over 30 years,
including sustainment costs. Fiona Cunningham, an assistant professor of
political science at the University of Pennsylvania and a specialist in
Chinese military strategy, says a key driver of Beijing's nuclear push
is its concerns about U.S. intentions. "I don't think China's nuclear
modernization is giving it a capability to pre-emptively strike the U.S.
nuclear arsenal, and that was a really important generator of
competition during the Cold War," Cunningham said in an online forum
sponsored by Georgetown University. "But what it does do is to [limit
the effectiveness of U.S. attempts to pre-emptively strike the Chinese
arsenal]{.underline}." Some analysts fear Washington will worry its way
into an arms race with Beijing, frustrated at being unable to draw the
Chinese into security talks. Congress also is increasingly focused on
China and supports a spending boost for space and cyber operations and
hypersonic technologies. There is a push, for example, to put money in
the next defense budget to arm guided-missile submarines with hypersonic
weapons, a plan initiated by the Trump administration. For decades, the
United States tracked China's increased defense investment and worried
that Beijing was aiming to become a global power. But for at least the
last 20 years, Washington was focused more on countering al-Qaida and
other terrorist threats in Iraq and Afghanistan. That began to change
during the Trump administration, which in 2018 formally elevated China
to the top of the list of defense priorities, along with Russia,
replacing terrorism as the No. 1 threat. For now, Russia remains a
bigger strategic threat to the United States because its nuclear arsenal
far outnumbers China's. But Milley and others say [Beijing is a bigger
long-term worry because its economic strength far exceeds that of
Russia]{.underline}, and it is rapidly pouring resources into military
modernization. [At the current pace of China's military investment and
achievement, Beijing "will surpass Russia and the United States" in
overall military power in coming years]{.underline} "if we don't do
something to change it," said Hyten, who is retiring in November after
two years as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "It will
happen." The Biden administration says it is determined to compete
effectively with China, banking on a network of allies in Asia and
beyond that are a potential source of strength that Beijing cannot
match. That was central to the reasoning behind a Biden decision to
share highly sensitive nuclear propulsion technologies with Australia,
enabling it to acquire a fleet of conventionally armed submarines to
counter China. Although this was a boost for Australia, it was a
devastating blow to Washington's oldest ally, France, which saw its \$66
billion submarine sale to Australia scuttled in the process. Taiwan is
another big worry. Senior U.S. military officers have been warning this
year that China is probably accelerating its timetable for capturing
control of Taiwan, the island democracy widely seen as the most likely
trigger for a potentially catastrophic U.S.-China war. The United States
has long pledged to help Taiwan defend itself, but it has deliberately
left unclear how far it would go in response to a Chinese attack.
President Joe Biden appeared to abandon that ambiguity when he said Oct.
21 that America would come to Taiwan's defense if it were attacked by
China. "We have a commitment to do that," Biden said. [The White
House]{.underline} later said he was [not changing U.S. policy, which
does not support Taiwanese independence]{.underline} but is committed to
providing defensive arms.

#### Chinese military dominates US\-\-- but overtake is peaceful.

David **Brown** 12-21-**2021** \[Writing for BBC, BBC News, "Why China
could win the new global arms race,"
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-59600475//ZW\]

[China is building up its armed forces at a rapid pace]{.underline}. Its
[advances in missile technology, nuclear weapons and artificial
intelligence have triggered serious concern among many Western
observers]{.underline}, who believe a [profound shift in the global
balance of military power is under way]{.underline}. President
[Xi]{.underline} Jinping has [ordered China\'s armed forces to modernise
by 2035]{.underline}. They should, he says, [become a \"world-class\"
military power]{.underline}, capable of \"fighting and winning wars\" by
2049. It is a huge undertaking, but [the country is on
target]{.underline}. Spending big [China has been criticised by some
international experts for a \"lack of transparency]{.underline}\" over
how much it spends on defence, and an \"inconsistent reporting of
figures\". Beijing does publish official spending data, but [Western
estimates of China\'s financial support for its armed forces are often
significantly higher]{.underline}. It is widely believed that [China
currently spends more on its armed forces than any country except the
US]{.underline}. The growth of China\'s military budget has outpaced its
overall economic growth for at least a decade, according to the Center
for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. [Boosting the
nuclear stockpile]{.underline} In November, the US Department of Defense
predicted that [China was set to quadruple its nuclear
stockpile]{.underline} by the end of the current decade. China, it said,
\"[likely intends to have at least 1,000 warheads by
2030]{.underline}\". Chinese state media called the claim \"wild and
biased speculation\", adding that nuclear forces were kept at a
\"minimum level\". However, experts at the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute, who publish annual assessments of global stockpiles,
say C[hina has been increasing the number of its warheads over recent
years.]{.underline} China is still a long way short of the US stockpile
of 5,550 warheads, but its [nuclear build-up is being seen as one of the
biggest threats to Western military supremacy]{.underline}. \"China\'s
nuclear weapons are the most important issue,\" according to Veerle
Nouwens, of the Royal United Services institute in London. \"There is a
huge lack of trust on both sides and dialogue is nowhere near the level
needed. There are big risks and the off-ramps are difficult to see.\"
Hypersonic future Hypersonic missiles travel at more than five times the
speed of sound. They are not as fast as intercontinental ballistic
missiles, but they are so difficult to detect in flight that they may
render some air defences useless. \"[The Chinese understand that they
are]{.underline} a long way [behind]{.underline}, so [they are trying to
make big breakthroughs to leap-frog other powers]{.underline},\"
according to Dr Zeno Leoni, of King\'s College London. \"[Developing
hypersonic missiles]{.underline} is one of the ways they\'re trying to
do this.\" China has denied testing hypersonic missiles, but Western
experts believe that two rocket launches last summer indicate that its
[military is well on the way to acquiring them]{.underline}. It\'s
unclear exactly what systems China may be developing. There are two main
types: [Hypersonic glide missiles stay within the Earth\'s
atmosphere]{.underline} Fractional orbital bombardment systems (FOBS)
fly in low orbit before accelerating towards a target It is possible
that China may have succeeded in combining the two systems, [firing a
hypersonic missile from an FOBS manoeuvrable spacecraft]{.underline}. Dr
Leoni says that while hypersonic missiles may not - on their own - be a
game-changer, they [will make some targets highly vulnerable to
attack]{.underline}. \"Hypersonic missiles make aircraft carriers in
particular much more difficult to defend,\" he says. However, he also
suggests that that the threat from Chinese hypersonic missiles may have
been overstated by some Western officials, who are keen to make as
strong a case as possible for the financing of military space
technology. \"[The threat is real]{.underline}. Yet, it is possible that
this is being exaggerated.\" [Artificial intelligence and cyber-attacks
China is now fully committed to developing \"intelligentised\"
warfare]{.underline}, or future military methods based on disruptive
technologies - especially artificial intelligence, according to the US
Department of Defense. China\'s Academy of Military Science has been
given a mandate to make sure that this happens, through \"civil-military
fusion\", in other words joining up Chinese private sector technology
companies with the country\'s defence industries. Reports suggest that
[China may already be using artificial intelligence in military robotics
and missile guidance systems]{.underline}, as well as unmanned aerial
vehicles and unmanned naval vessels. [China has already conducted
large-scale cyber-operations abroad]{.underline}, according to a recent
expert assessment. In July the UK, US and EU accused China of carrying
out a major cyber-attack targeting Microsoft Exchange servers. It is
believed that the attack affected at least 30,000 organisations globally
and aimed to enable large-scale espionage, including the acquisition of
personal information and intellectual property. The world\'s largest,
but not most powerful, navy [China has overtaken the US to become the
largest navy in the world]{.underline} - but experts point out that a
simple comparison of ship numbers leaves out numerous factors which
determine a navy\'s capabilities. But, they say, an examination of the
trends can be useful. For now, the US maintains a strong lead in many
naval capabilities, with 11 aircraft carriers to China\'s two, and more
nuclear-powered submarines, cruisers and destroyers - or larger
warships. But [China is expected to expand its navy much
further]{.underline}. Former People\'s Liberation Army Senior Colonel
Zhou Bo, of Tsinghua University in Beijing, says he believes it is
\"[critically important]{.underline}\" [for China to strengthen its navy
to counter the sea-based threats which it faces]{.underline}. In
particular, he says: \"T[he most outstanding problem we face is what we
perceive to be American provocation in China\'s waters]{.underline}.\"
The US Navy predicts that between 2020 and 2040, the total number of
Chinese navy ships will increase by nearly 40%. Uncertain future Is
[China moving away from non-confrontation towards a more threatening
stance]{.underline}? For now, [the Chinese approach is still \"win
without fighting]{.underline}\", says Dr Leoni, although he adds that it
could change this strategy some time in the future. \"Becoming a fully
modernised naval power could be one tipping point.\" But Senior Colonel
Zhou insists that Western fears are unfounded. \"China has no intention
of policing the world, unlike the United States,\" he says. \"[Even if
China becomes much stronger one day, it will maintain its basic
policies]{.underline}.\" [China has not fought a war since
1979]{.underline}, when it went into battle with Vietnam, so much of its
military capabilities are completely untested. Many in both the West and
in China will hope it stays that way.

#### China will be able to challenge the US military by 2020

In a recent report on the Sino-American military balance, the RAND

in east Asia.28 [According to RAND, the trend lines in the Sino-American

be almost on an equal footing with America's]{.underline} with respect
to doctrine, equipment, personnel and training (though still lagging
behind in organizational structure, logistics and organizational

#### A focus on hard power just increases the risk of conflict -- the US can't prevent the collapse of the rest of its power

**Freeman, 17** - Senior Fellow, the Watson Institute for International
and Public Affairs, Brown University (Chas, "Reimagining Great Power
Relations" 3/9,
<http://watson.brown.edu/files/watson/imce/people/fellows/freeman/ReimaginingGreatPowerRelations.pdf>

[[International reactions to]{.mark}]{.underline} the election of Donald
[[Trump]{.mark} have [catalyzed a **far swifter collapse of the
American-led world order**]{.mark} than anyone could have
imagined]{.underline}. Interactions between great and middle-ranking
powers are undergoing rapid evolution. The political, economic, and
military interests and influence of the United States still span the
globe, as does American popular culture. Nations and non-state actors in
every region continue to worry about American policies, activism, or
passivity on matters of concern to them. In short, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is still the planet's only
all-around world power. **But the clout that status confers is not what
it used to be**.]{.underline}

The only other polity with the potential to rival America's worldwide
influence at present is the European Union (EU). It has the money but
lacks the ambition or political and military cohesion to exert decisive
influence beyond its periphery. Until "Brexit," the EU included two
former world powers, Britain and France. Now only France \-- which
retains a sphere of influence in Africa and overseas territories in the
Caribbean, Indian Ocean, and Polynesia -- can bring a global perspective
to EU councils.

China and Japan have great worldwide economic influence but little
political appeal and negligible ability to project conventional military
power to regions remote from them. Russia has a nuclear arsenal that can
devastate every corner of the globe. It has again become a major actor
in the Middle East, but otherwise lacks economic, political, or cultural
reach much beyond the confines of the former Soviet Union. Brazil and
India dream of global roles but exercise little influence beyond their
immediate regions and the parts of Africa that are closest to them.

The [[Trump]{.mark}]{.underline} administration's [[rejection of
multilateralism marks a major step back]{.mark} from international
leadership by the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. It signals
that America no longer seeks to make and interpret the rules that govern
the world's political, economic, and military interactions. Instead,
[[Washington will seek unilateral advantage through piecemeal bilateral
deals. This]{.mark} pivot away from preeminence has [created a
**geopolitical and geoeconomic power vacuum** into which other great
powers are being drawn]{.mark}]{.underline}. Responsibility for the
maintenance of global political, economic, and military order is
everywhere devolving to the regional level.

Meanwhile, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is
increasingly isolated on transnational issues]{.underline}. Official
American antipathy to science on climate change and similar issues has
discredited the United States as a participant in setting polices that
address them. And Washington's escalating disdain for the United Nations
and international law has delegitimized its role as the "world
policeman." The uncertainties inherent in this situation are everywhere
accelerating the formation of regional groupings. But, despite some
stirring by China, [there is as yet no credible successor to the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [as a global
order-setter.]{.underline}

The U.S. armed forces remain the only military establishment with global
power projection capabilities and experience in managing multinational
coalitions. Generals and admirals bestride the highly militarized
foreign policy apparatus of the United States government. This caps a
longstanding trend. Americans so thoroughly identify "power" as
exclusively military in nature that it has been necessary to invent an
academic concept of "soft power" to embrace measures short of war like
diplomacy.

But [[global military primacy no longer translates into political
leadership]{.mark} at either the global or regional levels. It doesn't
even guarantee dominance in the world\'s regions]{.underline}.

Recent American [[military interventions]{.underline}]{.mark} abroad
[have consistently [evoke]{.mark}d [resistance]{.mark}]{.underline} that
has frustrated the achievement of their goals. Unless tied to clearly
attainable political objectives, the use of force can accomplish little
other than the slaughter of foreigners and the destruction of their
artifacts. This generates more blowback than security.

[[As American influence has receded]{.mark}, regional great powers like
[China, India, Iran, and Russia have begun to consolidate regional state
systems]{.mark} centered on themselves]{.underline}. This process was
underway even before "America first" impaired U.S. leadership by making
American indifference to the interests and concerns of other countries
officially explicit. [[America has now chosen]{.mark} publicly [to
redefine itself]{.mark} internationally [as the **foreign relations
equivalent of a sociopath** -- a country indifferent to]{.mark} the
[rules]{.mark}, the [consequences]{.mark} for others of its ignoring
them, [and]{.mark} the]{.underline} 1 [[reliability of its
word]{.underline}.]{.mark} No nation can now comfortably entrust its
prosperity or security to Washington, no matter how militarily powerful
it perceives America to be.

In the United States, there has been a clear drift toward the view that
outcomes, not due process, are the sole criteria of justice. Procedures
-- that is, judicial decisions, elections, or actions by legislatures --
no longer confer legitimacy. The growing American impatience with
institutions and processes is reflected in the economic nationalism and
transactionalism that now guide U.S. policy. Washington now reserves the
right to pick and choose which decisions by international tribunals like
the World Trade Organization (WTO) it will follow or ignore.

The idea that previously agreed arrangements can be abandoned or
renegotiated at will has succeeded the principle of "PACTA SUNT
SERVANDA" ("agreements must be kept"). The result is greatly reduced
confidence not only in the reliability of American commitments but also
in the durability of the international understandings that have
constituted the status quo. In the security arena, this trend is
especially pronounced with respect to arms control arrangements. As an
example,, Russia has cited American scofflaw behavior to justify its own
delinquencies in Ukraine and with respect to the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty.

[When a hegemon fails to pay attention to the opinions of its
allies]{.underline}, dependencies, and client states [or to show its
adversaries that it can be counted upon to play by the
rules]{.underline} it insists they follow, [it conjures up its own
antibodies]{.underline}. In the absence of empathy, there can be no
mutual reliance or collective security. [Without confidence]{.underline}
in the reliability of protectors or allies, [nations must be ready to
defend themselves by themselves at any moment]{.underline}. If covenants
are readily dishonored, the law offers no assurance of safety. Only
credible military deterrence can protect against attack.

The post-Cold War era began in 1990 when the international community
came together to affirm that the new order should not allow large states
to use force to annex smaller, weaker neighbors, as Iraq attempted to do
with Kuwait. But the opening years of the 21st century have taught small
and medium-sized nations a different lesson. They have learned that to
preclude threats to their independence and territorial integrity from
great powers they must either accommodate them, seek the protection of
alliances with others, or possess the capacity to inflict severe injury
on any potential attacker, no matter how militarily powerful.

They have learned that there is no longer any security to be found in
the United Nations Charter or its decision-making processes.
International law and vetoes in the U.N. Security Council did not
protect Serbia from great power intervention to detach Kosovo from it.
Nor did opposition in the Security Council prevent the coercive
separation of Crimea from Ukraine. No one even bothers to mention
international law in discussions of Syria, where external interventions
to produce regime change have been unabashedly overt. The old rules no
longer provide security. They are increasingly ignored.

An Indian general remarked after the 1990-91 Gulf War that its lesson
was clear. To be secure from attack by the United States one must
possess a nuclear deterrent. (Pakistan would no doubt say the same thing
about India, as would some in Iraq and Iran about Israel.) Lacking
nuclear weapons, Iraq and Libya saw their governments overthrown and
their leaders brutally murdered. Nuclear-armed North Korea -- by any
measure, a far more dangerous regime -- has so far been spared foreign
attack. It is telling that every non-nuclear weapons state now allegedly
attempting to develop such weapons and related delivery systems
(including north Korea) is said to be doing so to deter an attack by the
United States. Not one appears to be motivated by a desire to deter
China, Europe\'s nuclear powers, India, Japan, Pakistan, or Russia.

[Across the globe, the lessened security that results from the erosion
of rule-bound order has been compounded by]{.underline} hysteria over
attacks by [terrorists. The spread of Islamophobia has paved the way for
the revival of other forms of xenophobia, like racism and anti-Semitism.
Illiberalism looks like the wave of the future. We are witnessing the
consolidation of national security-obsessed garrison
states]{.underline}.

Some sub-global powers \-- like [Iran, Turkey, Russia, and China \-- are
demanding deference to their power by the countries in their "near
abroad"]{.underline} or "near seas." [They]{.underline} thus [negate the
near-universal sphere of influence that America asserted during the
so-called "unipolar moment" of worldwide U.S. hegemony]{.underline} that
followed the Cold War. [They are imposing their own military
precautionary zones]{.underline} ("cordons sanitaires") to manage and
reduce external threats from other powers. This pushback is resented by
the United States, which -- with no sense of irony, given its own
insistence on exclusive control of the Americas -- charges them with
attempts to project illegitimate \"spheres of influence\" beyond their
borders.

[By disavowing longstanding U.S. commitments]{.underline}, the
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration has inadvertently
[**[confirmed]{.underline}** [foreign doubts about American
reliability]{.underline}. [Efforts to allay]{.underline} ]{.mark}[these
[concerns]{.mark} have [garnered little credence]{.mark}. [The ebb of
U.S. influence is forcing countries]{.mark}]{.underline} previously
dependent on Washington's protection [[to]{.mark} make unwelcome choices
between]{.underline} diversifying their international relationships,
[[decoupl]{.mark}ing their [foreign policies from
America]{.mark}\'s]{.underline}, forming their own ententes and
coalitions to buttress deterrence, [[or accommodat]{.mark}ing more
[powerful neighbors]{.mark}]{.underline}. Whatever mix of actions they
choose, they also boost spending to build more impressive armed forces.

Almost all [countries still under U.S. protection continue to affirm
their alliance with the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [even
as they ramp up a capacity to go it alone]{.underline}. **[[Arms races
are becoming the norm]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in most regions of the
world]{.underline}. Global military expenditures grew by fifty percent
from 2001 to 2015.

Not long ago, geopolitics was largely explicable in bipolar terms of
US-Soviet rivalry. After a unipolar moment, the political and economic
orders have gone fractal -- understandable only in terms of evolving
complexities at the regional or sub-regional level. Intra-regional
rivalries now fuel huge purchases by middle-ranking powers of
state-of-the-art weaponry produced by the great powers. No one should
confuse increased weapons purchases with a deepening of alliance
commitments.

So, for example, Saudi Arabia's arms purchases have tripled in the past
five years. Trends in other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member
countries are similar. At the same time, the Gulf Arabs are reaching out
to China, the EU, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, and Turkey and
convening pan-Muslim coalitions against Islamist terrorism and Iran.
They have undertaken unprecedentedly unilateral and aggressive military
interventions in places like Libya, Syria, and Yemen. As they have done
so, the countries of the Fertile Crescent -- Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria --
have drawn ever closer to Iran. Iraqi Kurdistan has become a de facto
Turkish dependency. Before a Western-supported coup ousted Ukraine's
elected president , that country wobbled 2 between East and West but was
on its way into the Russian embrace. The Philippines has distanced it
from the United States and bundled with China. So has Thailand. Myanmar
and Vietnam, by contrast, are seeking partners to balance China. The
Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have doubled down on
their reliance on NATO, which they joined in 2004 to secure their
independence from Russia. Cuba and Venezuela look to Russia and China
for support against ongoing American policies of regime change.

Meanwhile, international governance of trade and investment continues to
devolve to the regional level and configure itself to supply chains.
Examples include new trade pacts, like the RCEP, the Pacific Alliance,
and the Eurasian Economic Union; preexisting blocs like the 3 4 5 GCC,
Mercosur, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization; as well as
well-established 6 7 8 confederations like the 27-member post-Brexit EU
and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) . Each of
these groupings has one or two heavyweight members at 9 its core,
constituting a natural leadership.

Where such regional arrangements have been implemented, rules are made
and enforced without much, if any, reference to external powers. Thus,
the EU has had no role to speak of in shaping relations between Canada,
Mexico, and the United States under the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA). Conversely, the United States has had very little say
in decisions made in Brussels on rules for trade and investment in the
EU and its associated economies. Given the Trump administration's
aversion to multilateralism, the United States will have no say at all
in the standard-setting that will take place in either the RCEP or the
65-country pan-Eurasian economic community that is beginning to emerge
from China's "belt and road" initiative. Regionalism limits the reach of
great powers. Bilateralism limits it even more.

The decentralization of authority over global economic, political, and
defense issues represents a net loss of influence by the U.S. and other
great powers over the evolution of the international state system. But
it presents both a challenge and an opportunity for middle-ranking
powers. On the one hand, as U.S. and EU influence atrophies, they have
an expanding role in international rule-making. On the other, they are
now subject to pressure from neighboring great powers that is
unmoderated by any global rules.

Take Mexico as an example. This is a proud nation of nearly 130 million
people, the world's 13th largest country geographically and its 11th
most populous. It has the world's 11th largest economy. By every
measure, Mexico is a middle-ranking power. As such, even if it were not
a member of NAFTA and the Pacific Alliance, it would have a significant
voice in the G-20, the WTO, the United Nations, Latin America, the
Caribbean, and the Asia-Pacific.

Interdependence has mitigated but not erased historic Mexican resentment
of domineering American behavior. Mexicans have not forgotten that the
United States invaded their country and annexed 55 percent of its
territory in 1846 - 1848. But, since the entry into force of NAFTA in
January 1994, Mexico's economy has become almost fully integrated with
the American economy through complex supply chains. Eighty percent of
Mexican exports now go to the U.S. Mexico has become the United States'
second largest export market and its third largest trading partner
(after China and Canada). It has also quietly transformed itself into a
reliably pro-American bulwark against influences from extra-hemispheric
powers like Russia and China. It has proven the efficacy of economic
opening and reform and has become an influential advocate of liberal
economics as opposed to the perennial statism and mercantilism of most
other Latin American nations.

Now Mexico is faced with demands from the Trump administration to
cooperate in dismantling its interdependence with the United States. At
the same time, the U.S. president is denigrating Mexicans, proposing to
wall them out, and threatening to deport masses of undocumented migrants
and alleged criminals to Mexico, whether they are Mexican or not and
whether Mexico has any legal reason to accept them or not. Not
surprisingly, Mexican opinion is now hostile to the United States.
Mexico's government has little leeway for compromise. Surrender to
American demands is not an option. But Mexico currently has little
leverage over Washington.

So Mexico faces highly unwelcome choices. It can bargain as best it can
on its own, risking its prosperity and stability on what is almost
certainly a bad bet. It can seek leverage over the United States by
suspending cooperation against transit by illegal migrants and the
supply of narcotics to American addicts. It can make common cause
against the United States by forming a global united front with other
economies targeted by the Trump administration for their bilateral trade
surpluses, like China, Germany, Japan, and south Korea. It can adopt
Cuban-style defiance of Washington's efforts to bring it to heel,
allying itself with extra-hemispheric powers like China and/or Russia or
Iran. Or it could choose some mixture of all of these options. It is too
early to predict what course Mexican-American relations will take in the
age of Trump. They will be affected by many factors, including the state
of relations between the United States and other great powers --
especially China and Russia.

Mexico is far from the only middle-ranking power now of necessity
maneuvering between the world's great powers. Ukraine has yet to find
its place between Russia, the EU, and the United States. Turkey has
distanced itself from the EU and America and formed an entente (limited
partnership for limited purposes) with Russia. Iran has reached out to
India as well as Russia in order to counter the United States and the
Gulf Arabs. Saudi Arabia -- once exclusively attached to the United
States -- is actively courting China, India, Indonesia, Japan, and
Russia. Pakistan is seeking to avoid having to choose between Saudi
Arabia and Iran. At the same time, it has accepted the task of
coordinating the activities of a pan-Islamic military alliance that
implicitly counters both Iran and an ever more assertively Islamophobic
India. To reduce dependence on the United States and the GCC, Egypt is
courting cooperation with Iran, Russia, and Turkey. Old global
alignments are everywhere giving way to more complex patterns.

Despite an unprecedented degree of interdependence between them,
relations between the great powers are also in motion. Brazil, China,
the EU, India, Japan, Russia, and the United States are each one
another's largest or second largest trading partners and sources of
foreign direct investment. They are linked to each other in global
supply chains, which tend to converge in and between large economies.
All are members of the Bretton Woods legacy institutions -- the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and WTO. These
institutions earlier accommodated the rise of Japan. More recently, they
have lagged in reflecting the rapidly increasing weight of other
non-Western economies in world trade and finance.

The formation of the "BRICS" group was a collective effort by Brazil,
Russia, India, and China (soon joined by South Africa) to develop
institutions to reflect the current distribution of global commercial
and financial power and contemporary governance requirements. When
Bretton Woods took place the world had just been crushed by World War
II. America dominated the world economy, justifying its preeminent role
in global governance. Recent shifts in economic balances of power have
not been reflected in legacy institutions. Washington remains the
nominal leader in them but finds itself increasingly sidelined as others
feel obliged to work around it. The Trump administration's skepticism
about the value of the international economic institutions that earlier
generations of Americans created has accelerated the diminishment of
U.S. managerial control over the global economy.

Similar [erosion of U.S. primacy is evident]{.underline} in
international politics. [China, India, and Russia have met annually
since 2002 to discuss how to establish a multipolar world
order]{.underline} in which U.S. unilateralism cannot hold sway.
[Antagonism between the world's greatest powers is growing. With the
United States pushing back against Russia in the West and China in the
East, the two are being nudged together to counter America]{.underline}.

To offset Sino-Russian partnership, Japan seeks rapprochement with India
and Russia, leavening its longstanding exclusive reliance on the United
States. China, Europe, Russia, and the United States are also courting
India, which is, as always, playing hard to get. Meanwhile, China is
reaching out to Europe and the EU is attempting to work with it to fill
the leadership vacuum in the Asia-Pacific created by the sudden U.S.
abandonment of the economic leg of its "pivot to Asia." No region is
immune from realignment in its international relationships. Brazil's
membership in the BRICS group symbolizes its cultivation of
relationships with emerging powers to balance those it has with the
United States and middle-ranking powers in the Western Hemisphere.

As a consequence of these trends, [we are now well into a world of many
competing power centers and regional balances]{.underline}. Long-term
vision and short-term diplomatic agility are at a premium. Neither is
anywhere evident. In their absence, [[territorial disputes]{.mark}
rooted in World War II and Cold War troop movements and lines of
control, [arms races (nuclear]{.mark} [as well as conventional]{.mark}),
shifting balances of prestige, [and the reduced moderating effect
of]{.mark} international [organizations are helping to **escalate
alienation and tension between the great powers**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The stakes are high. Trade wars that could wreck the global economy and
degrade the prosperity of all are now all too easy]{.underline} to
imagine. [[Armed conflict could break out at any
time]{.underline}]{.mark} along the unsettled borders between China and
India and China and Japan. [The U.S. and Chinese navies are maneuvering
against each other in the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea. [The two]{.underline} countries [appear to be headed
for a military confrontation over Taiwan]{.underline}. The Peloponnesian
War and World War I remind us that squabbles between lesser powers can
drag their patrons into existential strife despite their better
judgment.

Notwithstanding ample opportunity to do so, the U.S., EU, and Russia
failed to craft a cooperative post-Cold War order to regulate their
interaction in Europe. [There is no agreement on where NATO ends and
Russia begins. We now face the possibility that it will take an armed
face-down to define a dividing line between them]{.underline}.

All great powers now share an avowed interest in containing Islamist
terrorism and remediating its causes. [Escalating antipathies born of
territorial disputes and Chinese and Russian opposition to U.S. primacy
prevent cooperation]{.underline} to this end. [The politically expedient
demonization of strategic rivals in democracies like the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [inhibits cooperation even
where specific interests nearly completely coincide]{.underline}. The
same factors diminish the likelihood of cooperation on other matters
where interests substantially overlap \-- like Syria and Korea.

Meanwhile, U.S. deployments of ballistic missile defenses and the
increasing lethality of American nuclear warheads have convinced both
Russia and China that Washington is reaching for the ability to
decapitate them in a first strike. [[Russia and the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[are in a
nuclear arms race]{.mark} again]{.underline}. [[China]{.mark} seems to
have been provoked to develop a second-strike capability
that]{.underline}, like Russia's, [[will be able to
**annihilate**]{.underline}]{.mark}, not just maim
[[America.]{.underline} [The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has moved
its "**Doomsday Clock" the closest to midnight since
1954**]{.underline}]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}**

The risks the world now faces were not (and are not) inevitable. They
are the product of lapses of statesmanship and failures to consider how
others see and react to us. [[The setbacks to America's ability to shape
the international environment]{.underline}]{.mark} to its advantage are
not the result of declining capacity on its part. They [[are the
consequence of a failure to adapt to]{.mark} new realities and [shifting
power balances. **Raging against change will not halt
it**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Pulling down the frameworks and trashing the
rules on which North American and global prosperity were built is far
more likely to prove counterproductive than empowering. Buying more
military hardware will not remedy the national strategy deficit. Gutting
the foreign affairs agencies and doubling down on diplomacy-free foreign
policy will deepen it.

Twinned Acceleration

The trend had already existed for almost three decades at the very
least, however, two factors have accelerated this trend: technological
innovation and geopolitical transformations. 

Since the start of the 21st century, [the growth in digital
tech]{.underline}nologies [have]{.underline} irrevocably **[changed the
financial landscape]{.underline}** forever. While cryptocurrencies such
as Bitcoin have been the most well-known part of this change, a rather
significant driver is the rise of electronic platforms that enabled have
automated financial markets and liquidity management as well as allowed
the creation and growth of [real time payment
systems](https://www.paymentsjournal.com/real-time-payments-everything-you-need-to-know/).
[These]{.underline} [electronic]{.underline} [systems]{.underline}
[have]{.underline} greatly [lowered]{.underline} [the costs of setting
up trading posts]{.underline} for different currency pairs and lowered
transactional savings that existed by using the dollar instead of local
currency pairs. Economically speaking, both lower costs and high
inflation export from the United States nudged many countries in the
developing world to look into other currencies as part of their
diversified reserves along with gold.

[Geopolitical actions are another driver]{.underline} in this trend,
[the constant **weaponization of the global economic
system**]{.underline} by the United States [has caused]{.underline} a
few [countries to look towards **alternative payment
arrangements**]{.underline} in order to continue to trade with
sanctioned countries. [Both Russia and China have]{.underline} already
**[created alternative payment systems]{.underline}** [ranging from
local equivalents of the SWIFT]{.underline} [such as the CIPS and the
SFPS to a local Russian card transaction system]{.underline} called MIR
to substitute both American-owned Visa and Mastercard. This is not to
mention the existence of INSTEX that was originally created by one of
United States' allies, the European Union, as a way to bypass sanctions
on Iran. In other words, [**the** **reckless use of
sanctions**]{.underline} [by the United States]{.underline} [has shown
to the world that it cannot trust a financial system]{.underline} that

[In 2033, a U.S. spacecraft]{.underline} [will]{.underline}
[return]{.underline} to Earth [carrying]{.underline} the [second cache
of rocks]{.underline} [ever collected]{.underline} from the surface of

collected]{.underline} **[by China two years]{.underline}** **[earlier,
in 2031]{.underline}**, according to
plans [released](https://spacenews.com/china-aims-to-bring-mars-samples-to-earth-2-years-before-nasa-esa-mission/) last
week by one of China\'s top space scientists.

Of course, there\'s no guarantee that either mission will succeed. But
[China\'s **impressive** recent **successes**]{.underline} operating on
and above the Moon and Mars [give the country a better]{.underline}
[chance]{.underline} [at lapping NASA and its partners.]{.underline}

[The news]{.underline} [may cause alarm]{.underline} [among Americans
accustomed]{.underline} [to being first in]{.underline} [space for more
than a half-century]{.underline}. This is no Sputnik moment, however,
and there is no reason to panic.

A mission to bring back the samples is an impressive technological
achievement. But the future of Mars exploration isn\'t sample returns;
it\'s discovering past life on Mars. For now, the US is better
positioned to accomplish that goal.

In 1993, NASA initiated the [Mars Exploration
Program](https://mars.nasa.gov/), or MEP, a long-term initiative
to [explore](https://mars.nasa.gov/#mars_exploration_program/1) Martian
geology, climate and the possibility of past life, while laying a
foundation for human exploration. Over the next three decades, [NASA
launched orbiters]{.underline} [and rovers revealing
ancient]{.underline} [river]{.underline} [and lake beds, as]{.underline}
[well as mineral evidence]{.underline} [of a wet and warm Martian
past.]{.underline} These discoveries heightened interest in seeking out
evidence for past Martian life, and launching additional probes to find
it.

Unfortunately, the [scientific]{.underline} [instruments]{.underline}
[necessary to prove that life]{.underline} [once existed on
Mars]{.underline} [are simply [too large and
complex](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8863/searching-for-life-in-nasas-perseverance-mars-samples/)]{.underline} to
transport to the planet's surface. To make that kind of history-altering
discovery, pieces of Mars must be brought back to Earth. That\'s a
complex endeavor.

For example, [one early NASA
concept](https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/bitstream/handle/2014/16893/99-0303.pdf?sequence=1) had
two rovers landing on Mars, collecting samples and then launching them
into orbit, where a third vehicle would rendezvous with them and
dispatch them back to Earth. That mission would\'ve started launching in
2003 and returned samples in 2008. Instead it was canceled over cost and
difficulty.

[Twenty years ago]{.underline}, **[there was little
competition]{.underline}** [for the U.S. in space]{.underline}. [The
Russian program was in terminal decline]{.underline}, [and China
was [just starting](https://www.mfa.gov.cn/ce/ceus/eng/xw/t34741.htm) to
launch humans into space.]{.underline}

[But **despite a late start**]{.underline}, [China\'s leadership
was [determined to catch
up](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/22/world/heading-for-the-stars-and-wondering-if-china-might-reach-them-first.html)]{.underline}.
[It\'s an ambition]{.underline} **[inspired by the belief that the
country\'s economic and military future will,]{.underline}** **[in part,
be determined by its space capabilities.]{.underline}**

[During the early 2000s]{.underline}, [the **Chinese** **announced** an
**ambitious program** **of lunar exploration**]{.underline}, [a future
space station and, tentatively, a Mars program]{.underline}. [**In each
case**, they]{.underline} **[have followed through and achieved
successes]{.underline}**, [including lunar rovers]{.underline}, [a Mars
orbiter and]{.underline} [rover, and a small but functional space
station]{.underline} [that could [have Earth orbit to itself if the
US doesn\'t replace the aging International Space
Station](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-02-02/as-the-iss-decays-bring-on-the-private-space-stations) by
the end of the decade.]{.underline}

[That would be]{.underline} **[a public-relations]{.underline}** **[and
technical triumph for the Chinese]{.underline}**. But if it doesn\'t
happen, China remains keen to find another high-profile way to surpass
the US in space.

Until recently, Mars was not an obvious place to do it. In 2012,
after a [recommendation from the National Academy of
Sciences](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/13117/vision-and-voyages-for-planetary-science-in-the-decade-2013-2022),
NASA [began
work](https://spacenews.com/mars-planning-group-endorses-sample-return/) on
new concepts for sample-return missions. Like earlier ones, these
required multiple spacecraft, starting with a rover to collect samples
from a region of Mars that shows promise as a repository of past life.

Rather than wait for the full mission to be designed and built, NASA
landed the Mars Perseverance rover near a dried-up Martian river delta
in 2021. The rover contains 43 tubes for soil and rock samples that ---
scientists hope --- will eventually be returned to Earth after they\'re
dropped somewhere on the Martian surface, to be picked up later by
another rover. This retrieval rover, in turn, will deliver them to a
rocket (which also needs to be landed on Mars) that will fly them to a
spacecraft that will ferry them to Earth.

For now, the only part of this return mission that exists is
the [Perseverance](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/) rover, which
is [currently seeking promising samples for eventual return to
Earth](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01543-z).

The other parts of the mission, estimated to cost around \$5 billion,
have yet to be funded or built. They\'re also delayed: In March,
NASA [postponed](https://www.space.com/perseverance-mars-sample-return-delay-2033) the
return to 2033, from 2031, in part to provide time to simplify the
complicated mission.

**[That\'s China\'s opening]{.underline}**. [Its scientists
believe]{.underline} [they can beat the US back to]{.underline}
[Earth]{.underline} [by leveraging tech]{.underline}nologies [used on
China\'s recent]{.underline} [lunar sample return,]{.underline} **[and
Mars rover and orbiter missions.]{.underline}**

As outlined in
a [presentation](https://twitter.com/YuqiiQian/status/1538712547875991552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1538712547875991552%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fspacenews.com%2Fchina-aims-to-bring-mars-samples-to-earth-2-years-before-nasa-esa-mission%2F) given
last week by the chief designer of China\'s current Mars rover, it\'s a
simpler mission than NASA\'s. Most notably, it doesn\'t include rovers
that can sample different sites over a large geographic area. Instead,
the mission appears to be designed to land, grab samples (potentially
using a four-legged robot), and get them back to China.

If China can pull it off, it\'s a tremendous technical accomplishment,
and the samples will be of considerable scientific interest. With a
little luck, they may even contain the evidence of life that US
scientists hope to discover with their own samples.

[The Ukrainian crisis]{.underline} [is showing day after day
the]{.underline} [weakness of]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
[current]{.underline} US [administration]{.underline} [headed by
Biden]{.underline} in a way that confirms that the era of American
hegemony is about to end. President [Biden]{.underline} [may have
made]{.underline} many [heroic statements]{.underline} ahead of the
military operation in Ukraine, [but as soon as]{.underline}
[Putin]{.underline} [decided]{.underline} [to opt for a military
solution]{.underline} to get to the negotiating table, [Biden withdrew
from the battle]{.underline}, **[shamelessly failing the Ukrainian
president]{.underline}**. The situation provoked the world's ridicule
and the astonishment of the Ukrainian president, who did not have
sufficient ability or experience to properly assess the political
situation.

President [Biden]{.underline} [has managed]{.underline} [the Ukraine
crisis]{.underline} **[in the worst possible way]{.underline}**,
[showing the whole]{.underline} [world]{.underline} [that he can deter
Russia when the actual truth is certainly **the opposite**.]{.underline}
The United States may have the ability to project its power anywhere in
the world, but when dealing with another great power's sphere of
influence, its deterrence capacity is greatly diminished.

This is not the first time that the weakness of the United States
against Russia has been shown. The reluctance of the United States to
take a hostile decision toward Russia appeared before in 2014 when Putin
annexed Crimea during the Obama administration. At the time, many
scathing criticisms of the Obama administration were directed, but he
was able to sidestep the situation and show the United States as a
powerful hegemon, but reluctant to interfere in matters of Russian
national security.

But this time the matter is very different. [The United
States]{.underline} [pushed Ukraine to provoke Russia]{.underline},
[despite knowing]{.underline} that [its]{.underline} [ability to protect
Ukraine **is very limited**]{.underline} for multiple reasons. First,
Ukraine does little to benefit US interests. And secondly, the United
States cannot deter Russia in its sphere of influence. Third, the long
and costly wars of the twenty-first century in Afghanistan and Iraq have
drained popular support for US-led military interventions abroad. More
importantly, NATO forces and the European Union will not play an
important role other than imposing sanctions and travel bans, as the
European market is highly dependent on Russian natural gas. Add to all
of the above internal American problems such as inflation, the immigrant
crisis, and rising nationalism.

For all these reasons, [politicians from both the
Republican]{.underline} [and Democratic parties **leveled sharp
criticism**]{.underline} **[that amounted to mocking
Biden's]{.underline}** **[contradictory actions]{.underline}** **[that
undermine the hegemony of the United States in the international
arena]{.underline}**. For example, JD Vance, a candidate for the US
Senate, said in a statement on Twitter, "the foreign policy
establishment that led Ukraine directly into the slaughterhouse deserves
nothing but scorn."

Also, in another statement, Kevin [McCarthy]{.underline} [and GOP
leaders]{.underline} [said]{.underline}: "Sadly, President [Biden
consistently chose appeasement and his tough talk on Russia]{.underline}
[was]{.underline} [never followed by strong action]{.underline}.
Republican Senator Lindsay Graham, speaking about Biden, also said in
the same vein" You said a couple of years ago that Putin did not want
you to win because you're the only person that could go toe-to-toe with
him. Well right now, Mr. President, you're playing footsie with
**[Putin. He's walking all over you."]{.underline}**

All those involved in political action in the United States know very
well that the threat to engage in war with great powers such as Russia
will cost a heavy price that the United States cannot afford now despite
its undeniable strength. Accordingly, after years of deep political
divisions over foreign policy and the role of the United States in the
world, no one in power has suggested the option of war. Instead, Putin's
military operation in Ukraine revealed a rare point of consensus between
Democrats and Republicans as everyone criticized the Biden
administration's escalation of events, rejecting the idea that the
United States would go to war to stop him. Some want tougher sanctions
and say they should have been imposed before the invasion as a
deterrent, others question why the US should be involved at all, and
everyone agrees it's Biden's fault.

[This]{.underline} apparent [decline of US hegemony has **profound
repercussions** as it urges many other great powers to move
forward]{.underline}. [Today, questions abound about how China will deal
with Taiwan, Japan, etc., and issues related to its regional interests.
Although the United States may still possess the hegemonic power, it no
longer can unilaterally deter or enforce the actions of other great
powers. Russia's involvement in the Syrian civil war, the Iranian
nuclear program, and aggression in the Arctic all clearly show that the
Russians no longer believe that the United States is fully **capable**
of containing or deterring their actions.]{.underline} Recent years have
shown that other major powers are testing how far the United States will
go to maintain its position in the system, and if the United States is
perceived be weak to or unwilling, the great powers will assert their
presence. Certainly, Ukraine is the latest example of Russia's ability
to limit American hegemony.

### 2nc \-\-- Polarization China Heg Inevitable

#### Lack of Democracy-- destroys functionality at home which signals to our allies a lack of trustworthiness -- that's Fukuyama AND

\"**[We are now living in an age when American dominance is coming to an
end, and its security guarantees are losing
credibility]{.underline}**,\" writes an article on Russian media RT on
the first anniversary of the January 6 Capitol riot in the US. [Even if
we can\'t predict exactly when we will enter a \"post-American era,\"
**the decline of the US will definitely be the general
trend.**]{.underline} Just a prelude [The results of a
recent]{.underline} [poll]{.underline} from The Washington Post and the
University of Maryland [are alarming: 34 percent of Americans
believe]{.underline} [violence]{.underline} [against the]{.underline}
[government is sometimes justified]{.underline}. That\'s quite a
disturbing sign for Washington\'s domestic affairs. It\'s unimaginable
to think that even half of these people might really take violent
actions. In this sense, the Capitol riot might be just a prelude. At the
end of June last year, a special committee was established to
investigate the \"facts, circumstances and causes\" of the Capitol riot.
However, after more than half a year, no result has come out amid the
endless bipartisan tug of war. [The attack on the US
Capitol]{.underline} [and the aftermath reflect]{.underline} **[growing
division in the US.]{.underline}** There are also divergent views on the
riot in both the Democratic and Republican Parties. For example, Nikki
Haley, a member of the Republican Party, has been openly critical of the
Capitol riot. It is afraid that there are even more Republicans
supporting the Capitol riot in their hearts. Therefore, it\'s not
surprising that the investigation of the incident faces obstacles.
According to a new poll from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst,
[nearly one-third of Americans doubt]{.underline} [that Joe Biden\'s
victory]{.underline} in the 2020 presidential election [was
legitimate]{.underline}. As midterm elections approach in late 2022,
accusations of electoral fraud and violence are likely to resurge in
every state, especially in some of those in the Midwestern and Southern
US. [And when election results are disputed, it is anticipated that
violence may also increase.]{.underline} A divided US Coincidentally,
The Wall Street Journal and The Hill respectively published articles on
Monday with titles that began with the phrase \"to save America.\" One
title read \"To Save America, the GOP First Has to Save Itself,\" the
other reading \"To save America, we need a council of presidents.\"
There is a severe division within the US. Some people think that
political polarization cannot be resolved and can only be controlled.
But the US has no effective measures for control at all. Take the
pandemic fight as an example. [It\'s fair to say that the federal
government has \"lied flat\" and did nothing to stop the
spreading.]{.underline} Biden recently told the nation\'s governors that
there is no federal solution to the pandemic and the next steps in
fighting the COVID-19 pandemic had to be taken at the state level. But
in fact, many things still need to be done under the leadership of the
federal government. [The US federal government now appears to be an old
man in his twilight years. It looks quite exhausted and helpless to
achieve its goals. The US\' inaction in both internal affairs and
diplomacy is a pretty terrible thing. **If I were an American, I would
feel that this is a rather depressing time.** The root
cause]{.underline} for various problems in the US [is the contradiction
between different social classes. But with the meddling of US
politicians, the contradiction has been turned into a bipartisan issue.
Under the so-called political correctness, the class contradiction has
been converted into other inexplicable controversies. For instance, can
Americans own guns? Should people be vaccinated or wear
masks?]{.underline} [Behind these controversies are the hardships of the
people and their discontent. Both the middle class and the grassroots
communities feel increasingly hopeless]{.underline}. [Their discontent,
as a result, will accumulate, further creating more turmoil in the
US.]{.underline} The \'post-American era\' **[The US now is no longer
capable of dominating the world due to its internal systemic
festering]{.underline}**. There was a period of time after the Cold War
when the US felt as if it was invincible. Indeed, it did have the
capability to fight anyone it wanted then. But this is no longer the
unipolar era that the US has enjoyed for the past few decades. Americans
may also know in their hearts that that time is gone, as the wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq have weakened their confidence. Moreover, there are
still two countries that have the absolute ability to protect their own
sovereignty: China and Russia. In Washington\'s strategic view, any
country other than the US should not have sovereignty. In other words,
the US can theoretically eradicate any person or government that it
wants. But Beijing and Moscow have made the US lose the ability to do
so, as both are engaging in more cooperation to maintain stability in
the world. [The end of US hegemony is also proven by the fact that **the
days when the US could easily bring other countries to their knees by
using the stick of sanctions are gone**]{.underline}. For example,
[Washington has been trying to suppress 5G technology]{.underline} [from
Chinese tech giant Huawei.]{.underline} It did manage to make Huawei
lose some of its smartphone business. [However, Huawei was not \"ended\"
by the US, and without the former, the latter\'s 5G technology
development is still lagging behind.]{.underline} The US seemed to
believe that it could do anything if it was able to control Huawei. But
the reality is that it has neither received any substantial benefit nor
caused much damage to China. Instead, the country has set a bad example
to the world and lost its credibility. [Judging from the current global
situation, **it looks that the US is in gradual decline.**]{.underline}
But such a trend could be slowed if young, strong politicians come to
the stage with the right policies. The US is now like a patient
suffering from a chronic disease lying in a hospital bed and barely able
to open their eyes. The future of the US depends on a renewal of the
\"youth\" of US politics. If nothing changes, the US will continue to
project that it can\'t open its eyes in the face of difficulties. [Even
though the two-party system has been working well for almost 100 years
in the US, there are still some undercurrents. **Democratic and
Republican Parties can now barely maintain the two-partite
system.**]{.underline} It seems that US politics is a matter of
coordination between two groups of people, but in reality, it is much
more complicated since the spectrum within both parties is complex. For
example, the left-wing of the Democratic Party, including the young
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (also known by her initials AOC), holds
opinions that are completely different than those of traditional
Democrats. If we really enter the \"post-American era\" one day, I think
it will be a better time for consultation, and the world will become a
more democratic place. We can\'t predict when that time will come, but
we can be prepared for that day.

### 2nc \-\-- International Institutions Prefer China

#### [Institutional Frameworks]{.underline} -- IMF and UN are shifting towards China AND AIIB

**Layne 18** - professor at Texas A&M University\'s. George H. W. Bush
School of Government and Public Service (Christopher, "The US--Chinese
power shift and the end of the Pax Americana," 2018,
<https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/images/ia/INTA94_1_6_249_Layne.pdf>,
Accessed 6-30-22, LASA-AH)

The institutional challenge to the Pax Americana Not only is the [Pax
Americana being whittled away by]{.underline} constraints on Washing-
ton's ability to continue playing its role as the manager of the global
economy, and by China's ever-increasing economic dominance of its
region; even more strik- ingly, [the institutional
framework]{.underline} is being challenged. [An important indicator of
the Pax Americana's erosion is the weakening of its legacy institutions
amid calls, magnified by the Great Recession, for a major overhaul of
the international institutional order]{.underline}. Examples include
demands that the [IMF and World Bank be reformed to give
China]{.underline} (and other key emerging market economies) [greater
voting power, and a]{.underline} (so far unsuccessful) [push to expand
the membership of the UN Security Council by adding, among others,
Brazil and India.]{.underline} Another indicator of the shifting global
balance occurred in November 2008 when the G8 global economic summit was
transformed into the G20 by the addition of China and other emerging
market states including India, Indonesia and South Africa. The G20's
creation as the new focal point for coordinating international economic
policy was a response to the insistence of China, and the other major
emerging market states, that they be given a greater voice in interna-
tional economic affairs. [Implicitly, the G20's emergence confirmed
three trends. **First**, the necessity of conceding power to the
emerging market states---especially China---confirmed that **America's
relative power is declining**.]{.underline} **[Second]{.underline}**,
the [G20's empowerment underscored the shift in power from the
Euro-Atlantic world to Asia]{.underline}. Whereas only one Asian nation
(Japan) had been a G8 member, the G20 has six members from the region:
Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan and South Korea. Finally, the
G20's emergence as the central organ of international economic
management demonstrated that---as a result of the Great Recession--- the
prestige and authority of the United States and Europe as stewards of
the international economy had slipped dramatically.49 [The past decade
or so also has seen the creation of new institutions that poten- tially
could constitute a parallel---'shadow'---international order outside the
framework of the Pax Americana]{.underline}. The most important of these
may be the [Beijing- backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank
(AIIB]{.underline}). Other examples include the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization, the Collective Security Treaty Organiza- tion, the
Eurasian Economic Union and the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China,
South Africa[). The staying power and impact of these institutions are
uncertain; but at the very **least they are important
symbolically.**]{.underline} They underscore the decline of the
American-designed post-Second World War international order, and the
rise of new powers such as China and India---and the resurgence of old
ones such as Russia---demanding recognition of their status and
prestige, and a concomitant voice in the management of the international
system.

### 2nc \-\-- Transition Peaceful/Voluntary Abdication

#### The aff's boost to US [material power]{.underline} doesn't overcome the [political]{.underline} problem of [voluntary abdication]{.underline}

**Schweller, 18** - Randall Schweller is Professor of Political Science
and a Social and Behavioral Sciences Joan N. Huber Faculty Fellow, The
Ohio State University ("Opposite but Compatible Nationalisms: A
Neoclassical Realist Approach to the Future of US--China Relations" The
Chinese Journal of International Politics, 2018, 23--48 doi:
10.1093/cjip/poy003

Given the tendency for declining powers, especially those under
conditions of low vulnerability, to reduce peripheral commitments and
look inward, a few wonder that [American citizens, after decades of
political consensus, are now questioning their country's grand strategy
of deep engagement with the rest of the world]{.underline}. And, to the
shock and dismay of the mainstream media, they elected a President who,
in his 2017 inauguration speech, emphasized his winning campaign slogan:
'From this day forward, it's going to be only America first. America
first. Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign
affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American
families.'55

[While there is no Trump Doctrine]{.underline} as of yet, [the tone is
unmistakably one of global retreat]{.underline} or, more accurately, a
retreat from globalism. On his third day in office, [he withdrew from
the Trans-Pacific Partnership]{.underline}, a 12-nation trade deal
designed by the United States as a counterweight to a rising China. In
June, [he announced that he would pull the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [out of the Paris Agreement]{.underline} on climate
change, following through with a key campaign promise. Trump also
announced that he intends to withdraw the United States from UNESCO; he
abandoned United Nations talks on migration; and he threatened to
terminate the 2015 Iran nuclear deal if Congress and US allies fail to
amend the agreement in significant ways; [he wants to fix or rip up the
free-trade agreement with South Korea]{.underline} (known as Korus) [and
NAFTA]{.underline}---casting both pacts as failures for the United
States. Trump has proposed reducing US contributions to the United
Nations by 40%, and pressured the General Assembly to cut six hundred
million dollars from its peacekeeping budget. His 2018 budget proposes a
42% cut in foreign assistance, or \$11.5 billion, and reduces American
funding for development projects, such as those financed by the World
Bank.56 [Of NATO, Trump said that he would 'certainly look at' pulling
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates out of the international
security alliance, because it is 'obsolete' and 'is costing us a
fortune.'57

To be sure, there has been something of a 'bonfire of many of the
established concepts of American grand strategy' since Trump was
elected. Some observers, like Richard Haass, President of the Council on
Foreign Relations and a former State Department official during the
George W. Bush administration, claim that the [Trump]{.underline}
administration [is engaged in an **'abdication' of US global
leadership**--- **not because of any loss of military or economic
power**]{.underline} that forced America to retrench from its global
commitments [but rather because the administration 'chose to walk
away]{.underline} from many of the institutions, frameworks,' and to
'introduce questions into alliances that have really formed or informed
American foreign policy now for nearly three quarters of a century'.58

#### Chinese leadership gives it a [stake]{.underline} in Asian stability -- it means the transition is [peaceful]{.underline} 

**Kopits, 16 -** Steven Kopits is a President of Princeton Energy
Advisors. He consulted to government, state-owned enterprises and
private clients in post-socialist Eastern Europe from 1990 to 2005, and
monitors developments in China for his firm's clients ("China Should
Push for American-Style Hegemony" The National Interest, 8/3,
<http://nationalinterest.org/feature/china-should-push-american-style-hegemony-17238?page=show>

On the other hand, [[if China behaves as a legitimate system operator,
then squeezing out the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[becomes]{.mark}]{.underline} an
[[attainable]{.underline}]{.mark} goal. [It would do so [by providing
hegemonic services to the East Asian community better]{.mark} and
cheaper [than the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates does. Such services include protecting and
assisting in the clarification of regional property rights, as well as
the creation of impartial, credible and competent institutions to foster
the development of shared resources. It may also imply backstopping the
United States to ensure that critical East Asian imports---for example,
Saudi and Iranian oil---continues to flow to the region, even if the
United States fails to provide security services in the Middle East.

China is well placed to play this role. The country specializes in
providing manufactures and services of good quality much cheaper than do
the western powers. Playing regional hegemon would simply be an
extension of existing commercial strategy to the diplomatic sphere. And
China has huge advantages, because an authoritarian regime with ample
financial resources can move more quickly and decisively than the
protracted and mushy process that characterizes democracy.

Furthermore, China is local in East Asia. The United States is not.
Consider that not many people know that the United States actually has
two border disputes with Canada. The only way the United States cannot
resolve these disputes is with force, even though it could easily defeat
Canada in a war. Were the United States to try, Canada would immediately
look for allies, and among these would be China. Thus, the United States
threat of force would bring China into regional North American disputes.
Trust in United States intentions around the world would also be
undermined. If the United States is willing to seize Canadian territory
by force, what might it do in the Middle East? Might the United States
decide to take over, say, Bahrain? The hegemon, in some cases, cannot
even threaten force even if it could easily win a fight.

China faces the same logic. [If the country threatens it
neighbors]{.underline}, as it has, [then the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is sucked into intra-Asian disputes and China's
wider intentions in places like South and East Asia come into
question]{.underline}. [An aggressive China]{.underline} in the South
China Sea [paints China as a general threat to the region]{.underline}.

However, if China is providing the public service of policing in East
Asia, then the United States will feel comfortable leaving. The voting
public in democracies traditionally dislikes spending money on the
military in remote parts of the world. They would rather spend it on
healthcare and pensions at home. If the United States public feels the
country can afford to spend less in Asia---because China is doing a
better job than the United States could---then the United States will
withdraw. For China, [[the challenge is not defeating the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, [[it is
allowing the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[to leave]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This is]{.underline}]{.mark} a
process of [[displacement, not confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark}. China
allows the United States to withdraw by providing hegemonic services to
the region better and cheaper than the United States. It's that simple.

History tells us that assuming hegemony does not imply war. [[The
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[displaced
Great Britain as the global hegemon sometime between the two world
wars.]{.underline}]{.mark} Nevertheless, the United States and Britain
have been the closest of allies for now two hundred years. **[[Hegemony
was passed without conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**, indeed, in some
cases at the behest of Britain as the declining power. [[That is China's
model for East Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[China becomes
influential]{.underline}]{.mark} and respected [[not because it can beat
up the kids on the playground, but because the kids on the playground
trust China implicitly to protect]{.underline}]{.mark} personal and
property rights and permit [[fair play]{.underline}]{.mark}. They turn
to China for leadership, protection, financial support and
organizational guidance. China could be proud of itself for providing
these services. That is the true path to hegemony.

#### A transition is inevitable -- the sole factor that will determine hegemonic war is whether the US chooses to relinquish power

**Layne, 18** -- Christopher Layne is University Distinguished Professor
of International Affairs, and, Robert M. Gates Chair in National
Security, at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas
A&M University ("The US--Chinese power shift

and the end of the Pax Americana" International Affairs 94: 1 (2018)
89--111; doi: 10.1093/ia/iix249 **LRBIO = Liberal Rules Based
International Order**

When the balance of power swings---or is perceived to swing---in its
direction, a rising power becomes increasingly dissatisfied with the
international order, and seeks to revise it. The challenger wants to
change the rules embodied in the existing international order---rules
written, of course, by the once dominant but now declining Great Power
that created it. It also wants the allocation of prestige and status
changed to reflect its newly acquired power. The incumbent hegemon, of
course, wants to preserve the existing international order as is---an
order that it midwifed to advance, and consolidate, its own interests.
The E. H. Carr Moment presents [the incumbent hegemon]{.underline} with
a choice. It [can dig in its heels and try to preserve the prevailing
order]{.underline}---and its privileged position therein; [or it can
accede to the rising challenger's demands for revision. If it chooses
the former course of action, it runs the risk of war]{.underline} with
the dissatisfied challenger. If it chooses the latter, it must come to
terms with the reality of its decline, and the end of its hegemonic
position.

The E. H. Carr Moment is where the geopolitical rubber meets the road:
the status quo power(s) must choose between accommodating or opposing
the revisionist demands of the rising power(s). Liberal
internationalists such as John Ikenberry argue that China will not
challenge the current international order, even as the distribution of
power continues to shift in its favour. This is a doubtful proposition.
[The geopolitical question]{.underline}---the E. H. Carr Moment---[of
our time is whether the declining hegemon]{.underline} in east Asia, the
United States, [will try to preserve a status quo that is becoming
increasingly out of sync with the shifting distribution of power, or
whether it can reconcile itself to a rising China's revisionist
demands]{.underline} that the international order in east Asia be
realigned to reflect the emerging power realities. [Unless the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [can adjust gracefully to this
tectonic geopolitical shift, **the chances of a Sino-American war are
high**]{.underline}---as they always are during power transitions.92
[However, whether change comes peacefully or violently, the Pax
Americana's days are numbered]{.underline}.

#### Decline is inevitable - the transition is only violent if the US rejects retrenchment

**MacDonald and Parent, 18 --** Paul MacDonald is Associate Professor in
Political Science at Wellesley College. Joseph M. Parent is associate
professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame
([Twilight of the Titans: Great Power Decline and
Retrenchment]{.underline}, p. 197

We predict [the rejection of retrenchment would result in foreign policy
crises of escalating frequency and severity.]{.underline} [Rising
powers]{.underline} or regional aggressors [would be more likely to call
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates\' [bluff, and deterring
these adversaries would require greater commitments of
resources]{.underline} [and more dramatic demonstrations of
resolve]{.underline}. [Foreign interventions would be more likely to
turn into quagmires]{.underline}, as American ambitions escalate and
local opposition hardens. [The gap between foreign commitments and
available resources would widen]{.underline}, requiring growing deficits
and crash rearmament programs rather than steady budgets and sensible
reforms. The evidence suggests that declining powers throughout history
have tried to avoid this dismal fate, but that they are not always able
to do so. **[Minor disputes can spiral into major
confrontations]{.underline}**; [domestic rancor can get out of hand;
leaders can make poor decisions; things fall apart. Whether cur- rent
U.S. policymakers will dodge these dangers depends on how well they
learn the lessons of retrenchment]{.underline}.

#### Limited conventional power ensures a stable peaceful rise

intentions and trajectory: Will it opt for benevolent, coercive, or

Third, we identified signs of a possible "Third Way." It is similar to
the type of global hegemony defined and practised by the Dutch from the
late 16th to the mid-18th centuries. It would be [a global hegemony
solely focused on trade and financial concerns, without the interference
of violent conflicts or impositions of political and ideological norms
and values.]{.underline} From the Dutch-style vantage point[,
a]{.underline} [[Chinese hegemon would be]{.mark} relatively
[neutral]{.mark} in terms of ideology, partially uninvolved in the
management of the international state system, and mostly interested in
profit-maximisation, [without]{.mark} the use (or threat) of [military
actions]{.mark}. In sum, calm and stable political, economic, and
security environments are welcome news to Chinese strategists in the
short and medium run.]{.underline} Why is that the case? Ideologically
speaking, China cannot be a benevolent hegemon, and [[militarily and
politically speaking,]{.mark} it **[lacks the]{.mark} type of
[conventional power]{.mark}** and reputation [for exerting]{.mark} the
kind of [global influence necessary to manage the international
state]{.mark} and market systems.]{.underline} Regarding ideology, Yan
Xuetong argues, for example, that China will have to go beyond the
current trajectory of "combin\[ing\] Marxism with Chinese traditional
values" and instead "shape the international order by combining some
Chinese traditional values with selected liberalist values (...)
\[which\] could be acceptable to most countries because of their
universality" (Yan, 2018, p. 1). It is difficult to define China\'s
future hegemonic role and its general systemic behaviour accurately.
However, as this article argued, [the "Third Hegemonic Way" or
Dutch-style hegemony is highly instructive in this context. Accordingly,
this third alternative proposition adds to the current debate and
inventory of plausible explanation of China\'s peaceful or violent rise
as either a benevolent or potentially coercive hegemon.]{.underline} We
argued that [Dutch-style hegemony might be the **most viable way** for
China to proceed in its global hegemonic ascendancy]{.underline}.
Although China has registered a substantial economic and financial
growth since 1989, [its population still possesses]{.underline},
relative to other global great powers, [**lower per capita income** and
relatively small purchasing power]{.underline}. In this vein, the
relatively inexpensive labour cost and its mainly export-oriented
economy still figure as China\'s main engine of economic and financial
growth. [Further, [China\'s national market remains quite small]{.mark}
in terms of per capita purchasing power. Hence, [it needs peaceful,
stable, and]{.mark} relatively [prosperous]{.mark} international
[economic and state]{.mark} [systems to continue]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
thrive and to [grow]{.mark}. We project that **[China\'s leadership
will]{.mark} make sure [to keep it that way.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Also, [[China\'s]{.mark} incomplete and **[unbalanced]{.mark} power
[inventory]{.mark}** [renders it too weak militarily]{.mark} as a
near-hegemon [to compete aggressively]{.mark} against the United
State]{.underline}s. Further, [China would be considerably less
competitive if it has to face a potential military alliance among the
United States, Western Europe, India, and possibly Russia]{.underline}.
In summary, [[China]{.mark} [must remain]{.mark} commercially active and
**[militarily peaceful]{.mark}** [on the bases of its]{.mark} economic
prowess and its [conventional military competitive
disadvantage]{.mark}]{.underline} 13 vis-à-vis the United States and its
potential allies. Hence, Dutch-style hegemony is a perfect fit for
China\'s immediate and mid-range future. Accordingly, the study
concludes that, although it is exceedingly difficult to predict with a
high degree of certainty which way China will go in the future,
[Dutch-style hegemony is the most plausible explanation of China\'s
direction and role in the international system]{.underline}. However,
plausibility does not mean certainty; thus, we are mindful of
conflicting evidence that simultaneously points to either China\'s
peaceful (benevolent intentions) or violent rise (coercive intentions).
Despite the evidence supporting all three possible future trajectories,
the Third Way or the Dutch style is mor[e congruent with China\'s
international behaviour since 2001. [China]{.mark} [does not]{.mark}
truly [challenge]{.mark} [the existing order in terms of political
values, ideological norms, or regime types]{.mark}. The
"[Beijing]{.mark} [Consensus]{.mark}" [promotes trading]{.mark} with any
country, **[irrespective to]{.mark} the [political
system]{.mark}**]{.underline}, that is, governments raging from liberal
democracies, such as the United States, to staunch totalitarian
dictatorships such as Cuba, North Korea, and Venezuela. [China\'s focus
is **on sovereignty and not on regime type**.]{.underline} As Suisheng
Zhao argues, [China is in fact "\[e\]**mbracing the Westphalian
principles** of state sovereignty, (...) while adapting to the liberal
norms of globalization, China is (...) dissatisfied not with the
fundamental rules of the order but its status in the hierarchy of the
order" (2018, p. 643).]{.underline}

The episode discussed above is instructive for present United
States--Chinese relations and economic rivalry. Because they are
competing for global hegemony, they must be careful about whom they
trade with and how this may or may not undercut the political and
strategic interests of the other. It is mainly the case with China who
chooses to ignore U.S. sanctions against some rogue states such as Cuba,
Iran, North Korea, Russia, and Venezuela. In terms of present general
probability, [it [does not seem likely]{.mark} that [China]{.mark} [will
take over]{.mark} the [leadership of the U.S.-]{.mark}instituted liberal
economic and political global order as the Americans did from the
British in the early 20th century]{.underline}. Notwithstanding, much of
China\'s hegemonic trajectory could also depend on how it will develop
internally in terms of its economy and politics. In this sense, for
example, Shambaugh (2016) argues in his China\'s Future for reforms of
the Chinese party-state to softer authoritarianism. Further, [it seems
**[unlikely]{.mark} that [China will institute its leadership and global
hegemony via violent conflict]{.mark}**, much like Napoleonic France,
Wilhelmine Germany, and Imperial Japan]{.underline}. Instead, as
expounded above, the Dutch-style (or "Third Way") global hegemony
appears to be a more likely trajectory. [[Provided]{.mark}, of course,
[China remains]{.mark} to exhibit strictly [trade-oriented, politically
neutral, and self-interested]{.mark} pecuniary intentions in the next
decade.]{.underline}

greatest of all American philosophers (immortalized in baseball's Hall

verge of either of ruling the world, or becoming a global hegemon
comparable to the United States after the Second World War; not yet,
anyway]{.underline}. Thus, [for the next several decades (at least) it
will be **neither China's world nor America's**: international
leadership will be contested.]{.underline}81 During this period,
[China]{.underline} can be expected to act pretty much as one would
expect any Great Power to act while making the shift from rising to
risen: it [will use its newfound power to seek a much greater voice in
managing---and shaping---the interna- tional order, and its underlying
norms]{.underline}. For example, China will want others to acknowledge
its 'core interests', including respect for its territorial integrity
and its sovereignty. [Beijing has expanded the geographic scope of its
core interests beyond Tibet and Taiwan to include the South and East
China Seas and Xinjiang]{.underline}. And, reflecting its insistence
that states should refrain from intervening in others' internal affairs,
preservation of its political, economic and social systems also has been
defined as a core interest.82 During the period of contested
international leadership there is unlikely to be wholesale abandonment
of the post-1945 international institutions. For example, as one of the
five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Beijing is an
acknowledged part of the Great Power club. Similarly, we should not
expect to see a dramatic overhaul of the international economic system.

superseded by new 'made in China' institutions). [In this respect, China
will position itself as the developing world's champion---a role for
which it is well suited. Like many nations in the developing world---
but unlike the United States---China has been a victim of western Great
Power policies of imperialism and colonialism. As such, China has a
claim to prominence in constructing a new international order that
reflects the values of the developing world rather than those of the

#### US retrenchment prevents war from status competition and gives China a peaceful stake in the [current]{.underline} order 

**Ward, 17** - Assistant Professor of Government at Cornell University
(Steven, [Status and the Challenge of Rising Powers]{.underline}, p.
217-218

The former approach is one that few policymakers and scholars openly
promote.23 [If the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is
interested in avoiding the creation of a deeply revisionist,
anti-Western China, it needs to accommodate China's status
claims]{.underline}. Since these likely include the right to a sphere of
influence in East Asia, [accommodation would likely have to involve a
reduction of the American military presence and American
influence]{.underline} in that region. This does not mean conceding
global leadership to China. Rather, the aim would be to acknowledge that
China, as a great power, deserves the same rights that the United States
does in world politics -- including the right to manage East Asia and
the South China Sea the way that the United States manages Latin America
and the Caribbean.

This approach carries with it great risks and costs as well.What would
be the effect on navigation and trade through the South China Sea? Would
important American allies like Japan and South Korea turn into Beijing's
vassals? What if an American withdrawal from East Asia produces a
regional arms race? And what if China grows more ambitious rather than
more satisfied as the United States withdraws overseas?

But accommodation/[retrenchment]{.underline} also has some important
advantages. Foremost among them is that it **[avoids antagonizing
Beijing]{.underline}**: it is premised upon the idea that, all else
equal, [accommodation is preferable to denial because **denial activates
forces that empower hardliners**]{.underline}. [Accommodation holds out
the possibility of empowering moderates and facilitating China's
integration within a reformed version of the liberal international
order]{.underline} that has served its economic interests well. Another
advantage is that accommodation/ retrenchment is cheaper than any
approach involving containment. Retrenchment would reduce American
military expenditures while simultaneously creating incentives for other
regional powers to bear a greater share of their defense burdens. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [could return to an offshore
balancing posture, which would allow it to redeploy to the region only
if China tried]{.underline} to overthrow the new version of the status
quo order by, say [launching a war]{.underline} in East Asia. But [by
not signaling status denial, Washington would short circuit one of the
**major causes of radical revisionist challenges in
history**]{.underline}, [thereby reducing the likelihood that active
onshore balancing would be necessary]{.underline}.

#### Decline in US material power reduces the risk of war with China

**White, 17** -- Professor of Strategic Studies at the Strategic and
Defence Studies Centre of the Australian National University in
Canberra, Australia, (Hugh, "Without America", Quaterly Essay 68,
November,
https://www.quarterlyessay.com.au/essay/2017/11/without-america/extract

For almost a decade now, the world's two most powerful countries have
been competing over which of them will dominate the world's most
important and dynamic region. America has been trying to remain East
Asia's primary power, and China has been trying to replace it. Their
contest is playing out over trade deals and infrastructure plans, in the
diplomacy of multilateral meetings, and above all through military
gamesmanship in regional hotspots like the South China Sea, the East
China Sea and the Korean Peninsula. But all these are really just
symptoms of their underlying rivalry.

[How the contest will proceed -- whether peacefully or
violently]{.underline}, quickly or slowly -- [is still uncertain, but
the most likely outcome is now becoming clear. America will lose, and
China will win]{.underline}. [America will cease to play a major
strategic role in Asia, and China will take its place as the dominant
power. War remains possible, especially with someone like]{.underline}
Donald [Trump]{.underline} in the Oval Office. **[But the risk of war
recedes]{.underline}** [as it becomes **clearer that the odds are
against America,**]{.underline} [and as people in Washington come to
understand that their nation cannot defend its leadership in Asia by
fighting an unwinnable war with China. **The probability therefore grows
that America will peacefully**]{.underline}, and perhaps even willingly,
[withdraw]{.underline}. Indeed, **[this is already
happening]{.underline}**, and Asia is changing as a result. The old
US-led order is passing, and [a new China-led order is taking its
place]{.underline}.

This is not what anyone expected. Seven years ago, in Quarterly Essay
39, I argued that as power shifted from Washington to Beijing, and as
China's ambitions for leadership in Asia grew, America faced a contest
in Asia which it would be unable to win outright. Its best option,
therefore, would be to negotiate a new regional order, retaining a
lesser but still substantial strategic role in Asia which would balance
China's power, limit its influence and prevent East Asia falling under
Chinese hegemony.

Many people disagreed. They argued that America's power would remain so
much greater than China's that it was unnecessary for America to make
any such concessions. By holding firm, it could face down China,
convince it to back off and leave American leadership in Asia
unchallenged once more.

Alas, my critics and I were both wrong. We were slow to see the growing
rivalry between America and China, and we didn't recognise, or permit
ourselves to acknowledge, how serious the rivalry has become, and how
badly it has been going for America. That is because we all
underestimated China's power and resolve, and overestimated America's.
[Not only is America failing to remain the dominant power, it is failing
to retain any substantial strategic role at all]{.underline}. Many
expected that China would falter before it grew strong enough to
challenge America on anything like equal terms. Instead, [China has kept
growing stronger, economically, militarily and diplomatically, and
America's resolve has weakened]{.underline}. [Now it is China that is
facing down America]{.underline}. That was the clear message of Xi
Jinping's remarkable assertion of China's status and power at the
Nineteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, in October
2017. The contest is indeed unequal, but not in the way we thought. So
we find ourselves in a new Asia, and we do not like it. But that's the
hand history is dealing us, and we must make the best of it.

Then came [the]{.underline} global financial and [economic crisis
of]{.underline} 2007--20[08]{.underline}. The [world no longer seemed
unipolar]{.underline} as far as the eye could see. The [Great
Recession]{.underline}--- **[coupled with the rise of China, India, and
a resurgent Russia]{.underline}**---[cast doubts on the **state of
American relative power**]{.underline} that found official expression in
the US National Intelligence Council's Global Trends 2025 and Global
Trends 2030 reports.72 It has become [commonplace to claim that **the
unipolar era is over**]{.underline} or fast winding down. [Predictions
of]{.underline} continuing [unipolarity]{.underline} have been
[superseded by **premonitions of American decline**]{.underline} and
emerging multipolarity.73 Indeed, a February 2016 Gallop poll found
[Americans]{.underline} [**evenly split** when asked if the United
States is No. 1 in the world militarily]{.underline}, with 49% saying
'yes' and 49% saying 'no'. The poll also showed that [half of Americans
see the United States as one of several leading mili- tary
powers.]{.underline}74 [This widely held perception of **coming
structural change**]{.underline} largely [explains the appeal
of]{.underline} Donald Trump's '**[American First']{.underline}**
doctrine. Simply put, [the American era is]{.underline}
[over]{.underline}, and **[Washington must devise a new grand strategy
to deal with the new situation.]{.underline}**75 Realism, which the
American body politic has sup- ported for decades, offers just such a
strategy.76

An [Inward-Looking Nationalism]{.underline} **[Takes Root]{.underline}**

The [public]{.underline} rightly [sees emerging multipolarity as a more
competitive realm]{.underline} than the unipolar world that the United
States has enjoyed since 1991. The people [see]{.underline} America's
**[dismal record in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya]{.underline}** [and
understand that the United States]{.underline} **[has no vital interests
at stake]{.underline}** [in the places it has chosen to
intervene]{.underline}, [let alone the capacity]{.underline}---military
or otherwise---**[to fix the problems]{.underline}** afflicting those
countries.77 A [majority of Americans]{.underline} now [say]{.underline}
that the **[United States should be less engaged]{.underline}** in world
affairs and, for the first time in recorded history,
[believe]{.underline} that their [**country has a declining influence**
on what is happening around the globe.]{.underline} Americans are
[rejecting]{.underline} **[hard power and high politics]{.underline}**;
in their eyes, [history is shaped more by networks of
peoples]{.underline} spontaneously gathering in squares [than by the
military capabilities of powerful states.]{.underline}78 An April 2016
Pew poll found that [57% of Americans agree]{.underline} that the
**[United States should 'deal with its own problems and let others deal
with theirs the best they can]{.underline}**'.79

#### The US must transition to [offshore balancing]{.underline} to ensure [primacy]{.underline} and a stable [balance of power]{.underline}

[A 'flatter' international structure compels]{.underline} the [United
States to play a **less central role**]{.underline} in providing
functional services---generating public goods, stabilizing mar- kets,
and promoting cooperation. Pax Americana---[the integrated militarized
sys- tem of alliances and economic relationships t]{.underline}hat
[institutionalized American leadership]{.underline} of the non-Communist
world---**[is coming to a close]{.underline}**. [Global leadership is
costly]{.underline}; it means [asking your citizens to pay for others'
well-being]{.underline}, to [send young soldiers to die in faraway
places.]{.underline} So far, China [has shown little interest in
replacing the United States as a kind of chairman of planet
Earth,]{.underline} in the words of Daniel Russel, an American diplomat
who served as the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and
Pacific Affairs from 2013 to 2017; the Chinese display 'no intention of
emulating the U.S. as a provider of global goods or as an arbiter who
teases out universal principles and common rules'.88 As it enters this
new leaderless age, [Washington must devise a grand
strategy]{.underline} that **[properly deals]{.underline}** [with the
new situation,]{.underline} one that fundamentally alters America's role
in the new world.89

[Realists have proposed]{.underline} just such a change in American
grand strategy---a f[oreign policy approach t]{.underline}hat
essentially [falls under the rubric o]{.underline}f '**[offshore
balancing]{.underline}**'. Under this grand strategy, the [United States
would **no longer attempt to police the planet**]{.underline}.
[Instead]{.underline}, Washington would [encourage]{.underline} **[other
countries to take the lead]{.underline}** [in checking]{.underline}
**[rising powers]{.underline}** in Europe, Northeast Asia, and the
Persian Gulf, [interven- ing itself only when absolutely necessary to
**preserve the regional balance of power**]{.underline}. Calibrating its
military posture according to the distribution of power in the three key
regions, the United States would [allow]{.underline} **[regional forces
to be its first line of defense]{.underline}** [in the event that a
potential regional hegemon emerges.]{.underline} This means, as Barry
Posen maintains, 'demobiliz\[ing\] most U.S. Army troops based abroad'
and closing most US bases across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East---
about 800 of them in more than 70 countries.90

By [passing the costs to more threatened allies]{.underline},
**[offshore balancing aims to pre- serve US primacy far into the
future]{.underline}** [and safeguard liberty at home. As]{.underline}
John Glaser points out, 'A [globe-straddling forward-deployed military
presence]{.underline} is a **[costly burden that elevates peripheral
interests]{.underline}** to the level of vital ones, takes on security
responsibilities that can and should be fulfilled by other states, and
pro- duces negative unintended consequences for U.S. interests.'91 [The
trick]{.underline}, however, [is implementing a **retrenchment
strategy**]{.underline}---that is, [how to wean the world off of
American power]{.underline} **[while avoiding a hard
landing]{.underline}** (e.g. regional arms races and intense security
dilemmas). Even with the most skilled leadership, we should expect a
very bumpy ride.

We see this happening already. Trump's visit to Asia created unease
among allies about the role the United States will play in the
Asia-Pacific region. [Seeking Beijing's help to deal with North
Korea,]{.underline} President T[rump failed to press China on its
military buildup in the South China Sea, reinforcing the perception that
America is beginning to retrea]{.underline}t from the region and, quite
understandably, fueling Japan's underlying fear of abandonment. Tokyo
now strongly suspects that the United States may make some kind of deal
with China that could put Japan at a disadvantage.

As Japan and China recognize the altered dynamics around the Pacific
Rim, some observers believe that they may inch toward a possible
reconciliation. Such a Sino-Japanese rapprochement is unlikely, however,
given their long-standing historical enmity. Negative attitudes toward
Japan are widespread among main- land Chinese. According to a recent Pew
survey, less than 10% of Chinese think that Japan can be trusted---and
the feeling is mutual. Young Chinese, who did not personally experience
the war, express surprisingly vehement anti-Japanese
feelings---sentiments that are due in no small part to state propaganda
and patri- otic education in schools that make criticism of Japan
politically correct.92 Moreover, the Chinese see themselves as the
natural hegemon, and in their--- worldview, the Japanese should be
subordinate to them---in other words, Chinese elites refuse to accept
Japan's legitimacy as a major Asian state. Neither Shinzo Abe nor his
successors will tolerate such a future for Japan, which is why Japan is
offering maritime and development assistance to countries like Vietnam
and the Philippines. Ultimately, however, China's rise and America's
retreat to a more offshore posture will force into existence a military
alliance between Japan and India (and, perhaps, Russia as well) to
restore a regional balance of power to counter growing Chinese power.

In conclusion, [the key to managing the future of US--Chinese strategic
rivalry is prudence and perspective]{.underline}. [Short of a military
confrontation]{.underline} on the Chinese lit- toral with the United
States and its allies, [China is unlikely to avail itself of the
elements of its A2/AD capabilities]{.underline} that could be deployed
to materially block free- dom of navigation and overflight operations
(e.g. sinking vessels or shooting down aircraft). Recognizing this fact,
[US leaders would be wise to]{.underline} **[heed the nonin-
terventionist vision of US foreign polic]{.underline}**y espoused by
Secretary of State John Quincy Adams [and]{.underline}, accordingly,
[not go]{.underline} '**[abroad in search of monsters to
destroy]{.underline}**'.93 Remaining alert to possible security threats
emanating from China's East and South China Seas policies, Washington
must place such threats in per- spective. As Benjamin Herscovitch puts
it, 'no armies are being launched into bat- tle, no civilians are being
slaughtered, and no cities are being reduced to rubble'.94 [A balanced
threat assessment of an outward-looking China suggests]{.underline}
[that it poses only a modest danger to American vital
interests]{.underline}. If prudence prevails on both sides, a **[stable
regional balance of power will emerge among the local
states]{.underline}**---[one nested within an even more stable
Sino-American bipolar system]{.underline} that, unlike its US--Soviet
predecessor, is not rooted in a zero-sum battle between the totalist
ideological tenets of Marxism-Leninism and Western-style democratic
capitalism.

#### Trying to maintain the [US LED]{.underline} order fails and [ensures extinction]{.underline}. China can be [integrated]{.underline} into the world order BUT only if the US takes a step back

[It may be easy]{.underline}, and perhaps natural, [for the would-be
architects]{.underline} of the new system to [organize it around
Washington]{.underline}. But **[that would be a mistake]{.underline}**.
[The enemies of this new order]{.underline}, **[united by their
resentment of the United States]{.underline}**, [will seek to discredit
it]{.underline} **[as just another effort to dominate global
affairs.]{.underline}** For this new order to be viable[, it must be
conceived in such a way that]{.underline} **[the charge is
false.]{.underline}**

The new order [must also be decentralized to be effective]{.underline};
the [resources and wisdom needed to solve many vexing
problems]{.underline} are **[not concentrated in the United
States]{.underline}**. For instance, on the enormous issue of defining
rules for a digitized world, [Washington has been **confused and
passive,**]{.underline} despite---or perhaps because of---its dominance
in such commerce. It is the European Union that has led the way. The
EU's General Data Protection Regulation, its Digital Services Act, and
its Digital Markets Act created the standards that influence most of the
world, including the Americas. Decentralized leadership has also proved
critical to responding to Russia's aggression in Ukraine. The [nucleus
of the emerging pro-Ukraine coalition]{.underline}, for instance, is
[not just the United States but the entire G-7,]{.underline} including
the European Commission. South Korea and Australia should be invited to
join this coalition as well.

Yet a [revised system of world order shouldn't be limited]{.underline}
**[to the United States and its traditional allies]{.underline}**. [It
must be open to any countries that can and will help attain its common
objectives. I]{.underline}ndia should have a place at any symbolic high
table, for example, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
But India's leaders are still making their choices about their will and
capacity to work on common problems. Even **[China should be welcome at
the table.]{.underline}** After much internal debate in the early 1990s,
[China's leaders chose to play a major and often **constructive role in
the global commonwealth system**]{.underline} that emerged after the end
of the Cold War. In 2005, Zoellick famously urged Beijing to become a
"responsible stakeholder." As late as 2017, Kurt Campbell, who now leads
Asia policy for the Biden White House, thought this invitation was a
wise move.

But Zoellick's words were a challenge, one that Beijing is failing to
meet. China's partnership with Putin---whom Xi described to the Russian
press as "my best and bosom friend"---is the opposite of responsible.
Instead, it shows that China and Russia lead a primarily Eurasian
grouping of dangerous states, including the likes of Iran, North Korea,
and Pakistan. Their loose confederation has its cross-purposes and is
united mainly by hostility toward the United States. But it is building
tighter links, better divisions of labor, and more effective
coordination than existed among the Axis powers before or during World
War II.

For these and other reasons, [pessimists believe China is irredeemably
hostile]{.underline}. They argue that China has written off the United
States as a country determined to resist China's rise and that Chinese
leaders may feel they have little to lose by embracing confrontation. In
this pessimistic view, China is trying to shift from the post--Cold War
era's emphasis on global interdependence toward a Chinese grand strategy
of Eurasian dominance and growing national self-sufficiency. China's
leaders are now using the pandemic to keep a chokehold on international
travel and strengthen domestic surveillance.

That does seem to be China's current plan. But it is **[unclear whether
this plan will work]{.underline}**. It [rests on unproven social,
political, and economic premises]{.underline} that are [starting to
deeply disturb parts of Chinese society]{.underline} essential to its
past and future success---such as the many residents of Shanghai who
have been trapped during the city's draconian recent lockdown.

[Chinese leaders may]{.underline} also have [noticed that, in backing
the Putin regime]{.underline}, they have [tethered themselves to an
adventurist Russian government]{.underline} that, for 30 years, has
treated its neighbors much as Japan treated China between 1915 and 1945.
For instance, Putin insists that Russia is not invading Ukraine. There
is no war, he declared; there is only a "special military operation."
Many Chinese people will recall that, from 1937 to 1941, Japan insisted
that it, too, was not invading China. There was no war, the Japanese
said; there was merely a "China incident."

Throughout the years of Japanese aggression, the United States defended
China's territorial integrity. Even amid times of misjudgment and
weakness, Washington maintained that stance, refusing in November 1941
to make a deal with Japan at China's expense. Ten days later, Japan went
to war against the United States. As they watch what is happening in
2022, Chinese leaders can still reflect on this past and consider what
decisions to make.

[If Beijing charts a new course,]{.underline} it **[would not be the
first time it has chosen to change.]{.underline}** But [if China does
rejoin a system of world order**, it should be a new one**]{.underline}.
Th[e old system has **fractured and must be remade**]{.underline}.
Facing tragic realities, [the citizens of the free world must rebuild a
global order]{.underline} that is **[practical enough to address the
most vital common problems]{.underline}**, even if it cannot and does
not promise progress on all the values and concerns people face. [This
system will be far more effective if]{.underline} **[the world's most
populous country joins it, and China faces another time of
choosing]{.underline}**. Regardless of China's participation,
responsible actors must begin the hard, substantive work of [protecting
the planet from]{.underline} **[war, climate, economic, and health
risks]{.underline}**. The time for rhetoric and posturing is over.

Both [Russia's scorched-earth invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} and the
[swift fury of the U.S.]{.underline} and European Union-led global
response **[seem to have come as a shock to Beijing]{.underline}**.
[China's]{.underline} ambiguous stance---clearly
[anti-American]{.underline} but not explicitly pro-Russian or
anti-Ukrainian---in part [comes]{.underline} **[because the West's
surprisingly strong response has frustrated Chinese
ambitions.]{.underline}**

It may not have fully sunk in yet in Beijing, but the resurgence of an
economic and strategically unified West, and the risk of the financial
and political liability of protecting a dependent, wrecked petrostate,
should lead Chinese President [Xi]{.underline} Jinping to [see the
wisdom of]{.underline} **[cooperating with the global economic
order]{.underline}**, [albeit with a **larger Chinese
voice**]{.underline} and modest distancing from its partner in Moscow.
Despite its echoing of Russian disinformation, [Beijing]{.underline} has
cautiously [cut off A]{.underline}sian [I]{.underline}nfrastructure
[I]{.underline}nvestment [B]{.underline}ank [loans and trade financing
to Moscow,]{.underline} and China's state-run Sinopec halted gas and
petrochemical projects in Russia. With \$3 trillion in mostly dollar and
euro assets and watching the United States disappear Russian Central
Bank assets overnight, Beijing's caution is understandable.

But **[would the United States accept inclusion of a more
cooperative]{.underline}** China if Beijing changed course and used it
leverage to help resolve the Ukraine question? Given
[relentless]{.underline} U.**[S. indictment of Chinese
behavior]{.underline}** on Ukraine, even before China has taken any
actual moves to aid Moscow, [Xi could be forgiven for thinking that the
answer is]{.underline}: probably **[no]{.underline}**t.

I've never quite understood the endgame of the many
[efforts]{.underline} to forge common cause solely with democracies on
global trade, technology, and all things digital. I thought the point
was to position the United States to shape global rules and
standards---which means [accepting]{.underline} major **[authoritarian
economies]{.underline}** [in that order]{.underline}, **[lest a
dangerous race to the bottom]{.underline}** [from a]{.underline}
**[fragmented order]{.underline}** of competing rules and standards
ensues.

The [unified public and private sector sanctions]{.underline} placed on
Russia underscore the imperative of reaching consensus on rules and
standards with allies and like-minded partners to the degree possible.
It's a smart U.S. starting point, a force multiplier for U.S. leverage.
And in strategic areas of supply chain security and technology like 5G,
it can be a viable end goal. But what jumped out at me watching U.S.
President Joe Biden's Summit for Democracy last December was the
question of whether this is viewed as an end in itself across the board.
If the United States can, for example, reach a consensus with the EU and
Japan on World Trade Organization (WTO) reform or standards for
artificial intelligence[, should]{.underline}n't this [provide leverage
to **negotiate**]{.underline} with China, Russia, [and]{.underline}
others to shape [global norms?]{.underline}

Instead, the opposite appears more the conventional wisdom. In February,
when asked about consulting with the region on the recently released
U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Daniel
Kritenbrink said emphatically, "There is currently no intention to
engage the People's Republic of China on the Indo-Pacific Economic
Framework."

This is not a one-off aberration but tracks with the responses I get
when I ask senior administration officials, "Won't [this lead
to]{.underline} **[a more dangerous, divided world]{.underline}**? So
why not [test China's intentions at the **negotiating
table**]{.underline}?" The response, as one official put it, was, "Yeah,
we assume China won't change." Richard Fontaine, the CEO of the Center
for a New American Security, seemed to embrace this assumption in a
recent essay in Foreign Affairs, writing, "The aim of U.S. policy toward
China should be to ensure that Beijing is either unwilling or unable to
overturn the regional and global order." That assumes China seeks not
just to tilt rules in its direction but overturn the order on which its
economy depends.

Yet [China is **hardly impervious to change**]{.underline}. Aside from
12 major (and dozens of minor) dynasties over the past 4,000 years,
since the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) took power in 1949, there have
been no shortages of major shifts. There was Mao Zedong's Great Leap
Forward, a catastrophic collectivization campaign launched in 1958 that
led to some 30 million Chinese starving to death. That was preceded by
Mao's "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" campaign to encourage diverse, new
thinking---but then Mao cut the flowers with an anti-rightist campaign
against those who spoke out.

In 1966, to reassert control over what he feared was a bureaucratizing
CCP government, Mao started the disastrous Cultural Revolution,
empowering Chinese youth (so-called Red Guards) to attack the CCP
bureaucracy, institutions, and intellectuals. Nearly 2 million people
were killed and millions imprisoned or tortured, disrupting a generation
and setting China back. The led to the reform period. After Mao had a
stroke in 1972, Deng Xiaoping gradually took the reins of power,
following internal CCP struggles against Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, and the
"Gang of Four." Market-oriented reforms took off, first with incremental
experiments and then writ large, with Deng proclaiming, "To get rich is
glorious." Collective leadership followed, implementing change, until
Xi's rise and his "rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," undoing some
market reforms and Deng's restrained foreign policy. The reactionary
trend of policy under Xi is, in fact, a sign that [China is capable of
change---in both directions.]{.underline}

But [even a post-Xi leadership is **unlikely to see any incentive to
change** if it believes the United States]{.underline} **[has no
interest in seeing it or in reaching accommodations with China in a
viable international order.]{.underline}** Despite the wild political
roller coaster of CCP rule, much of the deluge of commentary by the
post-engagement commentariat seems to view the party as a monolithic,
relentless force. There may be some truth in Xi's own inflexibility.
Though he has eliminated many rivals, Xi has his share of enemies and,
as noted above, a CCP history of course changes. There are hints of
discontent: Recent extraordinary articles by a Central Committee member
and a leading party school official, respectively, praising Deng's
reforms and not mentioning Xi were widely discussed in China.

[If the United States wants an international order,]{.underline} [rather
than,]{.underline} as Princeton University's Aaron Friedberg recently
proposed, [a "partial liberal order]{.underline}," [it has to offer
states such as China **some stake in that order**]{.underline}. [The
logic of "democracies only]{.underline}" could **[lead to a bifurcated
or maybe trifurcated world]{.underline}** (the EU has a different
philosophy on regulation) with dueling trade rules and tech standards.

### 2nc \-\-- AT: Cling to Heg/Transition Wars

#### Cling to hegemony isn't inevitable -- we have the newest, most comprehensive research

**MacDonald and Parent, 18 --** Paul MacDonald is Associate Professor in
Political Science at Wellesley College. Joseph M. Parent is associate
professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame
([Twilight of the Titans: Great Power Decline and
Retrenchment]{.underline}, p. 2-3

In this book, we argue that [the conventional wisdom is
wrong]{.underline}. Specifically, we make three main arguments. First,
[relative decline causes prompt, proportionate retrenchment because
states seek strategic solvency]{.underline}. [The international system
is a competitive place, and great powers did not get to the top by being
imprudent]{.underline}, irrational, or irresponsible. [When their
fortunes ebb, states]{.underline} tend to [retain the virtues that made
them great]{.underline}. In the face of decline, great powers have a
good sense of their relative capability and tend not to give away more
than they must. Expanding or [maintaining grand strategic ambitions
during decline incurs unsustainable burdens and incites unwinnable
fights]{.underline}, so the faster states fall, the more they retrench.
[Great powers]{.underline} may choose to [retrench]{.underline} in other
circumstances as well, but they have an overriding incentive to do so
[when confronted by relative decline]{.underline}.

Second, the depth of relative decline shapes not only how much a state
retrenches, but also which policies it adopts. The world is complex and
cut- throat; leaders cannot glibly pull a policy off the shelf and
expect desired outcomes. Because international politics is a self-help
system, great powers prefer policies that rely less on the actions of
allies and adversaries. For lack of a better term, we refer to these as
domestic policies, which include reducing spending, restructuring
forces, and reforming institutions---all to reallocate resources for
more efficient uses. But international policies may also help, and they
include redeploying forces, defusing flashpoints, and redistributing
burdens---all to avoid costly conflicts and reinforce core strong-
points. [The faster and deeper states fall, the more they are willing to
rely on others to cushion their fall]{.underline}. Retrenchment is not a
weapon but an arsenal that can be used in different amounts and
combinations depending on con- ditions and the enemies faced.

Third, after depth, structural conditions are the most important factors
shaping how great powers respond to relative decline. Four conditions
catalyze the incentives for declining states to retrench. One is the
declining state\'s rank. States in the top rungs of the great power
hierarchy have more resources and margin for error than those lower
down, so there is less urgency for them to retrench. Another is the
availability of allies. [Where states can shift burdens to capable
regional powers]{.underline} with similar preferences, [retrenchment is
less risky]{.underline} and difficult. Yet another is the
interdependence of commitments. When states perceive commitments in one
place as tightly linked to commitments elsewhere, pulling back becomes
harder and less likely. The last catalyst is the calculus of conquest.
If aggression pays, then retrenchment does not, and great powers will be
loath to do it. The world is not just complex and cutthroat, it is also
dynamic. No set of conditions is everlasting, and leaders must change
with the times.

[Empirically, this work aims to add value by being the **first to study
systematically all modern shifts in the great power pecking
order**]{.underline}. [We find sixteen cases of relative decline since
1870,]{.underline} [when reliable data for the great powers become
available, and compare them to their non-declining
counterparts]{.underline} across a variety of measures. To preview the
findings, [retrenchment is by far the most common response to relative
decline]{.underline}, and declining powers behave differently from
non-declining powers. [States in decline are more likely to cut the size
of their military forces]{.underline} and budgets and in extreme cases
are more likely to form alliances. This does not, however, make them
ripe for exploitation; declining states perform comparatively well in
militarized disputes. Our headline finding, however, is that states that
retrench recover their prior rank with some regularity, but those that
fail to retrench never do. These results challenge theories of grand
strategy and war, offer guidance to policymakers, and indicate
overlooked paths to peace.

forward-deployed military presence is a costly burden that elevates
peripheral interests to the level of vital ones]{.underline}, takes on
security responsibilities that can and should be fulfilled by other
states, and produces negative unintended consequences for U.S.

most skilled leadership, we should expect a very bumpy ride.

**[We see this happening already]{.underline}**. [Trump's visit to Asia

deal with North Korea, President [Trump failed to press China on its
military buildup in the South China Sea, reinforcing the perception that
America is beginning to retreat]{.underline} from the region and, quite
understandably, fueling Japan's underlying fear of abandonment. Tokyo
now strongly suspects that the United States may make some kind of deal
with China that could put Japan at a disadvantage.

### 2nc \-\-- AT: Offensive Realism

#### Realism is [broadly wrong]{.underline} -- oversimplifies and doesn't assume Chinese politics

International Relations (Frank, "Offensive Realism and the Rise of
China: A Useful Framework for Analysis?," *E-International Relations*,

Accessed 7-1-22, LASA-AH)

A comprehensive analytical framework found wanting In addition to the
empirical and theoretical issues presented above, [offensive realism
precludes two important levels of analysis when used as a tool for
studying the rise of China]{.underline}. In his influential book Man,
State, and War, Waltz (1954) conceived of three "images" of
international relations: individuals, the state, and the international
system. [Now, offensive realism is a **structural theory**. It holds
that state behaviour is determined by the anarchic structure of the
international system. Individual leaders and domestic politics are
excluded from consideration]{.underline}---[offensive realism is an
oversimplification of reality]{.underline}. As a consequence, the theory
will be of limited utility when personal beliefs or domestic politics
are the predominant variables which shape a state's foreign policy
(Mearsheimer, 2014, p. 10). When it comes to China, reasonable evidence
suggests that [individuals and their ideas may indeed dominate the
decision-making process]{.underline}. Chinese foreign policy has always
been shaped by its supreme leader's personal ideas. Although it is true
that the leader's role has become less significant from Mao Zedong to Hu
Jintao (Nathan and Scobell, 2014, pp. 37--38), there can be no doubt
that the rise of Xi Jinping, China's supreme leader since 2012, has
reversed this trend. "[Xi Jinping thought" has been included in the
Chinese Communist Party's constitution in the 19th National Congress in
October 2017 (Corre, 2018). And after an unprecedented centralisation of
power, Xi holds more sway than any other Chinese leader since
Mao]{.underline}. He has quelled dissenting voices, removed the term
limit for his office as president and established a personality cult
that bears resemblance to authoritarian leaders such as Vladimir Putin
in Russia or even Kim Jong Un in North Korea. [Hence, a sound
understanding of Xi is of much greater significance than it has been for
any of his immediate predecessors (Wasserstrom, 2021). Xi's rise to
power has been accompanied by what is described as an increasingly
assertive Chinese foreign policy]{.underline}. This was first noted in
2009 by various Chinese and foreign pundits (Friedberg, 2014, p. 133),
and has culminated in an unparalleled Chinese diplomatic offensive in
2020. The [Chinese Communist Party tightened its grip on Hong Kong and
passed a controversial national security law that has effectively
terminated the principle of "one country, two systems."]{.underline}
Chinese soldiers started a deadly brawl on the disputed border with
India. The Chinese military repeatedly probed Taiwan's air defences and
increased its patrols around the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands, which are
claimed by both China and Japan. Likewise, maritime presence in the
South China Sea was intensified. Domestically, [Beijing stepped up its
clampdown against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang in what many have described as
an attempt of cultural genocide]{.underline}. Finally, the Australian
government's request for an independent investigation into the roots of
the COVID-19 pandemic was met with harsh trade sanctions and
cyberattacks, and [Chinese diplomats started using very belligerent
language (Campbell and Rapp-Hooper, 2020).]{.underline} What may account
for this dramatic change of direction in the PRC's foreign policy?
Campbell and Rapp-Hooper (2020) have suggested that both Xi's belief
that the time to restore China's historical might has arrived and this
consolidation of power likely played a key role, while staunch
nationalism may have served as a catalyst. H. R. McMaster (2020), former
White House national security adviser, has similarly argued that the
[Chinese leadership is under the impression that its window of
opportunity to accomplish the "China dream" is narrowing]{.underline}.
He has also emphasised the importance of history when it comes to
understanding China. Small and Jaishankar (2020) have put forward four
conceivable explanations for the PRC's new assertiveness. [These
theories hold that weaknesses in the rest of the world, an
internalisation of the Chinese leaders' own success, a reaction to
current challenges posed by the pandemic or internal and external
insecurity could be the reason of China's diplomatic offensive. To date,
there is **no systemic analysis** which would attribute Beijing's newest
assertiveness to specific determinants on the individual, domestic or
structural level.]{.underline} However, Liao (2016) has employed a
classical levels of analysis approach to make sense of China's
assertiveness after 2009. According to his assessment, prevalent
structural and domestic explanations are not supported by empirical
evidence and thus fail to offer a plausible explanation. [Most
importantly, there was no correlation in time between adjustments of
international or domestic preconditions and China's increased
assertiveness.]{.underline} Thus, the analysis suggests that the
[perceptions and ideas of China's elite and the state leader's
preferences are the most convincing explanation for the changes in
Chinese foreign policy]{.underline} (Liao, 2016, pp. 831--833). It is
true that China's new assertiveness could also be part of a larger plan
to achieve the PRC's strategic objectives, as Friedberg (2014, pp.
143--146) has argued. In addition, the leadership argument is almost
impossible to refute (Liao, 2016, p. 829). But regardless of that, [the
evidence presented above strongly suggests that a single-level
perspective as offensive realism may be **too parsimonious** when it
comes to the analysis of the rise of China]{.underline}. In fact, even
Mearsheimer has dedicated one section of his chapter on China's rise to
"hypernationalism," which he expects to exacerbate the US-Chinese
security competition---whilst maintaining that realist logic will remain
the key factor (Mearsheimer, 2014, pp. 399--403). In this regard,
[realism appears to be not just a theory, but also an
ideology]{.underline}, [as McFaul has so aptly noted: Realism is devised
as a descriptive and a prescriptive theory; states ought to follow its
lessons in order to be successful in international affairs. Yet, this
would seem to **undercut the core argument of realism**---namely that
leaders and their beliefs are irrelevant (McFaul, 2020, p.
113).]{.underline}

#### Offensive realism looks [purely]{.underline} at military capabilities -- ignores economic concerns

Mearsheimer's Unduly Focus on Military Capabilities The third and final
reason why [offensive realism]{.underline} would seem to be of rather
limited utility in the analysis of the rise of China is the [theory's
unduly focus on military capabilities.]{.underline} [Mearsheimer grasps
at the concept of power only in a very narrow sense---**states'
capabilities are measured in purely military terms**]{.underline}
(Mearsheimer, 2014, p. 363). Although military potential is certainly
easy to estimate, [this view disregards other ways to wield power and
coerce one's adversaries]{.underline}---for instance by means of
economic warfare (Toft, 2005, p. 384). [In the context of US-China
relations, an **unabating focus on military force appears
problematic**]{.underline}; Mearsheimer's anticipated security
competition may actually play out in the economic arena, not in the
military domain. Indeed, a tech competition between China and the United
States is already well underway. Especially under Donald
[Trump's]{.underline} four-year tenure as United States president,
[previously uncontroversial economic cooperation has been increasingly
considered through the lens of national security.]{.underline} This has
led to a significant reappraisal of US-China relations; [the United
States believes that it is losing its competitive technological and
military edge due to close commercial ties with the PRC]{.underline}
(Foot and King, 2019, p. 47). Looking more closely at the rhetoric of
the Trump administration, it appears that both economic and civil
society ties have been successfully securitised (Abb, 2020). That is, a
reference object---i.e. economic relations with the PRC---has been
defined as an existential security threat that warrants emergency
measures outside the scope of normal political procedures (Buzan, Wæver
and Wilde, 1998, pp. 23--26). One of the most apparent examples for this
securitisation seems to be the 2017 US National Security Strategy
because it frames economic security explicitly as a national security
issue (United States, 2017, p. 17). The Trump administration has acted
accordingly. It imposed tough sanctions on the Chinese tech giant
Huawei, cutting the company off from technology manufactured in the
United States, including microprocessors (Abb, 2020, p. 2). After that,
in summer 2020, politicians in Washington discussed whether or not
TikTok---a social network owned by a Chinese company which is especially
popular among young teenagers---could pose a threat to national security
(Schuman, 2020). Some have even suggested that the White House should
declare a national emergency and invoke the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) if the ownership company ByteDance is not
willing to sell its service to a non-Chinese enterprise (Thompson,
2020). Subsequently, the People's Republic of China placed TikTok's
recommendation algorithm on its export control list (Mozur, Zhong and
McCabe, 2020). [As the Biden administration is reviewing Trump's China
policy, the tech war is currently on hold---at least with regard to
TikTok (Kruppa and Sevastopulo, 2021). But given that Joe Biden (2020)
has also embraced technological competition with China, it seems
reasonable to assume that the arms race for high-tech superiority is
here to stay.]{.underline} Other trends, for example the transition
toward renewable energy, [would also suggest that control over
technology and intellectual property rights will **become increasingly
more important** (Overland, 2019, p. 38).]{.underline}

[The Foundation for Offensive Realism appears doubtful.]{.underline} The
fundamental assumption of [Mearsheimer]{.underline}'s offensive realism
is a bold one. He [portrays great powers as revisionist predators in
pursuit of survival. The ultimate goal for any powerful state is to
attain regional hegemony---that is, being the strongest nation in its
part of the world]{.underline}. In addition, great powers also want to
make sure there are no contenders dominating other regions (Mearsheimer,
2014, p. 363). [This image is both persuasive and parsimonious, but
**not backed by empirical evidence.**]{.underline} In fact, rising
[states do not always seem to employ aggressive strategies toward their
declining competitors. Rather, history suggests that rising states even
**cooperate with their declining peers**.]{.underline} Although
Wilhelmine Germany competed with Great Britain for maritime primacy, it
also provided Austria-Hungary with diplomatic and military support in
the years before 1914[. Both the United States and the rising Soviet
Union attempted to support a weakening United Kingdom after the end of
World War II.]{.underline} Eventually, Britain received remarkable
economic, military and diplomatic assistance from the United States
(Shifrinson, 2020, pp. 176--177). But [the Soviet Union was also eager
to cooperate with the UK]{.underline}; it even explored the feasibility
of a formal military alliance with Britain in early 1947---more than one
year before the United States started to discuss a similar proposal
(Shifrinson, 2018, p. 90). Similarly, [a large body of literature on
power transitions apparently calls into question Mearsheimer's offensive
realist worldview,]{.underline} since [there appears to be only **a weak
link** between power shifts and the outbreak of war
(]{.underline}Shifrinson, 2020, p. 180). For example, Lebow and
Valentino (2009) not only found that power transitions are fairly
uncommon, but also that [power shifts are usually the effect of armed
conflicts---**not their cause**.]{.underline} [Great powers]{.underline}
traditionally eschew making war against their peers. Instead, they
[prefer to attack smaller states or **gravely declining
nations**]{.underline}. It is true that these smaller wars have
repeatedly escalated in ways that dragged other great powers into the
conflict as well (Lebow and Valentino, 2009, p. 406). But [these
conflicts---inadvertent escalations, so to speak---differ considerably
from the intense security competition which Mearsheimer is
anticipating]{.underline}. Most importantly, there is even research
indicating that [dominant military powers are **more likely than rising
states to start major conflict,** provided that they are apprehensive
about their loss of status]{.underline} (Copeland, 2000, p. 3). In sum,
empirical evidence suggests that [rising states adopt much more nuanced
strategies than offensive realism would predict]{.underline}. This seems
to hold true even for great powers with revisionist propensities
(Shifrinson, 2018, p. 181). One possible explanation for this divergence
between reality and what offensive realism teaches could be case
selection. [Indeed, Mearsheimer's case studies have been **suspected of
selection bias** by various scholars]{.underline} (Snyder, 2002, p. 161;
Toft, 2005, pp. 395--396). [It is also worth noting that---at odds with
Mearsheimer's predictions---NATO has yet to collapse (Kaplan, 2011).
Neither has Germany acquired nuclear weapons, nor is there a vicious
great power competition in Europe]{.underline} (Toft, 2005, p. 396). In
other words: [Mearsheimer has been off the mark by **a great
margin.**]{.underline} [Given the rather weak empirical basis and the
theory's debatable predictive ability, it would seem reasonable to
assume that offensive realism is **not particularly useful when it comes
to the analysis of the rise of China.**]{.underline} In fact, the
People's Republic of China does not seem to harbour expansionist
proclivities. It is true that China's territorial claims---e.g. Taiwan
or large swaths of the South China Sea---are substantial. In addition,
Chinese efforts to build artificial islands in the South China Sea have
been widely regarded as expansionist and aggressive by China's
neighbours. However, [Chinese territorial claims are all firmly rooted
in **historical possession or exploration,** not in offensive realist
thinking]{.underline} (Nathan and Scobell, 2014, p. 21; Yergin, 2020).
Besides that, theoretical insights from balance of power theory would
also cast doubt on offensive realism's core tenet, as Shifrinson (2020)
has noted. If rising powers were to engage in all-out predation on their
declining peers, they may expedite the formation of a sizable
counterbalancing coalition. In multipolar systems, a rising power may
also need assistance from other nations in its proximity to offset
challengers. [All-out predation on declining countries would seem to
foreclose future cooperation with other states and thus appears
strategically unwise]{.underline} (Shifrinson, 2020, pp. 181--183). For
these reasons, [rising states would seem to pursue more nuanced
strategies toward their declining peers.]{.underline} More to the point,
one would expect rising powers to follow either predatory or supportive
strategies in varying intensities---depending on the decliner's
strategic value and military posture, respectively (Shifrinson, 2018,
chap. 2). [Since China faces several challengers in its neighbourhood
with both India and Japan, and the United States is likely to retain a
robust military posture for the foreseeable future, it appears probable
that **China will exercise restraint**---or, in fact, may even want to
cooperate with the United States]{.underline} (Shifrinson, 2020, p.
199).

### 2nc \-\-- AT: Hostile China

#### Their read of Chinese motives is speculation without evidence

**Swaine, 17** -- senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace and one of the most prominent American analysts in
Chinese security studies (Michael, "Managing Asia's Security Threats in
the Trump Era" 1/19,
<http://carnegieendowment.org/publications/?fa=67746>

Regardless of its motives, China's more recent, escalatory behavior has
contributed significantly to the buildup in tensions in the disputed SCS
and ECS areas. Beijing has refused to specify the precise nature of its
claims both to individual land features and to the waters within the
nine-dashed line in the SCS, and it has rejected the above-mentioned
tribunal ruling (asserting that certain exceptions to such a ruling
under UNCLOS Article 298 apply). Further, China seemed to assert the
legal right of an archipelagic nation to draw boundary lines between the
Paracel and perhaps the Spratly Islands in order to establish interior
territorial waters, created sizable artificial islands with dual
civilian-military facilities in the Spratlys, and regularly deployed a
significant number of vessels and some aircraft near and sometimes into
the territorial space of the S/D Islands. Due to all of this,
[[many]{.mark} observers]{.underline} understandably [[assume the
worst-case for China's motives]{.underline}]{.mark}, ascribing them to
the much larger, more aggressive and confrontational strategic motives
outlined above.

[[This interpretation is **purely speculative**]{.mark},]{.underline}
however, [[and is]{.underline}]{.mark} certainly [n[ot confirmed by
any]{.mark} **[authoritative]{.mark}** [Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline}
statements or **[[documents.]{.underline}]{.mark}** In fact, China's
actions and statements can be most logically explained by the above
interactive dynamic, which centers first and foremost on the maritime
disputes themselves. Indeed, [when measured against the metric of a
supposed direct challenge to the U.S.]{.underline} position in Asia,
[[Beijing's actions seem cautious]{.mark}, even timid]{.underline}.
[[It]{.underline}]{.mark} generally **[[avoids the use of warships to
assert its claims]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [has given assurances that it
does not intend to militarize the Spratly Islands, and has certainly not
attempted to seize land features held by other claimants]{.underline} to
assure its control of the area. Moreover, Beijing continues to insist
that it is dedicated to a peaceful, negotiated solution of the disputes
and supports the peaceful objectives of the 2002 declaration. In
general, it is attempting to increase its influence in both seas without
increasing the chance of armed conflict with the United States.

This could all change, of course, as China's power in the area
increases, and those in and out of the Trump camp who call for a
zero-sum confrontation with Beijing over the maritime disputes assert
that it certainly will, because China's caution thus far conceals its
"real" expansionist and aggressive motives. Again, this is pure
speculation, but of a dangerous sort, since if accepted as a basis for
U.S. policy it would basically lock in a zero-sum interpretation of
every assertive Chinese action, thereby justifying an equally zero-sum
U.S. move in response. And of course, such actions would indeed cause
Beijing to eventually adopt precisely the threatening motives that some
observers insist (incorrectly) are already present.

Unfortunately, this type of overt and adversarial strategic competition
is given significant impetus by the writings of the international media;
the public interpretations of hardline pundits and "experts" in the
United States, China, and other countries; and even some government
officials on all sides. These sources already to a great extent seem to
interpret every U.S. and Chinese statement and action of possible
relevance to the disputed maritime areas as part of a titanic Sino-U.S.
struggle for strategic dominance in Asia, thus pushing the two countries
toward confrontation.

[Beyond basing itself on a **purely speculative**]{.underline} and
dangerous **[set of assumptions about Chinese motives]{.underline}**, [a
[zero-sum, confrontational argument]{.mark}]{.underline} calling for a
doubling down of U.S. capabilities in the Western Pacific also [[employs
another **highly dubious**]{.underline}]{.mark} (at best) [[set of
assumptions]{.mark} [regarding]{.mark} American and [Chinese defense
spending]{.mark}]{.underline} relevant to Asia. Barring an unlikely
near-total collapse of the Chinese economy and/or a major surge in the
overall U.S. GDP, [Washington will not possess the capacity to greatly
exceed the kind of military and economic capabilities that China will be
able to bring to bear]{.underline} in its nearby maritime areas over the
coming years. In fact, projections by [[scholars]{.mark}]{.underline} at
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and other reputable
sources [[predict a much more likely movement toward
**parity**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[between U.S. and Chinese
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} in that region, in other words, a de
facto strategic equilibrium.

#### [Respect]{.underline} is the key variable -- US accommodation is vital to preventing a violent transition 

**Biba, 17** - Institute for Political Science, Goethe University
Frankfurt (Sebastian, "It's status, stupid: explaining the underlying
core problem in US--China Relations" Global Affairs, 2017
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23340460.2016.1276077>

[Behind such behaviour]{.underline}, however, [is]{.underline} a much
more profound mechanism, namely, [[a gradually intensifying status
rivalry between the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and China]{.underline}]{.mark}. Status
refers to an actor's specific rank within a social hierarchy. Status is
of intrinsic value for a state because, generally speaking, the higher
its rank, the more privileges a state can enjoy. As a result, states
tend to seek a high status, just as they require this status to be
recognized by others. However, not every state can have a high status,
because then none does (Larson, Paul, & Wohlforth, 2014, pp. 7--9).
Transferred onto the current US-- China relationship, the situation,
roughly speaking, is as follows: The US status, both globally and in the
Asia-Pacific, remains relatively higher than China's. Also, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates **[wants to defend and bolster
this status]{.underline}**. Meanwhile, China seeks a higher status
increasingly on par with the United States in many issue-areas and wants
the United States to respect this claim. The problem with this status
competition between the United States and China is twofold, though:
First, it underlies, and in fact nourishes, many other grave concerns
prevalent in US--China relations. Second, [if not mitigated, it [has
**huge potential** to end up in **serious
conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The long shadow of power transition

While status is an ideational concept and highly subjective, some key
attributes that serve as the basis for status are material, since some
of the same resources that guarantee power also relate to status (Larson
et al., 2014, pp. 8, 13). Currently, the United States still retains its
role as the world's number-one power, both economically and militarily.
In 2016, the US nominal GDP still accounted for 24.7% of the world
economy (Statistics Times, 2016), while its military expenditure
amounted to a massive 36% of global spending (SIPRI, 2016, p. 2). What
is more, the United States is unwilling to voluntarily leave its top
position to anybody else. Tellingly, Ashley Tellis writes that
"\[p\]reserving American preeminence and by extension the current global
system itself, accordingly, remains the central task for U.S.
policymakers today" (Tellis, 2013, p. 110). At the same time, China has
already made enormous progress since the beginning of its reform and
opening period in 1978 and within less than four decades has catapulted
itself into the second-biggest economy in the world (standing at 15.1%
of global GDP at nominal) (Statistics Times, 2016) and trails only the
United States in terms of military expenditure (13% of global spending)
(SIPRI, 2016, p. 2). Significantly, when measured in real
purchasing-power terms, China overtook the United States as the world's
leading economy in late 2014 (Arends, 2014).

**[[In the past, when incumbent great powers]{.underline}]{.mark}** like
the United States [[were confronted]{.underline}
[with]{.underline}]{.mark} [other [rapidly emerging great powers like
China, this has often]{.mark}]{.underline} -- albeit not always --
**[[led to terrible wars]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [as the newcomers could
not]{.underline}, or did not intend to, [be integrated into the existing
international order.]{.underline} Power transition theory (see Organski
& Kugler, 1981) has made it its business to explain the occurrence, or
absence, of major war between a dominant great power and one of its
rising challengers. In doing so, the theory walks on two legs. First is
the power dimension, which likewise functions as the theory's necessary
condition. The power dimension looks at whether the rising state has
reached parity with (80% is seen as sufficient) or even overtaken the
dominant state in terms of national power. While it can be somewhat
tiresome to calculate one's way through the various ways to measure
national power and predict when exactly the stage of parity, or
overtaking, is reached, [China is without doubt currently the most
powerful and most serious challenger of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates.

The more interesting aspect about power transition theory, however, is
its second leg, that is, its sufficient condition determining the
war-proneness of a transition. This second dimension of the theory is
interested in the degree of (dis)satisfaction of the rising challenger
primarily with its status in the international order as well as with the
benefits to be derived for itself from this order. Simply put, **[[if
the challenger is satisfied with its status in the existing
order]{.underline}]{.mark}**, that is, the status quo, [**[war will be
avoided]{.underline}**; **[however, if the challenger is dissatisfied,
the revisionist challenger will seek to topple the existing order and
war will be the outcome]{.underline}**]{.mark}. So, **[[the critical
question is how (dis)- satisfied is China]{.underline}]{.mark}** with
its current status in the international system, [which is largely shaped
by the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.

China's status seeking

To begin with, **[the Chinese are a highly status-conscious
nation]{.underline}**. In fact, "[Chinese officials]{.underline} and
analysts alike have, since the mid-1990s[, evoked 'international status'
as if it were the **most desirable value**, the one that
leads]{.underline} [to]{.underline} power, security, and
**[respect]{.underline}**" (Deng, 2008, p. 8). This has primarily to do
with the fact that China used to be, or at least perceived itself to be,
what is nowadays called a great power, or even a superpower, throughout
most of its long history. Not only did the Chinese regard their "Middle
Kingdom" as the centre of the civilized world, whereas all others were
seen as "barbarians" to various degrees. Especially during the Han, Tang
and late Ming/early Qing dynasties, the Chinese also claim to have
wielded substantial global influence, as China then was a "highly
advanced, culturally sophisticated, technologically developed society
that contributed significantly to the global economy and \[therefore\]
was internationally revered and respected" (Medeiros, 2009, p. 8).

The period of decline from the First Opium War in 1839 to the foundation
of the People's Republic of China in 1949, during which China became
semi-colonized and which the Chinese refer to as the "century of
humiliation" at the hands of Western and Japanese intervention and
imperialism, is widely considered in China as a "historical mistake" to
be corrected (Yan, 2001, p. 33). [As Yan]{.underline} Xuetong has [put
it:]{.underline}

[\[[T\]he Chinese regard their rise as regaining China's lost
international status rather than as obtaining something
new]{.underline}.]{.mark} [[This psychological feeling results in the
Chinese being continuously dissatisfied \[...\] **until China resumes
its superpower status**]{.underline}]{.mark}. (Yan, 2001, p. 34)

On its path to (re)gain greater international status, China has already
made noticeable headway and achieved some remarkable successes. In
particular, China became a veto-wielding permanent UN Security Council
member in 1971, thus taking an important first step out of international
isolation in the aftermath of China's Great Cultural Revolution of the
late 1960s. After subsequent membership in the World Bank (WB) and
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1980, another milestone was China's
entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, after 15 years of
protracted negotiations. Moreover, while not in the club of the G7/G8,
China surely has become a very prominent player in the G20 after this
grouping gained traction in the aftermath of the global financial crisis
of 2007/2008. As a result, China is now a member of (almost) all key
international, including many regional, organizations and an actor
firmly established in the global governance system. No issue of global
concern, from nuclear proliferation to climate change, can any longer be
successfully tackled without China's active and positive participation.
Besides, China's economic success has long promoted discussions about a
new Chinese development model ("Beijing Consensus") possibly
outstripping the predominant US variant ("Washington Consensus"). The
establishment of hundreds of Confucius Institutes since 2004 has spread
enhanced knowledge about Chinese culture around the entire globe.
Finally, the Chinese were able to fulfil a dream when hosting the 2008
Summer Olympics in Beijing.

Nonetheless, **[[Beijing]{.mark} remains dissatisfied, and increasingly
so]{.underline}**. While China has not yet shown the intention of
toppling the existing international order but has rather sought to
integrate itself with it, at least to a certain degree (see Li, 2011),
[it still [perceives this order to be]{.mark} largely [dominated by
the]{.mark}]{.underline} Wes[t]{.underline} (read: by the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates)
[[and its own seeking for a higher status **disrespected** by
Washington.]{.underline}]{.mark} In the Chinese official discourse, this
becomes obvious, for example, in that China keeps calling for the
"democratization of international relations", meaning that non-Western
powers, above all China, should be given a bigger say and thus a higher
status in the existing global order. While the democratization of
international relations is a long-standing Chinese claim, it has not
lost any of its fervour. In June 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping
called for "jointly promot\[ing\] more balanced international relations
\[and\] advanc\[ing\] reform in global governance in keeping with new
changes in the relative strengths of international forces" (Xinhua,
2014).

### 2nc \-\-- No Impact to Revisionism

#### No impact to Chinese revisionism -- it will err towards negotiation, not force

China's acknowledgement of the external meaning of territorial integrity
is a contested topic. [The cynical view holds that a predominant China
will try to expand]{.underline} and redraw [political borders because
rising states are revisionist and territorial expansion is par for the
course. Such behavior would clearly undermine the territorial integrity
norm]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} I contend that [[although China
will]{.mark} increasingly [insist on a hegemonic relationship with its
neighbors]{.mark}, [it will do so with an eye on
preserving]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[territorial
integrity]{.underline}]{.mark}** of states. [It might press its current
territorial claims, but [it]{.mark} [would not strip states of their
sovereignty]{.mark} [and transform them into Chinese
possessions]{.mark}.]{.underline}

My position is built on two related arguments. First, [[China's
territorial disputes are not based on claims over other sovereign
states]{.underline},]{.mark} in total, nor are the disputes over key
sections of their landmass. There are important disputes to be sure,
such as with India, but these do not lay claim to vital sections of the
Indian state. More importantly, **[[the trend has been toward
reconciliation]{.mark} [rather than escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**.66
Indeed, [[China has shown a proclivity toward negotiation, especially
**when it is strong**]{.underline}]{.mark}. One might challenge my
argument by pointing to Taiwan and arguing that China's territorial
claim threatens the very existence of a sovereign state. But in this
case China actually invokes territorial integrity and treats Taiwan as
an internal matter. Since it has never recognized the sovereignty of
Taiwan, its claim is framed as a matter of sovereignty---an intrastate
rather than an interstate issue. Overall, the real flashpoints in
Chinese territorial disputes are maritime in nature, pitting it against
its neighbors over control of sea-lanes and various uninhabited islands
like the Spratlys or the Senkakus/Diaoyus. These contests are long
running, their rightful ownership is debated, and increased
assertiveness over them is unlikely to challenge the territorial
integrity norm.

#### Chinese revisionism won't undermine territorial sovereignty

**Griffiths, 16 -** Senior Lecturer in the Department of Government and
International Relations at the University of Sydney (Ryan D. Griffiths
(2016) States, Nations, and Territorial Stability: Why Chinese Hegemony
Would Be Better for International Order, Security Studies, 25:3,

The rise of China has generated a veritable cottage industry of articles
and books, and portents and predictions. Will China be content with
current international order, or, like many past rising states, aim to
revise it? My analysis is guided by the Sandholtz and Stiles cycle
model.58 International rule structures are built on power and the appeal
to precedent and normative tradition. In imagining a future where China
is hegemonic I have sidestepped questions about what disputes may occur
along the way, but I can speculate on how a preeminent
[[China]{.mark}]{.underline} would influence the normative order. I
argue that it [will aim to modify the international order
but,]{.underline} importantly[, it [will not attempt to redraw
borders.]{.mark} It will not be revisionist in a territorial
sense.]{.underline} I arrive at this conclusion by examining its current
preferences with respect to self-determination and territorial
integrity, and I contend that these preferences should endure in a time
of Chinese hegemony.

With respect to self-determination, Chinese policy has shown a more
limited support for minority nations. China recognizes secession when it
is consensual, but when the national government in a secessionist crisis
denies the aspiring group, China argues that sovereignty should be
respected and that the outcome of the struggle should be resolved
internally, without interference from the international community.59
Following Kosovo's declaration of independence, Liu Jianchao, the
spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, commented:

China always believes that a plan acceptable to both Serbia and Kosovo
through negotiations is the best way to resolve this issue. The
unilateral move taken by Kosovo will lead to a series of consequences.
China is deeply worried about its severe and negative impact on peace
and stability of the Balkan region and the goal of establishing a
multi-ethnic society in Kosovo. China calls upon Serbia and Kosovo to
continue negotiations for a proper resolution within the framework of
the international law and work together to safeguard peace and stability
of the Balkan region.60

[China criticized the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [for
recognizing Kosovo and pointed out the danger of precedent
setting.]{.underline} Furthermore, China took a similar position on the
recent secession of South Sudan; recognition required a formally
consensual divorce from greater Sudan.

[[China's more austere interpretation of self-determination is
motivated]{.mark}, in part, [by its domestic concerns over
fragmentation]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Complete acceptance of
self-determination presents a problem for multinational states. China
recognizes the rights of stateless nations in the limited sense that
they should have greater autonomy. And since 1958 China has recognized
five autonomous regions: Ningxia, Tibet, Guangxi, Xinjiang, and Inner
Mongolia. The state, however, draws a line with respect to full
independence. Despite the periodic conflicts in Tibet and Xinjiang and
the international criticism China has received in its handling of those
affairs, and despite the potential war that could arise over the Taiwan
question, China adamantly defines these issues as internal problems, and
it repeatedly invokes the norm of territorial integrity when doing so.

[[For China there are precedent-setting concerns when recognizing
breakaway regions]{.mark} in the absence of government
consent]{.underline}, and these concerns are apparent in both the
political and popular rhetoric regarding domestic and foreign
secessionist movements. One of the arguments for denying Taiwanese
independence is to prevent domino effects, since independence there
would embolden "the determination of Tibetan, Uighur, and Mongolian
separatists."61 According to Robert Art, "allowing Taiwan to become
independent would set a disastrous precedent."62 In a 2006 speech,
Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Jia Qinglin stated, "we will never
tolerate Taiwan Independence. We will unswervingly oppose and curb
secessionist forces and their activities."63 These domestic concerns are
visible in public opinion. A recent article in the China Post stated
that "Southern Sudan's nearly certain secession from the Arab-dominated
north is likely to set a dangerous precedent in an Arab world looking
increasingly fractured along sectarian and ethnic lines."64

Overall, [[in a time of Chinese hegemony the recognition of new states
would be pinned to state consent]{.mark} and therefore less
frequent.]{.underline} China currently interprets the norm in a more
constrained manner, and there is little indication that the government
has internalized the norm in any meaningful way. In addition, it has
frequently disagreed with the United States, and other Western powers,
over cases like Kosovo. The norm of self-determination should endure
under a preeminent China, but it would be more constrained.

[Despite conventional wisdom that the AIIB represents a challenge to the
liberal international order]{.underline} and Chinese ambitions to
establish a Sinocentric international order, the AIIB is [an example of
**contested multilateralism**]{.underline}. Specifically, it is a
[strategy of]{.underline} [competitive regime creation]{.underline} to
[better reflect the interests of China]{.underline} [**in the
multilateral development sector** without challenging the]{.underline}
**[constitutional structure and the fundamental institutions of the
liberal international order]{.underline}**. In fact, the AIIB has been
[working **collaboratively with parallel institutions**]{.underline}
within the regime complex such as [the World Bank, the IMF,
the]{.underline} European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
([EBRD]{.underline}), and the ADB. In assessing whether the AIIB
signifies deconcentration and delegitimation of the U.S.-led liberal
order, it is too early to tell whether the AIIB will evolve into a
multilateral development bank that serves as an instrument to export a
Chinese model of economic statecraft such as state capitalism. Moreover,
this paper examines only the AIIB as an example of Chinese contestation
of the liberal international order and future research can test the
contestation-challenge distinction of revisionist state behavior with
other case studies in different issue-areas to corroborate the argument
laid out in this paper. Moreover, the task remains on sophisticated ways
to distinguish contestations from challenges in the security domain.

Certainly, the developmental model, emphasizing export promotion with a
high degree of state intervention, is touted as an alternative pathway
to achieve economic growth, especially after the experiences of the 1997
Asian financial crisis and the 2008 global financial crisis. However,
[it is hard to disregard the possibility of China using these
infrastructure projects as ways to promote Chinese
interest]{.underline}s, by exporting excess capacity in domestic
industries while paving the way for increased connectivity along the
lines of land and sea communications. After all, [even if China had the
intention to construct a regional sphere of influence and an exclusive
China-led international order, the success of such endeavor would rely
on **China's ability to continue its material rise** and to buy
voluntary compliance of secondary power]{.underline}s, earning
legitimacy of a renewed Chinese leadership in the region by presenting
an alternative order[. An early assessment of Chinese efforts at
order-building in the multilateral development domain,]{.underline}
reveals that [secondary powers are]{.underline}, **[gradually, finding
the shortcomings of China-led initiatives]{.underline}**, ranging from
the lack of transparency to the incurrence of exorbitant national debts.
At the same time, the [introduction of]{.underline} the '[Build Back
Better World]{.underline} (B3W)' partnership, by the Biden
administration, [may restore U.S. leadership in the global
infrastructure development]{.underline} sector with emphasis on liberal
values such as transparency, good governance, and environmental
safeguards (The White House, 2021).

If [China is **contesting, not challenging**]{.underline} [the liberal
international order]{.underline}, the countermeasures of the United
States, as the guardian of the liberal international order, become
equally dependent upon the question of whether China will transform into
a 'revolutionary' revisionist power from today's 'reformist' revisionist
power. [A strategy of '**hard' containment** and the use of **coercive
measures to**]{.underline} [suppress Chinese influence]{.underline} in
the region **[will further aggravate Chinese dissatisfaction towards the
liberal international order.]{.underline}** This will [motivate China
to]{.underline} actively [**seek counter-hegemonic military coalitions**
with strategic partners, **such as Russia**]{.underline}, [to challenge
the United States at all levels.]{.underline} Therefore, it is
[important for the United States to **accommodate China's legitimate
demands**]{.underline} within established institutions that reflect the
changes in the distribution of capabilities.

In the abstract, such claims are alarming---in context, and in balance,
rather humdrum. In fact, [the **evidence** of a]{.underline}ny [[Chinese
intention to]{.underline}]{.mark} destroy, or even merely
**[[undermine]{.underline}]{.mark}** and exploit, [[the]{.mark} current
[order is **slight**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [China **is**]{.underline}
certainly [using its]{.underline} growing [military power to **defend**
its **claims in the SCS**]{.underline} and even---on occasion--- to
coerce its neighbors. [It uses **protectionist**]{.underline} economic
**[policies]{.underline}** to boost the prospects of Chinese companies
and reduce competition. [It employs **economic statecraft**]{.underline}
to serve its interests abroad. And it certainly is opposed to America's
policy of global democracy promotion. [However, **none** of these
positions **fundamentally challenge the existing order**, **none** of
them **radically depart** from America's **own actions** when it was a
**rising power**]{.underline} in the nineteenth century, [and [none of
them]{.mark} **obviously [surpass]{.mark}** [America's **own**
]{.mark}**contemporary [record]{.mark}** of **order
subversion**]{.underline}. When [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates was a rising power, it [[took **half
of Mexico**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and]{.mark} **considered taking the
rest**,]{.underline} [it [**colonized**]{.mark} the **Philippines** and
**Hawaii**]{.underline}, [and it **unilaterally seized** the **maritime
choke points of the Caribbean**]{.underline} (Puerto Rico and Cuba).21
[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [used
**tariffs**]{.underline}---which by 1857 averaged 20 percent22 and by
the end of the nineteenth century were "the highest import duties in the
industrial world"23---[to **protect its industries**]{.underline}. [It
**stole intellectual property**]{.underline},24 [and]{.underline} it
[**ideologically challenged** the governments of the "Old
World."]{.underline} Today, despite no longer being a rising power, [the
U]{.underline}nited [States has launched]{.underline} two **[disastrous
invasions]{.underline}**, **[tortured prisoners]{.underline}**, [and
dispatches **drone strikes at a whim** with **little international legal
authority**]{.underline}.25 The point is not that two wrongs make a
right; it is that [international order is **much more resilient** than
**critics seem to realize**]{.underline},26 [and it is **utopian** to
expect any **rising Great Power** to act in a way that **uniformly
satisfies** one's **moral scruples**,]{.underline} evolving, in
Friedberg's words, "into a mellow, satisfied, 'responsible' status quo
power."27 Friedberg or Harris might object that America's rise took
place in the context of a different order. This is perfectly true, but
the more important point is that the long nineteenth century
(1815--1914)---the era of America's rise---was the first iteration of
the New Peace.28 The implication is that [relative peace **can** and
**has** **coexist**ed with **limited wars**, **property** and
**territorial thefts**, acts of **coercion**, and **aggressive
assertions of status.** This does not mean any of these are
**desirable**]{.underline}--- they are [not---but it shows that they
**need not be fatal to the system**]{.underline}. [Insofar as there
**is** a lesson from that **first period** of **relative peace**, it is
that **Great Power confrontation** is the **one thing that is
fatal**]{.underline}. [Accepting this does not mean **capitulating** in
**every instance**, as implied by some]{.underline},29 [but it **does**
mean **rediscovering** the rules of **Great Power
competition**]{.underline}30 alongside the art of strategy.31 Focusing
only on areas that China's rise violates the scruples of the established
powers, moreover, downplays the extent to which [China,
**has**]{.underline}, in fact, [**conformed** to the **existing
order.**]{.underline} As a RAND Corporation report published in 2018
concludes, China has been a supporter---albeit a conditional one---of
the international order: "Since [[China undertook]{.mark} a **policy of
[international engagement]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the 1980s ... the
level and quality of its participation in the order rivals that of most
other states."32 The way in which **[Xi]{.underline}** Jinping,
following his 2017 Davos speech in defense of globalization, [has been
heralded as the **most prominent champion of international order** and
**defender of globalization**]{.underline} underscores the fact that
[there are **different elements** of this order, and that China supports
**many**, if not **most, of them**]{.underline}. [Even in places where
China is **supposedly "altering"** the current order, Beijing tends to
simultaneously **affirm that order**]{.underline}. [[China's]{.mark}
[A]{.mark}sian [I]{.mark}nfrastructure [I]{.mark}nvestment
[B]{.mark}ank]{.underline}, for instance, actually **[[mirrors existing
structures]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and China has intentionally copied
elements and "best practices" of the World Bank and Asian Development
Bank. [China is **playing the same game**, even if it is **seeking a
bigger role within it**]{.underline}.33

[The]{.underline} **[main [findings]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}[of

**[de-escalation]{.underline}** (19[[**95** until]{.underline}]{.mark}
between 2007 and 20**[[09]{.underline}]{.mark}**), [[China had the
**most**]{.mark} advanced **[military power]{.mark}** compared to other
SCS claimants. [However,]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[instead of]{.mark}
using [force]{.mark}**, China]{.underline} [**[extended]{.mark} its
[coop]{.mark}**erative behaviour]{.underline} [which was successful
in]{.underline} **[[de-escalating]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [**[SCS

stabilising the region**]{.underline} [by participating in several
multilateral **agreements**]{.underline}: the 2002 DoC, the ASEAN TAC in
2003, and the JMSU in 2005. [This fact is at **odds** with the offensive
realism assumption that suggests China will pursue hegemonic ambition to
resolve its dispute]{.underline} with other claimants.1

and the Challenge of Rising Powers, *Cambridge University Press*, pp.
197-200)

[The foreign policy preferences of China's elite vary fairly
widely]{.underline}. Shambaugh and Xiao have identified seven distinct
orientations toward the status quo within Chinese foreign policy
discourse. [[At the integrationist]{.mark} end of the spectrum are [the
Globalists]{.mark}, [who believe]{.mark} that [China]{.mark}
[should]{.mark} [take on]{.mark} additional responsibility for **[global
governance]{.mark}** within the existing framework of
institutions]{.underline} -- in short, China should "act as a
responsible power."56 Chinese Globalists are much like Western "liberal
institutionalists," and are thus generally supportive of the liberal
order. Five other perspectives (which Shambaugh and Xiao identify as
Selective Multilateralists, the Global South school, the Asia Firsters,
the Major Powers School, and the Realists) are less sold on the liberal
order, but at least agree that some degree of participation in its
institutions, norms, and rules is necessary.57

But [there is one group -- the [Nativists --]{.mark} that
[reject]{.mark}s [participation in the l]{.mark}iberal
[i]{.mark}nternational [o]{.mark}rder]{.underline}. The Nativists are
"hyper-nationalist" Marxist ideologues who oppose domestic reforms aimed
at producing openness and market capitalism. In the realm of foreign
policy, they oppose participation in the liberal order because they
"view international multilateral involvement as 'traps' (laid by the
West) to embroil China in costly overseas commitments."58 Nativists have
multiple reasons for rejecting integration, not all of which have to do
with status -- for instance, they worry that participation in the
Western order will destabilize the Communist Party. But [they
are]{.underline} also [deeply concerned about China's status and are
skeptical about the prospects of achieving their ambitions within an
order dominated by Western powers]{.underline}. According to Shambaugh
and Xiao, Nativists "regularly harp on the nationalist theme of the
'century of shame and humiliation' and argue that China is entitled to
global respect (particularly by those powers that previously humiliated
China)."59

Liu Mingfu's sensationally popular [China Dream is a]{.underline}
remarkably open [call for a deep revisionist challenge to the liberal
order]{.underline}. While Liu may not be a Nativist (according to
Shambaugh's classification), his writing is worth considering as a
modern Chinese manifestation of the kind of argument that Friedrich von
Bernhardi popularized in Germany during the years before World War I.
Liu's central proposition is that China should aim to become a
"champion" nation -- the global top dog or leader (as distinct from the
hegemon, which to Liu implies a form of imperialism and military
domination). As the "champion," China would "create a new world order
that prefers peace, development, freedom, and cooperative civilization."
This seems like a clear demand for China to -- at some point -- remake
the international order.

[What is significant is the source of the demand for radical
revisionism]{.underline}, and its implications for China's participation
in the liberal order. [Liu links the need for a new order to the
deficiencies of **American hegemony**]{.underline}, the "worst
expression" of which is "its monopolization of its status as
champion."60 [In other words, the United States will not accede
willingly to China's attainment of a position of equality in
a]{.underline} **["multipolar"]{.underline}** [world]{.underline}. The
book goes on to document and decry American efforts to contain the rise
of China, considers lessons fromthe successfulAmerican defeat of two
other potential "champions" (the Soviet Union and Japan), and makes a
clear argument against integrating too deeply within the liberal order:

However, it cannot be denied that America has a clear upper hand in
terms of control and power with China. China can be promoted to copilot
to help the United States cope with risks, but this will only help
America maintain its position as pilot. America allows opponents to
board its plane, which is ultimately a higher degree of control and
containment.61

Integrating within the liberal order would amount to becoming
Washington's "copilot," which would do nothing more than strengthen the
basis of a status hierarchy that the United States is intent upon
preserving. This is reminiscent of the way that Bernhardi, militant
pan-Asianists, andWeimar nationalists argued against participation in
the pre-WorldWar I and interwar orders. And Liu's book is hardly
peripheral: in 2013, Xi Jinping began invoking the term "China Dream" to
describe his vision for China's future, and has reportedly been deeply
influenced by the book's central argument.62

[[Nativists]{.mark} and other revisionists [may not be ascendant]{.mark}
[in Chinese]{.mark} [fo]{.mark}reign [po]{.mark}licy decisionmaking, but
their foreign policy preferences are not marginal either]{.underline}.
While other schools of thought do not take such strident positions
against participation in the liberal order, some share a sense of
skepticism: Realists for instance, are also concerned that Western
institutions are traps meant to keep China down.63 And Chinese elites
remain worried about Chinese status and link it to the terms of
participation in the liberal order -- they emphasize "equality of
participation" over "governance" and chafe at the idea of complying with
American standards in order to be recognized as a "responsible power."64

[So while Chinese foreign policy is currently run mostly by proponents
of intermediate and at least partially integrationist perspectives,
Nativists and others like Liu constitute a loud and potentially
influential voice for policies that reject the liberal international
order]{.underline} -- much like Pan-Asians or German radical
nationalists spent the 1920s demanding policies of protest and
delegitimation from the more moderate leaders who ran Taisho¯ and Weimar
foreign policy.65 [[It is not difficult to imagine **support for the
Nativist perspective**]{.underline}]{.mark} (not just among the elite
but also in the public) [**growing** along with developments that seem
to **confirm fears** that Chinese **status ambitions** face an
insurmountable, unjust **obstacle** imposed by the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and the liberal order. Indeed, evidence suggests
that Chinese "netizen" nationalists are hyper-aware of status issues and
often mobilize in response to concerns about the way China is treated by
foreign actors and what that treatment says about China's international
standing.66

Status, Domestic Politics, and Chinese Foreign Policy

The question that remains is whether -- in China's authoritarian system
-- pressure from outside the government for radical revisionist policies
could have much influence. **[The government is]{.underline}** (and
likely will be for the foreseeable future) [**committed** to foreign
policy moderation: [but]{.mark} what [if
developments]{.mark}]{.underline} appearing to [[confirm]{.mark} that
**[China faces a status "glass ceiling"]{.mark}** **[increase support
for the Nativist position]{.mark}** and lead to widespread demands for
policies aimed at rejecting the liberal order?]{.underline} Could these
forces impact Chinese policy in the same way that they impacted German
and Japanese policy? It is hard to know for sure, but [there is good
reason to think that the government is susceptible to influence from
external pressure]{.underline} and that it may only become more so in
the future.

While some scholars maintain that Chinese policymakers mostly
effectively ignore public opinion, or that public opinion prompts
short-term shifts in official rhetoric or policy but does not influence
grand strategic direction, many others agree that "bottom-up" forces
play a significant role in Chinese foreign policy.67 Unofficial
attitudes and preferences cannot influence policy through the mechanisms
of electoral political competition, but this does not mean they are
irrelevant. First, policy has to be at least somewhat responsive to the
diversity of elite preferences -- just as Bethmann Hollweg was
constrained by the attitudes of the Kaiser, Tirpitz, and the
Pan-Germans, Chinese leaders may be constrained by the preferences of
Nativists and some status-sensitive and integration skeptical Realists
in the military and the Party.68 Second, mass opinion can threaten
China's elite through the dynamics of widespread popular protest.
According to Weiss, mass protests may menace ruling elites by creating
demonstration effects, tipping points, and information cascades;
facilitating future mobilization against the regime; and fostering or
exacerbating divisions within the leadership.69 And while strong
authoritarian states like China can prevent and manage anti-regime
protests, there are costs and risks associated with doing so, especially
when public opinion is aimed at forcing the regime to adopt a more
aggressive foreign policy posture.70 This means that the masses can be a
potent weapon for anyone interested in forcing the government into
adopting a more belligerent foreign policy; [in turn, this means that
any factor that makes it **easier to mobilize anti-Western
opinion**]{.underline} ([such as apparent evidence that the United
States is unwilling to accommodate a Chinese claim to equal
rights]{.underline}) [may **provide opportunities for Chinese proponents
of challenging the liberal order**]{.underline}.

The more genteel [Biden crowd]{.underline} [is]{.underline}
[divided]{.underline} [into three]{.underline} [camps]{.underline}. The
old globalist/nationalist labels don't quite fit because they all agree
on multilateral engagement (globalist) and they haven't lifted Trump's
tariffs (nationalist). But there are big differences among them.

[In one corner are]{.underline} the **[trade
expansionists]{.underline}** [who want to]{.underline} [**tie**
**Asian** **nations** **closer to the U.S.**]{.underline} with trade
deals. [They]{.underline} [include]{.underline} White House Asia
coordinator Kurt [Campbell]{.underline}, Commerce Secretary Gina
[Raimondo]{.underline}, Treasury Secretary Janet
**[Yellen]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** Secretary of State Antony
**[Blinken]{.underline}**.

Then there's the more [labor-friendly faction]{.underline},
[whose]{.underline} [overriding goal is]{.underline} [to make sure trade
deals]{.underline} [don't hurt]{.underline} [workers]{.underline}
already [battered by China trade]{.underline} and are more willing to
use tariffs and quotas to protect them. They include U.S. Trade
Representative Katherine [Tai]{.underline} [and]{.underline} some at the
[White House]{.underline} Council of [Economic]{.underline}
[Advisers]{.underline}.

[The third camp looks at trade through]{.underline} [a political

**[could]{.underline}** **[screw up other administration

summit, which begins Sunday in Germany, Biden plans to relaunch the
effort --- under a new name --- and put forth some initial projects to
show how the plan will work.

\"He will be launching a partnership for global infrastructure, physical
health and digital infrastructure that we think can provide an
alternative to what the Chinese are offering --- to the tune of tens and
ultimately hundreds of billions of dollars when you add in what our G-7
partners are going to do as well,\" said Jake Sullivan, Biden\'s
national security adviser, at a conference in Washington last week.

\"We intend for this to be one of the hallmarks of the Biden
administration foreign policy over the remainder of his tenure,\"
Sullivan said.

**[This isn\'t the first time]{.underline}** [the U.S.

[Eight months into]{.underline} [Biden's]{.underline} presidential
[tenure]{.underline}, the White House has nominated individuals to
[just [55 of the
189](https://afsa.org/list-ambassadorial-appointments)]{.underline} available
[ambassador]{.underline} [positions]{.underline}, **[representing less
than 30 percent of the total offices.]{.underline}** Of the 134
positions currently without a Biden administration nominee, **[97 are
vacant]{.underline}**, [while three belong to]{.underline} [Obama-era
nominees]{.underline}. [The remainder are filled with]{.underline}
[selections from the Trump administration]{.underline}. US allies have
repeatedly
expressed [frustration](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/06/24/america-says-its-back-but-where-are-its-ambassadors) with
the slow US ambassadorial appointment process, with the average time to
confirmation [approximately one
year](https://diplomaticacademy.us/2021/06/13/ambassador-appointment-delays/).
But the [Biden]{.underline} administration [has been **slower to fill
diplomatic**]{.underline} **[positions]{.underline}** **[than previous
administrations]{.underline}**, and notable vacancies in many regions
have [not gone
unnoticed.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-01/biden-s-slow-walk-on-ambassador-picks-leaves-him-trailing-trump) Currently,
the Biden administration has unfilled ambassadorial positions in Japan,
Singapore, China, South Korea, Vietnam, and the Philippines. No
ambassador has yet been proposed for South Korea.

[These]{.underline} **[missing]{.underline}** and delayed diplomatic
**[appointments]{.underline}** **[affect]{.underline}** the
**[quality]{.underline}** [of **US foreign**]{.underline}
**[relations]{.underline}**. For example, repeated controversies with US
ambassadors in South Korea (including one involving an [unfortunate

exacerbated [tensions](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/korea-watch/costs-and-benefits-new-approach-us-rok-joint-exercises-180576) over
US-South Korean [military
interoperability](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022002720972180) and [undermined
cooperation](https://thediplomat.com/2021/03/what-biden-should-consider-when-picking-the-new-us-ambassador-to-south-korea/) over

improve policy design and ensure effective policy implementation. Vacant
positions or inexperienced diplomats, however, can complicate
communication and hamper the Biden administration's commitment to
addressing nuclear and conventional security challenges from China and
North Korea.

[Allies' **aggravation** with slow appointments has been]{.underline}
**[compounded]{.underline}** **[by]{.underline}** the
[Biden]{.underline} [administration's]{.underline}
**[continuation]{.underline}** [of the controversial trend of nominating
public and political figures for ambassador positions over career
diplomats.]{.underline} Unlike other democracies, many US ambassadorial
appointments are allocated to political donors, business leaders, and
other individuals who are not career diplomats. The proportion of
ambassadors fitting the description is high---approximately [30
percent](https://www.lawfareblog.com/troubling-trends-ambassadorial-appointments-1980-present) since
the 1950s---and growing. More than half of Biden's current nominees are
not career diplomats, including public figures like pilot Chesley
"Sully" Sullenberger, University of Pennsylvania President Amy Gutmann,
and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti.

[While many of these individuals have]{.underline} [had
impressive]{.underline} [careers]{.underline}, **[they are less
qualified for diplomatic offices than their career-diplomat
counterparts]{.underline}**. Since 1980, nominees who are not career
diplomats have been 28 percentage points less likely to speak their
receiving state's principal language if it isn't English, 67 percentage
points less likely to have experience in the region of the receiving
state, and 52 percentage points less likely to have foreign policy
experience, according to a [2019 Duke Law

Eric

Unlike in 2010, this long-term plan will describe China as a strategic
competitor. [NATO is **not looking**]{.underline} [for
conflict]{.underline} [with]{.underline} [Beijing]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} [must be capable of addressing]{.underline}
[concerns]{.underline} in cyberspace, human rights and territorial
claims [in the South China]{.underline} Sea --- including consideration
of NATO undertaking freedom of navigation patrols. The updated document
will also likely emphasize cooperation globally with non-NATO
democracies including Australia, Japan and South Korea.

Finally, the concept will emphasize that applications for expansion will
be welcome, subject to the requirements for entry laid out in the NATO
treaty. Finland and Sweden are at the front of the line, but
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Georgia are still hoping for a path to
membership, and so of course is Ukraine.

All these initiatives are sensible and necessary. It is worth
remembering, however, how wrong our 2010 document was in the case of
Russia. Dwight D. Eisenhower, [NATO's first supreme allied
commander]{.underline}, supposedly [said]{.underline} that "**[the plan
is nothing]{.underline}**, [but]{.underline} **[planning is
everything."]{.underline}** He meant, correctly, that the alliance will
get some things wrong and overlook others. 

[We may be headed **toward a more constructive relationship with
China**]{.underline} **[than expected]{.underline}**. Or there may be
unexpected but significant out-of-area challenges --- perhaps in

**[Politically]{.underline}**, [the **Strat**egic
**Con**cept]{.underline} and the unity it represents **[are very
important]{.underline}**. **[However]{.underline}**,
**[militarily]{.underline}** and operationally, **[it is less
significant]{.underline}**. [The **2010** Strategic Concept had been
**moribund**]{.underline} **[since]{.underline}** [at]{.underline}
[least **2014**]{.underline}, following Russia's annexation of Crimea,
but of course NATO has still been operating effectively since. While a
lot of effort has gone into building consensus for Madrid, in many ways
the hard work starts now.

**[There is a coherence issue.]{.underline}** [The Strategic
Concept]{.underline}, as NATO's strategy, [comes after the **two main
plans**]{.underline} -- [SACEUR's [Concept for the Deterrence and
Defence of the Euro-Atlantic
Area](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_133127.htm)]{.underline} [and
the future [NATO Warfighting Capstone
Concept](https://www.act.nato.int/nwcc) -- **have already matured**.
**There** **was**]{.underline} [tacit **acknowledgement**]{.underline}
at the Madrid summit [that]{.underline} [many **underlying** operational
**plans**]{.underline} [would **have to be revised**]{.underline}.
However, with NATO's strategy transforming, **[mere tweaks to
plans]{.underline}** **[do not seem sufficient]{.underline}**, and their
core assumptions should be revisited. For NATO's Warfighting Capstone
Concept -- how it fights in the future -- it is imperative that analysis
of Russia's military performance in Ukraine now becomes the backbone for
its development.

Moreover, [**despite** the **collective**]{.underline}
**[might]{.underline}** [of NATO,]{.underline} it cannot do everything,
and the commitment at the 2015 Warsaw summit to a **['[360-degree
approach](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_133169.htm)'
to security]{.underline}** -- both thematically and geographically --
**[risks]{.underline}** **[overstretch]{.underline}**. In a hardening
world, the Alliance must take the opportunity to go back to its roots
and seek support from other actors, such as the EU. It is still expected
that a NATO--EU joint declaration will materialise before the end of the
year.

"tanker war" of the Iran-Iraq war, which eventually escalated into a
direct military conflict between the United States and Iran. Iran's

### 2ac/1ar \-\-- AT: China Heg Inevitable

#### Studies exaggerate\-\-- even if China takes the lead it means nothing for hegemony.

Ian **Verrender 03-15**-2022 \[ABC Business Editor, Australian
Broadcasting Corporation, "Why China is unlikely to overtake the United
States to become the biggest economy in the world,"
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-03-15/china-faces-significant-hurdles-to-become-biggest-global-economy/100912398//ZW\]

[For decades, it has been one of the great truisms of global foreign
policy; the \"inexorable rise of China]{.underline}\". [Never a question
of if but only when]{.underline}, [the betting amongst academics,
politicians and diplomats has concentrated on how long it would take for
China to overtake the United States as the world\'s biggest
economy]{.underline}. Its sheer size, both in terms of land mass and
population, made it [seemingly inevitable as the economy
developed]{.underline} and living standards soared in one of history\'s
fastest transitions from a Third World agrarian nation to a highly
urbanised society**[. But the path to becoming the biggest is becoming
increasingly hazardous]{.underline}**. [China is experiencing serious
growing pains]{.underline}. The easy gains have been extracted and [many
pundits are winding back those ambitious straight-line extrapolations of
continuous growth]{.underline}. Even then, there are various ways to
measure size. [Time to scale back the growth prospects]{.underline} [A
new study]{.underline} by Lowy Institute researchers Roland Rajah and
Alyssa Leng [casts doubt upon the speed with which China can achieve the
dubious honour of claiming the crown]{.underline} and [questions whether
it will ever become the most powerful]{.underline}. \"[China would
overtake the United States]{.underline} to become the world\'s largest
economy in nominal US dollar [terms by about 2030]{.underline},\" the
report\'s authors conclude. \"**[But it would never establish a
meaningful lead]{.underline}** \... and [would remain far less
prosperous and productive per person than America]{.underline}, even by
mid-century.\" Most research concludes that China will be able to motor
along with around 5 per cent annual economic growth until 2050. If it
did, it would be the world\'s biggest economy by a country mile, with
the capacity to be its own bloc. It is those kinds of [projections that
have created fear and angst among many Western nations]{.underline},
including Australia, [on how best to deal with a global economic
powerhouse]{.underline} of such magnitude that does not adhere to
democratic norms. [This new study paints a vastly different picture of
the future]{.underline}. Rather than 5 per cent growth, it [forecasts
growth of around 2 to 3 per cent a year]{.underline}, which has
[significant ramifications for the balance of global power and a major
impact on China\'s internal politics]{.underline}. \"[With slower
growth, China\'s progress in catching up to rich country average living
standards and productivity levels would remain significantly incomplete,
even by mid-century]{.underline},\" the study says. \"On the one hand,
the average person in China would be 2 to 3 times richer by 2050
compared to today and 2.5 to 3.5 times more productive. \"Nonetheless[,
China would still be much poorer and less productive than the United
States]{.underline}, based on current expectations of future US growth
at around 1.6 per cent a year on average.\" [By 2050, the authors
calculate the average person in China would be only 40 per cent as rich
as the average American]{.underline} and about half as productive. More
than just teething problems [The early gains were easy]{.underline}.
From an economy largely run by the state, allowing individuals to own
and operate their own businesses sent growth soaring. Global capital
poured in, providing cheap investment and employment. [But those easy
gains no longer are available]{.underline}. And the [ongoing fracturing
in relations between the West and an inward looking
Beijing]{.underline}, accelerated by Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine,
[will likely continue to see a slowing and perhaps withdrawal of foreign
investment]{.underline}. In recent years, it has faced a [series of
crises fuelled by mounting debts]{.underline} which have [seen a sharp
uptick in defaults within private and government owned
businesses]{.underline}, most recently concentrated within the property
sector and companies such as Evergrande. Putting aside poor
productivity, [debt and overinvestment in infrastructure]{.underline},
the Lowy Institute report cites another issue as the [biggest overall
impediment to China\'s future]{.underline}; its ageing population and
the legacy of its draconian past one child policy. \"[China\'s working
age population has been shrinking since the middle of last
decade]{.underline},\" it says. \"The [fertility rate has fallen
rapidly]{.underline} over the past decade to just 1.3 births per woman
in 2020 --- well below the replacement rate of 2.1.\" By 2050, China\'s
working age population will have shrunk by around 220 million, which is
around a fifth of its current level, with those aged over 65 making up
about a quarter of the population. The authors conclude that you can
never completely rule out the prospect China could rule the world, [the
chances of such are nowhere near as likely as most studies would
indicate]{.underline}. \"But it would require an enormous degree of
success with productivity enhancing reforms well beyond China\'s track
record to date,\" they argue. \"[It should not be the baseline
expectation.]{.underline}\"

superpower,"
https://theprint.in/opinion/chinas-can-overtake-us-but-it-still-wont-become-global-superpower/588718///ZW\]

There is an [ongoing discussion that China is emerging as a new
superpower and replacing the US from the global power
structure]{.underline}. [China emerging strongly from the growing global
economic crisis]{.underline} due to the Covid-19 pandemic and Donald
[Trump's ally-alienating policies within NATO for the last four years
have pushed this narrative forward considerably]{.underline}. [There is
no doubt that China has already become the global
powerhouse]{.underline} economically, and is [expected to surpass the US
as the world's biggest economy]{.underline} by 2028. [China is still
behind but on its way to surpassing the US in military
power]{.underline} with increased spending on weapons technology and
developing several secretive weapons. [There is no doubt over China
acquiring economic and military strength superior to the US sooner than
late]{.underline}r, but [the question is]{.underline}, [can the
Communist Party-led China be ever as formidable and complete a
superpower]{.underline} as the US has been for the last eight decades?
[When the Soviet Union competed with the US to claim superpower status
during the Cold War period]{.underline}, [it somewhat matched America's
strength in leading alliances and military power]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, at the height of its power, [the Soviet Union was
never a match for US domination economically or culturally]{.underline}.
Like the Soviet Union in the past, [China now faces several geopolitical
and cultural challenges before it can reach global superpower
status]{.underline} similar to the US. [China can't aspire to get the
same respect and acceptance worldwide,]{.underline} even if its economic
and military power overtakes the US. [A democratic US will always have
ideological, political, and cultural superiority compared to a Communist
China]{.underline}. One-party Communist country [Although China has
developed a hybrid system]{.underline} to grow spectacularly on the
economic front[, it is still a one-party Communist country]{.underline}.
Politically, [it has become further closed and centralised than ever
before]{.underline}. The Chinese Communist Party is celebrating its
100th anniversary this year. In 2011, when it was celebrating its 90th
anniversary, I was fortunate to attend an invite-only meeting of the
Chinese Political Science Association in Shanghai. Many top Chinese
political scientists openly discussed the possibilities of China opening
up to a multi-party electoral system. That sort of discussion is almost
impossible to imagine in Xi Jinping-led China now. [No doubt, China is a
strong state with a powerful party bureaucracy, but its politics is
potentially very fragile.]{.underline} Under a closed system, [it is
almost impossible to predict when that spark will arrive to ignite a
political upheaval]{.underline}. This is a country where the Interpol
chief or a globally famous billionaire can disappear without any
official explanation. Hundreds of Chinese millionaires have been living
abroad to protect their wealth from future uncertainties and to avail
the opportunities of open societies. [China has become
rich]{.underline}, it is spending heavily on its university education,
[but 600,000 Chinese students go abroad for their higher studies every
year]{.underline}. [China's economy might be booming for decades, but 10
million Chinese have traveled to other countries to find
jobs]{.underline} while 51 million people from all over the world have
moved to the US for better work and improved living. Tough neighbourhood
Despite its ongoing political troubles, there is no doubt that [the
American political system is resilient to any attack from destabilising
forces]{.underline}. But [that sort of trust in the system continues to
elude China]{.underline}. Though China has been enjoying political
stability for long, [the Chinese people don't have similar trust and
confidence in their political system as the Americans]{.underline} have
in theirs. This will not help China command the respect of other
countries in its competition to become the global superpower.
[Geopolitics also does not favour China]{.underline} as it has the US.
Unlike the US, [China is surrounded by several powerful and competing
countries]{.underline}. Among them, at least two, [Russia and
India]{.underline}, [see the dream of becoming superpowers]{.underline}.
China has also fought wars against them and continues to have several
border disputes. [China is neither safe nor secure in its neighbourhood
to freely engage in political and military projects]{.underline} in
other parts of the world as the US does. Besides [China]{.underline}'s
location in a tough neighbourhood, it also [lacks trusted, powerful
allies]{.underline}. On the one hand, the democratic US has established
strong political and military cooperation with many regionally powerful
countries like the UK, Germany, Japan, and Australia from the Cold War
days. It continues to keep those allies, while getting new ones like
India. On the other hand, [China's only significant ally in the world is
Russia, but that alliance suffers from many contradictions]{.underline}
and has not passed the test of time. [It will be hard to imagine China
gaining the upper hand militarily, economically, and politically in the
future]{.underline}, vis-à-vis the US and its allies' combined forces.
The US stands firm [The US has been and will continue to be the global
cultural superpower, and there is **minimal possibility of China posing
any serious challeng**e to that status]{.underline}. Not only does its
democracy and freedom provide ideological superiority to the US, its
cultural influence through movies, media, music, and literature also
extends across the world. The US is a country of immigrants, and it
represents and enriches the cultures and ideas of the world. But China
has remained a closed country for long. While English remains the
world's language, it is almost impossible to imagine Mandarin taking up
that place. [China will always be struggling to catch up to the
US]{.underline} and take the lead position in the global power race.
Like the Soviet Union, its superpower status will be limited and
confined to certain aspects of it. [The US has everything to hold its
own long in this competition if it doesn't often engage in
self-sabotaging acts]{.underline} like it has in the last four years.

**Yoon Seok-cheon** 03-13-20**22** \[Finance columnist, Hankyoreh,
"Three reasons why China won't overtake the US anytime soon,"
https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_international/1034592.html//ZW\]

It's in the nature of human beings, and countries, to want to be at an
advantage over others. In that sense, history may be seen as a record of
competitions for dominance. Another heated battle for dominance is
unfolding today. We see signs of it in the conflict between the US and
Russia over Ukraine. An even more [intense competition is taking place
between the US and China]{.underline}. In terms of economic might,
[China has reached a level where it poses a threat to the
US]{.underline}. [Dominance is decided as much by economic power as by
military strength]{.underline}. [It's natural for the US to feel
threatened by China's pursuit]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} some
Westerners' **[claims that China is poised to surpass the US should be
seen as exaggerated]{.underline}**. [China has more weaknesses than
people realize]{.underline}. [Demographic issues]{.underline} China is a
massive country. As of 2020, its population was counted at 1.41 billion.
In terms of population, China is over four times larger than the US,
which has around 330 million people. Gross domestic product (GDP) is
calculated by multiplying productivity by the population. [A higher
population is clearly an advantage for a higher GDP]{.underline}. That
fact serves as the basis for most of the predictions that have the
Chinese economy poised to surpass the US economy in view of past growth
rate trends. But those [predictions are mere conjecture]{.underline},
[which fails to take into account qualitative aspects related to the
population]{.underline}. In China's case, the qualitative aspects of its
population are starting to have a negative impact on growth. In many
countries, the pandemic served as a mechanism lowering the birth rate.
When entire families are forced to remain at home, that translates for
most households into greater fears for the future. As financial
difficulties are factored in, stress levels escalate even further. It's
not the sort of climate that would put anyone in the mood. [China's
disease containment measures have been particularly extreme]{.underline}
in comparison with other countries. People are barred from going outside
at all. [This inevitably leads to greater stress for
households]{.underline}. Under the circumstances, the chances of the low
birth rate rebounding are effectively zero. The decline in China's birth
rate dates back to before the pandemic. The country abolished its
one-child policy in 2016, but that alone is not enough to boost the
birth rate. Simply changing the laws is not going to instantly wipe away
memories of decades of education instructing people that they were only
allowed to have one child, with punishments for those who violated the
rule. The total fertility rate, which represents the average number of
children that a woman of childbearing potential (aged 15 to 49) is
expected to bear over the course of her life, remains down at 1.3. The
situation has only gotten worse during the pandemic. According to the
National Bureau of Statistics of China, around 10.6 million children
were born in China in 2021. That's compared to around 12 million in 2020
--- showing that the various incentive measures haven't been effective.
For 2021, the number of births and deaths was roughly equivalent.
[Without people coming in from outside, China is poised to shortly face
a population decline]{.underline}. A declining population doesn't
necessarily spell doom for GDP growth. You can still achieve growth
through increased productivity. The [problem arises when the population
decline occurs in tandem with an aging population]{.underline}. In this
case, senior citizens leave the labor market faster than young people
arrive to take their place. It's a problem that a lot of countries are
facing, and it's especially noticeable in China. [Unless "Xi Jinping's
China" can solve it, a scenario where China surpasses the US may be
unlikely]{.underline}. [Lack of soft power]{.underline} Even without the
US reining it in, [China is unlikely to surpass the US]{.underline}. The
reason has to do with its lack of soft power. [Soft power can be seen as
the finishing touch on a country's dominance]{.underline} or standing.
You can't assume control of the world unless you can dominate through
cultural products. [At the moment, US cultural products are in a league
of their own]{.underline}, circulating all around the world. Even in the
21st century, the US remains massively influential with its films and
television series. What about [China]{.underline}? Despite its long
history and time-honored traditions, it has [produced nothing to boast
about]{.underline} in terms of cultural products. China may have the
economic might to threaten the US, but [in terms of soft power, it is
still in its infancy]{.underline}. Over the four decades since it
implemented reforms and openness, it has achieved global success with
exactly two of its cultural products: Liu Cixin's science fiction novel
"The Three-Body Problem" and the short-form video service TikTok. Even
those successes can only be viewed as partial. "The Three-Body Problem"
won Liu the Hugo Award in 2015 --- an honor that could be called the
Nobel of science fiction. He was the first Asian to achieve that.
Without question, the book is a work of genius. But its success is still
only within the narrow confines of the science fiction genre. Not only
has it failed to broaden its base, but the follow-ups have been
underwhelming. We see a similar situation with TikTok. Owing to a lack
of Chinese content, it hasn't served as a window for distributing
culture. Among Asian countries, soft power has been growing by the day
in South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. South Korea's popular music, films,
and television series have joined the ranks of the world-class. Japanese
animation remains influential as well. Yet [China]{.underline}, a
country seen as synonymous with Asian civilization, [has yet to develop
soft power]{.underline}. The reason for that is self-evident: [the state
itself clamps down on creativity]{.underline}. "The Three-Body Problem"
was able to gain worldwide acclaim thanks to celebrities who actively
promoted the book in various media. This is unimaginable in China right
now. [Chinese authorities thoroughly regulate speech unrelated to
patriotism or everyday life.]{.underline} When channels of speech are
obstructed, creativity dies out. Though Asian culture is now widely
consumed in the West, Chinese culture's share of the market is minimal
at best. China clearly has a rich and lively culture. The problem is its
government, which isn't very interested in encouraging or enhancing
cultural activity within its borders. The Chinese government believes
information hinders stability. Under such circumstances, the promotion
of Chinese culture abroad becomes a complicated matter. The Chinese
government also partially blocks the influx of foreign cultural products
into China. It's only natural that Chinese culture is enjoying
diminishing opportunities to globalize. Aside from censorship,
indifference is another factor that's further isolating Chinese culture
from the world. China's insistence on doing everything the Chinese way
itself is causing the country's soft power to languish.
[This]{.underline} in turn [has inevitably led to the decline of the
competitiveness of China and its companies]{.underline}. [Debt and
inequality]{.underline} Astronomical debt and severe inequality are
other main factors impeding growth for China. While the latter is a big
problem in and of itself, the bigger problem is that [China is
attempting to solve the issue of inequality through force]{.underline}.
The [country's push for "common prosperity" will ultimately undermine
its growth potential]{.underline}, as it will surely hurt the vitality
of Chinese corporations. Private enterprises in China are rapidly
becoming public under state control. Though the country's authorities
dream of realizing Chinese-style capitalism, such an approach may
[weaken entrepreneurship and temper the competitiveness of Chinese
businesses]{.underline} in the long run. While the approach can
effectively foster growth in fledgling industries, it will negatively
impact industries that call for creativity and a daring spirit. [Though
China is attempting to redesign its economic and financial systems
without destabilizing its society, it's unclear whether this can be done
without any changes in its governing system]{.underline}, the
fundamental source of inequality in China. Chinese President Xi Jinping
must simultaneously accomplish two seemingly contradictory goals, the
very goals that past Chinese leaders strived to realize for centuries:
growth and equality. Unfortunately, the path to these destinations is
long and winding, and inequality is only worsening in China. [Debt is
another serious problem in the country]{.underline}, especially that of
local governments. The real estate market, comprising 30% of China's
GDP, was what mainly powered the Chinese economy. But the debt explosion
triggered by the bankruptcy of the China Evergrande Group may end up
affecting local governments, who up until now made up for budgetary
deficits by selling land to real estate developers. Now, this has become
impossible. The finances of local governments will slowly deteriorate,
and regional disparity will intensify. The conflict between the wealthy
coastal region and the poor western region may come to light and lead to
social unrest. The Chinese government has designated zero COVID,
economic growth of 5%, and debt reduction as its three main policy
objectives. Already, the last goal is falling by the wayside due to
concerns that austerity measures for the purpose of debt reduction and
stabilization will cause economic stagnation. That being the case, will
China be able to achieve its other two goals? China's zero-COVID policy
has been put in jeopardy due to the emergence of the highly
transmissible Omicron variant. Because of China's track record of low
caseloads, only a small number of Chinese people have developed natural
immunity against the COVID-19 virus. The effectiveness of Chinese
vaccines is also questionable. Rigid lockdowns for the sake of zero
COVID transmission are impediments to growth in and of themselves. If
lockdowns fail, China may be subject to the kind of economic chaos that
swept the world early in the pandemic. Countries around the world are
suffering from the consequences of COVID-19 --- China won't be the
exception for long. What's meant to happen is bound to happen. Will
China be able to achieve a 5% economic growth under these circumstances?
[Pax Americana's long run]{.underline} [It was once projected that
Japan]{.underline}, which entered the ranks of wealthy nations before
becoming an aging society, [would outpace the US in terms of its
economy]{.underline}. [This turned out to be a mere pipe
dream]{.underline}. What then of China? [China's population is already
aging when the country has yet to accumulate much wealth]{.underline}.
[Astronomical expenses will be needed t]{.underline}o make sure its
aging population doesn't tip China into social unrest. [The cost may be
too much for China to handle]{.underline}. To make matters worse, Xi
Jinping is pressuring corporations, the backbone of economic growth.
More importantly, [China can no longer boast low-cost labor as its
strength]{.underline}. The country is losing its competitive edge in
labor-intensive industries. But this doesn't mean the country has become
competitive enough in high-tech industries with high added value. [These
factors can all contribute to social instability]{.underline}.
Considering all this, [it's baseless, wishful thinking to imagine China
coming out victorious in its race against the US]{.underline}. The
above-mentioned issues must be resolved for China to gain an upper hand
in its competition with the North American powerhouse. Whether China is
capable of overcoming these challenges under its current governing
system is open to doubt. There are limits to the ruling class's ability
to better itself. The solution has to be structural. But to expect this
of an unchecked power is in itself a contradiction. Then, [it's clear
what the outcome will be of the hegemonic competition between the US and
China]{.underline}. [Pax Americana may continue]{.underline} on longer
than one might think.

this year, Bloomberg Economics predicts. While [Beijing]{.underline} is
applying fiscal, monetary and regulatory [stimulus
measures]{.underline}, the impact is [being blunted by President Xi
Jinping's Covid Zero policy]{.underline}, which requires strict curbs on
activity when virus outbreaks occur. The US, while struggling to cope
with high inflation, is still being propelled by strong hiring and
consumer spending. The Bloomberg Economics call is on the bearish end of
the spectrum, with the median forecast for China's 2022 GDP growth still
over 4%. If they have it right, this year would be the first time that
China's full-year growth pace has lagged behind that of its rival since
1976, when China was emerging from the tumultuous decade of the Cultural
Revolution, World Bank data show. [Since the "reform and opening up"
campaign launched in the late 1970s, China has enjoyed faster expansion
rates]{.underline}, with plenty of scope still remaining for its
per-capita GDP to narrow the gap with the US. Catching Up [China\'s
per-capita GDP remains well below US]{.underline}, showcasing growth
potential President Joe [Biden]{.underline}, who is urging congressional
lawmakers to pass a package of legislation aimed at strengthening US
competitiveness against China, [would be sure to seize on such a
relative growth outcome]{.underline}. [He has framed his economic
agenda]{.underline} in part [around demonstrating]{.underline} whether
[democracies can stand up to Xi's authoritarian model]{.underline}. [The
stakes are even higher for Xi]{.underline}, who is widely expected to
secure a third term as Communist Party chief later this year in a
precedent-breaking move. [A 2% growth rate would be far below the
government's official growth target of about 5.5% this
year]{.underline}. Xi told officials to ensure China's growth outpaces
the US this year, the Wall Street Journal reported last month. [It would
mark the first time the nation significantly undershot the annual
goal]{.underline} since the practice of setting targets was adopted in
the late 1990s. The government didn't publish a target in 2020, when the
pandemic hit. [This year's goal of "around 5.5%," the lowest ever
set]{.underline}, was determined by Chinese leaders before the latest
spate of lockdowns in metropolises including Shanghai, which have
devastated domestic spending. Some economists now estimate China's GDP
contracted this quarter amid April declines in retail sales and
industrial production. [A 2% expansion also would be the weakest for
China since 1976]{.underline}, [undershooting even 2020]{.underline}
when the pandemic pulled GDP growth down to 2.2%. Back in the aftermath
of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, a much-smaller Chinese economy
expanded 3.9% in 1990. Politics may have played some part in the setting
of a target that already looked ambitious before the latest
pandemic-related measures, according to Stephen Jen, who runs hedge fund
and advisory firm Eurizon SLJ Capital. There are likely divisions over
the magnitude of regulatory moves against industries including property
and technology, in his analysis. "This is, we suspect, the main reason
behind the obviously aggressive growth target: it was intentionally
planted by the 'pro-growth' camp in Beijing to limit further
'crackdowns' and restore a better environment for the private sector to
thrive," Jen and colleague Joana Freire wrote in a note earlier this
month. Policy makers indeed have repeatedly rolled out pledges of more
growth-friendly measures. Vice Premier Liu He earlier this week hinted
that Beijing may be ready to let up on the clampdown on technology
firms. But [announcements have fallen short of any]{.underline}
specific, [large-scale fiscal package]{.underline} or decisive
across-the-board monetary easing, leaving economists and investors
unimpressed. "China still has policy options," Citigroup Inc. economists
Xiangrong Yu and Xiaowen Jin wrote in a note this week. "At this
juncture, a timely and decisive rollout of real stimulus measures is
really critical to bring growth back on track." One footnote to the GDP
rivalry: [Biden has already claimed credit for outpacing
China]{.underline}. "For the first time in 20 years, our economy grew
faster than China's," the president said in a statement on GDP data in
January. Measuring the fourth-quarter of last year compared with the
same period of 2020, the US expanded 5.5% against China's 4%. American
growth in the final three months of last year was accentuated by a jump
in inventories. It remains to be seen whether the US can outstrip China
on a calendar-year average basis

### 2ac/1ar \-\-- China Regs Don't Work

#### China's regulations for AI aren't feasible.

Makenzie **Holland** 03-17-20**22** \[News writer covering big tech and
federal regulation, Tech Target, "China's AI regulations face technical
challenge,"
https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/news/252514781/Chinas-AI-regulations-face-technical-challenge//ZW\]

[China is one of the first countries to regulate AI algorithms \-- a
regulation that may prove technically difficult for businesses to adhere
to]{.underline}**.** China\'s AI algorithm regulations took effect March
1, requiring businesses to provide explainable AI algorithms and be
transparent about their purpose, such as for recommending products or
services. The new regulations also prohibit businesses reliant on AI
algorithms from offering different prices to different people based on
personal data collected. [Technical feasibility will be one of the most
challenging aspects facing the new regulations]{.underline}**, said
Russell Wald, director of policy for Stanford University\'s Institute
for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). Explainable AI has
proven to be difficult for businesses to offer up.** **In this Q&A, Wald
talks about the AI regulations\' impact on businesses, as well as how
they\'re unlikely to affect the Chinese government\'s own use of AI when
it comes to surveilling its citizens.** What do you think about China
taking this step? Wald: What I find most interesting is China has done
this first. We can see and watch in real time what happens to some of
these businesses now being regulated for the first time. Questions
remain about the technical feasibility of this. The question is, are we
seeing regulation in theory or regulation in practice? One key part is a
continuing need for human-centered AI. How do you define human-centered
AI? Wald: AI that is inspired by the human brain and comes from what
you\'ve seen in human development. AI that doesn\'t replace humans but
augments human capability. And the third part of that is AI that
doesn\'t harm but rather benefits humanity ... technology fostering
instead of eroding democratic aspects. That\'s the key part. It\'s a
recognition of the rights of everyone to be able to go in and look at
these technologies and have fair access to them and the rights to
challenge their governments when they\'re in use. How will requiring AI
algorithmic accountability and transparency impact businesses? Wald:
[There is the technical issue here of whether that\'s
feasible]{.underline}. [That\'s one layer that has a big question mark
hanging over it]{.underline}. Then there\'s the aspect of following
regulation where you could and being in compliance with that. To that
end, whether or not those companies will be able to do it, I think
they\'ll have to. I don\'t think they have a choice. The larger question
is not whether Chinese businesses are able to comply with this, it is
whether other international companies will now be affected by this. If
you\'re selling into the Chinese market, you are going to have to work
on that. That\'s where a unique tension is going to come through. [What
if China says, \'It is technically feasible\'? Then there will be other
countries that say \'No, it\'s actually not, we\'ve had these
problems]{.underline}.\' Will these regulations apply to the Chinese
government\'s use of AI? Wald: [The government will not
cede,]{.underline} from my view at least, [its surveillance of its
citizens]{.underline}. Because of that, I think it\'ll always have
access to that technology. It\'s too tempting. It even remains tempting
for local law enforcement in the U.S. But here, at least in the United
States, we\'re having a debate about an AI bill of rights. We\'re
debating about facial recognition use by police, by the federal
government at the border. There is this open debate. That debate is not
happening in this case of the \[Chinese\] government\'s use of it. Do
you think there needs to be more debate before moving forward with AI
regulations? Wald: The EU or U.S. system of open debate around this is
ultimately driving us in the right space. Not fast enough, but still a
better pathway forward. What I do have concerns about in [the U.S.
is]{.underline} we are [woefully behind]{.underline}. [You\'re starting
to see an increase in legislation]{.underline}. You\'re starting to see
a Federal Trade Commission that\'s trying to lean a little more forward
on some of this. But I think the best way to have these dialogues and
national debate is through legislation where all the interest groups,
all the advocacy organizations, everyone comes to the table and hashes
it out. Are there aspects of the Chinese legislation you\'ll be paying
attention to, like how they handle consumer complaints about potential
harms caused by AI algorithms? Wald: I mentioned that technical
feasibility part, that\'s really important. I\'m more curious about what
the petition process will be. I\'d like to watch that space more than
anything. Is it significant, is it public, are a lot of people openly
complaining? I would be curious to see the registration of these
complaints. That would be important for when Europe or the U.S. starts
to get into this model. What\'s the mechanism for them to be able to do
this? If we all had a contact at the FTC or the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, they\'d be flooded and overwhelmed and unable to
manage that process appropriately. The logistics of managing that has
huge application towards ultimate effectiveness. Editor\'s note:

#### China led AI strangles innovation\-\--American standards are key.

Arijit **Sengupta** 09-15-**21** \[Founder and CEO of Aible, Fast
Company, "China's new proposed law could strangle the development of
AI," https://www.fastcompany.com/90676516/china-ai-law-problems//ZW\]

[China's]{.underline} internet watchdog, the Cyberspace Administration
of China (CAC), recently issued a draft [proposal of
regulations]{.underline} to manage how technology companies use
algorithms when providing services to consumers. The proposed law
mandates that companies must use algorithms to "actively spread positive
energy." Under the proposal, companies must submit their algorithms to
the government for approval or risk being fined and having their service
terminated. This [is an incredibly bad and even dangerous
idea]{.underline}. [It's what happens when people who don't understand
AI try to regulate AI]{.underline}. [Instead of fostering innovation,
governments are looking at AI through their unique lenses of fear and
trying to reduce the harm they worry about most]{.underline}. Thus,
western regulators focus on fears such as violation of privacy, while
Chinese regulators are perfectly okay with collecting private data on
their citizens but are concerned about AI's ability to influence people
in ways deemed undesirable by the government. [If the Chinese law is
adopted, it will create a lengthy bureaucratic process that will likely
ensure that no small company or startup will survive or even enter the
market]{.underline}. [The moment you allow government regulators to be
the final arbiters of what emerging technologies can and cannot do,
you've strangled innovation]{.underline}. The only people who will
profit under such a law are large companies that can invest in
unproductive bureaucratic activities due to massive cash reserves and
bad actors because they'll ignore regulators and do whatever they want.
Cash-starved startups who wish to follow the law will be most
disadvantaged by this approach. China is not alone in taking
bureaucratic approaches to AI. In April, the European Union released a
draft Artificial Intelligence Act that would ban certain AI practices
outright and mandate that AI applications deemed "high risk" meet strict
data governance and risk management requirements. This includes
requirements on testing, training, and validating algorithms, ensuring
human oversight, and meeting standards of accuracy, robustness, and
cybersecurity. Businesses would need to prove that their AI systems
conform with these requirements before placing them on the European
market. Imposing algorithm requirements or requiring companies to
justify approaches can sound less onerous than the outright banning of
technologies. The reality is that in either case, startups do not have
the resources to participate in such bureaucratic slow processes.
Smaller companies will be forced out of the arena even though they are
most likely to create true innovations in this space. Imagine a world
where startups had to get patents on their technology before building
their software. Only about half of U.S. patents are approved, which is
not terrible, but it takes about two years for approval to come through.
[Algorithms are more difficult to examine than
patents]{.underline}---especially deep learning algorithms which very
few experts understand. Based on the lengthy timelines in the patent
office, [we can surmise that algorithm approval processes are likely to
take longer than two years]{.underline}. [This is simply not fast
enough]{.underline}: [Technology in a rapidly evolving space like AI
would already be outdated by the time it was approved]{.underline}. Any
approach that involves regulators preapproving algorithms would strangle
innovation in this space. There's another reason why such legislation
would be more onerous for small companies. For startups reliant on
venture capital investments, typical funding cycles are 18 months long,
which means that investors expect to see tangible results from the
investment in less than 18 months. Thus, current investment approaches
would not support waiting years to get algorithms approved before
launching a product. While some VCs may adopt a different investment
approach, similar to medical investments for example, many entrepreneurs
would simply turn away from AI and pursue other opportunities. [The U.S.
is in a unique position to get AI guidelines right]{.underline}. [While
China and the European Union outline ever-stricter guidelines banning
certain types of AI, the U.S. has an opportunity to establish ethical
guidelines without inhibiting innovation]{.underline}. The only
appropriate approach to regulating AI is one where we make our societal
goals clear from the start and hold companies liable if they violate
those goals. For example, we don't force every company to undergo
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) inspections before
being able to operate. However, labor safety expectations are enshrined
in law and violators are prosecuted. If companies find alternative
approaches to keeping their employees safe, they are not penalized as
long as the societal goals are achieved. Giving government regulators
the power to limit broad technology categories is not the approach that
built the internet or the smartphone. That's why [the U.S. should tackle
AI regulation by making our societal goals clear and giving
organizations flexibility in achieving such goals]{.underline}.

#### New regulations create steep barriers for tech companies.

https://thediplomat.com/2021/12/will-chinas-regulatory-great-wall-hamper-ai-ambitions///ZW\]

In September the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) announced a
three-year plan to regulate predictive algorithms, and Chinese companies
scrambled to comply with new regulations. News of the plan came on the
heels of two other stringent policies -- the Data Security Law (DSL) and
Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) -- which were passed earlier
this year and came into full effect in November. [China's push for data
security and algorithmic governance should be viewed as a new chapter in
the country's storied attempts to regulate the technology
sector]{.underline}. In all likelihood, [these moves will minimally
affect state security bureaus' data collection capabilities, but will
create steep compliance costs for internet companies that could hamper
the state's long-term development goals]{.underline}. The DSL is
designed to curtail invasive data collection by Chinese tech companies.
Specifically, it restricts the collection of data by Chinese companies
within and outside of China that may "harm the national security or
public interests of the PRC." Given the ambiguous nature of the law,
[many Chinese companies have erred on the side of
over-compliance]{.underline}, rather than risk facing exorbitant
penalties -- which range from \$1,000 to over \$150,000, and may result
in the suspension or revocation of a business' license. The PIPL imposes
even more day-to-day compliance costs on Chinese tech companies that
work with personal data. Under the law, Chinese companies are now
obligated to create cybersecurity teams, conduct training sessions, and
classify data according to the potential for national security threat.
[The sweeping regulatory framework consists of 74 articles, and it
applies to any company that handles individual Chinese citizens'
personal information]{.underline}. Taken collectively, [the DSL and PIPL
should be viewed as a new chapter in Beijing's push to regulate the
Chinese technology sector]{.underline}. [At first glance, the steep
limits they place on data collection stand at odds with Beijing's
long-standing ambition to become the world leader in AI by
2030]{.underline}. [But the laws' long-term effects will hinge on two
hotly debated questions]{.underline} about how China's national tech
champions interact with the state. The first question is [whether the
new regulations will actually apply to China's "national AI
champions]{.underline}," o[r whether the special relationship between
big tech and the state might exempt them]{.underline} from the most
onerous requirements. [On the one hand, the Communist Party under Xi
Jinping seems adamant about curtailing the massive power China's tech
companies have accumulated]{.underline} over the past decade, and is
using these data governance regulations to reassert control. For their
part, [investors]{.underline} do [expect China's internet titans to take
a hit]{.underline}. Immediately after the DSL was passed, the Hang Seng
Tech index measured a 2.5 percent decrease in China's largest internet
and e-commerce stocks, to include those of Tencent and Alibaba,
amounting to a loss equivalent to tens of billions of U.S. dollars. In
the same month, when China's most popular ride sharing app Didi Chuxing
filed for an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, Chinese regulators
yanked it from app stores, citing violations of DSL's data security
regulations. The company has since lost 30 percent of users and seen its
share value decline by more than 40 percent. On the other hand, however,
the Chinese government has historically relied on Chinese internet
giants Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent to aid in intelligence and police
work, by collecting and processing troves of information these companies
collect about Chinese netizens. Through Article 7 of China's National
Intelligence Law, Article 77 of the National Security Law, and Article
28 of the Cybersecurity Law, the government is able to deputize internet
companies to assist with intelligence gathering. The codependent
relationship between Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and Chinese security
services could imply [that China's AI champions are too big to
regulate]{.underline}. But if they are subject to the full force of the
DSL and PIPL, the second question is whether the limitations set out in
these laws will materially limit Chinese tech giants' ability to collect
and process data at scale. Neither the DSL nor PIPL constrains data
collection by China's state security apparatus -- only internet and data
companies. But it's not clear to what extent state security offices rely
on data collected data in-house or outsourced to these firms. [If public
security bureaus have immediate and unfiltered access to the collection
platforms operated by private companies]{.underline}, as has been
claimed about Huawei 5G platforms and Lenovo computers, then [the
government would have little incentive to spare Chinese AI companies
from stringent restrictions on data collection]{.underline}. But,
because of their special relationship with the state, it's possible that
China's internet companies will benefit from data collected and provided
by Chinese security services to continue their AI development. Under the
auspices of China's national security and cybersecurity laws, Chinese
businesses are compelled to work with the state's security apparatus.
Companies that handle data related to "national security" are further
required to allow the Ministry of State Security access to their
companies' servers. Even if Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent face data
collection limitations, they could theoretically continue to rely on
data provided by Chinese security services to fine-tune their AI
products. Although it's not clear how exactly China's large internet
companies may be affected by new regulations on data and algorithms, the
composition of China's private tech industry will be fundamentally
altered. [The DSL and PIPL]{.underline} will make it substantially
harder for existing businesses to continue operating with the same
degree of autonomy they had enjoyed in the past, and may [create steep
barriers for new players]{.underline} hoping to enter China's tech
market.

[Most of the visions for]{.underline} self-modifying and [self-improving
AI have been a bit scary]{.underline} or a bit shallow. [Much discussion
has occurred around the concept of the singularity]{.underline}, first
explained by Vernor Vinge^2^ and now a theme popularized by Ray
Kurzweil,^3^ among others (for example, see www.aleph.
so/Trans/Global/Singularity). Roughly, [the singularity is a point in
history when technology accelerates beyond human capacity to master
it]{.underline}. [With regard to AI, this could mean that computers
learn and communicate with one another faster than they can with humans.
At that point, they might not be willing to slow down or engage
further]{.underline}. In such a case, the machines would reach a kind of
escape velocity, enabling them to leave human culture behind. [I\'m
suggesting that we should actively seek to create the capabilities
underlying such a possibility]{.underline}, because **[the potential
gains are exponentially greater than what traditional puppetry can
produce]{.underline}**. But [this surely entails risks]{.underline}, as
readily suggested in most of the scary movies about rogue AI and robots
gone haywire. [We]{.underline} obviously [have limited insight
into]{.underline} both [the]{.underline} positive and [negative
capabilities of self-improving AI systems]{.underline}. Although [the
road will be somewhat long]{.underline}, we ought to consider ways to
identify and mitigate the risks before they afflict us. Fortunately,
[many people interested in the singularity and future visions of robots
have given these issues serious consideration]{.underline}. We\'ll want
to incorporate their ideas and related technologies into the new
creationism agenda. This will help [prevent predictable
problems]{.underline} and provide additional insurance against the
unforeseen. Although I consider these risks serious, I think [we can
de-emphasize or defer them a bit]{.underline}. [To get out of the
puppetry business will require a major shift in]{.underline} investment,
orientation, and [technology]{.underline}. By focusing mostly on the
required new capacities for model-based learning and improvements in
operational contexts, we put first things first. Like the master puppet
makers of the classic folktales, [AI engineers have built some marvelous
machines]{.underline}. These machines are surely valuable, but our
puppetry won\'t cross the chasm separating us from a world of
artificially intelligent creatures. To get there, we need a singularity
of artificial creationism, where we launch artificial beings that can
adapt, learn, and evolve. [We need to emphasize the development of
continuously self-improving systems that interact with and perform tasks
in the physical world]{.underline}. Creation of those systems will mark
a singularity in the punctuated evolution of artificial intelligence.

Yet, [AI is]{.underline} also [transforming economies and
societies]{.underline}, and [generating new security
challenges]{.underline}. Automation will lead to widespread
unemployment. The final realization of driverless cars, for example,
will put out of work millions of taxi, Uber, and long-haul truck
drivers. Populist movements in the West have been driven by those
disaffected by globalization and technology, and mass unemployment
caused by automation will further grow those ranks and provide new fuel
to grievance politics. Moreover, [some fear that autonomous weapons
systems will become "killer robots]{.underline}" that select and engage
targets [without human input]{.underline}, and could [eventually turn on
their creators, resulting in human extinction]{.underline}. The [other
technologies]{.underline} on this list similarly [balance great
potential upside with great downside risk]{.underline}. 3D printing, for
example, can be used to "make anything anywhere," reducing costs for a
wide range of manufactured goods and encouraging a return of local
manufacturing industries.61 At the same time, [advanced 3D printers can
also be used by revisionist and rogue states to print component parts
for]{.underline} advanced weapons systems or even [WMD programs,
spurring arms races and weapons proliferation]{.underline}.62 Genetic
engineering can wipe out entire classes of disease through improved
medicine, or wipe out entire classes of people through genetically
engineered superbugs. Directed-energy missile defenses may defend
against incoming missile attacks, while also undermining global
strategic stability. Perhaps [the greatest risk to global strategic
stability from new technology]{.underline}, however, [comes from the
risk that revisionist autocracies may win the new tech arms
race]{.underline}. [Throughout history, states that have
dominated]{.underline} the commanding heights of
[tech]{.underline}nological progress [have also dominated international
relations]{.underline}. The United States has been the world's
innovation leader from Edison's light bulb to nuclear weapons and the
Internet. Accordingly, [stability has been maintained in Europe and Asia
for decades because the United States]{.underline} and its democratic
allies possessed a favorable economic and military balance of power in
those key regions. [Many believe]{.underline}, however, [that China may
now have the lead in the new technologies]{.underline} of the
twenty-first century, [including AI, quantum, 5G, hypersonic missiles,
and other]{.underline}s. [If China succeeds]{.underline} in mastering
the technologies of the future before the democratic core, then t[his
could lead to a drastic and rapid shift in the balance of
power]{.underline}, [upsetting global strategic stability]{.underline},
and the call for a democratic-led, rules-based system outlined in these
pages.63 [The United States]{.underline} and its democratic allies [need
to work with other major powers to develop a framework for harnessing
emerging technology in a way that maximizes its]{.underline} upside
[potential]{.underline}, [while mitigating against its downside
risks]{.underline}, and also contributing to the maintenance of global
stability. The existing international order contains a wide range of
agreements for harnessing the technologies of the twentieth century, but
they need to be updated for the twenty-first century. The world needs an
entire new set of arms-control, nonproliferation, export-control, and
other agreements to exploit new technology while mitigating downside
risk. These [agreements should seek to maintain global strategic
stability]{.underline} among the major powers, [and prevent the
proliferation of dangerous weapons systems to hostile and revisionist
states]{.underline}.

#### China can't develop AI\-\-- lack of innovative talent and restrictive legislation.

Chasm,
https://www.imd.org/research-knowledge/articles/the-chinese-AI-innovation-chasm///ZW\]

The Chinese AI advantage [Leading economies in the world understand the
importance of]{.underline} artificial intelligence ([AI]{.underline}) in
generating economic growth. China is no exception. In July 2017, the
Chinese State Council declared that AI was a top priority and created
the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan to catch up
with the West by 2020 and overtake it by 2025. Investment is not only
coming from the government. In April 2018, SenseTime Group Ltd, backed
by Alibaba, became the world's most valuable AI start/up, having raised
\$600 million. By 2030, it is predicted that AI will increase China's
GDP by 26.1%. In addition to massive investment, [China has]{.underline}
other distinct [characteristics that put it at an advantage in the
development of AI]{.underline}. With more than 700 million internet
users, China has a clear advantage in data volume that can be used to
train AI-learning algorithms. Its unique brand of socialist market
economy gives the government substantial control over market forces,
creating a closer cooperation between businesses and the government, and
giving Beijing economic leverage to expand its AI initiatives across
many industries. Additionally, China has relatively few privacy
protection laws, providing the government with extensive access to
consumer data, a key to AI development. [China's innovation talent gap
Despite heavy investment and easy access to data, however, we believe
**China will struggle to realize its AI ambitions**]{.underline}. [The
main obstacle for AI development]{.underline} in China [is]{.underline}
not lack of funding, but [lack of innovative talent]{.underline}. China
is not short on raw technical talent -- quite the opposite. The number
of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) graduates
has been particularly explosive as part of the government's push to
develop a technical workforce. In 2013, 40 percent of Chinese graduates
finished a degree in STEM, more than twice the U.S. average.
Nevertheless, we believe that [AI advancements will plateau as China
struggles with its lack of innovative talent]{.underline}. This
[limiting factor cannot be easily overcome by government
legislation]{.underline}, as it must be fostered through a culture of
entrepreneurship, something that the country is sorely missing. In
recent years, China has been importing its AI talent from overseas.
According to LinkedIn's Global AI Talent report published in July 2017,
44% of the overseas AI talent working in China comes from the US,
followed by the UK and France as the second and third source countries.
Roughly 90% of AI positions advertised in Mainland China go unfilled
unless companies offer them to overseas workers. The number of Chinese
AI job postings on LinkedIn surged from about 50,000 in 2014 to 440,000
in 2016, according to Wang Di, vice-president of LinkedIn China. China
ranked 40th and 31st out of 63 countries in the IMD World Talent Report
and Digital Competitiveness Report, respectively. [Educational
barriers]{.underline} The Chinese AI innovation chasm [Inhibiting
creativity starts in school]{.underline} and carries through higher
education. Jack Ma, founder of the Alibaba Group, [suggests that the
Chinese education system does not give students enough time to have fun,
explore and experiment]{.underline}. It is often in these moments that
great ideas are born. Chinese students, especially at university level,
are so consumed by academics that they rarely get an opportunity to
experiment with outside-the-classroom learning and growth. [A
study]{.underline} conducted by researchers from Kyungpook National
University in South Korea to analyze creativity in Chinese and Korean
universities [concluded that Chinese students at top-ranked institutions
were less creative than those at less prestigious
institutions]{.underline}. Once they enter the workforce, these
graduates struggle to step out of their disciplined and rigidly
structured environment. [As a consequence, they tend to produce
superficial, mechanical innovations that require little
imagination]{.underline}. Students who enter top Chinese universities,
through China's brutal Gaokao entrance exams, have their creativity
muted by a system that rewards rote memorization over original thinking.
[While China produces twice as many college graduates as the United
States, it fails to cultivate entrepreneurial and creative spirit in
these highly educated workers]{.underline}. Overcoming cultural barriers
[Culture also plays an important role]{.underline}. Whereas risk-taking
and entrepreneurship are woven into the fabric of many Western cultures,
the Chinese mentality is imbued with unity, obedience and reputation.
Both China's current communist system and its ancient culture have long
stressed the importance of social cohesion. Rather than prioritizing
their own interests, [people are encouraged to think
collectively]{.underline}, placing the majority over the individual. The
stress placed on saving face [means that people are scared to take
risks]{.underline} out of fear of damaging their social standing. These
powerful cultural norms are a threat to the development of
courageousness in innovation, which is a necessary condition for
creating new ideas. Moreover, Confucianism highlights the importance of
showing obedience to superiors. Thus, workers will often blindly follow
their leaders without question. These cultural factors thus become a
limitation to what Chinese companies can produce qualitatively. It
cannot help that, [because of government censorship, AI researchers in
China do not have access to key research tools]{.underline}, like
Google. Chinese digital giants, like Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu, have
compensated for these cultural barriers with speed and agility. Frequent
tiny, incremental changes can add up to large innovations over time.
Tencent's WeChat started out as a direct copy of WhatsApp, but through
thousands of rounds of iterative improvement, it has become something
much more impressive. However, AI is unchartered territory, and
innovations tend to be less linear than for apps, games, and
marketplaces. It is unlikely that Chinese giants can use fast,
incremental approaches to compensate for a lack of AI innovation.
Crossing the AI Innovation Chasm China has the potential to become the
preeminent global superpower in AI innovation. Money and other resources
are available and its people have boundless intellectual capacity. [At
the moment]{.underline}, however, [the cultural climate with respect to
innovation is very restrictive]{.underline}. By fostering creativity
from an early age, and reducing structural barriers, China's model for
AI development would become more sustainable. Heavy R&D investment will
boost the economy for a while, but [a continued lack of innovative
talent may leave it at standstill]{.underline}.

\"overblown]{.underline}.\" He also noted that [there are plenty of
benefits that humans could gain from having super advanced artificial
intelligence]{.underline}. \"[Because the benefits are so
huge]{.underline}, that if we don\'t use AI technologies [we\'re going
to be losing out on all of these beneficial effects in health care, in

on advancing artificial intelligence because humans could really lose
out on all of the benefits of this new technology]{.underline}. However,
there are many aspects of artificial intelligence that scientists and
researchers need to figure out better. \"I think [it\'s worthwhile to
think about these research questions around AI and ethics, and AI and
safety]{.underline},\" Campbell explained. Because of the increase in
interest regarding artificial intelligence, the White House has
announced four public workshops about the technology. These workshops

intelligence, Fortune reports.

[The global competition between the United States and China continues
apace]{.underline}. [Technology is rightly seen as providing unique
leverage]{.underline} to win this geopolitical race. [The U.S. long has
been the global technology powerhouse]{.underline}, [but]{.underline}
not surprisingly, [we have heard much about the Chinese government's
ambition to dominate high-tech industries]{.underline} such as 5G
telecommunications, autonomous vehicles, blockchain, and semiconductor
chips. In this light, as a horizontal technology that can be applied
across all sectors, artificial intelligence ([AI]{.underline}) [has
become a strategic priority]{.underline} and the [Chinese focus on
superiority in this field is touted as something about which the U.S.
should be concerned]{.underline}. S[ome have gone so far as to conclude
that the West has already lost the AI race]{.underline}. [Don't believe
the hype]{.underline}. To be sure, the availability of large amounts of
data is at the heart of AI success. It is tempting to think that
less-democratic regimes that amass huge amounts of data about their
citizens and have scant regard for privacy can develop better AI systems
using that data. However, all other things being equal, better and
[higher quality AI systems emerge from countries with strong data
privacy and data protection regulations because AI systems must undergo
greater scrutiny during their development and deployment]{.underline}.
An example of this can be seen in the United States regarding fair
lending practices and consumer protection from credit bureaus. Further,
the market for AI is global, and such high-quality AI systems find
buyers in other countries as well. [Around the globe, Big Tech's rising
power has resulted in calls for more oversight]{.underline}. In a
drastic move that stunned the industry and analysts alike, [the Chinese
government recently rewrote the rulebook for the country's technology
industry]{.underline}. In effect[, China is vacating entire swaths of
digital and creative industries]{.underline}, arenas that serve as
training grounds and talent factories for other industries. [This more
restrictive approach may not bode well for China's AI]{.underline}
industry [in the long term]{.underline}. [China may find itself
constrained on the extent of automation and AI in its manufacturing
sector]{.underline} --- labor-intensive manufacturing remains China's
main strength, and a high degree of automation can result in job losses,
labor unrest, and instability. Meanwhile, [there is bipartisan support
for AI in the United States]{.underline}. Former President Trump
proposed increasing funding for AI development through the National
Science Foundation. The National AI Initiative Act of 2020 signaled a
sense of urgency and suggested that several federal agencies create a
national strategy on artificial intelligence. The Biden administration
has formed the Artificial Intelligence Research Resource Task Force to
develop a roadmap to foment AI research and spark innovation nationwide.
There is draft legislation, at both the state and federal level, to
promote responsible use of AI and prevent its misuse. Strong objections
to the use of facial recognition and other AI systems by law enforcement
in the U.S., raised by civil liberties advocates, have led some local
authorities, such as the City of San Francisco, to ban such systems. To
use a Silicon Valley phrase, these [debates]{.underline} are "not a bug,
but a feature." They shine a light on the limitations [of AI
systems]{.underline} and help to set the "rules of the road" for proper
use of AI. This **[will establish the U.S. as a global leader in AI
regulation]{.underline}**, once lawmakers and regulators do their work.
[China, meanwhile, has faced strong global criticism]{.underline} for
using facial recognition software to monitor and surveil Uyghurs in its
Xinjiang region. [China has outlined a set of AI ethics principles, but
the jury is still out on enforcement and how they function in
practice]{.underline}. [The increasing number of AI research papers and
patents by Chinese researchers is often cited as proof that China has
caught up with the United States]{.underline} in this field. The
increased focus is good for the Chinese AI ecosystem, and it will help
them solve China-specific problems. [But dominance in this emerging
strategic industry is not guaranteed]{.underline}. [The U.S. has several
strategic advantages]{.underline}, including: the strengths of its
[higher education and research institutes]{.underline}, which attract
the best STEM talent from across the world; [the largest venture capital
ecosystem]{.underline}; [and the largest number of technology
unicorns]{.underline} (start-ups with private valuations greater than
\$1 billion). [China is not overtaking the U.S. in artificial
intelligence]{.underline}. The current evidence and trajectory paint a
clear picture: [The conditions for AI to flourish]{.underline}, such as
incentives to experiment, freedom to pursue opportunities without
restrictions, and the coming guardrails to prevent misuse, [favor U.S.
leadership]{.underline}. This is still the United States's game to lose
--- though maybe both countries could win through collaboration. To
solve planet-scale problems such as climate change, we are going to need
AI solutions from both competitors.

### 2ac \-\-- China Great Power War

#### The risk of great power war is high -- it could cause nuclear escalation

**Brands, 18** -- Henry Kissinger Distinguished Professor at Johns
Hopkins University\'s School of Advanced International Studies and a
senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments
(Hal, "Great-Power Rivalry Is Back. The U.S. Is Playing Poorly."
Bloomberg View, 2/28,
<https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-02-28/trump-s-losing-the-great-game-against-putin-and-xi>

Having reconstituted its military power, [[Russia has been reasserting
its dominance along its Central Asian and Eastern European
peripheries]{.underline}, [challenging NATO and undermining the
E]{.underline}]{.mark}uropean [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nion, [and
projecting [its military power deep into the Middle
East]{.mark}]{.underline} \-- all in addition to seeking to weaken and
divide the U.S. through information warfare and other means.

Riding an economic and military rise unprecedented in modern history,
[[China has been seeking to re-establish]{.underline}]{.mark} its former
[mastery in [the Asia-Pacific]{.mark}]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
perhaps eventually [[compete with the U.S. on a global]{.mark}
[scale]{.mark}]{.underline} as well. All this is normal enough; it is
the warp and woof of great-power rivalry. Yet it has uniquely dangerous
implications for the U.S. and the international system it leads.

[As relations between the [major powers become more rivalrous, it
becomes harder to achieve cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} on matters
that require multilateral action. Since 2011, for instance, U.S.-Russian
rivalry has continually frustrated international efforts to bring the
Syrian civil war to an end. As Russia and China assert their influence,
they are also increasingly contesting the global rules of road \--
freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, the illegitimacy of
altering borders by force \-- that have underpinned international peace
and prosperity for generations.

Likewise, [the return of great-power rivalry raises the possibility that
a hostile power might come to exert dominant influence]{.underline} in
one of the key regions of the world \-- a nightmare of U.S. strategists
reaching back roughly a century. Finally, [this competition is a
potential pathway to]{.underline} the most [cataclysmic]{.underline}
phenomenon that can afflict the international environment: [war between
the major powers.]{.underline}

[These dangers are not]{.underline} as [far-fetched]{.underline} as they
may seem. [In East Asia, China has used maritime coercion to sprint
toward a position of dominance in the South China and East China
Seas]{.underline}, while also shifting the regional military balance
through a two-decade buildup meant to keep the U.S. from projecting
power into the Western Pacific.

[Russia has demonstrated that it will use force to keep states like
Georgia and Ukraine from tilting too far toward the West]{.underline},
and Moscow's military buildup has given it a pronounced local advantage
on NATO's exposed eastern flank.

Indeed, [the prospect of great-power war is becoming steadily less
remote. Chinese strategists are reportedly preparing for a "short, sharp
war" with the U.S.]{.underline} and its East Asian allies, [and Russian
doctrine now reportedly emphasizes the]{.underline} limited [use of
nuclear weapons to achieve "escalation dominance]{.underline}" in a
conflict. And as the intensity of great-power competition rises, the
Trump administration is largely fumbling the American response.

### 2ac/1ar \-\-- China Leadership Fails

#### Chinese leadership fails -- the US is successful

**Zhao, 18** -- Suisheng Zhao is professor and director of the Center
for China-US Cooperation at Josef Korbel School of International
Studies, University of Denver ("A Revisionist Stakeholder: China and the
Post-World War II World Order" Journal of Contemporary China, DOI:
10.1080/10670564.2018.1458029

But China is not ready. First, as one Chinese scholar admitted, '[China
does not have the comprehensive national strength to change the current
global order]{.underline} led by the US and other Western countries for
more than 70 years'.41 [A fragile rising power much weaker than most
outsiders think, China is a middle-income country, facing immense
internal hurdles, such as the environmental destruction, rampant
corruption, inequality, and huge local government deb]{.underline}t, all
of which have the potential to derail its rise. Preoccupied by mounting
challenges, [Chinese leaders have to fight an uphill battle to mobilize
resources and internal support for the global leadership
role]{.underline}. China is far from achieving the donor status of many
OECD countries. For one prominent Chinese scholar, the most dangerous
challenge is the extreme-leftist policy-line and 'the false-large-empty'
(假大空) slogans, making international promises and setting strategic
objectives beyond the reach of China's national strength.42 China's
international initiatives do not play a critical role in China's rise
but are the consequences of its rise.

Although some scholars have claimed that the US power was declining so
that the post-World War II order was suffering from an acute case of
Anno Domini, they may have to recant their predictions. [With the
world's largest concentration of capital and technology, the US remains
the most powerful nation.]{.underline} China has faster GDP growth than
the US, but its net national wealth, i.e. the resources available to
pursue national interests, is still not in America's league. From
2000--2012, Chinese net wealth jumped from \$4.66 trillion to \$21.7
trillion. American net wealth over the same period rose from \$42.3
trillion to \$67.5 trillion. From 2012 to 2017, while Chinese net wealth
climbed to \$29 trillion, American net wealth reached to over \$93
trillion. [Claiming that China is about to eclipse the US is untenable
in the face of \$64 trillion less in net wealth]{.underline}. The
resource advantage rests overwhelmingly with the US.43

China has pushed RMB internationalization. But the share of RMB in
global payment is below 2% while US dollar share remains above 40%. RMB
accounts for a scant 1% of global reserves while the US dollar accounts
for over 60%. The drive to internationalize RMB has not gained momentum
since its inclusion in the SDR basket in 2015.44 Shortly before
inclusion, China's Central Bank announced a 'market-oriented' mechanism
for setting the daily benchmark of the exchange rate, accompanied by 2%
devaluation, the first since 1994, leading the onshore RMB to tumble by
4% in the subsequent two days. The Central bank intervened massively to
halt the slide in the weeks after. Less than two months after RMB's
inclusion in the IMF basket, the central bank imposed new controls over
capital outflow.45 These difficulties have made the cost outweigh the
benefits of RMB internationalization.

Remaining the 'indispensable nation' of the world, the US cannot avoid
the responsibility to provide public goods and security protection for
its allies. [Although]{.underline} President [Trump has]{.underline}
distanced Washington from its traditional allies and [stepped back from
global leadership, the American economy and geopolitics encourage a
global outlook, imposing compelling imperatives]{.underline} on the
superpower. Woven thickly into global value chains, protectionism calls
for other countries' retaliation against American producers and shifts
burdens to American consumers. [With checks and balances in the US
constitution]{.underline} and the dynamism of the open society,
[economic liberals and internationalists in the US
Government]{.underline} and across the states [have been powerful
countervailing forces against protectionism and
disengagement]{.underline}. In spite of President Trump's isolationist
position, 'American national interests endure. They include preventing
any hostile power from dominating Asia, Europe, or the energy resources
of the Middle East; sustaining an open international economic and
political order, not subverted by spheres of influence that exclude the
United States; protecting free access to the global commons, especially
the maritime sea lanes that carry 90 % of global trade; nurturing
alliances that magnify American power and influence; and promoting
democracy and human rights, because the ultimate source of global
security is a world in which power is bounded by law and pluralistic
institutions'.46

Second, China cannot provide shared values and other elements of soft
power to commons willingness on the part of other countries to align,
and in some cases subordinate, their own narrow interests to those of
the larger international community. China has made significant
investments in developing its soft power with the opening of more than
500 Confucius Institutes across the world and carrying out extensive
international branding campaigns. But China is not successful in
projecting its values and ideals that others identify with and aspire to
share. The US leadership comes with willing followers and trust through
a network of alliances and other ties. For all of their differences with
Washington and periodic resentment of its policies, many countries
invested more confidence in the US than in any other nation. [China does
not possess the attributes that underpin US leadership. It lacks allies
and inspires little trust in its own neighborhood. Its efforts to
project soft power often fail to resonate]{.underline} abroad partly
because China displays little empathy with the sensitivities of those
living beyond its borders.47

[While US global influence has dropped]{.underline} due to President
Trump's policy, [it still holds much more soft power than
China]{.underline}. Against the background of seemingly retreating
democracy, China's authoritarianism appears to be more appealing to
autocracies. But this has not been accompanied by serious and
significant interest worldwide in China's development model. Promoting
globalization, the Chinese Government is doing the opposite by imposing
controls on the inflow of information and outflow of capital, leading
people to question the sincerity of its posited global leadership.

A Chinese scholar admits that China might one day overtake the US in the
size of economy but may never overtake the US influence and leadership
in the world.48 Another Chinese scholar finds that China is short of
international discursive power (国际话语权缺失). China had never played
a world leadership role in history. The traditional Chinese system
(华夏体系) was only an East Asian system, not universal, and cannot
automatically transform into modern discursive power.49 Until China
develops values that appeal universally, it misses one of the core
features of global leadership.

#### China's overreliance on economic power prevents it from effectively [exercising]{.underline} leadership

**Zhao, 18** -- Suisheng Zhao is professor and director of the Center
for China-US Cooperation at Josef Korbel School of International
Studies, University of Denver ("A Revisionist Stakeholder: China and the
Post-World War II World Order" Journal of Contemporary China, DOI:
10.1080/10670564.2018.1458029

[Beijing's overreliance on its economic prowess as the key diplomatic
instrument reveals the shortage of normative power]{.underline}. Despite
its growing economic and military might, [China's efforts to use
economic ties to influence other state's behavior have only achieved
limited success because money cannot buy loyalty.]{.underline} Influence
does not simply derive from a country's coffers. While [closer economic
ties are]{.underline} important, they are [hardly sufficient to build
strong trust between countries]{.underline}---especially those with
conflicting security interests. This is clearly reflected in China's
relationship with Japan, characterized as hot economics and cold
politics. it is reflected in China's relations with North Korea, a
country that is widely perceived as economically dependent on China for
its own survival but has often taken actions against China's strategic
interests. To play a global leadership role, China has to build the
ability to inspire other countries to share its vision. The [leadership
will not work itself out only through economic ties]{.underline}.
Building common identity and value is equally, if not more, important.

Unable to construct shared values, [China may change nothing of
substance]{.underline} in the global order. While China's insistence on
the Westphalian principles looks attractive to some countries where
intense interventionism by the US often ends in chaos and chronic
instability, many of China's neighbors view China's great power
aspiration with a wary eye, worrying that, as Chinese power rises,
China's imperial past can produce an undue pressure on its leaders to
restore the old Chinese hierarchical order. One reporter took note that
at the 60th anniversary of the Bandung Conference that gave birth to the
Five-Principles, only two notable leaders turned up. One was President
Xi, who used the occasion to portray China as the leader of the
non-western world. The other was Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who
suggested that the threat to the sovereignty of smaller countries no
longer came from the West.50

[China's power aspirations in a diverse and crowded neighborhood are
checked by the presence and influence of the US and other regional
powers.]{.underline} The Twenty-first century has seen a multipolarity
rather than a Chinese hegemony. [While China is rising, many surrounding
states are also on the rise.]{.underline} [China's shift from espousing
a peaceful rise to assertive behavior has made its neighbors nervous,
motivating them to realign with the US]{.underline} and with each other
to balance China.51 A May 2017 ASEAN survey found that more than 73 % of
correspondents had little or no confidence that Beijing would do the
right thing in contributing to global peace, security, and governance.52
A regional Pax Sinica is not desirable for these countries.
Historically, to bandwagon with a rising power is common practice due to
potentially great relative gains. The most successful rising powers most
often attracted the greatest number of bandwagoners.53 It does not serve
China's interests to have tension with many neighbors simultaneously.
China cannot rise successfully without winning the support of its
neighbors or at least preempt their balancing motives.

#### Chinese leadership fails and can't replace the US

**Beeson, 17** - Professor of International Politics at Murdoch
University in Perth, Western Australia (Mark, "Why Has Leadership in the
Asia--Pacific Proved So Elusive?" Chin. Polit. Sci. Rev. (2017)
2:567--581 https://doi.org/10.1007/s41111-017-0074-y

Paradoxically enough, however, in the aftermath of the election of
Donald Trump, [China has emerged as]{.underline} an unexpected [champion
of 'globalization']{.underline}. In part, this reflects a recognition on
the part of China's leaders that the country has been one of the
principal beneficiaries of an open international economic order. At the
same time, however, Xi (2017) in particular clearly sees an opportunity
for China to reposition itself as precisely the sort of 'responsible
stakeholder' that some have long called for (Zoellick 2005). At a time
when the Trump administration seems to be abandoning the traditional
American role in favor of a more instrumental, nationalistic approach to
trade and even security policy (Browne 2017; Hodge 2017), Chinese
officials have been quick to seize the moment and the initiative.

[There are, however, continuing constraints]{.underline} confronting
China [that raise real questions about its ability to offer]{.underline}
a l[eadership]{.underline} at the regional, much less the global level.
First, the extant international order will not be easily replaced, nor
will America's role within it. The fact remains that [the US is still
the world's preeminent economic and military power]{.underline}, albeit
one with diminished status and damaged authority. Second, [China has
shown little desire or capacity to articulate an alternative vision for
the international system]{.underline}, thus far, [and seems willing to
work within existing institutional architecture]{.underline} [and
**avoid the costs associated with leadership**]{.underline} (Wang and
French 2014). Third, [leaders need followers, and]{.underline} at this
stage---despite an apparently growing diplomatic influence in Southeast
Asia---[it has few allies and frien]{.underline}ds. Indeed, the fourth
point to make is that [China's continuing pursuit of its own
nationalistic goals, especially its claims in the South China Sea
dispute, look certain to **make its future relations and role divisive
and contentious**]{.underline}.

#### No other power can replace the US -- retrenchment guarantees global conflict

**Haass, 17** -- president of the Council on Foreign Relations (Richard,
"America and the Great Abdication" The Atlantic, 12/28,
http://www.washingtonspeakers.com/images/pdfs/America%20and%20the%20Great%20Abdication%20-%20The%20Atlantic.pdf

[An optimist would]{.underline} also [hope that other countries would
pick up where the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [left off in
promoting international order]{.underline}. The fact is, though, that
[there is no alternative great power willing and able to step
in]{.underline} and assume what has been the U.S. role. [China is often
suggested, but its leadership is focused mostly on consolidating
domestic order and maintaining artificially high rates of economic
growth, lest there be popular unrest]{.underline}. [China's interest in
regional and global institutions]{.underline} (including both its
regional trade mechanism and its "One Belt, One Road" infrastructure
initiative) [seems more designed to bolster its economy and influence
than to help set rules and arrangements that would be broadly
beneficial]{.underline}. [China's assertiveness in the South China
Sea]{.underline} (including its rejection of an international legal
ruling challenging its claims) [and its unwillingness to do all it could
to rein in North Korea casts further doubts as to its readiness to fill
the shoes of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.

[There is no other candidate. Russia]{.underline} under Vladimir Putin
[is a country with a narrowly based economy that is focused on retaining
power at home,]{.underline} reestablishing Russian influence in the
Middle East and Europe, and interfering in the internal politics of
Western democracies. It is mostly a spoiler prepared to use those
instruments of power it possesses (military, energy, and cyber) to
advance its aims. [India is preoccupied with the challenge of economic
development]{.underline} and is tied down by its problematic
relationship with Pakistan. [Japan is held back by its declining
population, domestic constraints, and the suspicions of its neighbors.
Europe is limited in what it can do by a lack of defense
capability]{.underline}, and is distracted by questions revolving around
the relationship between member states and the EU. [The cold truth is
that the alternative to a U.S.--led international order is less
international order]{.underline}.

[All this comes at a time challenges to order are many, including a
China that is trying to extend its writ over the South China Sea and a
North Korea that appears intent on developing the ability to place
nuclear warheads on ballistic missiles]{.underline} capable of reaching
not just its neighbors but across the world and an Iran with an imperial
vision of its position in the Middle East. [The Middle East is a region
of multiple conflicts of every sort]{.underline}---civil, regional,
proxy, and global---involving state and nonstate actors, as well as a
mixture of strong, weak, and failed states[. There is as well the
continuing Russian occupation of Crimea and its destabilization of
eastern Ukraine]{.underline}, the undermining of democracy and economic
deterioration of Venezuela, and any number of governance failures in
Africa, most starkly in South Sudan. There has been a marked
deterioration in U.S. relations with Russia, the result not just of its
military actions in Ukraine and Syria but also of its interference in
the 2016 U.S. presidential election. And [at the global level there is
the continuing gap between challenges and collective
responses,]{.underline} none more pronounced than in the domain of
cyberspace.

### 2ac/1ar \-\-- Deterrence Works

#### The perception of [resolve]{.underline} is a greater predictor of how war starts than any other factor -- China prioritizes it over capabilities

**Mastro 15**-an assistant professor of security studies at the Edmund
A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, "Why
Chinese Assertiveness is Here to Stay", The Washington Quarterly, 21 Jan
2015, <https://www.ciaonet.org/attachments/27434/uploads)//SL> **italics

These efforts are commendable---the United States rightly works to
preserve its military superiority and retain its ability to project
power in the region. During the Cold War, when the greatest pacing
threats were land conflicts, forward deploying U.S. forces in Europe and
Asia were sufficient to demonstrate the credibility of the U.S.
commitment to peace in those regions. But [[China is]{.mark} currently
[testing the waters]{.mark} not [because its leaders are]{.mark}
uncertain about the balance of power, but because they are [probing the
balance of ***resolve***]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This means that
staying ahead in terms of military might is insufficient in contemporary
East Asia.

China's strategists are betting that the side with the strongest
military does not necessarily win the war---the foundation of the
deterrent pillar of its A2/AD strategy. Indeed, China's experience in
fighting the Korean War proves that a country willing to sacrifice blood
and treasure can overcome a technologically superior opponent. [[The
belief that]{.mark} balance of [resolve drives outcomes more]{.mark} so
[than]{.mark} the balance of [power is the foundation of
China's]{.mark}]{.underline} new, more [[assertive
strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}; but U.S. responses to date have failed to
account for it. Canned demonstrations of U.S. power fail to address the
fundamental uncertainty concerning U.S. willingness, not ability, to
fight.

[[The U.S. focus on de-escalation]{.underline}]{.mark} in all situations
[only **[exacerbates this]{.mark}** issue]{.underline}. The Cold War
experience solidified the Western narrative stemming from World War I
that inadvertent escalation causes major war, and therefore crisis
management is the key to maintaining peace.74 This has created a
situation in which [the main U.S. goal has been de-escalation in each
crisis]{.underline} or incident [with Beijing. But [Chinese
leaders]{.mark} do not share this mindset---they [believe leaders
deliberately control the escalation process]{.mark} and therefore wars
happen because leaders decide at a given juncture that the best option
is to fight]{.underline}.75 [China is masterful at chipping away at U.S.
credibility through advancing militarization and coercive diplomacy. It
often uses limited military action to credibly signal its willingness to
escalate if its demands are not met]{.underline}. Strategist Thomas
Schelling theoretically captured this approach when he wrote it is "the
sheer inability to predict the consequences of our actions and to keep
things under control ... that can intimidate the enemy."76

[Because China introduces risk for exactly this reason, [the U.S. focus
on deescalation]{.mark} through crisis management is unlikely to produce
any change in Chinese behavior---if anything it [will only **encourage
greater provocations**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Beijing has identified
the U.S. fear]{.mark} of inadvertent [escalation, and is exploiting it
to compel the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[to give in to its demands]{.mark} and preferences]{.underline}. In
this way, [[the U.S. focus on de-escalation **may actually be the source
of instability** by rewarding]{.mark} [and encouraging further Chinese
provocations]{.mark}]{.underline}. [To signal to China that the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will not opt out of a
conflict, [Washington must **signal willingness to escalate**]{.mark} to
higher levels of conflict [when China is]{.mark} directly and purposely
[testing U.S. resolve]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [This may include
**reducing channels of communication during a
conflict**]{.underline},]{.mark} or involving additional regional
actors, to credibly demonstrate that China will not be able to use
asymmetry of resolve to its advantage.

The current mindset---that crisis management is the answer in all
scenarios--- will be difficult to dislodge, given the tendency among
U.S. military ranks to focus on worst-case "great battle" scenarios.
While realistic in Cold War operational planning, [decision makers
should consider instead the less violent and prolonged engagements that
characterize Chinese coercive diplomacy when evaluating risk and
reward]{.underline}, such as the 1962 Sino--Indian War or the 1974
Battle of the Paracel Islands. [[The idea that any conflict with China
would escalate to a major war]{.mark}, destroy the global economy, and
perhaps even escalate to a nuclear exchange [has no foundation in
Chinese thinking, and causes the U]{.mark}]{.underline}[n]{.mark}ited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[to concede in even the smallest
encounters]{.underline}]{.mark}. [While the Chinese leadership has
proven to be more risk-acceptant than the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates (or perhaps more accurately, to assess the risks to
be less than those perceived by U.S. strategists), **[[Xi still wants to
avoid an armed conflict at this stage]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In his
November 2014 keynote address at the Central Foreign Affairs Work
Conference, he noted that China remains in a period of strategic
opportunity in which efforts should be made to maintain the benign
strategic environment so as to focus on internal development.77

Ultimately, the U.S. regional objective must be peace and stability at
an acceptable cost. Given this, it is critical to understand the four
components of China's A2/AD strategy, the strategic foundation for
China's recent assertiveness, and how best to maintain the U.S. position
as a Pacific power. In addition to regularly attending meetings in the
region and developing new technology, new platforms, and new operational
concepts designed to defeat China's A2/AD strategy, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [needs to]{.underline} break
free of its Cold War-based paradigm paralysis and [rethink conceptions
of limited war, escalation, and risk]{.underline}.

Scolding China and imposing symbolic costs for each maritime incident is
unlikely to inspire the corrective change U.S. thinkers are hoping for.
[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[needs
to]{.mark} fundamentally change its approach by **[accept]{.mark}ing
[higher risk]{.mark}** [and **allowing for the possibility of
escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline}---both vertically in force as well as
horizontally to include other countries. This admittedly is a difficult
balance, especially given the need to avoid emboldening U.S. allies to
take actions that run contrary to U.S. interests. But [only
by]{.underline} mastering these two balancing acts---focusing on
balancing resolve, rather than forces, and [prioritizing stability over
crisis management---will the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[be able to maintain peace and stability in East Asia]{.underline}
without sacrificing U.S. or allied interests.

### 2ac/1ar \-\-- No Mindset Shift

#### Ceding to China destroys US influence AND no mindset shift -- policymakers are [locked in]{.underline}

**Layne 18** - professor at Texas A&M University\'s. George H. W. Bush
School of Government and Public Service (Christopher, "The US--Chinese
power shift and the end of the Pax Americana," 2018,

Accessed 6-30-22, LASA-AH)

The lock-in strategy also assumes that if the Pax Americana's
institutions are reformed, Beijing (and other non-western emerging
powers) will find it more attractive to remain in the post-1945
international order than to overturn it. [That assumption, however, is
logically flawed: achieving lock-in by reforming the existing
international order presumes that the United States can have its cake
(preserving the Pax Americana) and eat it too (reforming the current
international system's legacy institutions). But, as we all know, **when
the cake is eaten, it's gone.** [Reform]{.mark}]{.underline}---at least,
any kind of reform that would appeal to China---[would [mean the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates **[yield]{.mark}ing significant [power
]{.mark}**[in international]{.mark} [institutions]{.mark} to accommodate
Beijing.]{.underline} However, [[doing so would reduce US ability to
shape outcomes]{.mark}, [diminish Washington]{.mark}'s voice [in
international]{.mark} [institutions]{.mark}, and [impose constraints on
US autonomy in foreign and domestic policy]{.mark}]{.underline}.79 As
University of Birmingham lecturer Sevasti-Eleni Vezirgiannidou observes
with respect to insti- tutional reform: '[It is [questionable
whether]{.mark} [this will]{.mark} really [preserve US influence]{.mark}
[or]{.mark} rather, on the contrary, **[diminish it]{.mark},** as the
United States will have to share power in a reformed order and thus will
be restricted in its ability to act unilaterally]{.underline}.'80 The US
foreign policy establishment may talk the talk of reforming the interna-
tional order (and the institutions that underpin it), but [it is
[doubtful it will]{.mark} walk the walk with respect to [reform]{.mark},
[because that **would mean**]{.mark} **[accepting a downsized American
role]{.mark} in international politics**.]{.underline} On the contrary,
Washington's opposition to the AIIB indicates that the United States is
not prepared to see its influence in the international order diminished.
And, with respect to reforming the post-1945 international order to
accommodate the reality of a risen China, this is the nub of the
problem: instead of preserving the Pax Americana, reform would lead to
changes in the international order that would undermine it. Of course,
[regardless of whether there is institutional reform, the coming decades
are likely to witness major changes in the international order
irrespective of America's preferences.]{.underline}

6.1 Model Case 1: [Island building in the South China Sea as a form of
Coercive hegemony]{.underline} [China continued to pursue through 2018
an aggressive strategy to expand and maintain a foothold in the South
China Sea. It claimed rocks, islets, and archipelagos in this body of
water to enlarge its maritime territory and reach deep into Southeast
Asia, close to the Malacca Strait]{.underline}. China achieved this
objective at the expense of several Southeast Asian states who also
claim jurisprudence in this area. These are Vietnam, the Philippines,
Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan. These states\' claims clash with China\'s
in the area that the Chinese refer to as the "Nine-Dash-Line." China
bases its territorial claim on historical maps, albeit they are not
entirely conclusive. A 2016 verdict by an International Tribunal based
in The Hague ruled negatively against China: In a case where the
Philippines filed a complaint against Chinese conduct disregarding its
maritime borders, the verdict ruled against China and in favour of the
Philippines. China, of course, ignored and disavowed the ruling, as well
as making clear that the tribunal did not have jurisdiction over the
matter (Phillips, Holmes, & Bowcott, 2016). [China has gone beyond
publicly announcing its territorial claim. Instead, it has actively
started to produce real and tangible facts by engaging in the process of
"island building."]{.underline} The construction process begins by China
taking an islet, which sometimes is not larger than a rock, and
transferring building materials via ship to create helipads, harbours,
and airstrips. [Some have compared these artificial islands with sort of
China\'s stationary aircraft carriers. China wants to send a loud and
clear signal to regional neighbours and the rest of the world,
particularly to other great powers. It wants to **underscore its
maritime territorial claims**, with absolute and full vigour and
unwavering resolve]{.underline}. Hence, rather than leaving unperturbed
uninhabited and partially submerged islands, rocks, and islets, without
any physical signs of territorial claim and sovereignty, China builds
this new-aged military bases. These are all projections of China\'s
geostrategic reach. [China\'s fortification drive and island-building
program in the South China Sea is consistent with revisionist and
coercive policies]{.underline}. It deliberately revises borders. This
trend is [reminiscent of the violent rising by other great powers in
history. France, Germany, and Imperial Japan]{.underline} in the 18th
and 20th centuries, respectively, pursued such territorial expansion and
aggressive practice. [This aggressive territorial expansion constitutes
the type of evidence that many analysts will cease on to conclude that
**China is on a collision course with other great powers and
neighbours**]{.underline}. The policy will lead to diplomatic and
possibly military conflict over these territories. In this sense, it
will be [a harbinger of China\'s violent rise.]{.underline}

6.2 Model Case 2: The emerging Sino-Russian Entente as a form of
coercive hegemony [At the end of the Chinese Revolution in 1949, the PRC
and the Soviet Union became close allies.]{.underline} Chairman Mao
[Zedong and]{.underline} Premier Josef [Stalin formally instituted this
political, ideological, and military alliance by negotiating and signing
the Treaty of Moscow in 1950.]{.underline} At this juncture, the Soviet
Union was the senior partner whereas the newly established PRC was the
junior member of the alliance. China was still recovering from the
Japanese occupation and protracted civil war. A decade after the signing
of the Moscow Treaty, it became evident that political interests and
ideology were not sufficiently strong to keep these two actors together
in an alliance. Thus, from 1960 onward, the Sino-Soviet split became
increasingly evident and pronounced, even including a 7-month undeclared
military border conflict in 1969 that exacerbated further the
Sino-Soviet split. The tense rivalry and differences between these two
communist actors ultimately led to a de facto end to the alliance in
1979. At this point, China\'s tendency to side with the West and the
United States became more evident, too. It led to the official opening
of relations with the United States in the same year. Already several
years prior, in 1972, unofficial diplomatic ties under President Nixon
and Secretary of State Kissinger opened the door to China. Renewed
relations led to China\'s gradual embrace of the market economy. This
decision was fundamental in China\'s development and economic success
from the early 1980s to approximately 2014. [Interestingly, though,
**China has grown closer to Russia more recently**.]{.underline} 11 We
identify two interconnected examples to highlight and underscore better
the recent Chinese and Russian connection: [First, it is China\'s tacit
support for Russia\'s annexation of Crimean, and, second, the treaty on
energy cooperation negotiated and signed by China and Russia
concomitantly to the annexation of Crimea and the escalation of the
Eastern Ukraine war in 2014. First, China\'s reaction to the Russian
annexation of Crimea was mute (]{.underline}Ministry of Foreign Affairs
of the People\'s Republic of China, 2014). We must emphasise that
[before 2005, the PRC would have severely condemned and sternly opposed
Russia]{.underline}. Russian annexation of Crimea was anathema to
China\'s fundamental principles and priorities (Sun, 2015). [On the one
hand, it was a violation of sovereignty and the noninterference in the
internal affairs of another country]{.underline}. On the other hand, the
[annexation challenged China directly on two additional fronts: First,
its zealous commitment to defend its territory against aggression and,
second, its commitment to protect minorities within Chinese borders.
Notwithstanding, **China remained uncharacteristically distant and
quiet.** Second, the media outlets reported the energy treaty with
Russia as the deepening of the Sino-Russian relationship amid the
Eastern Ukrainian crisis and Western sanctions against
Russia]{.underline}. It was also a Russian carrot extended to China for
its allegiance, tacit political support of the Crimea annexation, and
the significant Chinese financial package. [This agreement was crucial
for Russian prowess at a juncture when it was simultaneously fighting an
undeclared war in Eastern Ukraine and escalating its military
involvement in the Syrian civil war to protect the government of its
political ally, President Bashar al-Assad]{.underline}. In exchange for
its advanced hefty financial package, Russia agreed to sell oil and
natural gas at rates considerably lower than current market prices. 12
It is plausible to argue here that the PRC agreed to the terms of the
2014 energy agreement on two grounds. First, the economic benefits
accruing to China were too vast and attractive to ignore. Second, the
agreement granted the PRC the first opportunity and greatest
satisfaction to become the senior partner in the Sino-Russian alliance
since the signing of the Treaty of Moscow in 1950, when the Soviet Union
was the senior partner. [The trend in China\'s international relations
examined thus far would suggest a **Chinese move toward revisionism,
aggressiveness, and coerciveness** insofar as the PRC condoned Russia\'s
annexation of the Crimean Peninsula]{.underline}. Besides, [China and
Russia appear to **share their opposition against united actions** by
the West\'s politico-military alliance.]{.underline} The Sino-Russian
universal resistance against the West seems to be supported by evidence
from the West\'s sanctions against Russia in the aftermath of the
Eastern Ukrainian crisis. Chi[na\'s reaction suggests that it is
preparing the grounds in case of future challenges to its rise by the
West]{.underline}. It appears as if [China is signalling to the West and
the entire world that it is prepared to defend its place among great
powers, **even if it entails the use of force and mass
violence**]{.underline}. Such actions are consistent with the violent
ascent of rising great powers in the history of the world such as
Wilhelmine Germany and Imperial Japan. From this vantage point, the
previous analysis suggests that [China is on track to follow the
footsteps of those other yesteryear revisionists and coercive rising
hegemons.]{.underline}

This article attempted to decipher and explain China\'s rise and its
future direction as a significant leader in the international system.
First, consistent with the benevolent-hegemon type, we observed how
China\'s active involvement in the management of the global environment
and the UN PKMs indicate this possibility. Nonetheless, these are mainly
political activities rather than economic. [The [benevolent-hegemon
type]{.mark} would [suggest]{.mark} [proactive]{.mark} and
[liberal]{.mark} sociopolitical and economic
[practices]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus far, [[China]{.mark} does not
appear willing and able to implement these in the immediate future.
First, it [refuses to open]{.mark} its [national market fully]{.mark} to
the foreign competitor]{.underline}. [Second, it [maintains a]{.mark}
very [tight grip]{.mark} [on]{.mark} its [currency]{.mark} value [and
fluctuation]{.mark} [for]{.mark} narrow, [selfish]{.mark}, national
[interests]{.mark}. Third, it [rejects promoting freer and fairer
trade]{.mark} among all actors, irrespective of their level of
reciprocity.]{.underline} To be sure, China is a hugely wealthy actor,
but one that practices a type of neomercantilist approach in the
international market as evidenced by its business practices in the
global economy. Second, we also observed [[China\'s island-building
policy]{.mark} and its drive for the establishment of a Sino-Russian
Entente to neutralise a potential regional and systemic
enemy]{.underline}. [These are actions that we [categorise as consistent
with the **coercive-hegemon type**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} similar to
the cases of Wilhelmine Germany and Imperial Japan and in the 19th and

### 2ac/1ar \-\-- AT: China War

#### China can't fight -- imperial overstretch

**Blumenthal, 17** - Daniel Blumenthal is director of Asian Studies at
the American Enterprise Institute ("A Strategy for China's Imperial
Overstretch" The American Interest, 3/1,

<http://www.the-american-interest.com/2017/03/01/a-strategy-for-chinas-imperial-overstretch/>

Notwithstanding the facile talk of China's "gains" from Donald Trump's
imagined withdrawal from the world, [Beijing is]{.underline} no position
to lead the world. Instead it is **[very close to imperial
overstretch]{.underline}**. A new U.S. strategic approach should hasten
a Chinese reckoning with its geopolitical troubles.

Contrary to the recent, post-Davos "wisdom" about a new era of Chinese
global leadership, things do not look good for Beijing. [The Chinese
economy continues to struggle]{.underline} and Chinese Communist Party
(CCP) Secretary-General Xi Jinping believes that China faces a
deteriorating security environment. Even so, [China continues to expand
its grandiose foreign policy ambitions, slowly extending its control
over the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea [while
also planning to create a "New Silk Road" linking Asia with Europe. But
China is biting off more than it can chew.]{.underline}

The CCP was founded on an anti-imperialist doctrine and is offended by
the suggestion that it rules an empire. Nevertheless, it does. Indeed,
China is the world's last standing multi-ethnic empire. Its physical
borders today mirror those of China's last imperial dynasty, the Qing
Dynasty, whose emperors conducted the greatest imperial expansion in
China's history. From the 17th to 19th centuries, they succeeded in
conquering Xinjiang, Tibet, Mongolia, and Taiwan. By virtue of these
achievements, the Qing expanded the empire to a truly continental scale.

With the exception of Mongolia and Taiwan, all of the Qing's imperial
conquests, including Xinjiang and Tibet, are again under Chinese control
today. And Beijing has regained de facto suzerainty over Hong Kong as it
exerts close to total control over the city-state's politics.

Finally, the international community long ago accepted the CCP's
position that Taiwan is part of China, never mind that this "claim" is
mostly based on the Qing imperial conquest of the island more than a
century ago. Beijing's continued hold over its empire is unique in
global affairs. For some context, imagine if Turkey still controlled the
Ottoman lands of the Levant and the Middle East. Or for another
comparative image, what if the Austo-Hungarian empire still controlled
much of Europe?

Today the CCP's desire for more territory does not stop with the old
Qing maps. Though the Qing Empire was not a maritime power, the CCP has
"discovered" new imperial territories in its surrounding seas. Chinese
commentators frequently refer to China's "three million square
kilometers of blue territory," which would incorporate "nearly 90% of
the area within the major bodies of water within the First Island Chain,
including the Bo Hai, the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and the South
China Sea."

China has claimed everything within the "nine-dash line" as its
"indisputable territory"---this arbitrary series of dashes on Chinese
maps encompasses the South China Sea. To advance this claim, Beijing has
built over 3,000 acres of new "island" bases and deployed military
forces to help control the surrounding waters. It has set up a
provincial administration to govern these maritime "territories," which
directs its fleets of maritime militias and law enforcement agencies to
harass foreign vessels.

All told, China's territorial claims now extend from the westernmost
reaches of Xinjiang, bordering Afghanistan, to the easternmost point in
the East China Sea. The sheer expanse of Beijing's claims might explain
why Xi is so pessimistic about China's security. The PLA must defend an
overwhelming amount of land and maritime territory from "enemies"
foreign and domestic.

Nonetheless, [Xi]{.underline} Jinping [is pressing ahead
with]{.underline} a key component of his national development strategy,
called "One Belt One Road" ([OBOR]{.underline})---a network of economic
infrastructure projects linking China with more than sixty Central
Asian, Middle Eastern, and European countries. This plan is intended to
proceed along two distinct routes. First, the Silk Road Economic Belt,
consisting of rail routes and oil and natural gas pipelines, will
stretch overland from China, through Central Asia to Eastern Europe.

Second, the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, made up of a series of port
projects, will extend through the Indian Ocean and into the Suez Canal
to reach the Mediterranean Sea. The underlying promise of OBOR is that
Chinese infrastructure investment can link together China's maritime and
continental interests. [Xi wants this program to be his stamp on China's
future]{.underline}, just as Deng Xiaoping was known for the policy of
"reform and opening." In practice, [China will have even more territory
and assets to protect]{.underline}.

Where Are the Resources?

[Xi faces substantial economic headwinds as China enters a period of
long-term economic stagnation]{.underline}. After the 2008 financial
crisis, the Chinese government conducted one of the largest stimulus
plans in history, leading to overcapacity and debt. The PRC's national
debt is in excess of \$28 trillion. In a further sign of financial
deterioration, Beijing's foreign exchange reserves have fallen from \$4
trillion in mid-2014 to \$3 trillion at the end of 2016. China's GDP
growth rate has slowed to as little as half of what it once was during
the mid-2000s. Some believe that the statistics of recent years are
falsified, and that [the annual growth rate has been between 3 and 5
percent for at least three years]{.underline}. That still might seem
high for a Western country, but [for a China still under pressure to
create employment and social stability, it spells trouble
ahead]{.underline}.

In addition, China has a rapidly aging society as the result of decades
of the One-Child Policy. The Chinese workforce continues to shrink
annually and the expense of caring for hundreds of millions of elderly
Chinese is overwhelming. Beijing will spend vast sums of money cleaning
up its environment---remediating soil pollution alone could cost over
\$1 trillion. Even doing the minimum to address these social ills will
strain China's fiscal resources.

If Xi were to face a real cost-imposing strategic challenge from the
United States, it is hard to see how he could continue to devote the
necessary resources to all of his social and foreign policy aspirations.

The Costs of the Empire

In pursuit of his ambitious foreign policy strategy, Xi Jinping has
urged the Party to think of China as both a maritime and continental
power. The Chinese government has continued to devote resources both to
China's naval build-up and to its vast internal security enterprise. At
its current buildup rate, the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) could
have 430 major surface combatants and almost one hundred submarines by
2030. It is on the path to possessing the world's largest merchant
marine and coast guard fleet as well. While the defense budget growth is
slowing a bit, this past year the PLA still saw a budget increase of
nearly 8 percent.

To advance (or, from Beijing's perspective, protect) its maritime plans,
China has increased the tempo of its maritime exercises. For example, it
sent its first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, through the Miyako Strait
within Japan's southern island chain, in December 2016, going beyond the
first island chain to conduct drills in the Western Pacific. Its
maritime militias and coast guard fleets maintain a steady presence
around the Senkaku Islands. Chinese vessels continue to maintain a
presence around the Scarborough Shoal, which Beijing seized from Manila
in 2012. Meanwhile, PLA rocket forces continue to improve their lethal
precision strike capabilities, with over 1,000 SRBMs alone aimed across
the Taiwan Strait. The PLA's military build-up and increased "presence
missions" require substantial new budgetary outlays.

On China's mainland, 800,000 People's Armed Police (PAP) troops patrol
the streets of Chinese cities to crackdown on protests and prevent
violent uprisings, particularly in the western regions of Xinjiang and
Tibet. Within what is known as the "Han heartland," the CCP faces unrest
as well. In turn, Beijing has engaged in the harshest crackdown on
social and political activity since the massacre at Tiananmen Square.
Repression is expensive, as is running an empire.

Beijing's Continental Consolidation

The tenacious efforts by both the Republic of China and the PRC to
reacquire and consolidate the territory of the Qing Empire remains among
the least studied phenomena in China's strategic history. Instead, most
observers of China accept the official narrative of China's "century of
humiliation." While China was doubtless a victim of Western imperialism,
when it comes to imperialism, it has been no slouch itself.

All efforts by China, including [the OBOR plan]{.underline}, on the
Asian continent [are driven]{.underline} in part [by the need to pacify
its territorial periphery.]{.underline} A 2015 Chinese National
Development and Reform Commission report states:

We should make good use of Xinjiang's geographic advantages and its role
as a window of westward opening-up to deepen communication and
cooperation with Central, South and West Asian countries, make it a key
transportation, trade, logistics, culture, science and education center,
and a core area on the Silk Road Economic Belt.

There are doubtless many strategic and economic reasons for OBOR. Xi
wants to put his stamp on China's economic development strategy, rid his
economy of overcapacity, create new export markets, and attempt to
re-establish the centrality of the Middle Kingdom in world affairs. But
[the most pressing continental priority for Xi is to further integrate
Xinjiang into China proper and keep potential "separatists" at
bay]{.underline}.

This plan is all very expensive. If, according to Chinese estimates, all
OBOR infrastructure investment were realized, the bill would be \$6
trillion (not all paid by China, of course). The China Development Bank
already has stated that close to \$900 billion of projects are either
planned or underway. China will finance OBOR projects through
institutions such as the China Development Bank, the China Eximbank, the
Silk Road Fund, and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).

This all sounded plausible while Beijing enjoyed double-digit economic
growth for three decades. But now [China must make hard choices about
where to allocate its national security resources]{.underline}. Thus
far, the United States has not hastened that reckoning. But China's
current imperial overstretch provides Washington with an opportunity to
do so.

increasing influence.

[Internally]{.underline}, [Beijing's leaders face]{.underline} an
interwoven array of [[daunting social, environmental, economic, and
political problems that]{.underline}]{.mark}, left unresolved, [[will

power]{.underline}]{.mark} and could even threaten the Communist Party's
monopolistic grip on political and societal control. A brief look at
five of these issues makes clear the severity of the situation.

[Economic Restructuring]{.underline}: Some 100,000 state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) account for about half of China's economic assets.
Despite 15 years of reform efforts, [only half of]{.underline} the [SOEs
have been corporatized]{.underline}, and their return on assets is not
significantly different from those of the traditional SOEs. Overall,
[SOE financial performance has deteriorated]{.underline} significantly
since 2008, becoming a major drag on economic growth. [This drag serves
as a source of **serious political opposition**]{.underline} [to
enterprise reform]{.underline}, thereby [limiting the national
leadership's effort to focus on strategic sectors such as aviation,
energy, and telecommunications]{.underline}.13

Nevertheless, the impetus for reform has not slackened over the past
year, as both state and local SOEs have been selling off non-strategic
assets in accordance with Party policy direction. [[Serious political
obstacles to economic reform remain]{.underline},]{.mark} however,
including the fact that, for all of their inherent inefficiencies, [SOEs
predictably provide jobs to workers, who, if unemployed]{.underline},
might [question]{.underline} both [Party wisdom and]{.underline} its
unchallenged [supremacy]{.underline}. At the same time, [labor costs are
rapidly rising]{.underline}. In 2013, for example, China's 269 million
migrant workers earned an average of \$410 per month, an increase of
nearly 14 percent from 2012 and almost twice the rate of the nation's
GDP.14 As a result, [Chinese firms are being forced to
change]{.underline} their [enterprise models and export
strategies]{.underline} as foreign companies choose lower-wage
alternatives to China.15

The three-decade transition from an agrarian to industrial-service
economy, which saw the transition of some 300 million people from rural
to urban areas, will continue over the next two decades, with another
350 million people---a number in excess of the entire U.S.
population---still to follow. [The economic impact of]{.underline} this
colossal [resettlement has been staggering]{.underline}. Chinese
investment in real estate, which was \$120 billion in 2003, grew to
\$980 billion in 2011.Chinese investment in real estate, which was \$120
billion in 2003, grew to \$980 billion in 2011. [The infrastructure
required]{.underline} to support this exploding urban population [is
massive]{.underline}.16

Adding to these difficulties, [[PRC debt loads have
exploded]{.mark}]{.underline} over the past decade. [Government
debt]{.underline} (a large percentage of which is higher-risk local
government debt) to GDP ratio [stood]{.underline} [at 53.5 percent in
2012, up from 32.5 percent in 2005]{.underline}.17 Of greater concern is
[the recent rapid rise of total debt]{.underline} (encompassing that
from the corporate, household, and financial sectors), which [increased
from 150 percent of GDP in 2009 to 250 percent in
2014]{.underline}.18 Included in these figures are loans to SOEs that
have poor repayment records, but that are often protected by political
patronage. Moreover, the recent and dramatic rise of China's shadow
banking industry has complicated the central government's efforts to
bring lending under control.19 

[Aging Population & Social Welfare Costs]{.underline}: The scope and
pace of aging in China's population pose other significant economic
problems for the Party. Over the next twenty years, [[the ratio of
workers to retirees]{.underline}]{.mark} (at the current retirement age
of sixty) [will decrease from five-to-one to two-to-one]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} dramatic demographic shift [is]{.underline} both
[exacerbated and made more urgent by the success of the "one child
policy]{.underline}" in place since 1979. [It will]{.underline} not only
**[[erode]{.underline}]{.mark}** the huge **[[economic
stimulus]{.underline}]{.mark}** and advantage of a young working
population, but [it will also come at a point in China's modernization
when it is more vulnerable to the "middle income
trap]{.underline}."[20Huge expenditures will be required to put into
place]{.underline} more comprehensive [national health care and pension
systems]{.underline} to help avoid that potential pitfall.

[[Unequal Income Distribution]{.underline}]{.mark}: [China's gap between
its rich and poor]{.underline}, measured by its Gini coefficient, has
widened greatly since its opening to the world in 1979. In 2012, the
head of China's National Bureau of Statistics, Ma Jiantang, pegged it at
0.47-0.49, which is slightly below that of the United States, but high
for a developing country.21 [The reasons for this growing gap in wealth
distribution are well understood: rapid urbanization on the backs of
migrant workers not offered basic social services]{.underline} (a
variant of America's own illegal immigrant phenomenon, except that those
affected are PRC citizens); [the disparity in wealth between the coastal
regions and China's interior provinces]{.underline}; the cumulative
impact of [quality education and health care disproportionally available
to the Party, government, and urban elite]{.underline}; and [widespread
corruption]{.underline} (discussed below). In 2013, the Third Plenum of
the 18th Chinese Communist Party Congress noted the pressing need to
attend to this problem, but failed to offer any concrete proposals for
doing so.22

Environmental Degradation and Food Safety: [China's economic miracle has
occurred in tandem with environmental catastrophe]{.underline}. [Air and
water quality]{.underline}, especially in China's major urban areas, [is
among the worst in the world]{.underline}. In 2012, China's Vice
Minister of Environmental Protection, Wu Xiaoqing, stated that 40
percent of the country's rivers and 55 percent of its groundwater were
unfit for drinking. Moreover, he noted that in rural China some 320
million people lack access to safe drinking water.23 The cost of such
economic externalities came to roughly \$230 billion in 2010, or about
3.5 percent of GDP.24 [The scale of investment needed to adequately
address known environmental threats is extraordinary]{.underline}. For
example, between 2011 and 2020, the government plans to spend \$850
billion in water-related projects alone.25 Food safety is also a major
issue and an increasingly politicized one. It was only in the face of
mounting public pressure that the Ministry of Environmental Protection
admitted (in 2014) that the acreage of soil contamination (from heavy
metals, pesticides, and other toxins) of China's farmlands had reached a
record high of 20 percent.

Political Decay: [Most worrisome to China's leaders is the danger of
losing their monopoly on political power]{.underline}. President Xi
(like his predecessors) routinely calls official corruption a cancer
that, if unattended, will destroy the Party. But by [insisting on
exclusive occupation]{.underline} [of China's commanding political
heights]{.underline}, [the Party]{.underline} itself [becomes more
vulnerable to dysfunction, corruption, and political decay]{.underline}
as the number of political, economic, and social contradictions
multiply. China witnessed approximately 180,000 protests in 2010.
Reflecting Party anxieties, the state spends large sums of money to
ensure "stability maintenance." As recently as 2013, China's
expenditures for internal security exceeded those for its armed
forces.As recently as 2013, China's expenditures for internal security
exceeded those for its armed forces.26

Perhaps the Party leaders' greatest dilemma is that, while they
understand the need to decentralize economic and resource allocation
decision-making, they seem driven to pursue further political
consolidation in hopes that political and economic power can somehow be
disentangled. As a result, the development of an independent economic
entrepreneurial spirit, the establishment of a more robust rule of law
system, and the growth of civil society are all significantly retarded
in China, even as pressure for change continues to mount.

International Constraints on China's Rise

[[PRC leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} also **[[face daunting obstacles in
the international arena]{.underline}]{.mark}**. These include factors
related to history and geopolitics, military potential, and ideological
appeal.

History and Geography: China shares land borders with 14 countries,
three of which it has fought limited wars with during the past fifty
years: Russia (as the Soviet Union), Vietnam, and India. [A major land
dispute with India remains unresolved]{.underline}, [while China's
historical influence in the Russian Far East]{.underline} dating back to
the Qing Dynasty [continues to cause unease in Moscow]{.underline}.
[China's]{.underline} expansive [maritime claims in the East and South
China Seas have]{.underline} not only [stimulated increasingly fractious
disputes]{.underline} with Japan, the Philippines, and Vietnam,
[but]{.underline} have [also led to disagreements]{.underline} with
North Korea, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei. Pursuit of
these claims has also excited responses in Washington because they
involve two American treaty allies and potentially undermine the
principle of freedom of navigation---a vital U.S. security interest.27

Indeed, even as Party leaders seek to restore the prestige and influence
of dynastic empires in centuries past, [China's neighbors show no desire
to return to a tributary political order]{.underline}. Moreover, [China
is not an ethnically monolithic state]{.underline}. Its populace
includes restive non-Han Muslim citizens in its northwest Xinjiang
Province who have ethnic kin in Central Asia, as well as a large and
culturally distinct Tibetan population in its southwest. Additionally,
the PRC lays claim to ade facto independent, [democratic
Taiwan]{.underline} that [evinces little desire to unify with the
mainland]{.underline}. Even the full assimilation of Hong Kong has
proven both politically and socially challenging, as demonstrated by the
continuing pro-democracy movement. [[The]{.mark} tightening and
[expansion of Chinese power is **consistently contested**]{.mark} both
within its borders and in its immediate neighborhoods]{.underline}.

Military Limitations: [Despite extensive modernization]{.underline} over
the past 25 years, [the People's Liberation Army still lacks extended
force projection or sustained blue water naval
capabilities]{.underline}. China's military can bring impressive power
to bear at particular points along its border and near coastal areas. It
can also impose increasing costs on U.S. forces operating near its
territory. However, [**[the PLA lags far behind U.S. armed
forces]{.mark}** in terms of aggregate Asia-Pacific regional, and
especially global, capabilities.]{.underline}

Moreover, [given the costly political, economic, and social
challenges]{.underline} that [China's leaders must address over the next
two decades]{.underline}, [it seems unlikely]{.underline} that the
[Chinese armed forces will continue to enjoy the double-digit annual
budget increases]{.underline} that [it has been provided since the
mid-1990s]{.underline}. In addition, problems with corruption, a lack of
leadership initiative thanks to an over-centralized command structure,
and the still unproven ability of the PRC research and development
establishment to produce equipment and systems that rival those of the
United States and its key allies all cast doubt on the PLA's ability to
become a world-class military power in the near- to mid-term.

[Absence of Allies and Partners]{.underline}: [A state's power is
measured by its own usable capabilities and those of its relevant allies
and partners]{.underline} in various contingencies.Competent allies
magnify a state's power, and here [China is at a **tremendous
disadvantage** when compared with the United States]{.underline}.
Competent allies magnify a state's power, and here China is at a
tremendous disadvantage when compared with the United States. [China has
only one treaty ally]{.underline}---[North Korea]{.underline}---[and is
sharply at odds even with that regime]{.underline}, [whose interests are
not always in line which those of the PRC]{.underline}. [The one
cooperative security organization it nominally leads]{.underline}, the
Shanghai Cooperative Organization (SCO), includes Russia, Kazakhstan,
Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, but [no one takes]{.underline}
it [seriously]{.underline} as a functional military alliance. More
important, [the current warming relations between Moscow and Beijing
**will likely cool** once Beijing intensifies its efforts to establish a
new China-dominated Silk Road through Central Asia]{.underline}, a move
the Kremlin views as Chinese encroachment on a traditionally Russian
sphere of influence. Meanwhile, after losing its sway over its former
quasi-ally Myanmar, China's most reliable source of influence within
ASEAN is a struggling Cambodia. And to date, the PLA has yet to
establish any foreign military bases of consequence.

[The contrast with U.S. capabilities and assets could not be more
striking]{.underline}. In the Asia-Pacific region alone, America has
active military alliances with Japan, Korea, Australia, the Philippines,
and Thailand, and special relationships with Singapore, New Zealand, and
Taiwan. It has some 80,000 servicemen and servicewomen stationed
throughout the region. It also leads the 28-member NATO Alliance, the
most powerful military coalition in the world. [While China can
unilaterally apply concentrated pressure at specific locations on its
periphery, the United States can call upon a worldwide network of
friends and allies to flexibly deal with a wide variety of regional and
global security challenges.]{.underline}

[Weak Ideational Appeal]{.underline}: [China's]{.underline} global
economic power is significant but its [growth trajectory is
slowing]{.underline}. Even if Beijing can buy influence with its cash
reserves, its political model is not one that many states (never mind
Hong Kong and Taiwan) aspire to adopt, sharply limiting China's "soft
power" appeal. The United States ranks ahead of China around the world
(except in the Middle East) in favorability ratings, and significantly
so among those 18--29 years of age.28 The once and very temporarily
vaunted Beijing Consensus, a system that marries market mechanisms to
authoritarian political control, remains a mirage. The Communist Party
might yet develop a form of governance that is universally attractive,
but for now, China finds itself at a distinct disadvantage in the battle
of political ideas.

#### No escalation or draw-in

**Taylor, 14** \-- Head of the Strategic and Defense Studies Center --
Australian National University (Spring, Brendan, "The South China Sea is
Not a Flashpoint",
<https://twq.elliott.gwu.edu/sites/twq.elliott.gwu.edu/files/downloads/Taylor_PDF.pdf>)

**[History]{.underline}** initially **[suggests]{.underline}** that
**[the [S]{.mark}]{.underline}**outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea **[is [not a
flashpoint]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The [loss of life resulting
from]{.underline} the [use of force there pales in comparison
to]{.underline} those in [East Asia's traditional
flashpoints]{.underline}. For instance, in the unresolved Korean War
(1950--53), which remains at the heart of continuing tensions on the
Korean Peninsula, an estimated two million military personnel were
either killed or unaccounted for.7 A comparable number of casualties
occurred in the Chinese Civil War (1946--1949), which left today's
Taiwan flashpoint as a direct product.8 Further, at a time when some
analysts are talking up the prospects of war between China and Japan
over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, it is worth recalling that an estimated
15--35 million perished during the course of the second Sino--Japanese
War (1937--45).9

While history is not destiny, more recent estimates suggest that the
combustion of any one of these flashpoints today could prove equally
devastating. Richard Bush and Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings
Institution, for example, predict that a conflict over Taiwan could
spark a nuclear war involving 1.5 billion people and produce a
fundamental change in the international order.10 Similar estimates
produced at the time of the 1993--94 North Korean nuclear crisis
suggested that war on the Korean Peninsula could cost half a million
lives and up to US\$1 trillion in its first ninety days.11 Conflict
between Asia's two most powerful navies in the East China Sea could
prove equally devastating, particularly given that China and Japan are
also the world's second- and third-largest economies, respectively.
Total trade between these two historical great powers of East Asia
currently stands at U.S. \$345 billion.12

[[It is **hard to envisage a credible scenario** where a
skirmish]{.mark} in the **S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina
**[S]{.underline}**ea [[could erupt]{.mark} into a conflict of similar
proportions]{.underline}. [The [nationalist foundations of these
disputes are **fundamentally different**]{.mark} from those underpinning
East Asia's traditional flashpoints]{.underline}. By way of example,
recent polling suggests that 87 percent of the Chinese public view Japan
negatively, whilst 50 percent anticipate a military dispute with
Japan.13 Reflecting this sentiment, when Tokyo announced its decision to
purchase contested Islands in the East China Sea from their private
owner in September 2012, this sparked widespread anti-Japanese protests
across China that spread to more than 100 cities.14 Such [public
displays of nationalist sentiment stand in marked contrast to June 2013
anti-China protests in Hanoi following]{.underline} Vietnamese
[allegations that a Chinese vessel had rammed and damaged a Vietnamese
fishing boat]{.underline}. Subsequently, [a **mere 150 protesters**
gathered in the city center]{.underline}.15 [Crowds of comparable size
have attended anti-Chinese protests in the Philippines]{.underline}. For
instance, a March 2012 protest outside the Chinese Embassy in Manila
that organizers expected to draw 1,000 protesters attracted barely half
that number.16

The [[strategic geography]{.underline}]{.mark} of the South China Sea
[[also **militates against it being a genuine
flashpoint**]{.underline}.]{.mark} [Throughout history, [large bodies of
water have tended to inhibit]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[**[willingness]{.mark}** and **ability** of adversaries to wage
war]{.underline}. In The Tragedy of Great Power Politics, for instance,
John Mearsheimer refers to "the stopping power of water," writing of the
limits that large bodies of water place on the capacity of states to
project military power---relative, at least, to when they share common
land borders.17 [Even when clashes]{.underline} at sea [do
occur]{.underline}, [history suggests]{.underline} that [these generally
afford statesmen **[greater time and space to find diplomatic
solution]{.mark}s**]{.underline}. As Robert Ross observes, in such cases
"[neither side has to fear that]{.underline} the other's [provocative
diplomacy or movement of troops is a prelude to attack]{.underline} and
immediately escalate to heightened military readiness. [[Tension can be
**slower to develop**]{.mark}, allowing]{.underline} the protagonists
[time to **manage** and **avoid** unnecessary
escalation]{.underline}."18

[Ross' observation]{.underline}, in turn, [dovetails]{.underline}
elegantly [with the issue of proximity]{.underline}, which Hoyt regards
as a defining feature of a flashpoint. [The antagonists in the
**S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea
disputes [are **less proximate**]{.underline} than in the case of the
Korean Peninsula---where the two Koreas share a land border that remains
the most militarized on earth. The same can be said of the Taiwan
flashpoint. Indeed, the proximity of Taiwan to the mainland affords
Beijing [credible strategic options]{.underline}--- [and]{.underline}
arguably even [incentives]{.underline}---[involving]{.underline} the
[use of force]{.underline} that [are **not available**]{.underline} to
it [in the **S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina
**[S]{.underline}**ea.19

Finally, and related to the third of Hoyt's criteria, [the
**S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea
**[cannot be said to engage the vital interests of Asia's great
powers]{.underline}**. To be sure, much has been made of India's growing
interests in this part of the world--- particularly following reports of
a July 2011 face-off between a Chinese ship and an Indian naval vessel
that was leaving Vietnamese waters.20 However, [New Delhi's
interests]{.underline} in the South China Sea [remain overwhelmingly
economic, not strategic, driven]{.underline} as they are by the search
for oil. Moreover, even if New Delhi had anything more than secondary
strategic interests at stake in the geographically distant South China
Sea, it is widely accepted that India's armed forces will for some time
lack the capacity to credibly defend these.21 Similarly, while much has
been made of Tokyo's willingness to assist Manila with improving its
maritime surveillance capabilities,22 for reasons of history and
geography, [Tokyo's interests in the Senkaku]{.underline}/Diaoyu
[Islands]{.underline} dispute, the [Korean Peninsula, and]{.underline}
even the [Taiwan]{.underline} flashpoint **[dwarf those]{.underline}**
which **[it has at stake in the]{.underline}** more **[distant
S]{.underline}**outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea. [The
extent to which this body of water]{.underline} genuinely
[engages]{.underline} the [vital interests of China and the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[continues to be
overstated]{.underline}**.

As Japan and China recognize the altered dynamics around the Pacific
Rim, some observers believe that they may inch toward a possible
reconciliation. Such a [Sino-Japanese]{.underline} **[rapprochement is
unlikely]{.underline}**, however, [given their]{.underline}
**[long-standing historical enmity.]{.underline}** [Negative
attitudes]{.underline} **[toward Japan]{.underline}** [are]{.underline}
**[widespread among main- land Chinese]{.underline}**. According to a
recent Pew survey, [less than **10% of Chinese** think that
Japan]{.underline} **[can be trusted]{.underline}**---[and the feeling
is]{.underline} **[mutual]{.underline}**. [Young Chinese]{.underline},
who did not personally experience the war, [express]{.underline}
**[surprisingly vehement anti-Japanese
feelings]{.underline}**---[sentiments that are due in no small part to
state propaganda and patri- otic education]{.underline} in schools that
**[make criticism of Japan politically correct]{.underline}**.92
Moreover, the [Chinese see themselves as the **natural
hegemon**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} in their--- worldview, **[the

[Chinese elites]{.underline} **[refuse to accept Japan's legitimacy as a

his successors will]{.underline} **[tolerate such a future for
Japan,]{.underline}** which is why Japan is offering maritime and
development assistance to countries like Vietnam and the Philippines.
Ultimately, however, China's rise and America's retreat to a more
offshore posture will force into existence a military alliance between
Japan and India (and, perhaps, Russia as well) to restore a regional
balance of power to counter growing Chinese power.
