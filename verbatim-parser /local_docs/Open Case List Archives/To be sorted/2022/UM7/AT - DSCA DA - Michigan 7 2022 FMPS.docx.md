#### The DOD has more than enough resources, Congress just massively increased the budget and earmarked funding for Ukraine and other priorities

[The Senate Armed Services Committee has endorsed a \$45 billion
increase to President Joe Biden's military spending plans]{.underline}
in its annual defense policy bill, blowing past the administration's
Pentagon budget for a second straight year.

The rebuke of Biden's budget plans, which occurred during the panel's
closed-door markup of the National Defense Authorization Act this week,
comes after [lawmakers added roughly \$30 billion to the White House's
previous defense spending proposal.]{.underline}

[This week's boost brings the bill's topline budget figure to \$847
billion, according to Armed Services Chair Jack Reed
(D-R.I.)]{.underline}. [The goal, he said, is to]{.underline} counteract
runaway inflation, [aid Ukraine, replenish weapons sent into the fight
against Russia, and fund military priorities]{.underline} left out of
the Pentagon budget request.          

### AT: Russia Strong

#### Russia's military is weak -- Ukraine proves

**Freedman 7/5** \[Lawrence Freedman (An emeritus professor of war
studies at King\'s College London.), 7-5-2022, \"Can Ukraine win the
war?,\" New Statesman,
<https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/ukraine/2022/07/can-ukraine-win-war-with-russia>\]
// st

In this second stage of the war, [Russian]{.underline} forces have not
been able to rely so much on manoeuvrability because of [armoured
vehicle losses. They have sought to make up for their losses with
vehicles from the reserves]{.underline}, including, as widely reported,
vintage tanks [that were in use in the 1960s. New tank production may
have ground to a halt because of the lack of key components, such as
microchips,]{.underline} [which have been]{.underline} sourced from the
West and are now [sanctioned.]{.underline}¶ [Russia]{.underline} also
seems to be [running low on stocks of precision weapons, evident in some
of their recent long-range strikes]{.underline}. It is likely, for
example, that it did not intend the deadly attack on the shopping mall
in Kremenchuk, and instead had a nearby target in mind, which it also
failed to destroy. This demonstrated, in addition to the inaccuracy of
its weapons, the general Russian carelessness when it comes to
collateral damage and their inability to take responsibility for
mistakes (as always, suggesting that for some reason the Ukrainians did
this to themselves). Coming as the G7 was meeting, it helped to boost
support for Ukraine, reminding the leaders about why it is important
that Russia fails.¶ [Their response to past troop losses has been to
scramble around to find more troops where they can.]{.underline} One
option for Putin would be to announce a general mobilisation but he has
been reluctant to do that because he knows how unpopular such a move
would be. There are indications of shortfalls in the current call-up of
conscripts, even though they are not supposed to be sent to the front.
Instead, the [aim is to encourage conscripts, and anyone with military
experience, to contract into the military, often for financial
reward.]{.underline} There is [anecdotal evidence that many of those who
have been in the thick of the fighting have been looking for ways to get
out of their contrac]{.underline}ts.¶ [According to the military analyst
Michael Kofman, Russian commanders are increasingly reliant on
front-line fighting forces]{.underline} from the enclaves in Donbas,
mercenaries from the Wagner Group, volunteers and reserve battalions
manned by recently contracted servicemen. The fighting for Severodonetsk
was largely undertaken by units from Luhansk, who appear to have
suffered terribly in the process, and may now appreciate that they are
being used as cannon fodder by the Russians. Kofman suggests that other
units are being used for offensive manoeuvres, with the most capable
being moved "around the battlefield to attempt localized advances".

#### The war in Ukraine is draining Russia's military power. Russia won't be at pre-war military capacity for several years

Open-source tracking from blogs such as Oryx reveals that [Russia has
lost a considerable amount of equipment to date in its invasion,
including more than 800 tanks and almost 500 armored fighting
vehicles]{.underline} at the time of writing.¶ Besides the losses
Russian forces have taken[, the ammunition expended by Russian forces is
considerable and will take some time to replenish. According to
Ukrainian sources, Russia is firing 60,000 artillery shells per day in
Ukraine, a rate that would be taxing on the defense industrial base on
any country that has not mobilized its economy for wartime production,
which Russia has so far refused to do.]{.underline}¶ [Russia's arsenal
of precision-guided munitions]{.underline} also appears to have been
[significantly depleted over the course of the invasion, limiting
Moscow's ability to strike certain military or transportation targets,
especially those that are mobile]{.underline}. For years, Russian
military doctrine has held that precision-guided munitions are a key
tool alongside more conventional, unguided munitions.¶ The Russian
Military: What Happens Next?¶ [To recoup its materiel losses in Ukraine,
the Russian military will need several years of serial production of
everything from armor to munitions to reach pre-war reserve
levels.]{.underline}¶ According to [Pavel Luzin, an expert on Russian
military affairs, organizational issues in Russia's defense production
base and disruptions to Russian defense supply chains as a result of
sanctions placed on Russia]{.underline} following its 2022 invasion
[mean that it will likely take a minimum of four years for Russia's
armed forces to rebuild its arsenal of armored vehicles to January 2022
levels.]{.underline}¶ [Reserves of precision-guided munitions will take
even longer to reach prior levels as a result of similar pressures --
Luzin estimates that it would take at least ten years for such stocks to
be replenished.]{.underline}

### AT: Food Prices Impact

**No impact to food insecurity**

**Vestby 18** \[Jonas Vestby (Senior Researcher at the Peace Research
Institute Oslo (PRIO). His research focuses on the link between
environmental change and violent conflict, including forecasting models

consideration.), 5-18-2018, \"Does hunger cause conflict? -- Climate and
Conflict,\"
<https://blogs.prio.org/ClimateAndConflict/2018/05/does-hunger-cause-conflict/>\]
// st

It is perhaps surprising, then, that there is [little scholarly merit in
the notion that a short-term reduction in access to food increases the
probability that conflict will break out.]{.underline} This is because
[to start or participate in violent conflict requires people to have
both the means and the will. Most people on the brink of starvation are
not in the position to resort to violence]{.underline}, whether against
the government or other social groups. In fact, the urban middle classes
tend to be the most likely to protest against rises in food prices,
since they often have the best opportunities, the most energy, and the
best skills to coordinate and participate in protests.¶ Accordingly,
there is a [widespread misapprehension that social unrest in periods of
high food prices relates primarily to food shortages. In reality, the
sources of discontent are considerably more complex -- linked to
political structures, land ownership, corruption, the desire for
democratic reforms and general economic problems -- where the price of
food is seen in the context of general increases in the cost of
living.]{.underline} Research has shown that while the international
media have a tendency to seek simple resource-related explanations --
such as drought or famine -- for conflicts in the Global South, debates
in the local media are permeated by more complex political
relationships.

#### Russia doesn't have the resources to take NATO head on -- risk for conflict is low 

**Culp 7/6** \[Wesley Culp (A Research Fellow at the Center for the
Study of the Presidency and Congress. He regularly writes on Russian and

// st

In the short-term, [the risk of direct confrontation between the Russian
military and NATO is low]{.underline}, save for accidental escalation,
in large part due to the fact that the Russian armed forces are so
thoroughly committed to the so-called "special military operation."¶
Instead of being increasingly concentrated on Russia's border with
Norway and Finland following Finland's official decision to apply for
NATO membership, Russian forces in the area actually appear to be
increasingly taking part in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.¶ [Even
before Moscow's invasion, Western military analysts had good reason to
be skeptical of Russia's ability to conduct massive military operations
outside the confines of the former Soviet Union.]{.underline}¶ [In its
existing state, the Russian military are highly dependent on rail links
to ensure that its armed forces are properly supplied.]{.underline}
Given the fact that only former Soviet countries and Finland use the
same rail gauge as Russia, [any sustainment operation of Russian forces
outside the former Soviet Union would face significant logistical
hurdles.]{.underline}¶ Russian Military Will Learn from Ukraine War
Mistakes ¶ While some of the baked-in [weaknesses of the Russian
military]{.underline} model have been [exposed by]{.underline} its
invasion of [Ukraine]{.underline}, the U.S. and NATO still have good
reason to take competition from Russia as well as the prospect that
Russia will learn from its mistakes seriously.¶ For example, while the
Deputy Commander of the Estonian Defense Forces has claimed that [Russia
is likely too weak to put pressure on or seize the strategic Suwałki
Gap]{.underline} (a source of some anxiety given ongoing drama
surrounding Lithuania's enforcement of EU sanctions on overland
transport of certain Russian goods to the Russian exclave of
Kaliningrad), he also cautioned that Russia is no stranger to learning
from its mistakes and adapting.

### AT: Reclaiming Territory

#### Putin won't attempt to rebuild the Soviet Union -- oligarchs, desire, NATO membership, and military capabilities prevent expansion

**Stanton 5/16** \[Andrew Stanton (A Staff Writer for Newsweek and
Boston Globe Metro Correspondent with a graduate degree in journalism
from Emerson College), 5-16-2022, \"Putin allies\' wealth will keep him

// st

[Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s reliance on oligarchs could prevent
him from reviving the Soviet Union]{.underline}, experts said.¶
Following Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine, some raised concerns that Putin
could be seeking to revive the Soviet Union. But a return to
Soviet-style economics could threaten the wealth of his allies in
Russia\'s oligarchical class, so it\'s unlikely he would seize their
assets, Bryon Moraski, a professor of Russian politics at the University
of Florida explained to Newsweek.¶ [Putin relies on both popular and
elite support for legitimacy]{.underline}, Moraski explained. [This
means that any efforts to seize the assets of Russian oligarchs could
cause him to lose the support of his closest allies, potentially leaving
him in a difficult position as the president.]{.underline}¶ \"There
wouldn\'t be an ideological reason for Putin to go through some kind of
process for the redistribution of property,\" Moraski said.¶ Brian
Taylor, a professor of Russian politics at Syracuse University, offered
a slightly different view, saying that Russian oligarchs would have
little recourse if Putin were to seize their assets---though he agreed
it remains unlikely he would reconstruct the Soviet Union.¶ \"If Putin
decides that it has to be nationalized, the legal system is not going to
stop him from doing that,\" he told Newsweek.¶ Moraski, however, said
that even if Putin tried to seize oligarchs\' wealth, much of it rests
offshore, so he would have a difficult time obtaining it.¶ Taylor
explained how [Putin trying to bring back the USSR in geographic terms
would harm the wealth of Russian oligarchs.]{.underline}¶ [Putin
attempting to retake some of the former Soviet Republics would cause
these oligarchs to take on additional sanctions---in addition to those
already imposed amid the Ukraine invasion.]{.underline}¶ [The oligarchs
would also likely have to take companies seized by Russia during the
war, but this would not be a \"welcome gift,\" as they would need to
invest money into these businesses that would have been ravaged by
war]{.underline}, Taylor said.¶ \"Who are they going to ship the product
to? Because it\'s not from a legally recognized part of Russia so it
would be immediately sanctioned by everyone,\" he said.¶ Both Moraski
and Taylor agreed [there are other reasons Putin remains unlikely to
revive the Soviet Union---including that the president has no
ideological desire to do so, as the current political system in Russia
is more pragmatic or \"personalist,\" rather than having the same
communist or Marxist ideology as the former Soviet Union.]{.underline}¶
[The Russian military\'s mounting setbacks in Ukraine mean it would be
difficult to invade other former Soviet republics, some of which
(Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) are \"off the table\" because they are
now members of the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO)]{.underline}, Taylor said. Any attack on these
countries would spark a strong Western response.¶ [\"I don\'t actually
think he has any particular interest in some of the other republics of
the former Soviet Union, as opposed to keeping them in the Russian
sphere of influence,\" he added. \"I don\'t think he wants to annex
Tajikistan or Armenia or something like that.\"]{.underline}

// st

In war, miscalculations can lead to disaster. Mr. [Putin]{.underline}
and his military leaders both [overestimated their forces' capabilities
and severely underestimated the strength of the Ukrainian resistance.
The Russian army has thus far been plagued by poor logistical
operations, careless tactics and significant difficulty in executing a
multi-front invasion. Likewise, the Russians have not yet gained air
superiority over Ukraine despite having a substantial advantage in
airpower. Although the Russians have made advances]{.underline},
particularly in the south[, their progress has been sluggish, and the
fighting has exposed severe vulnerabilities in Russia's military
strategy and tactics]{.underline}. Conversely, the Ukrainians, armed
with Western weapons and fighting fiercely to defend their homeland,
have put up a stiff resistance that has exacted a steep price from
Russian troops.¶ Furthermore, it seems that Mr. [Putin]{.underline} did
not expect and was [not prepared for the]{.underline} robust
[international response]{.underline} to his invasion. This may [drive
him further into]{.underline} his [paranoiac isolation]{.underline}. The
[sanctions against Russia]{.underline}'s economy are some of the
harshest ever imposed on a country of its size, threatening to
[devastate an economy that is highly dependent on the export of natural
resources, especially oil and gas.]{.underline}¶ [This puts Mr. Putin in
a dangerous position, as his isolation from even his closest advisers
could lead him to escalate the conflict and make further ill-considered
decisions.]{.underline} Just last week, Mr. Putin had one of the top
generals of his invading units arrested for allegedly leaking
intelligence and squandering fuel. If his invasion continues to
encounter setbacks and higher-than-expected casualties, Mr. Putin's
paranoia could lead him to further miscalculations. [What was supposed
to be a prime opportunity for Russia to reassert its dominance over a
former Soviet territory has instead revealed its weakness.]{.underline}¶
Mr. [Putin]{.underline} is more than just a paranoid ruler backed into a
corner. He is an evil dictator obsessed with power and has been for a
long time. But will Mr. Putin isolate himself further and allow his
[paranoia]{.underline} to fuel greater mistakes? In the Poe story, the
reclusive Usher's growing suspicion [steers him into catastrophic
mistakes that end in tragedy and]{.underline} the [collapse]{.underline}
of the house. [Mr. Putin would be foolish to let his obsession to
reunite the Soviet Union drive him to double down on his errors and
insist on a decisive military victory in Ukraine.]{.underline} Instead,
he should cut his losses and call off the invasion to bring an end to
this destructive and needless war.

Russia's threatening nuclear rhetoric in its war on Ukraine is dangerous
and irresponsible. The Kremlin sees nuclear threats as an all-purpose
response to setbacks[. NATO is not a threat to Russia and does not seek
confrontation with Russia. The Alliance's actions are defensive and a
response to Russia's aggression. So there is no reason for Russia to
increase the readiness of its nuclear forces. Any use of nuclear weapons
by Russia would fundamentally change the nature of the conflict, and it
would have unprecedented consequences for Russia.]{.underline} Russia
must understand that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be
fought.¶ The Russian foreign ministry's [claims about a]{.underline}
Ukrainian [biological weapons programme are baseless and
absurd.]{.underline} Russia is once again inventing false pretexts in an
attempt to justify its invasion of Ukraine. NATO will continue to call
out Russia's disinformation and lies for the world to see. [Any use by

### AT: DIB

#### The DIB is in the dumps

**Tegler 22**, 2-4-2022, Eric Tegler is a Contributor for Forbes in
[AEROSPACE & DEFENSE](https://www.forbes.com/aerospace-defense/)\"The
Defense Industrial Base's Vital Signs Aren't Looking Good,\"
https://www.forbes.com/sites/erictegler/2022/02/04/the-defense-industrial-bases-vital-signs-arent-looking-good/?sh=215e90c02101

For the last three years, [the [National Defense Industrial
Association](https://www.ndia.org/) has issued an annual report on the
health of America's Defense Industrial Base]{.underline}. While the
state of the U.S. defense industry has been a source of angst for
decades, the NDIA's latest report is the first to assess the environment
in which its members operate as broadly failing.

[The study, [Vital Signs 2022](https://www.ndia.org/policy/vital-signs),
found deteriorating conditions for the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) in
eight categories, including industrial security, supply chains,
productive capacity and surge readiness]{.underline}.

Wes Hallman, NDIA's senior vice president of strategy and policy, says
that this year's study depicted a broadly negative environment in part
because it uses lagging publicly available data. Though compiled in
2021, it uses 2020 data (SEC Form 10-K public filings, public contract
data, government indicators including contract failure rates) which
finally became available in the first quarter of 2021. It will similarly
use the 2021 data it receives this March for next year's report.

[The study does include a survey conducted in summer 2021 of NDIA's
members, large and small, with over 400 respondents. That more
up-to-date survey illustrates a situation that is not improving,
exacerbated by inflationary pressure and congressional gridlock on the
defense budget]{.underline}.

"[As you look at our previous reports, you see areas of fragility and
concern," Hallman notes. "Covid really shined a spotlight on those
concerns whether they're workforce challenges, supply chain,
etc]{.underline}."

NDIA's researchers say they expect they'll get similar responses to
their survey questions this coming year, [which should raise alarm bells
adding to those that have been sounding for years]{.underline}. The NDIA
asked members if they thought their 2022 performance would match their
2021 business. Fourteen percent said they thought they would not perform
as well.

NDIA's regulatory policy associate Robert Van Steenburg, adds that one
survey response pointedly stood out.

"We asked our members, 'Are you the sole eligible supplier for the good
or service you provide? Thirty percent of them said yes."

Altogether, the public data and survey responses in the report yielded
five key takeaways, the first centering on the effects of the pandemic.
Not surprisingly, 71% of respondents reported "moderate negative" or
"large negative" impacts due to Covid-19. This was reflected in a cash
conversion cycle that fell by 38 points in 2020 according to NDIA
scoring.

[The data lag]{.underline} in the report may not fully reflect the
impact of massive government expenditures for Covid relief. Total relief
spending by the U.S. on the pandemic is over \$6 trillion, or roughly
27.1% of the nation\'s GDP, the third-highest globally, according to
data published by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

The defense contractors which constitute NDIA membership were declared
"essential" early in the pandemic and thus never stopped working during
initial lockdowns. Nevertheless, [many of these companies had exposure
to the broader economic activity halt through complimentary commercial
business lines in aerospace, airlines and elsewhere]{.underline}. More
pure defense contractors with less exposure appeared to do better but
still suffered productivity losses.

[Those have continued despite the torrent of spending thanks in part to
federal measures - or the threat of federal measures - related to
vaccine mandates]{.underline}.

"[There is a portion of the \[DIB\] workforce that is reticent about
vaccines]{.underline}," Hallman affirms. "[Even where companies are 90%
vaccinated, there are key personnel that are hard to replace which has
caused some lines to shut down, some contracts to go into
failure.]{.underline}" He adds that NDIA continues to communicate this
reality to policy makers "so there is an understanding that these
policies have real impact on the defense industrial base".

Workforce issues continue to be a challenge, the pandemic
notwithstanding. In the report, [67% respondents said it was "somewhat
difficult" or "extremely difficult" to find cleared workers. There were
similar results for skilled trade workers, and STEM
workers]{.underline}. A security clearance backlog that reached
approximately 700,000 individuals a few years ago has improved, but
Hallman says that progress appears to have stagnated.

Nick Jones, NDIA's regulatory policy director, says contractors view
this as a critical systemic problem beside [lower workforce
participation across the economy]{.underline}.

"Our membership was asked what part of your supply chain is most
vulnerable? [The most frequent response was the gap in U.S.-based human
capital. It's really the workforce that is increasingly the limiting
factor for many of these companies. There's an aspect of Covid in this
but it's been ongoing and is really tangential to the Covid
crisis."]{.underline}

[The prospects for innovation in the DIB scored negatively as
well]{.underline}. The study reported a drop in the number of new
entrants in the sector from 6,500 in FY19 to 6,300 in FY20. That trend
looks set to continue, a reality reflected in a series of public
discussions by policy makers, participants and the Pentagon over the
last year.

"There should have been a lot more new entrants into the contractor
ranks whether through Covid-related Defense Production Act contracts or
through companies in the commercial sector looking for a safe haven,"
Wes Hallman asserts. "[The fact that the number didn't go up but down
despite Covid \[contracting/spending\] is an interesting
statistic."]{.underline}

[The oft cited problem of the so-called "Valley of Death" wherein
innovative, small defense companies go out of business in the gap
between receiving R&D funding and getting an actual contract in a
program of record may get worse]{.underline} Hallman points out.

"[The latest version of the National Defense Authorization Act \[NDAA\]
did not extend the SBIR \[Small Business Innovation Research\]
authority]{.underline}. The program sunsets on the 1st of October of
this year. [That's a bad signal]{.underline}."
