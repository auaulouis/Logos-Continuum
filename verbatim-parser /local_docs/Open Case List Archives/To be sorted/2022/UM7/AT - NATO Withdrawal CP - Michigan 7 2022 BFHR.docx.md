It is February 2021. A few months after his re-election as president of
the United States, Donald Trump [declare]{.underline}s that
[NATO]{.underline} has become [**obsolete** and the]{.underline}
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[**[withdraw]{.mark}s** [from]{.mark} the
**[alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [All U.S. forces]{.underline} ---
military personnel and equipment --- including nuclear and missile
defense assets [will be withdrawn from Europe [a]{.mark}s soon as
possible]{.underline}.

[This **[nightmare scenario]{.mark}** has been on the mind of
many]{.underline} security policy officials, and experts, ever since the
New York Times reported in January 2019 that Trump discussed several
times over the course of 2018 wanting to withdraw from the alliance.
Congress has acted and passed the NATO Support Act, which prohibits the
use of funds to withdraw the United States from the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization. Yet the possibility of such a move cannot entirely
be excluded.

Trump's musings about a NATO withdrawal have served as a wake-up call
for some in Europe that Europeans urgently need to assume greater
responsibility for their own security. This realization is one of the
reasons why closer defense cooperation and a greater degree of strategic
autonomy are high on the European Union's agenda. But are Europeans able
to defend themselves? How would they think about their defense without
the United States?

A [**[policy game]{.mark}** prepared by Körber-Stiftung and the
International Institute for Strategic Studies]{.underline} sought to
[answer]{.underline} these [questions]{.underline} this summer in
Berlin. Five country teams with [experts from France]{.underline},
[Germany]{.underline}, [Poland]{.underline}, the [U]{.underline}nited
[K]{.underline}ingdom, [and the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [[addressed]{.mark} a [fictional scenario]{.mark}
[that involved]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[U.S.]{.mark} [withdrawal from
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}, followed by crises in a NATO member state in
the western Balkans and across Eastern Europe. How would Europeans react
to such a scenario? What are the red lines, interests, and priorities of
the respective actors? How might Europeans organize their defense if the
United States withdraws from NATO, and what role could the United States
play in European security after the withdrawal?

The [[results]{.mark} of the game were
**[sobering]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [with **no clear upside** for any of
the participating teams]{.underline}. While a one-time simulation
exercise, it provided valuable insights into the interests and
preferences of European member states.

[At the beginning]{.underline} of the policy game, most
[[Europe]{.mark}an teams [adopt]{.mark}ed a]{.underline}
"**[[wait-and-see]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[approach]{.mark} focused on
persuading the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to **return**
to NATO]{.underline}, offering concessions that were unthinkable before
(from trade to energy). The unfortunate message for transatlantic
relations seems to be that a threat to abandon NATO might actually yield
some results.

[Europeans started to [take proactive]{.mark}
[steps]{.mark}]{.underline} only [[once]{.mark} the security
situation]{.underline} in the scenario **[deteriorated
significantly]{.underline}**, [and when [it became]{.mark}
[clear]{.mark} that]{.underline} the [[U.S.
withdrawal]{.underline}]{.mark} decision --- at least in this simulation
--- [was **[irreversible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Faced with a crisis in
a NATO member state in the **western Balkans**]{.underline} (in the
scenario, a pro-Russian coup d'état with Russian warships blocking
access to the Mediterranean Sea), most teams anticipated that remaining
NATO members would struggle to agree to invoke the principle of
collective defense under Article 5 in this grey-zone scenario. Instead,
the invocation of Article 4 --- which involves only consultations in
case the security or independence of a NATO member state is threatened
--- paired with sanctions on Russia and a robust response within ad-hoc
coalitions were the preferred means of action. [[Without]{.mark}
**[U.S.]{.mark} security guarantees**]{.underline}, it seems, the
[[**credibility** of **Article 5**]{.mark} and the **mutual defense
commitment** are **[questionable]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

And **[then it got worse]{.underline}**: [In case of an escalation in
the east]{.underline} (an incident akin to the Cuban missile crisis,
involving an extended-range version of the SSC-8 Screwdriver land attack
cruise missile with a range in excess of 4,500 km stationed in western
Russia), [European shortfalls]{.underline} especially in air and missile
defense were [identified as an **existential risk** for European
countries **without nuclear capabilities**]{.underline} after the United
States has withdrawn all nuclear and missile defense assets in the
scenario. Given that filling these gaps would require long-term
investment, [Europe would likely remain vulnerable for
**years**]{.underline} to come in such a scenario.

Especially [for Germany]{.underline}, [a [U.S.]{.mark}
[withdrawal]{.mark} from NATO would [represent]{.mark} an **[existential
security threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The German team suggested
exploring the possibilities of the Franco-German Aachen Treaty of 2019
and asking France and the United Kingdom to expand their nuclear
umbrellas to other European countries. [[Developing]{.underline}]{.mark}
a [[German]{.mark} nuclear weapons [capacity]{.mark}]{.underline} was
considered an **[[unlikely option]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[due to
**domestic**]{.mark} **[opposition]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Yet,
[[expanding]{.underline}]{.mark} the [British and French
[nuc]{.mark}lear [umbrella]{.mark}]{.underline} would [[come at]{.mark}
a **[significant cost]{.mark}**]{.underline}: The
**[burden]{.underline}**-[**sharing debate** would **return** to
Europe]{.underline}. Nuclear deterrence will remain the Gretchenfrage of
European security, and [[if]{.mark} expanding]{.underline} the British
and French [nuclear umbrella [fails]{.mark}]{.underline}, some [teams
[anticipate]{.mark}d]{.underline} a
**[[prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration [[of]{.mark} [nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} [in Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}.

When it comes to institutional frameworks, from a French perspective,
[NATO would be dead without the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates: The French team preferred a new, E.U.-centered
collective defense structure in the long term, with other actors
affiliating on a bilateral basis. This position was met with skepticism
especially from the British and Polish side; Germany, Poland, and the
United Kingdom were adamant that the NATO command structure should be
maintained after a U.S. withdrawal and provide possibilities for the
United States to "opt in" to any future security structure.

A post-Brexit United Kingdom, as envisioned in the scenario, would
consider itself a leading actor in European security, willing and
capable of shaping Europe's future security architecture. Given its
significant defense capabilities, the U.K. team saw its country in a
powerful negotiating position and was skeptical of French and German
leadership on defense issues. British red lines were the following: No
E.U. army, no E.U. alliance or, as they said, the United Kingdom wants
to design European security, not just sign on a dotted line.

As the representative for NATO's most vulnerable-feeling eastern member
states, the Polish team did not trust Europe's ability to organize
collective defense and was tempted to conclude bilateral deals with the
United States. As the Polish team said, if the United States withdraws,
the eastern flank should be the last place. A "bilateralization" of
security and defense with the United States, including bilateral
security guarantees, is the likely consequence. Interestingly, all teams
rejected Russian overtures for conflict resolution in exchange for
concessions on security, such as drafting a European security treaty
based on Medvedev's 2008 proposals. This demonstrates that Russia was
not considered a credible security provider in Europe, despite
suspicions that Germany might be tempted to engage in a dialogue with
Russia on this.

For the U.S. team, subsidizing European security was no longer an
option. The team felt that Europeans should put everything on the table
for security guarantees, from trade to policy alignment on Iran and
China. The U.S. team argued that countries that care will find a way to
keep the United States engaged, and that Europe should take the lead in
crisis management on the continent. In this scenario, a transactional
relationship seems to be the new normal in U.S.-European relations, yet
Europeans were disillusioned as they hoped for a continuous strategic
U.S. interest in Europe and a values-based partnership. In contrast, the
U.S. team in the game focused primarily on a fair deal addressing both
defense and trade issues.

Thinking about the broader implications of the policy game, it becomes
[clear that [without]{.mark} [U.S.]{.mark} security
[guarantees]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [principles of [European
unity]{.mark}]{.underline} and mutual solidarity [were
**[quickly]{.mark} [challenged]{.mark}** and Europe]{.underline} was [at
**serious risk** of **splitting** into different camps]{.underline}.
While Europeans were in principle willing to organize their own defense,
the [[shortfalls]{.mark} in military capabilities [precluded]{.mark}
[meaningful action]{.mark} and [led to]{.mark} a [**quick emergence** of
**divisions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This could also occur under
conditions short of U.S. withdrawal, such as a reduction in its European
force posture or its willingness to engage. [**Any degree of reduced
U.S. commitment** would thus **exacerbate European
divisions**]{.underline}.

Moreover, [a [German nuclear]{.mark} [arsenal would]{.mark} risk
**[bring]{.mark}ing [down the]{.mark} international
[nonprolif]{.mark}eration [regime]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Before
acquiring the bomb, [[Germany would have to leave the]{.mark} Nuclear
[Nonprolif]{.mark}eration [Treaty]{.mark}, [a move that would
**threaten**]{.mark} **the continued [existence of the treaty]{.mark}
itself**. Despite the NPT's successful record, [the treaty]{.mark}\'s
future **[already looks]{.mark} [uncertain]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Under
the NPT, [[states with nuclear weapons agreed to pursue
disarmament]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} in recent years, [progress]{.mark}
toward this goal [has **stalled**, and nonnuclear states have]{.mark}
**increasingly [voiced their frustration]{.mark}** that the nuclear
weapons states have not fulfilled their promise. A [**foundational
goal** of the treaty]{.mark}]{.underline}, moreover, [[was to **keep
Germany**]{.mark} **[from building nuclear weapons]{.mark}**. [If Berlin
**defected**, the]{.mark} nonproliferation [regime]{.mark} might
**[collapse]{.mark} entirely**]{.underline}, because other countries
would no longer feel bound by the treaty\'s collective bargain.

Germany would also need to modify or withdraw from the so-called Two
Plus Four Treaty, the agreement on reunification that East and West
Germany signed with France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and
the United States in 1990. In that document, Germany affirmed its
\"renunciation of the manufacture and possession of and control over
nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.\" The treaty was meant not
only to end the Cold War but also to prevent any future German
Sonderweg; abrogating it would bring back the German question and
deliver an affront to the four countries that paid such enormous costs
to defeat Nazi Germany in World War II.

Worst of all, [the [pursuit of]{.mark} a [German nuclear
arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} rather than deterring aggression,
[could **[increase]{.mark} the risk of [conflict in Europe]{.mark}**,
since [Russia would]{.mark} likely [work to **prevent Germany from
acquiring the bomb**]{.mark}. Moscow could assassinate German nuclear
scientists, use cyberattacks]{.underline} to sabotage German nuclear
industrial infrastructure, [and perhaps]{.underline} go so far as to
[strike German nuclear facilities from the air. Even covert operations
could **quickly spiral into outright confrontation**]{.underline}.

Even if Germany managed to acquire nuclear weapons, it would then face
the daunting task of making sure they could survive a Russian attack. In
recent years, Russia has moved its missiles westward, targeting Germany
and other nato members. Now that Russia has allegedly deployed multiple
cruise missiles in violation of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces Treaty, under which the Soviet Union and the United States agreed
to abandon midrange missiles, its ability to destroy a fledgling German
nuclear stockpile is only growing. Unless Germany managed to conceal and
protect its nuclear weapons almost immediately, [[German leaders]{.mark}
could]{.underline}, during a crisis with Russia, [feel pressure to
**[launch a preemptive nuclear attack]{.mark}** against Russia in order
to avoid losing the arsenal to a Russian first strike]{.underline}.

These formidable barriers to a German nuclear program have led some to
return to the idea of a British-French deterrent. But the United
Kingdom\'s impending departure from the eu leaves Germany with the sole
option of reaching out to France. This would not be the first time that
France and Germany have considered a joint European nuclear deterrent.
In 1957, shortly after the Suez crisis, when tensions between France and
the United States were running high and the French government began to
doubt the credibility of the U.S. nuclear guarantee, France suggested to
Italy and West Germany that the three countries develop nuclear weapons
together. The next year, French President Charles de Gaulle took office
and quickly canceled the secret negotiations and began an indigenous
French nuclear program, only to raise the prospect of nuclear
cooperation again with German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer in 1962. And in
the 1990s, France offered to extend its nuclear umbrella to Germany
after reunification in an attempt to decrease U.S. influence in Europe.
All these efforts failed, in part because the French consistently
refused to relinquish control over their arsenal, as to do so would have
been to give up French autonomy in foreign policy. This calculus has not
changed, a fact that should give German policymakers pause today.
Moreover, by reviving such talk, Berlin risks giving isolationist
elements in the Trump administration exactly what they want: an excuse
to disengage.

STRONGER TOGETHER

Nuclear weapons will not solve Europe\'s current woes, but Washington
should not dismiss [[German nuclear]{.mark}
[yearnings]{.mark}]{.underline}, as they [[reflect]{.mark} a **growing
sense of [uncertainty]{.mark}** [in Berlin]{.mark}. This uncertainty
[stems from an **incoherent U.S. policy**]{.mark} toward Russia, which
began **well before Trump took office**]{.underline}. Since 2000,
[[Washington has faced **competing**]{.mark} **policy
[options]{.mark}**]{.underline}: focus only on defending NATO allies and
containing Russia; offer indefinite support to former Soviet states,
such as Georgia and Ukraine, that struggle under Russian dominance; or
cooperate with Russia to tackle global security challenges.

[The United States has **experimented**]{.underline} with all three. It
has welcomed new countries into nato despite dire, if vague, warnings
from Russia. [[Washington continues to **keep the door to the alliance
open**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the hope that former Soviet states will
eventually join, [[but]{.mark} it [**lacks the resolve** to force Moscow
to respect]{.mark} the [sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline} of countries
such as Georgia and Ukraine. At the same time, successive U.S.
administrations have tried to cooperate with the Kremlin on various
issues, such as counterterrorism and stopping the Iranian nuclear
program.

Three years after the annexation of Crimea and the start of the war in
Ukraine, [[Washington]{.mark} has **yet to choose a clear policy**. This
**[inconsistency]{.mark}**, coupled with Russian aggression, [has led
Europe to the **brink of a new Cold War**]{.mark}. Add to this Trump\'s
**erratic stances**]{.underline} toward Russia and nato, [and it is
**not surprising** that Europeans are asking **what Washington\'s
long-term priorities really are** and **how the U**nited **S**tates
**intends to achieve them**]{.underline}.

[This crisis in transatlantic relations **presents many perils**, but it
also **offers opportunities for leaders** in Berlin and Washington. For
Germany, that means **taking practical steps** to increase Europe\'s
ability to **provide for its own conventional security**, not proposing
**dangerous nuclear fantasies**. Germany should]{.underline} not focus
on nato\'s blunt spending goal of two percent of gdp but instead [**seek
closer cooperation** among national]{.underline} [EU
militaries]{.underline}; contribute larger and betterequipped forces to
the eu Battlegroups; encourage eu countries to avoid duplicating one
another\'s military R & D, production, and procurement; overcome German
national pride and work to develop a common European defense industry;
and increase the resilience of eu states to Russian propaganda.

During most of the Cold War and the years since, that question seemed
settled. The European NATO members are meant to shelter under America's
nuclear "umbrella." As part of the transatlantic alliance's "nuclear
sharing," [[five]{.mark} **partner**]{.underline}
[[countries]{.underline}]{.mark} --- Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany,
Italy and Turkey --- [[host]{.underline}]{.mark} an estimated [[100
American nukes]{.mark} on]{.underline} their [soil]{.underline}. [To
retaliate]{.underline} against a Russian strike, the allies would be
able to drop these US bombs from their own planes. Aside from those
American weapons, [**[France and the UK also have their own
arsenals]{.mark}**. But [France]{.mark} has always [kept its
nukes]{.mark} [outside]{.mark} the joint strategizing of [the Western
alliance]{.mark}]{.underline} --- it's the only nation among NATO's 30
member states not to participate in the alliance's Nuclear Planning
Group. Even before Putin's war of aggression against Ukraine this year,
some Europeans worried that the American umbrella was becoming less
reliable, and thus by definition less of a deterrent. [The US has
shifted its geopolitical focus from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and
specifically toward containing China, which is now adding to its arsenal
fast]{.mark}. [Washington]{.mark} therefore has [to hold up two nuclear
umbrellas and plan for two simultaneous wars.]{.mark} [Scholars such as
[Maximilian Terhalle in Germany and Francois Heisbourg in France have
been warning that Washington, forced to choose, would probably give
priority to its commitments in Asia, and to allies such as Japan, South
Korea and Taiwan]{.mark}.]{.underline} Worse, former US President Donald
Trump spooked Europeans when he questioned NATO's mutual-defense clause
and even contemplated taking the US out of the alliance. Trump is gone
for now. But he, or a president like him, could return. In the long run,
the US appears less dependable as a protector than it used to be.
Topping all that, Putin has now gone rhetorically ballistic by dropping
not-so-veiled threats that he might use nukes against Ukraine or Western
countries that interfere in his war. The consensus for now is that he's
bluffing. But from the Baltic to Poland and beyond, Europeans would love
to know what the back-up plan is. In one scenario, France could extend
its nuclear umbrella to the whole European Union (of which the UK is no
longer a member). French President Emmanuel Macron speaks often about
achieving European "autonomy," by which he usually means independence
from the US. So he should in theory be amenable. In practice, the French
are neither willing nor able. Since Charles de Gaulle, France has always
insisted on total sovereignty over its arsenal and all decisions
pertaining to it. In that sense, visions of a Europeanized "force de
frappe," as the French call their nukes, suffer from the same problem as
ideas about a "European Army." Without a United States of Europe, it's
not clear who'd be in command, when and how. [Moreover, [the French
**arsenal isn't suited** for the job]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [France has
a **relatively small** stash of 290 nukes]{.underline}]{.mark}. [In the
event of all-out war, an adversary like Russia, with thousands of
warheads, might be tempted --- and able --- to take out those weapons
with a preemptive first strike.]{.underline} Deterrence only works if
retaliation is assured. [[France's nukes]{.mark} are also of [the
**wrong** type. They're "strategic]{.mark}" --- that is, [bombs capable
of causing many Hiroshimas]{.mark} worth of [devastation each,
and]{.mark} therefore []{.mark}meant [to be used]{.mark} only
[in]{.mark} a [total-war]{.mark} scenario to take out entire cities in
the enemy's homeland]{.underline}. If Russia were to escalate, however,
it would do so with "[tactical" nuclear weapons --- smaller warheads
deployed at short ranges to cow an enemy into submission or win specific
battles. It's [inconceivable that France]{.mark} (or anybody) [would
retaliate]{.mark} for an initial and limited tactical strike [by going
directly to **strategic** retaliation]{.mark} and thus
Armageddon.]{.underline} The upshot is that all Western nuclear powers
--- the US, France and the UK --- must add more tactical nukes to their
tool kits, to keep up with Russia and become capable of flexible
responses to its aggressions. The EU, led by Germany and France, could
collaborate in this effort. Even then, however, the Europeans would
still have to resolve the old questions about command structure.
Alternatively, countries like Germany could build their own nuclear
bombs. But for that, Germany would have to withdraw from the
international treaty against nuclear proliferation and the agreement
that allowed its reunification. Besides, Germany would have to turn its
entire postwar political culture topsy-turvy. Many of its leaders today
grew up protesting against the stationing of American missiles and nukes
in general. For the time being, the realistic answer to Putin is to keep
and patch the American umbrella. More US tactical nukes, in more places
and deliverable in more ways, is the only language understood in Moscow
and Beijing. It's also probably the only way to slow the pace of other
countries, allied or hostile, going nuclear. But the entire American
political class, on both sides of the aisle, must underwrite that US
commitment to its allies, come Trump or high water. No conclusion could
be more depressing. It amounts to entering a new tactical arms race and
therefore goes in the opposite direction of the vision behind the Treaty
on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, signed by 86 non-nuclear
countries and meant to ban these diabolical arms altogether. Instead of
eliminating nukes, we'd look for new ways of deterring their use. For
all this, blame Putin. He attacked Ukraine --- 28 years after Russia
guaranteed the country's security so Kyiv could surrender its own
Soviet-era nukes. He broke the taboo against threatening nuclear
escalation in conventional warfare. In all these, ways Putin has made
naivete and pacifism untenable. The European Union, deservedly called
the greatest "peace project" in world history, must gird for its
self-defense.

To see if they are correct, [let's consider what [international]{.mark}
[life]{.mark} might be like **[without NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
There [would be [at least]{.mark} **[five set]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
[consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[all
**negative**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[The [most]{.mark} **[catastrophic]{.mark} impact**]{.underline} of
NATO's retirement [would [be]{.mark} the [risk]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
**[Russia]{.mark}n [aggression]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[miscalc]{.mark}ulation**]{.underline}. [[Without]{.mark} a clear
[commitment]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [defend]{.mark} allied territory
[backed]{.mark} up [by]{.mark}]{.underline} an **[[America]{.mark}n
nuclear deterrent]{.underline}**, President Vladimir [[Putin]{.mark}
will certainly [see]{.mark} [opportunities]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [seize
land]{.mark}]{.underline} he believes is Russian. He has already done
this in Georgia and Ukraine. Had they not joined NATO, the Baltic states
would probably already be occupied by Russian troops. Certainly Putin
would also see an opportunity to seize more of Ukraine without the
"shadow" of NATO to protect it.

[History teaches]{.underline} us [that **[major wars]{.mark}
[start]{.mark}** [when]{.mark} **aggressive [leaders]{.mark}
[miscalculate]{.mark}**]{.underline}. German leader Adolf Hitler
attacked Poland in 1939, believing that after then-British Prime
Minister Neville Chamberlain's Munich Agreement, England would be
unlikely to respond. **[No]{.underline}**rth **[K]{.underline}**orea
[attacked]{.underline} **[So]{.underline}**uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea
in 1950 [after the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [appeared to remove Seoul from]{.underline} its
**[defensive perimeter]{.underline}**. **[Iraq]{.underline}**i leader
Saddam Hussein [invaded **Kuwait**]{.underline} in 1990,
[believing]{.underline} the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
had [signaled that it would **not respond**]{.underline}.

[In each case]{.underline}, [miscalc]{.underline}ulation [led to
**larger conflict**]{.underline}.

Secondly, [NATO's retirement would [also]{.mark} **[decrease]{.mark}**
[American]{.mark} **[military]{.mark} [reach]{.mark}**]{.underline}, its
[political influence and]{.underline} its [economic
advantage]{.underline}. [American [bases]{.mark} [throughout]{.mark}
[Europe]{.mark}]{.underline} not only [provide]{.underline} for the
[defense of Europe]{.underline} --- they [[bring]{.mark} the
[U.S.]{.mark} a continent [closer to **trouble**]{.mark}
**[spots]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} [threaten]{.mark} vital American
[interests]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fighting the Islamic State group,
clearly an American interest, would have been markedly more difficult
without permanent U.S. bases in Europe and without the American-built
coalition that included every NATO nation. Without NATO, the mutual
security interests that underpin both U.S. bases and coalition
operations would be undermined.

[This [extends to]{.mark} the [economic]{.mark} realm]{.underline}.
[U.S. [annual]{.mark} [trade]{.mark}]{.underline} in goods and services
[[with Europe]{.mark} **exceeds \$1 trillion**]{.underline}, [and U.S.
total [direct]{.mark} [investment]{.mark}]{.underline} in Europe [nears
**[\$3 trillion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [These [economic]{.mark}
[ties]{.mark} [enhance]{.mark} U.S. [prosperity]{.mark}]{.underline} and
provide American jobs, [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} they [[require]{.mark}
the **degree of [security]{.mark}**]{.underline} now [provided [by
**NATO**]{.mark} to endure]{.underline}.

[NATO's retirement would]{.underline} thirdly [**exacerbate**

**Extinction.**

Land Grab Won't Be the Last",

If Vladimir Putin is allowed to keep the land he has seized from
Ukraine, it will violate one of the modern world's few meaningful
protections of peace---its prohibition against taking territory by
force. The [West must **stand firm against**]{.underline} the [Russian
president's **imperialist aims**]{.underline}, [or else the world may
see a **resurgence** of the **vicious conquests** that **marked world
history**]{.underline} before World War II.

Before 1945, the international rule on territorial acquisitions could be
summed up as vae victis, "woe to the vanquished." Kings, sultans and
czars led bloody campaigns to take land from one another and expand
their empires abroad. Russia, Prussia and Austria once devoured Poland
completely. The Ottomans seized Eastern Europe and Egypt. As political
scientist John Vasquez says, "Of all the possible issues states can
fight over, the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that issues involving
territory . . . are the main ones prone to collective violence."

Finally, in 1945, that rule changed. Amid the wreckage of failed German
and Japanese expansionism, the United Nations Charter declared a new
rule for the world: Borders can no longer be changed by force.

This prohibition has been surprisingly successful. Between 1945 and
1975, rates of successful territorial conquest declined dramatically.
Remarkably, after 1976 no U.N. member lost territory to another by force
(except in a small Egyptian border dispute). For almost 40 years, though
wars were fought, this particular strain of war seemed to have been
eradicated completely.

Until Mr. Putin's annexation of Crimea in 2014, with his invasion of
"little green men"---Russian soldiers in unmarked green uniforms---and
then an illegitimate referendum. The West's halfhearted response to
Crimea's seizure encouraged Mr. [Putin to invade again this year and
more brutally]{.underline}. Russia's indiscriminate shelling of
civilians, to say nothing of the heinous treatment of
[Ukrain]{.underline}ians in places like Bucha, [shows how]{.underline}
~~savage~~ \[**[severe]{.underline}**\] [wars for land can
be]{.underline}.

The [Russian president's attitude is a throwback to the **bloody-minded
philosophy** that ruled before the U.N. Charter]{.underline}. In Mr.
Putin's aggressive pronouncements, one hears echoes of German
ultra-nationalist Heinrich von Treitschke, who in 1870 demanded France's
Alsace-Lorraine as a prize of the Franco-Prussian war: "These
territories are ours by the right of the sword, and we shall dispose of
them in virtue of a higher right---the right of the German nation, which
will not permit its lost children to remain strangers to the German
Empire."

Mr. Putin made similar irredentist claims about protecting Russian
speakers in Ukraine before his invasion in February. Though most people
in the Donbas don't want to be annexed (any more than most Alsatians
did), this has not stopped the Russian president's drive to re-create
his mythic "Russian world."

German leaders also desired Alsace-Lorraine's natural resources, as Mr.
Putin does Ukraine's. Hitler coveted Lorraine's rich iron mines; Mr.
Putin wants Ukraine's abundant energy. The parts of Ukraine Mr. Putin is
trying to conquer contain roughly \$1.4 trillion worth of natural gas
and coal.

Mr. Putin isn't the only modern leader with expansionist aims. Think of
Chinese President [Xi]{.underline} Jinping's [assertiveness in the
**South** and **East China seas**]{.underline}, or [Hungarian Prime
Minister]{.underline} Viktor [Orbán touting **outrageous maps**
of]{.underline} "**[Greater Hungary]{.underline}**." In dozens of
countries, [claims to foreign land could be used to **inflame support**
for **war**]{.underline}. And as we are seeing now, [wars]{.underline}
can [push other international issues **off the agenda**]{.underline}.
[Supply-chain problems]{.underline}, [epidemics]{.underline},
[nuclear]{.underline} [prolif]{.underline}eration---they can
[all]{.underline} be [overshadowed by **one man's desire to capture
territory**]{.underline}.

The West can discourage future land grabs if it stops Mr. Putin. The
U.S. and its allies should maintain their most serious
sanctions---especially the financial sanctions and boycotts of oil and
gas---until Russian troops leave Ukraine, Ukrainian refugees can return,
and internationally supervised referendums can be held in all the
territory claimed by Mr. Putin.

The [**cost will be high** if the West fails to stop]{.underline} Mr.
[Putin's **annexations**]{.underline}. [One can only **dread** how many
**lives** will be **lost** if the future of war becomes like its
**past**]{.underline}. The book of Revelation says that the first
horseman of the apocalypse rode a white horse and went forth to conquer.
Without determined action by the West on Ukraine, **[the fearsome White
Horseman may ride again]{.underline}**.

Allison's argument is alluring but wrong. In truth, the United States
has resisted the creation of rival spheres of influence for most of its
history, even as it has worked assiduously to build its own. [[**Ceding
ground** to China and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} today [[would
be]{.mark} not a recipe for stability but [a blueprint for]{.mark}
**coercion** and **[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and it would weaken
the United States' geopolitical hand vis-à-vis its rivals. Nor is a
return to spheres of influence foreordained---Washington still has the
power to prevent Beijing and Moscow from dominating their regions, so
long as it rejects Allison's advice to cut loose its vulnerable
frontline allies. A tougher, more competitive world is unavoidable. A
far more dangerous world, divided into competing superpower fiefdoms, is
not.

AN AMERICAN TRADITION

Spheres of influence have been common throughout history, but Americans
have never been quite comfortable with them. In fact, much of U.S.
foreign policy dating back to independence has consisted of efforts to
prevent rival powers from establishing such domains. In the nineteenth
century, U.S. leaders rejected the idea that any European power should
have a sphere of influence in North America or the Western Hemisphere at
large. They maneuvered---often quite ruthlessly---to evict European
powers from these areas. At the turn of the twentieth century, the
United States took this regional policy global. The so-called Open Door
policy aimed to dissuade foreign powers from carving up China, and later
all of East Asia, into exclusive spheres. Washington joined World War I
in part to prevent Germany from becoming the dominant European power. A
generation later, the United States fought to deny Japan a sphere of
influence in the Pacific and prevent Hitler from establishing primacy
over the entire Old World. During and after World War II, Washington
also engaged in quieter diplomatic and economic efforts to accelerate
the dissolution of the British Empire.

Opposition to spheres of influence is a part of U.S. diplomatic DNA.

Even during the Cold War, Americans never fully accepted Soviet control
over eastern Europe. The Truman and Eisenhower administrations sought to
roll back the Iron Curtain through ideological warfare and covert
action; later administrations expanded trade and diplomatic ties with
Warsaw Pact states as a subtler way of undermining Kremlin control. The
Reagan administration overtly and covertly supported political movements
that were challenging the Kremlin's authority from within. And when
Washington had a chance to peacefully destroy the Soviet sphere of
influence after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it did, supporting German
unification and the expansion of NATO.

[[Opposition to **spheres**]{.mark} **of influence**]{.underline}, in
other words, [[is]{.mark} a part of **[U.S.]{.mark} diplomatic
[DNA]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The reason for this, Charles Edel and I
argued in 2018, is that [spheres of influence clash with **fundamental
tenets** of U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}. Among them is [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [approach to
security]{.underline}, which holds that safeguarding the country's vital
interests and physical well-being [requires preventing rival powers from
establishing a foothold]{.underline} in the Western Hemisphere [or
dominating strategically important regions]{.underline} overseas.
Likewise, the United States' emphasis on promoting liberty and free
trade translates to a concern that spheres of influence---particularly
those dominated by authoritarian powers---would impede the spread of
U.S. values and allow hostile powers to block American trade and
investment. Finally, spheres of influence do not mesh well with American
exceptionalism---the notion that the United States should transcend the
old, corrupt ways of balance-of-power diplomacy and establish a more
humane, democratic system of international relations.

Of course, that intellectual tradition did not stop the United States
from building its own sphere of influence in Latin America from the
early nineteenth century onward, nor did it prevent it from drawing
large chunks of Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East into a global
sphere of influence after World War II. Yet the same tradition has led
the United States to run its sphere of influence far more progressively
than past great powers, which is why far more countries have sought to
join that sphere than to leave it. And since hypocrisy is another
venerable tradition in global affairs, it is not surprising that
Americans would establish their own, relatively enlightened sphere of
influence while denying the legitimacy of everyone else's.

That endeavor reached its zenith in the post--Cold War era, when the
collapse of the Soviet bloc made it possible to envision a world in
which Washington's sphere of influence---also known as the liberal
international order---was the only game in town. The United States
maintained a world-beating military that could intervene around the
globe; preserved and expanded a global alliance structure as a check on
aggression; and sought to integrate potential challengers, namely
Beijing and Moscow, into a U.S.-led system. It was a remarkably
ambitious project, as Allison rightly notes, but it was the culmination
of, rather than a departure from, a diplomatic tradition reaching back
two centuries.

GIVE THEM AN INCH...

The post--Cold War moment is over, and the prospect of a divided world
has returned. **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** is
[project]{.underline}ing [power]{.underline} in the Middle East
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} staking a claim to dominance in its "near
abroad." **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** is
[[seek]{.underline}]{.mark}ing **[[primacy]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the
western Pacific and Southeast Asia and [[using]{.underline}]{.mark} its
diplomatic and [[**economic influence** to draw countries]{.mark} around
the world]{.underline} more tightly [[into its
orbit]{.underline}]{.mark}. Both have developed the tools needed to
coerce their neighbors and keep U.S. forces at bay.

Allison is one of several analysts who have recently advanced the
argument that the United States should make a virtue of necessity---that
it should accept Russian and Chinese spheres of influence, encompassing
some portion of eastern Europe and the western Pacific, as the price of
stability and peace. The logic is twofold: first, to create a cleaner
separation between contending parties by clearly marking where one's
influence ends and the other's begins; and second, to reduce the chances
of conflict by giving rising or resurgent powers a safe zone along their
borders. In theory, this seems like a reasonable way of preventing
competition from turning into outright conflict, especially given that
countries such as Taiwan and the Baltic states lie thousands of miles
from the United States but on the doorsteps of its rivals. Yet in
reality, [a spheres-of-influence world would bring **more peril than
safety**]{.underline}.

[Russia's and China's **[spheres]{.mark} of influence** [would]{.mark}
**inevitably** [be domains of **coercion**]{.mark} and
**authoritarianism**]{.underline}. Both countries are run by illiberal,
autocratic regimes; their leaders see democratic values as profoundly
threatening to their political survival. If Moscow and Beijing dominated
their respective neighborhoods, they would naturally seek to undermine
democratic governments that resist their control---as China is already
doing in Taiwan and as Russia is doing in Ukraine---or that challenge,
through their very existence, the legitimacy of authoritarian rule. The
practical consequence of acceding to authoritarian spheres of influence
would be to intensify the crisis of democracy that afflicts the world
today.

The United States would suffer economically, too. China, in particular,
is a mercantilist power already working to turn Asian economies toward
Beijing and could one day put the United States at a severe disadvantage
on the world's most economically dynamic continent. Washington should
not concede a Chinese sphere of influence unless it is also willing to
compromise the "Open Door" principles that have animated its statecraft
for over a century.

Such costs might be acceptable in exchange for peace and security. But
[**[spheres]{.mark} of influence** [during]{.mark} the **[Cold
War]{.mark}** did not prevent the Soviets from repeatedly testing
American redlines in Berlin, [caus]{.mark}ing high-stakes [crises in
which **nuc**]{.mark}**lear [war]{.mark}** [was **a**]{.mark} **real
[possibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Nor did those spheres prevent the
two sides from competing sharply, and sometimes violently, throughout
the "Third World." [**Throughout history**,
[spheres-of-influence]{.mark}]{.underline} settlements,
[[from]{.underline}]{.mark} the Thirty Years' Peace between [**Athens**
and [**Sparta** to]{.mark}]{.underline} the Peace of Amiens between [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[K]{.underline}**ingdom [and
**[Napoleon]{.mark}ic France**]{.underline} have often
[[end]{.underline}]{.mark}ed, sooner or later, [[in
**war**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The idea that spheres of influence are a formula for peace rests on
assumptions that often go unexamined: that revisionist powers are driven
primarily by insecurity, that their grievances are limited and can be
easily satisfied, that the truly vital interests of competing powers do
not conflict, and that creative statecraft can therefore fashion an
enduring, mutually acceptable equilibrium. The trouble is that these
premises don't always hold. [[**Ideology** and]{.mark} the **quest for
[greatness]{.mark}**---not simply insecurity---often [drive]{.mark}

Four [structural forces will shape the future of
**I**]{.underline}nternational **[R]{.underline}**elations:
**[globalization]{.underline}** (but without liberal rules,
institutions, and leadership)1; multipolarity (the end of American
hegemony and wider distribution of power among states and non-states2);
the strengthening of distinctive, national and subnational identities,
as persistent cultural differences are accentuated by the disruptive
effects of Western style globalization (what Samuel Huntington called
the "non-westernization of IR"3); and secular economic stagnation, a
product of longer term global decline in birth rates combined with aging
populations.4 These structural forces do not determine everything.
[**[Environment]{.mark}**al [events]{.mark}, global **[health]{.mark}**
challenges, **internal political developments**, policy mistakes,
**[tech]{.mark}nology breakthroughs or [failures]{.mark}**, will
**intersect** [with]{.mark} structure to **[define]{.mark} our
[future]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} But]{.underline} these four [[structural
forces]{.mark} will [impact]{.mark} the]{.underline} way states behave,
in [the [capacity of]{.mark} great [powers to]{.mark} **manage their
differences**, and to **act collectively** to
[settle]{.mark}]{.underline}, rather than exploit, [the **[inevitable
shocks]{.mark}** of the next decade]{.underline}.

Some of [these]{.underline} structural forces [could be managed to
promote prosperity and **avoid war**]{.underline}. Multipolarity
(inherently more prone to conflict than other configurations of power,
given coordination problems)5 plus [globalization can work in a world of
prosperity, convergent values, and **effective conflict
management**]{.underline}. The Congress of Vienna system achieved
relative peace in Europe over a hundred-year period through informal
cooperation among multiple states sharing a fear of populist revolution.
It ended decisively in 1914. Contemporary neoliberal institutionalists,
such as John Ikenberry, accept multipolarity as our likely future, but
are confident that globalization with liberal characteristics can be
sustained without American hegemony, arguing that liberal values and
practices have been fully accepted by states, global institutions, and
private actors as imperative for growth and political legitimacy.6
Divergent values plus multipolarity can work, though at significantly
lower levels of economic growth-in an autarchic world of isolated units,
[a world envisioned by the advocates of
**[decoupling]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including the current American
president. 7 Divergent values plus globalization can be managed by
hegemonic power, exemplified by the decade of the 1990s, when the
Washington Consensus, imposed by American leverage exerted through the
IMF and other U.S. dominated institutions, overrode national
differences, but with real costs to those states undergoing "structural
adjustment programs,"8 and ultimately at the cost of global growth, as
states---especially in Asia---increased their savings to self insure
against future financial crises.9

But all four forces operating simultaneously [will [produce]{.mark} a
future of **[increasing]{.mark} internal [polarization]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **cross border [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}, diminished
economic growth and poverty alleviation, [[weakened]{.mark} global
[**institutions** and **norms**]{.mark} **of behavior**, [and
**reduced**]{.mark} **collective [capacity]{.mark}** [to
confront]{.mark} emerging challenges of global **[warming]{.mark}**,
accelerating **[tech]{.mark}nology [change]{.mark}**[,
**nuc**]{.mark}**lear [weapons]{.mark}** innovation [and
**prolif**]{.mark}eration]{.underline}. As in any effective scenario,
this future is clearly visible to any keen observer. We have only to
abolish wishful thinking and believe our own eyes.10

Secular Stagnation

This unbrave new world has been emerging for some time, as US power has
declined relative to other states, especially China, global liberalism
has failed to deliver on its promises, and totalitarian capitalism has
proven effective in leveraging globalization for economic growth and
political legitimacy while exploiting technology and the state's
coercive powers to maintain internal political control. But this new era
was jumpstarted by the world financial crisis of 2007, which revealed
the bankruptcy of unregulated market capitalism, weakened faith in US
leadership, exacerbated economic deprivation and inequality around the
world, ignited growing populism, and undermined international liberal
institutions. The skewed distribution of wealth experienced in most
developed countries, politically tolerated in periods of growth, became
intolerable as growth rates declined. A combination of aging
populations, accelerating technology, and global populism/nationalism
promises to make this growth decline very difficult to reverse. What
Larry Summers and other international political economists have come to
call "secular stagnation" increases the likelihood that illiberal
globalization, multipolarity, and rising nationalism will define our
future. Summers11 has argued that the world is entering a long period of
diminishing economic growth. He suggests that secular stagnation "may be
the defining macroeconomic challenge of our times." Julius Probst, in
his recent assessment of Summers' ideas, explains:

> ...rich countries are ageing as birth rates decline and people live
> longer. This has pushed down real interest rates because investors
> think these trends will mean they will make lower returns from
> investing in future, making them more willing to accept a lower return
> on government debt as a result.
>
> Other factors that make investors similarly pessimistic include rising
> global inequality and the slowdown in productivity growth...

> This decline in real interest rates matters because economists believe
> that to overcome an economic downturn, a central bank must drive down
> the real interest rate to a certain level to encourage more spending

The rise of nationalism/populism is both cause and effect of this
economic outlook. Lower growth will make every aspect of the liberal
order more difficult to resuscitate post-Trump. Domestic politics will
become more polarized and dysfunctional, as competition for diminishing
resources intensifies. International collaboration, ad hoc or through
institutions, will become politically toxic. Protectionism, in its
multiple forms, will make economic recovery from "secular stagnation" a
heavy lift, and the liberal hegemonic leadership and strong institutions
that limited the damage of previous downturns, will be unavailable. A
clear demonstration of this negative feedback loop is the economic
damage being inflicted on the world by Trump's trade war with China,
which--- despite the so-called phase one agreement---has predictably
escalated from negotiating tactic to imbedded reality, with no end in
sight. In a world already suffering from inadequate investment, the
uncertainties generated by this confrontation will further curb the
investments essential for future growth. Another demonstration of the
intersection of structural forces is how populist-motivated controls on
immigration (always a weakness in the hyper-globalization narrative)
deprives developed countries of Summers' recommended policy response to
secular stagnation, which in a more open world would be a win-win for
rich and poor countries alike, increasing wage rates and remittance
revenues for the developing countries, replenishing the labor supply for
rich countries experiencing low birth rates.

Illiberal Globalization

Economic weakness and rising nationalism (along with multipolarity) will
not end globalization, but will profoundly alter its character and
greatly reduce its economic and political benefits. Liberal global
institutions, under American hegemony, have served multiple purposes,
enabling states to improve the quality of international relations and
more fully satisfy the needs of their citizens, and provide companies
with the legal and institutional stability necessary to manage the
inherent risks of global investment. But under present and future
conditions these institutions will become the battlegrounds---and the
victims---of geopolitical competition. The Trump Administration's
frontal attack on multilateralism is but the final nail in the coffin of
the Bretton Woods system in trade and finance, which has been in slow
but accelerating decline since the end of the Cold War. Future American
leadership may embrace renewed collaboration in global trade and
finance, macroeconomic management, environmental sustainability and the
like, but repairing the damage requires the heroic assumption that
America's own identity has not been fundamentally altered by the Trump
era (four years or eight matters here), and by the internal and global
forces that enabled his rise. The fact will remain that a sizeable
portion of the American electorate, and a monolithically pro- Trump
Republican Party, is committed to an illiberal future. And even if the
effects are transitory, the causes of weakening global collaboration are
structural, not subject to the efforts of some hypothetical future US
liberal leadership. It is clear that the US has lost respect among its
rivals, and trust among its allies. While its economic and military
capacity is still greatly superior to all others, its political
dysfunction has diminished its ability to convert this wealth into
effective power.13 It will furthermore operate in a future system of
diffusing material power, diverging economic and political governance
approaches, and rising nationalism. Trump has promoted these forces, but
did not invent them, and future US Administrations will struggle to cope
with them.

What will illiberal globalization look like? Consider recent events. The
instruments of globalization have been weaponized by strong states in
pursuit of their geopolitical objectives. This has turned the liberal
argument on behalf of globalization on its head. Instead of
interdependence as an unstoppable force pushing states toward
collaboration and convergence around market-friendly domestic policies,
states are exploiting interdependence to inflict harm on their
adversaries, and even on their allies. [The increasing interaction
across national boundaries that globalization entails, now produces not
**harmonization** and cooperation, but **friction** and **[escalating
trade]{.mark} and investment [disputes]{.mark}**]{.underline}.14 The
Trump Administration is in the lead here, but it is not alone. Trade and
investment friction with China is the most obvious and damaging example,
precipitated by China's long failure to conform to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) principles, now escalated by President Trump into a
trade and currency war disturbingly reminiscent of the 1930s that
Bretton Woods was designed to prevent. Financial sanctions against Iran,
in violation of US obligations in the Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action
(JCPOA), is another example of the rule of law succumbing to
geopolitical competition. Though more mercantilist in intent than
geopolitical, US tariffs on steel and aluminum, and their threatened use
in automotives, aimed at the EU, Canada, and Japan,15 are equally
destructive of the liberal system and of future economic growth, imposed
as they are by the author of that system, and will spread to others. And
indeed, Japan has used export controls in its escalating conflict with
South Korea16 (as did China in imposing controls on rare earth,17 and as
the US has done as part of its trade war with China). Inward foreign
direct investment restrictions are spreading. The vitality of the WTO is
being sapped by its inability to complete the Doha Round, by the
proliferation of bilateral and regional agreements, and now by the Trump
Administration's hold on appointments to WTO judicial panels. It should
not surprise anyone if, during a second term, Trump formally withdrew
the US from the WTO. At a minimum it will become a "dead letter
regime."18

[As such measures **gain traction**, it will **become clear** to
states]{.underline}---and to companies---[that a global trading system
more responsive to raw power than to law entails **escalating risk** and
diminishing benefits. This [will]{.mark} be the **[end]{.mark} of
economic [globalization]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and its many benefits,
as we know it. [It represents]{.underline} nothing less than [the
subordination of economic globalization]{.underline}, a system which
many thought obeyed its own logic, [to an international politics of
**zero-sum power competition** among multiple actors with divergent
interests and values]{.underline}. The costs will be significant:
Bloomberg Economics estimates that the cost in lost US GDP in 2019-
dollar terms from the trade war with China has reached \$134 billion to
date and will rise to a total of \$316 billion by the end of 2020.19
Economically, the just-in-time, maximally efficient world of global
supply chains, driving down costs, incentivizing innovation, spreading
investment, integrating new countries and populations into the global
system, is being Balkanized. Bilateral and regional deals are
proliferating, while global, nondiscriminatory trade agreements are at
an end.

Economies of scale will shrink, incentivizing less investment,
increasing costs and prices, compromising growth, marginalizing
countries whose growth and poverty reduction depended on participation
in global supply chains. [A [world]{.mark} already [suffering]{.mark}
from [excess savings]{.mark}]{.underline} (in the corporate sector,
among mostly Asian countries) [will **[respond]{.mark}** to heightened
risk and uncertainty [with]{.mark} **further
[retrenchment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The problem is perfectly captured
by Tim Boyle, CEO of Columbia Sportswear, whose supply chain runs
through China, reacting to yet another ratcheting up of US tariffs on
Chinese imports, most recently on consumer goods:

[The **international [political effects]{.mark}** []{.mark}will be
equally **[damaging]{.mark}**. The]{.underline} four [structural forces
act on each other to produce the **more dangerous**]{.underline}, less
prosperous [**world** projected here. Illiberal globalization represents
geopolitical conflict by]{.underline} (at first) [physically non-kinetic
means. [It]{.mark} arises from **intensifying competition** among
powerful states with divergent interests and identities]{.underline},
but in its effects drives down growth [and **[fuels]{.mark} increased
[nationalism]{.mark}/populism**, [which]{.mark} further **[contributes
to conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Twenty-first-century protectionism
represents bottom-up forces arising from economic disruption. But it is
also a top-down phenomenon, representing a strategic effort by political
leadership to reduce the constraints of interdependence on freedom of
geopolitical action, in effect a precursor and enabler of war. This is
the disturbing hypothesis of Daniel Drezner, argued in an important May
2019 piece in Reason, titled "Will Today's [Global [Trade Wars Lead to
**World War Three**]{.mark}]{.underline},"21 which examines the pre-
World War I period of heightened trade conflict, its contribution to the
disaster that followed, and its parallels to the present:

Moreover, [a [German nuclear]{.mark} [arsenal would]{.mark} risk
**[bring]{.mark}ing [down the]{.mark} international
[nonprolif]{.mark}eration [regime]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Before
acquiring the bomb, [[Germany would have to leave the]{.mark} Nuclear
[Nonprolif]{.mark}eration [Treaty]{.mark}, [a move that would
**threaten**]{.mark} **the continued [existence of the treaty]{.mark}
itself**. Despite the NPT's successful record, [the treaty]{.mark}\'s
future **[already looks]{.mark} [uncertain]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Under
the NPT, [[states with nuclear weapons agreed to pursue
disarmament]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} in recent years, [progress]{.mark}
toward this goal [has **stalled**, and nonnuclear states have]{.mark}
**increasingly [voiced their frustration]{.mark}** that the nuclear
weapons states have not fulfilled their promise. A [**foundational
goal** of the treaty]{.mark}]{.underline}, moreover, [[was to **keep
Germany**]{.mark} **[from building nuclear weapons]{.mark}**. [If Berlin
**defected**, the]{.mark} nonproliferation [regime]{.mark} might
**[collapse]{.mark} entirely**]{.underline}, because other countries
would no longer feel bound by the treaty\'s collective bargain.

Germany would also need to modify or withdraw from the so-called Two
Plus Four Treaty, the agreement on reunification that East and West
Germany signed with France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and
the United States in 1990. In that document, Germany affirmed its
\"renunciation of the manufacture and possession of and control over
nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.\" The treaty was meant not
only to end the Cold War but also to prevent any future German
Sonderweg; abrogating it would bring back the German question and
deliver an affront to the four countries that paid such enormous costs
to defeat Nazi Germany in World War II.

Worst of all, [the [pursuit of]{.mark} a [German nuclear
arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} rather than deterring aggression,
[could **[increase]{.mark} the risk of [conflict in Europe]{.mark}**,
since [Russia would]{.mark} likely [work to **prevent Germany from
acquiring the bomb**]{.mark}. Moscow could assassinate German nuclear
scientists, use cyberattacks]{.underline} to sabotage German nuclear
industrial infrastructure, [and perhaps]{.underline} go so far as to
[strike German nuclear facilities from the air. Even covert operations
could **quickly spiral into outright confrontation**]{.underline}.

Even if Germany managed to acquire nuclear weapons, it would then face
the daunting task of making sure they could survive a Russian attack. In
recent years, Russia has moved its missiles westward, targeting Germany
and other nato members. Now that Russia has allegedly deployed multiple
cruise missiles in violation of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces Treaty, under which the Soviet Union and the United States agreed
to abandon midrange missiles, its ability to destroy a fledgling German
nuclear stockpile is only growing. Unless Germany managed to conceal and
protect its nuclear weapons almost immediately, [[German leaders]{.mark}
could]{.underline}, during a crisis with Russia, [feel pressure to
**[launch a preemptive nuclear attack]{.mark}** against Russia in order
to avoid losing the arsenal to a Russian first strike]{.underline}.

These formidable barriers to a German nuclear program have led some to
return to the idea of a British-French deterrent. But the United
Kingdom\'s impending departure from the eu leaves Germany with the sole
option of reaching out to France. This would not be the first time that
France and Germany have considered a joint European nuclear deterrent.
In 1957, shortly after the Suez crisis, when tensions between France and
the United States were running high and the French government began to
doubt the credibility of the U.S. nuclear guarantee, France suggested to
Italy and West Germany that the three countries develop nuclear weapons
together. The next year, French President Charles de Gaulle took office
and quickly canceled the secret negotiations and began an indigenous
French nuclear program, only to raise the prospect of nuclear
cooperation again with German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer in 1962. And in
the 1990s, France offered to extend its nuclear umbrella to Germany
after reunification in an attempt to decrease U.S. influence in Europe.
All these efforts failed, in part because the French consistently
refused to relinquish control over their arsenal, as to do so would have
been to give up French autonomy in foreign policy. This calculus has not
changed, a fact that should give German policymakers pause today.
Moreover, by reviving such talk, Berlin risks giving isolationist
elements in the Trump administration exactly what they want: an excuse
to disengage.

STRONGER TOGETHER

Nuclear weapons will not solve Europe\'s current woes, but Washington
should not dismiss [[German nuclear]{.mark}
[yearnings]{.mark}]{.underline}, as they [[reflect]{.mark} a **growing
sense of [uncertainty]{.mark}** [in Berlin]{.mark}. This uncertainty
[stems from an **incoherent U.S. policy**]{.mark} toward Russia, which
began **well before Trump took office**]{.underline}. Since 2000,
[[Washington has faced **competing**]{.mark} **policy
[options]{.mark}**]{.underline}: focus only on defending NATO allies and
containing Russia; offer indefinite support to former Soviet states,
such as Georgia and Ukraine, that struggle under Russian dominance; or
cooperate with Russia to tackle global security challenges.

[The United States has **experimented**]{.underline} with all three. It
has welcomed new countries into nato despite dire, if vague, warnings
from Russia. [[Washington continues to **keep the door to the alliance
open**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the hope that former Soviet states will
eventually join, [[but]{.mark} it [**lacks the resolve** to force Moscow
to respect]{.mark} the [sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline} of countries
such as Georgia and Ukraine. At the same time, successive U.S.
administrations have tried to cooperate with the Kremlin on various
issues, such as counterterrorism and stopping the Iranian nuclear
program.

Three years after the annexation of Crimea and the start of the war in
Ukraine, [[Washington]{.mark} has **yet to choose a clear policy**. This
**[inconsistency]{.mark}**, coupled with Russian aggression, [has led
Europe to the **brink of a new Cold War**]{.mark}. Add to this Trump\'s
**erratic stances**]{.underline} toward Russia and nato, [and it is
**not surprising** that Europeans are asking **what Washington\'s
long-term priorities really are** and **how the U**nited **S**tates
**intends to achieve them**]{.underline}.

[This crisis in transatlantic relations **presents many perils**, but it
also **offers opportunities for leaders** in Berlin and Washington. For
Germany, that means **taking practical steps** to increase Europe\'s
ability to **provide for its own conventional security**, not proposing
**dangerous nuclear fantasies**. Germany should]{.underline} not focus
on nato\'s blunt spending goal of two percent of gdp but instead [**seek
closer cooperation** among national]{.underline} [EU
militaries]{.underline}; contribute larger and betterequipped forces to
the eu Battlegroups; encourage eu countries to avoid duplicating one
another\'s military R & D, production, and procurement; overcome German
national pride and work to develop a common European defense industry;
and increase the resilience of eu states to Russian propaganda.

America's alliances", Vox,

How the [[weakening]{.underline}]{.mark} of [[American alliances could
lead to a **massive war**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[There has
**never**]{.mark}**, in human history, [been an era as peaceful as our
own]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is a hard truth to appreciate, given
the horrible violence ongoing in places like Syria, Yemen, and Myanmar,
yet [the evidence is **quite clear.**]{.underline} Take a look at this
chart from the University of Oxford's Max Roser. It tracks the number of
years in a given time period in which "great powers" --- meaning the
militarily and economically powerful countries at that time --- were at
war with each other over the course of the past 500 years. The decline
is unmistakable: \[\[TABLE OMITTED\]\] This data should give you some
appreciation for how unique, and potentially precarious, our historical
moment is. For more than 200 years, from 1500 to about 1750, major
European powers like Britain and France and Spain were warring
constantly. The frequency of conflict declined in the 19th and 20th
centuries, but the wars that did break out --- the Napoleonic conflicts,
both world wars --- were particularly devastating. The past 70 years
without great power war, a period scholars term "the Long Peace," is one
of history's most wonderful anomalies. The question then becomes: Why
did it happen? And could Trump mucking around with a pillar of the
global order, American alliances, put it in jeopardy? The answer to the
second question, ominously, appears to be yes. [[There is **significant
evidence**]{.underline} [that]{.underline}
**[strong]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[American
[alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- **[[most notably]{.mark} the
[NATO]{.mark} alliance]{.underline}** **[[and US agreements to defend
Japan and South Korea ---]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[have been
**instrumental in putting an end to great power
war**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} "[As this alliance system spreads and
expands, it correlates with this dramatic decline, this **unprecedented
drop, in warfare**]{.underline}," says Michael Beckley, a professor of
international relations at Tufts University. "[It's a really, really
strong correlation]{.underline}." A 2010 study by Rice's Leeds and the
University of Kentucky's Jesse C. Johnson surveyed a large data set on
alliances between 1816 and 2000. They found that [countries in defensive
alliances were **20 percent less likely**]{.underline} [to be involved
in a conflict, on average, than countries that weren't]{.underline}.
This holds true even after you control for other factors that would
affect the likelihood of war, like whether a country is a democracy or
whether it has an ongoing dispute with a powerful neighbor. In a
follow-up paper, Leeds and Johnson looked at the same data set to see
whether certain kinds of alliances were more effective at protecting its
members than others. Their conclusion is that alliances deter war best
when their members are militarily powerful and when enemies take
seriously the allies' promise to fight together in the event of an
attack. The core US alliances --- NATO, Japan, and South Korea --- fit
these descriptors neatly. A third study finds evidence that [[alliances
allow allies to **restrain each other**]{.mark} [from]{.mark} going to
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}. Let's say Canada wants to get involved in a
conflict somewhere. Typically, it would discuss its plans with the
United States first --- and if America thinks it's a bad idea, Canada
might well listen to them. There's strong statistical evidence that
countries don't even try to start some conflicts out of fear that an
ally would disapprove. These three findings all suggest that NATO and
America's East Asian alliances very likely are playing a major role in
preserving the Long Peace --- which is why Trump's habit of messing
around with alliances is so dangerous. According to many Russia experts,
Vladimir Putin's deepest geostrategic goal is "breaking" NATO. The
member states where anyone would expect him to test NATO's commitment
would be the Baltics --- Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania --- small former
Soviet republics that recently became NATO members. We can't predict if
and when a rival like Putin would conclude that America's alliances
seemed weak enough to try testing them. Hopefully, it never happens. But
the more Trump attacks the foundations of America's allies, the more
likely things are to change. [The absolute risk of a Russian invasion of
a NATO state or a North Korean attack on the South is relatively low,
but **[the consequences are so potentially catastrophic --- nuclear
war!]{.mark}**]{.underline} [--- that it's worth **taking anything that
increases the odds of such a conflict seriously.**]{.underline} The
crack-up of the West? The world order is a little like a game of Jenga.
In the game, there are lots of small blocks that interlock to form a
stable tower. Each player has to remove a block without toppling the
tower. But each time you take out a block, the whole thing gets a bit
less stable. Take out enough blocks and it will collapse. The
international order works in kind of the same way. There are lots of
different interlocking parts --- the spread of democracy, American
alliances, nuclear deterrence, and the like --- that work together to
keep the global peace. But take out one block and the other ones might
not be strong enough to keep things together on their own. At the end of
the Cold War, British and French leaders worried that the passing of the
old order might prove destabilizing. In a January 1990 meeting, French
President François Mitterrand told British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher that he feared a united Germany could seize control of even
more territory than Hitler. Some experts feared that in the absence of
the external Soviet threat, Western European powers might go back to
waging war with each other. Thankfully, those predictions turned out to
be wrong. There are multiple reasons for that, but one big one --- one
that also helped keep relations between other historical enemies, like
South Korea and Japan, peaceful --- is a shared participation in US
alliance networks. The US serves as the ultimate security blanket,
preventing these countries from having to build up their own armaments
and thus risk a replay of World War I. But if American alliance
commitments become and remain less credible, it's possible this order
could crack up. America's partners aren't stupid. They understand that
Trump is the product of deep forces in American politics, and that his
victory might not be a one-off. If they think that this won't be the
last "America First" president in modern history, depending on America
the way that they have in the past could quickly become a nightmare.
[The worst-case scenarios for a collapse in the US alliance system are
terrible. [Imagine **full**]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[Japanese and German
rearmament]{.mark}**, [alongside **rapid-fire prolif**]{.mark}eration of
nuclear weapons. [Imagine a **crack-up of NATO**]{.mark}, with
**European powers at loggerheads** [while **Russia gobbles up the Baltic
states**]{.mark} and the **rest of Ukraine**]{.underline}. [Imagine
**[South Korea's historical tensions with Japan
reigniting]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[[and a war between those two
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}** or any combination of them and China.
All of this seems impossible to imagine now, almost absurd. And indeed,
in the short run, it is. There is no risk --- zero --- of American
allies turning on each other in the foreseeable future. And it's
possible that the next president after Trump could reassure American
allies that nothing like this could ever happen again. But the truth is
that there's just no way to know. [When a fundamental force for world
peace starts to weaken, no one can really be sure how well the system
will hold up. Nothing like this --- the leader of the world's hegemon
rounding on its most important allies --- has ever happened
before.]{.underline} What Donald Trump's presidency has done, in effect,
is start up another geopolitical Jenga game. Slowly but surely, he's
removing the blocks that undergird global security. It's possible the
global order survives Trump --- but it's just too early for us to say
for sure. **[Given the stakes, it's a game we'd rather not
play.]{.underline}**

Broadly shared [economic prosperity is a bedrock of
America's]{.underline} economic and political
**[strength]{.underline}**---[both domestically and in the international
arena]{.underline}. [A strong]{.underline} and equitable
[**[recovery]{.mark}** from]{.underline} the economic crisis created by
[COVID-19 [would be]{.mark} [a]{.mark}]{.underline} powerful [[testament
to]{.mark} the **[resilience]{.mark}** of the American
system]{.underline} and its ability to create prosperity at a time of
seismic change and persistent global crisis. Such a recovery could
attack the profound economic inequities that have developed over the
past several decades. [Without **bold action**]{.underline} to help all
workers access good jobs as the economy returns, [the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [risks undermining]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[legitimacy]{.mark} of its institutions]{.underline} and its
international standing. [The outcome will be a [key determinant]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} America's national **[security]{.mark}**]{.underline} for
years to come. An equitable recovery requires a national commitment to
help all workers obtain good jobs---particularly the twothirds of adults
without a bachelor's degree and people of color who have been most
affected by the crisis and were denied opportunity before it. As the
nation engages in a historic debate about how to accelerate economic
recovery, ambitious public investment is necessary to put Americans back
to work with dignity and opportunity. We need an intentional effort to
make sure that the jobs that come back are good jobs with decent wages,
benefits, and mobility and to empower workers to access these
opportunities in a profoundly changed labor market. To achieve these
goals, American policy makers need to establish job growth strategies
that address urgent public needs through major programs in green energy,
infrastructure, and health. Alongside these job growth strategies, we
need to recognize and develop the talents of workers by creating an
adult learning system that meets workers' needs and develops skills for
the digital economy. The national security community must lend its
support to this cause. And as it does so, it can bring home the lessons
from the advances made in these areas in other countries, particularly
our European allies, and consider this a realm of international
cooperation and international engagement. Shared Economic Prosperity Is
a National Security Asset [A strong economy is essential to
America's]{.underline} security and diplomatic
**[strategy]{.underline}**. [Economic strength increases our influence
on the global stage]{.underline}, [expands markets]{.underline}, [and
funds a strong]{.underline} and agile **[military]{.underline}** and
national defense. Yet it is not enough for America's economy to be
strong for some---prosperity must be broadly shared. [Widespread belief
in the ability of the American economic system]{.underline} to create
economic security and mobility for all---the American Dream--- [creates
credibility and legitimacy for America's **values**]{.underline},
**[governance]{.underline}**, [and **alliances** around the
world]{.underline}. [After World War II,]{.underline} [the United States
grew the middle class to historic]{.underline} size and
**[strength]{.underline}**. [This]{.underline} achievement [made America
the model of **the free world**]{.underline}---[setting the stage for
decades of]{.underline} American political and economic
**[leadership]{.underline}**. Domestically, broad
[participation]{.underline} in the economy [is core to the legitimacy
of]{.underline} our [**democracy** and]{.underline} the strength of our
**[political institutions]{.underline}**. A belief that the economic
system works for millions is an important part of creating trust in a
democratic government's ability to meet the needs of the people. The
COVID-19 Crisis Puts Millions of American Workers at Risk For the last
several decades, the American Dream has been on the wane. Opportunity
has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small share of
workers able to access the knowledge economy. Too many Americans,
particularly those without four-year degrees, experienced stagnant
wages, less stability, and fewer opportunities for advancement. Since
COVID-19 hit, millions have lost their jobs or income and are struggling
to meet their basic needs---including food, housing, and medical care.1
The crisis has impacted sectors like hospitality, leisure, and retail,
which employ a large share of America's most economically vulnerable
workers, resulting in alarming disparities in unemployment rates along
education and racial lines. In August, the unemployment rate for those
with a high school degree or less was more than double the rate for
those with a bachelor's degree.2 Black and Hispanic Americans are
experiencing disproportionately high unemployment, with the gulf
widening as the crisis continues.3 The experience of the Great Recession
shows that without intentional effort to drive an inclusive recovery,
inequality may get worse: while workers with a high school education or
less experienced the majority of job losses, nearly all new jobs went to
workers with postsecondary education. Inequalities across racial lines
also increased as workers of color worked in the hardest-hit sectors and
were slower to recover earnings and income than White workers.4 The Case
for an Inclusive Recovery A [[recovery]{.underline}]{.mark} that
promotes broad economic participation, renewed opportunity, and equity
will strengthen American moral and political authority around the world.
It [[will send]{.mark} a [strong message about]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
strength and [resilience]{.mark} [of]{.mark} **democratic**
**government** and the **[America]{.mark}n people's** ability to adapt
to a changing **global** **economic** **landscape**.]{.underline} An
inclusive [recovery]{.underline} [will reaffirm American leadership as
core to the success of our]{.underline} most critical international
[alliances]{.underline}, which are rooted in the notion of shared
destiny and interdependence. For example, NATO, which has been a
cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy and a force of global stability for
decades, has suffered from American disengagement in recent years. [A
[strong]{.mark} American [recovery]{.mark}]{.underline}---coupled with a
renewed openness to international collaboration---[[is core to
NATO]{.mark}'s **ability** to solve shared **geopolitical** and
**security** **challenges**]{.underline}. [A [renewed
partnership]{.mark}]{.underline} with our European allies [from a
position of economic strength will [enable us to address]{.mark} global
crises such as [**climate** **change**]{.mark}, global
**[pandemics]{.mark}**, [and **refugees**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Together, the United States and Europe can pursue a commitment to
investing in workers for shared economic competitiveness, innovation,

Global [[retrenchment]{.mark} is]{.underline} fast [emerging
as]{.underline} the most coherent [an]{.underline}d ready-made
[alternative to the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tate[s']{.underline} postwar [strategy]{.underline}. Yet
[pursuing it would be a **grave mistake**]{.underline}. By
**[[dissolv]{.mark}ing]{.underline}** U.S.
**[[alliances]{.underline}]{.mark}** and [ending the **forward
presence** of **U.S. forces**]{.underline}, this strategy [would
**destabilize**]{.underline} the [**regional security orders** in
**Europe** and **Asia**.]{.underline} It would also [increase the risk
of **nuclear prolif**eration, **empower** **right-wing**
**[nationalists]{.mark}** in Europe, and **[aggravate]{.mark}** the
**threat** of **major-power [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

This is [not to say that U.S. strategy should never change. The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has regularly **increased**
and **decreased** its **presence** around the world as **threats** have
**risen** and **ebbed**]{.underline}. Even though Washington followed a
strategy of containment throughout the Cold War, that took various
forms, which meant the difference between war and peace in Vietnam,
between an arms race and arms control, and between détente and an
all-out attempt to defeat the Soviets. After the fall of the Soviet
Union, the United States changed course again, expanding its alliances
to include many countries that had previously been part of the Warsaw
Pact.

Likewise, the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[will]{.underline} now [have to do less in some areas and more in others
as it **shifts its focus** from **counterterrorism** and]{.underline}
reform in [the **Mid**dle **East** toward **great-power competition**
with **China** and **Russia**]{.underline}. But [advocates of global
retrenchment are not]{.underline} so much [proposing changes within a
strategy]{.underline} as they are [calling for the **wholesale
replacement**]{.underline} of one that has been in place since World War
II. What the **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[needs]{.underline} now is a [careful pruning of]{.underline} its
[overseas commitments---not]{.underline} the [**indiscriminate
abandonment** of a strategy that has served it well for
decades]{.underline}.

RETRENCHMENT REDUX

Support for retrenchment stems from the view that the United States has
overextended itself in countries that have little bearing on its
national interest. According to this perspective, which is closely
associated with the realist school of international relations, the
United States is fundamentally secure thanks to its geography, nuclear
arsenal, and military advantage. Yet the country has nonetheless chosen
to pursue a strategy of "liberal hegemony," using force in an unwise
attempt to perpetuate a liberal international order (one that, as
evidenced by U.S. support for authoritarian regimes, is not so liberal,
after all). Washington, the argument goes, has distracted itself with
costly overseas commitments and interventions that breed resentment and
encourage free-riding abroad. Critics of the status quo argue that the
United States must take two steps to change its ways. The first is
retrenchment itself: the action of withdrawing from many of the United
States' existing commitments, such as the ongoing military interventions
in the Middle East and one-sided alliances in Europe and Asia. The
second is restraint: the strategy of defining U.S. interests narrowly,
refusing to launch wars unless vital interests are directly threatened
and Congress authorizes such action, compelling other nations to take
care of their own security, and relying more on diplomatic, economic,
and political tools. In practice, this approach means ending U.S.
military operations in Afghanistan, withdrawing U.S. forces from the
Middle East, relying on an over-the-horizon force that can uphold U.S.
national interests, and no longer taking on responsibility for the
security of other states. As for alliances, Posen has argued that the
United States should abandon the mutual-defense provision of NATO,
replace the organization "with a new, more limited security cooperation
agreement," and reduce U.S. commitments to Japan, South Korea, and
Taiwan. On the question of China, realists have split in recent years.
Some, such as the scholar John Mearsheimer, contend that even as the
United States retrenches elsewhere, in Asia, it must contain the threat
of China, whereas others, such as Posen, argue that nations in the
region are perfectly capable of doing the job themselves. Since Trump's
election, some progressive foreign policy thinkers have joined the
retrenchment camp. They diverge from other progressives, who advocate
maintaining the United States' current role. Like the realists,
progressive retrenchers hold the view that the United States is safe
because of its geography and the size of its military. Where these
progressives break from the realists, however, is on the question of
what will happen if the United States pulls back. While the realists
favoring retrenchment have few illusions about the sort of regional
competition that will break out in the absence of U.S. dominance, the
progressives expect that the world will become more peaceful and
cooperative, because Washington can still manage tensions through
diplomatic, economic, and political tools. The immediate focus of the
progressives is the so-called forever wars---U.S. military involvement
in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and the broader war on terrorism---as well
as the defense budget and overseas bases. Although the progressives have
a less developed vision of how to implement retrenchment than the
realists, they do provide some guideposts. Stephen Wertheim, a
co-founder of the Quincy Institute, has called for bringing home many of
the U.S. soldiers serving abroad, "leaving small forces to protect
commercial sea lanes," as part of an effort to "deprive presidents of
the temptation to answer every problem with a violent solution." He
argues that U.S. allies may believe that the United States has been
inflating regional threats and thus conclude that they do not need to
increase their conventional or nuclear forces. Another progressive
thinker, Peter Beinart, has argued that the United States should accept
Chinese and Russian spheres of influence, a strategy that would include
abandoning Taiwan.

IS LESS REALLY MORE?

The realists and the progressives arguing for [retrenchment]{.underline}
differ in their assumptions, logic, and intentions. The realists tend to
be more pessimistic about the prospects for peace and frame their
arguments in hardheaded terms, whereas the progressives downplay the
consequences of American withdrawal and make a moral case against the
current grand strategy. But they share a common claim: that the United
States would be better off if it dramatically reduced its global
military footprint and security commitments.

This [is a **false promise**]{.underline}, for a number of reasons.
First, [retrenchment would [worsen **regional security**]{.mark}
**competition** [in **Europe** and **Asia**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
realists recognize that the U.S. military presence in Europe and Asia
does dampen security competition, but they claim that it does so at too
high a price---and one that, at any rate, should be paid by U.S. allies
in the regions themselves. Although pulling back would invite regional
security competition, realist retrenchers admit, the United States could
be safer in a more dangerous world because regional rivals would check
one another. [This is a perilous gambit]{.underline}, however, because
[regional conflicts often end up **implicating U.S.
interests**]{.underline}. They might thus end up [[drawing]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[back]{.mark} in after it has **left**---resulting in a much **[more
dangerous]{.mark}** venture than **heading off** the conflict in the
first place by staying.]{.underline} Realist retrenchment reveals a
hubris that the United States can control consequences and prevent
crises from erupting into war.

The progressives' view of regional security is similarly flawed. These
retrenchers reject the idea that regional security competition will
intensify if the United States leaves. In fact, they argue, U.S.
alliances often promote competition, as in the Middle East, where U.S.
support for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates has emboldened
those countries in their cold war with Iran. But this logic does not
apply to [**Europe** or **Asia**, where U.S. allies have **behaved
responsibly**]{.underline}. A U.S. **[pullback]{.underline}** from those
places [is more likely to **[embolden]{.mark}** the **regional
powers**]{.underline}. Since 2008, [**[Russia]{.mark}** has invaded two
of its neighbors]{.underline} that are not members of NATO, and [if the
Baltic states were no longer protected by a U.S. security guarantee, it
is conceivable that Russia would **test** the **boundaries** with
**[gray-zone warfare]{.mark}**. In East Asia, a U.S. **withdrawal**
would [**force Japan** to]{.mark} increase its defense capabilities and
change its constitution to enable it to **[compete]{.mark} with China**
on its own, [**straining relations** with **So**]{.mark}uth
**[Ko]{.mark}**rea.]{.underline}

The [second problem with retrenchment involves]{.underline} nuclear
[**prolif**eration. If the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[**pulled out** of **NATO** or ended its alliance with
**Japan**]{.underline}, as many realist advocates of retrenchment
recommend, some of its [[allies]{.mark}, no longer protected by the U.S.
**nuclear umbrella**, would be tempted to [**acquire** **nuclear
weapons**]{.mark} of their own.]{.underline} Unlike the progressives for
retrenchment, the realists are comfortable with that result, since they
see deterrence as a stabilizing force. Most Americans are not so
sanguine, and rightly so. There are good reasons to worry about nuclear
proliferation: [nuclear **[materials]{.mark}** could [end up in]{.mark}
the hands of [**terrorists**, states]{.mark} with **less experience**
might be more [prone to]{.mark} **nuclear [accidents]{.mark}**, and
nuclear powers in **close proximity** have **shorter** **response
times** and thus **[conflicts]{.mark}** among them have a **greater
chance** of **[spiral]{.mark}ing** into **escalation**]{.underline}.

Third, [retrenchment would [**heighten** **nationalism**]{.mark} and
**xenophobia**. In Europe]{.underline}, a U.S. [withdrawal would send
the message that every country must fend for itself.]{.underline} It
would therefore [[empower]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[**[far-right]{.mark}** groups already making this
claim]{.underline}---such as the Alternative for Germany, the League in
Italy, and the National Front in France---while
**[undermining]{.underline}** the [**centrist** democratic
leaders]{.underline} there [who told]{.underline} their [populations
that they could rely on the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and **NATO**]{.underline}. As a result,
[Washington would **lose leverage** over the **domestic politics** of
**individual allies**, particularly **younger** and **more fragile**
democracies such as Poland]{.underline}. And [since]{.underline} these
[nationalist **populist groups** are almost [always
**protectionist**]{.mark}, retrenchment would [damage]{.mark} U.S.
**[economic interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as well. Even more
alarming, many of the [right-wing nationalists that retrenchment would
empower have called for greater **[accommod]{.mark}ation** of [**China**
and **Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[A fourth problem concerns **regional stability** after global
retrenchment]{.underline}. The [most likely end state is]{.underline} a
[**[spheres-of-influence]{.mark}** system, where]{.underline}by
[**China** and **Russia** dominate]{.underline} their
[neighbors]{.underline}, but [such an order is inherently
**[unstable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [lines of demarcation for such
spheres tend to be **[unclear]{.mark}**, and there is **[no
guarantee]{.mark}** that China and Russia will not seek to
**[move]{.mark} them [outward]{.mark}** over time.]{.underline}
Moreover, the **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[cannot]{.underline} simply [grant other major powers a sphere of
influence---the countries that would fall into those realms have agency,
too.]{.underline} If the United States ceded Taiwan to China, for
example, the Taiwanese people could say no. [The current U.S. policy
toward the country is working and]{.underline} may be
**[sustainable]{.underline}**. [**Withdrawing support** from Taiwan
**against its will** would **[plunge]{.mark}** **cross-strait
[relations]{.mark}** [into chaos]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The entire idea
of letting regional powers have their own spheres of influence has an
**imperial air**]{.underline} that is at odds with modern principles of
sovereignty and international law.

A fifth problem with **[[retrenchment]{.underline}]{.mark}** is that it
[**[lacks]{.mark}** **domestic [support]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
American people may favor greater burden sharing, but there is no
evidence that they are onboard with a withdrawal from Europe and Asia.
As a survey conducted in 2019 by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs
found, [**seven out of ten** Americans believe that]{.underline}
maintaining [military superiority makes the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates **[safer]{.underline}**, and almost
[t**hree-quarters** think that **alliances** **contribute** to U.S.
**security**.]{.underline} A 2019 Eurasia Group Foundation poll found
that over [60 percent of Americans want to maintain or **increase**
**defense spending**. As it became apparent]{.underline} that [China and
Russia would **benefit** from]{.underline} this shift toward
[retrenchment, and as the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates'
democratic **[allies objected]{.underline}** to its withdrawal, the
[**domestic** **political [backlash]{.mark}** would
**grow**]{.underline}. One [result could]{.underline} be a
[**prolonged** foreign policy debate]{.underline} [that would
[cause]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[to **oscillate**]{.mark} between
**retrenchment** and **reengagement**, creating **uncertainty**
about]{.underline} its [commitments and]{.underline} thus
[[raising]{.mark} the [risk of **miscalc**]{.mark}ulation by
**Washington**]{.underline}, its [**allies**, or]{.underline} its
**[rivals]{.underline}**.

Realist and progressive retrenchers like to argue that the architects of
the United States' postwar foreign policy naively sought to remake the
world in its image. But the real revisionists are those who argue for
retrenchment, a geopolitical experiment of unprecedented scale in modern
history. If this camp were to have its way, [**Europe** and
**Asia**---two **stable**, **peaceful**, and **prosperous regions** that
form the two **main pillars** of the **U.S.-led order**---would be
**plunged** into an era of **uncertainty**]{.underline}.

This assumption contradicts events of recent months and the historical
record. While Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} has [claimed that his goal is
**keeping Ukraine** **out of NATO**]{.underline}, he [also insisted that
he was just conducting **military exercises**]{.underline}. Instead, he
is invading Ukraine again. He likewise insisted in 2014 that he wasn't
capturing Crimea, despite the presence of his unidentified "Little Green
Men" and his subsequent annexation of the peninsula, or that he was not
fighting in Ukraine's Donbas area in the east all these years, despite
all evidence to the contrary. There is no reason to take Putin at his
word. His Feb. 21 diatribe conferring Russian recognition of
independence for the two eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and
Luhansk and his order for Russian troops to move in as ostensible
"peacekeepers" shows clearly his disdain for diplomatic resolutions.

Moreover, [this is **[not even]{.mark}**]{.underline} primarily
**[[about NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[NATO's]{.underline} eastward [expansion may have played a role in
straining]{.underline} the [relationsh]{.underline}ip between Russia and
the West, [but mainly]{.underline} [because]{.underline}, [[for
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[seeing]{.mark} [former]{.mark}
[satellites]{.mark} **eagerly [abandon]{.mark}** [**it**
for]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[greener pastures]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of Euro-Atlantic integration **[[stung]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However,
[[Putin's]{.mark} [rhetoric and actions]{.mark} over]{.underline} almost
[**two decades** [reveal]{.mark} that his [goals]{.mark} [extend]{.mark}
[beyond]{.mark} [imposing **neutrality** on **Ukraine**]{.mark}
[or]{.mark}]{.underline} even [[staving off]{.mark} further **[NATO
expansion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [larger [objective]{.mark} is to
**[re-establish]{.mark}** [Russian]{.mark} political and cultural
**[dominance]{.mark}** over a nation]{.underline} that [Putin sees **as
one with Russia**]{.underline}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} then follow
up by [[undo]{.underline}]{.mark}ing the [**[European]{.mark}
rules-based [order]{.mark}** and **security architecture**]{.underline}
established in the aftermath of World War II. Given these goals,
Ukrainian neutrality is a woefully insufficient concession for Putin.

[[If]{.mark} Russia's **[main concern]{.mark}** had [been]{.mark}
**[NATO]{.mark} enlargement**]{.underline}, [it [would have]{.mark}
[reacted]{.mark} with rhetoric]{.underline} and/[or hostile actions in
its neighborhood [after]{.mark} [each]{.mark} step in]{.underline} the
[NATO [expansion]{.mark}]{.underline} process. The [largest wave of
NATO's]{.underline} eastward [expansion took place in]{.underline} March
[2004]{.underline}, when seven Eastern European countries joined,
including the formerly Soviet Baltic states. Russia "grumbled," as the
New York Times put it then, by adopting a Duma resolution criticizing
the expansion, but **[no hostile and]{.underline}** sustained
[**rhetoric** **followed** about NATO enlargement]{.underline} as a
Western plot against Russian interests.

In 1997, Ukraine's [President]{.underline} Leonid [Kuchma]{.underline}
signed the Charter on a Distinctive Partnership between NATO and
Ukraine, and [in **2002**]{.underline}, he [publicly declared
**Ukraine's interest** in **NATO membership**]{.underline}, [to **little
opposition** from Russia]{.underline}. The [NATO membership]{.underline}
issue has ebbed-and-[**flowed** within Ukraine]{.underline}, [as
presidents alternated]{.underline} in power who were either more
pro-Western or more pro-Russian. Ukrainian [President]{.underline}
Viktor [Yushchenko advocated during]{.underline} his [**2005-2010
tenure** for Ukraine to be **granted**]{.underline} a
**[NATO]{.underline}** **[membership]{.underline}** action plan (MAP), a
program of preparation for entry into the alliance, while successor
President Viktor Yanukovych backed away from the idea after 2010.
[[Russia **did not**]{.mark} **[respond]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
[any]{.mark} of these [pro-NATO]{.mark} [moves by]{.mark}
[Ukrain]{.mark}]{.underline}ian presidents [with military threats and
aggression]{.underline}.

[[Russia knows]{.mark} [further]{.mark} NATO
[expansion]{.mark}]{.underline} to the east [is **[highly
improbable]{.mark}** because certain [alliance]{.mark}
[members]{.mark}]{.underline} have [**long** **balked** at the
prospect]{.underline}, [[maki]{.mark}ng]{.underline} the required
[[consensus]{.mark} **[impossible]{.mark}** **to attain**]{.underline}.
[Russia]{.underline} also [has an **authoritarian ally**
with]{.underline}in NATO, [**Hungary's** **P**]{.underline}rime
**[M]{.underline}**inister Viktor **[Orbán]{.underline}**,
[who]{.underline} can [help **stave off** any **future
consensus**]{.underline}, and other NATO members such as [**Germany**
and **France** **do not support** membership for
**Ukraine**]{.underline}, **[Georgia]{.underline}**, [or other
**post-Soviet states**]{.underline}. The [security
guarantee]{.underline} that [Russia demands]{.underline} now [goes
**much further** than membership issues]{.underline}. Putin's Feb. 21
speech shows he perceives any security cooperation between Ukraine and
NATO, from modernization of airports to training exercises, as a "knife
to \[Russia's\] throat."

Even after a new [pro-Western government in
[Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} that [followed]{.underline} the
[**[2014]{.mark}** incursions]{.underline} again
**[[embraced]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [**goal** of NATO
[membership]{.mark} and Ukrainian **[public support]{.mark}** for such a
move [rose]{.mark}]{.underline}, Ukraine's accession was that much more
unlikely because of the alliance's reluctance to embrace new members
embroiled in territorial disputes. [[If Putin's]{.mark} [main]{.mark}
[concern]{.mark} now [was to]{.mark} [keep]{.mark} [Ukraine]{.mark}
[out]{.mark} of NATO]{.underline}, [[he had nothing]{.mark} [to
fear]{.mark} [in 2014]{.mark}]{.underline}, when he first invaded
Ukraine [[and]{.mark} had [**even less to fear** in
2021]{.mark}]{.underline}, when he embarked on the current escalation.
