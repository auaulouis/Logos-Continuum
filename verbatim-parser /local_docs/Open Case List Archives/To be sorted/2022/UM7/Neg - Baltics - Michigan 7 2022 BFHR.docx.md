[The Lithuanian government says it is simply enforcing European Union
sanctions on goods, but Russia has responded with outrage, saying it is
being stopped from accessing its sovereign territory. Russia promised to
respond in a way that would \"have a serious negative impact on the
population of Lithuania\". Then, a few days later, came this cyber
attack. Does that mean Russia attacked a NATO member? Not so
fast.]{.underline} For a start, [the group that claimed responsibility
denies any connection to the Russian state, saying it is \"not
affiliated with any law enforcement authorities\". The Russian
government has long used third-party criminal groups to conduct hacks
and cyber attacks, so it would not come as a surprise if it was
involved. Nevertheless, on the surface at least, its hands are
clean.]{.underline} Then there\'s the nature of the attack. Reports so
far suggest that it\'s a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, a
crude attack which involves throwing huge amounts of traffic at a
website until it is forced offline. [The attack has been described as
\"massive\", which is technically true, because in order to work a DDoS
attack has to be large, but that doesn\'t mean it will have a massive
effect. DDoS attacks are so common that most websites nowadays have
protection against them as standard. Even if an attack does work, it
won\'t steal any data. It\'s a blunt force instrument, little more. Less
worrying than we are often led to believe]{.underline} Cyber attacks
aren\'t like physical attacks, where the size of the damage roughly
corresponds to the size of the assault. Online, being \"massive\"
doesn\'t really mean that much. Ditto \"intense\", another word used to
describe the attack. [This is one reason why, for all the frightening
rhetoric that surrounds them, many experts believe that cyber attacks
are generally much less worrying than we are often led to
believe.]{.underline}

### Cyber\-\--No Nuke War

#### No nuclear escalation. They don't benefit from it.

Would Nuclear Coercion Be Effective Against the Baltic Countries and
NATO?

Russian attempts at nuclear blackmail will likely be ineffective. First,
as many analysts point out, [[Russia **does not need** to use nuclear
weapons]{.mark} in order [to conquer the Baltics]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[The force ratios]{.underline}]{.mark} [already [heavily favor
it]{.mark}, [even with NATO's]{.mark}]{.underline} enhanced [[Forward
Presence]{.underline}]{.mark} being regionally deployed since 2017
(Lanoszka & Hunzeker 2019; Shlapak & Johnson 2016). Second, [[threats to
use]{.mark} nuclear weapons **[lack
believability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Not only would it
**deepen**]{.mark} [Russia's isolated]{.mark} international
[status]{.mark}, [it would]{.mark} also most likely [precipitate
the]{.mark} **very [thing]{.mark}** [that Russia would **prefer to
avoid**]{.mark}]{.underline}: [**greater [involvement]{.mark}** [by the
United States]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Why would it risk its]{.mark} own
**complete [destruction]{.mark}** [for the sake of]{.mark} taking
[**three** Baltic countries]{.mark}, especially when Kaliningrad already
gives it access to the Baltic Sea]{.underline}? Third, a sudden move
against the Baltic countries would be offensive in nature. It would not
involve Russia having its back up against the wall. If the United States
were to attack Russia, then nuclear weapons use could be expected. As
stated earlier, Russia would be peculiar if it allowed hostile forces to
attack it successfully using conventional military weapons.

#### MAD.

Implications for Baltic Security

Given these parameters of the security environment [[in the
**Baltic**]{.mark} **region**, what are the prospects of nuclear
coercion]{.underline}? Recall the three points made earlier. First,
[[escaping MAD is **extremely difficult**]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
**[costly]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Even when the United States enjoyed
nuclear superiority]{.underline} over the Soviet Union, [its leaders did
not believe that they were invulnerable to a devastating
riposte]{.underline}. Second, leaders might still think that they can
leverage coercive advantages from their nuclear weapons. Third, despite
these beliefs, [**nuclear [coercion]{.mark}** [does not have a **good
track record**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with its effectiveness highest when
the circumstances are defensive and extreme.

Can Russia Escape MAD?

[[Russia would face]{.mark} **[tremendous hurdles]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[if it were to try to overcome **MAD**]{.underline}]{.mark}. To do so,
[its current modernization program would be **inadequate**]{.underline}
[since it would need to launch a **bolt-from-the-blue** first strike
against all three legs of the U.S. nuclear triad]{.underline}.
Specifically, Russia would have to enhance its submarine warfare
capabilities significantly in order to track and to kill American (and
British) nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines that could launch
SLBMs against Russian targets. It would need capabilities for destroying
hardened ICBM sites located across the United States and striking
airbases before nuclear-armed bombers can take off. It would also need
to develop a sophisticated air defense system to destroy any incoming
long-range, stand-off nuclear missiles that the United States is hoping
to get for those bombers. In a strategic exchange, Russia must achieve
all of these tasks before U.S. nuclear weapons rain down on Russian
cities and military sites. Since the 1970s at least, the United States
has been developing impressive counterforce capabilities due to
improvements in remote sensing, guidance systems, data processing,
communication, and other computing technologies (Lieber & Press 2017:
18--32). That Britain and France have their own nuclear arsenals also
complicates Russian targeting.

[Escaping MAD does not appear to be a goal behind the motivation of
Russia's modernization program]{.underline} (Podvig 2018). To the
contrary, [[Russian]{.mark} military [strategists are **acutely
aware**]{.mark} [of their country's inferiority relative to]{.mark} the
United States and **[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As chief of the
General Staff, Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov recognized in the early 1980s
that a revolution in military affairs was afoot. Conventional weapons
gained effectiveness thanks to advances in guidance systems and
information processing. He and his colleagues began to appreciate that
Warsaw Pact forces could soon lose their long-held advantages with
regard to the conventional balance (Adamsky 2010: 28--32). The Cold War
ended within a decade and Russia oversaw the rapid deterioration of its
armed forces throughout the 1990s. The modernization programs overseen
by Putin and his defense ministers have served to rectify the neglect
during those years (Renz 2016). Nevertheless, Russian military theorists
write extensively of the unfavorable strategic balance. Retired General
Makhmut Gareev (2016), current Chief of the General Staff Valery
Gerasimov (2014), S. G. Chekinov, and S. A. Bogdanov (2011), and current
Commander of the Western Military District A. V. Kartapolov (2015) have
all opined how Russia has lagged behind the United States and the West
in its ability to fight non-traditional wars -- that is, wars in which
information and proxy conflicts play major roles.

In particular, they have asked us what the likelihood is of Russia
invading Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania, and to a lesser degree what the
likely knock-on effects are on these countries from a prolonged conflict
in Ukraine.

Our top line forecasts for the Baltic states are as follows:

- [[It is **highly unlikely**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[that Russia will
  initiate an invasion of]{.mark} any of [the Baltic]{.mark}
  states]{.underline} in coming months, [[**particularly** while]{.mark}
  its military is [engaged in **Ukraine**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

- [[At]{.mark} **more than [300km]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[at their
  closest]{.mark}, [it is]{.mark} **[very
  unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that the [fighting in Ukraine will
  lead to]{.mark} any **[inadvertent]{.mark}** military [escalation or
  **accident**]{.mark} [in the Baltic]{.mark} states]{.underline}.

- There is a reasonable chance of a military accident in countries
  directly bordering Ukraine involving [[NATO and
  Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n forces, but we anticipate that both
  [[would seek to **de-escalate quickly**]{.underline}]{.mark} in this
  event.

- In the longer term, citizens in the Baltics are highly likely to feel
  the brunt of Western sanctions and Russia's economic retaliation, with
  high gas prices and drops in trade volume directly impacting
  businesses and households.

Military implications

Our interstate conflict risk ratings for the Baltic states are low. All
three are NATO members, and so the rest of the alliance are bound to
them by Article 5 on collective defence. [[Russia has
shown]{.underline}]{.mark} little to **[[no]{.mark} aggressive
[intent]{.mark}]{.underline}** [or presented any kind of **genuine**
military threat [towards the Baltics in **recent years**]{.mark}, nor
since the invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. And [[with a **significant
proportion**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of its forces]{.underline}]{.mark}
now [[inside Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} (and [[sustaining **major
casualties**]{.underline}]{.mark}), [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}
probably [[lacks the **resources** to commit]{.mark} an invasion-scale
force [to the Baltics]{.mark}]{.underline}, at least any time soon.

#### No chance of accidents. 

**SIAS 22** \[Dragonfly\'s Security Intelligence & Analysis Service

KL\]

The proximity of Russian airstrikes and anti-aircraft fire to Ukraine's
borders with Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia (all NATO members)
means [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}re is a [[risk of a military
accident]{.underline}]{.mark} there, albeit a
**[[low]{.underline}]{.mark}** one. Our three main scenarios for such an
event include a Russian military aircraft violating NATO airspace,
Russia striking a NATO country-flagged vessel in the Black Sea, and
Russian projectiles fired in Ukraine landing in NATO territory (see
P-14-03-22-EU/EA-1 for a detailed breakdown of these scenarios).

Of these, [[a Russian aircraft]{.mark} crossing [in]{.mark}to [NATO
airspace is]{.mark} the **[most likely]{.mark}** to affect the Baltic
states]{.underline}. Russian jets often made such incursions prior to
the conflict, prompting NATO to start the Baltic Air Policing initiative
in 2004. [[We have not seen reports]{.mark} of any incursion there since
the invasion]{.underline}. [But **even if** such an incident
happened]{.underline}, we anticipate that their [[militaries would
**refrain from shooting**]{.mark} a Russian aircraft down and only
scramble their jets to escort it away]{.underline}. This is what Hungary
did when an unidentified military drone from Ukraine crossed its
airspace on 10 March.

[**[Even if]{.mark}** any of [these scenarios occurred]{.mark}, we still
anticipate [NATO and Russia would]{.mark}]{.underline} very probably try
to [[**prevent tensions** from escalating]{.underline}]{.mark} into a
wider conflict. But it is likely that NATO would deploy more forces on
its eastern flank and member states in the region adopt some emergency
measures, with potential operational impacts for organisations based
there. In the absence of precedent, we assess that this would plausibly
range from military deployments temporarily disrupting operations at
airports, increased checks on goods and people on the borders, up to
national states of emergency and closures of airspace.

#### Russia won't use ethnic justifications.

[[One]{.mark} outlier [scenario]{.mark}]{.underline} that clients have
raised with us [[relates to Moscow alleging violations of]{.mark} the
rights of [ethnic Russians]{.mark} in the Baltics [to justify a]{.mark}
military [intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is what it did ahead
of the invasion of Ukraine in February, as well as in Crimea in 2014.
Russian speakers account for around 34% of the population in Latvia, 30%
in Estonia, and 8% in Lithuania. But we assess that [[this scenario is
**extremely unlikely**]{.underline}]{.mark} at this stage. [[Russia's
influence over Russian]{.mark} ethnic [minorities in the Baltics has
**declined**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in recent years, [particularly
after]{.mark} the [authorities shut]{.mark} several
[Russian]{.mark}-language [media outlets]{.mark}]{.underline} after

Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Lithuania 2021 (06/18/2021,
"Baltic energy security issues at the centre of US attention"
https://enmin.lrv.lt/en/news/baltic-energy-security-issues-at-the-centre-of-us-attention)

["Strengthening energy sector cybersecurity preparedness remains a
national security priority for all countries," said Vice-Minister of
Energy Albinas Zananavičius at the second meeting of the transatlantic
high-level working group that took place on 15-17 June in Washington, DC
(USA). According to Mr Zananavičius, the need to focus efforts on
strengthening competencies in this area is confirmed by the still
frequent cases of attacks by hostile countries against national energy
infrastructure. This working group for strengthening cooperation between
the United States and European countries in the field of energy
cybersecurity was established during the second meeting of the
Partnership for Transatlantic Energy Cooperation (P-TEC) that was held
in Vilnius in 2019. The working group is chaired by Lithuania and the
United States, and other member nations -- Estonia, Latvia, Poland,
Bulgaria and Croatia -- participate in its activities. "Cyber-attacks on
energy infrastructure are a cross-border threat. They pose equally
serious concern about the security of our energy infrastructure on both
sides of the Atlantic. Therefore, we must work together by sharing both
good practices and lessons learned in this area,"]{.underline} said Mr
Zananavičius, inviting the countries participating in the working group
to continue the work started. One example of a cyber-threat is the
attack on a top US fuel supplier a month ago. [Progress in implementing
the working group's action plan was also discussed during the meeting.
The countries mutually agreed that the Cyber Strike Workshop held by
experts from the US Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory
this March-April was very useful in strengthening the cyber security
competencies of experts working in the energy sector. **This is one of
the first examples of successful collaboration in this
format.**]{.underline} The members of the working group agreed to
continue their cooperation in implementing the objectives set out in the
action plan. For example, one of the most important goals for Lithuania
and the other Baltic States is to strengthen cyber security capabilities
for their synchronisation with the continental European network. [During
the visit, Mr Zananavičius also met with representatives of the US
Administration, Department of Energy, State Department and Congress, as
well as with energy companies operating in the field of liquefied
natural gas and green energy technologies such as hydrogen.]{.underline}
During the meetings, the Vice-Minister of Energy presented the energy
security situation in the region and Lithuania's goals in strengthening
energy independence and security. US representatives reaffirmed their
support for Lithuania in pursuing greater energy independence and energy
security. [The US will continue to support energy security issues in
Europe that require special attention, including natural gas
diversification and Nord Stream 2, as well as nuclear safety in the EU
neighbourhood.]{.underline}

[As the fighting in Ukraine drags on, another conflict is taking shape
elsewhere on Russia's periphery. This borderless conflict is **aimed at
destabilizing the Baltic states** of **Estonia**, **Latvia** and
**Lithuania**, but can and **likely will expand to engulf
others.**]{.underline} Last month, [Lithuanian government and public
service Web portals were hit by a sustained cyberattack from Russian
hackers.]{.underline} The attack was a [response to Lithuanian
enforcement of a European Union]{.underline} [sanctions package on goods
traveling to and from Kaliningrad,]{.underline} a Russian territory
located between Lithuania and Poland. In taking responsibility for the
attack, Russian hackers promised that more would be forthcoming. "[The
attack will continue until Lithuania lifts the blockade," a spokesman
for the group told Reuters.]{.underline} "We have demolished 1,652 Web
resources. And that's just so far." The Baltic states have been on the
front lines of cyber warfare for decades. As the first countries to
establish independence from the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, they
have remained decidedly anti-Russian in their posture and thus have
borne the brunt of Russia's increasingly sophisticated cyber offensive.
[In 2007, the Estonian parliament, several ministries, media
institutions, and banks suffered a series of severe
cyberattacks]{.underline} over the country's stance on relocating a
Soviet-era monument in the capital Tallinn. Officials in the Baltics
viewed the attack as a precursor to an offensive that could knock out
power grids and make the country in essence ungovernable. The severity
of the offensive, which lasted 22 days, forced Estonia to set up
measures to insulate the country from digital warfare. [The approach was
simple: Put as many government services and systems on private, secure
networks and beef up cybersecurity.]{.underline} **[[Such a model
wouldn't work in every country.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Still, given
their small sizes and large information-technology sectors, [the Baltic
states offer a blueprint for how cybersecurity systems can be built to
withstand the vulnerabilities of our technological age.]{.underline}
[The silver lining of this defensive posture is that Baltic citizens
live in digital republics,]{.underline} as The New Yorker once described
Estonia. [By investing in complex digital infrastructure, the Estonian
government enables citizens and residents to conduct most of their lives
online.]{.underline} They can sign and access virtually all government
services digitally using their unique Estonian digital identity, a
system that was established in 2002. Countries in the Middle East, such
as the United Arab Emirates and Israel, [are paying particular attention
to how the shifting contours of cyber warfare and defense strategies
unfold]{.underline}. Whatever happens, [cyberattacks will define the
future of conflict, and the steps taken by the Baltic states to defend
against Russian aggression should be watched closely for clues on how
that future will play out.]{.underline}

Getting Ahead of the Evolving Threat [The task now for the EU and NATO
is to find consensus around how to approach and limit cybersecurity
threats]{.underline}. [Transatlantic cooperation is key to]{.underline}
**[more effectively prevent, detect, and deter
cyber-attacks]{.underline}**, as well as to hold the perpetrators
accountable. As such, the EU and NATO must continue to think how to
deepen and widen existing cooperation in cybersecurity and defense. The
following recommendations are not necessarily implementable tomorrow,
but they are achievable. We offer some ambitious goals to work toward,
envisioning what the EU and NATO "should" do, not only what they "can"
do, within current political realities. [Develop a Joint Cyber Threat
Analysis Hub]{.underline} The [E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion
[and NATO have already demonstrated their ability to work together in
jointstructures]{.underline}, most recently through their support for
the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats in
Helsinki. [Creating an EU--NATO Cyber Threat Analysis Hub could
be]{.underline} another [significant step toward institutional
cooperation]{.underline}. The first task of the Hub would be to
[monitor]{.underline} and analyze technical level [early-warning
indicators on cyber threats]{.underline} and [provide enriched
output]{.underline} for operational and strategic levels. The Hub would
leverage capacities provided by relevant EU and NATO institutions, as
well as the private sector. Clearly, it will not be easy to bring these
actors together. Nonetheless, [this structure would be the
ideal]{.underline} **[for building a shared civilian-military,
public-private, and EU-- NATO situational awareness]{.underline}**.
[Such a hub would bring together]{.underline} **[all-source
information]{.underline}** [(open-source, anonymized, and sanitized
information from public and non-public sources, including classified
ones), and analyze it to foster shared situational
awareness]{.underline}. Operational level incident situation reports
from EU and NATO entities should be shared in the Hub, and it would have
a central role in sharing strategic level reports in case crisis
response mechanisms are activated by the EU or NATO. The Hub should act
to [improve information sharing,]{.underline} by developing technical
and operational level Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) [for
information exchange between the EU and NATO entities]{.underline}. The
Hub could also [facilitate]{.underline} both informal ad hoc and formal
regular information sharing and enable [secure lines of communication to
share confidential cyber intelligence]{.underline}. As a first
trust-building measure for better information sharing, the Hub could
therefore help define what type of information needs to be shared, who
needs to receive it, when the information needs to be shared, and make
sure the information is released in a timely and appropriate manner. An
G\|M\|F December 2017 4 Policy Brief important function in this respect
would be to align technical cyber incident information (from CSIRTs)
with military intelligence threat assessments. [Create Joint Committee
for Cyber Research and Technology Innovation Innovation]{.underline} by
[**the private sector in new cyber** technologies is outpacing that of
governments,]{.underline} **[and capacity gaps between governments are
also vast]{.underline}**. [The EU and NATO should create a Cyber
Innovation Committee]{.underline} [to]{.underline} help
[address]{.underline} the [technology gap between the public and private
sectors]{.underline} and [reduce the **uneven preparedness** among
member states]{.underline}. The [Committee would consist of]{.underline}
[EU and NATO civilian and military officials]{.underline},
[researchers]{.underline}, [experts]{.underline}, and technology
entrepreneurs, whose task would be [to look at the private sector market
and identify]{.underline} the [innovative tools]{.underline} [that are
relevant to member states]{.underline}. The Committee would
[complement]{.underline} the efforts of countries that have already set
us similar [taskforces at national level]{.underline}, or assist the
majority of EU/NATO member states that do not have such capacity. Two
fast-developing technological areas would be worth keeping track of.
First is the growing issue of cloud computing (and cloud backups) for
NATO and EU [cyber resilience]{.underline}. On the one hand remote
storage can help maintain digital continuity of operations in case of an
infrastructure disruption. On the other hand, clouds also have their
insecurities and the level of responsibility that private operators bear
for the security of their cloud still needs to be better defined. In any
case, cloud computing is increasingly finding its way into our everyday
lives, the EU--NATO Cyber Innovation Committee should look at better
cyber defense capabilities in this field. Second is the growing role of
automated information sharing in identifying relevant information more
quickly, but also in automating threat mitigation in real time.
Automated sharing of security and threat information could help the EU
and NATO to standardize their threat information. The Committee could
identify adequate information-sharing platforms that can withstand
increasingly complex attacks, based on open industry specifications.
Such platforms not only enable rapid communication and peer-based
sharing, they also [help reduce cost and increase the speed of cyber
defense]{.underline} by automating processes that are currently often
performed manually. Establish a Joint Working Group to Synchronize EU
and NATO Crisis Response Systems To date the existing capacity [to
synchronize EU and NATO cyber crisis response mechanisms]{.underline} is
limited. It involves formal and informal meetings between the North
Atlantic Council and the EU Political and Security Committee, exchanges
at ministerial meetings, cross briefings to respective Committees and
Councils, and informal staff-to-staff interaction, for instance between
the European External Action Service and NATO's International Staff. As
is true for all forms of collective response in the EU or NATO and
especially between the two, better and smoother cooperation in the case
of cyber crises would be needed. The EU cyber crisis response mechanisms
and NATO's Crisis Response System should be synchronized in order to
respond to major cyber incidents that affect multiple EU member states
and NATO Allies or EU/NATO institutions. The recent EU announcement of a
"blueprint" to respond to large-scale cybersecurity incidents invites
rethinking EU and NATO coordination on this issue. Hence, the EU and
NATO should consider establishing a [joint working group]{.underline} to
propose how to [synchronize]{.underline} their [systems]{.underline}. As
a first step, the Joint Working Group should develop a [common template
of crisis management]{.underline} phases through the full spectrum of EU
and NATO competencies for cyber aspects. The Joint Working Group could
also look at [clarifying responsibility at the national and
supranational levels, for issues like attribution or
countermeasures]{.underline}. Proposals should also be made on how to
synchronize joint strategic communication among EU and NATO
institutions. Finally, more concrete proposals could be developed for
using the EU Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) or NATO structures
to create national Cyber Defense Automated sharing of security and
threat information could help the EU and NATO to standardize their
threat information." " G\|M\|F December 2017 5 Policy Brief Rapid
Reaction Teams for supporting countries before, during, and after
crises. PESCO could provide the possibility of jointly funding rapid
reaction capacities for assisting member states in need. [Given the
existence of different crisis management tools that the EU and NATO have
at their disposal]{.underline}, [what is crucial now is to
align]{.underline} those [instruments]{.underline} and to work toward a
common EU--NATO playbook on how to react to cyber incidents and crises.
Develop a Peer-Assessment Process to Identify Key Resilience and
Capability Gaps Cybersecurity and defense are national responsibilities
of the EU and NATO member states, and the coordinating role at the
supranational level is still limited. The result is an uneven
preparedness among member states. The overall consequence of this gap,
since our systems are heavily interdependent, is less cybersecurity for
all. NATO has adopted the Cyber Defense Pledge that aims to improve NATO
Allies' national cyber defense capabilities in key areas. In parallel,
the EU Directive on the security of network and information systems (NIS
Directive) forces member states to adopt legal measures to boost the
overall level of their cybersecurity by May 2018. The timing may be
right to develop a peer-assessment process within NATO and the EU to
address key gaps in the cybersecurity and defense of NATO Allies and the
EU Member States. Given sensitivities around information sharing, such a
process would probably have to be voluntary to start, perhaps following
something of a PESCO model, but should aim to soon be broad and
comprehensive. The peer-assessment process would map functions of
essential services that are critical for the EU and NATO missions and
operations and for member states' national security, as well as their
cross-border and cross-sectoral interdependencies. The assessment would
produce check lists of vulnerabilities and suggested fixes in
participating EU and NATO member states, including their critical
economic sectors. One option, among others, [could be to use **common
funding** to assist]{.underline} those **[member states where serious
resiliency gaps have been identified]{.underline}**, or at minimum, [to
**facilitate voluntary assistance** from **more advanced nations** to
those who have **invested less in cybersecurity**]{.underline}. The EU's
Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) could enable member states to
transfer from a strictly voluntary resilience and defense
capability-building model to a [model of **binding
commitments**]{.underline}. The EU and NATO could also [strive, together
with]{.underline} able and willing [member states, to share best
practices and]{.underline} make concrete proposals on how to [improve
civil-military cooperation and public-private cooperation at the
national level.]{.underline}

Create a [Joint Cybersecurity Trust **Fund**]{.underline} to **[Build Up
Resilience of Partner Countries]{.underline}** [EU--NATO cybersecurity
and defense cooperation with partner nations is a win-win for all
sides]{.underline}. Partner [nations]{.underline} with the support of
the EU and NATO [can enhance their own technical cyber capabilities,
information networks, and standards]{.underline}, while [in
return]{.underline} these [partners]{.underline} will be able to [more
efficiently share with the EU and NATO their firsthand information,
expertise, and experience]{.underline}. Indeed, [the better the
technical capacity]{.underline} that partner [nations]{.underline}
[develop]{.underline}, [the more they can contribute]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} EU or NATO [collective cybersecurity]{.underline} and
defense. A [Joint]{.underline} [EU--NATO Cyber Trust Fund]{.underline}
should be [created to address the buildup of local skills,]{.underline}
[and enable]{.underline} **[stakeholders]{.underline}** in partner
nations [to attend]{.underline} EU or NATO cyber courses, seminars,
trainings and conferences, or to [organize]{.underline} similar types of
activities in their home land. The Trust Fund can also stimulate the
development of local skills by requiring at least one local partner or
support team to be involved in the project, rather than simply helping
European or American contractors export their technology to the partner
nations. The Joint EU--NATO Cyber Trust Fund should [encourage partner

Study the Adequacy of Cybersecurity and Defense Concepts and Strategies
EU or [NATO planning is inwardly focused]{.underline}, [revolving
around]{.underline} member states' [existing capabilities and
institutions]{.underline}, while their [adversaries]{.underline} often
**[plan]{.underline}** their **[capabilities]{.underline}**
**[around]{.underline}** the **[specific vulnerabilities]{.underline}**
of the actors they expect to confront. [Russian]{.underline} "[active
measures]{.underline}" [in Europe and North America, for
example]{.underline}, are designed to [exacerbate political tensions and
vulnerabilities]{.underline}, such as ethnic relations, regional
separatism, or socio-economic or cultural cleavages. In this manner,
Russia views the development of cyber capabilities as supporting a
broader set of conventional, hybrid, or nuclear capabilities. [In this
light, there is a real need for the EU and NATO]{.underline} --- or an
independent academic institution --- [to take a more outwardly focused
approach to studying]{.underline} the [cyber]{.underline}
[strategies]{.underline} and capabilities of NATO and the EU's potential
adversaries or competitors, [such as Russia or China]{.underline}, and
that puts in perspective the EU and NATO's own state of play in
cyberspace. Such an outward-looking approach toward cybersecurity and
defense could serve as a source of inspiration on how to improve EU and
NATO cyber strategy and capabilities. As a modern state-on-state
conflict is increasingly likely to begin in cyberspace, the EU and NATO
must think more actively which [cyber capabilities]{.underline} they
[must]{.underline} develop to [more effectively deter]{.underline} ---
or even retaliate against --- their [potential adversaries]{.underline}.
Develop EU--NATO Triggers for a Joint Response to Cyber-Attacks Leaders
in EU and NATO member states are getting more comfortable talking openly
about active and reactive joint responses to adversaries in cyberspace.
NATO has already recognized a serious cyber-attack as a potential
Article 5 trigger, and at its November 2017 defense ministerial, the
Alliance announced the creation of a Cyber Operations Center that will
facilitate the integration of cyber capabilities with conventional
military capabilities. But the current doctrine and crisis management
conditions enshrined in NATO and EU cyber policies still puts the
emphasis on a defensive posture only[. A clearer definition is
needed]{.underline} [of]{.underline} the circumstances, degree, and
manner in which active or counter-measures can or should be taken if
EU--NATO member states perceive a cyber threat or suffer a cyber-attack.
[The]{.underline} [authorization to use the **EU civilian toolbox**
or]{.underline} **[NATO offensive capabilities]{.underline}** may be
clear if a member state faces a large-scale, devastating cyber crisis.
**[The grey zones are a problem]{.underline}**. The
[Kremlin]{.underline} for instance has clearly been focusing its efforts
in the gray zone, and it has [gained]{.underline} some [sophistication
in avoiding]{.underline} lines that would trigger a common response from
EU or NATO member states. Russia is also not the only potential
adversary capable of similar tactics.6 [There is thus an acute need to
define when and how the EU and NATO must respond]{.underline} against
the day-to-day cyber intrusions that fall below the threshold of being
perceived as a clear act of aggression. 6 [For example]{.underline},
small to medium scale [cyber-attacks on critical
infrastructure]{.underline}, [hacking of sensitive information,
spreading of disinformation]{.underline}. The Kremlin has been focusing
its efforts in the gray zone, and it has gained some sophistication in
avoiding lines that would trigger a common response from EU or NATO
member states." " G\|M\|F December 2017 7 Policy Brief [The development
of a set of EU--NATO basic principles that would trigger a joint
response would be]{.underline} a [good]{.underline} first step. The
Tallinn Manual published by the NATO CCDCoE could offer inspiration on
how the EU and NATO can define these principles while respecting the
application of the international law.7 Currently [the EU and NATO
need]{.underline} to assess each individual cyber threat or cyber-attack
on a case-by-case basis without the support of [standard measurement
tools and indicat]{.underline}ors that can help them formulate a swift
and proportionate response. This considerably slows down the
decision-making process. Having a set of pre-agreed basic principles
would contribute significantly to efforts at improving reactiveness and
resilience at the EU and NATO levels.

Finally, for [EU-NATO cooperation in]{.underline} the field of
bolstering [resilience]{.underline} more steps [are needed]{.underline},
despite the progress that has been achieved since 2016. This is
underlined by a recent EP resolution on EU-NATO cooperation, which
highlights that, for example, "[efforts to create]{.underline} more
[synergies between civilian and military components,]{.underline} to
[advance common resilience]{.underline} and hence **[avert future hybrid
threats]{.underline}**"﻿[\[95\]](https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2021/countering-hybrid-threats/4-potential-for-future-eu-nato-cooperation-and-beyond/) are
necessary. Some even argue that, at present, the resilience strategies
of NATO and the EU are not sufficient in countering hybrid
threats.﻿[\[96\]](https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2021/countering-hybrid-threats/4-potential-for-future-eu-nato-cooperation-and-beyond/) Fortunately,
[resilience is an area]{.underline} [that has a **great deal of
potential**]{.underline} [for further cooperation between the EU and
NATO]{.underline}, mainly because **[this area is not]{.underline}** yet
very
**[politicised]{.underline}**.﻿[\[97\]](https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2021/countering-hybrid-threats/4-potential-for-future-eu-nato-cooperation-and-beyond/)

In general, more [effective counter-hybrid efforts would
require]{.underline} [tailor-made responses]{.underline}, an
[increased]{.underline} number of ([joint) scenario-building
exercises]{.underline} and a change of mindset from a reactive to a
proactive
approach.﻿[\[98\]](https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2021/countering-hybrid-threats/4-potential-for-future-eu-nato-cooperation-and-beyond/) In
addition, suggestions that have been outlined above to enhance
cooperation in the areas of crisis response and [cyber security and
defence]{.underline} will also contribute to enhancing cooperation in
the field of bolstering resilience. In particular, this refers to the
following suggestions: more regular organisation of joint counter-hybrid
exercises (with a specific focus on resilience); [a joint EU-NATO
taskforce for resilience building]{.underline}; [and
clarifying]{.underline} the [delineation of responsibilities between the
EU and NATO.]{.underline}

Another opportunity to enhance cooperation for the benefit of bolstering
resilience lies in disaster relief. During the corona pandemic, the ERCC
and the EADRCC have demonstrated that advanced cooperation is indeed
possible. The EU and NATO should build upon this experience. This should
start with exchanging best practices and lessons learned. This could
then be a solid foundation for and ease future cooperation. In addition,
the number of (joint) crisis management exercises could be expanded.
Such exercises should include those scenarios that test the resilience
of member states, including hybrid threats, cyberattacks and pandemics.
In case a real crisis would occur, the EU and NATO would already have an
idea of what is expected and which actions will be required.

In addition, bolstering resilience at the benefit of
[countering]{.underline} [hybrid threats entails more than merely
responding to immediate]{.underline} and sudden calamities and
[crises]{.underline}. [One should also take into
consideration]{.underline}, amongst other things, [general societal
resilience]{.underline}, the [resilience of critical
infrastructure]{.underline}, [protecting]{.underline} the stability of
[democratic systems]{.underline}, and financial and economic resilience.
To assess the potential role of the EU and NATO in these domains, [their
respective toolboxes]{.underline} should be analysed. In this regard, it
makes sense that [NATO will be responsible for enhancing]{.underline}
the resilience of the [critical (military) infrastructure]{.underline}
of its member states. In contrast, the [EU]{.underline} might be [better
equipped to promote resilience in the societal,]{.underline}
financial-economic and political [domain]{.underline}. Both
organisations should discuss the delineation of responsibilities in the
area of resilience.

#### Would use the Estonia model

**Zandee et al. 21**. Dick Zandee is Senior Research Fellow and Head of
the Security Unit of the Research department of the Clingendael

<https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2021/countering-hybrid-threats/> //BY

Additionally, [synchronisation between the EU and NATO]{.underline}
[response activities to cyber threats]{.underline}
[deserves]{.underline} more [attention]{.underline}. The EU and NATO
could discuss more concretely the delineation of responsibilities and
especially of military tasks with regard to cyber threats[:]{.underline}
when and how should the EU and/or NATO respond to actual cyber threats?
For example, a logical division of labour could be an [EU focus on
enhancing coordination and cooperation]{.underline} among its member
states [regarding]{.underline} the [protection of critical **civilian
digital infrastructure**]{.underline}, while [NATO concentrates on
enhancing coordination and cooperation]{.underline} among its member
states [concerning the protection of **military digital
infrastructure**]{.underline}. The focus for both organisations in this
regard should be both preventive (sharing threat analysis and protection
advice) as well as responsive (in case of actual cyberattacks). The
[development]{.underline} [of]{.underline} a set of [EU-NATO basic
principles]{.underline} or (non-binding) guidelines on what would
trigger a joint response would be a useful step as well. The
**[Tallinn]{.underline}** Manual published by the NATO Cyber CoE
**[could offer assistance]{.underline}** [on how to define these
principles]{.underline} while respecting the application of
international
law.﻿[\[93\]](https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2021/countering-hybrid-threats/4-potential-for-future-eu-nato-cooperation-and-beyond/) Some
experts advocate a common EU-NATO cyber strategy to better align EU-NATO
efforts in tackling cyber threats, but currently there seems to be
little support for this idea among the member
states.﻿[\[94\]](https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2021/countering-hybrid-threats/4-potential-for-future-eu-nato-cooperation-and-beyond/)

Bruno Lété, of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, also
[observes improved cooperation between EU and NATO in]{.underline} the
field of [cyber security]{.underline}. He states that "[Since neither
organisation]{.underline} [possesses]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
**[full range of capabilities]{.underline}** [to tackle contemporary
security challenges]{.underline}, **[there is a serious incentive for
the EU and NATO to cooperate]{.underline}** in times of crisis. And [in
the field of **cybersecurity** and defence]{.underline} the past few
years have indeed brought significant change. [The EU and NATO share
**many of the same priorities** in cyberspace]{.underline}, [their
policies are **largely identical**]{.underline} -- [based on the
principles of resilience, deterrence and defence]{.underline} -- and
[their tools are]{.underline} becoming increasingly
**[complementary]{.underline}**."﻿[\[74\]](https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2021/countering-hybrid-threats/3-eu-nato-cooperation-what-has-been-achieved-so-far/) Concerning
the successes of increased cooperation, Lété mentions exchanges between
staff on [concepts and doctrines]{.underline}, information on
[training]{.underline} and education courses, ad-hoc exchanges on
[threat assessments]{.underline}, [cross-briefings]{.underline},
including on the cyber aspects of crisis management, [and]{.underline}
an annual high-level EU-NATO staff-to-staff dialogue. He also highlights
the fact that since 2017 the [EU]{.underline} [and NATO flagship crisis
management exercises]{.underline} -- respectively called EU PACE and
NATO CMX -- [are being coordinated and held in parallel]{.underline}
with options for the mutual participation of EU and NATO staff.

<https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2021/countering-hybrid-threats/> //BY

However, an additional [way to improve information exchange]{.underline}
may be the following. In July 2021, the European Parliament (EP)
proposed the creation of a [common EU-NATO cyber threat information
hub]{.underline}, as well as a [joint EU-NATO Task Force for
cybersecurity]{.underline}, in order [to define and agree on collective
responses to cyber threats]{.underline}. The EP also called for stronger
coordination between the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) and the
NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence and for increased
EU-NATO coordination as regards establishing collective attribution for
malicious cyber
incidents.﻿[\[90\]](https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2021/countering-hybrid-threats/4-potential-for-future-eu-nato-cooperation-and-beyond/) A
recent Clingendael report also advocates [transforming the existing NATO
Cyber Centre of Excellence in Tallinn into a joint NATO-EU Cyber Centre
of Excellence]{.underline} that could [provide the main forum for
strategic discussions, joint training and
exercises]{.underline}.﻿[\[91\]](https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2021/countering-hybrid-threats/4-potential-for-future-eu-nato-cooperation-and-beyond/) Establishing
a completely new institution to further improve EU-NATO cooperation
regarding cyber threats does not seem very
beneficial﻿[\[92\]](https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2021/countering-hybrid-threats/4-potential-for-future-eu-nato-cooperation-and-beyond/),
yet exploring whether to [make existing organisations more
'joint']{.underline} might be worthwhile to further **[improve
information sharing]{.underline}**, staff-to-staff contacts, joint
workshops and exercises.

VILNIUS, Lithuania -- [Three Baltic nations]{.underline} are
laser[-focused on one goal]{.underline}: [defending their independence
and territorial integrity.]{.underline} [The chief of the]{.underline}
**[National Guard Bureau]{.underline}** [heard the same message in
visits]{.underline} to each country, part of a five-nation trip to
[recognize and strengthen **National Guard security cooperation**
relationships with]{.underline} Eastern European and **[Baltic
nations]{.underline}** threatened [in the wake of Russia's]{.underline}
brutal, unprovoked [invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. "I am here to
reinforce how important these partnerships are," Army Gen. Daniel
Hokanson said. "[Security cooperation is one of the most important tasks
the National Guard undertakes]{.underline} -- and these mutually
beneficial partnerships promote both the readiness and teamwork of our
respective military forces." Almost 30 years ago, a seed was planted in
the Baltics, a seed that grew beyond the imaginings of the visionary
leaders who nurtured it to become the 93-nation Department of Defense
National Guard State Partnership Program. **[In 1993, Estonia, Latvia
and Lithuania each partnered with a state National Guard, the first
three nations to join the nascent SPP]{.underline}**. [Three decades
on,]{.underline} [what started as individual relationships with
Maryland, Michigan and Pennsylvania is maturing into a regional
grouping]{.underline}: all three countries have access to the training
and capabilities of all three states and -- through them -- to the
expertise and resources of the 450,000-strong National Guard **[across
all 50 states]{.underline}**, [three territories and the District of
Columbia]{.underline}. "As the Baltic nations' military capabilities
have matured, so has each partnership," Hokanson said. [The SPP
contributed to each nation's preparations to join NATO]{.underline}.
Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian troops co-deployed multiple times to
Iraq and/or Afghanistan with their National Guard partners. [The SPP
continues to assist]{.underline} as each nation's armed forces
continuously improve their professionalism and modernize their military
equipment. Each nation is, of course, also unique: - Estonia is
**[particularly]{.underline}** strong **[in cyber
defense]{.underline}**, motivated by a 2007 Russian cyberattack that
crippled the entire country. It [hosts a NATO Cyber Defense Center of
Excellence]{.underline} and is the leading member of the alliance for
cybersecurity issues. [The Maryland National **Guard's Cyber Operations
Group**]{.underline} [has contributed to]{.underline} and learned from
the [Estonians]{.underline}. -- Conscription is still part of Estonia's
and Lithuania's military design; Latvia has an all-volunteer force. -
Estonia also hosts the Baltic Defence College, a joint, senior leader
military education institution. - Latvia hosts the NATO Center of
Excellence for Strategic Communications, a vital resource given Russia's
relentless misinformation campaign. - Latvia has a proficient Joint
Tactical Air Controller capability and was the first NATO country
outside the United States to develop JTACs. - In 1990, Lithuania became
the first Soviet Republic to declare independence, beginning the
collapse of the former Soviet Union. - In 2020, during the COVID-19
pandemic, Lithuania donated personal protective equipment to
Pennsylvania as a token of appreciation for their enduring partnership.
Each nation borders Russia and shares a painful history of Soviet
occupation. Today, Russians brutalize and kill Ukrainians, conduct mass
deportations and destroy towns with artillery -- the same tactics they
used in the Baltics in the 1940s. The three nations have generously
contributed to Ukraine's defense of its homeland and blocked Russian
media broadcasting in their countries. Ukrainian flags, posters, murals
and other displays of support are common in all three countries, and
some troops wear Ukrainian flags under their own flag on their uniforms.
During his visits to the three countries, Hokanson met with U.S.
ambassadors and the host nations' senior defense and military leaders.
He joined a roundtable discussion in Estonia at the Baltic Defence
College and toured [cyber defense operations]{.underline}. In Latvia, he
visited troops at the Adazi training center, including a multination
NATO division headquarters. "Ukrainians are defending our values,"
Hokanson was told during his visits. And he was told, "A Russian tank
killed in Ukraine won't come here: This is our war." And, "There is no
way we are going back \[to Russian domination.\] We would rather die
than go back." Hokanson reassured his counterparts about America's
ironclad commitment to its NATO allies and the National Guard's
commitment to its security cooperation partners. As if to underline the
point, while he was there, Vermont National Guard F-35 Lightning
multirole fighter jets streaked low along the Baltic coast on a NATO
mission defending the skies of Europe. If those who do not know history
are condemned to repeat it, that may explain the existence of the
Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania in Vilnius, which
Hokanson visited on the last day of his trip. The center is in a
building used first by the KGB, then the Gestapo during the Nazi
occupation, and then by the KGB again during the Soviet era. Visitors
can tour the cells where Lithuanians were held, tortured and executed.
Lithuanians died as recently as 1991: 23 killed and 900 wounded
defending the country's newfound independence. [Across the
Baltics]{.underline}, the stories handed down by past generations are
too horrific, and the memories of many still living too vivid to permit
complacency.

POLITICO Europe. BA in History @ Hampden Sydney College, MS in
Journalism @ Columbia. "THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACE ON EARTH",
https://www.politico.eu/article/suwalki-gap-russia-war-nato-lithuania-poland-border/)LR

[Despite the Baltics' strategic concerns, what may be the most dangerous
thing about the Suwałki Gap is its relative irrelevance]{.underline}. A
move by Russia on Poland or Lithuania would clearly trigger NATO's
Article 5 mutual defense provision, immediately pulling in all the
alliance's members --- from Turkey to Bulgaria to France and the United
States. At least in theory. How eager would Washington and NATO be to
risk Armageddon over a stretch of largely unpopulated farmland few of
their citizens even know exists? It's exactly the kind of edge case that
Putin has proved eager to test. Until (and if) Finland joins,
Lithuania's 900-kilometer border with Russia and Belarus is the longest
in the alliance. But with an army of just 20,000 and an air force with
only five planes including transport aircraft and one single-engine
Cessna, Lithuania, like its Baltic neighbors, is ill-equipped for a
Russian assault --- even with help from the German-led battle group
currently stationed in the country. [**"The only answer** to that
challenge is an **increased NATO presence** here," said Margiris
Abukevičius, Lithuania's vice minister of defense. "We know how Russia
is obsessed with closing land corridors."]{.underline} During a visit to
Vilnius earlier this month, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz tried to
reassure his hosts of Berlin's commitment to Baltic security but ended
up sowing confusion. Scholz told reporters that Berlin would move "in
the direction" of stationing "a robust combat brigade" in Lithuania,
implying several thousand troops would be deployed. [His aides later
walked back the comments, saying that Germany would only move the unit's
headquarters --- around 50 personnel --- there, while the majority of
the troops would remain in Germany. While the U.S.-led alliance has yet
to take a final decision, officials have signaled that NATO would
significantly bolster forces in the Baltics and elsewhere along the EU's
eastern frontier, heralding a historic shift in NATO posture and
shifting the pact's center of gravity to the east.]{.underline}
**[Though NATO has four 1,000-strong battle groups stationed across the
region, Baltic political leaders and military planners argue that much
more would be needed to deter Russian aggression.]{.underline}** "You
have a so-called trip-wire force, but you may as well call it a suicide
mission," said Ilves, who served as Estonian president from 2006 to
2016. The U.S. and Germany long cautioned against such a move, in part
because of a 1997 accord, known as the NATO-Russia Founding Act, in
which the alliance agreed with Moscow not to establish permanent bases
in new member states in "the current and foreseeable security
environment." Russia's attack on Ukraine, however, has convinced even
longtime skeptics of what NATO calls "forward defense" in Eastern Europe
that the time has come. "I've changed my mind," said Ben Hodges, a
retired American lieutenant general who commanded the U.S. Army in
Europe from 2014 to 2017. "Our good faith efforts to engage with Russia
have failed." In Belarus, over which Putin has recently asserted more
influence, the Russian military has recently used air bases and other
military infrastructure to launch assaults on Ukraine. Hodges said he
doubts whether Russia, which is struggling in Ukraine, could muster the
capabilities it needs to attack the Baltics for now. But he said it was
essential for NATO to use this opportunity to prepare for the worst,
including by bolstering the Baltics' air defenses and ensuring better
integration between local forces and the rest of the alliance. He said
he could envision a system with a "rotating permanent presence" of NATO
forces in the region, similar to how the U.S. operates in South Korea.
Another key factor in the region's defense is Poland, which has the
largest military in the region. Historic disputes between Poles and
Lithuanians in the Suwałki corridor over language and minority rights on
both sides of the border have led to speculation that Putin could use
those tensions to his advantage, similarly to his tactic in Donbas,
where he succeeded in harnessing pro-Russian sentiment to unleash a
separatist movement. That has yet to happen. Cross-border cooperation
between the Polish and Lithuanian militaries has never been closer,
according to General Rajmund Andrzejczak, Poland's top military
commander. "We see what the Russians are doing in Ukraine, so we don't
trust them," said the general, who once served in the Suwałki region,
stressing that Poland was prepared to honor its alliance obligations
towards Lithuania if Russia moves in. "We have to be very, very ready,"
he said.

FROM MANY, ONE Although the democracies currently suffer from a deficit
of cooperation, their capacity to work together endures. Here, history
offers useful guidance. In 1973, U.S. Treasury Secretary George Shultz
convened the finance ministers of France, the United Kingdom, and West
Germany in the White House library for informal talks. This "Library
Group" quickly added Japan to become the G-5 and later included first
Italy and then Canada to become the G-7. In the decades that followed,
this informal group of advanced liberal democracies, which for 16 years
included Russia as the G-8, would emerge as a powerful international
force. Among other issues, the group coordinated its members' responses
to 9/11 and to the 2008 global financial crisis. Just as the G-7 came to
guide multilateral action among the world's leading economies, a set of
techno-democracies---countries with top technology sectors, advanced
economies, and a commitment to liberal democracy---must take action on
contemporary digital issues. So far, these leading states have acted
independently, but their combined market power and national strength
would make them a potent unified force. For now, [[**12** countries
stand out for inclusion]{.mark} in such a group]{.underline}. [The
United States is]{.underline} arguably [still the world's leading
technological power, and **France**, **Germany**,
**Japan**]{.underline}, and [the **U**nited **K**ingdom]{.underline} all
have large economies and impressive technology sectors. [**Australia**,
**Canada**,]{.underline} and **[South Korea]{.underline}** have smaller
economies, but they are also important players in technology. The same
is true of [**Finland** and **Sweden**]{.underline}, which are
telecommunications and engineering powerhouses. [**India** and
**Israel** are]{.underline} also logical [candidates]{.underline} for
membership, [owing to the global reach of their flourishing technology
and startup sectors]{.underline}. [Given the **deep need** for
coordination among like-minded states, this "T-12" group of
techno-democracies would fill a **yawning gap**]{.underline} in modern
technological and geopolitical competition. The T-12's members would
undoubtedly disagree on many issues, but the group could provide a
critical venue for them to air their grievances. [The United
States]{.underline}, in particular, [should welcome the participation of
others, since their presence at the negotiating table would]{.underline}
not only [improve its digital advantage but also reduce the sense among
these countries that they are **merely pawns**]{.underline}, rather than
partners, in a U.S.-Chinese superpower competition. [[The **most
logical**]{.mark} [structure]{.mark} for the T-12 [is an **informal**
group]{.mark} of states, [not]{.mark} a secretariat-laden international
organization or [an alliance with a mutual defense
agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although critics often dismiss
gatherings such as the G-20 and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation as
once-a-year opportunities for heads of state to gather for a few hours,
don an ethnically unique shirt, jawbone, and take a group photo, this is
a misleading stereotype. [Such [groupings have]{.mark}]{.underline} in
fact [[been]{.mark} **[highly effective]{.mark}** [at marshaling
multilateral action]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the wake of 9/11, for
instance, G-8 summits produced specific commitments to prevent a repeat
attack. It is thanks to the actions taken then that modern commercial
aircraft have hardened cockpit doors, major international ports screen
cargo containers for dangerous materials, and nations restrict the
export of portable surface-to-air missiles. The G-8 was also at the
forefront of public health efforts. In 2001, the group established the
Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which has saved
millions of lives through investments in research and global health
programs. And after the 2008 financial crisis, the G-20 committed to a
\$5 trillion stimulus package and proposed new financial regulations,
helping contain the subsequent recession's damage and prevent another
crash. The government leaders or ministers who meet as the T-12 would
also have a unique opportunity to enlist the private sector and
international organizations in their work. Annual meetings could serve
as an arena for business leaders to join government officials in
coordinating responses to emerging issues such as the need to improve
remote-learning technology in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and what
the future of counterterrorism might look like. The format for these
meetings could include issue-based sessions, in which governments invite
leading private-sector figures for focused discussions, or standing
forums akin to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation's Business Advisory
Council, which provides advice to Pacific Rim leaders on concerns facing
businesses throughout the region. The T-12 could also develop working
groups and committees on the multistakeholder model, which brings
together representatives from business, civil society, government, and
research institutions. These groups would then pass recommendations up
to ministers and principals. Simultaneously, leaders could collaborate
with other multilateral organizations---working with NATO on AI
security, for instance, or with the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development on the industrial implications of disruptive
technologies. AN INITIAL AGENDA The success of the T-12 will inevitably
hinge on its ability to translate its conceptual appeal into the nuts
and bolts of executing a real agenda. One task its members could start
with is information sharing. Within the T-12, governments could update
one another on the security of supply chains, particularly in critical
sectors such as semiconductors, where China aims to dramatically reduce
the portion of the market currently controlled by American, Dutch, and
Japanese firms. They could conduct audits of supply chains that cross
international boundaries, especially those that include Chinese-made
components or software. Members could compare their assessments of the
risks of China's 5G technology, examine advances in quantum computing,
investigate AI safety, and share strategies for preventing the theft of
intellectual property. In a more ambitious step, they could exchange
information about online propaganda, disinformation, the integrity of
academic research, and specific ways in which autocratic regimes employ
technology to erode liberal democracy. [Setting standards for the use of
emerging technologies would be another crucial job for the T-12. The
countries and companies producing the most advanced technology have a
valuable first-mover advantage: they can set guidelines for how they
expect their products to be used. Facial recognition software would be a
good test case for the T-12's potential on this front.]{.underline} This
technology is already being used for surveillance purposes, including by
the Chinese government to monitor Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang and by
Moscow to link photographs with social media accounts. The leading
democracies have yet to agree on rules for using facial recognition
technology, including its proper role in the criminal justice system, or
the protocols that should govern data collection. The T-12 could address
this by exploring how such technology could be used to secure large
events or assist in law enforcement investigations, but not as a means
of social control or mass intimidation. Autocracies have realized that
technology is a central element of modern geopolitical competition.
Beyond helping the democracies get on the same page as they compete with
China, the T-12 could also serve as a way for members to air differences
within the group itself. Europeans might object, for instance, to the
fact that Israel's NSO Group, a controversial technology firm known for
its spyware products, sells smartphone surveillance tools to
autocracies, and the Americans may disagree with the EU's focus on
privacy when it infringes on free expression. The democracies have
varied approaches to data protection, privacy, and free speech. The T-12
would allow them to explore these differences, with the ultimate aim of
establishing broad principles, understanding disagreements, and
narrowing the gaps between participants. [Coordinating investments would
represent another natural function of the T-12. Members could
rationalize their allocation of resources to innovation and R & D and to
securing supply chains. They could even make concrete financial
commitments to counter China's Digital Silk Road and 5G capabilities and
launch joint projects in such areas as quantum computing, cybersecurity,
and tools for detecting AI-generated counterfeit images or videos known
as "deepfakes."]{.underline} In the realm of more speculative
technologies, it could examine advances in 3-D printing, potentially
unbreakable encryption methods based on quantum mechanics, and
microscopic sensing technology. More ambitious still, it might launch a
joint fund to extend loans and loan guarantees to developing nations
that seek trusted 5G equipment and other technology that accords with
liberal values. [Finally, the T-12 could serve as a forum for
coordinating policy. Members might harmonize their export controls on
cyber-surveillance tools; regulate the use of blockchain, a digital
ledger of global transactions, to ensure the integrity of supply chains
when it comes to sectors such as defense manufacturing and medical
equipment; generate common standards for a variety of 3-D printing
methods; and even coordinate their education and immigration policies to
develop and retain top technology talent. More broadly, the T-12 should
articulate a vision of the future based on innovation, freedom,
democratic collaboration, and liberal values.]{.underline} BIGGER AND
BOLDER [Over time, the T-12 could expand and transform, just as the G-5
became the G-7 and then, temporarily, the G-8. Starting with the initial
12, the T-12 should aim for around 20 members within five years.
Additional individual European states, such as Italy and the
Netherlands, could be asked to join, without the complexity of including
the European Union itself as a member. In Latin America, Brazil and
Chile would make obvious candidates, and in Africa, members could
include Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa. Taiwan would also be a useful
participant, even if creative diplomacy might be required to deal with
the island's nonstate status.]{.underline} The T-12's agenda should
similarly grow in ambition. Moving beyond its initial objectives, the
group could branch out into securing the supply chains for
semiconductors. Doing so would involve multilateral export controls on
semiconductor manufacturing equipment and technology, an area in which
the techno-democracies have a significant lead over China and others. As
part of this effort, they could create an international chip fabrication
consortium to move semiconductor production out of China and into a T-12
country and provide shared financing for the billions of dollars such a
move would require. And as the world faces diminishing returns in the
growth of computing power due to the physical limits of existing
materials, the group could launch joint R & D projects devoted to a new
generation of microelectronics that might jump-start an increase in
computing power again. Technology is too important to be left to the
technologists. As its portfolio grows, the T-12 should also take a
multinational approach to 5G networks. The current telecommunications
equipment sector is a Huawei-dominated oligopoly. This presents a major
supply chain and security risk, yet China's state subsidies make it
difficult for others to enter the market. The T-12 could support
non-Huawei companies, such as Ericsson, Nokia, and Samsung, as they
transition to using an open radio access network, or O-RAN, which relies
on open interfaces rather than proprietary equipment. This would allow
multiple vendors to supply the market with interchangeable
telecommunications components. In the future, it could collaborate on 6G
alternatives to Chinese hardware well before they are necessary, helping
avoid the very dilemma many economies are now facing with 5G. The T-12
could also develop the framework for a digital currency that preserves
the central role of the U.S. dollar in the global financial system. That
role is under threat. China's central bank is already piloting a digital
currency program. If the effort succeeds, China is likely to extend its
use to countries that participate in its Belt and Road Initiative,
expanding the renminbi's reach as an international medium of exchange
and possibly threatening the dollar's preeminent status. Pursuing a
secure digital dollar-based platform would level this playing field,
making it faster and easier to accomplish tasks such as moving money
between banks, trading oil futures, and tracking money laundering.
Beyond this, the T-12's members could develop and adopt a
cyber-deterrence doctrine. The world faces a perpetual threat from
cyberattacks, given the low barriers to entry and the difficulty of
attributing an attack to a defined actor. To tackle the threat, the T-12
could lay out uniform standards for appropriate behavior in cyberspace
and define what constitutes a proportionate response to a cyberattack.
Members could cooperate in detecting and measuring attacks by increasing
information sharing and establishing early warning mechanisms, then work
together to attribute violations to a particular aggressor. And once a
culprit is identified, the T-12 could coordinate a joint response.
ADDRESSING THE SKEPTICS Objections to a T-12 are easy to imagine. The
most obvious would be general opposition to any new international
grouping, which would join a raft of existing multilateral
organizations, some of which are obsolete. Yet [[the T-12's
**novelty**]{.mark} [is what makes it relevant]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[There is no group of]{.mark} **[advanced democracies]{.mark}** [to
coordinate tech]{.mark}nology policy]{.underline}: the G-7 leaves out
important technology leaders, and the G-20 includes the illiberal states
of China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. [[NATO is a **military**
alliance focused]{.mark} first and foremost [on]{.mark} **[European
security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark}
[Organization]{.mark}]{.underline} for Economic Cooperation and
Development, with 37 member states, [[is **too
large**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and lacks the track record to break ground
on technological issues]{.underline}. [[The T-12]{.underline}]{.mark},
by contrast, [[would bring together the **right
members**]{.underline}]{.mark} [while elevating technology to a level
commensurate with]{.underline} such issues as [European
security]{.underline} and global economic policy. The private sector's
role in a potential T-12 raises another question: Why would any business
participate in a government-driven process? The answer is that it would
make economic sense. Consider the inevitable restructuring and
geographic diversification of supply chains that will almost certainly
follow the coronavirus pandemic. Already, governments and firms are
considering reshoring pharmaceutical and medical device production, and
firms that are facing factory shutdowns due to the pandemic are
rediscovering the merits of diverse supply chains. Multilateral
coordination among national governments would make this process less
disruptive, costly, and lengthy than it would otherwise be.

[Then there is the likely reaction of China and Russia. Wouldn't a new
group of techno-democracies merely provoke them? Indeed, they probably
would treat it as a threat, but the cost of forgoing cooperation among
liberal democracies is far higher than the consequences of any pushback.
As the COVID-19 pandemic has proved, when liberal democracies fail to
work together, whether, in this case, in harmonizing travel
restrictions, employing disease-mitigation measures, or assisting poorer
nations, China benefits]{.underline}. [The T-12 should not ignore
illiberal states, and it can try to work with them on issues such as AI
safety or technological responses to climate change]{.underline}. But it
should tread carefully and limit their involvement. Ultimately, the
world will be safer, more stable, and freer if liberal democracies stick
together.

A final objection would be based on realism. Cooperation in other
fields---global health, say, or economic policy---is hard enough, and
the likelihood of building a successful body focused on technological
collaboration may be low. Indeed, one should not overstate the degree of
like-mindedness among any group of sovereign states, democracies or not.
But [that is a reason to experiment with new structures]{.underline} to
deal with tough problems, [rather than rely on]{.underline} either
**[outdated mechanisms]{.underline}** or an every-country-for-itself
approach. [The status quo is **not sustainable**]{.underline}. If the
democracies fail to act, technology will help shift the balance of
economic, military, and political power in favor of autocracies.

TIME FOR ACTION

In July 1944, [delegates of the Allied countries came together in New
Hampshire for what became known as the Bretton Woods conference. After
discussions of various technical issues and sweeping foreign policy
debates, the conference produced a blueprint for governing the postwar
international monetary and financial order. The Allies agreed on a
system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates, laid the groundwork for
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and embraced an open
international economic system. The framework designed then largely
remains in place today.]{.underline}

[Some of the most pressing technological issues facing the world's
democracies now may ultimately rival in importance the economic issues
considered by the Bretton Woods delegates. Just as in 1944, when the
United States and like-minded countries recognized that they could no
longer make economic policy in a vacuum, today they must recognize that
the time has passed when they can deal with the profound effects of
technology on their own]{.underline}. For too long, national approaches
to technological questions have been ad hoc, poorly coordinated, and
left to technology experts to sort out. But in today's competitive
global environment, technology is too important to be left to the
technologists.

#### More evidence

[At the outset of the digital age, democracies seemed ascendant. The
United States and like-minded countries were at the cutting edge of
technological development. Policymakers were pointing to the inherently
liberalizing effect of the Internet, which seemed a threat to dictators
everywhere. The United States' technological advantage made its military
more potent, its economy more prosperous, and its democracy, at least in
theory, more vibrant. Since then, autocratic states have caught up.
China is at the forefront, no longer a mere rising power in technology
and now an American peer. In multiple areas---including facial and voice
recognition,]{.underline} 5G technology, digital payments, quantum
communications, and the commercial drone market---it has surpassed the
United States. Leaders in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Venezuela,
and elsewhere are increasingly using technology for illiberal ends,
following China's example. And despite the United States' remaining
advantage in some technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and
semiconductor production, it has fallen behind China in formulating an
overall strategy for their use. Almost in parallel, the United States
and its allies have stepped away from their tradition of collaboration.
Instead of working together on issues of common interest, they have been
pulled apart by diverging national interests and have responded
incoherently to autocratic states' co-optation of new technologies.
Although officials in most democratic capitals now acknowledge the
profound ways in which new technologies are shaping the world, they
remain strangely disconnected from one another when it comes to managing
them. Coordination, when it occurs, is sporadic, reactive, and ad hoc.
[The liberal democracies are running out of time to get their act
together: whoever shapes the use of emerging technologies such as AI,
quantum computing, biotechnology, and next-generation telecommunications
will have an economic, military, and political advantage for decades to
come. But the world's advanced democracies have something the
autocracies don't: a long history of multilateral cooperation for the
benefit of all. Because the issues are so diverse, what's needed now is
not more piecemeal solutions but an overarching forum in which
like-minded countries can come together to hammer out joint responses.
This new grouping of leading "techno-democracies"---call it the T-12,
given the logical list of members---would help democracies regain the
initiative in global technology competition. It would allow them to
promote their preferred norms and values around the use of emerging
technologies and preserve their competitive advantage in key areas.
Above all, it would help coordinate a unified response to a chief threat
to the global order.]{.underline} AUTOCRACIES IN THE LEAD Washington has
struggled to develop a coherent vision to guide its global technological
role, but many autocracies have not. China, in particular, has
recognized that the existing rules of the international order were
largely written in a predigital age and that it has an opportunity to
write fresh ones. Already, Beijing is pursuing this goal by quickly
building top-notch capabilities and deploying them throughout the global
market, especially in areas where the U.S. presence is weak or virtually
nonexistent. In Zimbabwe, for instance, the Chinese AI company CloudWalk
is helping develop a national facial recognition system, giving the
local government a powerful new tool for political control. [But
forward-looking efforts such as these are not solely unilateral. China,
Russia, and other autocracies are already coordinating around a
self-interested global vision. They are shaping standards for the use of
new technologies in exclusive groups such as the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization, whose members have agreed to collaborate on information
security, robotics, and e-commerce, among other areas. They also work
through global forums such as the International Telecommunication Union,
where some of the same countries have supported international standards
that facilitate unaccountable surveillance. Unlike many liberal
democracies, quite a few autocracies have realized that technology,
including the power to innovate, set norms for its use, and shape the
institutions that decide how it will be employed, is not simply a niche
functional issue buried in a crowded foreign policy agenda; it is a
central element of modern geopolitical competition.]{.underline} The
United States, on the other hand, has been mostly reactive. China's
rapid progress in 5G, AI, and quantum communications has stumped
multiple U.S. administrations. Washington has no easy answer to China's
so-called Digital Silk Road, an array of technological infrastructure
projects to accompany the construction projects of its Belt and Road
Initiative, nor does it have an answer to the country's campaign to
establish a digital currency. The United States and its allies have
consistently struggled to define the rules of engagement around
cyberattacks and have responded inadequately to the use of technologies
by autocracies to oppress their people. U.S. officials often complain
about Beijing's dominance in technical standard setting and allies'
deferential attitude toward Chinese infrastructure. But they have had a
difficult time changing the nature of the game. [The T-12 would help
democracies regain the initiative in global technology competition. This
is a multinational failure. Liberal democracies around the world simply
do not work together on many of the issues that should unite them. Their
responses to autocracies' abuse of technology tend to be fragmented.
National interests diverge, disagreements among states arise, and
nothing gets done. Within countries, paralysis often occurs as domestic
authorities clash with their national security counterparts over how to
deal with election meddling, disinformation, and hacking. Instead of
pursuing broad collaboration, the liberal democracies have come up with
a patchwork of discrete responses: Canada and France's collaboration on
an expert panel tasked with monitoring developments in AI policy, for
example, or NATO's pursuit of a cyber-deterrence doctrine.]{.underline}
The dispute over the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei's 5G
capabilities is perhaps the best example of democracies' inconsistent
response. Following Australia's initial lead, the United States took a
hard line against the company, banning Huawei components from its
national 5G network and forbidding U.S. entities from doing business of
any sort with it. The United States proceeded to insist that other
democracies follow suit, even threatening to withhold critical
intelligence from allies if they adopted Huawei products. Still,
Washington remains relatively isolated in its opposition. Many
governments continue to resist U.S. pressure, pointing out that there is
no low-cost, one-stop-shop alternative to Huawei's technology. Even
Canada and South Korea, close U.S. allies, have defied Washington and
are considering Huawei equipment for their 5G infrastructure. [The
democracies have come up with a **similarly disjointed**]{.underline}
response to Russia's election meddling. Although the Kremlin has
interfered in the elections of multiple countries, the problem has
largely been treated as a national one, deserving of only a unilateral
response from any given target. When Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S.
presidential election, only the United States responded with punitive
measures. Likewise, Russia's reported meddling in this year's U.S.
presidential election has so far not produced any unified reaction.
Compare that to the response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and its
poisoning of a former intelligence officer and his daughter in the
United Kingdom. In those cases, the major democracies coordinated a
joint response, imposing new sanctions and expelling Russian diplomats.

This study represents the first attempt to clearly document the negative
economic outcomes of Russian disinformation within the Baltic States.
Such adverse effects were assumed (Molder & Sazonov, 2020), though not
yet proven. We discovered that [[a]{.mark} **constant
[narrative]{.mark}**]{.underline} from various information sources
[[related to the **imminent nature** of military action]{.mark} in or

countries through the reluctance of their citizens to invest in their
domestic economies. The erosion of **[[trust]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
the Government also may have far-reaching implications, including an
indirect effect on the economy. [The Baltic States are]{.underline} also
[lagging behind other]{.underline} EU [Member States in terms of
**vaccination**]{.underline} against COVID-19. [This has also been
attributed by some experts to **skepticism**]{.underline} toward
government actions (Genys & Krikstolaitis, 2021). Lower vaccination
rates lead to longer and stricter economic lockdowns, higher spending on
treatment of infected persons, etc. [[Weakened trust

[[Lithuania]{.underline}]{.mark}, compared to Western States, [[leads
to]{.mark} greater [reluctance]{.mark}]{.underline} of the part of the

has the]{.mark} **[highest rate]{.mark}** [of suicide among European
countries]{.mark}]{.underline} (Zalsman et al., 2017).

This study additionally confirmed the strong relationship between the
perception of justice within the country and trust in the Government.
Although it is considered a prerequisite for a strong democracy
(Kashwan, 2017), many [[countries]{.underline}]{.mark} still [[have
failed to ensure **social justice**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Lee, 2021).
The relationship between perceived career possibilities and trust in the
Government indicates a high level of paternalism in Baltic States'
societies, where the governments are expected to display a significant
level of care, possibly taking responsibilities that are typically met
at the individual level, e.g., career development (Vande Griek et al.,
2020).

[[The **perceived threat of war**]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is one of
the main leitmotifs of the Russian disinformation campaign targeting in
the Baltic States (Saxi et al., 2020), [[is]{.mark} both found to
