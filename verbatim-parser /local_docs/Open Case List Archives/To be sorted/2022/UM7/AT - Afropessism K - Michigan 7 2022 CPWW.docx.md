gamEdze: Just to clarify, ["[shutdown]{.mark},"]{.underline} as we refer
to it, was (or [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}) [a tactic [used by]{.mark}
Black [students at]{.mark} **South African
[universities]{.mark}**]{.underline} that emerged mainly during
#feesmustfall in October [2015]{.underline} and has been used since then
in 2016 and 2017. [The plan was to stop the university from operating
and make it impossible for it to continue with business as
usual.]{.underline} Arrest its academic program, hold it ransom, and
pressure the management to agree to certain demands that were part of a
much larger call for decolonization, which I suppose is what we are
dealing with in this collection of texts. The end of outsourced labor
and the call for free education have been the main material demands that
somewhat unify the national shutdown periods, but the nature of the
campaign and the broader demands depended a lot on students' educational
and political processes at the various campuses.

gamedZe: Of course ["[shutdown]{.mark}" [is not]{.mark} a **[new]{.mark}
revolutionary strategy**; it has been used all over the world in
different ways in different spaces]{.underline}. In our context we might
see it as an extension, transplantation, and a micro-[referencing of the
anti-apartheid strategy of "ungovernability"]{.underline} that
proliferated in the townships [in 1980s South Africa]{.underline}. After
1994 there have been instances of Black students adopting a similar
strategy, but until "mustfall," the notion of shutdown had not taken on
a "national" character.

In recent years, [[different campuses adopted different]{.mark}
**strategic [approaches]{.mark}** to shutting down. Some movements
embarked on a **live shut-down**]{.underline}, moving class by class,
rendering lectures and tutorials that were in operation impossible,
triggering fire alarms, and mobilizing other students as they went.
[Others embarked on more **preventative shutdowns**]{.underline},
attempting to make it impossible for university to even begin, by
[barricading campus entrances with bins, bodies, and burning
tires.]{.underline} These barricades and protest lines, the frontiers of
"shutdown," were met with extreme physical violence from the state
police and hired private security forces. This violence--- unimaginative
masculinist aggression---provoked a response from students, which
generally took on the mirrored form of masculinist resistance. Or at
least, this was the newsworthy narrative, because, as disturbing as it
is, we know that mainstream media has an unending masochistic capacity
to absorb images of Black people being brutalized.

The image of the violated black body has strong ties to the politics of
the Afropessimist. We feel that through the cycle of protest and violent
repression, which continually produces and reproduces black people as
"socially dead," Afropessimism has fed deeply into the ways we think
about protest.

gamEdze: I want to get a bit deeper into what you're saying here,
because I think [[it's]{.mark} **really [important]{.mark}** [to
consider the]{.mark} **complex and somewhat [contradictory]{.mark}**
[role of Afropess]{.mark}imism **[in]{.mark} student
[movements]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I'm interested in how these politics
have been instrumentalized in the service of "shutdown" protests, as
well as the ways that the ideology which informs political strategy
plays into and is given life in the internal world of the movement.
Before I get into the Afropessimism thing, though, let me set it up with
an initial statement or belief that I hold.

[We are all externally vulnerable to the violence of capital-driven
time-space, and so it is the politics through which we live that can
potentially offer us healing or, on the other hand, can **exacerbate the
problem**]{.underline}.

A therapist once explained to me that anxiety and anger are place-holder
emotions, and what she meant is that in order to explore the causes of
our anxiety and anger and potentially soothe them, we must seek a place
that is more internal, and perhaps less easy to understand and manage.
This internal place is often one of deep sadness, and fear can render us
reluctant to explore it. Thus anxiety and anger function to express our
incapacity to manage the depth of ourselves in a given situation---they
are ways the body defends and manages circumstances that hurt and can
possibly damage us. Sadness, on the other hand, is a kind of giving up
of the body to its own incapability to be okay---an abandonment of
reactive behaviors to violent parameters, and an acceptance of a
boundless present of despair. It is raw and difficult, but the
experience of pain or sadness is often what allows us to come to terms
with pervasive dissonances between our own spirit and the ways we are
vulnerable to, and complicit in, the mismanagement of people in the
world. My interest is in how our politics can contribute to, hinder, or
interact with our emotional life, and how this has played out in the
bits and pieces of the shutdown processes we know about.

gamedZe: That's really interesting, [thinking about the notion of a
"**place-holder politics**"]{.underline} and their emotional
corollaries. I wonder if [it's useful here to get into Afropessimism, or
at least how we saw, understood, and experienced it **within student
movement spaces**]{.underline}?

gamEdze: For sure, go ahead.

gamedZe: As I see it, briefly, [[Afropess]{.mark}imism is one
**political lens**, set of ideas, or a vocabulary that [has
found]{.mark} **significant [traction]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} certain
**[student]{.mark} movement [spaces]{.mark}**. [This]{.mark} traction
[has brought]{.mark} with it [a]{.mark} particularly [**nihilistic
approach** to protest]{.mark}. It could be interesting to think through
this tendency toward protest along with some of the ideas you have set
up]{.underline}.

gamEdze: Yes, so Afropessimism defines itself through understanding the
world's fundamental structure as "antiblack," and thus sees black people
as perpetually negated or "socially dead" and so absent from any
conception of humanity.

gamedZe: Uh huh. And [[it seems to **flatten**]{.mark} **out and
homogenize** Black people, **reducing and owning** the interpretation of
**[Black]{.mark} peoples' [experiences]{.mark}** [by]{.mark}
subordinating them to one supposedly absolute and [totalizing]{.mark}
logic]{.underline}.

gamEdze: It goes further by articulating that the maintenance of
antiblackness is crucial in sustaining the psychic health of white
people. In other words, the binary created through the construction of
blackness versus whiteness is the logic through which white people are
able to recognize themselves as human, and through which black people,
too, see white peo¬ple as human, and negate themselves. While
Afropessimism can be useful in identifying systems of power---for
instance, the mutual relationship of the racist construct of "black
people as criminals" with the legal system and the capitalist
prison-industrial complex---it falls short itself by asserting that
there exists no other state for the black body except perpetual death,
so con-sistently caving in on itself.

gamedZe: So, in that, it fails on many levels to make sense of the
nuanced ways in which people, despite their supposed nonexistence, exist
in and navigate through the world. How does Afropessimism understand its
social death in relation to queerness or disability---forms of otherness
that also generate gratuitous violence, exclusion, and oppression? But
also, this particular transplantation of the American thing (the origin
of the school of thought) to the continent is pretty wack. Even as the
Black radical tradition has largely been formulated and theorized in and
from America, and even as it often falls prey to American
exceptionalisms in its quest for forms of Black universalism, I think it
holds radical potential for us on the continent. As many theorists and
thinkers of the Black radical tradition have shown, African cultural
practices have formed the basis of Black revolt across time and space. I
see Afropessimism as a departure from that tradition's dynamic
foundations in African culture.

Afropessimism, through its fixation on natal alienation, tends to ignore
the living connections to the continent, seeming to take the severance
of African people from the continent through the middle passage as utter
and complete. It therefore seems to understand Black people not as
cultural subjects who brought entire cosmological worlds and practices
with them but as hopeless, utterly dislocated beings only existing as
the sum total of their position in white supremacy. While I think that
this can be challenged even in a diasporic context, this contradiction
is even more pronounced here on the continent, because although many of
us are alienated from African cultural practices and contexts, those
traditions persist and are more or less proximate whether or not one is
immersed in them.

gamEdze: In this way, it can be difficult to move with the
Afropessimist, whose American-specific engagement with a particular
history defines the functioning of antiblackness, seen as a mechanism
that forms the foundational reality of every scenario of oppression.

Afropessimism's refusal to engage its own internal world, to abandon its
reactive and defensive nature, leads me to imagine it as a "placeholder
politics," similar to the ways that anxiety and anger hold and protect
us from entering the place existing beyond them. This is not to offer a
clean critique on Afropessimism but to situate it as a politics that
perhaps exists as external to something more effective in exploring and
acknowledging the internal--- the power and the pain.

Afropessimism finds no way to its own sadness.

gamedZe: The idea of "holding" the "place" is quite a nice one. And
interesting to think about how, in relation to the continent, it is
perhaps the anxiety or the anger of Afropessimism that holds the place
that prevents or protects the descent into the deep sadness. Perhaps
this is what Fred Moten (2003: 94), through Amiri Baraka, might refer to
as "the tragic," which "is always in relation to a quite particular and
material loss," in this case being "the impossibility of a return to an
African, the impossibility of an arrival at an American, home." The
sadness of the tragic is too great.

gamEdze: Heavy \...

[Let's move back, or forward to the **[student movement]{.mark}**, where
[we have seen Afropess]{.mark}imism function [in]{.mark} a **number of
[different ways.]{.mark}** Because of the diverse and chaotic mixture of
political ideologies under the "mustfall" umbrella,
[Afropess]{.mark}imism, like other politics, has been a collaborator,
[mixing]{.mark} sometimes productively, but often [aggressively, with
other]{.mark} political **[schools]{.mark} in the space**, such as
**Black feminism, Marxism, and Charterism**.]{.underline}

No one ever decided that "mustfall" would adhere to a single way of
navigating, and thus we could find ourselves having to hold a number of
contradictions, jumping between politics as we navigated the trauma of
the external, and the ways we chose to deal with emotions of the
internal. In this way, sometimes the reactive nature, [the **anxiety and
anger** of the placeholder politic of Afropessimism, functioned to hold
the outsides, as different political ideas played out on the inside of
the shutdown.]{.underline} I know that this thought experiment seems far
neater than the muddiness of any reality of shutdown and occupation
could possibly be. But we are using it because as far as we both
critique Afropessimism, the way it has catalyzed in the mix of mustfall
politics seems to have opened it up to something beyond its own
imagination. On the outside, [[Afropess]{.mark}imism [leads]{.mark} to a
style of [protest]{.mark}, to a **style of retaliation**, [to a mode of
policing]{.mark}, to a **[steering away]{.mark} of movements**
[from]{.mark} initial [strategy, to]{.mark} [individualized acts
of]{.mark} **embodied [resistance]{.mark}** to the law.]{.underline}

gamedZe: On the barricades, [[forced into the **form**]{.mark} **of
protest** [that the **state**]{.mark} **and security** [is
**prepared**]{.mark} **and equipped** [for]{.mark}---**violent
confrontation**---[there is no possibility of Afropessimism
evolving]{.mark} into anything else [because we run into the
**militarized trap**]{.mark} set for us, with no possible
escape.]{.underline}

gamEdze: On the inside, [in the temporary "safety" offered by a
successful shutdown, is the place where we can create.]{.underline}

gamedZe: That kinda comes back to what I think of as a classic
revolutionary dialectic, of reaction and creation. It raises the
question: was it necessary to react in that way in order to create?
[[Did we have to adopt]{.mark} this **[nihilistic politics]{.mark}** and
**dangerous bodily mode of protest** to [shut down the space such that
we can then explore other possibilities]{.mark}]{.underline}?

gamEdze: This is such a fundamental question, and I personally don't
necessarily think so. [[Afropess]{.mark}imism to a large extent really
**[upset]{.mark} the growth** of [Black fem]{.mark}inist
[thought]{.mark}]{.underline}, at least in the shutdowns I have been
involved in. Instead of providing an entry point into various political
schools, black feminism---particularly intersectionality---seemed
optional, forming just one of several political collaborators within the
shutdown space. [This approach was often read by Afropessimism and even
black consciousness as an aggressor, or a **"distracting" force** within
the movement. But [intersectionality makes **collective work**
possible.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Audre Lorde, much in keeping with intersectionality, is insistent on
conscientizing difference, so that it escapes its usual trap of
exploitation by the status quo. This approach to making activism is a
depthy internal process of instrumentalizing and weaponizing one's pain
and power toward collective struggle (Audre Lorde 2012). It is in direct
conflict with Afropessimism, which begins and ends through the arrest of
blackness in singular form: a circular anxious reasoning that cannot
explore its particularities and intersections, and so finds its
imagination short-circuited by the binary understanding of power only
through white supremacy.

If Afropessimism went to therapy, it might find, beneath its repeated
anxious mantra of social death, a network of connected histories that
have created layers and layers of power and oppression. This painful
conscientization is the beginning of a process of shaping tools that can
be used to transcend the defensive limitations of placeholder politics
and can, rather, soothe the internal while launching a fiery attack on
the oppressor. Lorde's tool was poetry. And ours right now is this.

gamedZe: I'm thinking now of some of Toni Morrison's work and how one
gets a real sense from her stories, that, despite the horror, violence,
and the trauma of racism, Black people have, and have always had,
stories outside white terrorism. Not that the terror is ever fully
absent, but she makes a political decision in her writing to center
Black people rather than white supremacy, opening up different creative
and political potentialities. Although one of her starting points might
be a critique of racism, it is not her endpoint. And I think what we are
interested in thinking about in relation to shutdown is the
possibilities that open up when the campus is claimed and the spaces,
under new management, have not yet been purposed. When you occupy a
house successfully, what do you do in the house? If we are able to
arrest the university, what kinds of potentialities emerge?

gamEdze: And further, to extend your question, [[if]{.mark} a particular
mode of [protest]{.mark} that [is **exclusionary** is]{.mark} used in
"shutting down" or [securing the space, does this mean that the]{.mark}
inevitable [political landscape]{.mark} [within that space is limited to
this]{.mark} political [tendency]{.mark}]{.underline}? Considering that
the act of barricading requires a certain kind of bodily intervention
which is often masculinist and exclusionary, [[can an
Afropess]{.mark}imistic-[led shutdown]{.mark} secure and [open the space
for]{.mark} an intersectional [collectivity]{.mark} and loving place of
study]{.underline}?

gamEdze: The connection is that a masculinist, exclusionary, body-based
rupturing of space will easily lead to an exclusionary group
consciousness that occupies spaces using the same guiding principles it
did to secure that space, unless tasks are explicitly divided using an
intersectional approach to plan for the people involved. It is well
documented, although poorly publicized, that "mustfall" in most
instances failed to challenge institutionalized ableism and built-in
inaccessibility at South African universities, as much as it did racism,
classism, and patriarchy.

gamedZe: [[Where the work happened well, it seemed to]{.mark}
temporarily allow for a **[reconfigur]{.mark}ing of
[relationships]{.mark}** and roles insisted on [by the
university]{.mark}. For instance, the mobilization, organizing, and
study that happened around the "OutsourcingMustFall" opened up [new ways
of relating between **"workers" and "students."**]{.mark} These
relationships were shifted, [through **organizing together** and
resisting white institutional order]{.mark}, from the rigid and distinct
categories of the university, to being resituated within the framework
of the Black family. In certain instances Black students spoke about
workers as "our mothers and fathers" and workers related to students as
"our children." [This was a **radical departure** from]{.mark} the way
that [the institution was intentionally curated]{.mark}, where to be a
student means to have gained access to a world of more privilege than
that rewarded for physical labor]{.underline} (for a further discussion,
see Motimele, in this issue).

Following on from the Black family, what I think shutdown allowed for in
its most generative expression was the possibility of a different way of
being together. [And interestingly, it was the possibility of a
different way of being together and being at the university. [The
university was what was]{.mark} being [shut down]{.mark}. Its normative
mode of functioning was arrested. So in certain senses [it was about not
being at the university]{.mark}, because the university represents [a
space of not-being-together]{.mark}, or at least only being together in
particular ways that are shaped and governed by notions of difference
and hierarchy---ways that operate to preclude or prohibit
collectivity]{.underline}.2 In that sense shutdown ruptured the
university, using it as a site for anticapitalist experiments with/in
time and space.

Some might say that that rupture forms a prefigurative moment---a
prophetic enactment of a utopian future that is still, yet, or perhaps
to come. Perhaps shutdown forms opposition to the obstacles blocking us
from our true social nature?

Shutdown and the space of occupation didn't, in any definitive or
over-bearing way, stop the university being what it is. Even when these
spaces were alive, while they might have been able to arrest and
repurpose certain functions or buildings, they were only pockets or
time-space capsules casting fleeting shadows on the hegemon's place in
the sun. But what we know to be true is that spaces of study and
planning have always, at every historical moment, been casting shadow.

gamEdze: Yes, and [I think that this is important, too, with our
conversation around Afropessimism, which seems to assume that validity
only exists in the hegemonic]{.underline}, where the nuances,
characters, and textures of everyday social moments are seen to hold no
radical value in resistance politics. [Can Afropessimism make sense of
the reality that no matter how you look at it, we are here, we are
working, and we are of value to one another]{.underline}?!

gamedZe: Since its conception of the world seems so thoroughly and
hopelessly centered on whiteness, [[Afropess]{.mark}imism [seems unable
to value the spaces between]{.mark} us as [Black people]{.mark} and what
we are able to create together]{.underline}. These collective spaces are
only considered important within a "prefigurative frame," as if they are
enactments of the future we imagine in the present. [Afropessimism seems
to imply that the only possible way for it to value Black life would be
following an absolute rupture, the moment of the end of the world, in
other words, supposedly the cataclysmic end of whiteness. Afterward,
everything is assumed to be different.]{.underline}

gamEdze: Yes. [[The]{.mark} potential for [imagination in
Afropess]{.mark}imism [is dire]{.mark}.]{.underline} I'm also not very
invested in the notion of prefigurative politics, but my main
uncomfortability with it is concerned primarily with the "figure" in
"prefigurative" because this presence seems to allude to the
"[endpoint]{.underline}," or the future as existing in resolved and
recognizable form. [I find that concept to be itchy because this
preoccupation with a figure and with a Western time
constraint]{.underline} (implied in pre-) [limits imagination to a
linearity involved in making a finished thing.]{.underline} What we know
is that radical work unapologetically occupies the present, and that
"presents" are always in the process of realizing and shifting
themselves, reluctant to stay seated or be neatened up as finished
figures or symbols attesting to the triumph of an era. This image, or
"figure," sounds oddly like "democracy" and its various symbolic
manifestations in post-1994 South Africa---the very era that has led us
to these shutdowns in the first place. We should not shut down the
possibility that if the "figure" of prefiguration exists, she should
operate in motion, without certainty, and always be too present to
capture.

gamedZe: I mean, where do you get your bars from? Damn. But beyond your
bars, if I think about revolutionary movements on the continent, the
historical imagination always suggests that a radical act in the
present, even if it is a prefiguration of a desired future, it is also a
postfiguration of a sometimes romanticized but nonetheless remembered,
recollected past. I recall Cabral's concept of the "return to the
source"---the cultural/political movement of an alienated people away
from the values and practices of the colonizer in the search and pursuit
of those of their people, historically, the basis of the future society.
We see this Cabralian impulse in God's Bits of Wood, where Ousmane
Sembène (1960) talks about what railway workers and their families did
when they arrested capitalist time during the great 1947--48 Dakar-Niger
railway workers' strike. Sembène (1960: 75): "Ceremonies that went back
to time immemorial were revived, and pageants that had long been
forgotten. Men armed with staffs or cudgels performed the saber duels
whose ritual dated back from the reign of El Mami Samori Touré. Women
dyed their hands and their feet with henna enriched with the black of
burnt rubber and coloured their lips with antimony." There was a return
to the source and a reinvigoration of the imperative to be in
historically rooted motion, and it was the impossible time-space pocket
wrought open by the strike's initiation that made the cultural movements
possible even as they existed in a broader context of colonial
domination.

Similarly, [[if we think about shutdown as a]{.mark} parallel
[strategy]{.mark}, **Black [students]{.mark}** [shut the university
down]{.mark}, and then we didn't have to just be students. In that
time-space we could be artists, intellectuals, African people, friends,
comedians, musicians, writers, dancers, actresses, and [we could be
together]{.mark}. People were able to collectively create, learn, tell
stories, teach, rap, laugh, cry, and sing in occupation in ways that I
had never seen or even imagined in my almost ten years at and on the
fringes of the university.]{.underline} It's as if that arrested space
allowed us to return to our true (following Marx to our social)3 nature;
it allowed us to return to ourselves, to be with our internal world, and
that means singing (being) together as a people.

**Rejecting the white society requires agential capacity through the

agency and political power. Only debate -- through discourse -- can

[To belong to [the future]{.mark}]{.underline}, however,
[[entails]{.mark} a [rejection]{.mark} [of a]{.mark}n **isomorphic
[relationship]{.mark}** [between]{.mark} European/[white and
modern]{.mark}]{.underline}. Where this is so, it means the construction
of other forms of temporal belonging. [[For blacks, this would
mean]{.mark} a **paradoxical transformation** from black to Blacks. The
first accepts the impasse; the latter, as transcending it, [regards the
**future as a commitment** to be made]{.mark}. In effect, [that requires
being **agents of history**]{.mark}, which means, then, that within
blacks would become the possibility of Blacks.]{.underline} This
argument is thus a demand for Black modernity. As any group who makes
such moves effectively constitute its possibility, modernity would be
decoupled from Europeanness and whiteness through an appeal to
modernities. That would make Euromodernity one among many possibilities
for the human condition. It would also mean identifying the extent to
which, in making itself isomorphic with modernity, Euromodernity is a
theodicy and, ultimately, a historic expression of la mauvaise foi.
[[This]{.mark} understanding of taking on the responsibility for
building a future [can]{.mark} also [be read as]{.mark} **practices of
[liberation]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It is an important feature of Black
existential philosophy as offered by such philosophers as Biko, Birt,
Fanon, Henry, Jones, Manganyi, and More, among others, as well as those
in the literary existential traditions, including James Baldwin, Paula
Marshall, Toni Morrison, and more. There are many elements of these
thinkers' writings pertaining to existential phenomenology; for example,
each offers meditations on embodiment and the social impact on
comportment. There are, as well, their detailed interrogations of
oppression. What I offer here is just a hint. [To close, there is one in
particular on which I would like to offer some consideration. None of
what I have argued makes sense without power. Unfortunately,
[the]{.mark} contemporary [circumstance is one in which]{.mark}
political [discussions]{.mark} of power [are dominated by]{.mark} two
opposing views, both of which are premised on a reductive idea based
primarily on the Anglo line of [Euromodernity]{.mark}. It comes down to
this: the right exercise it, while the left shun, at times even seem
allergic to, it[. This is because of the focus on coercive power
in]{.mark} contemporary [political life]{.mark}. The reasons for doing
so aren't entirely misguided.]{.underline} After all, what are
colonialism, enslavement, and racism but abuses of power? Enrique Dussel
observed that the effort to articulate the underlying grammar of
Euromodernity as the Cartesian triumph of epistemology veils its
underlying history of conquest. Instead of "I think, therefore I am,"
the truth was actually "I conquer, therefore I am."22 Sartre's influence
in Black existentialism This is patently the triumph of Hobbesianism,
where in the hypothesized war of all against all, order is restored
through the emergence of peace-establishing might. In this model, power
is what is imposed, and its expansion in studies of class, engenderment,
race, and sexual orientation includes ideas on interpellation. Naming
becomes a sovereign beneath which suffer the named. Yet, as we have
seen, what is imposed and what is lived are not identical. As with other
phenomena, power could collapse into a theodicy, which reeks of la
mauvaise foi. Where ill defined, power becomes a form of closure. It
erases options, and in so doing becomes so claustrophobic that choice
seems to disappear. We should, however, remember the insight on la
mauvaise foi, which is that its intelligibility depends on freedom.
[[Where **power** is read **exclusively as an imposition** **erases the
agency** of those upon whom it is imposed]{.mark}. Whether the gods,
language, or the sovereign, the point remains that [agency]{.mark}
somewhere [raises the question of how it is to be understood elsewhere.
Masking this requires avoiding resources of **communication, critique,
evidence, and meaning**.]{.mark} The **communicability of power** raises
the question of its transcendence of efforts at **unilateral meaning**.
Despite attempts to make [reality]{.mark} what one may say it is, what
it could be [is always more. Power is the **ability to make things
happen** with access to the means of doing so.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Where locked in the reach of the physical, it offers no difference from
force. [**[Human reality]{.mark}**, however, **[offers
resources]{.mark}** of transcending physical location [through
communication, meaning, and]{.mark} the **ongoing production of [social
reality]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This could be reformulated as the
proliferation of options. A human being need not be where the effects of
her or his actions take place. [The ability to make things happen with
the means of doing so also includes, then, the ability not only to
increase access to the means but also the cultivation of other
means.]{.underline} We could call this positive power. Coercive power,
which we could also call negative power, involves decreasing such
access. This amounts to power's relationality. The error is to think
about what power "is" instead of what power is about, which is what at
least human beings do. The human world is to some extent what Freud
called a prosthetic god.23 Living in a world of limited material
options, human beings have managed to produce a world of prosthetic
materiality. We could call this form of materiality "options."24

In October 2015, the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement petitioned the
Democratic National Committee (DNC) to sponsor a presidential debate
with candidates for the 2016 election, focused solely on the concerns of
the BLM. The DNC declined the request for debate but did offer to help
the BLM host a presidential candidate forum or townhall. This led to a
series of conversations about the structure and format of public debates
and townhalls, and about which form of activity would allow Black
publics to interact substantively with those politicians seeking to lead
the country. The BLM's request for a presidential debate came just weeks
after news of a group of prison inmates in a maximum-security prison in
upstate New York defeated a group of Harvard University debaters. The
incarcerated debaters were students in the Bard Prison Initiative, a
program housed at Bard College, that offers college coursework to
inmates.

More than 60 years ago, Malcolm X honed his oratorical talents on a
prison debate team. Today communities of color have been ravaged by the
far-reaching effects of the prison industrial complex, and its role in
the enforcement of tough-on-crime policies that have led to the mass
incarceration of Black and Latino/a men and women. Far too many of our
youth have a better chance of encountering debate training in prison
than in the classroom. This is unacceptable. Bringing debate into
prisons offers us a clear picture of the kind of intellectual talents
that continue to languish behind bars. And the issue of mass
incarceration and over-policing of Black communities is one of the
critical issues that the BLM has placed on the agenda as a critical
topic for public debate and liberation.

[Together these examples demonstrate that **participating in and
[understanding]{.mark}** [how debates work are]{.mark} a
[critical]{.mark} part of active participation [in]{.mark} a
[democracy]{.mark}. Moreover, [having access to]{.mark} **good debating
[skills]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} a **critical literacy** to which all
students should have access. The ability [to]{.mark} **understand and
[evaluate]{.mark}** the relative **[merits of]{.mark} competing
[positions]{.mark}** is not merely an intellectual exercise. These
[skills]{.mark} materially **[impact]{.mark} the [quality of
life]{.mark}** of American citizens and all people. Moreover,
[when]{.mark} **matters of [rights]{.mark} and freedoms** [are
involved]{.mark}, these [skills become]{.mark} **increasingly
[important]{.mark}**. [If students do not know how to]{.mark} both
**ascertain and [evaluate]{.mark}** the **[key]{.mark} premises and
[ideas]{.mark}** behind the range of arguments that emerge in American
politics, [arguments that]{.mark} inevitably [shape **their

In the first few decades immediately following the end of slavery, Black
communities placed an extremely high value not only on access to a
good-quality public education, but also on access to a robust public
sphere in which Black communities, including women, men and children,
could come and debate issues that mattered. They wanted access to spaces
in which they could litigate qualities of leadership, strategies and
plans for racial advancement, and general ideas about what it meant to
be Black in the slowly receding shadow of enslavement. For communities
deeply invested in the quest for freedom, the right to have opinions and
to publicly share and deliberate about those opinions served as a mark
of freedom. Similarly, in the contemporary moment, the burgeoning Black
Lives Matter movement acknowledges that our movements are made clearer
and sharper through robust and vigorous debate, disagreement, and
consensus-building. But in order for leaders to use those skills as
adults, they must first learn them in the classroom.

This chapter offers a brief history of debate within Black communities
in the period between Emancipation and the Civil Rights Movement, with a
particular focus on debate activities from the 1920s through the 1960s.
[Community debate programs and the emergence of collegiate debate in
this period fit on the one hand with the [**importance of debate**
in]{.mark} the **creation and [cementation]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} a
[Black public]{.mark} sphere, but it also sets the stage for the
**cultures of debate** that emerge during the Civil Rights Movement. The
range of questions and issues with which these earlier communities
concerned themselves are instructive for **how educators might use
debate** in classrooms today.]{.underline} Therefore, I interrogate the
manner in which local communities in the first half of the 20th century
thought about the importance of debate as a form of political education
for citizens. Then I turn briefly to a few of the iconic debates that
took place during the Civil Rights Movement. These stories offer a vital
and necessary reminder that the expansion of American democracy always
requires a commitment to vigorous and sustained debate. In light of that
history, [we should consider **debate** a **vital part of a good
education**.]{.underline}

In May of 1892, Ida B. [Wells]{.underline}, a journalist and newspaper
owner in Memphis, Tennessee, launched a career as a public intellectual
and advocate after three of her friends were lynched. After she wrote a
blistering editorial in her paper, the Memphis Free Speech & Headlight,
townspeople burned down the newspaper's office and banished Wells from
town. She fled to Brooklyn, New York, where she stayed with the famous
African American poet and writer Frances Ellen Watkins Harper. In New
York, Wells ensconced herself in a vibrant social scene that included
the weekly meetings of many African American literary societies, where
participants would perform musical selections, give talks about prepared
papers and [engage in formal debates.]{.underline}

Copyright 0 2016. Taylor & Francis Group. All rights reserved. One
popular outlet for such debates was the Bethel Literary Association in
New York. There debates which pitted pairs of debaters against each
other covered a wide range of topics including "Resolved, that we need
wealth more than we do education"; "Resolved, that we should encourage
western emigration"; "Labor is a greater power than capital"; "That we
owe no party a debt of gratitude"; and "That we need industrial more
than academical education" (Peterson, 2011, pp. 346--347). Carla
Peterson (2011) notes that the Bethel Literary Association was
remarkable for its inclusion of female debaters: "[Not only did women
now share a public venue with men, but they argued with them over policy
on equal terms]{.underline}" (pp. 347--348).

The leading Black lyceum in the city, the Brooklyn Literary Union, known
for its debates, was less welcoming to women. The Union had strict
debating guidelines. Four debaters gave ten-minute presentations. Then
there was a 45-minute discussion, followed by a vote from the audience
(Giddings, 2008, p. 234). Women were rarely among those featured as
lecturers or debaters. However, during the late summer or early fall of
1892, Wells participated in a debate at the Brooklyn Literary Union,
against, among others, Maritcha Lyons, a well-respected school principal
from an old New York family. Though [[Wells]{.mark} had been gaining a
local reputation as a **compelling speaker**, Lyons [bested]{.mark} her
[in]{.mark} the [debate]{.mark}. [Wells took defeat in her
stride]{.mark}]{.underline}, adopting Lyons as her mentor.

Lyons, together with Victoria Earle Matthews, another active member of
the Brooklyn Black literati, put together the event that launched
Wells's formal career as a public lecturer. In their mentor--mentee
relationships, Lyons imparted to Wells two main lessons. "'Be so
familiar with your discussion that you are literally saturated with it;
think, meditate, and reflect, to develop all the points in a logical
sequence.' Lyons also told Wells to learn how to 'manage the voice; if
thought is prolific, expression of ideas will become automatic'"
(Giddings, 2008, p. 235). [In the ensuing months and years after her
encounter with Lyons, [Wells went on to become the most]{.mark}
**visible [and vocal]{.mark}** [**anti-lynching advocate**]{.mark} of
her generation, helping for the next 30 years to bring visibility to the
**epidemic of lynchings** of African American men, women and children.
By the early 1910s, the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP) made anti-lynching one of its key political
issues, largely **because of the public foundation** **laid by Ida B.
Wells**.]{.underline}

In the mid 1920s, [Pauli [Murray]{.mark}]{.underline}, a famous Civil
Rights attorney, writer, professor, and the first Black woman to be
ordained an Episcopal priest, [[joined]{.mark} the [debate team]{.mark}
of the Hillside High School]{.underline}, the newly built "colored" high
school for students in Durham, North Carolina. "We had a debating team,
a glee club, organized baseball, boys' and girls' basketball teams, a
school newspaper, and a yearbook," she wrote (Murray, 1987, pp. 59--60).
All of these were "innovations utterly new to colored high school
students in our town" (Murray, 1987, pp. 59-- 60). Moreover, she wrote,
"our sports teams and debating team competed with those of other high
schools in the state, and it was the first time that colored students in
Durham had an opportunity to travel to other cities and expand our
horizons. These modest advances were important milestones for us. They
sustained our hope and gave us a sense of achievement at a time when the
prevailing view that Negroes were inherently inferior remained
unchallenged" (Murray, 1987, pp. 59--60). [[Murray suggests that access
to a **debate**]{.mark} **team and other modern forms of extracurricular
activity** [increased the rigor of her educational experience]{.mark}
and chipped away at the **sense of inferiority** that a separate and
**unequal system of public education** had produced in Black children,
an argument that would be critical to the overturning of the Plessy
decision in 1954]{.underline}. Moreover, debate and other activities
marked the modernization of the American high school. Among many firsts,
Pauli Murray graduated at the top of her class at Howard University Law
School in 1944, producing a senior thesis that formed the basis for the
legal strategy in the Brown desegregation decision. In addition to her
work on the inclusion of the word "sex" in the 1964 Civil Rights Act,
[[Murray]{.mark} also [played a role in]{.mark} the [dismantling]{.mark}
of [the]{.mark} **all-[white]{.mark}, all-[male jury system]{.mark}**.
The [first seeds of her]{.mark} **voluminous [career]{.mark}** as a
writer, thinker, academic, and poet undoubtedly [had]{.mark} some of
their [genesis in]{.mark} the years she spent "[preparing for]{.mark}
**inter-high school [debates]{.mark}** on the debating
team."]{.underline}

[This abbreviated history of Black debaters is a critical part of the
**intellectual and political history** of African American people. To
trace that history offers us a picture of the intellectual environs in
which [African American people **honed and refined**]{.mark} the
[arguments]{.mark} and strategies [that shaped]{.mark} Black political
[discourse]{.mark}]{.underline} in the period between the end of
Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Movement. This history of Blacks in
debate also gives us a picture of the kind of training that it took to
shape an African American leadership class in the post-slavery period.
The robust cultures of debating that Black people created in the
antebellum North and then throughout the country after Emancipation were
critical in building a Black public or counterpublic sphere, a place
where Black people could debate together about the collective fate of
African Americans. In these nascent iterations of a Black public sphere,
gender politics, and more specifically the participation of women,
constituted a site of battle; thus, I began with the women because it is
important to make visible the variety of ways that women participated in
and helped to fundamentally shape the inter-workings of these spaces.

Several years ago, while I was conducting research for a project on the
African American Club Women's Movement in Shreveport, Louisiana, in the
pages of the Shreveport Sun, the state's oldest Black weekly, I
unexpectedly began to see prominent front-page headlines advertising the
debates of Black colleges near and far. For instance, the front page of
the May 28, 1927 issue of the Sun proudly proclaims "Wiley College
Debating Team Defeats Howard Univ, 3 Points." The famed Wiley College
debate team was frequently the focus of the Sun's coverage, in part
because Marshall, Texas, home of Wiley College, is located only 30 miles
from Shreveport, just across the Texas state line.

Debate and forensic activities were so popular in Shreveport that Black
women who participated in the club movement also staged debates about
particular issues. In one such debate, the town's Mary Church Terrell
Club debated the topic "Resolved: That the South offers greater
inducements and better advantages to our people than any other part of
the country" ("Negative win in Debate", 1927). Mrs. Z. E. Baker and Mrs.
R. E. Brown argued the affirmative; the club's president Cora M. Allen
and Mrs. Alice Davis argued the negative. In 1927, [African Americans
were exiting the South in droves as part of the Great Migration to the
North in search of better jobs and more reasonable racial
conditions.]{.underline} As fairly well-to-do club women with stable
middle-class existences, women like Cora Allen, wife of the Rev. Luke
Allen who pastored the largest Black church in town, were part of cadre
of Black people who opted not to migrate. But the team of Allen and
Davis prevailed in the debate, [effectively **[defending]{.mark} the
[advantages]{.mark}** of leaving the South. [The debate is
**important**]{.mark}, however, [because it **makes clear**]{.mark} that
[the choice of whether to migrate or not]{.mark}, was in fact a debate,
**[rather than a foregone conclusion.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The Sun covered a range of forensic activities, including those of Black
colleges and universities throughout the country, and also debates at
local churches and high schools. For instance, in 1928 the paper
highlighted a story of a woman who had beaten a man in debate at the
Galilee Baptist Church on the topic "Resolved: That woman has done more
for humanity than man." The article noted that "it was fairly proven by
Miss Shelton that woman had done more for humanity than man. Mr. Bounds
made some strong points but came out ten points. The Sun's coverage of
community forensic activities was commensurate with coverage from other
newspapers throughout the country. In the early 1920s, the Chicago
Defender also covered college and community debate activities. In 1923,
the Grace Lyceum in Chicago had a debate on the topic "Slavery has been
more of a help than a hindrance to the American Negro" ("Young Women Win
Debate", 1928). An event sponsored by the "Older Girls and Young Woman's
Conferences" and the young men's council, the teams were split on the
basis of gender. The young men argued the affirmative position and the
girls argued the negative position. The young women won. In 1924,
another Chicago paper, the Broad Ax, covered the annual Elbridge L.
Adams Prize Debates held at Hampton Institute ("Douglass Society Wins
Adams Debate", 1924). That year the Douglass Literary Society beat the
Dunbar Literary Society debating the topic, "Resolved: That compulsory
military training should be abolished in secondary schools." The
Douglass Society team argued the negative.

In 1932, the Sun reported that there had been "a revival of
intercollegiate debating activities among the schools of the South
Central Association of Colleges for Negro Youth." Among those schools
were Southern University, Straight College, Alcorn State University,
Leland College, and the University of New Orleans. The subject under
consideration during the spring 1932 debating season was "Resolved: That
Great Britain should give India complete and immediate independence"
("Southern Debaters Win", 1932). These young Black students were engaged
in debates over British imperialism and the ethics and value of
anti-colonialism in the 1930s. The broad national coverage of community
and college debate activities in the Black Press suggests that locally
and nationally Black communities valued vigorous debate and discussion
and also that they took great pride in seeing young African Americans
engage in these activities. The topics also suggest that conversations
in Black public culture attended to more general questions of history
and social relationships between the sexes as well as debates about
contemporary political issues like mandatory military training and the
ethics of colonialism. The debates themselves, audience participation,
and coverage in the Black Press all participated in raising community
literacies and consciousness around these important political issues
that certainly had implications for Black communities living in the
thick of Southern Jim Crow regimes.

Interracial debates constituted another major aspect of the Black
Press's coverage of Black participation in debate. In May 1923, Lewis
Burrell, a debater and team captain at Pleasantville High School in
Pleasantville, New Jersey, led his white teammates to victory debating
Haddonfield High School on the question "Resolved: That the Merchant
Marine of the United States should be subsidized by the federal
government" ("Leads White Team Mates", 1923). In the 1930s, these
interracial exchanges became even more common, particularly among
college debaters. In 1932 the Wiley College debaters embarked on a
10,000-mile Goodwill Tour, doing exhibition debates throughout the
country. The Sun reported that "As a means of promoting better
understanding between the races, Wiley has sought to make contacts with
some of the white colleges thru \[sic\] their debating teams." The paper
reported that their interactions with teams in Oklahoma, Michigan and
Chicago were gratifying, pleasant and profitable.

In 1933, teams from Wiley and the University of Kansas debated the topic
"Resolved: That Socialism would be preferable to Capitalism in the
United States." Wiley argued the affirmative while Kansas argued the
negative. The Sun ran this as the lead story in their March 4th issue,
with the headline "Interracial Debate Gets Big Ovation." Above the
masthead, another headline proclaimed, "Inauguration of a New United
States President Today" ("Interracial Debate Gets Big Ovation", 1933).
Franklin D. Roosevelt began his first term in office this same day. That
an interracial gathering of student competitors from the Midwest and
South came together in the early 1930s in the wake of the Great
Depression and on the verge of Roosevelt's New Deal to debate the merits
of socialism versus capitalism suggests that debates were ideal spaces
for capturing the political zeitgeist. Moreover they created
opportunities for students from different racial, geographical and
cultural backgrounds to come together in a meeting of minds over big
ideas. In 1939, the University of Chicago Debate Union traveled to
historically Black Lincoln University in Missouri to debate the topic,
"Why go to college: To learn how to live or to learn how to make a
living" ("Hold Round-Table Discussions", 1939). A picture of the
interracial group of debaters sitting and dialoguing ran with the
article in the Shreveport Sun providing a powerful visual demonstration
to the Black readership of the Sun about the importance of debate to the
work of racial advancement.

The broad swath of issues covered in these debates and the fact that
local audiences flocked to see them suggests that local communities were
politically engaged and that this engagement was intergenerational,
encompassing the political ideas of both the young people who primarily
participated in these debates and those adults and elders who served as
judges and audience members for such debates. The editorial board of the
Sun believed that space for discussion and debate was critical to the
public life of the city. A 1938 editorial argued that "a city with a
colored population as large as ours should have" among other things "a
Forum where current questions could be discussed and debated" and "a
debating society which might engage in forensic contests with
neighboring colleges on important questions of the day" ("More Cultural
Organizations Needed", 1938). The clear attention to debate in the press
coverage of cities as disparate as Shreveport, Louisiana, and Chicago,
Illinois in the 1920s and 1930s suggests that forensic activity was a
critical building block not only of African American educational
settings but also of African American public culture in the two decades
before the formal inauguration of the modern Civil Rights Movement.

As the Civil Rights Movement came to full articulation, beginning with
desegregation in 1954 and the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955, the
importance of formal debate and discussion took on a different meaning.
Now Black communities needed to think both ideologically and tactically
about what the goals of this latest iteration of the Black freedom
struggle were and how to go about achieving them. Many of these debates
played out formally among Black male leaders who advocated a liberal
integrationist view of the Civil Rights Struggle and those who advocated
a radical Black nationalist view. Chief among the Black nationalists was
Malcolm X, leader of the Nation of Islam, and a staunch opponent of the
philosophy of non-violence that undergirded the public face of the Civil
Rights Movement.

As is well documented, Malcolm X honed his oratorical skill as part of
the Norfolk Penal Colony Debating Program, during his stint as a
prisoner there in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Robert James Branham
writes that "Malcolm X was a brilliant debater, adept at dismantling the
positions of his opponents, converting their arguments to his own
advantage, and most importantly casting the issues of dispute in utter
and compelling clarity" (Branham, 1995, p. 117). Malcolm X valued
debating as a form of political speech, because, as he famously said in
his autobiography:

Standing up there, the faces looking at me, the things in my head coming
out of my mouth, while my brain searched for the next best thing to
follow what I was saying, and if I could sway them to my side by
handling it right, then I had won the debate -- once my feet got wet, I
was gone on debating.

(As cited in Branham, 1995, p. 121)

Despite the fact that Malcolm X became a debater and formidable
political thinker while in prison, the presence of the prison debate
program represented a moment where prisons were viewed as social
apparatuses that could appropriately redirect and prepare inmates for
productive lives as citizens upon their release (Branham, 1995, p. 118).
In an earlier era, even prisons recognized that teaching people to
debate was nothing less than preparing them for a critical and engaged
form of participation in democracy.

When Malcolm X was released from prison in the 1950s, now a convert to
Islam, he moved to Harlem where he refined his thinking as a street
preacher and minister of the Nation of Islam. As the Civil Rights
Movement matured, Malcolm X emerged as the most formidable intraracial
adversary of Martin Luther King and those proponents of a liberal Civil
Rights Tradition. He engaged in a number of debates both throughout the
United States and famously in England at the Oxford Union a few months
before his death (see also Ambar, 2014; Tuck, 2014). Within the U.S. on
more than one occasion he debated Civil Rights figures like James Farmer
and Bayard Rustin. Martin Luther King refused to debate Malcolm X, and
most Civil Rights leaders were afraid to take him on in public as well,
because of his history of fiercely routing his opponents (Ogbar, 2004).

In October 1961, Malcolm X debated Bayard Rustin, one of the key
tacticians of the nonviolent direct action strategy, on the campus of
Howard University. The topic was "Integration or Separation." Each man
"spoke for about thirty minutes followed by a ten-minute rebuttal for
each." E. Franklin Frazier, the famous sociologist and author of The
Black Bourgeoisie, moderated the event. In the audience on the front row
that night sat a young, spellbound Stokely Carmichael. Before this
night, Carmichael had been a devotee of Rustin's non-violent teachings.
Freshly back on campus after a summer spent in Nashville organizing with
the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and participating
in the Freedom Rides organized by James Farmer and the Congress of
Racial Equality, Stokely was jubilant when he heard that Malcolm X was
planning to visit the campus (Joseph, 2014). Carmichael biographer
Peniel Joseph argues that Malcolm's lecture "galvanized racial pride at
Howard. He planted seeds of political conversion that would turn many in
the audience, over time, into ardent Black nationalists, committed
Pan-Africanists, and lifelong political radicals." Carmichael, who would
go on to be a key architect of the Black Power Movement, was one such
figure.

Joseph writes that "Malcolm's physical swagger and intellectual bravado
made a lasting impression on Carmichael" (Joseph, 2014, p. 42; see also
Ogbar, 2004, p. 54).

James Farmer, national director of the Congress of Racial Equality,
proved that when it came to formal debates, swagger and bravado weren't
everything. From 1934 to 1938 Farmer served as member and eventually
captain of the famous Wiley College debate team. Thus, unlike his fellow
Civil Rights counterparts, he was unafraid to debate Malcolm. And he
proved to be X's most formidable opponent. On March 7, 1962, the two
debated each other at Cornell University also on the topic "Integration
or Segregation." This debate represented a convergence of the
intellectual, rhetorical and political traditions that brought African
Americans into the realms of formal debate, Farmer emerging through
Black collegiate debate channels and X emerging from the environs of the
prison debate and street preaching.

By all accounts, Farmer bested Malcolm in the first showdown in 1962.
Tactically, because Farmer had the first speech in the debate, he laid
the historical groundwork for the evils of Jim Crow and segregation.
Because X was known to recite a litany of these evils in order to make
the case against segregation, by covering that ground first, Farmer
claimed the prerogative to reframe the terms. The evils of segregation
that instilled a sense of inferiority in Black children, distorted the
perceptions of white people about their own supposed superiority, and
hurt American business through boycotts, were all reasons, in Farmer's
estimation, to support a robust program of integration. Where X
frequently cast integrationists as passive recipients of white
supremacist treatment, Farmer argued that it was prior generations of
Black people, people in his father's generation, who had thought "that
the way things always had to be and they always would be, so we put up
with it, took part in it, decided to exist and stay alive" (as cited in
Bosmajian, 1969). In recounting this story with his father, James Farmer
Sr., who on his deathbed gave the younger James his blessing to
participate in the 1961 Freedom Rides, Farmer situates those actively
involved in the desegregation struggle as those who are committed to
racial progress. He casts X's desire, vis-à-vis the Nation of Islam, for
a separate Black nation-state as the politically retrograde position,
one that moved Black people from "forced ghettoism" to "voluntary
ghettoism" (as cited in Bosmajian, 1969).

Farmer also pre-empted X's attempts to discredit him as a race man
because he had married a white woman. He argued simply that he believed
enough in the "virtue of Negroes that I do not even think those virtues
are so frail that they will be corrupted by contact with other people"
(as cited in Bosmajian, 1969). Finally, and most compellingly, Farmer
took on Malcolm's claim that the desire for integration was a bourgeois
desire. He argued that historically members of the Black middle class
were often against integration because it would hurt Black businesses
through competition with white business owners. By the time Malcolm
attempted to refute this argument by saying that Farmer still only spoke
for a minority of Blacks rather than the majority, the rhetorical heft
of his claim has been sufficiently mitigated.

In a subsequent debate with James Baldwin in September 1963, he and
Malcolm X tangled masterfully over which accounts of identity, and which
accounts of history, Black people should accept as a guide for moving
forward. Baldwin challenged Malcolm's desire to identify solely with the
African or Black part of his heritage and not with the American and
white parts of his heritage, particularly the histories of violence,
rape and enslavement with which such histories would demand we all
grapple. Malcolm simply replied that no other group was asked to give up
its cultural and racial identifications in service of identifying with
American history. Malcolm challenged the continuing investment of Civil
Rights leaders in non-violent strategies, saying to Baldwin, "never do
you find white people encouraging other whites to be non¬violent." In
other words, such tactics in Malcolm's estimation followed a set of
rules about non-violence to which white Americans themselves did not
even subscribe. In this debate, there were no clear winners and losers.
But what emerges is a picture of a robust culture of public debate among
African Americans about the proper ends, aims and goals of the Black
freedom project. The Civil Rights Movement and the subsequent Black
Power Movement were conceived in a culture of rigorous and powerful
debates, the most public of which occurred among Black men, about the
ways that history, notions of identity, religion and the politics of
power should inform the quest for African American freedom.

Whether we are talking about the life of anti-lynching crusader Ida B.
Wells in the post-Reconstruction era or Malcolm X during the Civil
Rights Movement, [[it is]{.mark} simply [impossible to understand
the]{.mark} **rich ideological [terrain]{.mark}** [upon which
the]{.mark} quest for **African American [freedom]{.mark}** grew
[without talking about the importance of formal debates and forensic
activity.]{.mark}]{.underline} In the nineteenth century, such
[activities were critical to the **formation of a Black public sphere**,
[as Black people were]{.mark} actively [involved in **imagining and
reimagining** their relationship]{.mark} to the larger American body
politic]{.underline} in the decades leading up to and following
Emancipation. After true emancipation, followed by a century of Jim Crow
segregation, proved elusive, the necessity of African American oratical
skill and rhetorical prowess became even more important to Black
communities throughout the country. Parents wanted their children to
have debate training, local communities tried to create debating
societies, and the Black Press invested in coverage of high school and
collegiate debates both to foster pride in African American achievement
and to creatively highlight how issues important to Black people were
being engaged publicly. The many debates that took place over the course
of the Civil Rights Movement then emerge not as tangential but rather as
central and fundamental to steering the course of the movement. As the
most vocal proponent of a Black nationalist framework, Malcolm X forced
the Civil Rights Movement and its leaders to refine its message, even as
his status as the more radical foil to King made King's arguments about
inclusion seem imminently more reasonable and attractive to liberal
white Americans.

[Teaching students [to debate means]{.mark} teaching students [to
**invest deeply** in the]{.mark} **power and [possibilities of
ideas]{.mark}**. Teaching students to debate means teaching them [to
**question**]{.mark} **more fully and [more deeply]{.mark}**. Teaching
them to debate means that we **foster dissatisfaction** with **easy
answers**. [Debate]{.mark} training emerges as a kind of boot camp
[for]{.mark} those [students who]{.mark} really [want t]{.mark}o know
what it means to grapple with and [**solve problems** that do not have
**easy**]{.mark} **or absolute [answers]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Each of
the major leaders profiled here used debate training to push America to
be a more inclusive democracy. Ida B. Wells, Pauli Murray, Malcolm X,
James Baldwin and James Farmer stood on the frontlines of public
discourse, challenging our country to tell ugly truths and to change.
Debate helped to teach them how to be the courageous leaders that they
were. In a moment when a whole new generation of activists, leaders,
thinkers and movers are taking to the street as part of the Black Lives
Matter movement, the resonances of these earlier movements insinuate
themselves. [These earlier movements and the debates on which they stood
remind us that the **quest for freedom demands our best thinking**, and
that our [best thinking is]{.mark} frequently [a **product of
work**]{.mark} **in community** [and contestation with others]{.mark}
who are as deeply invested as we are. At the same time, these debates
remind us of the importance of **civility and respect** and a mutual
appreciation for the importance of ideas. For no great movement for
social justice has ever been achieved without debate.]{.underline}

But the rise of ["**[Afro-pess]{.mark}imism**" as a philosophy in
academic and intellectual spaces [threatens to undermine a
politics]{.mark} rooted in such a sense [of]{.mark} [solidarity, in
favor of one that essentializes]{.mark} black [identity]{.mark} and
exceptionalizes black suffering as **intrinsically unanalogous** to the
oppression of other people. **[Afro-pess]{.mark}imism** [argues that
"anti-blackness" trumps]{.mark} **[all other]{.mark} systems of
[oppression]{.mark} and exploitation**, whether the racism that faces
nonblack people of color such as Palestinians or indigenous Americans,
antisemitism, capitalism, sexism, or transphobia.]{.underline}

At [the [core]{.mark}]{.underline} of this philosophy [[is]{.mark} the
belief [that]{.mark} the **[world's]{.mark} basic [breakdown]{.mark}**
of humans [is between **Humans and
Slaves**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} with the latter being the cross
that all black people of every distinction are born to bear to their
grave regardless of status or class. [The essence of blackness is to be
a slave, at every level and in every sense.]{.underline}

[By grouping together all blacks today as slaves]{.underline} --- from
striking black Starbucks baristas to black presidents, millionaires, and
landlords --- Afro-pessimism's [proponents render a **socialist
anti-racist politics** **null and void**.]{.underline} After all, if you
cannot solve the problem of racism because to be black means to be
essentially and eternally enslaved, then you cannot change it. By
placing race and blackness outside of history, Afro-pessimism makes
white supremacy unsolvable. [Furthermore, [by dividing the world]{.mark}
in all of its **mind-boggling complexity** [into a]{.mark}
[battle]{.mark} **between blacks and nonblacks** or **between Humans and
Slaves** [renders solidarity]{.mark} amongst blacks and others
[impossible and the]{.mark} presence of a **[black ruling-class
invisible]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The problems with this approach are many: [**Afro-[pessimists]{.mark}**
[take]{.mark} the flattened **definitions of [blackness]{.mark}**
preached [by]{.mark} **white [supremacists]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- a
state of universal and transhistorical abjection --- seemingly at their
word [[and warp it into]{.mark} a **badge of
[pride]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as black people become a race of eternal
victims. But what is particularly troubling about this schema is the
fact that Afro-pessimists reserve much of their ire not for the
overwhelmingly white bourgeoisie who lord over Western societies, and
[[they **remain**]{.mark} **largely [silent]{.mark}** [around]{.mark}
the sexism as well as the **homo-/transphobia** facing **black women and
queers**, because anti-blackness is believed to be uniquely worse than
**[other]{.mark} forms of identity-based
[discrimination]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[By placing **race and blackness** outside of history,
**[Afro-pess]{.mark}imism** [makes **white supremacy**
unsolvable]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The **ire of Afro-pessimists** is rather reserved for **[other people
of color]{.mark}**. Asians, indigenous Americans, and other nonblack
people of color, such as even Palestinians, [are]{.mark} categorized as
the **"junior [part]{.mark}ners" [of white supremacy]{.mark} and racial
capitalism.**]{.underline} The Afro-pessimist argument is that whites
and nonblack people of color are so psychologically invested in not
being burdened with the enslaving essence of blackness that solidarity
with blacks in any sort of political struggle is ultimately a fool's
errand.

Beset on all sides by enemies or false friends, the only logical
conclusion to this worldview would be black separatist politics --- a
tired and exhausted politics, if there ever was one. Afro-pessimism is
the old wine of black nationalism and separatism in the new bottle of an
alienated black middle-class intelligentsia.

At a certain level, one can understand why Afro-pessimism appears to be
on the rise in certain academic quarters: despite the ascendancy of a
select few black people into US politics and business, American racism
still rages on, most gruesomely sensationalized in police killing after
police killing of innocent black people. Racism is everywhere. Yet the
racism faced by a black single mother in a housing project in Jamaica,
Queens is evidently different from the experiences of tenured black
academics and graduate students at predominantly white Ivy League
universities.

This is the classic history of ethno-racial nationalist and separatist
ideologies. Claiming to speak on behalf of an ideologically constructed
"nation" or "race," the educated, bourgeois sections of an ethnicity or
racial group suppress class and other divisions within the group in
order to amass power. By propagating the idea of universal injury, an
elite within such a community can deflect attention from the enactment
of their power either against the social lessers or in brokering power
with existing, traditional elites outside of the so-called race or
nation.

This dynamic is also the story of another flavor of diasporic
ethno-nationalism: Zionism. [Afro-pessimism and Zionism rip
**identity-based oppressions** out of their historical contexts,
**conjure up essential identities** in their place, and **mock
multiracial coexistence** and integration as mere
fantasies.]{.underline}

[[For]{.mark} **Afro-[pessimists]{.mark}**, nonblacks will forever
**leech and feast** off of **black suffering**, [all of history reduced
to]{.mark} an **unrelenting [anti-blackness]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As
for Zionists, antisemitism is everywhere, in every time. Such
pessimistic and nationalistic worldviews halt the ability to extend
solidarity across different forms of oppression. They are thus the
opposite of the socialist project's goal of building a coalition of the
vast majority of the working class across lines of race, ethnicity, and
other divisions. [[By]{.mark} **mystifying and [flattening]{.mark}**
black [identity]{.mark}, **[Afro-pess]{.mark}imism** [robs its followers
of the **ability to discern class**]{.mark} **and other divisions**
[among]{.mark} black people [themselves]{.mark}]{.underline} --- eerily
similar to how Zionists cannot recognize the world-historic irony of an
oppressed minority, Jews, donning the role of oppressor in another
context, the settler-colonial state of Israel.

**Essentializing blackness [erases]{.underline} intersectional
antiblackness-- those are key to [mitigating]{.underline}
antiblackness.**

This tradition is not a tradition in [[Wilderson]{.mark} who **regularly
[critiques]{.mark}** [the]{.mark} **analogical [arrogance]{.mark}** [of
Marxism, feminism,]{.mark} and an **academic paradigm of
\"post-[colonialism]{.mark}\"** with less common reference to
**\"[queer]{.mark}\" or \"gay and lesbian\"** [categories of
analysis]{.mark} as well---all [in the name of pessimism]{.mark}. [For
him]{.mark}, [none of these]{.mark} **political frameworks** with their
**privileged identarian subjects** [can capture the condition of
**\"Blackness\"** ]{.mark}**and \"slavery\"**]{.underline} (or \"the
Black/Slave\"). While that perspective can allow for some
insights---ones certainly seen before around the Black world and ones
certainly avoided by so much institutional scholarship---[[it
leaves]{.mark} the **general categorical grid** of established
**[Western]{.mark} political [epistemologies]{.mark}** [intact]{.mark}.
The]{.underline} familiar [**academic terrain** of \"race, gender,
class, and sexuality\" frames the critique for \"Blackness\" of
\"gender, class, and sexuality\" in addition to \"**post-coloniality**\"
or \"**post-colonialism**.\" The [most **conventional**]{.mark} **US
academic [categories]{.mark}** [of **identity**]{.mark} **and analysis**
[are still]{.mark} rendered in full as discrete, **[monolithic]{.mark},
and monological** categories and referents]{.underline} (e.g., workers,
women, etc.), like the respective political ideologies based upon them
in the traditional ideological history of the white West (e.g., Marxism,
feminism, etc.). [[There are]{.mark} \"[workers]{.mark}\" and then there
are \"[women]{.mark},\" generically, and then sometimes there are
\"[gays]{.mark}\"]{.underline} by whatever name, not to mention
[\"[natives]{.mark}\"]{.underline} or the colonized [[in this]{.mark}
**culturally specific [epistemology]{.mark}** of a **specific culture of
colonialism** itself. The upshot is quite conservative, even
anachronistically so.]{.underline} This critique is an internal if
damning critique embodying and encouraging \[End Page 293\] pessimism
largely from within the established order of knowledge that it
analytically engages and categorically replenishes and preserves.

[The grid politics of [Wilderson\'s critique]{.mark} of \"**the ruse of
analogy**\" leaves all manner of \"Blackness\" in a wasteland. The
routine **categorical contrast** with \"**Native Americans**\"
[reduces]{.mark} all that and [**any colonial condition** to]{.mark} a
**startlingly [oversimplified]{.mark} matter** of \"land\"]{.underline}
(or \"land restoration\"); and [[it occludes **\"Afro-Indian\"
history**]{.underline}]{.mark} as well as \"Red-Black\" maroonage all
across the Americas. [[The]{.mark} **constant generic
[contrast]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} \"[fem]{.mark}inism\" or \"non-Black
women\" [eclipses the]{.mark} more **mammoth [criticism of
\"gender\"]{.mark}** writ large in Diop and Amadiume\'s Black-African
studies of Europe or \"Western Civilization\" as a \"racial patriarchy\"
of **pessimism and \"anti-Black\" imperialism**. [The contrast with
Marxism]{.mark} and its \"workers\" [never resurrects]{.mark} **any
[issues of]{.mark} \"[class]{.mark}\"** or economics from any other
perspective to recognize or to resist, [for example, the]{.mark} **white
[invention of Black elites]{.mark}** [as]{.mark} **vital [instruments of
racism]{.mark}**, anti-Blackness, and white-supremacism.]{.underline}
There never appears a trace of any critique of Black \"social class\'
(or political class) elitism in \"Afro-pessimism\" (2.0), which is a
tell-tale sign of petty-bourgeois or \"lumpen-bourgeois\" articulations.
[Lastly]{.mark}, [Wilderson\'s occasional categorical [contrast of
\"Blackness\" with Palestinians]{.mark}]{.underline} or al-Nakba (which
aligns in Arabic with the Swahili substitution for the term \"Middle
Passage\"---Maafa, the \"Catastrophe\") [[comprehends no Blackness in
Palestine]{.mark} or among Palestinians]{.underline}. His Afro-pessimism
can envision no Afro-Palestinianism, [[unlike a]{.mark} **great
[tradition of Pan-African discourses]{.mark}** that also do not
dislocate Palestine from an **anti-colonialist mapping** of the African
continent]{.underline} or the Afro-Asian landmass of a Pan-Africanist
and \"Bandung\" imagination, one powerfully shared by Malcolm X and
Fayez A. Sayegh. For \"Black Power\" internationally, Kwame Ture would
refer to Palestine as the \"tip of Africa\" and uphold Fatima Bernawi,
the iconic Black woman who\'s been named the \"first Palestinian female
political prisoner,\" as the paragon of \"Black and Palestinian
Revolutions.\"30 She is likewise canonized by other Afro-Palestinian
icons themselves, such as Ali Jiddeh and Mahmoud Jiddeh of the African
community of the Old City of Jerusalem, for example---or, say, Ahmad and
Jumaa Takrouri of Occupied Jericho---who are each among the greatest of
all icons across Historic Palestine, a country which has produced
multiple Black Panther formations in Hebrew as well as Arabic in the
1970s and the 1980s. Again, [[Wilderson]{.mark} tacitly
\"[nationalizes]{.mark}\" his category of \"[Blackness]{.mark}\"
although this is scarcely [in the **interests of Black people**]{.mark}
in or outside of the US colonized **mainland of Americanism**; and
[so]{.mark} none of the above \"[Blackness]{.mark}\" [survives]{.mark}
the **critical grid** [of]{.mark} a **very
Anglo-[American]{.mark}**]{.underline} (and white racist state-bound)
[[critique]{.underline}]{.mark} of \"analogy,\" regardless of the
\"Afro-pessimist\" text at hand.

Do not the vulgar colonial-nativist politics of Incognegro\'s strangely
overlooked comment on \"West Indians\" go full blown then in Red, White
& Black and elsewhere?31 \[End Page 294\]

[[There is here a]{.mark} **general critical [erasure]{.mark}**
[o]{.mark}f the massive tradition of **[Black
anti-colonialism]{.mark}**---or **anti-colonial Black resistance** to
\"anti-Blackness\" and anti-Black colonialism, which transcends
nationalization. Wilderson\'s \"Afro-pessimist\" rejects **the
anti-colonialist paradigms** of **supposedly \"other\" peoples**, and
yet in a manner that reinstates **US or Western coloniality**
nonetheless---a white colonialism that oppresses \"the Black\" inside
and outside the United States\'s official geopolitical
limits.]{.underline} This position can thus make a virtue out of
automatic and absolute anti-alliance postures with no further, actual
political action then required for Black people, \"the Black critic,\"
or any Black liberation struggle on this view. [Such chauvinism without
**political commitment or engagement** beyond critique is logically
consistent, for pessimism, where mere resentment or ressentiment can
masquerade as resistance]{.underline} or \"pro-Black\" \"radicalism.\"
After all, Afro-pessimism (2.0) begins with a proud suspicion of Black
liberation or Black liberation movement, itself, no less than of its
potentially \"anti-racist\" or \"anti-Black\" political alliances. This
provincial \"American\" pessimism reveals more affinities with Créolite
in the Caribbean than Césaire\'s anti-colonialist eruption of
Pan-African Négritude, in reality, [its narrowly and negatively
delimited rhetoric of the \"Blackness\" of \"the Black\"]{.underline}
(as \"Slave,\" of course) [notwithstanding. As if this too is a virtue,
pessimism is not just suspicious of power but possibility---while,
upholding dystopia, it is casually dismissive of all **historical
actuality** that does not support a pessimist paradigm, orientation or
sensibility.]{.underline} Analytically, moreover, [there is somehow **no
white colonialism** for Blacks to fight in Africa or Black countries of
Black people anywhere]{.underline} and no terrible landlessness that
afflicts the African diasporas of Blackness captive within white settler
and/or imperial state formations, for Wilderson and Afro-pessimism
(2.0).

THE HAPPY MARRIAGE OF CAPITALISM, AFROPESSIMISM, AND LIBERAL IDENTITY
POLITICS

We and our students want radical transformation, and so many often jump
to the latest and seemingly most radical sounding phrases, slogans, and
theories. In education, as in so many other disciplines, one of the
increasingly dominant phrases is "anti-Blackness" and the theory of
Afropessimism. The two foundational theorists here are Frank Wilderson
and Jared Sexton. For Wilderson, Afro-pessimism contends that "Blackness
cannot be separated from slavery," and that "the Slave's relationship to
violence is open-ended, gratuitous, without reason or constraint,"
whereas "the human's relationship to violence is always
contingent."\[3\]

[There are crucial problems with this framework that make it perfectly
acceptable to capitalism and perfectly antithetical to those who want to
change the world. For one, they are completely Eurocentric in that
Africa and the African diaspora are flattened into "Blackness" as a
condition of the "human."]{.underline} As Greg Thomas notes, this is
"the \[B\]lackness and humanism of white Americanism, specifically and
restrictively, an isolationist or exceptionalist Americanism."\[4\] In
other words, [Afropessimism takes aim at a civil society and takes
refuge in a Blackness that are both uniquely American. The U.S.
historical and political experience is transformed into a transcendent,
static, and universal ontological status or structure.]{.underline} More
specifically, the theories of academics in highly prestigious and
exclusive institutions in the U.S. are presented as ahistorical and
global realities.

As identities, Black and Blackness are, in the U.S., fairly recent
developments. The earliest recorded appearances are in Richard Wright's
1954, Black Power and in 1966 as the first words spoken by Black Panther
Stokely Carmichael when he left his jail cell after imprisonment for
registering voters. White and whiteness are older but still relatively
recent. Theodore Allen writes that he "found no instance of the official
use of the word 'white' as a token of social status before its
appearance in a Virginia law passed in 1691, referring to 'English or
other white women.'"\[5\] The point here, as Eugene Puryear observes,
"is that the ideology of white supremacy emerged not because of timeless
antagonisms based on phenotype differences, but in a precise historical
context related to the development of racial slavery."\[6\] This is
precisely the historical context that Afropessimism erases and precisely
the phenotypes they use to define Blackness.

Afropessimism addresses an apparent radical omission in the primary
theory that oppressed people have utilized for liberation: Marxism.
Wilderson's work, however, is based on a fundamental misreading of
Marxism, such as his contention that in "Marxist discourse" (whatever
that is) "racism is read off the base, as it were, as being derivative
of political economy."\[7\] To be sure, there's an unfortunate history
of some [Marxist groupings asserting "class first" politics, but Marx
and Engels, and Lenin, together with the history of the international
communist movement, always asserted the primacy of race. Marx's theory
of class was a theory of race and colonialism, as was his communist
organizing. As a historical-materialist, Marx understood that the base
and superstructure of society change over time and are
context-dependent.]{.underline} Neither the base nor superstructure are
unified, static, or ahistorical. The relations of production in the U.S.
are neither unified nor even strictly economic in the sense that they're
structured and divided by hierarchies of race, nationality, gender,
dis/ability, sexuality, and other divisions.In an 1894 letter, Engels
clarifies yet again the base-superstructure model, what it entails, how
it works, and exactly what it's supposed to do. First, he says that
"economic conditions... ultimately determines historical development.
But race itself is an economic factor."\[8\]

Marx not only supported anti-colonial uprisings in India and China but
even said that they might ignite the revolution in Britain. "It may seem
a very strange, and very paradoxical assertion," Marx wrote about the
1850-53 Taiping Rebellion in China, "that the next uprising of the
people of Europe, and their next movement for republican freedom and
economy of government, may depend more probably on what is now passing
in the Celestial Empire."\[9\]

[Marx fought ruthlessly against racism and national chauvinism,
particularly as he experienced the deep-seated racism of English workers
against the Irish.]{.underline} He "argued that an English workers\'
party, representing workers from an oppressor nation, had the duty to
support an oppressed nation's self-determination and independence" and
that "English workers could never attain liberation as long as the Irish
continued to be oppressed."\[10\] [He recognized that the fate of Black
slaves, Black workers, and white workers were bound
together]{.underline} when he wrote in Capital that "Labour cannot
emancipate itself in the white skin where in the \[B\]lack it is
branded."\[11\] [Marx even organized workers to support the abolitionist
struggle by galvanizing them to oppose a British intervention in the
U.S. Civil War on behalf of the slaveocracy, an intervention that,
because the British had the largest Navy in the world, could have
altered the war drastically.]{.underline}\[12\]

Perhaps the real problem is that Marx treats race as a dynamic and
contingent social production rather than a fixed and abstract
ontological category. Black people face particular forms of oppression
in the U.S. and elsewhere, as do other oppressed and exploited peoples.
These change over time and are in a dialectical relationship with the
overal social totality. Iyko Day got it right by equating economic
reductionism to Afro-pessimism, insofar as it "frames racial slavery as
a base for a colonial superstructure" and "fails to take into account
the dialectics of settler colonial capitalism."\[13\]

WHY THE NEOLIBERAL UNIVERSITY LOVES AFROPESSIMISM

[The reason anti-Blackness critique is welcome in schools is because it
is devoid of praxis and politics, or, to be more precise, because it
celebrates its lack of politics.]{.underline} The impossibility of
praxis and the rejection of organizing are fundamental tenets for two
reasons. [The first is that there is no answer to the question "what is
to be done?"]{.underline} and [the second is that the mass movements
necessary for transformation are]{.underline} "from the jump, an
[anti-black formation]{.underline}," as Wilderson told
IMIXWHATILIKE.\[14\] Of course, the only thing to do is to condemn every
attempt at fighting oppression and improving material conditions. For
example, when a student group at one of our schools staged a protest
when Condoleeza Rice came to speak, they were denounced as "anti-Black."
There was no political criteria for such a denouncement, no defense of
Rice, and likely no knowledge of the reasons behind the protest. It
didn't matter that Rice was a key figure of the white supremacist
imperialist power structure, or that she played a major role in the
murder of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, the torture of thousands of
Arab and African people.

Examples of "anti-Blackness" that often come up in organizing are that
non-Black people of color are to be met with suspicion when organizing
on issues that sharply affect Black people. One such issue is
immigration. In the struggle for immigrant rights, which is often
overcoded as a "Latinx" issue, some Black activists and organizers point
to the fact that 44% of those caged by ICE, for example, are Haitians.
Instead of directing their ire towards the racist state that holds many
Black immigrants in horrendous conditions, the focus then becomes the
irrevocable anti-Blackness that exists in Latinx communities. Ideologies
like Afro Pessimism have working class people of color (Black people
included) fighting amongst each other, with the same framework as
liberal identity politics. They both reduce solidarity to checking one's
privilege and fashioning oneself as the consummate ally of Black people
and their liberation. So, instead of building a united front against the
racist state, the lack of corporate/mainstream media focus on the fact
that there are many Black immigrants, and immigration is a "Black issue"
unnecessarily shifts attention to other workers who are subjected to the
same "anti-Black" ideology of the ruling class and it's media
apparatuses. Instead of calling out the "Latinx community" for their
"anti-Blackness" a revolutionary perspective frames the issue as not one
stemming from any said community, but from the ruling class which
oppresses the vast majority of immigrants in this country.

[Capital in these instances are let off the hook. The problem is no
longer that the ruling class owns the means of production and thus the
means of ideological production that reinforce anti-working class
ideologies such as racism. The problem is the "anti-Blackness"\--and the
often posited "inherent" anti-Blackness\--of non-Black communities. It's
a structural feature of society, but apparently one that can't be
changed. As a result, there's no need to do anything except
critique.]{.underline}

No wonder, then, that [Afropessimism is so welcome in the neoliberal
university and the increasingly corporatized public school system in the
U.S. It's incredibly easy to call something anti-Black, to condemn
anti-Blackness, and to play more-radical-than-thou.]{.underline} It's
more than easy, it's what academia is about. Moreover, and this is
related to the Rice protest mentioned earlier, when "Black faces" do
appear in "high places," they're immunized from any possible critique
from any group that isn't Black (enough). [It doesn't matter if the head
of a school, corporation, or any other entity has the same politics as
the imperialist and racist power structure, because they're black and so
to critique or challenge them would be an act of
anti-Blackness.]{.underline}

This last reason is why white people love Afropessimism so much. [The
vague calls to "follow Black people\'\' not only fulfill racist tropes
that all Black people are the same]{.underline} (in, for example, their
unruliness and "threat" to society) [but moreover let white people off
the hook for doing any real political investigation and
work.]{.underline} The real response to "Follow Black people\'\' is:
"Which Black people?" Should Derek follow his comrade Nino or John
McWhorter? Should he go to the police protest organized by the local
Black Lives Matter group or the one organized by the local Congress of
Racial Equality? Should he get his racial politics from Barack Obama or
Glen Ford? He certainly shouldn't get his politics\--or take his lessons
in class struggle\--from today's Afropessimists.

[None of this is to devalue Black leadership in the Black liberation
movement, to be clear. Black people have and will lead the Black
struggle and the broader class struggle.]{.underline} Nor is it to claim
that random white people should show up to a Black Lives Matter protest
and grab the microphone. Then again, how much of a problem is that
really? Shouldn't we forget the myth that we can learn all the proper
rules before we struggle and instead just go out and struggle? And as we
struggle, be conscientious of our actions and how they could be
perceived; know that we'll make mistakes and own up to them; and most
importantly build with those whom this racist society has segregated us
from so we can unite against a common enemy. Black people will lead the
Black struggle and the class struggle. So too will Asian Americans,
Indigenous people, and Latino/a/xs. So too will the child of an African
immigrant and a Filipino domestic worker. So too will some white people.
The key ingredients are unity, political clarity, and strategic
proficiency.

**The Black Intelligentsia has [become]{.underline} the ruling-class --

Perhaps we can see a similar dynamic at play with Afro-pessimism.

Both of these nationalist ideologies, Afro-pessimism and Zionism, are
tied to a particular social base. Michael Berkowitz notes in Zionist
Culture and West European Jewry before the First World War that
[Zionism's early reception, similar to [Afro-pessimism]{.mark}'s
[today]{.mark}, was [strongest amongst **middle-class**]{.mark} Western
and Central European Jews with a "**high degree of assimilation** . . .
a completed secondary school degree, and a strong likelihood of
university or professional education."]{.underline}

[[Integrated into]{.mark} the **US [power]{.mark} structure** [yet still
racialized]{.mark}, an **anxious [black intelligentsia]{.mark}** [gazes
into]{.mark} the navel of some [**black 'essence'** to]{.mark} [solidify
a **fragile**]{.mark} **sense of [identity]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[As [for Afro-pess]{.mark}imism, [Wilderson, Sexton, Hartman, Hortense
Spillers]{.mark}, and other **Afro-pessimist luminaries** [are]{.mark}
professors, most tenured, [at]{.mark} **[renowned]{.mark} American
[universities]{.mark}**, occupying positions **[far out of
reach]{.mark}** of an overwhelming majority of **black people** and
**other people of color** (or white people, for that
matter).]{.underline} [[They have integrated]{.mark} quite comfortably
[into **ruling-class**]{.mark} **institutions** [whose]{.mark} donors
and [administrators are]{.mark} still predominantly **[white and]{.mark}
thoroughly [bourgeois]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Thoroughly integrated into US power structures due to their class
position and education, [[this **black intelligentsia**]{.mark} takes
[on an **identity of eternal victims**]{.mark}**.** [The
**black**]{.mark} **[bourgeoisie]{.mark} and literati**, comfortable yet
conflicted, [usurp the struggle of the]{.mark} **present-day [black
poor]{.mark}** and the **latter-day enslaved**, [enabling]{.mark} [them

[past struggles]{.mark}** --- [and not lifting a finger to aid]{.mark}
in the struggle of working people of all colors in the
present.]{.underline}

This is a toxic, tragic brew of anxious, middle-class in-betweenness
inflected by a racial double consciousness of a sort particular to
integrated black elites. [Integrated into the US power structure yet
still racialized, this **anxious black intelligentsia** gazes into the
navel of some **black "essence"** to solidify **a fragile sense of
identity**, turning to the rupture of the Middle Passage as the birth of
this race of Eternal Victims or Slaves.]{.underline} Uneasy with being
integrated as a diasporic population, Afro-pessimists don an identity as
slaves in their quest for authenticity as the solution to their anxious
in-betweeness.

The Death of \"Social Death\" and Its Death?

With Wynter nowhere in sight, without any scenario of resistance or
revolt ever in the vicinity of slavery\'s consideration, Wilderson would
facilitate a revival of the writing of Orlando Patterson thanks to a
cherry-picked reference to Slavery and Social Death (1982). An anonymous
introduction to a recent \"Afro-pessimism\" reader describes the
conservative sociologist as \"erudite,\" simple and plain, customarily
bracketing a host of controversial issues central to any intellectual
analysis of \"Blackness\" and \"humanity.\"60 Vincent Brown pointed out
a decided misreading of the juridical notion of \"social death\" before
the rise of the death cult of Afro-pessimism (2.0), which fetishizes it
without understanding evidently or critical interrogation.61 But there
is much more to note on this matter. Patterson is a historical
sociologist of Occidentalism. His career [promotion of a
**meta-narrative of \"Western freedom\"** is inseparable from his
**academic narrative of slavery** and his **sociological promotion of
sexual integration** via intermarriage of Black women]{.underline} with
white men in Rituals of Blood: The Consequences of Slavery in Two
American Centuries (1999). How is this not a neo-slavery of concubinage
made conjugal and synonymous with \"life\" itself? His s[ociology of
slavery is one of **Western socio-cultural assimilation** and
**US-American political accommodation**.]{.underline} What a contrast
with the Diop and Amadiume perspective on \"racial patriarchy\" and
European empire. [[The reincarnation of Afro-pess]{.mark}imism
[avoids]{.mark} examination of]{.underline} \[End Page 303\]
[Patterson\'s [Occidentalism and its]{.mark} resultant [investment in
Black \"social death\" as a fetish]{.mark} and a phantasm.]{.underline}
But Wynter would not by any means. She ordinarily writes of \"master
codes\" of \"symbolic life and death\" as the central organizing
principles of all human social orders of existence, not merely the
\"master codes\" of plantation so-called \"slavemasters\" whose
antebellum legal statutes could be mistaken for an uncontested
reflection of actual historical reality by a subsequent school of
scholars. [[The \"death\" discourse]{.mark}]{.underline} of Patterson
[[is a vector of]{.mark} **[white]{.mark} disciplinary
[power]{.mark}**]{.underline} that was so frontally challenged by Black
Studies in the 1960s. Regarding history, Sterling Stuckey wrote in
Amistad, symbolically: \"white historians as a group are about as
popular among Black people as white policemen.\"62 Regarding sociology,
[Joyce A. Ladner edited]{.underline} The Death of White Sociology (1973)
[**in [a]{.mark} sort of [homocidal death]{.mark}** [wish for]{.mark}
**[Western]{.mark} \"[knowledge]{.mark} production\"** and \"**white
middle-class values**\"---not a death cult, [a death drive]{.mark}, a
death fetish [or]{.mark} an acceptance of **\"[social death]{.mark}\"
propaganda** for Black people or Black social history.]{.underline} But
these beasts die hard. Decades ago, Wynter could identify a crude
Western narrative of unfreedom from Patterson\'s earliest writings on
slavery: \"Dr. Patterson purports to discover in Cudjoe \[the legendary
leader of the Leeward Maroons in Jamaica\] an almost cowardly desire to
avoid battle and to escape detection. Such criticism suggests a lack of
understanding of the now well recognized tactics of successful guerilla
warfare, tactics which Cudjoe had brilliantly developed centuries before
their use by the Chinese and Cuban revolutionaries of modern times!\"63
This was her in Black Metamorphosis: New Natives in a New World, the
massive 900-plus page manuscript that she wrote in the 1970s for the
Institute of the Black World and which Derrick White describes as a
prelude to her ... work on humanism or her \"Theory of the Human.\"64

The tacit, presumed history of slavery inked by Wilderson\'s
\"Afro-pessimism\" cannot break free of the infamous Stanley Elkins
school of historiography. Both Elkins and [Wilderson share]{.underline}
the same geopolitical contours of Anglo-American
nationalism[---\"[slavery]{.mark}\" [is]{.mark} the US **settler state**
of slavery [delinked from the]{.mark} **rest of the
[world]{.mark}**---if one inscribes \"happiness\" in supposed
\"docility\" during slavery, the other re-inscribes that \"docility\"
with \"suffering.\" Black or African revolt never rocks
**Afro-pessimism\'s slavery**, or its whiteness]{.underline}, nor
Elkins\'s \"Sambo\" national fantasy and related \"Sambo\"
historiography. For him, as [[for Wilderson, Africans could only
emerge]{.mark} from the \"Middle Passage\" [as]{.mark} **tabulae
rasae**---negro, or \"[black]{.mark},\" [but \"no longer\"
African]{.mark}]{.underline} of any sort or in any way.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} Maafa or [\"Middle Passage\" [depiction is a
**white myth**]{.mark}**ology** [passed on yet]{.mark} long
**[debunked]{.mark} elsewhere**. Okun Edet Uya]{.underline} even
[showed]{.underline} in \"The Middle Passage and Personality Change
among Diaspora Africans\" (1993) [how **[new African]{.mark}-based modes
of [kinship]{.mark}** [were developed on the]{.mark} \"[slave
ships]{.mark}\" [that **supposedly eliminated**]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[End Page 304\] [[**Africanity and kinship** among the
enslaved]{.mark}.]{.underline} Much later, Eric Robert [Taylor made a
study of [hundreds of]{.mark} **officially [documented]{.mark}** and
often successful **anti-slavery [revolts]{.mark}**
[aboard]{.mark}]{.underline} in If We Must Die: Shipboard Insurrections
in the Era of the Atlantic Slave Trade (2006), [**subverting or
[sabotaging]{.mark}** some of the most beloved **[academic]{.mark}
folklore** [at the base]{.mark}. But **white nationalism** needs this
phantasmagoria; it needs the \"negro\" rhetorically **de-Africanized**
before it is semantically recoded as \"black\" or, in Wilderson,
\"Black.\"]{.underline} On a smaller scale, this white settler mythology
also ignores the falsely framed \"Herskovits-Frazier\" debate; the
essence of the very concept of \"diaspora\" widely commercialized in
academia now; and the once popular if passing historiographical trend
focusing on \"small\" or \"day-to-day\" resistance to slavery without
threatening the fundamental politics of US national history as a
professional discipline in the West.65 More stunning still in its
demystification of the tabula rasa dogma of Elkins\'s \"Sambo\" (and
hence Wilderson\'s \"Black/Slave\") is the heretical and exhaustive
historical work of Gerald Horne: The Counter Revolution of 1776: Slave
Resistance and the Origins of the United States of the America (2014)
flies infinitely beyond the prior research of Herbert Aptheker\'s
American Negro Slave Revolts (1943) and \"Maroons within the Present
Limits of the United States\" (1939). Horne meticulously chronicles how
maroonage determine the outlines of the US state merely assumed by
Wilderson. [The **[white]{.mark} power [discourse]{.mark}** [sacralized
in]{.mark} critique by [Afro-pess]{.mark}imism (2.0) [is]{.mark}
revealed not to be total or absolute at all but **delirious, addicted,
and [desperate]{.mark}** [in the face of]{.mark} **chronic, raucous, and
hemispheric** [Black-African resistance]{.mark} and revolt.]{.underline}
The anti-pessimist James Baldwin\'s account of white nationalist
histories that represent the enslavement of Africans as \"nothing more
than a record of humiliations gladly endured\"66 can help explain Elkins
and Wilderson\'s \"histories\" as ideological pieces of a sado-masochist
historiographical whole. [There is little to nothing but \"docile\"
humiliation in either case---with or without the overtly **nationalist
narrative** of \"happiness,\" with or without the covertly **white
nationalist narrative** of \"suffering.\"]{.underline}

In the end, [it is also telling that [this]{.mark} \"Afro-pessimist\"
[**embrace of \"social death\"** has never thought to ask]{.mark} what
or [whose]{.mark} conception of the \"[social]{.mark}\" [and
whose]{.mark} or what conception of \"[death]{.mark}\" [is
**assumed**]{.mark} **by the notion**, not to mention how African people
would respond to it accordingly over time and in various theaters of
struggle. This is a Western cosmology of \"death\" not lived by Black
people who do more than just die passively on white Western
terms.]{.underline} One might only recall the many African Studies
discussions of John Mbiti\'s African Religion and Philosophy (1969) with
its multiplying categories of the long, recently, soon-to-be and living
\"dead.\" [[The]{.mark} **entire [history of modern slavery]{.mark}**
[is rife with]{.mark} live [conflicts]{.mark} in conceptions of life and
death [between Africa and Europe]{.mark} in or en route [to the
Americas]{.mark} and]{.underline} \[End Page 305\] [back]{.underline}.
This topic is a rich one in Wynter\'s Black Metamorphosis where many a
rebel against slavery mounts the execution platform singing and laughing
in communal glee at the prospect of returning home in valor via a
spiritual escape from Western conceptions of \"life\" as well as Western
conceptions of \"death.\" Audre Lorde encodes as much in Our Dead Behind
Us (1986), its ancestral call animating an ongoing life of revolt in the
flesh. Another poet of the Black Arts Movement, Jayne Cortez celebrates
Black defiance of death and a Black murder of white life which her Black
life sees as no kind of life of at all: \"Death, you are ugly. You are
white. Death, you are death no more. ... Liberation in my head.
Liberation in my eye. ... I\'ve killed fear and my soul\'s on fire. I
confess I am armed and prepared to reproduce the love that made me
live.\"67 A slate of revolutionary figures of the iconic Black Panther
Party also brilliantly re-theorized life, death and existence under
colonial slavery and neo-slavery. Huey P. Newton\'s To Die for the
People (1972) and Revolutionary Suicide (1973) cast the ruling
oppressor\'s \"life\" as a \"reactionary suicide\" leading to a sorry
death without significance. Alprentice \"Bunchy\" Carter exceeded the
Western bourgeois conceit of biological life in \"Black Mother,\" a poem
where he achieves his humanity and his mother\'s freedom in the daring
disdain for \"natural death\" driving his outlaw rebellion: \"for a
slave of natural death who dies / can\'t balance out to two dead
flies.\"68 Like a Panther archetype himself, George Jackson found
immortal life in revolutionary praxis and maintains in Blood in My Eye
(1972) that the \"social\" in Western \"society\" is not truly
\"social\" at all since this colonial-fascist formation does not produce
\"society\" in fact but \"hierarchy\" whose aim is to fabricate the
illusion of a \"society above society\" to rule.69 He could have been
speaking of prison or pessimism when he wrote in Soledad Brother (1970):
\"They\'ve been \'killing all the niggers\' for nearly half a millennium
now, but I am still alive. I might be the most resilient dead man in the
universe. The upsetting thing is that they never take into consideration
the fact that I am going to resist.\"70

gamedZe: Uh huh. And [[it seems to flatten]{.mark} out and **homogenize
Black people**, reducing and owning the interpretation of
**[Black]{.mark} peoples' [experiences]{.mark}** [by]{.mark}
subordinating them to one supposedly absolute and **[totalizing]{.mark}
logic**]{.underline}.

gamEdze: It goes further by articulating that the maintenance of
antiblackness is crucial in sustaining the psychic health of white
people. In other words, the binary created through the construction of
blackness versus whiteness is the logic through which white people are
able to recognize themselves as human, and through which black people,
too, see white peo¬ple as human, and negate themselves. [While
[Afropess]{.mark}imism can be useful in identifying systems of
power]{.underline}---for instance, the mutual relationship of the racist
construct of "black people as criminals" with the legal system and the
capitalist prison-industrial complex---[it [falls short]{.mark} itself
[by asserting that there exists no other state]{.mark} for the **black
body** [except]{.mark} **perpetual [death]{.mark}**]{.underline}, so
con-sistently caving in on itself.

gamedZe: So, in that, [[it fails]{.mark} on **many levels** [to make
sense of]{.mark} the [nuanced]{.mark} ways in which [people]{.mark},
[despite]{.mark} their **supposed [nonexistence]{.mark}**, **exist in
and [navigate]{.mark}** through [the world]{.mark}.]{.underline} How
does Afropessimism understand its social death in relation to queerness
or disability---forms of otherness that also generate gratuitous
violence, exclusion, and oppression? But also, this particular
transplantation of the American thing (the origin of the school of
thought) to the continent is pretty wack. Even as the Black radical
tradition has largely been formulated and theorized in and from America,
and even as it often falls prey to American exceptionalisms in its quest
for forms of Black universalism, I think it holds radical potential for
us on the continent. As many theorists and thinkers of the Black radical
tradition have shown, [**[African]{.mark} cultural [practices]{.mark}**
have [formed]{.mark} the **basis of [Black revolt]{.mark}** across time
and space. I see [Afropess]{.mark}imism [as a departure from]{.mark}
that **tradition's dynamic foundations** in [African
culture]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Afropess]{.mark}imism]{.underline}, through its fixation on natal
alienation, tends to ignore the living connections to the continent,
seeming to take the severance of African people from the continent
through the middle passage as utter and complete. [It therefore [seems
to understand]{.mark} **Black [people]{.mark}** [not as]{.mark}
**cultural [subjects]{.mark}**]{.underline} who brought entire
cosmological worlds and practices with them [[but as hopeless]{.mark},
utterly dislocated beings only existing as the sum total of their
position in white supremacy.]{.underline} While I think that this can be
challenged even in a diasporic context, [[this contradiction is]{.mark}
**even more [pronounced]{.mark}** here [on the continent,
because]{.mark} although [many]{.mark} of us [are alienated]{.mark} from
African cultural practices and contexts, those [traditions
persist]{.mark} and are more or less proximate whether or not one is
immersed in them.]{.underline}

gamEdze: In this way, it can be difficult to move with the
Afropessimist, whose American-specific engagement with a particular
history defines the functioning of antiblackness, seen as a mechanism
that forms the foundational reality of every scenario of oppression.

[[Afropess]{.mark}imism's [refusal to engage its own]{.mark} **internal
[world]{.mark}**, to abandon its reactive and defensive nature, [leads
me to imagine]{.mark} it as a "placeholder politics," similar to the
ways [that **anxiety and anger** hold]{.mark} and protect [us from
entering the place]{.mark} **existing [beyond them]{.mark}**[. This
is]{.mark} not to offer a clean critique on Afropessimism but to situate
it as [a politics that]{.mark} perhaps [exists]{.mark} as [external to
something more effective]{.mark} in exploring and acknowledging the
internal--- the power and the pain.]{.underline}

Afropessimism finds no way to its own sadness.

gamedZe: [[The idea of]{.mark} **"[holding]{.mark}" [the]{.mark}
"[place]{.mark}"** [is]{.mark} quite a [nice]{.mark} one. [And
interesting to think]{.mark} about [how]{.mark}, in relation to the
continent, [it is]{.mark} perhaps [the **anxiety**]{.mark} **or the
anger** [of Afropessimism that]{.mark} holds the place that
[prevents]{.mark} or protects the descent into the **deep
[sadness]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Perhaps this is what Fred Moten (2003:
94), through Amiri Baraka, might refer to as "the tragic," which "is
always in relation to a quite particular and material loss," in this
case being "the impossibility of a return to an African, the
impossibility of an arrival at an American, home." [[The sadness]{.mark}
of the tragic [is too great]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**[Wilderson Indicts]{.underline}**

**Wilderson equates [everything]{.underline} to antiblackness --
[homogenizing]{.underline} millions off of personal encounters.**

José **Sanchez 22**, PhD student in history at Duke University,
6-13-2022, \"Against Afro-Pessimism,\" Jacobin,
<https://jacobin.com/2022/06/afro-pessimism-frank-wilderson-socialism-flattening-racism>,
kav

The exact meaning of Afro-pessimism as a philosophy is still being
teased out in academia and on social media. At its center is Frank
Wilderson III, especially after the 2020 publication of his half-memoir,
half-treatise work of what he calls "auto-theory," Afropessimism. In it,
[[Wilderson narrates stories from his life]{.mark}, especially episodes
between him and his coworkers, partners, friends, and others, in which
his blackness is made to be painfully visible and repelled. His
conclusion is that "at every scale of abstraction, violence saturates
black life," [consigning blacks to]{.mark} **perpetual
[enslavement]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

This argument lies at the core of Afro-pessimism as a philosophy: [the
belief that the **world's basic breakdown** of humans is between
**Humans and Slaves**, and all black people are the latter, regardless
of status or class. The essence of blackness is to be a
slave.]{.underline}

Though beautifully told at times, [the psychodrama]{.underline} of
[[this]{.underline}]{.mark} relatively blue-blooded, tenured University
of California professor [[morphs into]{.mark} an ideology that comes to
some **[unsavory conclusions.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Illustrative of the black exceptionalism that characterizes Wilderson's
thinking and Afro-pessimism as a philosophy is an episode in the memory
of an interaction between a younger Wilderson and a Palestinian friend.
Sameer, Wilderson's friend, recounts life in the Occupied Territories,
lamenting the "shameful and humiliating way the soldiers run their hands
up and down your body" at checkpoints --- but then slips that "the shame
and humiliation runs even deeper if the Israeli soldier is an Ethiopian
Jew."

[For Wilderson]{.underline}, this statement made the "earth \[give\]
way," causing him to spiral to a shocking conclusion: "I was faced with
the realization that in the collective unconscious, [Palestinian
insurgents have more in common with the Israeli state and civil society
than they do with Black people.]{.underline}"

[The [irrationality of assigning]{.mark} an **implacable
[anti-blackness]{.mark}** to an **entire people of [millions]{.mark}**
[based on a **singular encounter**]{.mark} ought to be clear enough. It
also ignores the existence of]{.underline}, say, Fatima Barnawi, a
Nigerian Palestianian detained in 1967 who, according to residents of
[the **Afro-Palestinian Jerusalem enclave** was called "Little
Harlem,"]{.underline} was the first Palestinian woman to be imprisoned
for a paramilitary operation against Israel.

Another indicative episode concerns when his father, an official at the
University of Minnesota, jointly runs a program with a tribal government
on a reservation outside of Minneapolis. Conflict ensues over rules and
funding, Native Americans and others gather into a room, and a Native
American man near a young Wilderson shouts, "We don't want you, a nigger
man, telling us what to do!" to applause.

[Wilderson argues that the **central struggle of the world** is one of
**whites and their non-white 'junior partners'** against all black
people, no matter their position. This is an **incredibly flattened**
worldview.]{.underline}

This prompts Wilderson to conclude that the "wealthy White housewives"
that his parents, middle-class figures of the ivory tower, knew and
worked with "shared the same psychic space as the Indians in the
underserved neighborhoods of South Minneapolis." And that within the
"collective unconscious" of indigenous Americans, "the specter of
Blackness was a greater threat than the settler institution that had
dispatched a Black professor to do its dirty work."

[Over and over, these [snapshots of]{.mark} **[Wilderson]{.mark}'s
life** scaffold into a bleak assessment [render]{.mark}ing the **central
struggle of the world** to be one of whites and their [non-white]{.mark}
"junior [partners]{.mark}" [against all black people, no matter their
position]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[This]{.underline} is an [**incredibly flattened worldview**, allowing
[Wilderson]{.mark} to [mask]{.mark} the **actual class differences**
that splinter the "races." One chief example is the fact [that his
parents are]{.mark} **middle-class [intellectuals]{.mark}** [who gave
him]{.mark} an **upbringing of socioeconomic [advantages]{.mark}** far
[out of the reach]{.mark} of most working people of all colors, whites
included.]{.underline} Wilderson spent his youth hopping from Ann Arbor
to Berkeley to Chicago as his parents' faculty positions changed. In
Minneapolis, they [**lived in the tony neighborhood of Kenwood**, with
the mansion of local hero and future vice president Walter Mondale
nearby --- a man who cavorted with Wilderson's father so much that
Mondale tried to convince him to run for Congress.]{.underline}
Afro-pessimism, according to Wilderson's telling, makes the existence of
black members of an elite or bourgeoisie illegible, and solidarity among
other racially oppressed peoples impossible.

**Wilderson has made Afropess [Americanized]{.underline},
[paradoxical]{.underline}, and further [colonized]{.underline}.**

Recently, putative foundations get presented or re-presented: [Frank
Wilderson publishes \"Afro-Pessimism & the End of
Redemption\"]{.underline} (2016) in The Occupied Times after Incognegro:
A Memoir of and Apartheid (2008) and [Red, White and Black]{.underline}:
Cinema and the Structures of US Antagonism (2010). The history of the
vexing concept mocked by countless African scholars and politicos will
go either unknown or unrecognized or both somehow in this latest
articulation nonetheless. Some incubation period seems to have given
[this \"Afro-pessimism\" a very odd new breed of life]{.underline}.
Intellectually, it is presented as a \"new\" brand, still, somehow---in
an academic discourse on slavery, but a brand that can\'t possibly be
\"new\" at all of course. Copyright issues of capitalism
notwithstanding, [this is a kind of \"Afro-pessimism
(2.0)\"]{.underline}---kind of. It is very much of the old while
effecting some great and deliberate ignorance of that which shapes and
informs it. The global-conservative racist colonial-imperialist matrix
of the \"old\" is simply disregarded by the \"new\" in its re-branding
for the contemporary academic marketplace. Hence, [Wilderson
writes,]{.underline} \"[**[Afro-pess]{.mark}imism** [argues that]{.mark}
the regime of violence that subsumes **Black bodies** is different from
the **regime of violence** that subsumes **hyper-exploited colonial
subalterns**, **exploited workers** and other **oppressed
peoples**.]{.underline}\"21 He reprises, \"[Let me state the proposition
differently: **Human Life** is dependent on **Black death** for its
existence and for its **conceptual coherence**. [There is no World
without Blacks, yet there are no Blacks who are in the World.]{.mark}
The Black is indeed a **sentient being**, but the **constriction of
Humanist thought** is a constitutive disavowal of **Blackness as social
death**; a disavowal that theorises \[sic\] the Black as **degraded
human entity**: i.e., as an oppressed worker, a vanquished postcolonial
subaltern, or a non-Black woman suffering under the disciplinary regime
of patiarchy.]{.underline}\"22 What can be said of these
\"foundations,\" as it were, conventionally or unconventionally
speaking?

First of all, how is it that \"Afro-pessimism argues,\" in point of
fact? How does it become such a personified abstraction bestowed with
such a rhetorical aura of authority, begging so many questions as to the
perverse circumstances of its hypothetical birth, or rebirth?
Furthermore, how does this arguing \"Afro-pessimism\" get to have such
authoritative \"life\"---as a \"field\"; to be a living, speaking thing,
not a theory even but an oracular \"Theorist\"---when Black people as a
people (or \"sentient beings\") are rendered as nothing but \"dead\" by
this [**[Afropess]{.mark}imism**[\'s]{.mark} **absolute
[commitment]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the **concept of \"[social
death]{.mark}\"** for Black people [on]{.mark} the **white
[plantations]{.mark} of African enslavement** and [after]{.mark} the
formal [demise]{.mark} of those plantations [still]{.mark}?]{.underline}

It\'s imperative to analyze this specific discourse (or notion) of
\"slavery\" embedded here along with the conception of history or the
geopolitics \[End Page 289\] of history inscribed by a \"Black\"
discourse that could so casually dub itself \"Afro-pessimism.\"
[[The]{.mark} **entire [discourse]{.mark}** [operates in]{.mark} the
flow of an **exceptionally [provincial time and place]{.mark}**. The
\"First Worldism\" noted in Afro-pessimism (1.0) by Emeagwali is matched
here by what Malcolm X marvelously defied as \"Americanism.\" A \"new,\"
\"pessimist\" critique of \"anti-Black racism\" is made in the age and
academic context of **liberal identity conflicts and
competitions**]{.underline}---\"after the revolution has failed,\" to
recall George L. Jackson, after counter-revolution has receded an array
of revolutionary movements of praxis from hegemonic and certainly
academic view. [[Wilderson adds]{.underline}]{.mark} in his writing
against redemption: \"We need to apprehend the profound and
irreconcilable difference between White supremacy (the colonial utility
of the Sand Creek massacre) and anti-Blackness (the human race\'s
necessity for violence against Black people). [[The]{.mark} antagonism
between the **[post-colonial subject]{.mark} and the
settler**]{.underline} (the Sand Creek massacre, or the Palestinian
Nakba) [[cannot]{.mark}---and should not [be]{.mark}---[analogized
with]{.mark} the **violence of [social death]{.mark}**: that is the
violence of slavery, which did not end in 1865, for the simple reason
that slavery did not end in 1865.\"]{.underline}23 The chronological
marker of \"1865\" is not insignificant or inconsequential. It indexes a
specific white settler nationalist project; the USA construct of
\"Americanism\" (or \"amerikanism\") and slaveocracy; an official, white
settler-slave state nationalist history and historiography[. [Yet
**Blackness and slavery** are]{.underline}]{.mark} [supposedly being
[thought at the most **global**]{.mark} **or worldly** [level of

**nation-state [ideal]{.mark}**, \"American\" meaning US settler
imperialism in North America---both the species of humanity and the
species of Blackness, which is cut up, constricted, and undercut from
the start by Wilderson\'s paradigm.]{.underline}

How should 1865 function for the London site of The Occupied Times?24
The powder-keg Haitian Revolution does not pivot around 1865, of course,
but 1791--1804. Britain declared a \"gradual\" abolition of slavery in
1833--34 with a typical \"compensation\" mandated for the slavers. So,
[[what of the official]{.mark} if spurious \"**[emancipation]{.mark}\"
[dates]{.mark}** [for the **rest**]{.mark} **of the Black world** of
Africa\'s enslaved diaspora]{.underline}? [Spain]{.underline} is said to
officially abolish slavery in 1811, for instance, while making
exceptions for colonies in Cuba, Santo Domingo, and Puerto Rico.
[Denmark]{.underline} proclaims abolition in its \"West Indies\" in
1846--1848, like [Sweden]{.underline} for Barthélemy in 1847.
[France]{.underline} is forced to follow suit, once more, in 1848; and
Gabon is \"founded\" accordingly in Africa as the US would Liberia, etc.
\"[Upper Canada]{.underline}\" was said to end slavery with the [British
and]{.underline} \"[Lower Canada]{.underline}\" (now Québec) with the
French, an interesting fact for narrations of the Underground Railroad
that often kept moving beyond Canada in the north back to the African
continent (often Sierra Leone). The Netherlands is said to do so in 1861
or 1863. The modern slavery founded in the \"Hispano-Portuguese slave
trade\" would thrive \[End Page 290\] in the Western Hemisphere both
before and after formal independence from Spain and Portugal. [[This is
key to debunk]{.mark} the \"**[Afro-pess]{.mark}imism**\" [that]{.mark}
thinks it [can delink **slavery and colonialism**]{.mark} as two
separate, even competing **entities or issues**.]{.underline} The
criollo settler-colonial slave-states of Cuba and Brazil do not
officially abolish slavery for Africans until two decades after 1865 in
1886 and 1888, respectively. Slavery was purportedly abolished in
Ecuador in 1851, but it is quite possible to move that pretentious date
to 1894, which is well beyond the official \"closing\" dates widely
touted for Brazil after Puerto Rico and Cuba in the Americas. [[To
think]{.mark} of **slavery\'s pseudo-abolition** in terms [of 1865
alone]{.mark} or any one date [is not to think]{.mark} on the level [of
\"Blackness\"]{.mark} and \"Human Life\" [at all; it is to reinscribe
the most]{.mark} imperial white \"[American]{.mark}\" [perspective
on]{.mark} slavery and [Blackness instead]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The conceptual-geopolitical trappings of \"1865\" fundamentally define
the discourse of \"Afro-Pessimism and the Ends of Redemption,\" like
assorted neo-pessimist texts: \"The expanding field of Afro-pessimism
theorises \[sic\] the structural relation between Blackness and Humanity
as an irreconcilable encounter, an antagonism. One cannot know Blackness
as distinct from slavery, for there is no Black temporality which is
antecedent to the temporality of the Black slave.\"25 Critically, Wole
Soyinka details \"pre-colonial\" African languages of \"black\"
self-identification from the Yoruba to the Ga to the Hausa peoples on
continent, for starters, in \"The African World and the Ethnocultural
Debate\" (1989). But [these details do not enter modern **Eurocentric
discussions** in the main,]{.underline} be they Marxist or anti-Marxist,
etc.26 [**[There is in Wilderson only the slaver\'s history of
slavery]{.mark}**---one slaver\'s official \"national\" or **state
history and discourse**. The \"expanding field\" of \"Afro-pessimism\"
(2.0) further expands anti-Black, anti-African conceptions of historical
agency. [There is nothing]{.mark} outside of, or before, or [countering
Wilderson\'s \"slavery\" for the African enslaved.]{.mark}]{.underline}
There is only Wilderson\'s \"Blackness,\" which is curious. For what [he
casts as \"Black\" rather than \"black\" is more accurately cast as
\"negro\"]{.underline} (in this specifically English usage, moreover,
with no memory of the Spanish or Portuguese etymology) and not even
\"Negro,\" quiet as it\'s kept---since all of [[Africa is]{.mark}
**flatly [foreclosed]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} this acutely
**[paradoxical]{.mark} \"[Afro-pess]{.mark}imism.\"**]{.underline} Both
Africa and diasporas eclipsed, his \"Blackness\" and \"Human Life\" turn
out to be the blackness and humanism of white Americanism, specifically
and restrictively, an isolationist or exceptionalist Americanism despite
the past and present hegemony of white Western humanism and its
\"anti-Black racism\" worldwide. What is the \"Afro\" in
\"Afro-pessimism,\" therefore, when this [[Afro-pess]{.mark}imism (2.0)
[revivifies]{.mark} in disguise [the \"negro\"]{.mark} concept [of
**white settler**]{.mark}**-slave state history** and
historiography]{.underline}? It ironically does so in the name of some
\"Blackness\" itself or, rather, the \"blackness\" of whiteness, of
white postulation---not the Blackness of Blackness or the
transvaluations \[End Page 291\] of manifold Black liberation movements
themselves, even as it blithely misappropriates the ongoing if now
naturalized cultural-political labor of that historic Blackness in the
upper case. [[A]{.mark} dominant [**Anglo-American discourse of
slavery** is all]{.mark} that [there is]{.mark} and ever was now when it
comes to the **Black and African**, all **anti-slavery discourses** and
**counter-discourses of slavery** as well as Blackness somehow
vanished.]{.underline}

A glaring absence of Black radical and revolutionary intellectual
history should be expected from any expression of \"Afro-pessimism.\"
Indeed, could Afro-pessimism 2.0 take hold as another trend in
mainstream academia except in the political void produced after the
1960s and \'70s by local as well as global counter-revolution and
counter-insurgency? This absence affects the shape and agenda of the
critical analysis of \"anti-Black racism\" in essential ways.
[Wilderson\'s critique of the **\"ruse of analogy\"** in Red, White &
Black becomes a refrain that naturalizes academic approaches to politics
now institutionalized with the continued reign of **Western bourgeois
liberalism**.]{.underline} For older and enduring Black radical
perspectives, the existence of \"anti-Black racism\" among non-Black
peoples, organizations, and movements is neither a new nor shocking
phenomenon. For many Black revolutionary movement logics of the \'60s
and \'70s, for instance, this did not preclude alliance (or the
exhaustion of alliances made) or lead to a doctrinaire rejection of
\"solidarity\" work and its international (or \"intercommunal\")
possibilities.27 \"Contradictions\" were expected, so to speak, in
theory and practice, which might be resolved or not, depending on
material interest, circumstance, etc. For them, this work was not about
gauging identity, or the perfection of a projected analogy, but
mobilization for the political accomplishments of revolution---a
revolutionism that could or may not work toward the development of a new
humanism not white or racist or anti-Black after all. The reach for
potential solidarities was not construed as a gift or an act of
good-willed benevolence, wise or unwise given the risks. Even solidarity
work with obviously problematic, openly enemy forces could be a
strategic or tactical mode of advancing Black collective self-interests
that might dispense with any alliance at any given moment in time
without seeing the relationship as a statement of some total identity or
non-identity of condition and interests. [The **notion of
[solidarity]{.mark}** [has]{.mark} nowadays [been
**superficialized**]{.mark}**, remaining riveted** on mere **rhetorical
proclamation** and **aesthetic or representational identification** in
neo-colonial culture industries here and there. An older, praxical
approach to alliance, perhaps \"analogy,\" and solidarity is not taken
up by current analyses of identity conflicts that prevail with the
resurgence of a more academic political-intellectualism and a now much
less contested liberalism.]{.underline} This is imperial
\"multiculturalism\" and its malcontents. As much as
[[Afro-pess]{.mark}imism (2.0)]{.underline} may object to certain
instances of liberalism, or \[End Page 292\] regulation white racist
liberalism at least, it [[assumes]{.mark} these **Western epistemic
[frameworks ]{.mark}**[of **white**]{.mark} **academic
[liberalism]{.mark}** all the same, [thereby ensconcing]{.mark} the
**colonialism and [neo-colonialism]{.mark}** it constantly and
symptomatically denegates in text after text.]{.underline}

One of Liza's daughters, [Ella Townsend, was born after emancipation,
but remained in the bondage of sharecropping in rural
Mississippi.]{.underline} As an adult, she carried a pistol with her in
the fields, determined to protect herself and the surrounding children.
One day, a white man on horseback rode into the fields. He had come to
abduct a young black girl.

Ella, carrying her pistol in a lunch pail, intervened. "You don't have
no black children and you're not going to beat no black children," she
told the intruder. "If you step down off that horse, I'll go to Hell and
back with you before Hell can scorch a feather."

"I do not believe that we can stop them ... because they must ultimately
stop themselves," Ta-Nehisi Coates says of white racists in the final
paragraph of his bestseller Between the World and Me, written as an open
letter to his son. Coates describes [[racism as]{.mark} galactic[, a
**physical law of the universe**]{.mark}, "[a]{.mark} **tenacious
[gravity]{.mark}**" [and a]{.mark} "**[cosmic
injustice]{.mark}**."]{.underline}

When a cop kills a black man, the police officer is "a force of nature,
the helpless agent of our world's physical laws." Society is equally
helpless against the natural order. "The earthquake cannot be
subpoenaed," says Coates.

In a widely replicated gesture, Coates locates the experience of racism
in the body, in a racism that "dislodges brains, blocks airways, rips
muscle, extracts organs, cracks bones, breaks teeth." In the slim
volume, fewer than two hundred pages, the word "body" or "bodies"
appears more than three hundred times. "In America," he writes, "it is
traditional to destroy the black body." Another brooding passage dwells
on the inevitability of this violence.

Yet Coates's [**descriptive language and haunting narrative** are not
mere metaphors. They [act as a kind of **ontological pivot**]{.mark},
[mystifying racism even]{.mark} [as it is anchored in its **physical
effects**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Metaphor has long been used to capture racism's almost **unimaginable
brutality**.]{.underline} Lynching became "strange fruit" in Abel
Meerpool's song, made famous by Billie Holiday. In a wry, tragic
innuendo, rape was referred to in Black communities as "nighttime
integration." [[The use]{.underline}]{.mark} of metaphor is not in
itself an obfuscation. But Coates [[wields metaphor to obscure rather
than]{.mark} [illuminate]{.mark} the **[reality]{.mark} of
racism**.]{.underline}

[[What we find]{.mark} all [too often]{.mark}]{.underline} in Coates's
narrative [universe [are bodies without life and]{.mark} a **[racism
without people]{.mark}**. [To give race]{.mark} an **[ontological
meaning]{.mark}**, to make it a **reality all its own**, [is to **drain
it of**]{.mark} **its place in [history]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} its
[roots in]{.mark} discrete [human action]{.mark}. [To deny the role of
life and people --- of politics ---]{.mark} as Coates does [is to also
**foreclose the possibility of liberation**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

No Helpless Agent

[Ella knew her mother Liza's **unimaginable suffering**, but her memory
was not a yoke on her shoulders. It **provoked something** in
Ella.]{.underline}

As an adult, she did not see the white predator stalking the fields as
some helpless agent. She took matters into her own hands. There was no
gravity strong enough to break her will or loosen her grip on her
pistol. Her efforts rippled beyond those cotton fields.

[Ella taught her own daughter, Fannie Lou Hamer, not only to struggle,
but to resist.]{.underline}

[[Fannie Lou was born into]{.mark} a [sharecropping]{.mark} family in
rural Mississippi [but would go on to become a beacon of]{.mark} the
[Civil Rights]{.mark} movement.]{.underline} She is best known for her
work registering black voters in Mississippi, most famously during
1964's Freedom Summer, at great personal risk.

[Police **arrested and beat** her. White **racists shot** at her.
**Lyndon [Johnson dismissed]{.mark}** [her]{.mark} as an
illiterate.]{.underline} In 1973, an interviewer asked her, "Do you have
faith that the system will ever work properly?" By then, [Fannie
Lou]{.underline} had seen a decade of setbacks and false dawns since
first walking off her plantation in 1962 to fight for Civil Rights.
[[She responded]{.underline}]{.mark},

We have to make it work. Ain't nothing going to be handed to you on a
silver platter. That's not just black people, that's people in general,
masses. See, I'm with the masses... You've got to fight. [Every step of
the way **you've got to fight**]{.underline}.

[[She **marched**]{.mark}. [She **sang**]{.mark} freedom songs. [She
**testified**]{.mark}. She **co-founded** the Mississippi Freedom
Democratic Party. For her, [the]{.mark} **logical [solution]{.mark}**
[was political]{.mark}: [uniting]{.mark} a [powerless]{.mark} many
[against]{.mark} a [powerful]{.mark} few. [White racists could be
stopped. Black people could resist, and Fannie Lou]{.mark} and so many
others [did just that.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Fannie Lou knew that the **wages of racism** were measured on the body.
"A black woman's body was never hers alone]{.underline}," she once
remarked. White doctors [sterilized]{.underline} her
[without]{.underline} her [consent during a minor surgery]{.underline},
a barbaric intrusion so common she called it a "Mississippi
appendectomy." However, [[though she knew racism's physical
toll]{.mark}, [she drew inspiration from]{.mark} stories of **[black
resistance]{.mark}** passed down orally across the generations. Hamer
recalled her **grandmother's will to survive** and her **mother's weapon
of protection**.]{.underline}

These **[intergenerational [resistance
narratives]{.mark}]{.underline}**, according to Charles Cobb in his book
This Nonviolent Stuff'll Get You Killed, "[[underlay]{.mark} a **deep
and powerful [collective memory]{.mark}** [that was invisible to whites
but greatly affected]{.mark} the **shape and course of [the]{.mark}
modern Freedom [Movement]{.mark}**]{.underline}." As a result, [[Fannie
Lou]{.mark} and so many others [possessed]{.mark} an **intimate
[knowledge]{.mark}** [not only of]{.mark} their own **human
[dignity]{.mark}**[, despite]{.mark} the [**racist brutality** they
endured, but also of]{.mark} the **human [frailty of their]{.mark}
racial [oppressors]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

In the years before Fannie Lou's political struggle began, whole
communities, black women and men, rose up against the violence that was
forced on black women's bodies. Feminist historian Danielle McGuire
argues this anti-rape community organizing in Alabama laid the
foundation for what eventually became the Montgomery Bus Boycott. She
observes, "The majority of leaders active in the Montgomery Improvement
Association in 1955 cut their political teeth demanding justice for
black women who were raped in the 1940s and early 1950s."

[Despite being a poor, black sharecropper drowning in the **poverty and
racial terror** endemic to rural Mississippi, Fannie [Lou held]{.mark}
fast to her **forbearers' stories of [resistance]{.mark}**[. She did not
resign herself to fatalism]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Coates does.

**Afro-pess** **[ignores]{.underline} how its pessimistic approach
[originated]{.underline} from [colonization]{.underline} and
[slavery]{.underline} -- only [embracing afro-optimism]{.underline}
solves.**

Africa and the Pessimism without History

Reading what some are today calling [\"**[Afro-pess]{.mark}imism**\"
[invites]{.mark} no small amount of **[amnesia]{.mark}, myopia, as well
as illiteracy**. [There is **little**]{.mark} **if any [Africa]{.mark}**
[to this discourse]{.mark} at all, its nominal **Afro-hyphenation**
notwithstanding.]{.underline} Armah sits atop the lengthy bibliography
on the \"Afro-Pessimism\" page at Incognegro.org for alphabetical
reasons alone. [The selection]{.underline} of The Beautyful Ones Are Not
Yet Born [is]{.underline} as symptomatic as this list\'s addition of an
Achille [Mbembe]{.underline} book in due course. There is Frantz
[Fanon]{.underline} but only his Black Skin, White Masks (1952) is
included to the exclusion of A Dying Colonialism (1959), The Wretched of
the Earth (1961), and Toward the African Revolution (1964). The rest of
the bibliography tends to dovetail with \"race\" and \"critical theory\"
canons of US-centered academic classrooms, graduate if not
undergraduate, across North America---with key duty-free imports from
Western \[End Page 284\] Europe. In any case, [what is the significance
of this term as a term, [its]{.mark} rather **[bizarre]{.mark}
adoption** [by]{.mark} **Black academic [advocates]{.mark}** who have
come to promote it today without any **apparent sense of the history**
of its ravaging the **African continent** and without any reference
whatsoever to the history of **insistent Black political-intellectual
resistance** to its application to Africans on the continent and in the
diaspora]{.underline}?

Crucially, [[neither **pess**]{.mark}**imism [nor optimism]{.mark}** [is
just a word]{.mark} in a dictionary]{.underline}. Fred Moten made a
certain call for \"optimism\" in an earlier, and terribly \"friendly,\"
response to this \"Afro-pessimism\" which could be deflected by Jared
Sexton as if optimism and pessimism were now virtually transposable
conceptual terminology or as if pessimism could suddenly be posed as a
strange mode of optimism itself---something like a philosophical detour
to it, after all, when all is said and done.11 That\'s a specious
revision to be sure. Yet [what goes ignored here is how [this]{.mark}
**lexical [couplet]{.mark}** [makes]{.mark} its [meaning]{.mark} in
**context, politically, in time and space**, particularly [in]{.mark}
**European languages** and **colonial-imperial [lexicons]{.mark},** most
notably perhaps in English as well as French,]{.underline} just for
example. It carries baggage too big to check in current games of
academic branding. What\'s more, [**[optimism and pess]{.mark}imism**
[do not]{.mark} ever [confront]{.mark} each other [on **equal
ground**]{.mark} here, any façade of even-handed as opposed to
**hierarchical dichotomy** aside. [The **pessimist**]{.mark}
**intellectual empire of the West** has **systematically [crowded
optimism]{.mark}** [out]{.mark} of serious contemplation [and come to
pin pess]{.mark}imist condemnation [to **all**]{.mark} **\"things\"
Black-African** in the interests of **white racist imperialism**, for
various and sundry periods of this empire. Who would overlook this issue
rather than address it frontally---in and beyond books of all
kinds]{.underline}?

[A **history or genealogy** of optimism and pessimism as \"ideologies\"
is hardly unavailable to us.]{.underline} The old Black radicalism of
[Cheikh Anta Diop]{.underline} wrote famously and at length about this
subject. The Cultural Unity of Black Africa (1959) [concluded in the
late 1950s]{.underline}, no less: \"the Meridional Cradle, confined to
the African continent in particular, is characterized by the matriarchal
family, the creation of the territorial state, in contrast to the Aryan
city-state, the emancipation of woman in domestic life, xenophilia,
cosmopolitanism, a sort of social collectivism having as a corollary a
tranquility going as far as unconcern for tomorrow, a material
solidarity of right for each individual....\" \"In the moral domain,\"
he continues, \"it shows an ideal of peace, of justice, of goodness and
an optimism which eliminates all notion of guilt or original sin in
religious and metaphysical institutions.\"12 Looking at literature in a
long world history, [Diop analyzed]{.underline} novels, tales, fables,
and comedies [to advance this **core proposition**, along with the
**material and economic** structures of human social development. His
Pan-[African critique of]{.mark} **European [imperialism]{.mark}**
[indicted not only]{.mark} its [culture of]{.mark} **\"[war]{.mark},
violence, crime, and conquests,\"** [but also its]{.mark} signature
**\"metaphysical [systems]{.mark}\" [of
pessimism]{.mark}**.]{.underline}13 [One could thus combat
\"anti-Black\" racism, \"anti-Black\" colonialism, and \"anti-Black\"
imperialism, so to speak,]{.underline} \[End Page 285\] [by confronting
or challenging the pessimism of Occidentalism---or [one could
reproduce]{.mark} this \"[anti-Black]{.mark}\" **empire of slavery and
colonialism** [by **adopting**]{.mark}**, reifying, and endorsing
[it]{.mark}**. The final words]{.underline} of The Cultural Unity of
Black Africa would proclaim in the spirit of revolutionary
decolonization and bona fide independence: \"[The universe of [tomorrow
will]{.mark} in all probability [be imbued with]{.mark} **African
[optimism]{.mark}**.]{.underline}\"14

How then does a current trend in academia proceed to dub itself
[\"**[Afro-pess]{.mark}imism**,\" simultaneously [deeming]{.mark} itself
a school of **Black radical thinking**, with [no]{.mark} [awareness of a
**critique**]{.mark} **of this stature**; **[no engagement]{.mark}**
with it at all; and **[no]{.mark} critical [explanation]{.mark}** [of
how]{.mark} \"**[Afro-pess]{.mark}imism**\" [could not]{.mark} as a
consequence [signify]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n **elemental
[contradiction]{.mark}** in terms]{.underline}? The late Diop remains
the most monumental historian of the Black world. [His intellectual
biography is as a legendary as his academic and extra-academic
scholarship. It is almost cliché now to recall that he was named the
most influential thinker of the 20th century---with W.E.B. DuBois---at
the First World Festival of Black Arts convened in Dakar of the
1960s.]{.underline} Even if Anglophone political and intellectual
circles show little awareness of his radical political practice and
related political imprisonment as opposition under Leopold Senghor in
neo-colonial Senegal---thinking too exclusively of his counter to
Egyptology or his anti-Hellenomania---[Diop was and is no less a giant
for the historic Black Studies]{.underline} movement of the African
diaspora across the Americas.15

**Drawing [arbitrary]{.underline} lines to determine if actions are
anti-black [individualizes]{.underline} afropess. That

My objection is that the [authors' [call]{.mark} for
sociologist[s]{.mark} [to test whether]{.mark} diversity [practices
reproduce antiblackness reduces antiblackness to **individual
attitudes** and preferences toward African
Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}, though the authors stated that the
evidence of the afterlife of slavery is the ongoing production of
gratuitous violence and natal alienation specifically on black
populations. Wacquant's work has earned Sexton's praise and a central
place in the approach of Afro-pessimism specifically because it allows a
guideline to how scholars across disciplines can understand the
connections between blackness and slavery across time and social
institutions. The works of Stephen Dillon (2012), Michael Dumas (2016),
and Connie Wun (2016), though beyond the discipline of sociology, point
out a potentially distinct path for the way that the afterlife of
slavery implicates sociological research. The importance of the concept
should not lead Ray et al.'s readers to a distinction of how individuals
might personally relate to African Americans in organizations but
instead to ask how the dynamics of slavery structure institutions such
as schools, prisons, or even the market.

The four authors falter in their prescription of how sociologists can
incorporate Afro-pessimism specifically because of their limited
incorporation of political ontology. Essentially, [[if black populations
exist on an **ontological plane**]{.mark}]{.underline} Moten describes
[[as]{.mark} "[nothingness]{.mark}," [what is the **role of
institutions**]{.mark} such as the prison that very materially and
immediately shape the experiences of African
Americans]{.underline}?3Moten (2013b) and RAlessandra aengo (2016)
provide a way forward. Raengo observes, via Igor Kopytoff's (1986)
chapter in The Social Life of Things, that the political life of black
populations is distinctly a result of "the ontological violence of
slavery." Reading Hartman and Raengo, along with help from Sexton and
Wacquant, shows how institutions can differentially produce black life
across the black diaspora, while also being understood as instances of a
longer history that is characterized by the reformulation, as well as
lasting effects, of slavery. [[The afterlife of slavery]{.mark} is not
an issue of "testing" how diversity reproduces antiblackness or asking
how many black people need to be incarcerated for prison to be
considered an antiblack institution. Such approaches [reduce the
Afro-pessimist **mode of reading histories** of race to the **conditions
of black individuals**.]{.mark} Instead, Afro-pessimism's commitment to
the afterlife of slavery means seeking the threads from slavery through
the past, to the present and the future using black captivity, racial
terror and reformulations of slavery as terrifying
signposts.]{.underline}

it would be more obvious that [expanding an **airport**]{.underline},
[opening a new **coal mine**]{.underline}, [or pulling out of

violence]{.underline}. [They are acts of violence]{.underline}
[perpetrated against]{.underline} [**nature** and

problem identified by Rob Dixon, a professor at Princeton University's

"[Police violence]{.underline} [is an aspect of a]{.underline}

racist]{.underline}. [African activists]{.underline} [would have
been]{.underline} [less surprised]{.underline}. [Maangamizi]{.underline}
is a Swahili word that [means]{.underline} [havoc or
annihilation]{.underline}. It has become a shorthand term for an
"African holocaust" [that **[stretches from]{.mark}

**colonialism**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and **into current**]{.mark}
**[oppression]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and the threat]{.underline} [of

Kofi Mawuli Klu and Esther Stanford-Xosei from the Pan-Afrikan
Reparations Coalition in Europe. The group "sees [climate

The term genocide is not an exaggeration. The first genocide of the 20th
century was in German-controlled West Africa, a campaign called the
Vernichtung that drove out the Herero and Nama tribespeople. The [Times
of
Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-germanys-extermination-program-for-black-africans-a-template-for-the-holocaust/)
described it as a "template for the Holocaust." Similar atrocities
occurred in the Congo under Belgium, in Libya under Italian rule, and in
the French colonies like Algeria. Other crimes may not fit the specific
definition of genocide, but what is the right word for systematically
obliterating an entire culture, as British imperialist forces did in the
sacking of Benin? Although colonialism may have formally ended,
pan-Africans argue justice is yet to be done and the damage is ongoing.
As rapper [Akala](https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Akala/Maangamizi)
put it: "They changed that much? Are you so sure? The world's darker
people still the most poor?"

**[AT: African Nation Link]{.underline}**

**Racism and colonialism were [recreated]{.underline} by black settlers
in Liberia -- they [carried]{.underline} over [violent
structures]{.underline} with them. That [disproves any link]{.underline}
to African nations.**

The histories of Liberia and Israel, like the histories of African and
Jewish Americans, are not perfectly analogous. But key similarities are
there. [[Liberia]{.mark} and Israel were [founded by]{.mark} the
**[descendants]{.mark} [of oppressed]{.mark} peoples** whose
self-conceptions were strongly tied to being an **oppressed and
dehumanized people.** [These]{.mark} are nation-[states]{.mark}
[conceived as refuges from]{.mark} **ancient and lethal [hatreds]{.mark}
in faraway lands.**]{.underline}

Ironically, the respective settlers of both countries became a
dominating group themselves, building up states and societies that
served their interests as a group, particularly a clique of ruling
elites among them. Yet in Israel, Jews were able to achieve a
demographic majority and maintain it today through an apartheid system;
rhetoric and action against Palestinians in everyday Israeli politics
smacks of ethnic cleansing or even genocide. Palestinian birth rates are
described in apocalyptic terms of "demographic time bombs."' [In
Liberia, [the **manumitted slaves**]{.mark}**, free blacks, and
"mulattoes"** who made up the Americo-Liberian and West Indian--Liberian
dominant groups [were]{.mark} consistently [outnumbered by the]{.mark}
**masses of [indigenous]{.mark} Africans** that they quarreled and
traded with.]{.underline}

In 1816, the slaveholder-dominated Virginian statehouse asked the US
Congress to find a territory on the African coast to become a refuge for
free blacks and emancipated slaves. Both slaveholders and abolitionists
gathered at a Washington, DC hotel in December of that year and founded
the American Colonization Society (ACS). Colonizationists came to
believe that only by exporting blacks to a separate country could their
plight find resolution because of the impossibility of racial harmony in
the United States.

As Eric Burin writes in Slavery and the Peculiar Solution: A History of
the American Colonization Society, the ACS "hoped to rid the United
States of both slavery and black people." Exporting America's "Negro
problem" was initially a political outgrowth of early black nationalists
such as Paul Cuffe to address the plight of African Americans in the
antebellum republic. Cuffe, a sailor of mixed-race heritage, visited
Sierra Leone in 1811 to think through how the United States could
establish a similar project.

Sierra Leone was established in the late eighteenth century by black and
white British abolitionists as a "homeland," drawing black Britons, Nova
Scotians, and West Indians. Soon enough, British squadrons were
intercepting illegal, mostly Havana- and Rio de Janeiro--bound slave
ships, "liberating" the enslaved Africans on board and bringing them to
Sierra Leone, creating a polyglot and multireligious community. As the
nineteenth century progressed, Liberian colonization grew more and more
popular, with proponents growing to include US presidents James Monroe
and Andrew Jackson. Even Abraham Lincoln would flirt with the idea as
president.

Historians have concluded that paternalism and racism motivated the
ACS's actions. For example, many of its [Southern slaveholding members
believed that **free blacks posed a problem** to their interests and
**dreamed of shipping them all off to Liberia**.]{.underline} Yet in his
earlier years, the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison promoted the
colonization of and the sending off of free blacks to Liberia as the
most strategic pathway to furthering slavery's demise. It was only when
Garrison was shown by black allies that the masses of African Americans
were not pro-colonization that he became an opponent of the Liberian
settler-colonial project.

Against assimilationists like Frederick Douglass, [black
nationalists]{.underline} such as Martin Delany also looked to Liberia
to solve the problems of black America. Delany declared that "only
through wielding the national helm could Africans in the Americas
achieve their quest for representation and preserve their
distinctiveness." Douglass and the overwhelming majority of African
Americans, now generations removed from the Middle Passage and made into
a new people born through that rupture, believed that only struggling
for their liberation in their new homeland was the path forward.

Yet in Liberia, slaveholders, black nationalists, and do-good white
abolitionists pushed on. There, their thinking converged --- none of
them thinking for a second that the United States could actually be a
multiracial democracy.

[[Like]{.mark} the Afro-[pessimists]{.mark} today [who]{.mark}
fatalistically [believe in]{.mark} a **timeless and [intractable
anti-black racism]{.mark}**, [proponents of]{.mark} **Liberian
[colonization]{.mark}** [could not imagine that racism could be]{.mark}
**consciously [eliminated]{.mark}** [by the same]{.mark} human [beings
that actually gave birth to it.]{.mark} Racial animosity between blacks
and whites was imagined to be ingrained and unstoppable. And even if
emancipation could be won, peaceful, multiracial coexistence and
equality would be an impossible dream.]{.underline} Afro-pessimists
today are like the recalcitrant ACS members who kept promoting the
fantasies of Liberian colonization and back-to-Africa efforts[, even as
[strong majorities of black folks]{.mark} looked to more practical
solutions within their own environments, [often]{.mark}times
[ally]{.mark}ing [with]{.mark} [whites]{.mark} themselves.]{.underline}

However, with Reconstruction's defeat in the last quarter of the
nineteenth century, it is understandable why a minority of African
Americans looked to emigration and Liberia as a solution to their plight
in the United States as the century drew to a close. The Jim Crow
counterrevolution began to solidify, pushed by a frightened Northern and
Southern ruling class anxious to snuff out the democratic and
interracial popular energies unleashed by Reconstruction. This only
bolstered the claims of the ACS, in the ears of some. As Burin wrote,
"Insisting that African-Americans were unfit for citizenship in the
United States and that white people would inevitably crush black
aspirations, Society officials eagerly anticipated a postwar upsurge in
emigration."

Any upsurge in post--Civil War back-to-Africa efforts, however [broadly
unpopular, grew in times wherein racism became so intense that
**exasperated African Americans** could not help but seriously doubt
that they had a future in the United States.]{.underline} As Kenneth C.
Barnes concludes in Journey to Hope: The Back-to-Africa Movement in
Arkansas in the Late 1800s, "Interest in African emigration peaked among
black southerners in the 1890s, a time when cotton prices hit rock
bottom and white racism reached its zenith."

[In this rightward lurch in **US national politics**, **[black
emigration]{.mark} and racial pessimism** [becomes]{.mark} tragically
sensible --- [paralleling]{.mark} the context o[f
**Afro-pess**]{.mark}**imism's growing popularity** [in our]{.mark} own
bleak [times]{.mark} of primetime-televised **police killings and
growing inequality**.]{.underline}

In the beginning, the Liberian settlements were collaboratively run by
black settlers as well as white philanthropists and governors who
sincerely wanted to solve the United States' "Negro problem" through
exporting it. With independence in 1847, state affairs were fully in
black settler hands, in an effort driven by "well-heeled" elites, in
James Ciment's observations[. Through colonization efforts across the
United States and even the West Indies, [blacks developed a **diasporic
identity**]{.mark}, [mythologizing Africa as their]{.mark}
"[homeland]{.mark}" [in spite of]{.mark} the **cultural
[differences]{.mark} and distance** from the continent through the
abortive rupture of the Middle Passage.]{.underline}

[Yet almost from the very start of this **unique and black
settler-colonial experiment**, [tensions emerged between the **black
settlers and the indigenous Africans**]{.mark} that unraveled meanings
of blackness as well as exposed the limits of **black nationalism and
separatism**.]{.underline}

In an essay titled, "Black Imperialism: Americo-Liberian Rule over the
African Peoples of Liberia, 1841--1964", M. B. Akpan observes that due
to a variety of cultural differences between African American settlers
and indigenous Africans in Liberia that, "in spite of their color, they
were, as a rule, as foreign, and lacking in sentimental attachment to
Africa as were European colonialists elsewhere in Africa like the
British, the French, the Portuguese, and the Spaniards."
Americo-Liberian families carved up the tropical land amongst
themselves, dressed in the woolens of their respectable white
counterparts back in New York and Baltimore despite the oppressive heat
and scorning local fare like cassava for familiar tastes like pickled
beef.

[Americo-[Liberians]{.mark} had [become]{.mark}, as indigenous Africans
would call them, the **"[black white people]{.mark}."**]{.underline} As
Caree A. Banton argues in her book More Auspicious Shores: Barbadian
Migration to Liberia, Blackness, and the Making of an African Republic,
"[When [black migrants believed they had got]{.mark}ten [away
from]{.mark} the **dread and [terror of white supremacy and
colonialism]{.mark}**, [different aspects]{.mark} of the ideologies
[traveled to Liberia through]{.mark} black [migrants']{.mark} own
[internalization of them]{.mark}.]{.underline}"

Though indigenous Liberians outnumbered settlers a hundred to one,
Liberia's 1847 constitution didn't afford natives any rights or
privileges. Supported by US funds and arms, the settlers forcibly put
Africans into a "protectorate" relationship, requiring subjected peoples
to acknowledge the supremacy of the settler state over their own
governments in exchange for civilizing goods such as an assimilation
policy.

African youths, particularly illegitimate children, would be sired in
settler households to work as servants and be educated. Hinterland
villages were subjected to an onerous "hut tax" starting in 1916, and
such revenue was siphoned into the pockets of corrupt village and
settler elites. With later, twentieth-century pushes to centralize
settler governance, indigenous rebellions broke out among the ethnic
Grebos in 1910, the Krus in 1915, among others --- all defeated with the
help of US arms, personnel, and training.

[Perhaps the most sensational example of Americo-Liberian abuse against
indigenous Africans was [the scandal]{.mark} and League of Nations
investigation [into forced **labor recruitment and shipping** of
indigenous Liberians]{.mark} by Americo-Liberian elites [to]{.mark}
**work [the plantations]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the Spanish island
colony of Fernando Po, the northernmost part of Equatorial Guinea.
[Americo-Liberians would **turn a profit for th[is]{.mark} traffic** in
a scheme eerily [reminiscent of the crimes done to their
ancestors]{.mark}.]{.underline} I. K. Sundiata writes in "Prelude to
Scandal: Liberia and Fernando Po, 1880-1930" in the Journal of African
History, "Thus, the laborer found himself working for the period of the
advance, three months, as unpaid labor." Americo-Liberian settlers
ironically recreated the centuries-old tradition of African rulers
selling their own subjects to European merchants in exchange for power
and wealth over their remaining charges.

When the Jamaican Marcus Garvey's exploding back-to-Africa movement and
his Universal Negro Improvement Association made links with Monrovia
envoys, eyeing Liberia as a place to settle masses of followers in the
Americas, Americo-Liberian elites eventually responded with coldness
because they looked at Garvey as a contender for the power they had over
the country. Instead, Americo-Liberian elites looked to a white man
named Harvey Firestone, Sr who led the world's largest tire company and
who offered that the government pay off all of their debts in exchange
for more control over state affairs. In sidelining Garveyism while
putting the Liberian state once again under effective tutelage to white
capitalists in exchange for maintaining power over indigenous Africans
and others, [[Liberian]{.mark} settler [elite]{.mark}s once again
[found]{.mark}, in **blackness[, a]{.mark} useful [cover]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark} justifying **[an abusive ruling
class.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

- la mauvaise foi = bad faith

Lewis **Gordon 20**, Editor of the American Philosophical Association
Blog series Black Issues in Philosophy, American philosopher at the
University of Connecticut, 2-6-2020, \"The Sartrean Mind,\" Routledge,
pp. 503-504, <https://doi-org.10.4324/9781315100500>, kav

[[Many]{.mark} **philosophers and [scholars]{.mark}**]{.underline} who
find Sartre's thought useful often [[admit writing under the fire of
critics]{.mark} whose impositions are often neurotic and
ironic]{.underline}. This is because Sartre, like Beauvoir, Biko, Fanon,
and Wright, lived on a scale so grand that he made other intellectuals
feel "accused" and, worse, small. Few people could live up to the
standards they exemplified. They took on the difficult task of living as
truthfully as possible, which, unfortunately, made their lies and
moments of self-deception loom proverbially large. Some would call this
a problem of their authenticity, but that would not do them justice,
since it would ironically collapse them into a formulation they
ultimately transcended. Their goal was not "wholeness" or concerns with
being genuine or sincere, which is paradoxical since to make
authenticity an aim of one's life is, as Sartre showed in his early
writings, a form of inauthenticity. For him, this problem was that of
[mauvaise foi or bad faith.]{.underline}4 [A challenge with [addressing
a problem in]{.mark} terms of [bad faith is that]{.mark} its
[exemplars]{.mark} would immediately [deny such exemplification]{.mark}.
As many who have studied the phenomenon know, [bad faith is
**ashamed**]{.mark} **of itself** and thus **attempts to hide**,
including from itself, often through **shifting the orientation** of
critique. [Thus, the defense is on the alert for analyses of bad faith
to be in bad faith]{.mark}.]{.underline} Much of this has to do with the
negative associations of the word "bad" and the legalistic meaning of
bad faith in the English language, such as agreeing to do something one
doesn't intend to do. Thus, I will here simply use the French term la
mauvaise foi, even though mauvaise has its negative connotations. Its
range, however, is broader in usage than in English. La mauvaise foi
need not, for instance, be immoral. [The reasons why a human being seeks
retreat to it as a refuge could be excusable once her or his
circumstances are understood. As the focus here is [Black
existentialism]{.mark}, I will first offer a summary of the argument I
made in Bad Faith and Antiblack Racism, as I devoted much time to the
discussion of la mauvaise foi there.]{.underline} I will then add some
reflection on how I read Sartre today in light of the subsequent work
others and I have done on his thought and its continued relevance, at
least to Black and Africana phenomenological philosophy. [I argued that
[la mauvaise foi emerged]{.mark} not only [at]{.mark} the level of human
[phenomena in action]{.mark} but also in many of the ways in which they
are studied. For instance, the [**compartmentalist approach** of
separating race]{.mark} away [from other dimensions]{.mark} of human
reality distorted [the subject at hand.]{.mark} It could only be done,
ultimately, in la mauvaise foi because of the imposition of
non-relationality on a relational subject.]{.underline} The old debate
of race versus gender, or race versus class, or gender versus class, and
any of these versus sexual orientation is a fine intellectual exercise
under laboratory conditions in which the domain of inquiry is staked out
and constrained. That, however, is not human reality. The argument
actually goes back beyond Sartre to Bishop Berkeley and David Hume,
where no exemplar of a concept makes sense without other elements.
Prosaically, we don't see race, gender, class, or sexual orientation
walking around; we see people who exemplify all of these, all the time,
in different ways. [[Race]{.mark}, then, [should]{.mark} always [be
studied in relation to **what made it**]{.mark}, among other related
phenomena, **a reality of human life**]{.underline} from it's the
onaturalistic form in Iberia from about the tenth century to its secular
naturalistic ones since the seventeenth century. Sartre and those of us
influenced by Beauvoir's and his thought at first offer a superbly
simple argument. [Racism requires denying the humanity of other groups
of human beings through imposing racial hierarchies upon them and then
denying the ascription of human being to those designated "inferior."
[The **perf**]{.mark}**ormative [con]{.mark}tradiction** [is that they
would first have to]{.mark} be [identifi]{.mark}ed as human
[beings]{.mark} in order [to deny their being such]{.mark}. It is thus a
form of la mauvaise foi. I added, since racism is a form of la mauvaise
foi, antiblack racism, as a species of racism, must also be a form of la
mauvaise foi. Simple enough. The implications, however, are the
proverbial philosophical and social theoretical flesh for such
bones.]{.underline} For instance, the initial list of race, gender,
class, etc., is also premised on abstractions devoid of flesh. In
phenomenology, consciousness must be consciousness of something, but
that involves something being somewhere. For something to be
somewhere---let us say there---consciousness of it must be from
somewhere as well, that is, here. This relationship points to the body,
and embodiment requires, at least for human beings, consciousness in the
flesh. [[Disembodiment]{.mark}, then, [entails being nowhere]{.mark},
[which]{.mark}, then, [erases]{.mark} not only the relationship of
[intentionality but also relationality]{.mark}. [It is a form of]{.mark}
la mauvaise foi that recurs in many [analyses of dehumanized
relationships to phenomena.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Sabine Broeck (2017) provided an exquisite point to the criticism, such
that it is not only that the distancing of the humanity of slavery was
permitted by a dispassionate approach to the accounting of the slaves
but that such distancing also erases the legacy of slavery as formative
to "European thought, as well as on social, political and cultural
practices, including academia's self-sustaining discourses" (p. 139).
Indeed, other thinkers, such as Denise Ferreira da Silva (2011), Hartman
and Wilderson (2003), and Alexander Weheliye (2014), have argued that
the formulation of key themes and concepts central to European thought
have often omitted racial difference or occurred against the backdrop of
slavery. Essentially, [one of [Afro-pess]{.mark}imism['s]{.mark} most
relevant [criticisms]{.mark} for sociology [is the need to]{.mark}
historically and critically [trace]{.mark} seemingly commonplace
[sociological concepts in]{.mark} their legacy of [slavery]{.mark}.
Although it is uncontroversial to assume that slavery is of tremendous
importance to the contemporary social conditions of black populations,
slavery also implicates the epistemological foundations of
sociology.]{.underline} Ray et al. provide only a glimpse of the full
breadth of this criticism by focusing on Sexton's arguments against the
popular concept of "people of color." Instead, as Broeck (2016) stated,
citing Christina Sharpe (2016), [[Afro-pess]{.mark}imism
[demands]{.mark}]{.underline} ["[a white agonistic practice vis-à-vis
the humanist legacy of one's own training]{.underline}]{.mark}[, which
needs not the spectacular one-time-jump into disloyalty, but a fidelity

[interrogation of sociology's epistemic relationship to
slavery]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Furthermore, in the introduction to Red, White & Black, Wilderson
(2010:10) offered an explicit criticism of empirical approaches to
studying black populations, stating that tracking the experiential
conditions of black populations obscures an ontological research
paradigm. He went on to argue that a reliance on "facts" places a false
burden on the project of Afro-pessimism, such that the reliance on
empirical analysis of black populations exists to inaugurate an ongoing
but ultimately futile industry of applying faulty theories and concepts
to populations of black slaves. His point raises, perhaps the most
explicitly, a criticism that disturbs Ray et al.'s prescription for
labor-market studies. I will address this observation in depth shortly,
but it is necessary to also briefly review Fred Moten's (2013a)
engagement with Wilderson's (as well as Sexton's) points and their
implications for sociology. He wrote,

"Political ontology backs away from the experimental declivity that
Fanon and Du Bois were at least able to blaze, each in his own way
forging a sociological path that would move against the limiting force,
held in the ontological traces, of positivism, on the one hand, and
phenomenology, on the other, as each would serve as the foundation of a
theory of relations posing the nothingness of blackness in its
(negative) relation to the substance of subjectivity-as-nonblackness
(enacted in antiblack-ness). (p. 749)"

Moten is pointing toward what I would posit is effectively the impasse
for sociologists: if and how Afro-pessimism can be reconciled with
sociology. He went on to write,

"The paraontological distinction between blackness and blacks allows us
no longer to be enthralled by the notion that blackness is a property
that belongs to blacks (thereby placing certain formulations regarding
non/relationality and non/communicability on a different footing and
under a certain pressure) but also because ultimately it allows us to
detach blackness from the question of (the meaning of) being. (p. 749)"

What Moten is criticizing is a reflection of Wilderson's point, that
studying blackness, especially while accepting political ontology as a
central facet of Afro-pessimism, is actually antithetical to the
empirical study of black populations. What I wish to clarify here, as
further review of the back and forth between Moten and Sexton would
reveal, is that [what is at stake is not a wholesale rejection of
research on actual black communities, resistance, or
culture]{.underline} (Sexton 2011). Instead---and this is where Moten's
engagement with Du Bois and Fanon must be closely
read---[[Afro-pess]{.mark}imism [situates]{.mark} political [ontology as
a reference point for understanding black]{.mark} social [life, not as a
thesis to be tested]{.mark} by inevitably faulty concepts]{.underline}
(Moten 2008). [It is on this point that opponents of Afro-pessimism all
too often miss the nuance of its approach to the study of blackness as a
prior historical and cultural racial construct by pointing out the
empirical history of resistance, agency, and life of black
peoples]{.underline} (Gordon 2018; Kauanui 2017; Thomas 2018). Indeed,
[Afro-pessimists would warn against conceptualizing blackness as solely
the result of the actions and agency of black people. In positing
political ontology as an approach to writing ethnography on black
populations, Saucier argues that [Afro-pess]{.mark}imism [holds
implications for]{.mark} the [organizing]{.mark} and presentation of
[black life across disciplines]{.mark}, including sociology but also
that there are opportunities for scholars trained as sociologists to
engage with the approach.]{.underline}
