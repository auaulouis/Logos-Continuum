## \*\*Security Cooperation\*\*

### Must Be DoD

#### DoD is the only predictable limit to security cooperation, anything else proves limits explosion is inevitable

Sally **Sleeper** 20**21,** Select RAND Research on Security
Cooperation: 2006-2019, Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND Corporation,

[Security cooperation is an important and expanding instrument of U.S.
foreign policy that is employed widely to accomplish a **diverse set of
objectives.**]{.underline} Security cooperation goals vary depending on
current U.S. strategic and operational objectives and the partner nation
that is being engaged. **[Goals can include building the capacity of
partner security forces to improve the security environment,
strengthening relationships with foreign militaries and governments, and
securing access for U.S. military forces so they can more effectively
operate abroad.]{.underline}**

[The type of security cooperation that DoD deploys **depends on the
objective at hand and capabilities of the partner nation**]{.underline}.
DoD tends to deploy building partner capacity programs and security
force assistance to less developed partner nations in an effort to
improve their tactical and operational capabilities, while defense
institution building initiatives are used in similar contexts to
strengthen ministries of defense at the strategic level. On the other
hand, programs aimed at interoperability tend to be targeted at
more-developed allies. [DoD conducts about 3**,000 to 4,000 security
cooperation events** each year in more than 130 countries,]{.underline}
while total U.S. assistance to foreign militaries and police forces runs
from \$15 billion to \$20 billion per year. **[Security cooperation
activities touch tens of thousands of foreign security forces around the
world every year.]{.underline}** What do we know about security
cooperation? Are the strategic and operational goals of the enterprise
being met? Does security cooperation \"work\"? If so, under what
conditions?

### AT: Can't Include Security Assistance

#### There is no legal distinction between "security cooperation" and "security assistance"

Nina M. **Serafino 05-26-2-16**, Specialist in International Security
Affairs, "Security Assistance and Cooperation: Shared Responsibility of
the Departments of State and Defense", Congressional Research Service.
<https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/R44444.pdf> accessed 7-16-22//cpd

[The discussion of U.S. assistance to foreign military and other
security forces is complicated by the **lack of a standard and adequate
terminology.**]{.underline} "Military assistance[," "security
assistance," "security cooperation,"]{.underline} "security sector
assistance," "security force assistance," and "defense articles and
services" are all terms used in connection with the supply of weapons,
equipment, supplies, and training to such forces and, in some cases,
engagement with them. [Some of these terms are defined by policy
documents or in law]{.underline} (see Appendix A). [Some authorities are
labeled with two more informal terms]{.underline}---"build partner
capacity" or "train and equip"---which are used in the discussion of
specific authorities below.7

Terminology The two terms most commonly used today for assistance to
foreign military and security forces are "security assistance" and
"security cooperation." [Security assistance is the term most frequently
used, **regardless of the agency providing that assistance.** There is
no State Department definition for security assistance]{.underline}. The
annual State Department congressional budget justification (CBJ),
however, lists six budget accounts under the heading "International
Security Assistance." These accounts, with their underlying Title 22
authorities (the 1961 FAA and the AECA), are commonly regarded as the
State Department's security assistance portfolio.

### SC Includes Arms Sales 

#### Security Cooperation includes FMS, DCS, hybrid sales, leases, and EDA

**DSCA 10** \[The Defense Security Cooperation Agency is a part of the
United States Department of Defense; "SECURITY COOPERATION OVERVIEW";
2010 (Uses US Code 2010 Edition);
<https://www.dsca.mil/foreign-customer-guide/security-cooperation-overview>\]
//CH

The U.S. conducts Security Cooperation business with over 200 countries
and international organizations around the world. [We typically refer to
specific Security Cooperation activities]{.underline}, such as sales of
defense articles and services, as "programs" [and conduct them under two
primary U.S. legislative authorities: The Arms Export Control
Act]{.underline} (AECA) (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.), [as amended, and the
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961]{.underline} (FAA), [as
amended]{.underline} (22 U.S.C 2151 et seq.). Under these authorities,
[there are several methods available to provide foreign partners with
U.S. defense articles and services]{.underline}. The most commonly used
method is Foreign Military Sales (FMS) - but other alternatives might
also be available to meet your country's requirements. For any given
purchase your country may be considering, there are benefits,
limitations, and trade-offs associated with each of these methods.

**[Foreign Military Sales (FMS)]{.underline}**

[FMS is a program that allows your government to purchase defense
articles and services as well as design and construction services, from
the U.S. Government (USG]{.underline}). This program is operated on a
"no-profit" and "no-loss" basis to the USG and requires an authorized
representative from your government to submit a Letter of Request (LOR)
to the USG for the desired defense articles and services.

[Under FMS, the U.S. Department of Defense]{.underline}
(**[DoD]{.underline}**) procures defense articles and services for your
country using the same acquisition process used to procure for its own
military needs. This acquisition process is governed by the Federal
Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense Federal Acquisition
Regulation Supplement (DFARS). You, the foreign purchaser, benefit from
U.S. DoD technical and operational expertise, procurement
infrastructure, and purchasing practices. Your country also benefits
from the lower unit costs that result when the U.S. DoD is able to
combine your purchase with one of its own to achieve greater economy of
scale. In addition, [the U.S. DoD ensures your purchase takes into
consideration all of the necessary training, support, and sustainment to
give you the lasting operational capability you seek, known as the
"Total Package Approach".]{.underline} Finally, a major FMS program
increases your country's interoperability with U.S. military forces,
creating potential opportunities for joint training, joint exercises,
cooperation in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and
peacekeeping operations.

[FMS requires a government-to-government agreement, known as a Letter of
Offer and Acceptance (LOA) and also referred to as an "FMS
case"]{.underline}. When your U.S. counterparts speak of "writing a
case", they are talking about drafting an LOA. The LOA is written by the
USG and must be formally accepted by your government. The LOA specifies
the items and services to be provided to your country and an estimated
cost and timeframe for doing so. The USG may supply items from its own
stocks or it may enter into a contract with a defense contractor to
obtain the items on your behalf. Any contracts with U.S. defense
contractors, if needed, will be written by the USG using standard USG
competitive contracting procedures, to include robust oversight and
auditing. The contract will be between the USG and the U.S. defense
contractor. The USG then provides the equipment or service to your
country as agreed in the government-to-government LOA. FMS customers are
not legal participants in the procurement contract.

By Policy, the USG does not conduct FMS for profit. By U.S. law, the USG
may not incur debt on an FMS sale to your country. The LOA will require
that your country pay the full cost associated with the FMS sale - which
includes the cost of the defense equipment/services and any costs
incurred by the USG while providing you with the defense
equipment/services. We must ensure that, when the equipment or service
is delivered and the case is closed, the USG has neither made a profit
nor passed a debt to the U.S. taxpayer.

To build and re-build the administrative infrastructure necessary to
support individual FMS cases would be a slow process and very costly to
our foreign partners. Therefore, the USG maintains a standing
infrastructure at the DoD level, within each of the Military Departments
(MILDEPs), and within select other DoD organizations that conduct FMS.
That standing infrastructure - skilled employees, information technology
systems, offices, etc. - is funded by an administrative surcharge
applied to every FMS case. [The FMS administrative surcharge fund is
managed by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) under the
oversight of the DoD Comptroller]{.underline}.

For additional general information on the FMS process, see SAMM Chapter
4.

**[Direct Commercial Sale (DCS)]{.underline}**

[DCS involves commercial contracts negotiated directly between your
country and a U.S. defense contractor. DCS agreements are not
administered by the USG and do not involve a government-to-government
agreement. Instead, you deal with the U.S. contractor and that
contractor is responsible for obtaining an export license from the
Office of Defense Trade Controls, within the U.S. Department of State,
to conduct each sale]{.underline}. The regulations for DCS are contained
in the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).

[DCS is sometimes selected as an alternative to FMS]{.underline} when: a
purchasing government\'s military requirements are significantly
different from standard U.S. configurations; a purchasing government has
a sufficiently sophisticated procurement staff with experience in
defense systems; or when a purchasing government is seeking to establish
a relationship between a U.S. manufacturer and its own domestic
industry.

An extensive comparison of the advantages of FMS and DCS has been
compiled and published by the Defense Institute of Security Cooperation
Studies (DISCS -- formerly known as DISAM) in Chapter 15 of its
textbook, "The Management of Security Cooperation" - also referred to as
"The Green Book".

[The U.S. DoD is generally neutral as to whether a sale should be
accomplished using the FMS or the DCS process. However, as a matter of
policy, the USG will not engage a potential FMS case with your country
if you are already engaged in DCS discussions with a U.S.
contractor]{.underline}. Please refer to the DSCA Policy Letter on
concurrent FMS and Commercial Negotiations

[There are times when the DoD requires that a purchase be accomplished
through the FMS system. For example, the DoD requires all U.S. military
training to be obtained through FMS]{.underline}. The DoD may also
require defense articles to be sold "FMS-only." Two common reasons for
this are to ensure the security of sensitive technologies and the
control of weapons and munitions to prevent proliferation. The cognizant
U.S. MILDEP (Army, Navy, Air Force), or the U.S. manufacturer, will tell
you whether or not a particular item is FMS-only.

**[Hybrid Sales]{.underline}**

[It is possible to separate the FMS-only portions of a purchase from
those portions permitted to be sold via]{.underline} DCS. This process
is common for a foreign government to mix FMS and DCS when making major
purchases of complex systems, such as aircraft. [These are known as
hybrid sales]{.underline} and might, for example, involve purchase of an
airframe through DCS, and avionics, weapons, and training through FMS.
If you are initiating a DCS purchase with a company and expect that it
will (or might) include items that will be purchased via the FMS system,
[you]{.underline} should [contact the appropriate U.S.
MILDEP]{.underline} or [DSCA]{.underline} as early as possible. The
delivery timeline of your DCS end-item will likely depend in great
measure upon FMS items being integrated first, or upon FMS training
being provided at the appropriate time. It is therefore important that
you discuss your larger purchase plans and your operational objectives
with the appropriate MILDEP or DSCA to obtain an expert assessment and
firm understanding of the FMS timeline and any potential issues. The
defense contractor you are working with may not have full knowledge of
Military Department plans and timelines. Ultimately, the best source of
information on any equipment that is to be provided by the USG is the
USG itself.

**[Leases]{.underline}**

[The USG may lease defense articles to another country for temporary
use]{.underline} (not to exceed five years). In order to be eligible for
lease, an item must not be needed for USG use during the course of the
lease and is generally limited to investment (non-consumable) type
items. [Countries may use a lease to meet a short-term need or to fill a
critical defense requirement while waiting for a delivery of items
purchased through FMS or DCS]{.underline}. Leases can also be entered
into for a variety of other purposes, including cooperative research or
development, military exercises, and communications or electronics
interface projects. More detail on leases can be found in Section 11.6.
of the SAMM.

**[Excess Defense Articles (EDA)]{.underline}**

[When defense articles are declared excess by the U.S. DoD, they may be
sold through FMS or by grant to countries eligible to receive
EDA]{.underline}. Keep in mind however, that not all excess DoD articles
are made available for sale or grant; and U.S. government agencies are
given the first opportunity to acquire EDA. For EDA sales to foreign
customers, prices usually range from 5% to 50% of the original
acquisition value, depending on the condition of the item. EDA is
transferred on an "as-is, where-is" basis. This means that your country
will be required to pay any repair and refurbishment costs and,
generally, all transportation costs associated with getting the EDA to
your country. More detail on EDA can be found in Section 11.3. of the
SAMM.

[The above options may be used in different combinations to satisfy your
country's unique requirements. A Security Cooperation program might
consist of some items purchased through FMS]{.underline}, additional
items through DCS, and still others obtained via lease or EDA. The USG
can work with you to help you achieve the best "fit" for your needs.

### SC Includes Info-sharing 

#### Security cooperation includes info sharing

U.S. program with, or sale to, a particular country and, if so, its size
and scope]{.underline}.

[The DOS Bureau of Political Military Affairs Office of Regional
Security and Arms Transfers (PM/RSAT) is the lead DOS Bureau for SC
matters]{.underline}, including transfer approvals and the notifications
that must go to the U.S. Congress before a transfer can occur.

### 1NC -- SC =/= Frameworks

#### Security cooperation involves training, equipping, and supporting foreign military forces. Frameworks are tools used to assess, monitor, and evaluate those security cooperation activities but ARE NOT security cooperation activities themselves 

**CRS 17** (Congressional Research Service, informing the legislative
debate since 1914, "DOD Security Cooperation: Assessment, Monitoring,
and Evaluation", 6/23/17,
<https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN10726>) // EL

As part of recent efforts to modify existing security cooperation
authorities, the FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) (P.L.
114-328) enacted several new provisions that modify the budgeting,
execution, administration, and evaluation of Department of Defense (DOD)
security cooperation programs and activities. To date, [the Department
of Defense (DOD) has spent billions of dollars on efforts to train,
equip, and otherwise support foreign military and security forces. In
the 114th Congress, both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees
examined various aspects of DOD security cooperation efforts. Yet, prior
to this year, there has been no comprehensive, standardized framework to
judge the effectiveness of security cooperation programs,]{.underline}
as authorized by various security cooperation authorities (see CRS
Report R44602, DOD Security Cooperation: An Overview of Authorities and
Issues). In the conference report accompanying the FY2017 National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the conferees noted that [**although
there has been an increase in security cooperation activities over the
past 15 years, DOD "has not applied** sufficient emphasis and resources
to develop a **comprehensive framework to assess, monitor, and evaluate
its security cooperation programs and activities**,]{.underline}"
commonly referred to as AM&E.

#### Violation -- the plan fiats a coordinative framework 

#### That's a voter:

#### Limits -- infinite subsets of coordination framework aff's under the three emerging tech areas decks predictability, preround prep, and negative engagement 

#### Ground -- they're perceptually insignificant, it means they spike out of links to case turns, da's, k's, and make sketchy perms which is def abusive on an aff biased topic 

### 2NC -- No Frameworks!

#### Security cooperation includes building partner capacity, education, and training. Establishing frameworks is not security cooperation itself but a method of PREPARING security cooperation, which is distinct!

**Taliaferro 18** (Aaron C. Taliaferro, Project Leader - International
Defense Consultant, "A Framework for Security Cooperation Planning", The
Institute for Defense Analyses, Aug 2018,
<https://www.ida.org/research-and-publications/publications/all/a/af/a-framework-for-security-cooperation-planning>)
// EL

\"Building partner capacity has been a key component of U.S. defense
strategy since the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review was issued. However,
but for a few exceptions, the Military Departments of the U.S. Armed
Forces that have responsibility to organize, train, equip, and provide
forces to U.S. Combatant Commands have not prepared their people to be
good or even adequate at planning for steady-state, peacetime [security
cooperation activities, which is the principal way the Department of
Defense (DOD) builds partner capacity. Rather, the focus of military
education and training primarily remains on contingency and warfare
planning.]{.underline} While useful in those contexts, it is not useful
for steady-state, peacetime security cooperation planning[. Not only are
people poorly prepared, the DOD lacks a **framework for security
cooperation planning**.]{.underline} This paper's intent is to propose a
framework for security cooperation planning that helps the DOD and its
Military Departments understand how to adaptively influence, plan, and
resource security cooperation activities carried out in various foreign
nations and with members of foreign security forces.\"

### 1NC SC -- Must be Binding vs MoUs

#### Security cooperation is legally binding

**JCS 17** \[The Joint Chiefs of Staff is the body of the most senior
uniformed leaders within the United States Department of Defense, that
advises the president of the United States, the secretary of defense,
the Homeland Security Council and the National Security Council on
military matters; "Security Cooperation"; 5/23/17;
<https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/Doctrine/pubs/jp3_20_20172305.pdf>\]
//CH

Throughout the execution of SC activities, CCDRs and their staffs
continually direct, assess, monitor, evaluate, and adjust the SC
activities when possible and the CSCSs/country plans as required, while
the component commands do the same with their supporting plans. However,
once resourced, execution of specific SC activities occurs as planned
unless a crisis affecting US forces and/or the PN precludes completion
of those SC activities. **[SC activities normally take place through
bilateral agreements that constitute binding legal obligations for both
the USG and PN]{.underline}**. [As a result, any deviation from the
terms of a bilateral agreement likely requires the consent of both
governments. Consequently, major changes are unlikely during the
execution of a specific SC activity.]{.underline} However, in the
absence of a governing bilateral agreement and with several FYs of SC
activities at various stages of planning, programming, and budgeting
during any given calendar year, this process can make changes for the
future.

#### A Memorandum of Understanding is not binding

<https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mou.asp>\] //CH

[What Is a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU]{.underline})?

[A memorandum of understanding is an agreement between two or more
parties outlined in a formal document]{.underline}. [**It is not legally
binding** but signals the willingness of the parties to move forward
with a contract]{.underline}.

The MOU can be seen as the starting point for negotiations as it defines
the scope and purpose of the talks. [Such memoranda are most often seen
in international treaty negotiations]{.underline} but also may be used
in high-stakes business dealings such as merger talks.

### 2NC -- MoUs =/= Binding

#### MOUs aren't binding

more parties that does not contain an expectation of payment, and under
which the parties do not rely on each other to execute or deliver on any
responsibilities]{.underline}. Support agreements for temporarily
assigning federal civil service personnel between federal entities in
accordance with Section 3341 of Title 5, U.S.C., cannot be executed via
an MOU.

### 2AC C/I -- MoU is part of SC

#### Memorandum of Understandings can be part of security cooperation

#### It's legally binding -- it meets specific standards

**Munoz 18** \[Eugenia Munoz is a Legal Content Writer and paralegal at
LegalVision, with a particular interest in startups and intellectual
property; "Is a Memorandum of Understanding Legally Binding?";
8/17/18/https://legalvision.com.au/memorandum-of-understanding-legally-binding/\]
//CH

A memorandum of understanding (MOU), also referred to as a letter of
intent, heads of agreement or term sheet, can be an extremely useful
commercial tool. Parties use MOUs to quickly and inexpensively set out
the commercial terms of a transaction. They do this ahead of entering
into a formal contract to get the deal moving. [However, is a MOU
legally binding? In this article, we outline some indicators that your
MOU is legally binding]{.underline}.

It's legally binding if it meets these circumstances

[Is it a Final Agreement?]{.underline}

Firstly, [a court will consider whether the parties have actually come
to a final agreement. Often, parties use an MOU when they have commenced
a commercial relationship but are still negotiating specific aspects of
it]{.underline}.

[If it is clear from the document that the parties are still
negotiating, a MOU is probably not legally binding. Phrases such as
"subject to further negotiation" will likely indicate that the parties
have not come to a final agreement. Therefore, you should consider
whether your MOU indicates that you have reached an agreement or that
negotiations are still ongoing.]{.underline}

[Is it a Complete Agreement?]{.underline}

To be legally enforceable, [the MOU must contain all the essential terms
of the agreement. Often, MOUs are not a complete agreement. Parties can
leave several essential terms out because they have not decided on them
yet]{.underline}.

[Essential terms are the terms that parties must finalise before a court
can enforce the agreement]{.underline}. For example, in an agreement
between a gym and a client, the parties must agree to the time frame of
the contract before the agreement is binding. However, deciding on the
brand of the gym equipment is not necessary to enforce the agreement.

Accordingly, [consider whether you have finalised the essential aspects
of your agreement]{.underline}. Ask yourself whether enough information
is present to hold the parties to their promises.

[Was There an Exchange of Promises?]{.underline}

[For the agreement to be legally binding, each party has to promise
something of benefit to the other party, in exchange for something
else]{.underline}. For example, in an agreement for the sale of a car,
the buyer promises money and, in exchange, the seller promises the car.

Often, [MOUs simply outline the common goals and expectations of the
parties. They often use language that indicates discretion of
performance]{.underline}, such as "Party A may" rather than "Party A
will". When the language suggests that a party can choose whether they
hold up their end of the bargain, the MOU is not enforceable. Therefore,
consider what the parties have promised each other and how certain those
promises are.

[Do You Have the Intention to be Legally Bound?]{.underline}

[For the MOU to be binding, it must suggest that the parties intend to
be legally accountable for their promises]{.underline}. To determine
whether this is the case, consider the consequences of a breach.

If there is a lot at stake, it is likely that the parties intend to
receive legal protection. In addition, look for clauses that explicitly
state whether the parties intend for the law to bind them. Some MOUs
expressly include clauses along the lines of "the parties do not intend
to be legally bound by the above terms".

[MOUs often fall under the category of preliminary agreements, or
"agreements to agree"]{.underline}. There are three categories of
intention concerning preliminary agreements, where the parties:

1.  [have come to a complete agreement and intend to be bound
    immediately, but want to rewrite the terms in a detailed
    document;]{.underline}

2.  [have come to a complete agreement but do not intend to perform the
    agreement until they write a formal document; and]{.underline}

3.  [do not intend to be bound by the agreement unless they write a
    contract.]{.underline}

[The first two categories indicate an intention to be legally bound by
the terms of the agreement]{.underline}. If the MOU falls into the third
category, the law will not bind the parties until there is a formal
contract.

## \*\*Cybersecurity\*\*

### CIA Triad -- Precision

#### CIA triad is key to define the scope of cybersecurity law

Jeff **Kosseff**, 20**18**, \"Defining Cybersecurity Law,\" Iowa Law
Review,
https://ilr.law.uiowa.edu/print/volume-103-issue-3/defining-cybersecurity-law/,
accessed 7-16-2022//cpd

In short, [the U.S. legal system lacks a consistent definition of the
term "cybersecurity law."]{.underline} **[This Article aims to fill that
gap]{.underline}** by defining "cybersecurity law." Although
"cybersecurity" is a commonly used term in legal circles[, no
scholarship has stepped back to define exactly what "cybersecurity law"
is and the goals of statutes and regulations that aim to promote
"cybersecurity."]{.underline} [By **defining the scope and goals** of
this new legal field, policymakers can then examine how lawmakers could
improve existing laws.]{.underline} Part II of this Article briefly
describes the cybersecurity challenges that the United States faces by
examining the cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment. [Part III
broadly examines current cybersecurity threats to the United States and
defines **"cybersecurity law" as a legal framework that "promotes the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of public and private
information, systems, and networks,** through the use of forward-looking
regulations and incentives, **with the goal of protecting individual
rights and privacy, economic interests, and national
security."**]{.underline} Part IV of this Article explains the current
U.S. legal regime for cybersecurity and concludes that many of [the most
prominent cybersecurity laws only address a small portion of the broader
legal framework.]{.underline} Part V examines the gaps in current U.S.
cybersecurity law and suggests which areas of cybersecurity law
policymakers could better address.

[Information security is another way of saying "data
security."]{.underline} If you are an information security specialist,
[your concern is for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
your data]{.underline} (this is often referred to as the "CIA"). Most
modern business data resides electronically on servers, desktops,
laptops, or in the cloud---but before all confidential information
migrated online, it was sitting in a filing cabinet. And some
confidential information still is. **[Information security is concerned
with making sure data in any form is kept secure]{.underline}**.

**[Cybersecurity is all about protecting data that is found in
electronic form]{.underline}** (such as computers, servers, networks,
mobile devices, etc.) [**from being compromised or attacked**.
Cybersecurity involves identifying what the critical data is, where it
resides, its risk exposure, and the technology you have to implement in
order to protect it.]{.underline}

### Cybersecurity = Defense

#### Cybersecurity is digital protection from internal and external threats

**IBM ND** \[International Business Machines Corporation is an American
multinational technology corporation with operations in over 171
countries; "What is cybersecurity?"; No date;
<https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity>\] //CH

**[Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and
sensitive information from digital attacks.]{.underline}** Also known as
information technology (IT) security, [cybersecurity measures are
designed to combat threats against networked systems and
applications]{.underline}, whether those threats originate from inside
or outside of an organization.

#### Cybersecurity is the protecting networks from unproved use or the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information

**CISA 19** \[The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is a
United States federal agency, an operational component under Department
of Homeland Security oversight; "What is Cybersecurity?"; 11/14/19;
<https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-001>\] //CH

[Cybersecurity is the art of protecting networks, devices, and data from
unauthorized access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
information]{.underline}. It seems that [everything relies on computers
and the internet now---communication]{.underline} (e.g., email,
smartphones, tablets), [entertainment]{.underline} (e.g., interactive
video games, social media, apps ), [transportation]{.underline} (e.g.,
navigation systems), [shopping]{.underline} (e.g., online shopping,
credit cards), [medicine]{.underline} (e.g., medical equipment, medical
records), and the list goes on. How much of your daily life relies on
technology? How much of your personal information is stored either on
your own computer, smartphone, tablet or on someone else\'s system?

### Cybersecurity = Digital Defense Spending

#### Cooperation with NATO on cybersecurity requires digital defense spending

- This is like not a good card at all

**Maigre 22** \[Merle Maigre is a Senior Fellow with CEPA\'s
Transatlantic Leadership Program and CEPA\'s Digital Innovation
Initiative, and the Senior Cyber Security Expert at Estonia\'s
e-Governance Academy; "NATO's Role in Global Cyber Security"; 4/06/22;
<https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security>\]

This should come with obvious financial and investment implications.
Public debates on burden sharing within NATO for too long have focused
on how much member states spend on defense in isolation, without
adequate prioritizing where those funds are going. [Member states should
be rethink defense spending relative to emerging threats and collective
security challenges]{.underline}. [To ensure funding for cyber security
is appropriately prioritized, NATO should strengthen a commitment to
digital defense spending, building on the strong base it has developed
in terms of doctrine, standards, and requirements]{.underline}.

degree of dominance in cyberspace by one force that permits the secure,
reliable conduct of operations by that force, and its related land, air,
maritime, and space forces at a given time and place without prohibitive
interference by an adversary."40 [**DOD organizations are allowed to
perform** defensive cyber operations; however, full-spectrum cyber
operations (including **offensive cyber operations**) are approved by

## \*\*NATO\*\*

### NATO = Organization

#### NATO is a political and military security alliance formed in 1949

**NATO 20** \[The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an
intergovernmental military alliance; "ABOUT NATO"; Last changed 2020
(addition of 30^th^ country); <https://nato.usmission.gov/about-nato/>\]
//CH

[Formed in 1949 with the signing of the Washington Treaty, **NATO is a
security alliance** of 30 countries from North America and Europe.
NATO's fundamental goal is to safeguard the Allies' freedom and security
by political and military means]{.underline}. NATO remains the principal
security instrument of the transatlantic community and expression of its
common democratic values. It is the practical means through which the
security of North America and Europe are permanently tied together. NATO
enlargement has furthered the U.S. goal of a Europe whole, free, and at
peace.

#### The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a group of 30 countries -- that's external from individual member-states

**NATO 22** \[The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an
intergovernmental military alliance; "10 things you need to know about
NATO"; 5/10/22; <https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/126169.htm>\] //CH

Collective defence: **[The North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO)]{.underline}** was founded in 1949 [and is a group of 30
countries from Europe and North America that exists to protect the
people and territory of its members]{.underline}. The Alliance is
founded on the principle of collective defence, meaning that if one NATO
Ally is attacked, then all NATO Allies are attacked. For example, when
terrorists attacked the United States on 9/11 2001, all NATO Allies
stood with America as though they had also been attacked.

#### Even Canada agrees

SC: Roles and Responsibilities

[Many SC activities require DOD to coordinate with multiple DOD
components]{.underline} and other federal departments, primarily DOS.
Some DOD SC activities require varying levels of coordination with DOS.
Within DOD, the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy (USD\[P\])
exercises overall direction, authority, and control over SC matters.

[The]{.underline} Defense Security Cooperation Agency
([DSCA]{.underline}) [represents the interests of the Secretary of
Defense and]{.underline} USD(P) in SC matters and [is tasked with
directing, administering, and executing many SC programs, developing SC
policy, and providing DOD-wide SC guidance. DSCA is also DOD's main
interlocutor between the PNs, implementing agencies, and the defense
industry.]{.underline} The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special
Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (ASD-SO/LIC) oversees and approves
some SC training activities that are managed by DSCA. U.S. Special
Operations Command (SOCOM) coordinates those SC activities executed by
special operations forces (SOF). DOS leads U.S. foreign aid and has
final say on SA. DOS's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs (PM) is the
principal link to DOD and ensures that SA is integrated with other U.S.
policies and activities at the country, regional, and global levels. PM
also determines PN eligibility, appropriate SA programs, and which
defense articles and equipment are permitted for transfer.
