#### Turkey\'s recent collaboration with Russia undermines NATO cohesion

Russia's firm entrance to the Syrian conflict became a decisive point,
initially leading to strains in ties with Ankara that ran high after
Turkey had shot down a Russian aircraft. Moscow's response consisted in
boosting military involvement in the region and waging the trade war
with Turkey, back then in favor of toppling the government of Bashar
al-Assad. Six months passed since that moment, marking a sharp tilt in
[**Turkish-Russian** relations and prompting the two countries to forget
about past resentments and **start to cooperate**]{.underline}. Ankara
seeks to [foster both an **economic aspect of this partnership**,
including Russian **trade outlets, tourists**, Russian-sourced **gas
and** building **a nuclear power plant**, and a common stance on
Syria.]{.underline} Having no other choice to choose its partners in
Syria's war theater, [Erdogan **focused on bolstering cooperation with
Moscow** and Tehran under the Astana format]{.underline}. Ankara's ties
with Israel have dramatically deteriorated while those with [the
**United States are getting worse** and worse]{.underline}, given that
the latter offers firm support to the Kurds, a useful ally in the war
against the Islamic State in Syria. Also, [Turkey has solidified
cooperation with Qatar]{.underline}, hinting worse relations with Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But what makes matters worse is
[that **this strikes a blow against NATO's internal
cohesion**]{.underline}. Turkey has long made efforts to procure air
defense missile systems; a few years later, the country had almost
sealed the deal with China but had to resign amid pressure from Ankara's
Western allies. Having taken advantage of ever-closer cooperation with
Putin, [Erdogan inked an agreement to purchase Russian
S-400s.]{.underline} Turkey and Russia signed in late 2017 an accord to
supply Ankara with surface-to-air missile batteries, worth \$2.5
billion. Since then, [**Washington had made several unsuccessful
attempts to dissuade Turkey** from acquiring Russian-made military
hardware]{.underline}, also by offering at the end of 2018 to sell air
defense systems Patriot for \$3.5 billion. And Donald Trump is right
when blaming the previous presidential administration for what is taking
place now, with both Barack Obama and the then Congress having impeded
the delivery of Patriots missiles to Ankara. This, along with Turkey's
ever-growing isolation in the West, played to the advantage of Moscow
that cleverly ignited and co-created the conflict between Turkey on the
one hand and the United States and NATO on the other.

#### Inclusion of Turkey in NATO undermines [democracy]{.underline}, [human rights credibility]{.underline}, and [NATO cohesion]{.underline} - kicking Turkey out is the only solution

[Turkey]{.underline}, [as a member of]{.underline} the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization ([NATO]{.underline}), [has **violated every
provision** of NATO's founding treaty **regarding human
rights**.]{.underline}

Indeed, [each [member state is
required](https://www.nato.int/cps/ic/natohq/official_texts_17120.htm?utm_source=Subscribers&utm_campaign=727bf6e08a-UA-5963141-2&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6e846e6217-727bf6e08a-310006173) to]{.underline}
fully [adhere to]{.underline} "...safeguard\[ing\] [the freedom, common
heritage and civilization of their peoples, founded on the principles of
democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law."]{.underline}

To be sure, Erdogan has given himself license to mock these principles
without any noteworthy rebuke from other NATO members.

[It is time to consider **kicking Turkey out of NATO**]{.underline},
regardless of how difficult and complicated this far-reaching measure
may be. [Turkey has long since forsaken Western values]{.underline}
while becoming an increasingly zealous Islamic state.

Indeed, contrary to Erdogan's manipulative narrative about Turkey's
presumed democracy, [the country]{.underline} under his watch [is
governed by an **authoritarian regime** that has **no place among
Western democracies**.]{.underline}

The violation of free press and the systematic undermining of human
rights demands that the West reevaluate its relationship with Turkey and
stop searching for excuses to justify its self-conceit about Erdogan's
outrageous behavior.

**[Erdogan's violations]{.underline}**

Here is a dossier of Erdogan's gross violations of freedom of the press
and his suppression of democratic values:

[Turkey today has become the global **leader of incarcerated
journalists**]{.underline}. The Stockholm Center for Freedom, a
Sweden-based advocacy
agency, [reports](http://stockholmcf.org/updated-list/?utm_source=Subscribers&utm_campaign=727bf6e08a-UA-5963141-2&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6e846e6217-727bf6e08a-310006173) that
as of July 2017 the Turkish government has arrested 228 journalists and
convicted an additional twenty-five.

out of 180** countries]{.underline}.

President Erdogan has all but [**silenced** any **media outlets** that
have attempted any scrutiny of his policies]{.underline}, particularly
his crackdown on anyone whom he perceives to be an enemy. As such, he
has [systematically **denied the Turkish public** any unbiased source of
**information from** domestic **newspapers, radio and
television**.]{.underline}

He uses the criminal justice system to [**prosecute journalists
on [false
charges](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/world/europe/turkey-trial-journalists-terrorism.html?_r=0&utm_source=Subscribers&utm_campaign=727bf6e08a-UA-5963141-2&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6e846e6217-727bf6e08a-310006173)** of
terrorism, insulting the president, or fabricated crimes against the
state.]{.underline}

Many journalists have been [charged and

reporting that the government is supplying weapons to the Islamic State

ISIS' oil being smuggled into the country.

**[Pressuring media organizations]{.underline}**

Erdogan regularly exerts tremendous pressure on various media
organizations to dismiss journalists who write anything critical of the
government, [such
as](https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-prosecutors-accuse-newspaper-of-asymmetric-war-on-erdogan/3798464.html?utm_source=Subscribers&utm_campaign=727bf6e08a-UA-5963141-2&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6e846e6217-727bf6e08a-310006173) those
who worked for the newspaper Cumhuriyet.

Investigative journalism is viewed as treason against the state, which
has de facto choked off any effort by journalists to investigate any
wrongdoing by officials, especially in the rampant number of [corruption
cases](http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/01/06/why-turkeys-mother-of-all-corruption-scandals-refuses-to-go-away/?utm_source=Subscribers&utm_campaign=727bf6e08a-UA-5963141-2&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6e846e6217-727bf6e08a-310006173) that
included several ministers and his own son.

He took over or closed down private media
companies, [including](http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Turkey-seizes-control-of-another-news-agency-close-to-pro-Opposition-cleric-Gulen-447204?utm_source=subscribers&utm_campaign=727bf6e08a-ua-5963141-2&utm_term=0_6e846e6217-727bf6e08a-310006173) Feza
Publications (parent company of Zaman and Cihan), and in many cases
assigned trustees to media organizations, which is absolutely illegal
and against Turkey's own constitution, which he labored so hard to pass.

Many of Turkey's business tycoons, who have extensive media
holdings, [are
given](https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/12/15/silencing-turkeys-media/governments-deepening-assault-critical-journalism?utm_source=Subscribers&utm_campaign=727bf6e08a-UA-5963141-2&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6e846e6217-727bf6e08a-310006173) major
inner-city construction projects in exchange for keeping their reporters
in check and forbidding them from publishing critical commentary about
the government.

He regularly [**targets journalists and media outlets** associated with
the Gülen movement, which the government accuses of being a terrorist
organization.]{.underline}

[[Human Rights Watch
reported](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/12/15/turkey-silencing-media?utm_source=Subscribers&utm_campaign=727bf6e08a-UA-5963141-2&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6e846e6217-727bf6e08a-310006173) that
he **closed nearly 170 media organizations** and publishing outlets
under the state emergency law that was enacted following the failed
military coup in July 2016, severely **undermining every aspect of human
rights and the rule of law.**]{.underline}

**[Targeting Kurdish journalists]{.underline}**

**[Erdogan targeted Kurdish journalists]{.underline}** in particular
[and pro-Kurdish political activists]{.underline} who have expressed
support for Kurdish rights, including prominent academics and mayors,
accusing them of having links to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).

In fact, **[none of the accused committed any
wrongdoing]{.underline}**---[their arrests were arbitrary]{.underline}
and lacked any semblance of legitimacy.

He stifled not only freedom of the press, but free speech in general.
According to the Twitter Transparency Report, Erdogan demanded that
Twitter remove any offending posts.

Of the 33,593 Twitter accounts [reported in
2016](https://transparency.twitter.com/en/removal-requests.html#removal-requests-jan-jun-2016),
over 23,000 were reported by the Turkish government, more than all other
countries put together.

Fearing retribution from the police, even private news outlets no longer
dare to report on anything which is not to the liking of the
government---including demonstrations or clashes related to the Kurdish
problem.

Self-censorship by journalists has become a common practice, while
quietening colleagues who try to protect the basic ethics of journalism.

**[Cracking down on demonstrations]{.underline}**

Given that public demonstration is another form of free expression,
[Erdogan ensures that no demonstration can take place without a specific
permit.]{.underline}

In 2015, a bill
was [passed](https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2015/03/turkey-gives-police-broad-powers-to-repress-dissent/?utm_source=Subscribers&utm_campaign=727bf6e08a-UA-5963141-2&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6e846e6217-727bf6e08a-310006173) allowing
the police to use excessive force to quell demonstrations and
incarcerate those who participate in unauthorized demonstrations for up
to 48 hours, presumably to maintain public order.

[[Protesters](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/explained-turkeys-controversial-security-bill-78658?utm_source=Subscribers&utm_campaign=727bf6e08a-UA-5963141-2&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6e846e6217-727bf6e08a-310006173) wearing
full or even partial masks could face **up to five years in
prison**]{.underline}, especially if they are accused of disseminating
propaganda for terrorist organizations.

[Journalists are
attacked](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/world/europe/turkey-press-erdogan-coup.html?utm_source=Subscribers&utm_campaign=727bf6e08a-UA-5963141-2&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6e846e6217-727bf6e08a-310006173) for
merely advocating for the resumption of peace talks with the PKK, or if
they refer to PKK members as militants rather than terrorists. The
Erdogan government has put freedom of the press under siege, and is bent
on destroying journalism completely.

**[Erdogan's crackdown not limited to Turkey]{.underline}**

Erdogan's crackdown on press freedom, however, is not limited to Turkish
journalists and reporters; it has expanded beyond Turkey's borders.

As a case in point, Turkish consular officials in Rotterdam, the
Netherlands, [asked
Turks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/04/22/hear-someone-insult-erdogan-report-it-to-us-says-turkish-consulate-in-the-netherlands/?utm_campaign=727bf6e08a-UA-5963141-2&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Subscribers&utm_term=.3f1e43585cfd) in
the country to report on any insult directed against Erdogan.

Moreover, Turkey has targeted many foreign journalists, among them a
French photojournalist who was [arrested and
expelled,](https://europeanjournalists.org/blog/2017/06/09/turkey-joint-call-for-journalist-mathias-depardons-immediate-release/?utm_source=Subscribers&utm_campaign=727bf6e08a-UA-5963141-2&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6e846e6217-727bf6e08a-310006173) and
another reporter for a [German television
station](http://www.reuters.com/article/germany-turkey/turkey-denies-entry-to-german-journalist-at-istanbul-airport-idUSL5N17M3LZ?utm_source=Subscribers&utm_campaign=727bf6e08a-UA-5963141-2&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6e846e6217-727bf6e08a-310006173) who
was denied entry into the country.

Turkish state officials have accused European and Western media
organizations of being hypocritical in their representation of the media
in Turkey, as Western states have their own standards of censorship on
sensitive matters related to national security.

Although on a couple of occasions the European Union issued scathing
reports about Turkey's serious backsliding on press freedom, the EU and
the United States (along with the Council of Europe and the UN Human
Rights Council) have unfortunately taken no punitive measures to stop
Erdogan's rampage against free press.

Sadly, [the European community and the United States are **betraying
their democratic values**]{.underline}. They continue to treat Erdogan
with kid gloves because he is presumably an important player against
ISIS, and because he is allowing the United States and its allies to use
Turkey's Incirlik Air Base to launch air attacks against ISIS.

To be sure, **[Erdogan has been successful in blackmailing the
West]{.underline}**. He skillfully uses his leverage to control the flow
of Syrian refugees to Europe and cement Turkey's geostrategic position
as the hub for the transfer of oil and gas to Europe.

[Turkey under Erdogan is not only **violating freedom of the press,
individual liberties**, and the **public's right for peaceful
demonstration**; every stratum of Turkey's governing
authorities---including the **police**, the **judiciary**, the
**bureaucracy** and the political echelon of the AK Party---is corrupt
to the core and irredeemable.]{.underline}

**[Eroding NATO from within]{.underline}**

[NATO **cannot allow one of its member states to erode the alliance**
from within and still expect it to be a viable force that can maintain
and protect European security and its moral values.]{.underline}

[No country led by a dictator]{.underline} that attacks U.S.
allies---such as the Kurds in Syria---**[should remain a member of
NATO]{.underline}**, and no country that sold weapons to ISIS should be
a member of NATO.

No country that cozies up to and [buys
weapons](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/world/europe/turkey-russia-missile-deal.html?utm_source=Subscribers&utm_campaign=727bf6e08a-UA-5963141-2&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6e846e6217-727bf6e08a-310006173) from
America's enemy---Russia---should continue to be a member of NATO, and
no country which is being transformed into an extremist Islamic state by
a zealous leader should maintain its place as a member of NATO.

And [no country that has violated every tenet of democracy]{.underline},
engages in **[gross human rights abuses]{.underline}** and wreaks havoc
on its population deserves to stay in the NATO alliance.

**[Turkey no longer a reliable partner]{.underline}**

[Turkey under Erdogan is no longer a reliable nor trustworthy
partner]{.underline}, and [has become a liability rather than a viable
and constructive member of the organization]{.underline}, which **[could
severely impact NATO's cohesiveness, effectiveness and
preparedness]{.underline}** [to meet any threat to European
security.]{.underline}

For this reason, NATO should warn Erdogan that unless he reverses his
policies and reinstitutes basic democratic principles, especially human
rights and freedom of the press, **[Turkey will be kicked out of
NATO]{.underline}**.

Certainly, I am not holding my breath that NATO will act on this anytime
soon, but I feel very strongly that a discussion on this critical issue
within NATO should take place.

[NATO's **most important challenge** today]{.underline} may not come
from Russia, but **[from within]{.underline}**. With the [number of
disputes **between Turkey and several European allies**]{.underline} yet
again **[on the rise]{.underline}**, the two parties' [souring relations
have begun **undermining the organization's cohesion** and **ability to
make timely collective decisions**]{.underline}. If left unaddressed,
[these tensions **could cause serious damage** to the world's most
powerful alliance.]{.underline}

The latest flashpoint came from [Turkey's open backing of Azerbaijan's
war effort in the small landlocked enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh]{.underline}, which ended abruptly in early November
thanks to a Russian-brokered deal. Reports of military assistance and
alleged Syrian mercenaries sent by Turkey placed Ankara at loggerheads
with its NATO allies' calls for a peaceful, negotiated resolution to the
conflict. [The deal,]{.underline} which foresees Baku reacquiring
sizeable portions of the disputed enclave, [has made Turkey one of the
obvious winners of the recent flare-up]{.underline}, [while its
**Western allies** remain **on the sidelines**]{.underline}. For some,
[this could be **the straw** that **breaks the camel's back**, adding to
a long list of complaints they have recently leveled against their NATO
ally.]{.underline}

BECOME A MEMBER

Last month, [Greece and Turkey came **dangerously close** to a head-on
**naval confrontation** in disputed Eastern Mediterranean waters over
Turkey's gas exploration activities near the Greek island of
Kastellorizo]{.underline}, just a few hundred meters away from the
Turkish coast. Though Turkey later withdrew its ship, [**tensions**
**between** the **two NATO allies** spiked again]{.underline} following
Turkey's announcement that it would send the ship back for a 10-day
seismic research mission in the area, renewing Greek calls for
sanctions. What makes this a particularly explosive situation, of
course, is the two Eastern Mediterranean powers' lingering dispute over
the post-1974 division of Cyprus and the discovery of energy resources
in the area.

[A similar confrontational encounter occurred in June]{.underline} when
[**France and Turkey** nearly came to blows]{.underline} after a French
warship, the Courbet, tried to inspect a Turkish vessel for allegedly
breaching a U.N. arms embargo on Libya --- a claim Ankara fiercely
denies. [**Supporting different sides** in the Libyan Civil
War]{.underline}, the two allies have been engaged in a war of words
over each other's provocative deeds in the Libyan, Syrian and
Nagorno-Karabakh conflicts, as well as over Turkey's territorial claims
in the Mediterranean. The latest spat followed President Emmanuel
Macron's defense of a cartoonist's right to caricature religious figures
in the wake of a teacher's beheading, to which Turkish President Recep
Tayyip Erdoğan responded by calling for a boycott of French products.

[Within NATO, the **escalation in tensions** and growing entanglement of
the two camps' now numerous disputes reflects **European allies'
mounting frustration** over what they perceive as **Turkey's
self-serving and aggressive regional posturing**, and its unwillingness
to consult allies before acting.]{.underline} A NATO member since 1952,
Turkey has always occupied a somewhat unique role in the alliance. Its
size, military resources, and key position at the doorstep of Asia ---
in other words, as NATO's southern flank --- give it important strategic
relevance within the context of renewed interest in the Middle East.
Though relations have often been fragile, especially since the 2016 coup
attempt, [the current rift marks **a new low in** the recent **history
of the alliance**]{.underline}, with potentially damaging consequences.
Given this backdrop, NATO should take advantage of its own resources to
try to address its members' deteriorating relations, and work to
reconcile their diverging security interests. This is a lot easier said
than done, but it may be the only option to prevent a more fundamental
rupture in the relationship.

Divided We Stand

As tensions grow, [a key risk for NATO relates to the
crisis']{.underline} **[potential to hamper its cohesion]{.underline}**
[and ability to act decisively]{.underline}, as [the alliance **relies
on the principle of consensus** to successfully operate]{.underline}.
Every major NATO decision embodies the collective will of all allies and
results, therefore, from a complex but fragile process of negotiation
wherein nations are invited to compromise on matters of mutual interest.
[The inevitable drawback to this is that every ally possesses a de facto
right to **veto any NATO issue** if its demands are not met, which they
may be incentivized to use as leverage to pursue national
interests.]{.underline} The same can be said of the European Union,
which operates on unanimity and where Cyprus recently made headlines for
blocking sanctions on Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's
regime, insisting on the imposition of E.U. measures on Turkey for its
energy exploration in Mediterranean waters. The European Union was
criticized for failing to agree on timely sanctions.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip [Erdogan lamented on Wednesday that the
**Scandinavian countries had become a "centre for the emergence of
terrorism**" and stressed that Ankara had "made clear its conditions" to
Finland and Sweden to allow these countries to join NATO to perform
.]{.underline}

"We made it clear," he assured, before reiterating that Turkey's terms
include those countries ending the activities of terrorist organizations
in their respective territories and allowing suspected terrorists to be
deported to Turkey.

In this regard, he pointed out that Ankara "provided the list" of
members of organizations such as the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the
Democratic Union Party (PYD), the People's Defense Units (YPG) and the
FETO. Turkey is referring to the "Hizmet" movement of cleric Fetulá
Gulen, whom it accuses of being behind the 2016 coup attempt. "You have
to return them," he said.

Erdogan regrets that the Scandinavian countries have become "centres for
the spawn of terrorism".

"They even nurture these terrorist organizations in their parliaments,
like in a breeding center. If they do not keep their promises, it will
not be possible for us to continue to positively approach the issue of
these countries joining NATO," he said.

**[Erdogan is again threatening to veto Sweden and Finland's NATO
membership]{.underline}**

It has also been argued that "almost all Scandinavian countries have
become centers of terrorism", as have countries like Germany, France,
the Netherlands, the UK and Italy. "[The West currently has no right to
speak on this matter]{.underline}," he said.

During the NATO summit in Madrid at the end of June, [Erdogan called on
Finland and Sweden to "do their part]{.underline}" in the fight against
terrorism and **[accused them of harboring terrorists.]{.underline}**

Amid all of this "more," both supporters and opponents of greater U.S.
commitment to Europe have talked about possible Finnish and Swedish
membership as if it was just another step in the alliance's established
process of expansion. But [adding the two Nordic nations to the bloc
could be an opportunity for far more: These countries could
**fundamentally transform NATO** in ways that **expand Washington's

study](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1253.html#:~:text=In%20a%20series%20of%20war,of%20its%20most%20exposed%20members.) found
that Russian troops would [enter the Estonian and Latvian capitals in 60
hours at most.]{.underline}

Swedish and Finnish NATO membership would transform the security
challenge of the Baltics overnight. [The **Baltic Sea** would
immediately become **a [NATO
lake](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-06-30/nato-turkey-s-nod-to-finland-and-sweden-create-a-baltic-lake-to-buttress-east)**;
any Russian **hope for sea control would be gone**, with the Swedish
island of Gotland serving as an especially formidable **barrier to
Russian air and naval forces.**]{.underline}

[A strategically sound and cost-effective defense of the Baltic states
should not pile NATO brigades into a salient that can easily be cut off
and surrounded. Instead, **it should rest on deterrence**, which
requires a credible commitment to a counteroffensive that would push
back and destroy invading Russian forces.]{.underline}

[Finnish and Swedish ground forces, though they would take time to
mobilize, could be mustered and **deployed far more quickly than**
Western European** [armored
brigades](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1629.html)**.]{.underline}
They could also advance on a wholly new axis of attack: St. Petersburg,
Russia, lies barely 110 miles from the Finnish border. Finnish and
Swedish NATO membership would thus allow a resolute U.S. president to
deny misguided Baltic requests for a forward-stationed U.S. garrison by
pointing to a boost in conventional deterrence from NATO's new members.

European NATO members' free-riding---or getting their security on the
cheap---has incensed U.S. presidents since [John F.
Kennedy](https://warontherocks.com/2019/03/the-transatlantic-tussle-a-historical-case-study-on-how-to-handle-nato/).
Only nine NATO members currently meet the alliance's stated target of
spending at least 2 percent of GDP on defense. In hard military terms,
most NATO members aren't war horses but [show
ponies](https://blog.usni.org/posts/2021/03/17/an-alliances-four-quadrants).

That cannot be said of Finland and Sweden. Although Sweden has yet to
reach the 2 percent threshold, both countries have [dramatically
increased](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/10/sweden-announces-plan-for-significant-boost-in-military-spending) their [defense
spending](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-05/finland-adds-2-2-billion-defense-spending-in-shadow-of-war) over
the past decade. Should they join the alliance, Finland and Sweden would
be immediate security contributors, not security consumers. This claim
could not credibly be made for any new member since the end of the Cold
War.

The Finns and Swedes are among the very few European militaries that
boast both military quantity and quality. Unlike almost all of NATO,
Finland and Sweden have military conscription, which provides both a
huge trained reserve and a
society [committed](https://www.dw.com/en/finland-wins-admirers-with-all-inclusive-approach-to-defense/a-40806163) to
national defense. (Sweden restored conscription in 2018 after an
eight-year hiatus.) The Finnish military has a wartime strength of
280,000 troops and a reserve of nearly 1 million people. A [2015
poll](https://web.archive.org/web/20180308220929/https:/www.gallup-international.bg/en/Publications/2015/220-WIN-Gallup-International%E2%80%99s-global-survey-shows-three-in-five-willing-to-fight-for-their-country) of
64 countries found that Finns were the most willing to defend their
country of any European nation surveyed, with the Swedes not far behind.
The Finnish and Swedish populations have skin in the game in a
fundamental way, which could serve as a benchmark within NATO once the
two countries are in the alliance.

Both countries also field cutting-edge equipment and capabilities.
With [1,500 artillery and rocket
systems](https://warontherocks.com/2022/05/what-would-finland-bring-to-the-table-for-nato/),
Finland has one of Europe's strongest artillery forces---a key to modern
warfare, as the battle of attrition in Ukraine's Donbas has again
proved. Swedish fighter jets and diesel-electric submarines are some of
the most advanced in the world. In December 2021, Finland announced it
was ordering 64 U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets---relative to population,
the equivalent of 3,840 F-35s for the United States.

Most importantly, Finland and Sweden are joining NATO for reasons of
pure security---not, as in previous NATO expansion rounds, as an entrée
into the trans-Atlantic community or validation of political reforms.
Finnish and Swedish admission would strengthen NATO in hard-power terms
and restore its role as a fundamentally military-focused alliance
against an overriding security threat. It would mark a long-overdue
return to NATO's core and founding mission.

With the blunting of Russian conventional military power in Ukraine and
Moscow's generational task to resupply and modernize its shambolic
military, it has become clear that European security can be an almost
wholly European responsibility. Indeed, given the magnitude of China's
challenge in the Pacific and the United States' [deteriorating
position](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/first-strike-chinas-missile-threat-to-u-s-bases-to-asia) there,
European security urgently needs to be a European responsibility.
[Washington's nuclear umbrella will remain, but the burden of
conventional deterrence and warfighting in Europe should rest on
European NATO members.]{.underline} Finnish and Swedish [NATO membership
can be a critical step toward making the alliance self-sufficient and
opening a path to a responsible U.S. drawdown from the current U.S.
military posture in Europe.]{.underline}

[The addition of Finland and Sweden to the alliance could **enable a
major**---if belated---**U.S. strategic reorientation to the
Pacific.**]{.underline}

[The European defense of Europe that Finland and Sweden make possible is
the solution to the strategic dilemma the United States
faces.]{.underline} Although there has been talk of transforming NATO
into a looming contest with China---of which adding Beijing to the
Strategic Concept is the latest manifestation---[this effort is [doomed
to
fracture](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/skeptics/nato%E2%80%99s-new-purpose-alliance-reborn-take-china-174488)]{.underline} along
a thousand lines. [The military structures are simply not in place for a
two-theater effort,]{.underline} and there is no political will in
Europe to be a junior partner in the United States' struggle against
China.

The latest, most violent phase of Russian revanchism has increased
Europe's perceived [security
needs](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/05/18/nato-sweden-finland-russia-balance-threat/).
Despite Russia's military struggles since February, the United States is
facing increasing calls to defend Europe directly, especially in the
Baltics. Doing so would require substantial resources: One study found
the job could be done with [seven
brigades](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1253.html),
one-fifth of the entire active-duty U.S. Army.

This is not just a problem of force structure or military spending. The
commitment to bear the majority of the burden in opposing both the
Russian and Chinese militaries prevents military doctrine, weapons
acquisition, training, and many other aspects of defense from cohering
around a single, specific strategic problem. At the height of the Cold
War, it was the specificity of the Soviet threat as a [continental
power](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE301.html) that guided
the U.S. Army and Air Force to create and implement the transformational
AirLand Battle doctrine. China's challenge to the United States is
primarily naval and of an entirely different nature.

The Biden administration seems to hope that a pivot to Europe now will
somehow later support a pivot back to Asia. On the same day that Finnish
and Swedish accession moved forward after Turkish acquiescence, the
White House announced
the [deployment](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3078087/biden-announces-changes-in-us-force-posture-in-europe/) of
more U.S. troops to Europe and the construction of a new corps
headquarters in Poland. There is probably less than meets the eye to
these moves, but the additional destroyers to be home-ported in Spain
and the F-35 fighters being stationed in Britain are exactly the kinds
of weapons the Pacific theater demands. It's an odd paradox: At the same
moment that NATO's European side is growing dramatically in size and
readiness, the United States has chosen to do more in Europe, not less.

Since the end of the Cold War, despite browbeating and
even [threats](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/22/trump-says-he-threatened-not-defend-nato-russia/),
no U.S. president from any party has been able or willing to insist that
Europe be defended primarily by Europeans. [The addition of Finland and
Sweden to the alliance could enable a major]{.underline}---if
belated---**[U.S. strategic reorientation to the Pacific]{.underline}**.
The Madrid NATO summit indicated that this is currently unlikely. But it
is not too late for a visionary U.S. administration to grasp the
geopolitical opportunity offered by this unique moment for the
trans-Atlantic alliance.

#### Turkey is messing with Swinland accession!

Accessed -- 7/20/2022, WWIS

**[Erdogan]{.underline}** on Monday once again **[threatened to derail
Finland and Sweden\'s NATO ambitions]{.underline}**.

[Turkey has accused the Nordic countries of being too friendly with
Kurdish groups it considers to be terrorists]{.underline}.

[Erdogan\'s warning came a day before he met with Putin in
Iran.]{.underline}

[Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday once again threatened
to stand in the way of Finland and Sweden joining NATO --- a day before
he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Iran.]{.underline}

\"[I would like to remind once again that if these countries do not take
the necessary steps to fulfill our conditions, **we will freeze the
(accession) process**]{.underline},\" [Erdogan said in a televised
addressed, per the Associated Press. \"Our stance on this issue is very
clear. The rest is up to them.\"]{.underline}

[Turkey has accused the Nordic countries of being **too friendly with
Kurdish** militant groups **it considers to be terrorists**, while also
taking issue with **embargoes on arms exports**. Along these lines,
Turkey]{.underline} initially said [it would **block Finland and
Sweden** from joining the alliance. NATO enlargement requires unanimous
agreement from all current members.]{.underline} But Turkey dropped its
objections last month after coming to an agreement with Finland and
Sweden.

\"Turkey, Finland and Sweden have signed a memorandum that addresses
Turkey\'s concerns, including around arms exports and the fight against
terrorism,\" NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said at the time.

After both Scandinavian countries submitted applications and Turkey said
it was dropping its objections, NATO formally invited Finland and Sweden
to join the alliance in late June. The next step in the process is for
the legislatures of all 30 members to ratify Finland and Sweden\'s
accession.

Finland and Sweden --- two historically neutral or militarily
non-aligned countries --- moved to join NATO as a direct response to
Russia\'s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, marking one of the most
significant consequences of Putin acting on his imperialistic ambitions.
Indeed, Russia\'s war has unified the West in historic ways.

[But **autocratic leaders like Erdogan** who **hold sway in NATO** ---
but tend to **count Putin as a friend** --- **have exposed cracks**
in]{.underline} that **[unity]{.underline}**.

[As he met with Putin and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in
Iran]{.underline} on Tuesday, [Erdogan once again zeroed in on Kurdish
militant groups.]{.underline}

[During a joint press conference with Raisi, the Turkish president said
militias cause \"great trouble\" for both Iran and Turkey. \"We should
fight against these terrorist organisations in solidarity and
alliance,\" he said, per the Moscow Times.]{.underline}

[Turkey has been **targeting Kurdish militants** in Syria, where the
Russian military exerts heavy influence, for years. The **US and other
Western countries** have **collaborated** closely **with the Kurdish-led
Syrian Democratic Forces** in the fight against ISIS. This has
**increased tensions** between Ankara and the West, and it\'s an **issue
at the heart of** Erdogan\'s repeated **threats to derail Finland and
Sweden\'s** NATO ambitions.]{.underline}

[While in Iran, Erdogan was expected to urge Putin to permit grain
exports from Ukraine in order to alleviate an escalating global food
crisis catalyzed by Russia\'s blockade on Ukrainian ports. Ukraine,
often characterized as Europe\'s breadbasket, is a major exporter of
wheat, sunflower oil, and corn.]{.underline}

[The EU has decried Russia\'s blockade on Ukrainian food exports as a
\"war crime,\" as experts warn that the Kremlin is deliberately
attempting to provoke famine in poorer countries as part of its broader
strategy to win its unprovoked war in Ukraine. The Kremlin has denied
that it\'s at fault, blaming the situation on Ukraine and Western
sanctions.]{.underline}

[Last week, Istanbul served as the venue for talks between Ukrainian and
Russian negotiators on grain exports from Ukraine. As they met in
Tehran, **Putin thanked Erdogan** for his efforts to mediate the talks.
\"With your mediation, **we have moved forward**,\" Putin said to his
Turkish counterpart, the Moscow Times reported. \"Not all issues have
yet been resolved, but the fact that there is movement is already
good.\"]{.underline}

### 2NC -- AT: Radars -- Iran

#### The US can [track]{.underline} Iranian missiles -- we have satellites to cover the [entire]{.underline} globe

**Oberhaus '20** \[Daniel; 01/08/20; staff writer at WIRED; "How the US
Knew Iranian Missiles Were Coming Before They Hit," WIRED,
<https://www.wired.com/story/us-missile-defense-iranian-strike/> smarx,
AZG\]

ON TUESDAY, [IRAN launched]{.underline} more than [a dozen missiles
targeting two Iraqi military bases housing American
soldiers.]{.underline} The attack was retaliation for the US drone
strike that killed Qasem Soleimani, a top-ranking Iranian military
general. In a televised speech on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said
"minimal damage was sustained" during the attack and that no American or
Iraqi lives were lost. Considering that Iran has developed missiles that
are accurate to within a few tens of meters, it's remarkable that all
personnel at the base emerged unscathed.

According to Trump, this had nothing to do with luck or bad aim.
Instead, he attributed it to "[an early warning system]{.underline} that
**[worked very well."]{.underline}** [The US has a vast network of
radars and satellites dedicated to tracking missile launches **around
the globe,**]{.underline} [which allowed troops stationed at the Iraqi
bases to take cover before the missiles struck their
targets]{.underline}. The system worked as intended, but as the missile
technology of America's adversaries continues to improve, some experts
wonder if the country's first line of defense will be able to keep up.

America's missile warning system harkens back to the early days of the
Cold War, when the threat of a Soviet nuclear attack kept the world on
edge. [By the]{.underline} early 19[60s]{.underline}, [the US had a
network of a dozen ground-based radars concentrated around the Arctic
and several **infrared satellites** capable of **detecting the
launches** of Russian]{.underline} intercontinental ballistic
[missiles]{.underline} that could deliver a nuclear warhead to the US
mainland. [The ground-based radars would constantly send pulses of
high-frequency radio waves toward the horizon; if a missile was
launched, the radio waves would be reflected off the missile back to the
radar antenna, while the satellites would **search for heat signatures**
from the missiles.]{.underline}

Although the fundamental methods for detecting a missile launch haven't
changed all that much in the past 50 years, [today's missile warning
systems are vastly **more accurate and responsive**]{.underline}. One of
the biggest improvements in early warning technology has been [seen in
space systems, which keep a constant watch for missile launches **across
the entire globe**.]{.underline} At present, [the US has four
missile-tracking infrared satellites in geosynchronous
orbits]{.underline}---meaning [they never change position relative to
the surface of the Earth]{.underline}---[and two]{.underline} additional
[infrared missile detection systems]{.underline} likely [hosted
on]{.underline} classified National Reconnaissance Office
[satellites.]{.underline} [In the case of the Iranian attack, it was
almost certainly one of these satellites that gave the military a
heads-up that missiles were on their way.]{.underline}

"It must have been space-based or a manned aircraft," says Riki Ellison,
founder and chair of the nonprofit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance.
"Radars are limited by the horizon and mountains so you won't be able to
detect a missile until it clears a certain elevation. You need something
directly overhead."

Once a satellite detects a possible missile launch, it triggers an alert
at the Missile Warning Center, run by the US Space Command out of the
Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station in Colorado. There, military
analysts work to confirm that the detection is legit and process the
trajectory of the missile to determine where it will strike. With this
information in hand, Space Command can determine whether a missile
intercept is possible or necessary. How long the whole process takes,
from detection to direction, depends on the launch location and target.
[In the]{.underline} case of the [Iranian attack,]{.underline} [US
officials say troops had **hours of advance warning**]{.underline} of an
impending attack from communication and signals intelligence, but the
warning after the missile launch was likely only a few minutes. No
attempt was made to intercept the missile; instead, troops at the
targeted bases were ordered to disperse.

[The US missile warning system works great for ballistic missiles **like
those used by Iran**]{.underline}, [whose trajectories can be calculated
with an **extremely high degree** of accuracy]{.underline} once they're
launched. It's not well equipped to handle newer kinds of missiles.
"What we're seeing is the threats becoming more complex, and the
complexity manifests in terms of maneuverability," says Tom Karako,
director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.

[More advanced missiles are able to change their
trajectories]{.underline} mid-flight, which means "it won't be in the
place you think it's going to be if you're trying to engage it," says
Karako, who says maneuverable missile technology is within reach of
Iran. Other US adversaries have still more advanced missiles like
so-called "hypersonic glide vehicles" that take off like a normal
missile and glide through the atmosphere at relatively low altitudes.

Defending against the combination requires the ability to continuously
track a missile that is modifying its course and flying at relatively
low altitudes. Right now that's a sort of blind spot for the US early
warning system. Radars are good at tracking objects well above the
horizon, less so lower-flying hypersonic missiles, while satellites can
detect a launch and calculate a trajectory, but not track an object
during its flight (although two satellites currently in orbit are
testing this capability).

[The]{.underline} US **[D]{.underline}**epartment **[o]{.underline}**f
**[D]{.underline}**efense is [well aware of these
shortcomings]{.underline}, and [is making a concerted effort to **update
its technology**]{.underline}. In 2018, [the Air Force awarded Northrop
Grumman]{.underline} an [\$866 million]{.underline}, five-year contract
[to upgrade three ground-based warning radar systems]{.underline} in the
US. Last year, [Congress approved a \$160 million budget transfer to
accelerate]{.underline} the development of a new generation of five
missile-[tracking satellites]{.underline}, the first of which is
expected [to launch in 2025.]{.underline}

Ellison says he also expects [artificial intelligence to play a
**greater role** in America's missile warning system]{.underline} as the
number of threats proliferates. "We've got to move faster, we can't do
the old school manual check out," he says. Indeed, the US military is
considering the use of machine learning to accelerate response times.

The Iranian missile attack was a grave reminder of the importance of a
robust early warning system---its critical role in saving American and
Iraqi lives may well have prevented the loss of countless others

#### [New bipartisan]{.underline} legislation will pass to [monitor]{.underline} Iranian missile threats -- there's [growing]{.underline} congressional support

//smarx, AZG\]

[**Democratic and Republican** lawmakers]{.underline} have [introduced a
bill requiring the]{.underline} US [administration to **assess Iranian
threats**]{.underline} and [develop a **clear strategy** to deal with
them.]{.underline}

The \"Iran Nuclear Weapons Capability Monitoring Act of 2022\" was
presented by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez
and Senator Lindsey Graham.

[The act calls for establishing a task force to monitor Iran\'s nuclear
weapons]{.underline} and missile capabilities [and]{.underline} urges
the Biden administration [to **coordinate intelligence cooperation**
with regional allies like Israel.]{.underline}

[The **bipartisan** legislation requires]{.underline} that the Secretary
of State submit [an annual diplomatic strategy for **engaging with
partners and allies** of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[regarding Iran\'s nuclear weapons]{.underline} and missile activities.

[The bill highlights the **growing congressional
opposition**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} the [Biden]{.underline}
administration[\'s]{.underline} [efforts to return to the nuclear deal
with Tehran, including top Democratic members.]{.underline}

[Menendez said there is **no reason** why]{.underline} the US [Congress
should not receive the most **up-to-date** information about Iran\'s
nuclear]{.underline} and ballistic missile [activities]{.underline} [or
the administration\'s diplomatic efforts to address the
threats]{.underline} they posed.

Republican Senator [Graham said]{.underline} [that no matter what
happens]{.underline} with the Iran nuclear negotiations, [\"we must
monitor the Iranian nuclear program **like a hawk.\"**]{.underline}

### 2NC -- AT: Radars -- Israel

#### Israel will [never]{.underline} attack Iran -- too many political and military [constraints]{.underline}

**Safael '21** \[Sajjad; 09/17/21; postdoc fellow at Germany's Max
Planck Institute for Social Anthropology; \"Israel Isn't Strong Enough
to Attack Iran,\" Foreign Policy,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/09/17/israel-isnt-strong-enough-to-attack-iran/>
smarx, AZG\]

To be sure, [Israel has in the past carried out relatively limited
operations against Iran]{.underline}---such as raids on Iranian allies
in Syria and nuclear sabotage---and may continue to do so in the future.
[But to what extent should we believe]{.underline} Tel [Aviv is truly
ready and willing to launch a strike on Iran because of advances in the
Iranian nuclear program]{.underline}, [**knowing full well** that this
is likely to push the two countries and their allies into
war]{.underline}? [The]{.underline} **[political and military
constraints]{.underline}** [on Israeli decision-makers
suggest]{.underline}s such [a military showdown is **highly
unlikely.**]{.underline}

[To speak of an imminent]{.underline} and undisguised IDF
[strike]{.underline} deep inside Iranian territory [is to overlook a
**long-established norm**]{.underline} [that has for **decades governed
U.S.-Israel relations**]{.underline}: [Israel cannot simply ignore the
**wishes and concerns** of its chief patron, especially when core U.S.
foreign policy priorities are at stake.]{.underline}

[This norm was expressed in clear terms by]{.underline} no less a figure
[than Israel's former premier and Defense Minister]{.underline} Ehud
Barak in his autobiography My Country, My Life. Here, [Barak spelled out
the paradigm that]{.underline} has shaped---and [will]{.underline}
likely continue to [shape]{.underline}---the contours of [Israeli
action]{.underline} against Iran. "There were only two ways," he
explained, that Israel could stop the Iranians from getting a nuclear
weapon (read: "nuclear program," for Barak willfully ignores U.S.
intelligence assessments that Iran had halted pursuits for nuclear
weapons in 2003). One way was "for the Americans to act." The only other
option was "for \[the United States\] not to hinder Israel from doing
so."

But according to Barak, ["hinder" is precisely what consecutive U.S.
administrations have done---and are still likely to do.]{.underline}

[Even during the military interventionism of the]{.underline} George W.
[Bush presidency, Israel did not have a blank check to do as it
pleased.]{.underline} As Barak notes in his memoirs, when Bush learned
in 2008 of Israeli efforts to purchase heavy munitions from the United
States, he confronted Barak and then-premier Ehud Olmert. "I want to
tell both of you now, as president," [Bush warned, "We are **totally
against** any action by you to mount an attack on the \[Iranian\]
nuclear plants."]{.underline}

"I repeat," Bush further clarified, "in order to avoid any
misunderstanding. [We expect you not to do]{.underline} it. And [we're
not going to do it, either]{.underline}, as long as I am president. I
wanted it to be clear." It deserves mention that according to Barak,
Bush issued this warning despite knowing that Israel did not even
possess the military capacity to assault Iran at the time.

According to Barak, [this staunch opposition to a strike on Iran had a
"dramatic" effect on him]{.underline} and Olmert [since the]{.underline}
Bush [administration had supported Israel']{.underline}s 2007 [bombing
of Syria's]{.underline} nascent nuclear [program just a year
before]{.underline}. In both cases, [Washington's approval]{.underline},
or lack thereof, [was **demonstrably consequential.**]{.underline}

Barak's memoirs show that [the same dynamic continued to
govern]{.underline} U.S.-Israel relations [during Obama's
presidency.]{.underline} He recalls how then-U.S. Secretary of Defense
Leon Panetta "made no secret of the fact he didn't want us to launch a
military strike" at a time when the [Obama]{.underline} administration
[was focused on putting international **political and economic**
pressure on Iran]{.underline}. [Panetta "urged me to 'think twice, three
times,' before going down that road]{.underline}," Barak wrote, and saw
it as a given that Tel Aviv would keep Washington abreast of its
decisions. "If you do decide to attack the Iranian facilities, when will
we know?" he allegedly asked Barak.

According to Barak's account[, Israel was **dissuaded from going
forward** with a supposed strike on Iran]{.underline}'s nuclear
installations in summer 2012 "[because of the **damage** it would do to
our ties with the United States]{.underline}." [Washington's demands
continued to limit]{.underline} Tel [Aviv after the]{.underline}
finalization of the [nuclear deal in]{.underline} 20[15]{.underline}.
Even then, Barak recalls, [the Israelis could not simply act against
Iran without a green light]{.underline} from the Obama administration:
"We needed to reach agreement with the Americans about what kind of
military strike we, or they, might have to take if the Iranians again
moved to get nuclear weapons."

As evinced by Barak's autobiography, U.S. presidents are not taciturn
about making their views and wishes known to Israeli officials,
especially when primary U.S. foreign policy objectives are involved.
[Nor can Tel Aviv **afford to ignore** Washington's express
demands]{.underline} and concerns on such matters. And today, [any
flagrant Israeli violation of Iranian sovereignty will instantly clash
with two mutually reinforcing goals that have come to **define the Biden
administration's** foreign policy]{.underline}: [curbing Iran's nuclear
program through **non-military means**]{.underline} (efforts currently
focused on reviving the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal) [and **winding down**
U.S. military presence in the Middle East.]{.underline}

[These **political realities** make it unlikely Israel will pursue an
overt strike on Iran. Just as important]{.underline}, however, [are the
military constraints]{.underline} that [Israel faces.]{.underline}

To be sure, even without its ready-to-launch nuclear warheads, Israel is
more than capable of delivering swift and devastating blows to Iran's
armed forces, both in the skies and seas. Its fleet of American fighter
jets and bombers alone can irreparably trounce Iran's air defenses as
well as its dilapidated air force. Even Iran's increasingly powerful,
accurate, and far-reaching missile and drone systems don't radically
alter the balance of power in the skies. In short, in terms of military
hardware, the IDF's superiority over Iran's armed forces is
indisputable, not to mention otherworldly.

But this [prodigious superiority will be rendered far less consequential
in]{.underline} the event of [an all-out war that lures the IDF ground
forces into the battlefield]{.underline}. Why? [Ever since the IDF's
embarrassing defeat during the]{.underline} 20[06 war with
Hezbollah]{.underline}, [Israel]{.underline}'s top military brass [have
become acutely aware that the country's land forces are **ill-prepared**
for a full-scale war with a fighting force even **moderately capable**
of packing a punch.]{.underline}

[As shown by]{.underline} Israel's own scathing inquiry into
[the]{.underline} 20[06]{.underline} [war]{.underline}, [as well as
reports by the Washington Institute]{.underline} for Near East Policy
and the U.S. Army, [the 33-day war with Hezbollah
demonstrated]{.underline} that the [IDF ground forces had been
**woefully ill-prepared** to fight a **real war** with a formidable
foe.]{.underline}

Since then, [there have been some signs of remedial
measures]{.underline} undertaken by the IDF to address its shortcomings.
[Still, there is little reason to believe its ground forces have
undergone a **drastic improvement**]{.underline} since the 2006 war.
Unsurprisingly, [when]{.underline} Gadi [Eizenkot began his
tenure]{.underline} as Chief of General Staff of the IDF [a few months
after]{.underline} Protective Edge ([the]{.underline} 20[14]{.underline}
Gaza [War)]{.underline}, [he]{.underline} reportedly "[found the ground
forces in **rather bad shape**]{.underline}" [and "an army that had
gotten **fat** in]{.underline} ... [all the wrong places]{.underline} in
the decade after the Second Lebanon War." [The picture
looked]{.underline} more or less [the same in]{.underline} late
20[18]{.underline} [when the]{.underline} outgoing ombudsman of the
Israeli [Defense Ministry]{.underline} Maj. Gen. (res.) Yitzhak Brick
[warned lawmakers]{.underline} in a "contentious" meeting [that the
country's ground forces were **unprepared** for a future
war.]{.underline}

[Mindful of the gaping chink in the IDF's armor]{.underline}, [Israel's
highest]{.underline} military and political echelons [are **unlikely to
order** an overt military operation inside Iranian territory, knowing
full well that]{.underline} such [an assault will most likely lock
Israel and Iran in an irreversible spiral of escalation that promises to
pit]{.underline} [ill-prepared IDF ground troops against Iranian forces
and]{.underline} their [regional allies such as
**Hezbollah.**]{.underline}

But if Washington's red light and Tel Aviv's own military calculus
render a flagrant violation of Iranian sovereignty by the IDF unlikely,
then what is to account for [the public]{.underline}, at times even
garish, [saber-rattling]{.underline} emanating from Israeli statesmen?
Such threats [are partly **tailored for domestic
consumption**]{.underline}. [In a highly militarized social
context]{.underline} that has [in recent decades]{.underline} steadily
drifted toward the far-right, [talk of bombing Iran may be an effort to
**not appear weak** before one's political rivals.]{.underline}

[It may also be read,]{.underline} however, [as a]{.underline}
**[bargaining posture]{.underline}** [to strengthen Israel's position
vis]{.underline}-à-vis the [Biden]{.underline} administration [on issues
far closer to home than the Iranian nuclear program. By]{.underline}
continuously [breathing life into the specter of striking
Iran]{.underline}---[a source of **great unease** in
West]{.underline}ern capitals due its catastrophic
ramifications---[Israeli leaders can offer to forgo their
**non-existent** plans to enter an all-out war with Iran **in return for
other gains:**]{.underline} [Biden **dropping his opposition** to
illegal settlement expansion]{.underline} in the occupied territories (a
secondary issue for the United States) [as well as more military and
financial aid.]{.underline}
