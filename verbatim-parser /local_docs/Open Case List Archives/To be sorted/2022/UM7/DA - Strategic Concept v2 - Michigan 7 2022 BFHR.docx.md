Operationally, **[[NATO]{.mark} has [announced]{.mark} a [significant
hardening of]{.mark} its [defence and deterrence posture]{.mark} to be
able to 'defend every inch of Allied territory']{.underline}** and
recommitted to a 360-degree approach to security through several
enhancements. First, there is a doubling from four to eight
multinational battlegroups in Eastern Europe, which has already led to a
near-tenfold increase in troops deployed to the Eastern flank. Moreover,
these battlegroups will soon include brigade headquarters to rapidly
scale up posture if necessary, with associated NATO reinforcement plans
at 'short and no notice'. Second, the NATO Response Force (NRF) has been
expanded from 40,000 to over 300,000 troops, to be held at higher levels
of readiness. Third, in a complete antithesis to President Vladimir
Putin's intent, Sweden and Finland will now be able to join the
Alliance, after Turkey withdrew its objections in time for Madrid,
significantly enhancing political unity. The eventual accession of
Finland and Sweden will expand the Supreme Allied Commander Europe's
(SACEUR) land area of operations by over 866,000 square kilometres. It
also changes the European security architecture in more subtle ways. For
example, it means that seven out of eight Arctic Council members will
also be NATO members, changing the dynamic at a time when NATO needs to
cooperate with Russia on climate security, which is also heavily
stressed in the new Strategic Concept. Moreover, **[NATO and the EU are
now more closely aligned]{.underline}** in terms of their membership --
only Austria, Cyprus, Ireland and Malta are members of the EU but not
NATO -- at exactly the moment when European states need to step up
defensively. These announcements are politically momentous, but also
entail a huge risk. **[The [big troop increases will be very
expensive]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[as member states]{.underline}**
**[experience]{.underline}** increasing **[spending
pressures]{.underline}**[. **[If]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[these
statements are [not backed up]{.mark}]{.underline}** (there are a total
of 71 'we will' commitments across 11 pages), **[the [Alliance could
lose trust and credibility]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[and]{.mark}
therefore [effective deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[There is also
the [real possibility of]{.mark} [opening old wounds]{.mark} on burden
sharing]{.underline}**, **[especially [between]{.mark} the US and
European [allies, which could]{.mark} further [destabilise the
Alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}**, especially if a Trump-like character is
able to secure election to the White House in 2024. European security
documents and communiques, both from NATO and the EU, are graveyards of
unrealised rapid reaction force ambitions which were luckily never
tested by the security environment. It is politically unacceptable to
Eastern members to continue to tolerate this risk. There are already
reports that cast real doubt on the ability to realise the new force
model. How Much Does the Strategic Concept Actually Matter?
**[Politically, the Strategic [Concept and]{.mark} the [unity]{.mark} it
represents [are very important]{.mark}]{.underline}**. However,
militarily and operationally, it is less significant. The 2010 Strategic
Concept had been moribund since at least 2014, following Russia's
annexation of Crimea, but of course NATO has still been operating
effectively since. While **[a lot of effort has gone into building
consensus for Madrid]{.underline}**, in many ways **[the [hard work
starts now.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[There is]{.mark} [a coherence
issue]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The Strategic]{.underline}**
**[Concept]{.underline}**, as NATO's strategy, comes after the two main
plans -- SACEUR's Concept for the Deterrence and Defence of the
Euro-Atlantic Area and the future NATO Warfighting Capstone Concept --
have already matured. There was tacit acknowledgement at the Madrid
summit that many underlying operational plans would have to be revised.
However, with NATO's strategy transforming, mere tweaks to plans do not
seem sufficient, and their core assumptions should be revisited. **[[For
NATO]{.mark}'s Warfighting Capstone Concept]{.underline}** -- **[how it
fights in the future]{.underline}** -- **[[it is imperative]{.mark}
that]{.underline}** analysis of **[[Russia's military performance in
Ukraine]{.mark} now [becomes the backbone for]{.mark} its
[development]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[despite the collective
might of [NATO,]{.mark}]{.underline}** it **[[cannot do
everything]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and the commitment at the 2015 Warsaw
summit to a '360-degree approach' to security -- both thematically
[**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} geographically -- **[[risks
overstretch]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In a hardening world, the Alliance
must take the opportunity to go back to its roots and seek support from
other actors, such as the EU. It is still expected that a NATO--EU joint
declaration will materialise before the end of the year. NATO's Russia
Problem **[The new]{.underline}** Strategic **[Concept identifies and
defines the Russian threat for the remainder of the
decade]{.underline}**. **[But threat identification is only half of the
job]{.underline}**, **[and '[threat mitigation'
]{.mark}]{.underline}**-- or the actual activity -- **[[is]{.mark} the
[priority]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In this regard, the document lacks the
vision and a realistic timeframe for understanding the parameters of the
NATO--Russia confrontation. This is not just a NATO issue, but its
self-declared 'unique, essential and indispensable' role in European
security is important in influencing and managing Russian behaviour.
**[The Strategic Concept states that 'Strategic stability, delivered
through effective deterrence and defence, arms control and disarmament,
and meaningful and reciprocal political dialogue remains essential to
our security']{.underline}**. To achieve this, it is first critical to
understand which key tenets of European security, or parts thereof, are
still in play; what can be built on; and what must be discarded. This
applies to the Washington Treaty 1949; the Helsinki Final Act 1975; the
Charter of Paris for a New Europe 1990; the NATO-Russia Founding Act
1997; the OSCE Istanbul Document 1999; and the Vienna Document 2011.
Moreover, the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe 1990, the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty 1987, the Treaty on Open Skies
1992, and the Chemical Weapons Convention 1993 all appear moribund,
albeit for different reasons. It is important that future engagement
with Russia is designed in a way that incentivises cooperation and
builds a structure for dialogue that reflects the future strategic
environment, rather than the context of the Cold War. The fundamental
problem is a lack of trust on both sides, and therefore a low likelihood
of compliance if an agreement could be achieved. Collective security is
not necessarily dead, but it might have to take a back seat for a while
as we return to balance-of-power politics for the foreseeable future.
NATO members need to be prepared for the consequences. In for the Long
Haul **[Despite Ukraine not]{.underline}** being **[a]{.underline}**
**[member of the Alliance]{.underline}**, **[[the outcome]{.mark} of the
war [is critical to NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**, European security, and
the principle that aggressors cannot redraw international borders by
force. **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[has]{.underline}** now
**[stated]{.underline}** that '**[A strong, independent Ukraine is vital
for the stability of the Euro-Atlantic area', and it [must follow
through with action]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[However, the]{.mark}
announced [enhancements to NATO's defence and deterrence]{.mark}
posture]{.underline}** **[[will come at an eyewatering cost to
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** common funding, **[[which]{.mark} will
[fall]{.mark} [on]{.mark} national [defence ministry
budgets]{.mark}]{.underline}** that are **[[already under
strain]{.mark}]{.underline}** when it comes to delivering extant
equipment budgets. Moreover, with economies hit by the coronavirus
pandemic, the cost of living, and inflationary pressure, **[the [ability
to sustain political will]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[on NATO funding
[will diminish]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Critical to this will be the
ability of governments to communicate the Russian threat to their
populations clearly and transparently. They need to effectively bring to
life national security risk assessments to make the case for sustained
higher spending, and 'Putin equals bad' messaging is insufficient. This
struggle goes beyond Putin, and we need to ensure we don't make the
mistake of assuming that what comes next is automatically better.
**[Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea was a wakeup call]{.underline}**
that the Alliance didn't fully grasp. Some modest transformation did
occur, such as the creation of the NRF and Enhanced Forward Presence, as
well as the recommitment to spending 2% of GDP on defence by 2024 at the
2014 Wales summit. **[However, the political rhetoric was not backed by
commitment, which weakened NATO deterrence]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** might have **[inadvertently influenced Putin's
decision-making calculus towards Ukraine]{.underline}**. **[[If NATO
fails]{.mark} to translate words into action now, [it could be fatal for
the Alliance]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[NATO's main task]{.mark} in the foreseeable security environment is
to adapt to [the threat posed by Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}** while
also trying to reach a precise understanding of the challenge posed by
China. At the planned Madrid Summit in June 2022, **[NATO will adopt [a
new Strategic Concept]{.mark} to [guide the
alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}**['s]{.mark} future political and military
development, which is the right starting point for a new strategy to
manage renewed great power competition. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has
prompted NATO to eliminate any doubts about its ability and resolve to
defend its eastern territory against a Russian attack. **[[NATO]{.mark}
is at arguably the most important juncture in its post-Cold War
history]{.underline}**. NATO **[[must adapt]{.mark} not only its
military preparedness but also [its approach to]{.mark} the
[nonmilitary]{.mark}---[and]{.mark} specifically
illiberal---[challenges]{.mark} that Russia and China pose [to its
resilience and cohesion]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To advance their
geopolitical interests, **[[Russia and China
exploited]{.underline}]{.mark}** the openness of society in **[[NATO
allies and]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[the]{.underline}** **[[divisions
between them]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[over the past
decade]{.underline}**. **[[NATO must]{.underline}]{.mark}** always
**[[be wary of]{.mark} external [challenges that could undermine]{.mark}
its [unity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This was true during the Cold War in
the face of an ideological rival seeking to undermine confidence in
Western democratic governments, and it remains true in the face of
Russia and China today. Conversely, **[NATO needs to navigate its
adaptation to its illiberal challenge while avoiding functional
over-extension]{.underline}**. **[[The alliance is at risk of
maladaptation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[whereby it extends its own
activities unnecessarily into civilian areas of security]{.mark} in
which it lacks necessary expertise and legacy]{.underline}**. Strong
voices in the expert community call for NATO to specify resilience as a
core task in the forthcoming Strategic Concept, in principle elevating
it to a task of equal importance to collective defense. An influential
report commissioned by Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg to inspire the
Strategic Concept recommends that NATO reinvent itself as a "liberal
bulwark" against Russia and China and extend the alliance's
responsibilities into the realm of democratic resilience. **[NATO [must
steer clear of]{.mark} the [temptation to take on too many tasks]{.mark}
[and]{.mark}]{.underline}** instead **[[enhance resilience only in
areas]{.mark} that can be [reconciled with its mandate]{.mark} as a
security and defense alliance]{.underline}**. **[The encounter with
illiberal powers strengthens NATO's unity, but that does not necessarily
mean that NATO is the right institution to meet the illiberal challenges
that Russia and China pose]{.underline}**. So far, **[[the
alliance's]{.mark} record of responding to these threats has been
uneven]{.underline}**, and the **[[perspectives about its role have
diverged]{.underline}]{.mark}** at times [**[between]{.underline}** the
**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited [**[S]{.underline}**]{.mark}tates
[**[and its European partners]{.underline}**]{.mark}. But there is a way
forward, **[if NATO can clearly delineate what should and should not
fall within its remit, be clear-eyed about its strategic
environment]{.underline}**, and prioritize international partners that
share NATO's interests and values. Containing Russia, Watching China
NATO's adaptation to Russia's revisionist foreign policy has so far
focused mostly on the military threat that the country poses. In
response to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, NATO enhanced its
capacity for rapid reaction and placed multinational battlegroups in
Poland and each of the Baltic states as a "tripwire" to remind Russia of
NATO's collective defense guarantee. In response to Russia's full-scale
invasion of Ukraine in 2022, NATO will likely aim to demonstrate its
ability and resolve to repel an attack by Russia's forces stationed near
allied territory by improving its reinforcement capability to deter
major Russian military buildups like the one around Ukraine. NATO
already boosted its existing forward deployments, while the rise in
European defense expenditure will enable the alliance to shoulder a
broader deterrence effort. Conversely, NATO has not fully found its
foothold when it comes to Russia's political warfare, by which it has
attempted to diminish the alliance's ability to act cohesively. The
digital age has enhanced the opportunities for Russia to engage in
information and psychological warfare, including hack-and-leak
operations to influence and discredit elections. The polarization of the
political landscapes on both sides of the Atlantic over the past decade
has made countries more receptive to Russian disinformation and
narratives seeking to discredit the democratic process. Moreover,
Russian assassination and sabotage operations on NATO territory have
contributed to a public sense of vulnerability to heavy-handed
authoritarian methods and doubt about the coping power of democratic
institutions. China does not compare to the direct threat that Russia
poses but has nevertheless appeared on NATO's strategic radar as an
economic great power with a high-tech edge that Russia is unlikely to
ever match. Chinese 5G network provider Huawei remains a pertinent topic
for NATO, as several European countries, including Germany, Austria,
Spain, the Netherlands and Hungary, are still undecided about relying on
its potentially compromised technology or de facto allowing their
national operators to use Chinese providers. Moreover, Chinese
investments in continental Europe without conditionalities attached and
targeting critical infrastructure (railway stations, ports and airports)
raise suspicions about Beijing's underlying political and military
motives. Moreover, China is pressing ahead with military applications of
artificial intelligence (AI), and its space ambitions are growing. Since
2014, NATO has become increasingly aware of the nonmilitary challenges
to its unity and resilience but has adapted only in certain respects. It
adopted the so-called baseline requirements in 2016, against which it
can measure individual allies' level of resilience regarding their
provision of essential services to their domestic populations. These
basics that would be necessary to withstand a crisis include access to
food, water and energy supplies; maintenance of core functions of
government; and resilient civil transportation systems. However, the
baseline requirements are technical measurements that do not adequately
grasp the political nature of the challenges that Russia and China pose
to alliance unity. Moreover, their focus on civil preparedness, resource
management and infrastructure does not seem to fit squarely within the
competencies of a defense alliance. NATO may be on a slippery slope with
the scope of its resilience concept drifting further away from its
defense capabilities. **[NATO,]{.underline}** as an organization and as
an alliance of states, **[is aware of the challenges to transatlantic
resilience and cohesion that Russia and China pose, but the alliance
[has not been able to agree on the issues]{.mark} to [which]{.mark} it
can [bring]{.mark} added [value]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} The
situation today stands **[in contrast to]{.underline}** the situation
during **[the Cold War when NATO successfully calibrated resilience to
the ability to resist an armed attack]{.underline}** by focusing on
civil emergency planning. Russia and China are illiberal challengers
that add new meaning to transatlantic security cooperation, but
**[[NATO's adaptation will depend on]{.mark} the [extent]{.mark} to
which the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[and Europe can find
agreement]{.mark} on investment in transatlantic
security]{.underline}**.

#### C \-\-- Failing to contain Ukraine conflict escalates to wider Euro war, prolif, collapses U.S. cred and alliances in Asia and causes China adventurism

<https://www.cfr.org/report/preventing-wider-european-conflict#:~:text=The%20Russian%20military%20intervention%20in,and%20further%20west%20into%20Europe>)

**[The Russian military intervention]{.underline}** in Ukraine **[could
easily escalate into a larger conflict stretching from the Baltic to the
Black Sea and further west into Europe]{.underline}**. Although Russia,
wielding massive military superiority, might overrun Ukrainian forces in
a matter of weeks, stabilizing and pacifying the country will likely
prove to be a grueling and costly affair. A significant Ukrainian
resistance movement is almost certain to emerge. With sustained Western
support, it could prolong the warfare for months, if not years. The
first wave of sanctions that Washington has levied on Moscow could be
followed by others in a continuing effort to raise the cost to Moscow
and force it to yield. A negotiated end to the conflict will not come
easily, since Washington has framed it in Manichean terms as a world
historical struggle between the democratic West and the aggressive,
malevolent, and autocratic Russia. Anything short of "victory" will be
decried as surrender or appeasement in the West, while Russia will not
capitulate on a matter it considers vital to its security and
prosperity. The stage is thus set for an escalating cycle of violence,
with Moscow seeking to stamp out a Ukrainian insurgency and retaliate
against Western efforts to stop Russia's advance. **[If the conflict
wears on, Moscow could be increasingly tempted to expand its military
operations further into Europe to achieve its goals.]{.underline}** As a
first option, **[Russia could intensify pressure on states neighboring
Ukraine]{.underline}** (e.g., Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia)
that could provide safe havens for insurgents or the inevitable
government-in-exile. It will doubtless reinforce its military presence
in Kaliningrad and elsewhere in the Baltics and patrol the Baltic Sea
more aggressively. It could deploy hybrid-war tactics---cyberattacks,
disinformation campaigns, and economic sabotage---to destabilize
countries providing safe havens. If those actions did not sufficiently
degrade the resistance, Moscow could even launch direct attacks on
insurgents and their supporters outside Ukraine, as well as attempt to
assassinate leading figures in the government-in-exile, akin to the
attacks it has made on Chechen rebels and Federal Security Service (FSB)
defectors in Europe in recent years. Such steps could, at a minimum,
draw frontline NATO states directly into the military conflict with
Russia, obligating the United States and other allies to come to their
defense. To build up further pressure, Moscow could also "weaponize" the
inevitable refugee flows into neighboring states. Refugees, who would
likely number in the millions, would move first into unoccupied
Ukrainian territory but eventually into adjacent European states, which
have shown little tolerance for outsiders. Moscow could use harsh
military and police tactics that would increase the number of refugees
and seek to guide them into countries where they would create the
greatest socioeconomic stress, such as Moldova. In addition, Moscow
could increase the tension by pushing Belarusian President Aleksandr
Lukashenko to again seek to push thousands of Middle Eastern migrants
across the borders into Poland and Lithuania. That could lead to border
clashes, as it almost did on occasion last fall, with Russia supporting
its ally, Belarus, and NATO states coming to the defense of allies under
attack. A second option Moscow could pursue is opening up a second front
in the Balkans. In recent years, Russia has taken a number of
destabilizing actions in the region, seeking to weaken Montenegro after
its accession to NATO, exacerbate tensions between Serbs and Bosniaks in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and undermine relations between Serbia and Kosovo.
As it fought in Ukraine, Russia could encourage Republika Srpska leader
Milorad Dodik to press for separation from Bosnia, threatening to
reignite the bitter wars of the 1990s in the former Yugoslavia. A
Balkans war would complicate the security calculus of all countries in
the region, as well as that of Germany and France, which have
significant interests there. To quell the fighting, NATO countries could
decide to use military force against Bosnian Serb forces enjoying
Russian support. A third, riskier, option would be to directly attack
the United States, the country that Moscow believes is orchestrating a
larger anti-Russia campaign. In response to Western sanctions designed
to crater Russia's financial system and undermine critical industries,
Moscow could launch major cyberattacks against U.S. critical
infrastructure. If a cyberattack were to take down a major financial
institution or corrupt its records, the ensuing havoc in U.S. markets
could prompt overwhelming public and congressional pressure for a
forceful response. The U.S. and NATO response to Russian actions will
impact Moscow's decisions on the conduct of the conflict. Both a weak
response and an excessively harsh one could lead to escalation. In the
first case, Moscow could be tempted to press militarily even further
into Europe to enlarge its sphere of influence. Vladimir Putin has
demanded that NATO withdraw its forces back to the lines they held in
1997, when the NATO-Russia Founding Act was signed and the first wave of
post−Cold War expansion remained in the future. His remarks announcing
the start of hostilities against Ukraine hinted at a broader effort to
restore Russia's control over all of the former Soviet Union. That could
include military action against the Baltic states, especially Lithuania,
through which Moscow could try to carve out a land corridor to
Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea. NATO would have little
choice but to provide military aid to those states if it did not want to
forfeit its role as the central pillar of European security. Crippling
sanctions, meanwhile, could provoke Putin to lash out with greater
violence. If Putin felt cornered, he could escalate the conflict either
horizontally to other countries or vertically to the nuclear level in a
desperate effort to save himself, his regime, and, in his mind, Russia
itself. And he could find considerable public support for such a
reaction. Already, some Russians believe that U.S. and EU sanctions are
aimed not simply at the leaders behind the war but, by cratering the
economy, at all Russians. Warning Indicators As is the case with the
current crisis in Ukraine, Moscow's intentions will remain ambiguous.
The indicators of an approaching escalation in the conflict beyond
Ukraine are likely to fall into three categories. The first indicators
that political and military conditions are increasing the risk of
broader conflict include a breakdown in channels of communication with
Moscow. The absence of active diplomatic ties would preclude a
negotiated resolution of the conflict in Ukraine. An end to U.S.-Russian
military-to-military channels would undermine any effort to avoid direct
military conflict between the two countries. Another indicator would be
major insurgent successes that dramatically increase Russian casualties.
Moscow would be tempted to move more aggressively against insurgent safe
havens rather than capitulate on what it considers to be its vital
interest in Ukraine. Second are the indicators that Moscow is preparing
for a broader conflict, which it would undoubtedly argue had been forced
by Western actions. Such signs include Kremlin efforts to prepare the
Russian public for a wider conflict, which could entail official
statements, greater media focus on escalating Western "aggression," an
increased pace of civil defense drills, and mobilization of reserves.
Another indicator includes the massing of Russian forces in the Baltic
region. It could include such moves as aggressive hybrid actions to
destabilize Poland and the Baltic states, coupled with efforts to rally
indigenous ethnic Russian communities against their governments. Third
are the indicators that Moscow is intentionally seeking to widen the
conflict. This could include greater support for Bosnian Serb leader
Dodik, such as diplomatic and financial backing, and provision of
weapons. They could also encourage Serb leaders to more assertively
pursue their grievances against Kosovo. Implications for the United
States **[A wider European conflict would pose the stiffest challenge to
the global standing of the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[since the end of the Cold War and to the
international system it has built and underwritten for decades
longer]{.underline}**. **[It would test the durability of its global
system of alliances and the efficacy of international regimes and
institutions that have guarded world peace, security, and
prosperity.]{.underline}** The challenge would come at a time when the
United States itself is in immense disarray, as a deeply polarized
polity confronts massive domestic problems---the pandemic, inflation,
racial justice, and cultural wars---that leave less time and fewer
resources for foreign matters. The United States will be tested to see
whether it can muster the will, energy, and creativity to execute an
effective policy toward the unfolding crisis in Europe. At home, public
attention has been focused on developments in and around Ukraine, but
the Joe Biden administration cannot ignore the home front. In response
to U.S.-levied sanctions, Russia can be expected to step up its cyber
operations against the United States. It will more actively sow
disinformation, seek to exacerbate domestic tensions, and paralyze
critical infrastructure. The severity of the attacks will likely rise in
proportion to the harshness of the sanctions Washington levies on
Moscow. Abroad, the fate of the transatlantic community, a central
pillar of U.S. security and prosperity, would be a stake. One of the
Biden administration's priorities, as laid out in the Interim National
Security Strategy Guidance released in March 2021, is repairing U.S.
alliances---especially with Europe---after four disruptive years under
President Donald Trump. Although relations are more cordial, significant
substantive differences remain and the willingness of allies to align
behind a common purpose for the long haul remains questionable.
**[The]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates'
**[allies have rallied behind a harsh set of sanctions in
response]{.underline}** to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, **[but
preserving unity as the conflict drags on remains a
challenge]{.underline}**, especially if sacrifice is spread unevenly
across NATO, as will most likely be the case. **[Putin will seek to
exploit divisions through]{.underline}** differentiated levels of
pressure on NATO members, **[targeted energy cutoffs, offers of
negotiation]{.underline}**, and the like to advance two long-standing
Russian goals: the end of NATO as a collective defense organization and
the erosion of the foundations of the EU. Should he succeed, the new
order that would emerge in Europe is far from certain. But Russia would
undoubtedly play a central role in its formulation, and almost any
conceivable new order would diminish the power and role of the United
States on the continent. A similar situation obtains in the Indo-Pacific
region. The Biden administration spent 2021 bolstering relations with
its allies and partners---energizing the Quad (the United States,
Australia, India, and Japan), and cutting a submarine deal with the
United Kingdom and Australia---to meet the growing strategic challenge
posed by China. **[A major, prolonged European distraction could undo
further efforts to pivot to Asia, raise doubts among allies and partners
about the credibility of the U.S. commitment, and free China to pursue
its objectives with greater vigor.]{.underline}** The United States
could avoid this outcome by pursuing lesser goals in Europe---leading to
the quicker development of a new order less favorable to American
interests---or by a massive buildup of its military capabilities that
would enable it to play a major, perhaps decisive, role in both regions.
The latter would have to come at the cost of the Biden administration's
domestic priorities. Whether the Biden administration could muster
sufficient domestic political support, if it decided to move in this
direction, is far from certain. In addition to regional challenges, a
major European conflict would also stress critical international regimes
and institutions. One of the first victims would likely be the arms
control regime that has served as the foundation of strategic nuclear
stability for the past fifty-plus years. The United States withdrew from
some central elements---including the Anti-Ballistic Missiles (ABM) and
the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaties---but two critical
elements have remained in place: the New START treaty and the
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). A wider conflict in Europe would all but
guarantee that the United States and Russia could not agree to a
follow-on treaty to the New START treaty before it expires in 2026, and
the NPT review conference tentatively scheduled for August 2022 would
fall by the wayside. As a consequence, the incipient arms race now
underway, fueled by new technologies---hypersonics, cyber tools, and
artificial intelligence---would accelerate. **[A new wave of nuclear
proliferation could ensue, especially if U.S. allies and partners lose
faith in America's commitment to extended deterrence.]{.underline}**
**[Mutually assured destruction, which]{.underline}** for better or
worse **[has anchored strategic stability since the early]{.underline}**
19**[70s]{.underline}**, **[would be severely stressed in a multipolar
nuclear landscape with Russia and the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[fighting at least a
proxy war]{.underline}**.

Escalation of War (15)

Increasing, enlarging, or intensifying the nature, magnitude, or
parameters of a war. Escalation may entail an increase in troops,
additional third party involvement, the use of deadlier weapons, or a
change in political or military objectives. Escalation may be likened to
a ladder, in that the level of coercion and force tends to increase as
the war becomes more costly and uncertain. In a limited war, states can
employ sundry military measures to challenge one another's resolve and
capabilities. in such conflicts, the goal of escalation may be to defeat
or force the surrender of an adversary, or to mete out increased
punishment to pressure a foe to negotiate or terminate the action that
originally precipitated the conflict. **[In a limited war, military
objectives]{.underline}** tend to **[escalate rapidly. In a nuclear
confrontation]{.underline}**, however, the stakes are far
greater---**[rapid escalation]{.underline}** must be avoided, as it
**[could spell instant]{.underline}** disaster or
**[extinction]{.underline}**. In a nuclear age, most experts believe
there is no such thing as a "limited" nuclear war. For example**[, if
one side initiated a war in Europe, even with conventional weapons, it
is highly likely that it would escalate inevitably to a
global]{.underline} strategic [nuclear war, since neither side would be
willing to accept defeat in such a critical arena]{.underline}**. See

internally" represent a serious threat to multilateralism, on which the
Alliance has depended. Oftentimes, national leaders "use NATO as a

**[A]{.underline}** **[united NATO]{.underline}** **[is critically

domestic]{.underline}** **[trust]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[confidence]{.underline}** **[in the Alliance among its member
states]{.underline}**, including Canada, **[represents a]{.underline}**
**[threat to this cohesion]{.underline}**. A proposal to withdraw Canada
from NATO was tabled at a recent policy conference for one of Canada's
three major political parties. The proposal was defeated, but it
represents a fringe anti-NATO narrative within Canada's illiberal left;
if left unaddressed, such a narrative could grow.

**[If countries like Russia perceive NATO as an]{.underline}**
**[atomized collection of states]{.underline}** **[with]{.underline}**

believe they can]{.underline}** **[cross a red line]{.underline}**
**[and only face]{.underline}** a **[limited response]{.underline}**.
Thus, **[gaps in cohesion]{.underline}** **[within the

#### Prolif causes nuclear conflict

**[A new nuclear-arms race]{.underline}**, moreover, **[could be even
riskier]{.underline}** than the one Reagan and others worked so hard to
end. In retrospect, **[the Cold War standoff between two massive,
nuclear-armed superpowers offered some stability]{.underline}**; among
other things, **[the fact that the United States and the Soviet Union
could destroy each other, or any other challenger, in a nuclear
confrontation ended up preventing either side from using nuclear
weapons. Global alliances were structured in a bipolar
system]{.underline}**, with smaller powers picking one side or the
other, **[which meant fewer possible avenues for
conflict]{.underline}**. But that world came to an end when the Cold War
finished. **[We now live in a multipolar world that is]{.underline}**,
in many ways, **[a more dangerous one]{.underline}**. Former Secretaries
of State Kissinger and George Shultz, former Secretary of Defense
William Perry, and Senator Sam Nunn warned in 2011 that "**[the growing
number of nations with nuclear arms and differing motives, aims and
ambitions poses very high and unpredictable risks and increased
instability." One particularly risky and region right now is East Asia,
where competing territorial claims and an unpredictable North Korea
threaten to flare into conflict. If Japan, which is revising its
pacifist]{.underline}** post-World War II **[foreign policy toward a
more assertive one, or South Korea, where there is broad popular support
for weaponization, go nuclear, the chances grow for a regional arms
race---and for nuclear war]{.underline}**. One possibility, as Mark
Fitzpatrick of the International Institute for Strategic Studies noted:
"**[North Korea might be tempted to launch a preemptive attack at a time
when the U.S. defense commitment \[to South Korea\] might no longer
apply]{.underline}**." But even "short of this worst-case scenario,
rather than negotiate disarmament, North Korea more likely would claim
the South's actions as a justification for stepping up its own nuclear
program." **[These are by no means the only risks. There
is]{.underline}**, for example, **[the risk of an accidental firing or a
rogue officer deciding that he or she wants to launch a nuclear weapon.
There is the risk of "loose nukes" falling into the wrong hands, and the
risk that individual scientists will be willing to transfer nuclear
technology to the highest bidder]{.underline}**, as Pakistan's A.Q. Khan
did in selling nuclear technology to Iran, Libya, and North Korea. When
the nuclear bomb was first being developed, Secretary of War Henry
Stimson offered a poignant warning about how devastating the weapon
would be. He told President Henry Truman that "**[such a weapon may be
constructed in secret and used suddenly and effectively with devastating
power by a willful nation or group against an unsuspecting nation or
group of much greater size and material power]{.underline}**." Today,
**[America's "greater size and material power" can't necessarily stop a
nuclear strike, particularly if the materials fall into the hands of
terrorists.]{.underline}**

//um-ef)

Now that **[the summit is over]{.underline}** and the dust has begun to
settle, it's possible to say that, by and large, the summit delivered.
President Biden and the other NATO leaders came together to take many,
though not all, of the steps necessary to stand up to Russian President
Vladimir Putin. The transatlantic community, including the United
States, will be stronger and more secure as a result. **[There was
remarkable unity]{.underline}**, capped by Turkey dropping its de facto
veto of Finnish and Swedish NATO accession with the surprise signing of
the trilateral memorandum that led to an invitation to the two
Scandinavian countries to join the alliance. In the leadup to the
summit, despite feverish efforts by the NATO Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg and others, it seemed likely that Turkish President
Erdogan's objections to Finnish and Swedish membership would cast a pall
over the gathering, and hand the Russian's a huge propaganda victory.
That, however, was not to be. Thanks to some likely carrots offered by
the U.S. to Turkey, Finland and Sweden are now poised to become the 31st
and 32nd NATO members. While far from official, the likelihood of
Finnish and Swedish accession to NATO is a cause for celebration
especially since their joining the alliance had only been a remote
possibility just a few months ago. At the summit, **[NATO also adopted a
new Strategic Concept]{.underline}**, a document that details the
alliance's key purpose and tasks going forward and its first mission
update in 12 years. The document reflects the new geostrategic reality
facing the alliance, stating: The Russian Federation has violated the
norms and principles that contributed to a stable and predictable
European security order. We cannot discount the possibility of an attack
against Allies' sovereignty and territorial integrity. Strategic
competition, pervasive instability and recurrent shocks define our
broader security environment. This **[differs substantially from the
treatment of Russia in]{.underline}** the **[2010]{.underline}**
Strategic Concept, when NATO still saw the possibility for "a true
strategic partnership between NATO and Russia." **[The new Strategic
Concept,]{.underline}** along **[with the summit
declaration]{.underline}** and the statements of the allied leaders,
also **[stress collective defense]{.underline}**. Specifically, they all
reiterate, nearly verbatim, the message of the Strategic Concept, aimed
squarely at Moscow: "While NATO is a defensive Alliance, no one should
doubt our strength and resolve to defend every inch of Allied territory,
preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all Allies and
prevail against any aggressor." **[The alliance also took actions to
back up its words, announcing the expansion of the NATO Response Force
from its current 40,000 military personnel to 300,000,]{.underline}**
**[as well as continued growth in prepositioned weapons and equipment
stockpiles]{.underline}**. The NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg
noted of the Response Force expansion, "For the first time since the
Cold War, we will have pre-assigned forces to defend specific Allies so
that we can reinforce much faster if needed." In fact, some allies have
already stepped up, with Germany pledging 15,000 soldiers and the U.K.
offering a Carrier Strike Group. In response to Russia's first invasion
of Ukraine in 2014, **[NATO created an Enhanced Forward
Presence]{.underline}** (EFP) **[of four multinational battalions in
each of the Baltic states and Poland]{.underline}**. These large
deployments of forces at the edge of NATO's eastern flank are
**[intended to deter any attacks against the alliance's most vulnerable
members.]{.underline}** This March in Brussels, following Russia's
full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the alliance announced the creation of
four additional EFP battalions, one each stationed in Bulgaria, Hungary,
Romania and Slovakia. **[The four new multinational battlegroups are
already up and running]{.underline}**. Moreover, NATO recently announced
each EFP battlegroup would be increased to a brigade-level force; a
doubling of their size to between 3,000-5,000 soldiers apiece. Some
countries have already announced increases to their Enhanced Forward
Presence contributions. For instance, the United Kingdom has roughly
doubled its deployment to the EFP battlegroup in Estonia to over 1,600
troops. In early June, Germany announced that a further 500 troops would
be stationed in Lithuania, as part of the German-led EFP battalion,
increasing its footprint there to 1500 troops, up from 500 before the
war began. The battlegroups have alliance-wide participation. Today,
putting aside the three Baltic states that host EFP battalions to
bolster their own forces, Greece, Portugal and Turkey are the only NATO
members that do not contribute to an EFP battalion. What's more,
Portugal frequently contributes forces, including recently temporarily
deploying troops to the NATO battlegroups in both Lithuania and Romania.
On top of this and in conjunction with the summit, **[the U.S. announced
a raft of new European deployments]{.underline}**. These include two
F-35 squadrons to be based in the U.K.; the establishment in Poland of
the permanent V Corps headquarters (to provide command and control
"focused on synchronizing U.S. Army, allied, and partner nation tactical
formations operating in Europe"); a new rotational brigade combat team
deploying to Romania; enhanced rotational deployments to the Baltics,
which will include "armored, aviation, air defense, and special
operations forces"; the forward stationing of an "an air defense
artillery brigade headquarters, a short-range air defense battalion, a
combat sustainment support battalion headquarters, and an engineer
brigade headquarters" in Germany, as well as a short-range air defense
battery in Italy. Meanwhile, **[NATO countries continue to make greater
defense investments]{.underline}**. In 2022, for instance, Slovakia will
join the list of countries that spend the 2% of GDP or more on defense
(there are 9 total) required of NATO members. And many more member
states have pledged to reach the 2% threshold in the coming years. With
this additional spending, allies are not merely padding military
pensions, they're investing in real capabilities. Indeed, all but six
member states now meet the second NATO benchmark to invest 20% or more
of defense expenditures in major new capabilities, 17 more than did in
2014. In Madrid, NATO also took off its rose-colored glasses regarding
China, declaring in the new Strategic Concept that "The People's
Republic of China's stated ambitions and coercive policies challenge our
interests, security and values," and warning, "The deepening strategic
partnership between the People's Republic of China and the Russian
Federation and their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut the
rules-based international order run counter to our values and
interests." In the 2010 iteration, China was not even mentioned. It is
perhaps then no surprise that the leaders of allies in the Pacific
theater, Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea
participated for the first time in a NATO summit. The need to counter
Russia with a united front including the engagement of allies in Asia,
coupled with the rising challenge of China (now firmly on NATO's radar)
means it's likely we will see similar participation of Asian allies in
future alliance summits, probably beginning at the next meeting in 2023
in Lithuania. Much Left To Be Done **[Even though the]{.underline}**
Madrid **[summit should]{.underline}** largely **[be billed as a
success, how much of a success remains to be seen]{.underline}**.
**[Much depends on implementing the decisions]{.underline}** just taken.
For instance, **[will the alliance reach its goal of finding 240,000 new
troops for its response force?]{.underline}** And **[will it continue
its progress on increasing allied defense spending?]{.underline}**
Despite significant improvements, fewer than one-third of member states
are currently spending 2% of their GDP on defense. Even Finnish and
Swedish accession could still be a sticky wicket. For instance, the
language of the memorandum inviting the two countries to apply for
membership was vague enough to allow them to join the alliance without
having many actual responsibilities. This possibility is on Turkey's
mind because the ink on the agreement was barely dry before Erdogan
created new caveats for the two countries, saying: "The key thing is for
promises to come true," and "we will monitor the enforcement of the
elements in the memorandum and will take our steps accordingly."
Turkey's about-face on Swedish and Finnish membership was suspiciously
timed to the announcement of Biden administration support not only for
the sale of F-16 upgrade kits to Turkey (which they had previously
endorsed), but also the sale of new F-16 fighter jets. At the same time,
while President Biden may be confident of congressional approval for the
sales, it is far from assured. And **[on support for Ukraine, which not
surprisingly was a focus of the summit, the proof will be in the
pudding.]{.underline}** Russia's war in Ukraine shows no sign of
abating, and **[the ability and willingness of the West to continue its
essential support for Ukraine long term is not
guaranteed]{.underline}**. **[Domestic economic
pressures]{.underline}**, **[coupled with increasingly drawn down
munitions and weapons stocks]{.underline}** (as well as atrophied
defense industrial bases that are necessary to backfill them), **[will
combine to test the long-term resolve of NATO members to stand shoulder
to should with Ukraine as Russia's war there rages on]{.underline}**.
Finally, while the standing up of the four new NATO battlegroups with
nearly alliance-wide participation is a big positive, the forces remain
a tripwire rather than the core of an adequate defense. So far, NATO has
failed to move beyond a tripwire concept in Eastern Europe and toward a
force posture of deterrence with broad and, more importantly, robust
participation across the alliance. In failing to do so, NATO members
missed a historic opportunity and may have left room for dangerous
ambiguity as to the alliance's resolve. In Madrid, **[NATO successfully
continued to]{.underline}** flesh out promises made at its Brussels
gathering this past spring, **[strengthen]{.underline}**ing
**[deterrence in Eastern Europe]{.underline}**---and in turn, **[making
a spillover conflict from the Russian war against Ukraine less
likely]{.underline}**, an outcome squarely in U.S. national interest.
**[Now it remains for the U.S. and its allies to fulfill the decisions
made]{.underline}** in Madrid and close down avenues of ambiguity
regarding NATO resolve to stand up to aggressors and defend every inch
of its territory.

Resetting NATO: The Sword and the Shield Redux "**[What we are looking

planning]{.underline}** **[for [how it will contain
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}** post Ukraine **[[and provide resilience
and reassurance]{.underline}]{.mark}** to countries that cannot do that
on their own. That could be permanent basing or it could be rapid
readiness---being able to deploy quickly, instead of being stuck in a
big base in one place. **[That is all up for development]{.underline}**,
which I think is incredibly important." -- Ben Wallace MP, UK Defence
Secretary, May 19, 202268 **[[NATO's defense and deterrence reset will
begin in Madrid]{.underline}]{.mark}** when its leaders open the next
chapter of their alliance **[with its eighth strategic
concept]{.underline}**. Like its predecessors, the concept will set the
vision and basic principles that will guide NATO through this testing
time.69 **[[But the devil will be in the detail]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
As Britain's defense secretary Ben Wallace stated recently, **[the finer
points of NATO's new strategy]{.underline}**, such as whether it will
rely on deterrence by reinforcement or through permanently forward-based
forces, **[[will require development by NATO's]{.mark} military planners
[in the weeks and months after Madrid]{.mark}]{.underline}**. What can
they learn from the history of NATO's strategic concepts? Plan against
Russian "Maximum Intentions" The guidance that accompanied NATO's first
strategic concept advised that for defense planning purposes: "Precise
Soviet intentions are not known and cannot be predicted with reliable
accuracy. For military planning purposes, however, it is essential to
consider maximum intentions and capabilities."70 This is sound advice
considering the inherent uncertainty in estimating adversary intentions
and plans.71 It is also best practice for military planning.72 Moreover,
in light of Russia's current actions, NATO's 1956 assessment of Soviet
intentions and their implications are strikingly resonant today. Beyond
the following highlights, the assessment is worth reading in full:73
Circumstances may develop, however, in which the Soviet leaders may
harden their attitude and be prepared to take greater risks than
theretofore. They have indulged in the use of threats, including the
threat of war and even of nuclear attack, as blackmail to attain their
ends. The Soviets are thus not likely to launch such \[conventional\]
attacks, provided that the West maintains its defence commitments, such
as the stationing of overseas troops in Western Europe, its firm purpose
to defend itself, appropriate nuclear retaliatory strength and adequate
conventional forces to ensure that local armed intervention by Soviet or
satellite forces does not offer a prospect of easy success. However, the
following possibilities of action . . . must be included among those
requiring consideration: (a) General attacks against NATO. The USSR
might launch general attacks with conventional weapons against NATO if
the Soviet leaders estimated that the Alliance would be deterred from
employing nuclear weapons . . . for example: - because of assumed
Western reluctance to be the first to use nuclear weapons. - because
\[the West feared\] it was more vulnerable than the Soviet Union to
nuclear attack. - because of assumed Western division or demoralisation.
(b) Local attacks against NATO. If the Soviets believe that NATO . . .
were not able to defend itself against all types of limited aggression .
. . \[they\] might initiate, instigate, support or condone such
aggression. (c) Attacks against peripheral non-NATO countries. If . . .
the Soviet leaders thought that a non-NATO country on the periphery of
the Soviet Bloc would not or could not receive effective support of the
Western powers, the Soviets might be tempted to use their preponderance
in conventional forces either for armed intervention in the country in
question or to exert pressure on it in order to influence it towards
alignment with the Soviet camp.74 Revitalize the Sword and the Shield
The second insight logically follows the first. The assessment of Soviet
intentions set out above led to NATO adopting its strategy of the sword
and the shield in its 1957 strategic concept---a combination of
strategic nuclear forces to deter attack through the threat of massive
retaliation, alongside the forward defense of NATO's eastern front
through the basing of significant forces as far east as possible.75 If
NATO's assessment of Russia today is anywhere close to that made by
NATO's planners of the Soviet Union then, the option of revitalizing
this strategy must be on the table. Several questions for NATO defense
planners flow from this insight. For example: **[[What force
posture]{.underline}]{.mark}**---in terms of location, scale, and
capabilities---**[is required]{.underline}** to meet the basic aim of
shield forces: "**[To make it credible to a potential
aggressor]{.underline}** that he will have to contend with an immediate
and effective response by NATO?"76 **[What is the [optimum balance
between the sword and the shield]{.mark}, or deterrence by punishment
versus denial?]{.underline}**77 How can shield forces and NATO members
in Eastern Europe best support NATO's strategic nuclear forces? What is
the utility of a revitalized "flexible response" or "graduated
deterrence" doctrine for deterring a range of Russian aggression? What
levels of response should this doctrine consist of?78 To what extent
should out-of-area operations drive NATO defense planning?79 Modernize
the Sword and the Shield The third insight builds on the second: **[if
NATO revitalizes its sword and shield, both must meet the demands of the
contemporary strategic and operational context]{.underline}**.
**[[Further]{.mark} defense planning [questions stem
from]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[the need to
modernize]{.underline}**]{.mark} NATO's sword and shield. For example:

#### Concept shifted AWAY from non-deterrence issues \-\-- the alliance is focused on deterrence and defense and supporting Ukraine militarily

**[NATO's new Strategic Concept]{.underline}** adopted at the Madrid
summit **[defines Russia as the most significant and direct
threat]{.underline}** to allied security and does not rule out the
possibility of an attack against any of the Allies. **[NATO intends to
strengthen its deterrence and defence posture]{.underline}**, but there
will be no revolutionary change in its military presence on the eastern
flank. **[The compromise reached at the summit implies there will be
limited reinforcements of the existing battlegroups]{.underline}**
**[and a pre-assignment of forces stationed primarily in Western
Europe]{.underline}**. **[Additionally, NATO will develop a new Force
Model by increasing the pool of higher readiness forces fitted into
defence planning and subordinated to SACEUR]{.underline}**. **[This may
prove to be a much more far-reaching decision for the future of the
allied deterrence]{.underline}** and defence posture but it remains to
be seen how it will be implemented in practice. Nor will changes be seen
in the US military presence on the eastern flank from rotational to
permanent -- with the minor exception of the V Corps Headquarters
Forward Command Post. Washington will, though, place a second rotational
brigade in the Black Sea region. Overall, the security of the eastern
flank will be strengthened in the coming years, but not to the extent
expected by those NATO members bordering Russia. Redefining the threats
and challenges The Madrid summit will above all be remembered for the
adoption of NATO's new Strategic Concept, which defines what kind of
organisation it is to become. **[Collective defence will remain its core
mission, with three associated core tasks: deterrence and defence,
crisis prevention and management, and cooperative security. The approach
to these tasks is different than twelve years ago]{.underline}** and
linked with the need to strengthen individual and collective resilience
and to enhance the technological edge which NATO has over its
adversaries. The document also emphasises the importance of the
transatlantic bond and NATO's role as a forum for consultations and
coordination -- thus fulfilling various demands of the Allies. The
strategic environment is defined very differently in the new Concept.
The Euro-Atlantic area is not at peace and an attack against Allies'
sovereignty and territorial integrity cannot be ruled out. The Russian
Federation is defined as the most significant direct threat to the
security of NATO members, and its military build-up and military
integration with Belarus are seen as a challenge to NATO security. This
is a significant change from the 2010 Strategic Concept, which referred
to NATO's wish to develop a strategic partnership with Russia. The
current document mentions neither the NATO-Russia Council nor the 1997
NATO-Russia Founding Act, intended to be the basis for developing
cooperation and strengthening stability in Europe in part through
restrictions on the permanent stationing of substantial NATO combat
forces in the new member states. There is no consensus within NATO to
officially denounce the Founding Act, but there is agreement to avoid
adherence to the constraints which arise from it due to the changed
security situation. Some members still want to keep open the possibility
of returning to the Act as a basis for future relations with Russia. Any
change in NATO's relationship with Moscow, however, will be dependent on
Russia halting its aggressive behaviour and fully complying with
international law. At present, the response to hostile Russian actions
is to strengthen deterrence and defence as well as resilience. At the
same time, NATO seeks stability and predictability and will want to
maintain channels of communication to manage and mitigate risks, prevent
escalation and increase transparency with Russia. Although Russia is
defined as the main threat in the document, due to the 360-degree
approach and indivisibility of allied security, NATO wants to take into
account all threats coming from all directions. Therefore, terrorism is
described as the most direct asymmetric threat to the security of NATO's
citizens and international peace. Conflicts and instability in Africa
and the Middle East are also perceived as a challenge. For the first
time in history, NATO's Strategic Concept mentions China, whose
ambitions and policies challenge NATO's interests, security and values.
It is worth noting that the strengthening of the strategic partnership
between China and Russia and their attempts to undercut the rules-based
international order is at odds with NATO's interests. Other challenges
mentioned in the document include cyber-attacks, emerging and disruptive
technologies developed by adversaries, the erosion of arms control, the
disarmament and non-proliferation regime, and climate change. A remake
of the deterrence and defence posture **[NATO's three core tasks have
been redefined by three factors: the Russian invasion of Ukraine; the
move away from large-scale out-of-area operations sealed with the
withdrawal from Afghanistan; and the rivalry with China]{.underline}**.
**[The priority is deterrence and defence]{.underline}**, with the goal
of denying any potential adversary opportunities for aggression. NATO is
to develop forces, capabilities, plans and infrastructure to deter and
defend, including for high-intensity warfighting against nuclear-armed
peer-competitors. **[The new Strategic Concept places greater emphasis
on the role of nuclear deterrence in NATO's strategy than the 2010
document]{.underline}**. With regard to conventional deterrence,
however, there will be no revolutionary changes when it comes to the
deployment of forces on NATO's eastern flank and no shift from a forward
presence to forward defence, which Poland and the Baltic states favoured
and which would bring a significant increase in the allied presence.
There are several reasons for this -- the diagnosis of Russia's relative
military weakness and the conviction of some NATO members that Moscow is
not able to take aggressive actions against NATO after the invasion of
Ukraine.; the reluctance of the largest member states to engage
significant forces in the region on a permanent basis, as they want to
retain flexibility to operate in other theatres; and the lack of
political will among some members for significant and rapid investments
in a military build-up. For these reasons, a compromise was developed
that consists of limited reinforcements of existing NATO battlegroups on
the eastern flank and pre-assigned combat-ready forces there if
necessary, (without stationing them there). In total, these combined
forces will reach brigade-size units (3,000--5,000 troops) in the Baltic
states and Romania. This is to be complemented by the prepositioning of
ammunition and equipment, improved military mobility, investments in
military infrastructure, intensified training and exercises,
strengthened NATO Command and Force Structure, a faster decision-making
process and a new generation of military plans. **[The lack of
significant changes in the deployment of NATO forces will be offset by
the implementation of the new NATO Force Model]{.underline}**. This is
briefly mentioned in the Madrid summit declaration, but without entering
into detail.\[1\] According to Jens Stoltenberg, **[NATO will increase
the size of its higher readiness forces from the current 40,000 within
the NATO Response Force (NRF) to over 300,000 troops in the new Force
Model]{.underline}**.\[2\] These forces will be pre-assigned to specific
NATO defence plans, will have specific tasks and areas of responsibility
and will be subordinated to SACEUR. They will have an increased level of
readiness of up to ten days (100,000 troops), around 10--30 days
(200,000 troops) and up to 30--180 days (500,000 troops).\[3\] The plans
for the new NATO Force Model are to be completed next year.\[4\] The
first country to publicly declare units for the new Force Model was
Germany. Berlin wants to assign 15,000 troops, including an armoured
division with two brigades, 65 combat and transport aircraft, 20
warships and special forces units.\[5\] The UK has also announced the
assignment of one brigade, an unspecified number of multi-role aircraft
and warships, including an aircraft carrier.\[6\] **[While crisis
management was an important task in the 2010 Strategic Concept, NATO has
far less ambition in this area now]{.underline}**. It wants primarily to
prevent conflicts and to engage less in managing them. It will continue
to maintain capabilities to conduct crisis management operations, but
**[will rather focus on supporting its partners in building their
military and civilian crisis response capacity]{.underline}**.
Similarly, **[the 2022 Strategic Concept is much less focused on
cooperative security]{.underline}**, which was a top priority in 2010.
**[NATO wanted then to concentrate on arms control, disarmament and
non-proliferation,]{.underline}** on an open-door policy and
partnerships, including with Russia. Nowadays, NATO underlines the
importance of enlargement policy, mainly in connection with the planned
accession of Finland and Sweden. Before the Madrid summit, it was not
entirely clear whether Turkey would lift its objections to them joining
NATO. In the end, the three countries signed a trilateral memorandum on,
among other issues, countering terrorism, which opened the way for both
countries to be invited to join NATO, to sign the accession protocols
and for NATO members to ratify those documents. The memorandum does not
however spell out how long Turkey will take to ratify the process, and
it retains the possibility to prolong or block it.\[7\] In 2022 the
development of relations with partner countries is also important for
NATO. Relations with the Western Balkan and Black Sea countries are
considered as crucial -- Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia and Ukraine
were explicitly mentioned. NATO will continue to support Ukraine
cautiously, sticking to the consensus that sending military aid is the
responsibility of member states and is coordinated outside NATO.
Nonetheless **[members have agreed to an updated comprehensive
assistance package to Ukraine that includes the supply of secure
communications, fuel, medical assistance, protective equipment and
portable anti-drone systems]{.underline}**. In the long term, NATO also
wants to support Ukraine in the transition from Soviet-era military
equipment to modern Western weapons systems but with regard to technical
support rather than arms supplies. In second place, the Middle East,
North Africa, the Sahel, and the Indo-Pacific region were mentioned in
the Strategic Concept. Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea
were invited to the NATO summit for the first time.

of arms control\". The International Institute for Strategic Studies.

DL

The NATO 2022 Strategic Concept significantly downgrades the focus on
arms control as the principle tool for managing conflict and arms races
in favour of risk reduction, conflict management and confidence-building
measures -- compared to the last Strategic Concept released back in
2010. This was to be expected in an era when the concept of negotiating
with Russia on any topic remains out of bounds. **[The Russia and China
policies expressed]{.underline}** in the new Strategic Concept
**[are]{.underline}** also **[important and break with past
policies]{.underline}** in several key areas. The fact that the
Strategic Concept mentions China at all is notable because NATO
documents very rarely do so. And **[it uses Cold War-style language
regarding Russia that is stronger than that which has been used in any
of the post-Cold War strategic concepts]{.underline}** (in 1991, 1999 or
2010).

More specifically, **[the new Strategic Concept describes Russia as a
'direct threat']{.underline}**, **[which is the strongest use of
language]{.underline}** to describe Russia **[since 1991]{.underline}**.
The 1991 Strategic Concept (the first to be issued publicly by NATO)
hailed cooperation with the Soviet Union in the context of breakthroughs
in arms control with the United States and Europe. However, quite
presciently, it also said that potential future malign changes in Soviet
forces were 'a factor of which the Alliance has to take account'. **[The
2022 Strategic Concept lays out a new Russia policy]{.underline}**,
**[stating that '\[t\]he Russian Federation is the most significant and
direct threat to]{.underline}** Allies' security and **[to peace and
stability]{.underline}** in the Euro-Atlantic area.' **[Russia had been
NATO's strategic 'partner']{.underline}** **[in the previous Strategic
Concept]{.underline}**, and this is a clear statement that it has become
a threat.

**[The 2022 Strategic Concept is]{.underline}** also **[the
first]{.underline}** NATO strategic document **[to mention
China.]{.underline}** The 2019 London Summit Communiqué was the first
mention of China in any NATO-agreed public statement since December
1965. The Strategic Concept states in paragraph 13 that **[China's
'stated ambitions and coercive policies challenge our interests,
security and values']{.underline}**, which is consistent with language
in the 2021 Brussels Summit Communiqué.

The Strategic Concept also discusses risk reduction and transparency as
potentially useful ways to approach arms control with both Russia and
China. Regarding Russia, it states that 'NATO does not seek
confrontation and poses no threat to the Russian Federation' (par. 9).
Therefore, NATO will 'remain willing to keep open channels of
communication with Moscow to manage and mitigate risks, prevent
escalation and increase transparency. We seek stability and
predictability in the Euro-Atlantic area and between NATO and the
Russian Federation.' Meanwhile, regarding China, it asserts that NATO
will 'remain open to constructive engagement with the PRC, including to
build reciprocal transparency, with a view to safeguarding the
Alliance's security interests'.

The Strategic Concept discusses the problems facing the current
instruments of the global arms-control and non-proliferation regime, but
it does not offer much in the way of solutions. Paragraph 18 is very
specific in describing the problems:

The erosion of the arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation
architecture has negatively impacted strategic stability. The Russian
Federation's violations and selective implementation of its arms control
obligations and commitments have contributed to the deterioration of the
broader security landscape. The potential use of Chemical, Biological,
Radiological and Nuclear materials or weapons against NATO by hostile
state and non-state actors remains a threat to our security. Iran and
North Korea continue to develop their nuclear and missile programmes.
Syria, North Korea and the Russian Federation, along with non-state
actors, have resorted to the use of chemical weapons. The PRC is rapidly
expanding its nuclear arsenal and is developing increasingly
sophisticated delivery systems, without increasing transparency or
engaging in good faith in arms control or risk reduction.

However, it is not until later in the document that the Allies describe
their views about the future of arms control. The document turns first
to strategic stability, falling back on the definition of arms control
provided by the 1967 Harmel Report: deterrence and defence must come
first and then, on that basis, arms control. It is interesting to note
that this specific description of strategic stability does not specify
that it applies only to Russia, and it was also not placed, as in
previous documents, in the context of NATO-Russia or US-Russia arms
control. Therefore, by inference, NATO's approach to strategic stability
can apply to China: 'Strategic stability, delivered through effective
deterrence and defence, arms control and disarmament, and meaningful and
reciprocal political dialogue remains essential to our security' (par.
32).

Then, in the same paragraph, the Strategic Concept continues by
discussing the Alliance's traditional approach to arms control (to which
I am proud to have contributed when I was a staff member at NATO):

Arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation strongly contribute to
the Alliance's objectives. Allies' efforts on arms control, disarmament
and nonproliferation aim to reduce risk and enhance security,
transparency, verification, and compliance\[.\]... We will make use of
NATO as a platform for in-depth discussion and close consultations on
arms control efforts.

Paragraph 32 also contains new, unexpected language that engages with
issues of crisis management and crisis prevention instead of arms
control as a focus for practical work ahead:

We will pursue all elements of strategic risk reduction, including
promoting confidence building and predictability through dialogue,
increasing understanding, and establishing effective crisis management
and prevention tools. These efforts will take the prevailing security
environment and the security of all Allies into account and complement
the Alliance's deterrence and defence posture.

The unexpected element here is that it signals a new concept of
operations for NATO on how to pursue 'arms control' in an era when there
are no recognisable arms-control agreements or proposals on the table.
By focusing on action related to tools from the broader security
toolbox, such as strategic risk reduction, dialogue, responsible
behaviours and crisis management and prevention, NATO is opening the
aperture quite wide on the ways to pursue the key aim of arms control --
preventing unintentional conflict -- while at the same time
strengthening Allied deterrence and defence. The last sentence in the
passage cited just above is key to understanding how little appetite
NATO has for chasing grand ideas in arms control with Russia today and
for the foreseeable future.

The section of **[the Strategic Concept discussing arms control ends by
referencing]{.underline}** the 1970 Treaty on **[the]{.underline}**
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (**[NPT]{.underline}**). There is
no notable departure from the language used in previous strategic
concepts and, **[importantly, there is no mention of the]{.underline}**
Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (**[the Nuclear Ban
Treaty]{.underline}**), which seems quite wise (**[given the Allies'
well-known opposition to the treaty and their persistent status as
objectors]{.underline}**):

The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is the essential bulwark against
the spread of nuclear weapons, and NATO remains strongly committed to
its full implementation, including Article VI. NATO's goal is to create
the security environment for a world without nuclear weapons, consistent
with the goals of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

**[Lastly]{.underline}**, **[the new Strategic Concept endorsed an
approach towards arms control in outer space and cyberspace that focuses
on responsible behaviour]{.underline}** (par. 25), **[which is a nod to
the ongoing work at the United Nations]{.underline}** (inspired by the
UK government) **[on reducing space threats through norms, rules and
principles]{.underline}**:

**[We recognise]{.underline}** the applicability of **[international law
and will promote responsible behaviour in cyberspace and
space]{.underline}**.

**[The]{.underline}** 2022 **[Strategic Concept]{.underline}** and its
perspective on arms control **[is clearly in line]{.underline}** **[with
the new direction]{.underline}** **[taken by NATO member
countries]{.underline}** beginning at the 2014 NATO Summit in Wales,
**[held in the wake of the war launched by Russia against
Ukraine]{.underline}** in February of that year and its annexation of
Crimea. Arms-control optimism is now gone; pessimism has set in;
**[Russia is a threat; China is a challenge]{.underline}**; and risk
reduction and crisis prevention are the preferred tools, alongside
deterrence and defence, for safeguarding the Alliance.

This week at their Madrid summit, **[NATO]{.underline}** allies
**[formally invited Finland and Sweden to join]{.underline}** the
Alliance. **[It was the latest step in a whirlwind
process]{.underline}** **[initiated by Russia's invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}** and delayed by Turkey---home to the
second-largest military in the Alliance, after the United States---which
argued that the Nordic countries did not sufficiently address Turkey's
national-security concerns. After weeks of tough negotiations, Turkey,
Finland, and Sweden agreed to a breakthrough trilateral declaration on
Tuesday.

Atlantic Council IN TURKEY asked experts for their take on the
implications of the summit and the trilateral declaration.

**[A victory for NATO unity and cohesion]{.underline}**

The ongoing Russian aggression in **[Ukraine]{.underline}** since 2014
**[has entirely changed]{.underline}** **[the security
landscape]{.underline}**, not only in the Euro-Atlantic area, but
**[globally]{.underline}**. **[It has fundamentally
altered]{.underline}** **[threat perceptions]{.underline}** beyond the
Alliance, **[leading Finland and Sweden to officially
apply]{.underline}** for membership in NATO. These two countries have
indeed crossed the Rubicon and deserted their neutrality in response to
persistent Russian belligerence in the middle of Europe. Their decision
to combine their efforts and assets with the Alliance against Russian
aggression is natural and legitimate. Hence the need to incorporate
Finland and Sweden into the Alliance family.

**[The trilateral memorandum]{.underline}** signed among Turkey,
Finland, and Sweden on June 28 is a welcome development designed to
**[demonstrate NATO's solidarity and unity, and further strengthen the
Alliance.]{.underline}**

It is commonplace in NATO to consult on and negotiate over any dispute
among allies and would-be allies to find a common ground. That is how
NATO plays its role, and at the end a solution accommodating such
concerns is found by consensus.

It is also true that once new members accede to NATO, they are bound by
the decisions previously taken by the Alliance on a wide range of
subjects. In NATO there exists a robust set of decisions and practices
in fighting terrorism, beginning with the intervention in Afghanistan.
Therefore, there is already an agreement comprising all sorts of
conceptual work and practices in different geographical theaters on
combatting terrorism, developed within NATO and binding on all members.

**[The newly adopted Strategic Concept]{.underline}** (SC) **[clearly
identifies Russia]{.underline}** and "terrorism, in all its forms and
manifestations" **[as the primary]{.underline}** sources of
**[threat]{.underline}**s in a 360-degree manner and across all three
core tasks of NATO: collective deterrence and defense, crisis prevention
and management, and cooperative security. Given that terrorism is "the
most direct asymmetric threat to the security of our citizens and to
international peace and prosperity," as defined in the SC, it makes
sense both for Finland and Sweden to cooperate with Turkey in combatting
terrorism as one of the primary sources of threats against Alliance
interests.

In a nutshell, collective deterrence and defense against actual and
potential adversaries, nipping crises in the bud, and expanding the web
of networks with partners under challenging circumstances are the main
tasks of NATO in the next decade.

**[The main center of gravity for NATO is its solidarity, unity, and
cohesion]{.underline}**, including all allies and those set to become
allies.

**[The summit decisions]{.underline}** in their entirety will **[help
NATO to navigate the troubled waters]{.underline}** ahead **[over the
long term]{.underline}**.

time for a sweeping transformation of the alliance\". POLITICO.

DL

**[Offering a convincing blueprint]{.underline}** for the kind of
sweeping transformation NATO will have to go through **[to address the
return of great power competition, the alliance's freshly agreed new
Strategic Concept]{.underline}** is the product of inevitable
compromise. However, the document adopted at last week's Madrid Summit
also **[stands out for its comprehensiveness and balance]{.underline}**
--- as well as its ambition.

And yet, on its own, it's still not enough.

**[Against the backdrop of]{.underline}** the ongoing war in
**[Ukraine]{.underline}**, **[NATO's original task of collective defense
is now]{.underline}** --- unsurprisingly --- **[front and
center]{.underline}** once more, **[with the alliance planning to step
up its high-readiness forces from 40,000 to over 300,000]{.underline}**
by 2023.

In addition, transatlantic leaders also smartly avoided a mere
back-to-basics approach, reinterpreting the other two core tasks
introduced by the 2010 Strategic Concept --- crisis management and
cooperative security --- in order to meet the changed realities of
today's contested international environment.

As a result, **[cooperative security]{.underline}**, which in the
previous strategic document had been closely linked to a "reset" in the
relationship with Moscow, **[is now geared toward leveraging NATO
partnerships to counter Russia as "the most significant and direct
threat to Allies' security," in addition to China.]{.underline}**

Indeed, **[for the first time, the Strategic Concept now spells out how
NATO can contribute to dealing with an increasingly assertive and
militarily capable China]{.underline}** --- a subject that made it into
the alliance's internal discussions just a few years ago --- as
Beijing's military and technological advances will require staying
vigilant.

#### Deterrence and collective defense-focus now

**Simón & Arteaga \'22**

(Luis Simón Director of the Research Centre for Security, Diplomacy and
Strategy (CSDS) & Félix Arteaga, Research Professor in International
Security at the Brussels School of Governance, 1/17/22, \"NATO gets an
update: the Madrid Strategic Concept\"; Real Instituto Elcano;
https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/analyses/nato-gets-an-update-the-madrid-strategic-concept/)

Deterrence and defence **[NATO endorsed its posture of deterrence and
defence]{.underline}** **[after]{.underline}** the **[ratification of
the Lisbon Strategic Concept]{.underline}** as a means of having a
combination of capabilities appropriate to a range of possible
scenarios.\[7\] In the absence of a specific adversary, the capabilities
to be established could only be generic, but **[the Russian invasion of
Crimea in 2014]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** its burgeoning
**[hostility]{.underline}** **[forced the Alliance's military posture to
be redefined]{.underline}**. **[NATO had to deploy forces on its Eastern
border to reassure]{.underline}** the **[allies]{.underline}** and
strengthen its capacity for deterrence. The Russian aggression forced
the natural procedure to be inverted and, since 2014, NATO has had to
adapt its deterrence and defence posture to the new situation without
waiting for the formal review of the Lisbon Strategic Concept. It began
by strengthening its reassurance and adaptation measures on its eastern
flank (its Readiness Action Plan) in 2014,\[8\] followed by a review of
its military strategy (MC 400/4) in 2019, the adaptation of its defence
and deterrence in the Euro-Atlantic region (Defence and Deterrence in
the Euro-Atlantic Area, DDA) in 2020 and NATO's fundamental concept of
combat (NATO Warfighting Capstone Concept, NWCC) in 2021.\[9\] In recent
years NATO's military authorities have thus been establishing the
doctrine, goals and capabilities needed to confront the Russian threat
before the political concept that will require them is approved. The new
military developments are not known in detail given their confidential
nature, but amid a specific threat such as Russia's they will have been
tailor-made to address it, and therefore will be less reactive than
those envisaged in the current Strategic Concept, which are restricted
to awaiting an armed attack before responding. The new military strategy
will need to address the new forms of confrontation in all domains
(land, sea, air, outer space and cyberspace) and in their conventional
and non-conventional forms (hybrid war), a more proactive and
anticipatory shift in focus that now requires a political justification.
As matters stand, the necessity now arises of reconciling the political
component of the Madrid Strategic Concept with the military strategy
already adopted, which could present problems if one or several allies
disagree with the new terms of military planning. Spain has contributed
and will continue to contribute to collective deterrence on NATO's
eastern borders, meaning that it will not be difficult to adapt itself
to the new deterrence and defence guidelines from a military point of
view. It may be more difficult to acknowledge the Russian Federation as
a threat and to act accordingly from the political perspective, because
Spanish strategic culture is reluctant to put a name to threats to
national security and because adopting the necessary measures would
incur major political and economic costs. Russia, China and strategic
competition The North Atlantic Council described Russia's aggressive
conduct as a 'threat' at its June 2021 meeting in Brussels,\[10\]
together with terrorism and other asymmetrical threats such as hybrid
threats, disinformation and cyberattacks. Numerous acts jeopardising
Euro-Atlantic security were listed and laid at Russia's door, and
consequently Russia is going to provide the adversary that the Alliance
lacked in the Lisbon Strategic Concept. With China, the Council's
communiqué was more cautious: the country was described as a 'systemic
challenge' to the international order and it was called upon to behave
more responsibly within this order. However, while the NATO 2030 report
drawn up by a group of experts did not deem China a 'military threat'
like Russia, it placed it on an equal footing in terms of threat to the
security of the Alliance. The **[allies]{.underline}**, including Spain,
**[will need to endorse]{.underline}** the **[characterisations in the
Madrid Strategic Concept and]{.underline}** the **[respective
measures]{.underline}** to reverse these types of behaviour. The
**[measures to be]{.underline}** **[taken against the Russian
threat]{.underline}** already seem to be **[defined in the new allied
strategy]{.underline}**, but it remains to be seen what measures are
adopted against China. The allies are faced with the dilemma of how to
address the geopolitical rivalry between China and the US and to take
preventative measures to deter and defend their security interests
against Chinese power in the European region, the scope of its global
capabilities and, above all, the application of its disruptive
technologies to erode NATO's military superiority.\[11\] In this
context, the NATO 2030 report warns about China's strategy of
civil-military fusion, whereby Beijing seeks to acquire the intellectual
copyright and advances of European and Western research centres and
companies with the goal of boosting its own military development. All
the foregoing presents the **[Madrid Strategic Concept]{.underline}**
with the need to use a public language of diplomacy that explains the
reasons and consequences of **[returning to a strategy of deterrence and
containment]{.underline}**. This constitutes a significant communication
effort because the **[allies]{.underline}** and their citizens have
become **[accustomed over]{.underline}** the course of **[various
decades to]{.underline}** **[prioritise crisis management
to]{.underline}** the **[detriment of collective defence and
deterrence]{.underline}**. **[It was a habit they]{.underline}**
**[hurriedly had to abandon in 2014 after]{.underline}** the **[Russian
annexation of Crimea]{.underline}** and required halting the freefall in
military spending and committing to investing 2% of GDP by 2024 (NATO
Defence Investment Pledge). **[Spain]{.underline}** is not one of the
allies most affected by geographical proximity to Russia or the
Asia-Pacific, but it must **[share its allies' concern
about]{.underline}** the **[growing physical presence of these
countries]{.underline}** in its space of strategic interest in the
Mediterranean and Africa and about the virtual reach of their hybrid
capabilities to destabilise national security. The tendency of Spanish
strategic culture is inclined to prioritise détente over deterrence, but
it will have to revise this inclination if the Madrid Strategic Concept
incorporates binding containment measures against the Russian and
Chinese threats. The Alliance's functions **[NATO has three fundamental
functions]{.underline}**: **[collective defence]{.underline}**,
**[crisis management and]{.underline}** **[cooperative
security]{.underline}**, with none of these taking precedence. The
**[Madrid Strategic Concept will have to]{.underline}** address the
situation on NATO's eastern flank and experiences such as Afghanistan so
as to **[prioritise collective defence]{.underline}**
**[against]{.underline}** the **[Russian threat]{.underline}**,
**[to]{.underline}** the **[detriment]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}** its functions of crisis management and
**[cooperative security]{.underline}**. As well as priorities, the
allies **[will have to weigh whether]{.underline}** **[to add new
functions to]{.underline}** the **[traditional list,]{.underline}** and
candidates such as resilience, cybersecurity, pandemics and
technological disruption, among others, are all under consideration.
Prior to the Lisbon Strategic Concept, the usefulness of crisis
management operations --referred to variously as international,
humanitarian or, in Spanish terminology, peace-keeping missions-- was
being called into question. It was agreed in Lisbon to halt combat
missions in Afghanistan in 2014 and promote the construction of local
capabilities as a way of avoiding new interventions within the function
of cooperative security. The outcome of operations in Libya and
Afghanistan had the effect of discrediting the crisis management
function, at least whenever it involves mass troop deployments on the
ground, and the **[Madrid Strategic Concept should reduce]{.underline}**
its **[priority]{.underline}** **[compared to deterrence]{.underline}**,
**[which is necessary against the Russian threat,]{.underline}** and
cooperative security, which is necessary in order to strengthen local
partnerships.

**[After years of its relevance being questioned]{.underline}** by
former President Trump and even being described as 'brain-dead' by
French President Macron, **[NATO is meeting at Madrid at a time of
renewed strength and invigoration]{.underline}** of the alliance. **[The
past few months have witnessed significant alliance
cohesion]{.underline}** **[in the face of]{.underline}** Russia's
aggression in **[Ukraine, with two new states, Sweden, and Finland, set
to join]{.underline}** after Turkey has lifted its opposition. **[NATO's
cause for existence]{.underline}** **[has never seemed
clearer]{.underline}**, **[yet]{.underline}** serious rifts remain, and
the **[unity]{.underline}** of the alliance **[is not
guaranteed]{.underline}** as the war in Ukraine goes on and domestic
pressures across member states increase. Putin's invasion of Ukraine has
led NATO closer to Russia's borders, not further away, and more troops
will be permanently stationed on NATO's eastern flank, including a new
permanent U.S. base in Poland. For Putin, this is undoubtedly the
opposite effect of what he intended, however Ukraine is no closer to
joining NATO and the prospect of a prolonged conflict in its disputed
territories will likely stall Kyiv's accession for the foreseeable
future.

As NATO members meet in Madrid, there are two main challenges that
alliance members will have to contend with. The first is continued
isolationism and retrenchment in the U.S. amongst both Democrat and
Republican lawmakers, including former President Trump. Washington is
increasingly keen to pivot its resources to the Indo-Pacific and its
strategic competition with China. As such, the U.S. is eager to see
European member states spend more on their own defence to be able to
rapidly respond to their security threats should U.S. leadership be
absent or directed elsewhere. **[Defence spending amongst alliance
members is increasing]{.underline}**, and while Germany's Zeitenwende or
'turning point' marks a notable shift in German defence policy, **[there
is the risk of it being]{.underline}** a **[cosmetic rather
than]{.underline}** a **[practical]{.underline}** watershed, with
tangible results likely years away. Support for an increase in German
defence spending remains stubbornly low, with notable resistance coming
from Chancellor Scholz's own Social Democrats as well as other coalition
members.

In addition, the cost-of-living crisis, economic, and energy security
factors are likely to test European member states' support for Ukraine
as the autumn and winter loom. This has already divided NATO member
states between those who wish to see a full Russian withdrawal and for
Ukraine to regain control of the entirety of its territory, versus those
who think Kyiv should accept a peace settlement with Russia to avert
further bloodshed and economic pain in Europe. Poland, the Baltic
states, the US, and the UK fall into the first camp, whilst France,
Germany, Hungary, Italy, and several others fall into the second. **[The
alliance]{.underline}** may **[now]{.underline}** be **[formally
united]{.underline}** **[in recognizing the scale of the threat from
Russia]{.underline}**, but it is not united as to the degree that that
threat should trump individual member states' economic and security
needs. 'Ukraine fatigue' is already setting in and it looks likely to
increase as the months drag on, something that Moscow is all too eager
to exploit.

For NATO, the past few months leading to the **[Madrid]{.underline}**
summit **[has]{.underline}** also **[been a wake-up call]{.underline}**
as to the real source of Moscow's antagonism. **[The 2022 Strategic
Concept rightly identifies Russia as 'the most
significant]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[direct
threat]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}** Allies'
**[security]{.underline}** and to peace and stability in the
Euro-Atlantic area.' It is a bold statement after years of cohabitation
and cooperation with Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when
NATO membership remained on the table for Moscow as it charted its new
course. Russia under Vladimir Putin has long railed against NATO
enlargement and seen it as a threat to Russia's security interests at
its periphery. However, the invasion of Ukraine is about much more than
NATO enlargement and Western influence. Rather, NATO is the easy
scapegoat and object of Moscow's ire to help distract from Putin's
neo-imperial ambitions that are less a result of the collapse of the
Soviet Union and more a result of the waning days of the Russian Empire.
Catherine the Great, rather than any Soviet era leader, is the model in
Putin's quest to restore long-lost Russian territory and glory, making
NATO's aims and strategic outlook look fundamentally modern and fit for
the 21st century in comparison. Putin is focused on the past while NATO
is focused on the present and the future, something that wasn't clear at
the start of this year, but which has now been presented in stark terms
because of Russia's war of aggression.

**[Whilst Russia is the most immediate threat]{.underline}** to NATO
member states, given its geographical position, **[for NATO to remain
forward-looking and relevant China has come to occupy a more prominent
spot]{.underline}** on the list of threats. This is so as **[Russia is
no longer a superpower but a]{.underline}** **[declining
power]{.underline}** **[capable of inflicting great harm]{.underline}**
upon its neighbours, yet posing no immediate threat to the structure of
the global order. A heavily sanctioned Russia under Putin will exist as
a pariah state for some time, while **[China will continue to threaten
its neighbours in the South China Sea, all while increasing its economic
and security influence from Eurasia to Central Europe and even Latin
America. China has the bandwidth and political will to create new
threats and challenge the global order]{.underline}**, **[whilst Russia
can act as a spoiler]{.underline}** to the global order without having
the capacity to present meaningful alternative alliances or systems of
governance. Russia has retained its allies in the BRICs grouping of
nations, but it will always be the junior partner to China, which has
significant leverage in crafting the course of its relations with
Moscow.

The Madrid Summit also marks a major turning point for NATO and
transatlantic relations in (a) the post-Cold War, (b) post-9/11 and (c)
post-Afghan War eras. **[The alliance is]{.underline}** adapting to new
threats and challenges whilst expanding its membership, all while
**[recommitting resources]{.underline}** **[to its original strategic
adversary. It is easy to conclude]{.underline}** that **[NATO has the
upper hand and Moscow will fade into irrelevance]{.underline}**, it's
actions in Ukraine proving that it should have no place at the table of
respectable nations. **[However]{.underline}**, **[NATO's continued
strength and unity is]{.underline}** **[far from assured]{.underline}**,
and it will be important for European leaders not to become complacent.
At the beginning of 2022, few would have predicted that NATO would be in
the position it is today. A moment of crisis can unexpectedly galvanise
an alliance of 30 very different member states stretching across three
continents and with distinct histories. However, it can also reveal
where true interests and values lie, and where the fissures that will
inevitably outlast the current crisis are located and threaten the
alliance's response to the next challenge once the platitudes and
commitments made in Madrid are long past. **[For now]{.underline}**,
however, **[Madrid]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** its own form of
**['Zeitenwende']{.underline}**, **[an unexpected but welcome watershed
moment]{.underline}** **[that demands bold and inspiring
action]{.underline}** amidst political upheaval.

**[The summit was an impressive show of resolve to counter Russia's
aggression]{.underline}**, **[including through continued diplomatic,
economic, and military support for Ukraine]{.underline}**. NATO pledged
to further expand its military support for its vulnerable allies along
the Russian frontier. In particular, **[the United States announced that
it will establish a permanent headquarters for its V Corps in
Poland]{.underline}**. Most important was the eleventh-hour agreement
that Turkey reached with Finland and Sweden, by which Ankara lifted its
objections to their joining the alliance and allowed NATO to begin the
accession process.

**[However, challenges remain]{.underline}**. **[Burden-sharing is a
perennial issue]{.underline}**: **[Even after Russia's assault on
Ukraine]{.underline}**, the majority of members fall short of their
commitment to spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product
(GDP) on defense. The laggards include, most importantly, Germany,
although it has taken steps recently to meet that target as a multiyear
average. Moreover, **[in the weeks ahead, the alliance's resolve will be
tested,]{.underline}** **[as strains over rising inflation and concerns
over energy and food supply mount across the Euro-Atlantic
region]{.underline}**. In **[recent weeks, France, Germany, and Italy
have expressed interest in finding a negotiated settlement to the
conflict, which would likely leave some seized Ukrainian territory in
Russian hands.]{.underline}** **[That position is vehemently opposed by
Poland and the Baltic states]{.underline}**, among others. **[Though
those differences were pushed into the background during this summit,

External risks. The participants found it questionable whether allies
will be able to find a common conventional threat that would be
perceived as strong enough to "transcend the domestic pressures and the
concept of sovereignty." Although an absence of external threat to the
Alliance is very unlikely, **[the [future risk]{.mark} will [lie in
multiplication of external threats and a lack of common perception of
those threats]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} This **[underdeveloped
common understanding of external threats, accompanied by differential
threat assessments, [could weaken NATO's
cohesion]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To illustrate this point**[, although
the survey participants listed the failure to activate Article 5 in case
of attack as a potential risk, further discussions showed that
non-Article 5 missions could constitute the real test for NATO's
cohesion]{.underline}**. In words of the one of participants, "if there
is an operation and only two nations show up, this is not cohesion." For

compatibility of Turkey's bilateral actions and its participation in

partners and allies is fraught---to say nothing of Turkey's huge
domestic economic challenges and rising political uncertainty---perhaps
close U.S. and European collaboration can find a path to the stronger,
more stable relationship that would benefit all three. CORNELIUS ADBEHR:
ON IRAN After four years of increasing transatlantic confrontation over
Iran policy following America's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal,
expectations of a joint approach with the incoming Biden administration
were high. The past twelve months have seen solid cooperation, if also
underwhelming progress on the dossier. Initially, the concern was that
European allies might not be prepared to accommodate a decisive U.S.
return to the negotiating table, as announced by Biden on the campaign
trail, even though they had been the ones keeping the agreement alive.
This turned into frustration over the sluggish pace of the
administration to make tangible offers for a reopening of the talks. The
Islamic Republic has had its own role in stalling progress, from
refusing to conclude the negotiations before a presidential election in
June to slow-walking their resumption for five months after. Given the
country's advances in nuclear technology as well as in the stockpiling
of highly enriched uranium, the urgency to restore the limits set by the
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, as well as the
International Atomic Energy Agency's inspection regime, is obvious.
However, with both Iran and the United States constrained by domestic
politics that do not reward compromise with an adversary, any agreement
to relax U.S. sanctions in return for the reintroduction of stringent
nuclear controls will have to be carefully calibrated. The continued
focus on the nuclear file, though, belies a reality that is moving on.
Israel has been establishing relations with Arab Gulf countries, and its
new government is much less opposed to a nuclear accord than the
previous one. Countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates, in turn, have begun to speak with Tehran directly about their
security concerns, sensing that Washington is, slowly but surely, on its
way out of the region. Meanwhile, Russia has gained an active security
presence in the region via the Syrian theater while maintaining strong
ties with Israel. Lastly, China remains a sought-after commercial
partner that is gaining political clout as a result of America's turn
toward Asia. It is these shifting geopolitical sands that should make
the focus on regional cooperation an imperative for the coming year.
Ideally, such a move would follow a revival or renewal of the JCPOA, the
"longer and stronger" deal that Washington aspires to. However, the
chances of failure increased during 2021, so a push for some kind of
security arrangement is critical, especially in case talks should
falter. The alternative is another violent conflagration that benefits
only a handful of cynics, and not the people in the region itself. ERIK

//um-ef)

The announcement comes at a time when the Alliance is working on a new
Strategic Concept. Innovation will be key to preserving NATO's edge, as
the Secretary-General pointed out in his 2030 food for thought paper.
[**[Although NATO is a potent defence organization]{.underline}**,
**[emphasis on emerging tech]{.underline}**]{.mark}nologies [**[reveals
its Achilles' heel]{.underline}**. **[A]{.underline}**]{.mark}rtificia[l
**[i]{.underline}**n]{.mark}telligence, autonomy[,
**[biotech]{.underline}**]{.mark}nology, quantum technology[, **[and
other tech]{.underline}**]{.mark}nologies [**[are at the heart
of]{.underline}** **[geoeconomic competition]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
Geoeconomic competition unfolds around the projection of economic power
within and across the domains of land, air, sea, space, and cyberspace
to achieve political goals. [**[Today's geoeconomic dynamic defines
winning business models amid]{.underline}** **[a growing
dichotomy]{.underline}** **[between market-driven and state-driven
nations]{.underline}**]{.mark}. It aims to set the rules, principles,
and standards that guide economic activities and access to and ownership
of emerging technologies. [**[NATO's]{.underline}** current **[emphasis
on emerging tech]{.underline}**nologies **[with defence and commercial
applications risks making the Alliance subject to this new geoeconomic
dynamic]{.underline}**. **[This dynamic can undermine NATO's innovation
agenda and endanger its strategic edge]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
Therefore, NATO needs to respond. First, NATO needs to embrace the
realities of economic security seriously. This call flows logically from
Article 2 of the North Atlantic Treaty, encouraging allies' economic
collaborations. In our view, economic security combines national
security and economic policy with technology and innovation policy to
identify economic disruptions. It also prevents these disruptions from
arising and strengthens a coping capacity to deal with economic
emergencies. **[Economic security [requires allies, for example, to
engage on defence-critical standards, advancing transparency for defence
supply chains,]{.mark} and considering the interplay between technology
development, foreign direct investment, and export
control]{.underline}**. Therefore, the new Strategic Concept should
incorporate economic security as an essential element. Second, economic
security requires NATO to shape mindsets about defence investments and
sustainability. Already today, defence companies face financial
challenges as banks cancel bank accounts or refrain from covering export
risks. **[The emphasis on environmental, social, and governance criteria
(ESG) that increasingly shapes and determines financial investments will
reinforce these problems as defence is considered toxic]{.underline}**.
But a narrow interpretation of ESG that considers defence incompatible
with the world view underpinning ESG is detrimental to NATO's ambition
to invest in companies. It also means other investors will likely shy
away from investing in the same companies.

For quite some time, **[[NATO has been grappling with divergent threat

did nothing to reconcile or systematize these views. Instead, the
alliance opted for **[[an umbrella approach where every threat is deemed
equally acute]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This **[[oversized
umbrella]{.underline}]{.mark}** may have kept everyone's threat
perceptions dry for **[now]{.underline}**, however, **[[there is only so

[willpower]{.mark}]{.underline}** to go around. Sooner or later the
**[[alliance]{.mark} will [need to]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[prioritize]{.underline}**.]{.mark} For those nearest Russia, it's
crystal-clear Putin is not only NATO's greatest threat, but also one
which the alliance is best suited to confront. In the 21st century, NATO
needs to return to basics, with territorial defense as its primary goal.
**[[NATO cannot try to be]{.mark} [everywhere]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
the world **[doing everything [all the
time]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[[Keeping Russia at bay
requires]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[alliance to
address]{.underline}]{.mark}** the full range of Russian aggressions
against NATO members: [**[aerial incursions]{.underline}**,
**[cyber-attacks]{.underline}**,]{.mark} **[energy
coercion]{.underline}**, **[espionage]{.underline}**, and
**[propaganda]{.underline}**. It must also be able to deter Russia's use
of conventional and nuclear arms. Facing daily arrivals of migrants from
North Africa, our Mediterranean allies view migration and terrorism as
NATO's greatest security threat. And then there is the gnawing reality
of China's rise, with its implications for transatlantic security. These
are secondary threats to the alliance. Nonetheless, NATO has some
(albeit limited) role to play in keeping them in check. Yet in the
Brussels Summit Communiqué, climate change gets top billing as a threat
to the alliance. This suggests that NATO, now with Team Biden calling
the shots, views climate as NATO's greatest threat, or at least as
important as the other threats mentioned: Russia, China, instability in
Europe's near abroad, and the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction. At the summit, NATO adopted a "Climate Change and Security
Action Plan." Among other things, it commits the alliance to conducting
an "annual Climate Change and Security Impact Assessment" and to mapping
and analyzing greenhouses gases from military installations and military
activities. "Furthermore," the plan states, "data on energy demand and
consumption in the military could inform Allies' investment decisions,
help define the role of Emerging Disruptive Technologies and innovative
energy efficient and sustainable technologies, as well as inform
operational planning." The Summit Declaration goes further, inviting the
Secretary General to "formulate a realistic, ambitious and concrete
target for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by the NATO
political and military structures and facilities and assess the
feasibility of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050." This is not to say
that climate change isn't real, nor that it has implications for NATO
member states or theaters (particularly the Arctic). NATO, however, is
not the right organization to lead on addressing these issues. There is
now a very real possibility that the alliance's new climate focus, with
its reporting and consultation requirements, will become a distraction
which undermines collective defense. Worse yet, NATO's drive to hit
arbitrary emission targets could lead some nations to make choices which
weaken transatlantic security. Why invest in emissions belching tanks
when you can buy light armored cars? Why invest in fifth-generation
fighters when many new aircraft consume more fuel than older platforms?
Why invest in capabilities at all when you can invest in carbon capture
technology and wind farms? Scaling up to challenge Russia's increased
presence in the High North? Expect headwinds ahead under NATO's climate
turn. How about joint exercises, the lifeblood of NATO's continued
interoperability and readiness? Could they one day be reduced to lower
emissions? And what of the alliance's adversaries? The idea that Russia,
the world's fourth-largest carbon emitter, or China, the world's largest
emitter by far, are going to allow emissions targets and climate change
concerns restrain their military acquisitions, basing, or operations is
farcical. Many of our NATO **[[allies are still struggling to
meet]{.underline}]{.mark}** their [**[defense]{.underline}** **[spending
commitments]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Their militaries suffer from glaring
capability gaps. **[[Siphoning scarce resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[NATO]{.underline}** special operations forces **[have been slow to
adopt innovative solutions]{.underline}** such as Tactical Assault Kit,
despite its attractive and innovative features. What explains this
resistance? Resistance to innovation is at once puzzling, intellectually
intriguing, and a commercially interesting phenomenon. In the 1940s, the
German psychologist Kurt Lewin was the first to introduce a systemic
understanding of the resistance phenomenon. The cause, according to
Lewin, is not found in the mind of the individual employee, but in the
dynamics of opposing forces, including the behavior of leadership.
According to the political economist Josef Schumpeter, "Innovation is
the creation of new combinations that represent a departure from
established practices." In other words, **[a technological tension
between the need to innovate and the desire to maintain order and
stability will always exist]{.underline}**. Wendell Wallach nicely
defines **[the problem]{.underline}** as **["the pacing
gap"]{.underline}** **[between the introduction of a new technology and
the establishment of laws, regulations, and oversight mechanisms for
shaping its safe development]{.underline}**. Wallach believes that
**[modern tech]{.underline}**nological innovation is **[occurring at an
unprecedented pace, making it harder than ever to govern using
traditional legal and regulatory mechanisms]{.underline}**.
**[NATO]{.underline}** as a whole suffers severely from the pacing gap,
due to the fact that it **[consists of 29-member
countries]{.underline}**. If a new communication technology is proven
highly successful by one country, **[the product still has to be vetted
by each country's security and intelligence services]{.underline}**.
**[A process like this takes time and consumes resources]{.underline}**,
**[forcing poorer nations]{.underline}** to evaluate the importance of
**[a new technology]{.underline}** versus the old. This process
**[exacerbates the pacing gap within NATO as standardization becomes a
protracted process of having to generate consensus among the member
states]{.underline}**.

**[After years of transatlantic stress, officials and observers in
[Brussels believe that]{.mark} a [Biden]{.mark} administration [holds
the prospect of profound change in style]{.mark} and policy. There will
continue to be areas of disagreement. But the overall approach from
Washington is sure to be more engaging and closer to mainstream European
policy preferences.]{.underline}** **[From]{.underline}** economics to
**[security]{.underline}**, **[[Europe values predictability in U.S.
leadership]{.mark},]{.underline}** something that has been in remarkably
short supply under the Trump administration. The anticipated shift is
likely to be most profound from the perspective of the EU and its
institutions. Among member states, there was always a spectrum of views
about Donald Trump. The outgoing administration's approach enjoyed a
degree of support in right-wing and nationalist circles, including
several governments in Central and Eastern Europe. For some, this was a
matter of ideology. For others it was a cooler geopolitical calculus. In
general, however, the **[Trump]{.underline}** administration **[was
derided for its brash unilateral style]{.underline}** as much as its
policy choices, most of which were at odds with EU preferences. The list
of sharp differences ranged from climate policy to trade, from Iran to
the World Health Organization. Above all, Trump and his key advisors
were seen as dismissive of, or even opposed to, the idea of the EU
itself. For them, international politics seemed to be about nation
states, often individual leaders---some seen positively, most seen
negatively. The traditional U.S. attachment to the "European project"
had become the preserve of a foreign policy elite with little influence
on Trump and his circle. A **[Biden administration should spell a return
to the traditional balance in transatlantic relations, with the EU
itself taken seriously again alongside relations with France, Germany,
and others.]{.underline}** On substance, there is a realization that it
may not all be smooth sailing across the Atlantic. Trade and digital
policy are widely assumed to be the most challenging areas. Indeed,
there is some concern that Biden may find it difficult to move away from
the protectionist stance that has taken hold in recent years, against
the backdrop of similar pressures in Europe and elsewhere. On other
fronts, the outlook is for closer consultation and convergence. EU
leaders will welcome a U.S. return to the Paris climate accords and the
World Health Organization. Biden has signaled a desire to bring the
United States back into the multilateral nuclear agreement with Iran. A
Biden administration is assumed to be more interested in and willing to
assist with a host of problems on Europe's periphery, from Africa to the
Eastern Mediterranean. In some respects, NATO was one of the areas least
affected by Trump's approach to the world. The U.S. military presence in
Europe has grown modestly but steadily; a trend that began under
President Barack Obama. U.S. complaints about defense burden-sharing
were nothing new, even if the style was more abrasive. But from the
start, **[[Trump spread anxiety about the solidity of the U.S.
commitment to European defense]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It never quite
came to a disavowal of Article V, and Trump would have faced a very
tough bipartisan battle if he ever wished to leave NATO as he hinted on
more than one occasion. By contrast, **[it is assumed that a Biden
administration would put NATO back at the core of U.S.
strategy]{.underline}**. In policy terms, the emphasis on increased
European defense spending will surely continue. There will be a tougher
and more predictable line on Russia, coupled with an interest in new
arms-control arrangements. Biden is a well-known figure in NATO circles.
For the alliance, a Biden administration will be a return to the known
world and an energizing element for the institution.

Technology advances. The participants agreed that **[[technology
advances are important for NATO's continued
cohesion]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Technology will constitute a
significant intervening factor in how NATO nations maintain their
cohesion in the future for three reasons. First, ever-evolving
communication technology can facilitate the spread of risks coming from
outside of the Alliance and exacerbate their negative effect. The
examples that resonated the most during focus group sessions are
information warfare and targeted propaganda against NATO nations.
Internet communications technology creates infinite room for alternative
media that distort reality, contribute to the emergence of populist and
radical movements, and increase the danger of miscommunication among
nations. Second, NATO risks losing the innovation game to the commercial
defense industrial sector. In the future, private companies will
continue to stay ahead of NATO in designing specifications and setting
standards for platforms. This can have a major impact on readiness and
interoperability among NATO nations if their innovation efforts (e.g.,
the U.S. Third Offset Strategy) do not materialize.31 Third, **[[some

#### Info-sharing and non-deterrence measures trade-off with NATO deterrence measures and cause overstretch

Relations, \"It Will Take More Than a Biden Victory to Solve NATO's
Strategic Malaise,\" pg online @

If and when the Biden team embarks on its grand European tour, it seems
virtually certain that, beyond the expressions of gratitude for
America's "return" that will surely follow them wherever they go, the
delegation can expect to be met with a lengthy list of items requiring
their immediate attention. Moreover, appeals for Washington's assistance
are likely to differ from capital to capital, with **[each NATO ally
arguing]{.underline}** that **[their particular issue or concern
represents]{.underline}** the **[most pressing challenge]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** therefore **[requires]{.underline}** the most
attention and **[resources]{.underline}**. In Warsaw and the capitals of
the Baltic states, the U.S. delegation will hear that, despite a new
U.S. rotational troop deployment, a revanchist Russia necessitates
additional NATO (but especially U.S.) military commitments along the
Eastern flank of the alliance. In Rome, Athens, and Madrid, U.S.
policymakers will learn that the Mediterranean countries represent the
"soft underbelly" of NATO and that the alliance must do more to project
stability along its southern arc of instability. In Ankara, the message
will be one of anger directed at what the Erdogan government perceives
as NATO's collective failure to support Turkish actions in Syria and
elsewhere. In Paris, the message for the U.S. delegation will be that
the alliance must strengthen its counter-terrorism efforts in the Middle
East and North Africa, while in Berlin the focus will be on reforming
NATO's nuclear posture and salvaging expiring arms-control agreements.
Meanwhile, securing the Arctic and halting the effects of climate change
will be at the top of the agenda in Copenhagen and Oslo. In short,
**[wherever]{.underline}** the **[Biden]{.underline}** presidential
delegation **[goes]{.underline}**, **[it will be met with
requests]{.underline}** that Washington --- and with it, **[the NATO
alliance]{.underline}** --- **[prioritize]{.underline}**
**[everything]{.underline}**, thereby **[fulfilling]{.underline}** the
old **[adage that]{.underline}**, "**[When everything is a priority,
nothing is a priority]{.underline}**." Given the precarious state of
international relations today, the temptation to do more is
understandably strong. It is easy to understand why, in the present
climate of global instability, calls for the transatlantic alliance to
reinforce and strengthen its existing commitments while simultaneously
adding new mandates, missions, and programs are popular. **[Rather
than]{.underline}** **[adding more items to its]{.underline}**
**[already crowded agenda]{.underline}**, however, the **[time has come
for]{.underline}** not just the United States but also **[NATO to
consider doing less but]{.underline}** doing it
**[better]{.underline}**. When More Is Less, and Less Is More For an
alliance that has long prided itself on its commonality of purpose and
interests, the truth is that NATO is in danger of losing both. **[On
paper]{.underline}** and in public, the **[members]{.underline}** still
**[agree]{.underline}** the **[core purpose of]{.underline}** the
71-year-old **[alliance is deterrence and defense]{.underline}** of the
North Atlantic region. When internal disagreements are aired publicly,
other allies are quick to dispel reports of rifts by pointing out that
differences of opinion are nothing new. **[But]{.underline}**
**[unlike]{.underline}** during the **[Cold War]{.underline}**, when a
single adversary occupied all of the alliance's attention, **[today's
security environment]{.underline}** --- as the allies routinely remind
each other --- **[is multifaceted]{.underline}** and complex. In an
effort to address members' often disparate security requirements,
**[NATO]{.underline}** has **[taken on additional tasks
over]{.underline}** the **[past three decades]{.underline}** almost as
quickly as it has taken on additional members. The **[NATO-ization of
every security challenge]{.underline}** has meant that issues once
considered the purview of individual nations or other international
organizations --- such as **[migration]{.underline}**,
**[terrorism]{.underline}**, and **[foreign security]{.underline}**
force assistance --- are now **[lumped onto NATO's agenda]{.underline}**
**[under]{.underline}** the **[guise of fulfilling its
ambitious]{.underline}** (and potentially limitless) post-Cold War
**[mandate of "projecting stability]{.underline}**." For far too long
now, **[alliance leaders]{.underline}** have tasked the NATO military
infrastructure with a seemingly impossible undertaking: **[weighing
down]{.underline}** the military **[organization with]{.underline}** new
responsibilities like **[peacekeeping and
counter-terrorism]{.underline}** **[while]{.underline}** simultaneously
**[allowing members to]{.underline}** **[shirk on
contributing]{.underline}** the **[resources]{.underline}** required to
fulfill old and new alliance missions. To date, much of the criticism
surrounding **[NATO's current strategic deadlock]{.underline}** has
**[focused on]{.underline}** the **[resource]{.underline}**
**[issue]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** the
**[strains]{.underline}** **[caused by uneven
burden-sharing]{.underline}** within the alliance. Far less attention
has been paid to the first part of the "ends-means-ways" formulation of
strategy, namely NATO's original purpose. While addressing "means" and
"ways" are crucial elements in any strategic enterprise, it is past time
the Allies got around to focusing on NATO's strategic ends once more.
**[Confronting NATO's present strategic dilemma]{.underline}** will
require looking beyond existing strategic documents like the 1949 North
Atlantic Treaty, which proclaimed the signatories' commitment to the
"preservation of peace and security" in the North Atlantic area. As the
past three decades of NATO transformation have shown, there is not much
that does not fit under the rubric of fostering "peace and security" and
consequently cannot be tacked onto the alliance's agenda. True strategy
**[requires setting]{.underline}** (**[and adhering to]{.underline}**)
actual **[goals and priorities]{.underline}**, as well as developing
plans to achieve them. Although the alliance's past strategic documents
have often sought to define NATO's evolving strategic purpose with more
precision than the founding treaty, the alliance has not adopted a new
strategic concept since 2010 for fear that embarking on such an exercise
would only further inflame the deep rifts within the alliance that such
strategic endeavors are meant to help address. Officially, **[NATO
members]{.underline}** still **[assert collective]{.underline}**
**[defense]{.underline}** is the alliance's primary task, despite the
inclusion of two other core tasks --- **[projecting stability and
cooperative securit]{.underline}**y/crisis management --- in all three
of its post-Cold War Strategic Concepts (1991, 1999, 2010). The
**[addition of these latter two core tasks]{.underline}** --- coupled
with members' differing threat perceptions about what rises to the level
of an existential security threat --- **[has]{.underline}** **[clouded
the organization's focus]{.underline}**. **[After]{.underline}**
**[three decades]{.underline}** **[of continual
adaptation,]{.underline}** the **[danger that]{.underline}** the
**[alliance's original]{.underline}** **[raison d'étre of collective
defense]{.underline}** **[gets]{.underline}** further **[downgraded
to]{.underline}** the point where it risks **[becoming]{.underline}**
**[primus inter pares among NATO's many other responsibilities is
real]{.underline}**. As with previous critical junctures in
transatlantic relations, it will take American leadership to change
NATO's future course. Come January 2021, a Biden administration should
move swiftly to announce its intention to commission a new NATO
strategic concept by 2022. Should Trump win, all bets are off. Defenders
of NATO's post-Cold War emphasis on projecting stability and collective
security argue that NATO has a proven track record of crisis management
and capacity-building beyond its borders in places like Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The alliance's cooperative
security track record, however, is hardly stellar. This past June, the
NATO-led international peacekeeping force in Kosovo entered its 22nd
year of operation. Almost 17 years after the alliance's Integrated
Military Command first assumed responsibilities in Afghanistan, the NATO
flag continues to fly in Kabul, where some 15,000 allied troops remain
as part of NATO's Resolute Support mission. Nor can the alliance's
intervention in Libya in 2011 be considered a resounding success,
judging by the state of affairs there today. That NATO remains engaged
in some of these places decades afterward is not an impeachment of the
men and women who served in these operations and performed the tasks
demanded of them. It is, howevwer, evidence of NATO's failure to give
sufficient consideration to its core strategic purpose. While one can
debate the wisdom of NATO having accumulated such an expansionist
security agenda in an era marked by American unipolarity, an
all-encompassing approach to security is harder to justify in a time of
waning American power. Just as the diminishing threat of great-power
competition in the 1990s and early 2000s freed NATO to take on
additional security tasks beyond its traditional mission of collective
defense, its return should prompt a reexamination to determine whether
NATO is still the appropriate entity for handling such tasks. **[Another
center of excellence]{.underline}**, special representative, **[or
office will not fix what ails NATO]{.underline}**. As the authors of a
recent Heritage Foundation report on "NATO in the 21st Century" put it,
it is time for NATO to get "back to the basics." There are limits to
what an international institution --- even one as successful as NATO ---
can accomplish: "When policymakers expect or want NATO to do what it was
never designed to do, that is when the Alliance risks failure." The
launch of NATO Secretary Gen. Jens Stoltenberg's #NATO2030 reflection
process earlier this year to address political reforms within the
alliance presented just such an opportunity to tackle these and other
big-picture questions. It is still unclear to what extent the pandemic
has delayed the work of the group of experts begun last March. The Biden
team will have to move quickly if it hopes to help shape the working
group's deliberations, as Stoltenberg is slated to brief members on the
path forward for the alliance at the April 2021 Leaders' Summit. Back to
the Future: Narrowing (Not Broadening) NATO's Remit **[Looking
ahead]{.underline}**, **[alliance leaders should]{.underline}** consider
ways to **[streamline current NATO missions]{.underline}** and tasks
**[so that responsibilities]{.underline}** **[that]{.underline}**
**[fall below the threshold of]{.underline}** **[existential challenges
can be unloaded onto other multilateral institutions]{.underline}**
**[or]{.underline}** **[global partnerships]{.underline}**. In addition
to bringing an end to the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan,
alliance leaders should consider getting NATO out of the security
assistance and stabilization business altogether. Calls for NATO to look
for opportunities to do more in the MENA region should also be rebuffed.
Few would dispute that this region poses real **[security challenges to
European states]{.underline}** or that these challenges **[are
particularly acute]{.underline}** for the southernmost members of the
alliance, some of whom might even view migration and refugee flows as
**[rising to the level of]{.underline}** **[existential
threats]{.underline}**. But while the 21st century challenges to the
"stability and well-being" of member states may be numerous and growing,
there is only one NATO. A single organization cannot tackle every
national security challenge its members face. To remain useful, the
**[alliance must]{.underline}** **[choose which threats to
prioritize]{.underline}**. **[Doing so requires recognizing
that]{.underline}** **[not every security issue]{.underline}** **[rises
to the level of]{.underline}** an **[existential threat
to]{.underline}** the **[alliance]{.underline}**. Terrorist attacks were
a common occurrence in many West European nations in the 1970s and
1980s, yet NATO did not fundamentally transform its agenda back then
because members recognized that the threat posed by the Soviet Union was
greater. While neither Russia nor China as yet represents a threat on
par with the Soviet Union, NATO should prepare for the possibility that
the latter (either alone or in combination with
**[Moscow]{.underline}**) **[could pose an existential
challenge]{.underline}** to the Atlantic community in the coming
decades. Nor is it evident that NATO was ever the appropriate venue for
tackling threats like terrorism in the first place. Effective
counter-terrorism requires intelligence-sharing; local policing and
counter-radicalization programs; and financial instruments that agencies
like Europol, Interpol, the Global Counterterrorism Forum, and others
are better equipped to lead than an overstretched military alliance. The
same is true when it comes to other activities the transatlantic
alliance has added to its roster since 1991, like stabilization missions
and security sector reform. In fact, organizations such as the United
Nations, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and
the European Union provide more appropriate venues for tackling many of
the collective security duties the alliance has assumed since the 1990s.
As a regional defensive military alliance, **[NATO's comparative
advantage lies in providing territorial defense]{.underline}** against
other states or groups of states. This is a comparative advantage that
should be preserved, not diluted by the addition of other security
tasks. True comparative advantage arises from specialization.
**[Continuing to add more and more security responsibilities to NATO's
already-full]{.underline}** **[plate]{.underline}** **[risks
transforming]{.underline}** the **[military alliance into]{.underline}**
a **[glorified clearinghouse]{.underline}** **[or administrative
apparatus]{.underline}** **[whose]{.underline}** **[sole task is
the]{.underline}** **[facilitation of information-sharing]{.underline}**
**[rather than]{.underline}** the provision of **[collective
defense.]{.underline}** Yes, NATO is better equipped to handle the
myriad security problems its members face than any other multilateral
security organization in existence today. But the proposition that
because NATO has the resources and coordinating mechanisms it should
automatically take on the latest mission du jour is what has led to a
strategically deadlocked alliance. Much like the 1990s, the coming
decade will be one of transition for NATO. Back then, proponents of
alliance reform argued that the only way forward was to enlarge the
alliance and take on new responsibilities. Without such reforms, they
claimed, NATO would disappear. The choice facing NATO members today is
different: not a world without NATO, but a world in which NATO fails to
fulfill its intended purpose. Preparing NATO for China's rise does not
mean sending alliance-flagged vessels to the South China Sea. But the
reality is, as Stoltenberg put it last December, China is already
"coming closer to us." Ultimately, NATO possesses few capabilities of
its own. Individual allies --- and not the alliance itself --- retain
ownership and control over the military material and personnel assigned
to NATO operations and missions. The **[alliance's real
strength]{.underline}**, however**[, lies in its integrated military
command structure]{.underline}**. Preserving and protecting the
integrated command structure's organizational bandwidth should be the
primary focus in the coming years. **[Unloading]{.underline}** the
**[alliance's collective security responsibilities]{.underline}**
**[onto other international actors]{.underline}** would
**[allow]{.underline}** alliance **[military officials to focus
on]{.underline}** the challenges emanating from China (and, to a far
lesser degree, **[Russia]{.underline}**) **[free of the need to also
tackle]{.underline}** a host of **[lower-threshold security
concerns]{.underline}**, all of which require office space, funding, and
personnel billets. Bifurcating collective security tasks from collective
defense would also force European leaders once and for all to decide
exactly what price they are willing to pay for their own national
defense. The Way Forward **[Instead of seeking to tackle every new
security challenge]{.underline}** of the 21st century,
**[NATO]{.underline}** leaders **[should work to preserve]{.underline}**
NATO's **[core assets and capabilities]{.underline}** for the task that
it is uniquely suited for: **[deterring state-based
adversaries]{.underline}** and defending the territorial integrity of
its members. The **[time when NATO could]{.underline}** be
**[both]{.underline}** a **[collective defense]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** a **[collective security]{.underline}**
organization **[has passed]{.underline}**. Amid the reemergence of
great-power rivalries, **[it no longer makes sense to assign NATO's
limited resources to naval operations in support of]{.underline}** the
**[refugee crisis]{.underline}** as the organization did back in 2016.
Or for the alliance to continue to try its hand at stabilizing war-torn
nations. NATO has survived this long by adapting. But unlike in the
past, where NATO adaptation has always meant taking on more
responsibilities, the **[reforms needed today are]{.underline}** those
that involve **[shedding commitments]{.underline}** **[rather than
taking on additional]{.underline}** **[ones]{.underline}**. In seeking
to **[reestablish NATO]{.underline}** once again **[as]{.underline}** an

Cold War. Jettisoning the collective security responsibilities the NATO
alliance has assumed over the past three decades won't be easy. Nor does
freeing NATO from responsibility for tackling issues like
counter-terrorism and instability in the near abroad mean that such

However, it seems that with every Russian military engagement over the
past 30 years, the Kremlin's threshold for aggression has fallen ever
lower. **[As Moscow's desire for self-assertion has increased, the
west's response has often been too soft or accommodating]{.underline}**.
**[For Nato allies, deterrence has worked]{.underline}** so far and we
have not experienced military aggression. **[But since Putin is not
prepared to play by the same rules as the rest of us, we have no
guarantees. We need a fundamental shift in approach]{.underline}**: we
need **[to move from deterrence by punishment to deterrence by
denial]{.underline}**. In other words, we me must be ready to prevent
Russia taking a single inch of Nato territory, rather than simply trying
to reconquer occupied enclaves. **[We need to rethink our objectives ---
first and foremost, we must prepare stronger defences.]{.underline}** In
light of the changed security environment, we need **[to double the
speed and scale of our efforts to boost our military posture across the
alliance]{.underline}**. The overall aim is to be able to put in place a
credible defence capability anywhere on Nato territory, from the very
beginning of a conflict. We cannot wait for another massacre such as the
one in Bucha to happen before taking action. To do this, Estonia and its
fellow Nato members need to shape up. First, **[governments must trust
military personnel to build readiness]{.underline}**. Not in drawing up
defence or security policy, but **[in proposing the best solutions
according to military science]{.underline}**. **[Those with practical
experience on the battlefield can decide how best to invest the allotted
money to defend their country.]{.underline}** Second, **[states must
invest wisely. There is no point in acquiring the most modern technology
if you don't have the people, the skills or the funds to sustain it, or
enough ammunition to use it,]{.underline}** in case of a conflict.
Unfortunately, **[these foundations do not sound exciting, and cannot
easily be displayed to adversaries]{.underline}**. How do you present at
a parade the amount of training, ammunition, communication systems or
equipment maintenance you have undertaken, which are all critical in
warfare? Third, **[Nato and its allies need to prepare much more
comprehensively for swift and viable deployments at the first signs of
aggression]{.underline}**. We must deny Russia any military success
anywhere on the alliance's territory. The aim is not to intimidate: when
deploying forces to Nato countries, we should not measure how much
deterrence those aircraft, ships or tanks are providing. Instead, we
must assess how ready the forces are to fight in case of need. And if it
is not sustainable to keep the necessary number of forces to
counterbalance Russia permanently stationed in frontline Nato countries,
then we need to have a credible defence plan for emergency deployment.

Although Trump has now left office, **[NATO is]{.underline}**
nonetheless **[in for difficult times]{.underline}**, as strategic
circumstances change and China's rise draws American attention toward
East Asia. Though some European NATO members now express interest in
helping to counter Beijing, and the alliance itself is working to stake
out a position on China's rise, as the NATO Reflection Group Report
underscored in November 2020, **[the United States will inevitably be
more invested in Asian developments than will other NATO
members]{.underline}**.16 **[The net result presents]{.underline}** two
possible **[avenues for deeper, substantive divides in the
alliance]{.underline}**. First, if competition with Beijing escalates,
the United States may be impelled to devote fewer resources and
attention to European affairs. This would invert the Cold War
experience, creating the potential for the alliance to wither away as
American attention moves elsewhere and NATO's European members seek
alternatives for their security. Alliances, after all, usually change as
new threats appear; as American priorities change, NATO cohesion may
decline as well. Then, too, European actors might also be expected to
complain about prospective American "abandonment." Mounting
Chinese--American competition may also encourage NATO's European members
to distance themselves, perhaps dramatically, from the United States.
During the contest with the Soviet Union, European allies regularly
feared that Soviet--American tensions might entangle them in a conflict
with Moscow at times and places beyond their control. A U.S.--China
contest would carry even greater risks. With less at stake in Asia,
**[NATO's European members can be expected to separate themselves from

**[The war in Ukraine has provided a wake-up call for U.S. military
cyber defenders,]{.underline}** **[who are facing hard choices
about]{.underline}** **[how to deploy limited resources]{.underline}**,
said Air Force Brig. Gen. Chad D. Raduege, the chief information officer
of U.S. European Command. "**[There's been a realization
that]{.underline}**, quite frankly, **[we can't protect everything we
have]{.underline}**," Raduege told a virtual luncheon hosted by the
Gabriel Chapter of the Air Force Association on March 9. He added that
**[this realization had been growing for some time]{.underline}**. In
his prior job in 2021 as chief information officer of Air Combat
Command, "we found ourselves ... identifying the key \[IT\] components
for us to fly, fight, and win. And **[we were applying mission defense
teams from a cyber component against those weapon systems and saying,
these are our crown jewels that we need to protect]{.underline}**." But
**[faced with a crisis that is demanding agile U.S. deployments
alongside a wide variety of partners]{.underline}**, meaning small teams
operating from unfamiliar locations, **[there weren't enough cyber
defense teams to go around]{.underline}**, Raduege said, answering an
audience question from retired Maj. Gen. Burke E. "Ed" Wilson, the
former deputy assistant secretary of defense for cyber policy, who
previously commanded Air Forces Cyber. "I think the area that we've got
to continue to figure out is this idea that we were going \[to\] protect
the weapon systems themselves, protect those smaller groups, with our
mission defense teams. That's a really great vision. **[What we found is
we didn't have enough capacity in the cyber realm to even stand up some
of those capabilities]{.underline}**," Raduege said. He said **[the Air
Force is deciding which weapon systems it can afford to
protect]{.underline}**. "The Air Force, right now, through Air Combat
Command, is working through a prioritization of which weapon systems we
will apply those mission defense teams against," he said. **[The
overwhelming "demand signal" for cyber protection]{.underline}**,
Raduege said, **[was driven by the circumstances of the U.S. response to
the Ukraine crisis]{.underline}**, **[which combined NATO military
operations with humanitarian relief efforts involving a much wider
alliance of partners---all requiring connectivity]{.underline}**.
"There's **[an insatiable appetite to have connectivity]{.underline}**.
And we're seeing not only fielded forces at the home stations, but now
we have all of these tactical edge airfields and logistics hubs that are
standing up," Raduege said. "We have fielded forces all over the place
that have an air picture that they want to share. ... We have logistics
hubs that are all over the European theater right now. ... We're seeing
our own nation want to put donations and goods into the European
theater. And so we're seeing coordination centers stand up" to manage
that flow of incoming goods and their onward distribution.
**[Coordination was required, not just with the 30-member NATO alliance,
but with "a whole bunch of other allies and partners for this current
fight]{.underline}**," he said. "**[And the ability to track all of that
aid, all of that hardware and software that is going into different
places]{.underline}** ... **[requires information-sharing
requirements]{.underline}** at a protected military level," Raduege
said. That secure connectivity required developing the mission partner
environment, or MPE, "a coalition network," which could move data,
classified as highly as "secret," securely between the military networks
of allied nations. The MPE was an alternative to the "sneaker net"-style
of manual exchanges NATO partners had to cope with for many years in
Afghanistan, but Raduege suggested that some kinks still being worked
out.

The abovementioned **[incidents have led cyber-conflict scholars to
point to several technical and practical difficulties in the operational
integration of cyber effects]{.underline}**.29 In the interviews and
background conversations that contributed to this study, three of these
**[difficulties were continuously reiterated when discussing successful
integration of cyber effects into NATO operational planning: the
temporal dimension of developing exploits; the assessment of battle
damage; and the problem of confliction.]{.underline}** Developing
exploits---a matter of time One of the characteristics of cyber attacks
that receives most attention is the fact that they hit suddenly and
without warning.30 While this is often the case, the central question
for operational integration is not the speed at which they hit their
target, but the speed with which the tools and techniques that exploit
IT vulnerabilities in order to deliver cyber effects can be developed.
Like conventional weapons, **[the cyber tools---the exploits or cyber
weapons---take time to develop.]{.underline}** However, **[an exploit is
often harder to reuse than a conventional weapon, as it is more
dependent on a meticulous analysis and target preparation---in this
case, specifically, the target's IT infrastructure. Without knowing the
adversary's IT systems and its vulnerabilities better than the adversary
itself, meaningful cyber weapons are impossible to develop. The fact
that knowledge about the target is linked not only to the deployment of
a weapon but also to its development influences the extent to which it
can be used and reused]{.underline}**. Stuxnet, for example, required
years of development, testing and perfecting before it could deliver the
intended effect on the Iranian centrifuges. Despite the techniques used
in the Stuxnet malware having been found in other malware,31 Stuxnet
lost its ability to destroy the centrifuges when it was discovered and
the IT vulnerabilities that enabled it were patched. Importantly, part
of the complexity of Stuxnet relates to the US--Israeli intention to
keep the effect secret. **[In a hot conflict, secrecy in terms of the
effect is often less important, and thus the development and deployment
of cyber effects do not necessarily have to be as complex and
time-consuming.]{.underline}** This observation does not necessarily
change the fact that the development of exploits often has to precede
the military confrontation in which they are intended to be used**[.
NATO states that want to deliver cyber effects in NATO operations must
try to gain access to Russia's or other potential adversaries' critical
military networks to identify and exploit IT
vulnerabilities]{.underline}**. As several informants emphasized, if
states wait for a conflict to escalate before they begin the development
of exploits, it is most likely to be already too late.32 **[The
alternative to penetrating adversary networks in peacetime is for states
to rely on the exploitation of vulnerabilities in as many commercial
off-the-shelf products as possible]{.underline}**. This can be done, for
example, **[by purchasing exploits from private companies offering this
service, in the hope that it will then be possible to quickly create an
overview of the enemy's IT infrastructure and adapt the exploits to this
environment when a conflict escalates.]{.underline}** **[The latter
approach is more likely to succeed against adversaries with low network
security, which does not apply in the case of Russia, or in contexts
where less sophisticated and less closely targeted cyber effects are
required. Whether member states develop sophisticated exploits for
future targeted effects or stockpile well-known exploits to cause more
minor effects, they cannot]{.underline}**---as several informants
indicated---**[be certain that they will be able to deliver the cyber
effect at the specific time it is requested]{.underline}** by CYOC.
**[This is because the IT vulnerabilities upon which exploits depend
might not exist for ever. Cyberspace is a dynamic environment:
vulnerabilities are patched, systems are updated or replaced and bad IT
security practices are identified and improved]{.underline}**. This
means that **[exploits are temporary]{.underline}** in nature **[and
cannot be stored for later]{.underline}** use.33 States must constantly
ensure that the exploits still work, which requires minor adjustments
when updates take place. **[As a consequence, the larger the military
'cyber arsenal', the more technically skilled human resources are needed
for its maintenance. In the current labour market, where recruitment and
retention of a cyber workforce is difficult, extensive investment is
required for states to be able to stand ready with cyber effects
available when requested.]{.underline}** In short, **[if a state is to
offer a cyber effect in a NATO operation, then the state is likely to
have to be able, first, to predict what Russian IT systems it is going
to target months or years in advance, and second, to marshal the
necessary resources to develop and maintain a large array of exploits
that can be used against these systems. Even if this is successfully
done, the state still faces difficulty in ensuring that an effect is
delivered as promised.]{.underline}**

President Joe Biden has issued grave warnings that Russia might launch a
cyberattack against the United States in retaliation for the punishing
sanctions levied after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. He's advised
American companies to "accelerate efforts to lock their digital doors,"
and many officials expect an attack against critical U.S. infrastructure
to be inevitable. One way Biden and other Western leaders are attempting
to deter potential Russian cyber retaliation during the Ukraine crisis
is through NATO's Article 5 collective defense pledge --- that an attack
on one is an attack against all. That's because since the 2014 NATO
summit in Wales (which, coincidentally, took place following another
Russia-Ukraine crisis), the alliance has affirmed that Article 5 extends
to cyberspace. In other words, a cyberattack against any NATO member
could conceivably represent an attack against the entire alliance. The
pledge is the embodiment of the allies' security guarantee to each other
and the beating heart of NATO. After Russia invaded Ukraine, NATO
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg confirmed that NATO policy on
collective defense and cyberspace holds strong, noting that NATO has
"decided to make clear that a cyberattack can trigger Article 5." And
following an extraordinary meeting of heads of state and government on
March 24, the alliance reinforced that it is "ready to impose costs on
those who harm us in cyberspace." But despite this rhetoric, exactly how
and when Article 5 applies to cyberspace remains unclear. This ambiguity
is a problem --- with potentially disastrous consequences. Staking the
credibility of Article 5 to what are often murky activities in
cyberspace threatens to undermine the broader principle of collective
defense. We can't risk fracturing the transatlantic alliance at a
critical juncture in its history over a debate on what constitutes a
major or minor cyberattack. For that reason, NATO should move quickly to
clarify its policy on cyberattacks and explicitly state the threshold
for what would trigger an Article 5 response. Furthermore, **[NATO
members should commit to treating]{.underline}**
**[cyberattacks]{.underline}** that do **[not]{.underline}** rise to the
level of a **[major attack as a national matter --- not one for the
alliance. Such a shift might face some initial
resistance]{.underline}**, particularly in light of the Kremlin's
history of malicious cyber activities. One of the first state-initiated
cyberattacks was perpetrated by Russia against Estonia, a NATO member,
in 2007. In the intervening years, Moscow has increased its malicious
cyber activities, such as the SolarWinds breach uncovered in December
2020 in which Russia gained access to a treasure trove of U.S. data.
Russian President Vladimir Putin's maneuvers against NATO members, along
with the annexation of Crimea in 2014, spurred the alliance to adopt a
Cyber Defense Pledge in 2016 that recognized cyberspace as a military
domain. Two years later, NATO created a Cyberspace Operations Center in
Mons, Belgium to improve situational awareness and coordinate cyber
operations. Since then, the alliance has consistently reaffirmed the
application of Article 5 to cyberspace. At the 2021 summit in Brussels,
NATO committed to a new Comprehensive Cyber Defense Policy, with allies
agreeing to employ the "full range of capabilities" at all times to
"deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats."
Notably, NATO refined its language with last summer's summit communique
to account for the fact that some cyber incidents may not be
individually decisive, but nevertheless significant when viewed in the
aggregate. Specifically, the allies recognized "the impact of
significant malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain
circumstances, be considered as amounting to an armed attack." In
practice, however, NATO leaders have avoided clarifying the conditions
under which a cyberattack would trigger Article 5 and how NATO would
respond. When pressed about Russian cyberattacks in the Ukraine context,
Stoltenberg cautioned that, "we have never gone into the position where
we give a potential adversary the privilege of defining exactly when we
trigger Article 5." This equivocation is not surprising, for several
reasons. **[The nature of cyberspace often confounds unequivocal
deterrence declarations. States tend to operate in cyberspace with
plausible deniability, which can make it difficult to rapidly ascertain
responsibility for cyber incidents]{.underline}**. Also, **[it can be
challenging to understand the intent behind observed cyber behavior, and
there is often a substantial time lag between when an initial
penetration of a network occurs and when the target even realizes the
breach]{.underline}**. And **[the vast majority of cyber operations
cause virtual, not physical, damage, complicating efforts to assess and
evaluate the implications of the costs inflicted]{.underline}**.
Moreover, **[it can take time to develop and identify a way to
infiltrate a network as well as the computer code that takes advantage
of a vulnerability for malicious ends. This means states may lack a
palatable cyber response option for retaliatory purposes at the desired
time.]{.underline}** This creates a slew of practical problems if
Article 5 were to be invoked for a cyberattack. **[From an
implementation perspective, it would trigger deliberations within the
North Atlantic Council]{.underline}**, NATO's primary decision-making
body. **[Decisions made within the NAC]{.underline}** **[require
unanimity, which can be difficult to achieve for many issues but is
especially burdensome for cyber ones, given all of the ambiguities
outlined above. The most likely outcome of this process would be a long,
drawn-out deliberation resulting in a divided alliance unable to agree
on how or whether to respond]{.underline}**. Quite simply, some allies
are unlikely to want to risk World War III for a cyberattack that
disrupts the financial infrastructure, for instance, of another country
but doesn't lead to loss of life or sustained damage. These challenges
have major strategic implications for NATO. After years of publicly and
repeatedly linking Article 5 to cyberspace and reinforcing that policy
in response to the Ukraine conflict, **[a failure to achieve consensus
and respond to]{.underline}** a Russian c**[yberattack]{.underline}**
against a NATO member could imperil Article 5 in other areas. The
**[disunity that is likely to be revealed during NAC deliberations would
then undermine]{.underline}** the **[broader political
cohesion]{.underline}** that has, for the most part, been remarkably
strong throughout the war in Ukraine. This would make it more difficult
for the alliance to respond to other forms of Russian behavior. As Biden
emphasized at a press conference last month, "the single-most important
thing is for us to stay unified ... We have to stay fully, totally,
thoroughly unified." NATO has achieved some strategic ambiguity with its
current cyber policy, which may help to deter high-stakes Russian
assaults during the present crisis. However, rather than an all-out
Russian cyberattack, a far more plausible scenario is a lower-level
attack carried out by the Russian government or a proxy group against
one or more allies. In this case, the alliance's interests --- not to
mention transatlantic security --- would be better served by adopting
nationally-tailored responses rather than pulling the Article 5 lever.
Additionally, to prevent further escalation and reinforce the implicit
firebreak that currently exists between cyber and conventional military
operations, NATO allies should also agree to restrict any retaliatory
response against Moscow to the cyber realm or non-military instruments
of power. With little chance of improved NATO-Russian relations any time
soon, time is of the essence to get this right. **[The allies should
begin the hard political legwork now to ensure members get on the same
page before NATO's June summit,]{.underline}** if not sooner.
**[Achieving consensus on significant cyber issues has previously taken
time]{.underline}**. **[NATO's attribution of the Microsoft Exchange
hack]{.underline}** last summer to China was an important step for the
alliance and sent a strong signal to our adversaries. But **[it took
months to reach agreement on the statement;]{.underline}** the hack was
uncovered in March 2021 and the NATO statement was not made public until
July. In the current crisis, the alliance will not have the luxury of
waiting four (or more) months to agree on a response. To avoid incurring
damaging costs to NATO's credibility and its deterrent powers, the
allies should refine their cyber policy, now. We live in an age in which
more people have access to highly sophisticated technologies and almost
every social, economic or military asset has become 'securitized' or
vulnerable to disruption -- whether temporary or more lasting -- from an
outside attacker or even an inside source.

How likely is it that the requested cyber effect will be delivered? The
answer to this question is not clear, in respect of either its
preparation or its execution. This is not only because IT
vulnerabilities are constantly discovered and patched; it is also
because of the difficulty of assessing the effects and possible
side-effects of an exploit when navigating and analysing complex IT
infrastructures. In other words, **[reconnaissance is difficult in
cyberspace, and so is the containment of effects. The Russian attempt to
use ransomware aimed at disrupting critical Ukrainian infrastructure in
2017, for example, succeeded---but simultaneously encrypted computers
globally, causing substantial economic damage to multinational
businesses]{.underline}** such as Maersk and FedEx.34 **[Collateral
damage and unintended consequences are serious issues for NATO. The
alliance takes pride in its adherence to the principles laid out in
international law, such as proportionality and
discrimination]{.underline}**, as former NATO Deputy Assistant
Secretary-General Jamie Shea has emphasized.35 Thus, **[disruptions of
servers with huge negative implications for civilians, or the use of
generic cyber tools that risk spreading their effects far and wide, are
most likely not going to be considered for use in NATO
operations.]{.underline}** Indeed, one of the main challenges to US
efforts to disrupt servers in working against ISIS was finding ways to
ensure that civilians were not hit by their cyber effects.36 **[Another
aspect of the difficulty of assessing the cyber effect relates to
adversaries' cyber defence efforts. For the more sophisticated players
in cyberspace, cyber defence has developed into more than simply
patching, clearing and updating systems. Cyber defence is also
increasingly about following an intruder's activity in one's own network
and creating 'honeypots' or 'honeynets'; or about following data traffic
back to the intruder's network.]{.underline}** In short, **[cyber
defence is also about deception and active defence]{.underline}**.37
This approach to cyber defence offers valuable insights into the
intruder's techniques and strategies; but the mere knowledge that
deception is becoming a predominant defensive strategy also introduces
doubts into the intruder's assessment of possible effects. Consequently,
as **[Russia is considered a peer competitor with considerable
cyber-defensive capacities, one informant expressed scepticism about the
extent to which smaller member states are confident in their ability to
deliver a cyber effect when it is requested by NATO]{.underline}**.38
**[This is especially the case if operational success depends on a
specific effect. Even if a state has developed the appropriate exploit,
it must also be able to verify that the effect is achieved and ensure
that the effect is contained to minimize collateral
damage]{.underline}**. And even if **[a state]{.underline}** is
confident about its current ability to contain and verify an effect, it
**[must also be confident that it can deliver, verify and contain the
effect]{.underline}** at the specific time in the future when CYOC
requests it. **[The process of integration is further complicated by the
fact that NATO must be willing to hand over to contributing states the
responsibility for making battle damage assessments and collateral
damage estimations]{.underline}**. As the following subsection shows,
**[states are generally unwilling to share classified information about
exploits]{.underline}**. Hence, **[the delegated NATO commander is
unlikely to receive much useful information about how cyber effects are
delivered before a decision about their deployment must be
taken.]{.underline}** As commanders would prefer to have control over
the capabilities used, member-state cyber effects are likely choices of
method only if alternative, conventional effects are unavailable.

The third **[challenge to the integration of cyber effects in NATO
operations relates to]{.underline}** a well-known military concept,
**[deconfliction]{.underline}**. **[The coordination by allies and
military units of their efforts to avoid confliction, between for
example an air operation and a special forces operation in the same
area, is a central element in every military campaign]{.underline}**.
Deconfliction is all about openness and communication between allied
partners. But **[in cyberspace, deconfliction comes with several
difficulties.]{.underline}** At the core of these difficulties is the
fact that **[the tools and techniques that produce cyber
effects]{.underline}**---which are often also used and heavily depended
on for intelligence collection---**[are developed in secret and must
stay secret until the effect is achieved. If the IT vulnerabilities and
exploits are known, vendors or adversaries can fix or replace the
software and thereby render the effect impossible to
achieve]{.underline}**.39 In an alliance not known for sufficient mutual
trust among members to share intelligence,40 **[there is little
indication that allies will become more open about the cyber tools and
techniques they currently have at their disposal]{.underline}**. The
request-based model is the result of that lack of trust. And **[the
unwillingness to share cyber intelligence seriously challenges NATO's
ambition to]{.underline}** use CYOC to **[facilitate information-sharing
to increase situational awareness and thereby achieve the 'cyber
readiness' and 'cyber resiliency']{.underline}** that NATO Deputy
Secretary-General Mircea Geoană hopes to attain.41 Furthermore, **[lack
of coordination and discussion about the use of military cyber
capabilities,]{.underline}** both internally in each state and among
allies, **[can have negative implications for intelligence activities
and general network security]{.underline}**. A **[conventional military
decision to deliver cyber effects is rarely concerned with maintaining
access and staying secret after an effect is achieved]{.underline}**.
Even though it is customary to try to obscure the vulnerabilities that
are being exploited, it is difficult to ensure that those operating the
targeted system or third-party network analysts do not identify and fix
the vulnerabilities in, for example, commercial products used all over
the world. Thus, **[military plans to engage other state entities need
to weigh the benefit of delivering cyber effects against the risk of
losing intelligence capacity, as well as the risk that other actors
(allies, corporations, adversaries, criminals, etc.) will use the same
exploits against oneself.]{.underline}** In other words, **[there is a
conflict of interest between attack, intelligence collection and
internal defence in each NATO member state]{.underline}**.42 The desire
of the US Cyber Command to become more independent from the National
Security Agency (NSA) is precisely an attempt to gain a stronger voice
when the US government assesses whether a vulnerability should be
disclosed to vendors, retained for intelligence purposes or used to
deliver 'loud' cyber effects.43 **[The risk of confliction among allies
arises from the fact that a similar assessment procedure does not exist
across NATO]{.underline}**. As conversations with several national
representatives at the CDC reveal, such a procedure is unlikely to be
agreed upon owing to the different perspectives on offence, defence and
espionage in cyberspace currently prevailing among member states.44
**[If the Netherlands, for example, offers to deliver a 'loud' cyber
effect in a NATO operation, British or American intelligence operations
could end up being disturbed because they rely on the same
vulnerabilities which---when used in military operations---risk being
exposed and subsequently fixed.]{.underline}**45 When deploying 'loud'
cyber effects, **[malicious actors such as criminals are also given the
opportunity to identify and exploit the same vulnerabilities in
unpatched systems in allied countries.]{.underline}** The ransomware
incidents known as **[WannaCry and NotPetya are examples of the damage
that can emerge from government exploits becoming publicly
available]{.underline}**---even though the specific vulnerabilities were
already patched by Microsoft and updates released to supported
systems.46 In short, **[there is a dilemma]{.underline}** both
internally, between intelligence agencies and the military, and
externally, **[between allies]{.underline}**. While it is difficult to
do much about the latter, **[the internal power dynamics in most states,
with the intelligence agencies as the primary cyber actors, are likely
to limit the willingness of most states to deliver military cyber
effects---whether offensive or defensive---when CYOC makes
requests]{.underline}**. **[They also limit the willingness to share
cyber threat information across the alliance through
CYOC.]{.underline}** This section has pointed to three characteristics
about cyberspace that limit the integration of cyber effects in NATO
operations. **[In a complex and constantly changing cyberspace, it
continues to be difficult to develop and maintain sophisticated exploits
for targeted cyber effects. This is especially the case if the cyber
effects are requested for a specific time and place in order to
guarantee operational success, and if they simultaneously have to be
verifiable and conform to international legal principles]{.underline}**.
Neither the member states, which face an internal dilemma between
attack, intelligence collection and defence in cyberspace, nor the NATO
commander, who will prefer to control the capabilities used, are likely
to feel sufficiently confident about the targeted or highly integrated
cyber effects to choose that option if other capabilities are available.

establish memoranda of understanding on offensive cyber effects
operations in systems or networks based in allied territory. Objectives
of Out-of-Network Operations in Allied Networks Allied states may
operate in each other's systems or networks in at least three ways: as
an observer, gathering intelligence on adversarial activity in others'
networks; as a passerby, transiting through allied systems and networks
to access a certain adversarial target; or as a disrupter, seeking to
cause friction for an adversary's operation within an ally's network or
system**[. The German case discussed above is the only publicly known
case of a state acting as a disrupter in an allied network. But we can
expect that more of these cases will be publicly disclosed in the
future.]{.underline}** It has now been widely discussed that the U.S.
Cyber Command has undergone a significant shift in strategic thinking
away from deterrence toward persistent engagement and defend forward.
Following these recent changes in strategic thinking, U**[.S. Cyber
Command seeks to cause friction "wherever the adversary maneuvers,"
operating "globally, continuously and seamlessly."]{.underline}** In a
similar vein, NSA director and Cyber Command head Gen. Paul Nakasone
writes in an article for Joint Force Quarterly: "We must ... maneuver
seamlessly across the interconnected battlespace, globally, as close as
possible to adversaries and their operations, and continuously shape the
battlespace **[to create operational advantage for us while denying the
same to our adversaries."]{.underline}** While one may expect
adversaries to maneuver in allied networks, t**[he U.S.]{.underline}**
is currently the only NATO state **[that makes causing friction in
allied networks a necessary and explicit component of its strategy.
Other military cyber organizations could follow in the near
future]{.underline}**. And we already see countries moving in this
direction. On Aug. 1, the Communications Security Establishment Act
(CSE) came into force in Canada. According to the Canadian government,
"CSE could be authorized to proactively stop or impede foreign cyber
threats before they damage Canadian systems or information holdings, and
conduct online operations to advance national objectives." The Canadian
government does not explicitly talk in its latest strategy about the
need to operate "globally, continuously and seamlessly" or to cause
friction "wherever the adversary maneuvers." In that regard, it needs to
do more strategic thinking---as other countries do---on the exact role
of cyber operations on allied networks in the military context. But the
proposed memorandum of understanding on cyber offense addresses exactly
this possibility.

**[In considering cooperation and burden-sharing]{.underline}**, Allies
face several dilemmas depending on their ambitions and resources for
both cyberspace and MDO. **[The US must]{.underline}** overcome domestic
inter-service rivalries and **[decide how to integrate
partners]{.underline}**, **[including whether it can accept a
multinational vision of MDO that is not imposed on smaller allies---or
excludes them entirely, at NATO's expense]{.underline}**---**[but rather
is genuinely collaborative]{.underline}** (Watling & Roper, 2019).
**[Larger European nations face]{.underline}** the dilemma of **[whether
to buy into a US-led architecture]{.underline}** and system-of-systems
with implications for freedom of action, data-sharing and procurement
choices, **[or shoulder the costs of sovereign or multinational
alternatives]{.underline}**.11 They also face choices over how best to
contribute to multinational MDO: whether to aspire to full-spectrum
capabilities to allow sovereign action and offer redundancy to Allies'
capabilities or to specialise in certain domains (e.g. cyber) to offer
niche capability and buy leverage with the US and NATO by making
themselves indispensable. **[Smaller nations must decide how to
influence larger Allies and NATO, and what to do if they lack cyber
capabilities]{.underline}** (or others deemed central to MDO, e.g.
long-range fires) or their forces are too small to operate or gain MDO
experience at echelons above brigade (Watling & Roper, 2019). **[[The
economic fallout of COVID-19]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[raises
renewed questions about affordability]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[and the
extent to which Allies are willing and able to invest in new cyber
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**---though some may see these as
cost-efficient alternatives to land, air or maritime forces---**[[and
how they time investments in ambitious transformation programmes such as
MDO]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Clark, 2020). Timing presents both threats
and opportunities from a cyber perspective. **[[Rapid, hasty
transformation risks undermining NATO cohesion]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[and interoperability]{.underline}]{.mark}** or creating
vulnerabilities in JADC2 systems with immature cyber defences (Donaldson
& Sciarini, 2019b). Conversely, overly cautious change risks ceding
ground to adversaries such as Russia and China which are investing
heavily in asymmetric means, including offensive cyber capabilities, to
gain an information advantage over NATO (Kilcullen, 2020).

**[Policy differences exacerbate conceptual ones]{.underline}**.
**[Allies differ in their policy and legal constraints, strategic
cultures, threat perception, resources, planning and budgetary cycles
and forces]{.underline}** (Sondhaus, 2006). While solidarity ultimately
remains NATO's strongest asset, **[these differences create seams that
adversaries can exploit]{.underline}**. **[This is especially so with
cyberspace]{.underline}**, **[where there is more
sensitivity]{.underline}** **[and less commonality to emerging national
approaches than in more established domains, and to MDO, which is
inherently predicated on integration and interoperability]{.underline}**
(Sharpy, 2020). **[Information sharing is especially problematic for the
cyber dimension of MDO]{.underline}**, **[with Allies reticent to share
details]{.underline}** **[of their capabilities across NATO given
security concerns and political sensitivities]{.underline}**. **[The
issue of permissions is also a 'significant challenge in the development
of cyber capabilities', especially where reconnaissance on Allied soil
and networks is required to detect hostile cyber activity]{.underline}**
(Watling & Roper, 2019). **[Nations also have differing policy, legal
and ethical stances on key technologies on which MDO
relies]{.underline}**. **[This includes the use of offensive cyber
capabilities or basing of hypersonic missiles or longrange penetrating
fires in Europe]{.underline}**, which some fear could be destabilising
and escalatory (Quintin & Vanholme, 2020). **[NATO similarly lacks a
common approach to governance and use of AI, autonomy and
automation]{.underline}**, all envisaged as essential enablers for JADC2
(Williams, 2020). This affects the levels of autonomy (with the human
in, on or out of the loop) used for sensor data fusion and
decision-making, or to deliver effects using uncrewed platforms,
automated cyber systems and human-machine teaming (Scharre, 2018).

#### Private Sector

//um-ef)

Problematically, authorities associated with using cyber capabilities
are typically held at the strategic and national level; how tactical or
operational commanders might call upon cyber means as part of future MDO
remains unclear (Nettis, 2020). **[Responsibilities for cyberspace also
often fall at least partly to civilian agencies]{.underline}**,
**[adding the complexity of cross-government cooperation]{.underline}**.
**[The private sector's role developing and applying technologies in the
cyber domain]{.underline}** (and, increasingly, space) also
**[necessitates that NATO work more closely with industry, academia and
others than for land, maritime or air operations]{.underline}** (Ablon
et al., 2019). **[This presents operational, policy and legal
difficulties]{.underline}** for C2, and cybersecurity challenges
associated with reliance on industry-owned networks, though Allies
continue to evolve novel mechanisms for partnering with industry to
address cyber threats (Carr, 2016).

**[There is also the question of tempo]{.underline}**: **[how to
synchronise operations]{.underline}** **[in cyberspace]{.underline}**
with the delivery of effects in other domains (Reilly, 2020). **[Though
cyber attacks might initiate in a moment, the underlying tools and
exploits may take years to develop]{.underline}** and the lead times and
scale of their eventual effect may be difficult to predict or measure
given the difficulties with battle damage assessment in cyberspace or
the EMS (Patrikarakos, 2017; US Joint Staff, 2019). **[Similarly,
commanders may lack awareness or understanding of available cyber
instruments and their limitations and effects compared to more familiar
weapons in the physical domains, limiting inclusion in joint planning
and decision-making]{.underline}** (Carbonell, 2017).

**[NATO has frequently been beset by intra-alliance tensions and in the
cyber security arena there]{.underline}** appears to be at least **[some
evidence of a divergence in European and US policy
approaches]{.underline}**. Recent **[revelations by]{.underline}**
former NSA contractor, Edward **[Snowden,]{.underline}** for example,
h**[ave exposed transatlantic tensions around
surveillance]{.underline}**, and the alleged NSA hacking of Chancellor
Angela Merkel's cell phone, which led to an angry phone call between
Obama and Merkel and the summoning of the US Ambassador to Germany, was
a major embarrassment for the US government (Wilder 2013). **[The US has
arguably taken a harder security stance on cyber issues since 9/11
because of its desire to protect the US homeland, and because it faces
increased strategic rivalry from rival global power
centre]{.underline}**s. A more **[aggressive cyber posture
can]{.underline}** certainly **[be seen in the establishment of the US
Cyber Command]{.underline}**, a unified and expanding military command
structure tasked with coordinating defensive and offensive cyber
operations for all branches of the US military, the deployment of the
Stuxnet software against Iranian nuclear centrifuges, the Patriot Act,
and the mass surveillance programmes run by the NSA, including the Prism
programme**[. The use of offensive and even pre-emptive operations by
the US government has also grown in recent years, with a high number of
ICT specialists employed]{.underline}** to penetrate foreign networks
(Gellman and Nakashima 2013). In 2012, Obama signed Presidential
Decision Directive 20, a classified document that gave the US military
the authority to conduct more aggressive cyber operations to thwart
cyber attacks against US systems (Nakashima 2012). **[The wealth of
cyber resources and capabilities that exist within the US military and
associated agencies may be a reason in and of itself why the US approach
to managing cyber conflict has been dominated by that branch of the US
government.]{.underline}** Mary O Connell takes up this line of
argument, suggesting that the **[US government has become "trapped in an
ideology of militarism"]{.underline}** (O'Connell 2012, p. 191) and
claiming that "the US military today has the largest concentration of
expertise and legal authority with respect to cyberspace" (O'Connell
2012, p. 187). She further notes that in 2009, following the Estonia
attacks, the Russia Georgia war and the release of the Stuxnet virus,
t**[he US government "began releasing a number of policies on cyber
security that were predominantly military in orientation]{.underline}**"
(O'Connell 2012, p. 188). This would seem to support the line of
argument advanced by this article, that threats from state rather than
non-state actors explain the elevation of cyber security as an issue
within the transatlantic security community. **[This hard power approach
to cyber security in the US c]{.underline}**ould also be explained by
the rhetoric being used to describe cyber attacks in the American
context. Former Defence Secretary Leon Panetta's claim that the US could
face a "cyber Pearl Harbour" is a prime example of the securitisation
and militarisation of cyber discourse. When there is a propensity at the
highest levels of government to adopt Second World War and cold war
analogies to characterise cyber conflict, this can shape US policy and
doctrine in a certain direction. Shachtman and Singer (2011) argue that
clear links can be found between cold war strategic thinking and the
formulation of current US policy, especially the idea that cyber attacks
might be met with conventional attacks; an idea "lifted" from the 1960s
strategy of flexible response. Commercial and political motives might
also have led to the US taking a more military-based approach to cyber
security issues. They further argue that "there is a massive amount of
threat inflation going on in Washington's discussion of online dangers,
most frequently by those with political or profit motives in hyping the
threats" Shachtman and Singer (2011). While we should be careful in
suggesting that **[a new "cyber industrial complex" is forming in
America]{.underline}**, the huge US government spending on cyber
protection for the federal government, such as a \$1 billion contract
awarded to Raytheon by the Department for Homeland Security in 2015, may
create incentives for responses to cyber security threats to be
militarised. Equally, threat inflation may displace attention from the
arguably more pervasive problem of cyber crime. **[In
Europe]{.underline}**, at least on the surface, **[a softer cyber
security approach is evident. EU responses to cyber security have
typically emphasised criminal and civil procedures for dealing with
cyber attacks,]{.underline}** reflecting a European **[preference for
soft power over hard power, and there has been a broader reluctance in
Europe to militarise cyberspace.]{.underline}** The new **[European
Union Cyber Security Strategy]{.underline}**, for example, **[is based
on promoting norms in cyberspace,]{.underline}** encouraging dialogue
between nations, **[enhancing technical capacity and
resilience]{.underline}**, and fighting cybercrime (Ashton 2013). The
most controversial aspect has been the requirement for businesses in
Europe, and particularly critical infrastructure providers, to report
cyber attacks to a central authority. Overall though, **[the strategy is
defensively orientated and non-militaristic.]{.underline}**

**[One]{.underline}** way to explain this is through the existence and
dominance of a largely **[unspoken but widely [accepted
norm]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For decades, **[the [predominant actors in
cyberspace]{.mark} have been [intelligence agencies]{.mark}; and the
norms that characterize interactions between intelligence agencies are
not primarily concerned with military concepts such as conflict
escalation and deterrence]{.underline}**.67 In the world of intelligence
agencies, success is not about keeping a distance between oneself and
the adversary by signalling one's intentions and capabilities. It is
about being able to outmanoeuvre adversaries in a space of constant
contact.68 There are always risks, and **[the work usually takes place
in legal grey zones where a clear distinction between war and peace is
not the guiding principle]{.underline}**. This is an arena where the
opportunity to annoy, cheat and delay opponents is taken when it arises.
In short, espionage and counter-espionage do not fit well with the
thorough military operational planning that characterizes NATO
operations. **[Intelligence operations]{.underline}**, on the other
hand, **[fit perfectly with a dynamic cyberspace where anonymity is easy
to achieve and uncertainty a constant condition]{.underline}**.69 The
states that embrace cyberspace as a domain where the intelligence norm
dominates are able to use a broader array of tools to pursue or respond
to various foreign political objectives than only those that relate to
military operations. In its 2018 'vision', the US Cyber Command built
implicitly on the dominant intelligence norm. Here, the objective is to
become more agile and act as close to the adversary as possible ('defend
forward').70 The United States considers 'constant contact' and
'persistent engagement' as the necessary guiding principles to achieve
superiority in cyberspace and to take full advantage of the broader
potential for pursuing its political objectives through cyberspace.
During the 2018 US midterm elections, for example, the US Cyber Command
worked closely with the NSA to disrupt servers operated by the Russian
Internet Research Agency aiming to spread fake news and stir up tension
in the United States.71 More recently, the US Cyber Command responded
with various cyber effects against Iran after the Iranian Revolutionary
Guards apparently placed mines on ships in the Strait of Hormuz.72 These
practices illustrate that, for the United States, cyber effects provide
political options when one does not want to escalate existing tensions
into military confrontation. Defensive coordination between allies
through CYOC supports such defensive use of cyber effects, increasing
the possibility that US Cyber Command will be allowed to 'defend
forward' and work persistently through allied networks.73 **[[A more
cyber-active NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, **[[risks being
counterproductive]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[to the ambition to 'defend
forward' through allied networks. [Unintended conflict escalation
from]{.mark} ongoing [cyber activity is mainly a risk if military
analysts]{.mark}---in a strategic environment with heightened attention
to military confrontation---[ignore the dominant intelligence
norm]{.mark}]{.underline}**. If that happens, **[it becomes more likely
that ['persistent engagement' and active cyber defence will be
misinterpreted as military preparation, armament or the initial phase of
an attack]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[If NATO]{.mark}, an organization
that has publicly returned to its original raison d'être of deterrence
and collective defence, [becomes the entity that coordinates cyber
effects]{.mark} below the threshold of armed conflict, then [the
likelihood increases that Russia misinterprets these effects as
escalatory and acts accordingly]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In other words,
**[[a more active NATO]{.mark} in the current strategic environment
[increases]{.mark} the [risk that]{.mark} the existing [intelligence
norm will be undermined and replaced by a more militarized
norm]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

guidelines for]{.underline}** the operational **[use of AI-enabled
systems]{.underline}**. Another challenge for NATO is to standardise
rules for all member states in dealing with AI-enabled autonomous weapon
systems. Countries like Turkey are working on autonomous weapons and
have developed AI-enabled loitering munitions. Turkey has requested the
US for upgraded F-16 fighter jets that are said to be AI-enabled.25 The
Biden Administration has asked the Congress to approve the upgrade of
Turkey's F-16 fighter jet fleet.26 Turkey's armed drones have also been
used in the Ukraine conflict. For smooth functioning of such systems, it
will be necessary for all NATO members to have standardised rules when
it comes to deployment of such systems. Also, **[there is no transparent
allocation of roles for different NATO bodies]{.underline}**, **[and "no
dedicated line of funding" for its AI strategy]{.underline}**.27 **[The
finances are shared through multiple funding like NATO Innovation Fund
and DIANA which manages funding for various other projects leading to
uncertainty over availability of funds and budget cuts]{.underline}**.
**[This will be a significant challenge for the effective implementation
of the AI strategy]{.underline}**.28 Some other challenges with the
adoption of AI strategy through innovation include fragmented national
innovation initiatives, allied technological categorisation and
digitisation gaps, speed of adoption and spending levels and the
underuse of NATO's mechanisms to undertake collaborative defence
innovation.29

More broadly, this chapter illustrates that regional and
**[international organizations have high stakes for military AI
governance]{.underline}**. As development, procurement, and
implementation of AI is accelerating, it is imperative that
international organizations facilitate cooperation among states and
industry partners to guide responsible military AI implementation
aligned with core values and legal obligations. The convening and
coordinating power of international organizations, among other
governance tools, is a necessary step for state cooperation and policy
alignment. How exactly NATO interacts with other international
organizations in the security architecture, including the UN and EU, is
a political topic that will also have important implications for the
composition of international technology governance regimes, and is a
subject for further research. On that note **[NATO]{.underline}**, or
any other international organization, **[is not exempt
from]{.underline}** these **[political hurdles]{.underline}**. **[As
EDTs increasingly become a focal point in the geopolitical space, any
approach of AI governance]{.underline}** in the international security
environment **[will have global political undertones]{.underline}**.
**[This will undoubtedly be a significant hurdle for NATO as it balances
responsible AI development and Allied coordination and
cooperation]{.underline}** in a changing geopolitical landscape. And
certainly, **[the political realities may well represent the greatest
challenge and disincentivize NATO to emerge as a leader in responsible
military AI]{.underline}**. Nevertheless, the three pillars indicate
that NATO is an institution with considerable opportunity to shape
responsible AI governance. More specifically, this entails urging and
facilitating Allied standards and policies to establish foundations for
emerging military technology built on informed and ethical principles
and enhance the international security environment.

### Links \-\-- AI Governance

#### AI governance causes massive infighting within the alliance -- divergent priorities between allies makes cohesion impossible and hampers NATO efficacy.

**Heikkila '21** \-- (Melissa Heikkilä, 3-29-2021, \"NATO wants to set
AI standards. If only its members agreed on the basics.,\" POLITICO,
https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-ai-artificial-intelligence-standards-priorities/,
accessed 6-19-2022) \-- nikki

**[On paper, NATO is the ideal organization to go about setting
standards for military applications of artificial intelligence. But the
widely divergent priorities and budgets of its 30 members could get in
the way.]{.underline}** The Western military alliance has identified
artificial intelligence as a key technology needed to maintain an edge
over adversaries, and it wants to lead the way in establishing common
ground rules for its use. "We need each other more than ever. No country
alone or no continent alone can compete in this era of great power
competition," NATO Deputy Secretary-General Mircea Geoană, the
alliance's second in command, said in an interview with POLITICO. **[The
standard-setting effort comes as China is pressing ahead with AI
applications in the military largely free of democratic
oversigh]{.underline}**t. David van Weel, NATO's assistant secretary
general for emerging security challenges, said Beijing\'s lack of
concern with the tech\'s ethical implications has sped along the
integration of AI into the military apparatus. \"I\'m \... not sure that
they\'re having the same debates on principles of responsible use or
they\'re definitely not applying our democratic values to these
technologies," he said. Meanwhile, the EU --- which has pledged to roll
out the world\'s first binding rules on AI in coming weeks --- is
seeking closer collaboration with Washington to oversee emerging
technologies, including artificial intelligence. But those e**[fforts
have been slow in getting off the ground. F]{.underline}**or Geoană,
that collaboration will happen at NATO, which is working closely with
the European Union as it prepares AI regulation focusing on "high risk"
applications. The **[pitch NATO does not regulate, but "once NATO sets a
standard, it becomes in terms of defensive security the gold standard in
that respective field]{.underline}**," Geoană said. **[The alliance\'s
own AI strategy, to be released before the summer, will identify ways to
operate AI systems responsibly, identify military applications for the
technology, and provide a "platform for allies to test their AI to see
whether it\'s up to NATO standards]{.underline}**," van Weel said. The
strategy will also set ethical guidelines around how to govern AI
systems, for example by ensuring systems can be shut down by a human at
all times, and to maintain accountability by ensuring a human is
responsible for the actions of AI systems. "If an adversary would use
autonomous AI powered systems in a way that is not compatible with our
values and morals, it would still have defense implications because we
would need to defend and deter against those systems," van Weel said.
"We need to be aware of that and we need to flag legislators when we
feel that our restrictions are coming into the realm of \[being
detrimental to\] our defense and deterrence," he continued. Mission
impossible? **[The problem is that NATO\'s members are at very different
stages when it comes to thinking about AI in the military context. The
U.S., the world\'s biggest military spender, has prioritized the use of
AI in the defense realm. But in Europe, most countries --- France and
the Netherlands excepting --- barely mention the technology's defense
and military implications in their national AI
strategies.]{.underline}** "It's absolutely no surprise that the **[U.S.
had a military AI strategy before it has a national AI strategy,\" but
the Europeans \"did it exactly the other way around]{.underline}**,\"
said Ulrike Franke, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on
Foreign Relations, said: That **[echoes familiar transatlantic
differences]{.underline}** --- and previous U.S. President Donald
Trump\'s complaints --- **[over defense spending, but also highlights
the different approaches to AI regulation more broadly.]{.underline}**
The EU\'s AI strategy takes a cautious line, touting itself as
\"human-centric,\" focused on taming corporate excesses and keeping
citizens\' data safe. The U.S., which tends to be light on regulation
and keen on defense, sees things differently. **[There are also
divergences over what technologies the alliance ought to develop,
including lethal autonomous weapons systems --- often dubbed "killer
robots" --- programmed to identify and destroy targets without human
control. Powerful NATO members including France, the U.K., and the U.S.
have developed these technologies and oppose a treaty on these weapons,
while others like Belgium and Germany have expressed serious concerns
about the technology.]{.underline}** These weapons systems have also
faced fierce public opposition from civil society and human rights
groups, including from United Nations Secretary-General António
Guterres, who in 2018 called for a ban. Geoană said the alliance has
"retained autonomous weapon systems as part of the interests of NATO."
The group hopes that its upcoming recommendations will allow the ethical
use of the technology without "stifling innovation." Staying relevant
**[These issues threaten to hamper NATO\'s standard-setting
drive.]{.underline}** \"I think there's a certain danger that if NATO
doesn't take this on as a real challenge, that it may be marginalized by
other such efforts," Franke said. She pointed to the U.S.-led AI
Partnership for Defense, which consists of 13 countries from Europe and
Asia to collaborate on AI use in the military context --- a forum which
could supplant NATO as the standard-setting body. That could have
consequences for human rights, too. "NATO... is a great place to
responsibly think about how to harness the good parts of this technology
and how to prohibit the parts that would be catastrophic for
humanitarian law and human rights law, and people at the end of the
day," said Verity Coyle, a senior adviser at Amnesty International,
which is part of the Stop Killer Robots campaign. "Without oversight
mechanisms to ensure ethical standards and measures, which would
guarantee that this technology will operate under meaningful human
control" NATO's strategy could head into an "ethical vacuum," Coyle
said. Franke **[said it\'s better for the alliance to focus on the
basics,]{.underline}** like increased data sharing to develop and train
military AI and cooperating on using artificial intelligence in
logistics. "If NATO countries were to cooperate on that, that could
create good procedures and set precedents. And I think we should then
move on to the more controversial things such as autonomous weapons
systems," she said.

Ethical issues and responsible use **[There are several ethical
considerations for CBT that may transcend even AI in their
complexity]{.underline}**. First is the issue of personal agency. If CBT
is able to motivate, enable, and even control human decision making and
action, where does individual responsibility end? Are soldiers
responsible for their actions when under the influence of advanced CBT,
and under what conditions? Relatedly, **[how does the Alliance ensure
that there is sufficient consent for the use of CBT for individuals
tasked to use the technology?]{.underline}** These technologies can be
invasive, both physiologically and mentally, and have the potential to
cause harm, particularly as we do not fully understand their unintended
cognitive and biological consequences. In addition, **[significant
privacy concerns will be raised once these technologies can enter our
minds and see our most private thoughts and memories]{.underline}**.
What are the limits of such searches? **[And what are the protections
for physiological and cognitive data]{.underline}**, and who may store
and control their dissemination or cause their deletion? More generally,
**[what protections will we have against the potential of mind control,
cognitive erasure, and reprogramming? The Alliance's success with CBT
will depend upon well-designed principles and practices relating to
these ethical considerations, since the adoption and integration of
these technologies will be based on the consent and acceptance of Allied
governments and their societies at large]{.underline}**. As in the case
of AI, the Alliance and member governments will need to develop
principles of responsible use, addressing such issues as privacy,
consent, lawfulness, responsibility and governability.

[NATO needs to take a **hard look** at itself]{.underline}. Across
twenty-five indicators of [democracy]{.underline} rated by Freedom
House, the **[downward trend]{.underline}** among NATO allies over the
past decade [is **stark**]{.underline}.35 [Especially in **Central
Europe**]{.underline} but not exclusively, there are setbacks in the
media, the judiciary and the functioning of national democratic
institutions. The rate at which [democracy is declining in **Poland**,
**Hungary** and **Turkey**]{.underline} is particularly alarming. In
2017 and 2018, these three states' scores represented some of the
largest one-year declines in political rights and civil liberties of all
195 countries ranked by Freedom House.36 Poland---with the largest
category declines in the forty-year history of the survey---is close to
leaving the "consolidated democracy" category.37 Hungary is no longer
rated a consolidated democracy. Turkey, whose decline in freedom over
the last ten years represents the largest of any country in the world,
crossed the threshold from "free" to "not free."38

While less severe today, [nationalist **populism**
movements]{.underline} in other allies [represent a broader, more
diffuse threat to NATO and can **amplify other challenges** facing the
Alliance]{.underline}. The United States is not immune, with its Freedom
House rating declining in 2018 due to "Russian interference in the 2016
election, violations of basic ethical standards by the new
administration and a reduction in government transparency."39 While this
slippage in the U.S. is relatively recent and still minor in scale, it
nonetheless diminishes America's standing as a standard-bearer for
democracy and further erodes its leadership position within the
Alliance. Further, anti-democratic policies among allies open
vulnerabilities for interference by competitors outside the Alliance,
especially Russia that seeks to divide NATO and the EU politically using
hybrid tactics.40

The question for allies is what must the role of the Alliance be in
reinforcing its core values when they are under assault from within.
NATO is both a political and a military alliance. It is not enough to be
bound together by a commitment only to Article 5 collective defense. The
values in the Treaty and the adherence of NATO allies to those values is
fundamental for Alliance cohesion. That shared commitment to values in
turn makes credible the Article 5 commitment. The Washington Treaty is
binding for both its political and military commitments.41 Allies cannot
ignore the failure to abide by political commitments including values
and expect military commitments to be unaffected. In short, NATO allies
should not expect that they could violate democratic values without
consequences, while resting assured that NATO cohesion is intact and
other commitments in the Treaty will be upheld. The Treaty is not a menu
of options from which allies can select some obligations while ignoring
others.

The NATO Treaty has no provision for policing members that drift from
common political values, unlike the European Union Treaty's Chapter 7
that has been invoked recently toward several EU member states with some
success.42 While it would be impossible to achieve consensus to impose
penalties on wayward allies, given that the ally in question could veto
any penalties, a range of escalating political initiatives on the part
of the Secretary General and a coalition of the other allies could
assert pressure. As a start, the Secretary General should express
concern in his bilateral meetings with the anti-democratic governments,
with the support of key allies and in partnership with the European
Union. To increase awareness within the Alliance and among the public,
foreign ministers could review annually indicators of democracy for all
twenty-nine allies, perhaps prepared by an informal high-level group of
experts drawing on Freedom House data. The NATO Parliamentary Assembly
and coalitions of allies can amplify the message.43 To increase
pressure, NATO could suspend hosting of visits, official meetings and
even military exercises with these nations. In severe cases, NATO
infrastructure spending and even access to military schools and
information sharing could be affected. An indirect way to express
concern among allies is to increase the prominence of core democratic
values when considering NATO enlargement decisions in the future.44 None
of these steps is without political cost and risk, even if calibrated
carefully. But the costs and risks of the gradual erosion of Alliance
cohesion as member states drift from the founding values are even
greater. NATO cannot expect to remain coherent and relevant and able to
address the full range of challenges it faces, if it ignores the
internal drift from democracy within some member states. This drift is a
fundamental issue for the Alliance.45

Streamlining NATO Decision-Making

Finally, the challenges facing NATO today demand more flexibility in
executive decision-making. As a core principle in preserving NATO
cohesion, consensus decision-making must remain the basis for major NATO
actions.46 [The Treaty requirements for **consensus** on]{.underline}
collective defense decisions [(Article 5)]{.underline} and enlargement
decisions (Article 10) [remain sensible]{.underline}. Major policy
decisions like the Defense Investment Pledge or the creation of the Very
High Readiness Joint Task Force rapid reaction capabilities require
consensus. [But today with NATO **enlarged** to **twenty-nine** members
and facing increasingly **diverse** and **complex** challenges, it is
time to **consider**]{.underline} how other, more routine,
administrative decisions can be taken more efficiently. But this should
be a management function, not derogation from the consensus principle.

We recommend strengthening the Secretary General's role as the chief
executive of the Alliance with broader authority to carry out routine
business without seeking consensus among the twenty-nine members. For
example, the Secretary General should consult allies on matters such as
agendas and timings of Ministerial Council meetings, but not be required
to seek consensus agreement. Today the agenda and even the dates of a
Foreign Minister meeting or a NATO-Russia Council meeting can consume
hours of formal Council time seeking consensus at the ambassadorial
level, consuming headquarters' bandwidth and crowding out more
substantive and urgent topics, including many outlined in this paper.
Further, the Secretary General's flexibility on international staff
personnel changes and NATO budget matters should be increased. Today,
for example, the Secretary General is severely constrained from adapting
the Alliance to emerging challenges by making meaningful shifts in
personnel and budgetary resources.47 While nations will continue to want
a critical role in all these decisions, criteria should be developed
that will provide for more flexibility while ensuring that all allies
gain a fair share of opportunities and allocation of resources.

[A related problem is the tendency of]{.underline} some [allies to
**bring into** the Alliance **bilateral issues** that **impede
progress** on collective issues of the Alliance. As an example, an ally
might **hold up agreement** on the **entire** NATO]{.underline} military
exercise [program because of an **unrelated bilateral dispute** with a
**NATO partner**]{.underline} who wishes to participate in an
exercise.48 [This practice **erodes Alliance cohesion**]{.underline} and
should not be permitted. After appropriate consultation, we recommend
the Secretary General should have the authority to exclude such external
issues from consideration in the Alliance, even if it means moving
forward without full consensus.

It would, however, be erroneous to solely limit the analysis of
disagreements among NATO members to the actions of Turkey as the current
'problematic ally.' **[Even Western European Allies sometimes hold
positions that are incompatible with each other]{.underline}**. **[Key
disagreements pertain to threat perception and]{.underline}** hence
**[defense priorities]{.underline}** as well as to the likelihood of
continued US security guarantees. **[These disagreements]{.underline}**
run deep---sometimes so deep that they are not always visible at the
surface level of every-day policy issues. Yet, they **[clearly shape
positions]{.underline}**, as a closer look at the ongoing European
defense debate reveals. In past years, many important aspects of this
debate revolved around the notion of European strategic autonomy. Long
known and used in a French national context,14 the 2016 European Union
Global Strategy lifted "strategic autonomy" to the European level. The
document "nurtures the ambition of strategic autonomy for the European
Union," but does not provide a concise definition of the notion's
content or implication.15 The ensuing and There is No "Europe" 161 at
times heated debate among Europeans was not particularly enlightening at
the conceptual level and is today considered in need of being
"detoxified."16 Yet, the debate has offered many meta-level insights
into the various national approaches to European security and defense.
Two variables are key in this context: threat perception and assessments
of the likely future of US security guarantees for Europe. **[Threat
perception is an absolute classic in European defense debates: the
question of against what or whom Europe needs to be
defended]{.underline}**. **[Diverging threat perceptions translate into
different and even incompatible views on what policies the Alliance
should adopt regarding certain key issues]{.underline}**, notably in its
relationship with Russia as the single most important issue for
Euro-Atlantic security in the 21st century. Moreover, given that threat
perception requires translation into defense planning, **[this is also a
debate about allocating capabilities and defining priorities in light of
scarce resources]{.underline}**. Most important in the context of threat
perception is how Europeans should deal with Russia, notably in a wider
vision of Euro-Atlantic security. The second variable pertains to the
United States and its engagement in European security. Here, the key
question is that of the mid- and long-term reliability of US security
guarantees and the conclusions Europeans need to draw for their own
security cooperation, which, in turn, has ramifications for NATO.

tasks]{.underline}** (i.e. collective defense, crisis management and
cooperative security)**[?]{.underline}** **[How should NATO
balance]{.underline}** **[a renewed focus on]{.underline}** inter-state
threats and **[great power competitors]{.underline}** **[with the
ongoing relevance of transnational threats]{.underline}** and
challenges, like terrorism or the climate-security nexus? When thinking
about great power competition, **[how much emphasis should NATO put on
Russia's immediate threat to Europe]{.underline}**, as opposed to the
more systemic challenge represented by China's strategic rise? **[And
what should be the right balance between the military and non-military
aspects of great power competition?]{.underline}** The latter question
becomes particularly relevant **[in light of]{.underline}** the growing
salience of "hybrid" forms of warfare and **[emerging disruptive
technologies]{.underline}**, **[which compel the Alliance to emphasize
societal resilience at home and step up its efforts to innovate
tech]{.underline}**nologically. **[The war in Ukraine]{.underline}** --
and ongoing debates about how the Alliance can assist Ukraine while
strengthening deterrence in Eastern Europe -- **[have become important
topics in Strategic Concept discussions]{.underline}**. In a way, the
current war vindicates the view that we do indeed live in an
increasingly competitive world, and that inter-state threats are back.
On the other hand, the overt and direct nature of Russia's invasion
challenges some of the pervading assumptions about how future conflict
was likely to unfold in indirect and hybrid ways. Even though the
Strategic Concept is meant to inform long-term strategy, **[the salience
of the war in Ukraine]{.underline}** and the fact that it is likely to
reverberate for years to come, **[makes the crisis important when
developing the Concept]{.underline}**. That said, uncertainty as to the
fate of Russia's operations in Ukraine or how they may impinge on
Russia's power and strategic posture along the Eastern border of the
Alliance, mean that any reflection on NATO's strategy in the East will
need to go beyond the Strategic Concept. More broadly,
**[the]{.underline}** Strategic **[Concept must look
beyond]{.underline}** immediate challenges in **[Europe and take stock
of the broader shift in global power]{.underline}** from the
Euro-Atlantic to the Indo-Pacific. The Strategic Concept from a
historical perspective The current NATO Strategic Concept, adopted in
Lisbon in 2010, aims to strike a balance between the Alliance's
so-called three core tasks: collective defense, crisis management and
cooperative security. In many ways, the Lisbon Strategic Concept draws
on the previous one (adopted in Washington in 1999). It represents a
crystallisation of NATO's experience in the post-Cold War period, an era
characterised by Western military-technological supremacy, and the
seeming absence of peer competitors. In the immediate post-Cold War
period, the belief that former adversaries like Russia and even emerging
great powers like China could somehow be integrated in the rules-based
order was still widely held. This was a truly exceptional period. The
power surplus enjoyed by the United States and its allies gave the West
a free hand (both politically and militarily) to engage in ambitious
out-of-area endeavours, and leverage crisis management operations and
collective security initiatives to expand the remit of the so-called
open and rules-based international order, not only in the broader
Euro-Atlantic neighbourhood but also beyond. During the long-post Cold
War era, collective defense and deterrence took a back seat. Even though
they constituted the fundamentals of Euro-Atlantic security, they were
considered almost superfluous in light of Western military-technological
supremacy. Crisis management and collective security ruled the day. But
this world is gone and great power competition is back. That reality was
illustrated by Russia's annexations of South Ossetia, Abkhazia and
Crimea in 2008 and 2014, and even more starkly by its invasion of
Ukraine in February 2022. Also striking has been China's strategic rise
and growing assertiveness in East Asia and beyond. Peer competitors are
once again challenging security, and geopolitical and security
architecture in the important regions of Europe and East Asia, but also
the institutional and normative fabric that underpins the open,
rules-based international order. **[Adapting the Alliance
to]{.underline}** this **[new wave of great power
competition]{.underline}** **[is arguably the main
challenge]{.underline}** in the coming decade. Beyond Ukraine Since
NATO's birth in 1949 -- and potentially as far back as the industrial
revolution -- the Euro-Atlantic region has been the undisputable centre
of gravity of global politics. Developments in and around the
Euro-Atlantic region typically had a profound impact upon geopolitical
and strategic balances elsewhere. However, in today's and tomorrow's
worlds, the opposite is likely to be true. As the Indo-Pacific becomes
the center of gravity of global economic growth, military competition
and technological innovation, dynamics emanating from that region are
likely to have a growing impact on other regions, including the
Euro-Atlantic. Thus, the geopolitical and security architecture of the
Euro-Atlantic region is likely to be increasingly affected by exogenous
factors. In a world that no longer revolves around the Euro-Atlantic
region, and is increasingly defined by China's strategic rise and the
growing centrality of the Indo-Pacific region, the Alliance will need to
think more globally about security. To be sure, **[the Euro-Atlantic
region will remain NATO's direct referent]{.underline}**. However, the
future of that region -- and that of NATO itself -- will likely become
increasingly affected by broader geostrategic dynamics to a degree and
in ways that are unfamiliar to NATO and its member countries. NATO must
therefore adapt to a world in which the Euro-Atlantic region will remain
important, but will probably become a secondary theatre in world
politics, as well as in the context of US geostrategy. These changes
should push the Alliance to develop a more global approach to security.
Beyond the more specific question of whether NATO itself should act
globally (e.g., by developing a presence in the Indo-Pacific region),
the Allies ought to think more systematically about the main
communicating vessels between Euro-Atlantic security and broader
geostrategic dynamics, specifically the Indo-Pacific. Three stand out:
the global implications of China's rise; the evolution of the
Sino-Russian relationship; and America's need to prioritise between
Europe and Asia, and what that may mean for NATO, European security and
the longstanding debate about a transatlantic division of labour. The
war in Ukraine, and Allied efforts to assist Ukraine and to bolster
deterrence in the East, seem to have led to a revival of the
transatlantic relationship, and a renewed focus on Europe, including for
the United States. Yet contrary to what one may instinctively think, the
war in Ukraine is unlikely to alter the steady shift in the centre of
global strategy and politics -- or, for that matter, of US geostrategy
-- towards the Indo-Pacific region. Rather than halt a shift towards the
Indo-Pacific, the Ukraine crisis and the response to it so far, provide
a powerful illustration of how European geopolitical and security
dynamics are increasingly affected by extra-European ones. For one
thing, China- and Asia-centric considerations have featured prominently
in debates about how the United States should respond to Russia's
aggression in Europe. Some experts argue that the United States should
avoid getting bogged down in a European war -- lest this should distract
its attention from the Indo-Pacific. Others have contended that a strong
U.S. response will deter adversaries and reassure allies elsewhere,
notably in the Indo-Pacific. As long as the security of Europe and the
Indo-Pacific hinges largely on US power, and as long as these two
regions continue to exercise significant pressure on US defense
resources, their alliance and deterrence architectures will probably
remain intertwined. This underscores the importance of greater political
and military coordination between NATO and its key partners in the
Asia-Pacific, namely Japan, Australia, the Republic of Korea and New
Zealand. For another thing, it is also important that NATO and its
Asia-Pacific partners have a common picture on Russia and China, and how
their relationship may evolve. Without ignoring existing frictions, if
the Sino-Russia relationship remains broadly cooperative, attempts to
drive a wedge between them may prove challenging. The broader point,
however, is that whatever the United States and its European and
Asia-Pacific allies think they can do in relation to engaging Russia or
China, or manipulating their relationship, they must remain aligned.
Otherwise, there is a risk they may draw different conclusions about
either power's trajectory or how their relationship may evolve, and thus
frame their policies on the basis of different premises. This could
conceivably trigger competition between the United States and its
allies, and among NATO Allies themselves. Conclusion The war in Ukraine
has become an important aspect in the debate about NATO's forthcoming
Strategic Concept. Discussions on how to continue to assist Ukraine and
bolster deterrence along the Eastern part of the Alliance will no doubt
take center stage in Madrid in June. This is understandable: deterring a
war in Europe is what NATO was created for. In fact, when it comes to
the main questions informing the debate on the Strategic Concept - i.e.
the balance between the three core tasks; state vs. non-state threats;
military vs. non-military; Russia vs. China, etc. - the war in Ukraine
may make the pendulum swing closer to the former than many would have
anticipated just prior to the invasion. However, **[preparing the
Alliance for a context increasingly defined by great power competition
requires looking beyond the current crisis in Eastern Europe, and taking
stock of broader geo-strategic developments]{.underline}**. This is
particularly important in light of the decreasing centrality of the
Euro-Atlantic region in global strategic competition, and the fact that
security dynamics in and around Europe will be progressively affected by
extra-European developments. Critically, **[the Alliance will need to
develop a more global approach to security, and more specifically a
better understanding of geo-strategic developments in the Indo-Pacific
region, and their likely implications for Euro-Atlantic
security.]{.underline}**

**[The 2010 Strategic Concept displays all the signs of an Alliance
faced with a range of security challenges but no major
threats]{.underline}**. It was drafted and approved at a time when NATO
forces were heavily engaged in a war of choice in Afghanistan, and when
the vast majority of allies did not perceive Russia -- let alone China
-- as an adversary, but rather saw it as a potential strategic partner.
Certainly, some allies wanted NATO to 'come home' and focus its energies
on Europe, Russia and collective defence, but most
**[allies]{.underline}**, including the United States, **[preferred NATO
to be global in orientation and better prepared for crisis
management]{.underline}**. Thus, **[there was little consensus as to
what NATO's key strategic focus should be in an indeterminate security
environment]{.underline}**.7 **[Unsurprisingly]{.underline}**, **[the
Strategic Concept does not set any clear strategic
priorities]{.underline}**. **[It merely identifies three core
tasks]{.underline}**: collective defence, crisis management and
cooperative security. **[Collective defence is catalogued first, but
there are no indications that the order in which the tasks are listed is
meant to signify a hierarchy of priorities. Several new initiatives and
forward-looking schemes are introduced, yet the concept stops short of
giving precedence to any core task.]{.underline}** Likewise, **[the
potential threats, risks and challenges identified by the concept, most
of which are unconventional and transnational in nature, appear to be
listed in no particular order.]{.underline}** Tellingly, **[the concept
describes the security environment as being characterised by 'a broad
and evolving set of challenges' that include the proliferation of
nuclear weapons, technology-related trends and environmental
constraints]{.underline}**.8 **[The 2010 concept's ambiguity concerning
threats and strategic priorities predictably spills over into its (lack
of) military guidance]{.underline}**. Unlike the 1991 and 1999 Strategic
Concepts, **[the 2010 version does not include a detailed section on
'Guidelines for Defence' that lays out comprehensive directions for
military planners. I]{.underline}**t speaks in generic terms of new
defence initiatives and lists aspirations to develop future
capabilities, yet **[it is silent on concrete measures, desired military
effects and objectives]{.underline}**. Compared with its forerunners,
and particularly the Cold War concepts, the 2010 document is thus
extraordinarily political in character and oriented towards public
diplomacy, and by implication rather disconnected from the military side
of NATO. Any bridge linking the Alliance's political masters to its
military authorities, as previously established by the 'Guidelines for
Defence' in 1991 and 1999, is awkwardly missing.

**[NATO achieves its objectives by upscaling its readiness, response and
military capabilities to deter an adversary]{.underline}**. It aims at
maintaining military forces in the right place and time capable of
deterring or, if necessary, repelling an adversary. In this context,
**[NATO leaders, who are aware of the fact that unity is essential for
success, comply with the principles of "cohesion" and "coherence".
Hence, "cohesion" and "coherence" have become distinctive indicators of
NATO's current strategic concept]{.underline}**. According to the former
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, "**[the Alliance that
cannot ensure collective defence loses cohesion in achieving collective
security".]{.underline}** In order to clarify the principles that are
crucial for the implementation of the new strategy, it is necessary to
understand what "NATO's cohesion" and "NATO's coherence" mean.Footnote1
**[NATO's cohesion means a level of political and ideological unity as
well as solidarity between the members of the Pact]{.underline}**. It
mainly refers to the principles on which the Alliance is based. This is
**[particularly true of the Member States' commitment to collective
defence, threats and challenges facing the Alliance.]{.underline}**
**[NATO's coherence refers to consensus among the Member States in order
to guarantee the Alliance's capabilities and capacities necessary to
ensure the effective implementation of NATO's missions. It involves
strategic plans]{.underline}**, **[resource requirements, material
capabilities, operational procedures, command structures, the number of
soldiers and logistical infrastructure]{.underline}** (Hodges et al.
2019). The dynamics of events after 2014 as well as the emergence of new
international threats (e.g. ISIS, refugees, epidemics) has led to
increasing expenditures on security and collective defence (Grygiel and
Wess Mitchell 2014). This issue seems to be extremely important and
therefore still remains within the realm of discussions among the
politicians and bodies responsible for the state security. With time and
transformations in geopolitical and military situations in the world,
the requirements for the North Atlantic Pact have also changed, which
has inspired the authors to write this article.

### Internals \-\-- SC key to Ukraine

**Goldgeier and Moller 6/29**/22 \[James Goldgeier and Sara Bjerg

International Security and a former Eisenhower Fellow at the NATO
Defense College; "What to watch for at this week's NATO summit"; June

The United States is more deeply engaged in Europe than the Biden
administration intended --- and Putin's war has once again highlighted
America's role as the guarantor of European security. It wasn't supposed
to be this way: Washington's focus was supposed to be on China. And that
brings us to the original headliner of the Madrid summit: the Strategic
Concept.

At their December 2019 summit, NATO leaders mentioned China for the
first time in a summit declaration. The alliance's last Strategic
Concept, in 2010, didn't address China. In 2021, we and other analysts
had every expectation that the big item to look for at the gathering in
Madrid this week would be a detailed explanation of NATO's role in
countering the growing threat from China.

But **[responding to Russian aggression, deterring future potential
Russian military, political and cyberattacks on NATO members --- and
boosting the alliance's force posture to shore up NATO's eastern members
--- now take precedence]{.underline}**. In fact, Stoltenberg on Monday
announced NATO's high-readiness forces would grow from 40,000 to more
than 300,000, which means sizable numbers of U.S. troops will be heading
to Europe.

Although the Russia-Ukraine war is thus making the U.S. foreign policy
pivot toward the Indo-Pacific that much harder, expect to see some
language about China in the new Strategic Concept. One point to watch is
whether a proposed summit on the sidelines takes place among NATO's key
Indo-Pacific partners: Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.

**[As with any strategy document, of course, it's the implementation
that really matters. As NATO leaders gather in Madrid, one big question
is whether the alliance has the energy]{.underline}** not only to
continue for as long as necessary the broad-based support for Ukraine
but to tackle other key challenges as well.

**[But despite its clean bill of health and demonstrable unity, NATO
faces a thicket of thorny issues, and discussions in Madrid will only
just begin to address them. The war in Ukraine will, of course, dominate
the summit. The conversation is poised to focus on the easy part:
getting more arms to the frontlines. But NATO also needs to take up the
hard part: when and how to marry the flow of weapons to a diplomatic
strategy aimed at producing a cease-fire and follow-on negotiations over
territory. The urgency of making that pivot stems from the need not just
to end the death and destruction but to limit the war's economic
spillover, which could threaten the Atlantic alliance from within by
eroding solidarity and weakening the West's democratic foundations. The
conflict in Ukraine also puts on NATO's agenda a set of additional
challenges: managing the future of enlargement, channeling Europe's
growing geopolitical aspirations, and building a transatlantic
architecture that can accommodate the ever more complex and diverse
issues facing the West.]{.underline}**

Escalation: Can a NATO - Russia conflict be managed?

**[[Once]{.mark} a [conflict was under way, the "fog of war" and]{.mark}
rising [unpredictability would inevitably set]{.mark} in, complicating
the implementation of any]{.underline}** predetermined theories of
escalation, deescalation and inter-**[conflict management. The actual
dynamics of]{.underline}** a **[conflict]{.underline}** and the
perceptions of the stakes involved **[are extremely difficult to
predict. Simulations]{.underline}** and table-top exercises can
**[give]{.underline}** only **[limited insights]{.underline}** into the
actual decision-making processes and interactions.

Still, **[[Russian]{.mark} military [theorists]{.mark}]{.underline}**
and practitioners seem to **[[assume]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[a
[conflict]{.mark} with NATO [can be]{.mark} managed and
[controlled]{.mark} in a way that would bring it to a swift end
consistent with Russian aims. The [Russian theory]{.mark} of
victory]{.underline}** would **[seek to [exploit weak points in]{.mark}
an [Alliance]{.mark} war effort. Based on the conviction that
democracies are weak and]{.underline}** their leaders and populations
are **[risk-averse, [Russia]{.mark} may [assume]{.mark}
that]{.underline}** its **[[threats of]{.mark} horizontal or vertical
[escalation could be]{.mark}]{.underline}** particularly **[[effective.
It would]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[try to bring home the
notion]{.underline}** that **[it has much higher stakes in the
conflict]{.underline}** (regime survival) **[than]{.underline}** a
majority of the **[NATO members]{.underline}** involved,
**[and]{.underline}** thus **[will be ready to [push]{.mark} the
[boundaries]{.mark} of]{.underline}** the **[conflict further. It
would]{.underline}** most likely **[[try to]{.mark} test and
[exploit]{.mark} potential [divisions]{.mark} within the Alliance,
combining selective diplomacy and activation of its intelligence assets
in]{.underline}** some **[NATO states]{.underline}** with a degree of
selectivity in terms of targets of particular attacks.

**[[Any]{.mark} NATO-Russia [conflict would]{.mark} inevitably [have a
nuc]{.mark}lear [dimension]{.mark}. The role of nuclear weapons as a
tool [for escalation control]{.mark} for Russia has been]{.underline}**
thoroughly **[debated by experts, but when]{.underline}** and how
**[Russia might use]{.underline}** (and not merely showcase or activate)
**[nuclear weapons in a conflict remains an open question.
Beyond]{.underline}** catch phrases such as **["escalate to
de-escalate"]{.underline}** or "escalate to win" **[[there are a]{.mark}
wider [range of options for Russian]{.mark} nuclear weapon
[use]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example, **[[a single nuclear]{.mark}
warning [shot could be lethal]{.mark} or non-lethal. It could be
directed against a]{.underline}** purely **[military target or
a]{.underline}** military-**[civilian one. [Detonation could be]{.mark}
configured for an [EMP effect. A "false flag"]{.mark} attack
is]{.underline}** also **[conceivable. These options]{.underline}**
might be used to **[signal escalation and could significantly
[complicate]{.mark} NATO's [responses]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Neither NATO nor its member states have developed a similar theory of
victory. Public NATO documents stipulate the general goals for the
Alliance: defend against any armed attack and, as needed, restore the
full sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states. **[It is
less clear how far the Alliance would be willing to escalate the
conflict]{.underline}** to achieve these goals, **[and what
mechanisms]{.underline}** and means **[it would use while trying to
maintain]{.underline}** some degree of **[control]{.underline}** over
the conflict.

**[The goals]{.underline}** and methods **[of waging a [conflict]{.mark}
with Russia [would]{.mark}]{.underline}** probably **[[have to be
limited]{.mark} in order [to avoid]{.mark} a massive [nuclear
exchang]{.mark}e. Such limitations]{.underline}** would also involve
restrictions on striking back against targets on Russian territory. But
too narrow an approach **[could put too much restraint on NATO's
operations: the Russian regime's stability may]{.underline}** ultimately
**[need to be threatened]{.underline}** in order **[to force the
leadership into terminating the conflict]{.underline}**. NATO would thus
need to establish what a proportional self-defence response to Russian
actions would involve, and to what extent cyber operations or attacks
against military targets in quite different parts of Russia would be
useful as tools of escalation to signal NATO's resolve. Moreover,
individual NATO Allies, especially those directly affected by Russia's
actions, might pursue their individual strategies of escalation.

With regards to the nuclear dimension in NATO escalation plans, given
the stakes involved, this element would most likely be handled by the
three nuclear-weapon members of the Alliance, with the US taking the
lead. The existence of three independent centres of nuclear
decision-making could be exploited to complicate Russian planning and
introduce uncertainty into the Russian strategic calculus, but some
degree of "P3" dialogue and coordination would be beneficial. This
coordination would not necessarily focus on nuclear targeting, but
rather on designing coordinated operations to demonstrate resolve in
order to keep the conflict below the nuclear threshold, or bring it back
under the threshold after first use.

**[[Relying on]{.mark} concepts of [escalation
control]{.mark}]{.underline}** and on lessons **[from the Cold
War]{.underline}** confrontation **[[might be misleading]{.mark}. The
circumstances in which a [Russia-NATO conflict would]{.mark} play out
would [be]{.mark} radically different from the 20th
century]{.underline}** screenplay. Moreover, **[instead of
gradual]{.underline}** (linear) **[escalation or salami tactics
escalation, it is possible to imagine]{.underline}** surprizing
**[["leap frog" escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, possibly
**[connected]{.underline}** with actions **[in different
domains]{.underline}** (e.g. a cyberattack against critical
infrastructure). Flexibility, good intelligence and inventiveness in
responding to such developments would be crucial.

Conflict termination

**[Russian and NATO assumptions regarding conflict termination
would]{.underline}** most likely **[not survive the first hours
of]{.underline}** an **[actual conflict. [Both sides]{.mark} are capable
of [underestimat]{.mark}ing the [resolve]{.mark} of the other side to
prevail]{.underline}** in a conflict **[and the other side's willingness
to]{.underline}** commit the necessary resources and **[endure the
costs, especially once both]{.underline}** sides **[start
committing]{.underline}** their **[political capital]{.underline}** and
resources and the casualties accumulate.

**[The security and prosperity of the transatlantic community, including
the United States, rests on the foundation of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO). Russia's ongoing war of naked aggression against
Ukraine, a NATO non-member state, should put to rest any lingering
questions about the modern utility of the Alliance and about which
threat should be the focus of NATO's upcoming strategic
concept.]{.underline}** The answer is clear: **[The U.S. must lead the
Alliance to a wholesale refocusing on the organization's raison d'être
of collective defense]{.underline}**. While the Alliance faces
challenges emanating from an unstable Mediterranean basin and terrorism
originating from the Middle East, the fact remains that **[Russia
continues to be the only existential threat to member
states.]{.underline}** **[NATO must send a strong signal that it is
strengthening deterrence measures explicitly in response to the
increased threat from Russia. Deterrence measures should include an
Alliance-wide recommitment to defense spending; a persistent and
continuing U.S. presence in Eastern European member states; updated
Alliance operational planning in light of Russia's position in Belarus
and Ukraine; and an increase in U.S. air, ground, and naval forces in
the European theater as a sign of continued commitment to the NATO
treaty's Article 5.]{.underline}** These deterrence measures must be
carried out with the recognition that, from a long-term perspective,
China is the largest peer challenger from whom the U.S. must expect
hostile action. Any improvements to the U.S. force posture must not be
to the detriment of the nation's ability to counter China. The
Importance of NATO Deterrence Has Only Increased **[From the Arctic to
the Levant, Russia remains an aggressive and capable threat to NATO and
the interests of its members]{.underline}**. For member states in
Eastern Europe, **[Russia represents a real and potentially existential
threat.]{.underline}** **[Russia's]{.underline}** entrenched position in
Belarus, along with its **[ongoing actions to cleave Ukraine, a nation
that borders four NATO]{.underline}** members, in two, **[scramble the
geostrategic map of Europe and necessitate changes to NATO operational
planning, exemplifying the need for the Alliance to take swift and
resolute steps to bolster deterrence measures along its eastern
flank.]{.underline}** Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine will
hopefully be the push that some allies need to finally live up to their
commitments to the NATO defense spending benchmark. As an
intergovernmental security alliance, NATO is only as strong as its
member states. Weak defense spending on the continent has led to a
significant loss of capabilities and embarrassing gaps in readiness for
NATO allies. As a result, American Presidents of both political parties
have long called for increases in defense spending by NATO allies.
Although most are familiar with Article 5 of the North Atlantic
Treaty---an attack on one is an attack on all---Article 3 is the most
important when it comes to the overall health of the Alliance. Article 3
states that member states, at a minimum, will "maintain and develop
their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack." Only a
handful of NATO members can legitimately say that they are living up to
their Article 3 commitment. In 2006, in an effort to encourage defense
investment, NATO set a target for its 30 member states to spend 2
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on defense. At the 2014 Wales
Summit, member states recommitted to spending 2 percent of GDP on
defense and committed to spending 20 percent of their defense budgets on
"major equipment" purchases by 2024. **[NATO allies have made real and
sustained increases in defense spending in recent years, but it is far
from enough]{.underline}**. In 2021, 10 members of the Alliance spent 2
percent of GDP on defense, and 24 members met the 20 percent benchmark.1

**[standing up to a bully]{.underline}** **[with]{.underline}**
**[nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. Remember that **[MAD]{.underline}**
**[was about the balance of terror]{.underline}**: lose the balance and
all that remains is terror. Today, **[NATO]{.underline}** **[must
balance]{.underline}** **[Russian threats to use nukes with
a]{.underline}** **[commitment]{.underline}** **[to retaliate in
kind]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** **[meet Putin's
escalation]{.underline}** **[with]{.underline}** **[escalation of its
own]{.underline}**. **[In a MAD world]{.underline}**, **[caving in to
nuclear intimidation is a]{.underline}** **[sign of
weakness]{.underline}** **[that makes a war]{.underline}** **[more
likely]{.underline}**.

Furthermore, **[in case of any aggression]{.underline}**, **[the
response]{.underline}** **[must be total war]{.underline}**. The paradox
of Narva helps in understanding the calculus. Suppose that the Russian
army captured Narva, a small Estonian city bordering Russia. If NATO did
not respond to this attack on a member state, the Alliance would be
dead, and all countries without nuclear weapons, lacking a credible
deterrent against a nuclear strike, would be obvious targets of future
aggression.

**[A limited NATO response would mean that the aggressor
could]{.underline}** **[keep pushing boundaries]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[raising its demands]{.underline}**, just as
Hitler raised his demands in the name of peace. **[One
must]{.underline}** therefore **[conclude that the answer is to
go]{.underline}** "**[all in]{.underline}**," **[no matter how small
Russia's aggression is]{.underline}**. **[This also means that
NATO]{.underline}** **[must avoid]{.underline}** **[describing what it
will]{.underline}** **[not do in response to aggression]{.underline}**.
Instead, **[the Alliance must]{.underline}** **[credibly
signal]{.underline}** **[that]{.underline}** **[all options are on the
table]{.underline}**.

**[The prospect of a nuclear war is terrifying]{.underline}**. **[But it
is]{.underline}** equally if not **[more terrifying]{.underline}** **[to
think that a madman in the Kremlin]{.underline}** with nuclear weapons
**[can]{.underline}** **[beat into submission]{.underline}** **[whole
countries]{.underline}** **[or]{.underline}**
**[continents]{.underline}** **[by threatening to launch his arsenal
against]{.underline}** **[anybody]{.underline}** **[who meddles with his
ambitions]{.underline}**.

Today, **[when Ukraine is the target]{.underline}** **[of Putin's
delusional ambitions]{.underline}**, **[some]{.underline}** US
**[policymakers may ask why NATO should risk a nuclear confrontation
over a country that is not a member]{.underline}**. **[Putin
may]{.underline}** **[then threaten]{.underline}**
**[E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion
**[members]{.underline}** Finland or Sweden. But, again, the argument
goes, they are not in NATO, so why risk Armageddon? **[The day after
tomorrow]{.underline}**, **[the target may be Poland or
Germany]{.underline}** -- but at least they are not America.

**[W]{.underline}**orld **[W]{.underline}**ar **[II]{.underline}** **[is
a grim reminder that]{.underline}** "**[a quarrel in a faraway
country]{.underline}**, between people about whom we know nothing," as
Neville Chamberlain infamously described the Sudeten crisis,
**[can]{.underline}** **[quickly escalate]{.underline}** **[into
a]{.underline}** **[global conflagration]{.underline}**. But **[such
dangerous progressions are]{.underline}** **[not
inevitable]{.underline}**.

**[If Ukraine has the courage to]{.underline}** **[battle Russian

conditions]{.underline}**, **[the West]{.underline}**
**[must]{.underline}** **[find the nerve to stand up to Putin's nuclear

Seventy years after NATO's birth, **[[the Alliance is still confronting
an existential threat]{.mark} to its east]{.underline}**, several
defense and foreign affairs ministers said on December 3. Although
French President Emmanuel Macron has made waves by suggesting that
terrorism, not Russia, was the biggest threat facing NATO today, **[the
defense ministers from [Estonia and Lithuania]{.mark} were clear that
they still [see Moscow as their biggest]{.mark} challenge. "Russia has
shown with its actions that it is a serious [security
threat]{.mark},"]{.underline}** Estonian defense minister Jüri Luik said
during a panel discussion on Baltic and Black sea security during the
NATO engages event in London on December 3. "For Lithuania, \[Russia\]
is the only external existential threat we have," added Lithuanian
defense minister Raimundas Karoblis. While Macron has a legitimate
concern in preventing terrorism in Europe, Luik argued that unlike
terrorism, **["[Russia is the existential threat"]{.mark} because "it is
a nation state." [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**, he added, **[[is "the
only organization that can viably" deter Russian aggression against its
neighbors]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Both ministers praised NATO's efforts
to protect the Baltic states from Russian attack and show Moscow that
the Alliance would not leave them undefended. "Lithuania has never had
such a great number of guarantees and allies as we have now," Karoblis
said. Luik warned, however, that persistence is key to staving off
Russian aggression. "**[[If we are serious in our actions]{.mark}, if we
are clear and [concise in our messaging, then the threat is quite
low]{.mark}]{.underline}**," he explained. "**[But [if we are weak, if
we are wobbly, then the threat can go up]{.mark}]{.underline}**." Both
Karoblis and Luik suggested that NATO needs to do more to shore up its
Baltic defense, including larger exercises to show "how we bring in
additional troops if they are necessary," as Luik suggested. Karoblis
highlighted the need for "more precise defense planning," a wish that
has become controversial after a reported Turkish attempt to block new
military plans for the Baltics and Poland until NATO recognizes Syrian
Kurdish groups as terrorist organizations. Despite the supposed Turkish
opposition, neither Luik nor Karoblis were concerned that the proposed
plans would be blocked more than temporarily. "The discussions are going
on all the time," Luik explained, adding that "if we don't find a
compromise here, we hopefully will find it a bit later. But I am
absolutely sure we will find a compromise." Karoblis promised "we will
find a solution to this." Black Sea instability But **[while [the
Baltics may remain firmly in NATO's sights]{.mark}, Romania's defense
minister Nicolae Ciuca warned [that the Black Sea region,]{.mark} the
other vital part of the Alliance's eastern flank, [needs to be accounted
for]{.mark} as well.]{.underline}** "NATO and the EU need to have a very
coherent approach to the whole flank," rather than just tailoring
solutions to either the Baltics or the Black Sea, he argued. In the
latter especially, he continued, "we need to focus on strengthening the
NATO and EU presence and NATO and EU cooperation in order to support the
partnership countries," such as Georgia and Ukraine, who have both faced
invasion by Moscow in the last decade. "Whether you like it or not, we
defend your eastern flank," Ukrainian foreign minister Vadym Prystaiko
told the crowd in London, warning that the growing number of priorities
for NATO in the Baltics and the Southern flank are causing the region to
"believe that we are being left alone" despite being under daily
pressure from Moscow. Georgian foreign minister David Zalkaliani agreed
that the region must be one of importance for NATO because ["**[without
a secure Black Sea, there will be no security in the Euro Atlantic
security space.]{.underline}**"]{.mark} Zalkaliani particularly lamented
the failure of NATO leaders to approve the accession of either Ukraine
or Georgia to NATO despite pledging to do so at the 2008 NATO Summit.
Despite the prolonged wait, "Georgia is already acting like an ally,"
Zalkaliani explained, as his country has met the 2 percent of GDP
defense spending goal and has contributed troops to NATO missions in
Afghanistan and Europe. "When a country like Georgia delivers it has to
be reciprocated," he argued. Prystaiko agreed, noting that the
"indecisiveness" of NATO since the 2008 promise has given Moscow the
greenlight to attack both countries. **[Russian President Vladimir
[Putin,]{.mark} Prystaiko argued, [can only be deterred through the
strength of NATO. "He still appreciates and respects the mightiness of
the Alliance. That is actually the only language which Putin
understands."]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Breaking NATO causes Russian aggression that escalates to nuclear war

**Beauchamp 18** \[Zack, senior correspondent at Vox, where he covers
global politics and ideology, "How Trump is killing America's
alliances,"
6/12/18, <https://www.vox.com/world/2018/6/12/17448866/trump-south-korea-alliance-trudeau-g7>\] 

How **[the weakening of American alliances could lead to a massive
war. ]{.underline}**There has never, in human history, been an era as
peaceful as our own. This is a hard truth to appreciate, given the
horrible violence ongoing in places like Syria, Yemen, and Myanmar, yet
the evidence is quite clear. Take a look at this chart from the
University of Oxford's Max Roser. It tracks the number of years in a
given time period in which "great powers" --- meaning the militarily and
economically powerful countries at that time --- were at war with each
other over the course of the past 500 years. The decline is
unmistakable: \[\[TABLE OMITTED\]\] This data should give you some
appreciation for how unique, and potentially precarious, our historical
moment is. For more than 200 years, from 1500 to about 1750, major
European powers like Britain and France and Spain were warring
constantly. The frequency of conflict declined in the 19th and 20th
centuries, but the wars that did break out --- the Napoleonic conflicts,
both world wars --- were particularly devastating. The past 70 years
without great power war, a period scholars term "the Long Peace," is one
of history's most wonderful anomalies. The question then becomes: Why
did it happen? And could Trump mucking around with a pillar of the
global order, American alliances, put it in jeopardy? The answer to the
second question, ominously, appears to be yes. **[[There is significant
evidence that]{.mark} strong American alliances --- most notably the
NATO alliance and US agreements to defend Japan and South Korea ---
[have been instrumental in putting an end to great power war]{.mark}.
"[As this alliance system spreads and expands, it correlates with
t]{.mark}his dramatic decline, this unprecedented [drop, in
warfare]{.mark},"]{.underline}** says Michael Beckley, a professor of
international relations at Tufts University. "**[[It's a really, really
strong correlation."]{.mark} ]{.underline}**A 2010 study by Rice's Leeds
and the University of Kentucky's Jesse C. Johnson surveyed a large data
set on alliances between 1816 and 2000. They found that countries in
defensive alliances were 20 percent less likely to be involved in a
conflict, on average, than countries that weren't. **[[This holds true
even after you control for other factors that would affect the
likelihood of war]{.underline}]{.mark}**, like whether a country is a
democracy or whether it has an ongoing dispute with a powerful neighbor.
In a follow-up paper, Leeds and Johnson looked at the same data set to
see whether certain kinds of alliances were more effective at protecting
its members than others. Their conclusion is that alliances deter war
best when their members are militarily powerful and when enemies take
seriously the allies' promise to fight together in the event of an
attack. The core US alliances --- NATO, Japan, and South Korea --- fit
these descriptors neatly. A third study finds evidence that alliances
allow allies to restrain each other from going to war. Let's say Canada
wants to get involved in a conflict somewhere. Typically, it would
discuss its plans with the United States first --- and if America thinks
it's a bad idea, Canada might well listen to them. There's strong
statistical evidence that countries don't even try to start some
conflicts out of fear that an ally would disapprove. These three
findings all suggest that **[NATO and America's East Asian alliances
very likely are playing a major role in preserving the Long
Peace]{.underline}** --- which is why Trump's habit of messing around
with alliances is so dangerous. According to many Russia experts,
Vladimir **[Putin's deepest geostrategic goal is "breaking"
NATO.]{.underline}** The member states where anyone would expect him to
test NATO's commitment would be the Baltics --- Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania --- small former Soviet republics that recently became NATO
members. We can't predict if and when a rival like Putin would conclude
that America's alliances seemed weak enough to try testing them.
Hopefully, it never happens. But the more Trump attacks the foundations
of America's allies, the more likely things are to change. **[[The
absolute risk of a Russian invasion of a NATO
state]{.underline}]{.mark}** or a North Korean attack on the South is
relatively low, but the consequences **[[are so potentially catastrophic
--- nuclear war! ---]{.mark} that it's worth taking anything that
increases the odds of such a conflict seriously.]{.underline}** The
crack-up of the West? The world order is a little like a game of Jenga.
In the game, there are lots of small blocks that interlock to form a
stable tower. Each player has to remove a block without toppling the
tower. But each time you take out a block, the whole thing gets a bit
less stable. Take out enough blocks and it will collapse. The
international order works in kind of the same way. There are lots of
different interlocking parts --- the spread of democracy, American
alliances, nuclear deterrence, and the like --- that work together to
keep the global peace. But take out one block and the other ones might
not be strong enough to keep things together on their own. At the end of
the Cold War, British and French leaders worried that the passing of the
old order might prove destabilizing. In a January 1990 meeting, French
President François Mitterrand told British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher that he feared a united Germany could seize control of even
more territory than Hitler. Some experts feared that in the absence of
the external Soviet threat, Western European powers might go back to
waging war with each other. Thankfully, those predictions turned out to
be wrong. There are multiple reasons for that, but one big one --- one
that also helped keep relations between other historical enemies, like
South Korea and Japan, peaceful --- is a shared participation in US
alliance networks. The US serves as the ultimate security blanket,
preventing these countries from having to build up their own armaments
and thus risk a replay of World War I. But **[[if American alliance
commitments become and remain less credible]{.mark}, it's possible this
order could crack up. ]{.underline}**America's partners aren't stupid.
They understand that Trump is the product of deep forces in American
politics, and that his victory might not be a one-off. If they think
that this won't be the last "America First" president in modern history,
depending on America the way that they have in the past could quickly
become a nightmare. **[The worst-case scenarios for a collapse in the US
alliance system are terrible. [Imagine full Japanese and German
rearmament]{.mark}, alongside [rapid-fire prolif]{.mark}eration [of
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}. Imagine a crack-up of NATO, with
[European powers at loggerheads while Russia gobbles up the Baltic
states and the rest of Ukraine.]{.mark} Imagine [So]{.mark}uth
[Ko]{.mark}rea's historical [tensions with Japan reigniting]{.mark}, and
a war between those two countries]{.underline}** or any combination of
them and China. All of this seems impossible to imagine now, almost
absurd. And indeed, in the short run, it is. There is no risk --- zero
--- of American allies turning on each other in the foreseeable future.
And it's possible that the next president after Trump could reassure
American allies that nothing like this could ever happen again. But the
truth is that there's just no way to know. **[When a fundamental force
for world peace starts to weaken, no one can really be sure how well the
system will hold up. Nothing like this --- the leader of the world's
hegemon rounding on its most important allies --- has ever happened
before]{.underline}**. What Donald Trump's presidency has done, in
effect, is start up another geopolitical Jenga game. Slowly but surely,
he's removing the blocks that undergird global security. It's possible
the global order survives Trump --- but it's just too early for us to
say for sure. **[Given the stakes, it's a game we'd rather not
play.]{.underline}**

Mr. Chairman and Mr. Menendez, you have asked for an assessment of
NATO's value to the United States. In my judgment, **[NATO continues to
be of vital importance]{.underline}** **[to American
security]{.underline}** interests in five principal ways. First,
**[[NATO]{.mark} is at the [core]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[of]{.mark}
one of the most significant foreign policy
accomplishments]{.underline}** **[in American
history]{.underline}**---**[the creation of a long-term [peace in
Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}** following the close of the Second World
War. **[Because of NATO]{.underline}** and the emergence of the European
Union, **[Europe is [united]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[after centuries
of]{.mark} division and [war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[NATO's military
strength has been a [major reason]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[for]{.mark}
the [absence of war]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[with]{.underline}**]{.mark} the Soviet Union and
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** since 1949. A recent Atlantic Council
study reminds that America spent 14.1 percent of its GDP on defense
during the First World War, 37.5 percent during the Second World War and
13.2 percent during the Korean Conflict. We spend nothing close to those
levels now in large part due to the great power peace we have enjoyed
for over seventy years. NATO has been a major factor in that peace. And
due to the expansion of NATO and the European Union eastward after the
fall of the Soviet Union, millions of East Europeans now live in free,
democratic societies---a significant success for U.S. diplomacy. Second,
**[NATO delivers]{.underline}** additional **[benefits to]{.underline}**
U.S. **[military objectives and operations]{.underline}** beyond our
shores. **[NATO is at the [heart of]{.mark} our
[defense]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[of North America]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[Europe]{.underline}** **[from [nuclear and
conventional]{.mark} threats]{.underline}**. British and French nuclear
weapons join ours in deterring aggression in the North Atlantic area.
Since the late 1940s, every Administration has believed that **[the best
way]{.underline}** **[to defend our country is through American forces
forward deployed in Europe with the NATO allies]{.underline}**. **[This
strategy remains right for today given Russia's invasion of
Georgia]{.underline}** in 2008, **[of Crimea and Eastern
Ukraine]{.underline}** in 2014 **[and its current pressure on Estonia,
Latvia, Lithuania and Poland]{.underline}**. **[NATO remains our
[primary vehicle for deterring Putin]{.mark}]{.underline}** in Eastern
Europe. The **[NATO allies host a great number of [critical
bases]{.mark} for U.S. forces]{.underline}**---Ramstein in Germany,
Aviano in Italy, Rota in Spain, Souda Bay in Greece and Incirlik in
Turkey---**[that serve as a platform]{.underline}** **[for our presence
in Europe, as well as for U.S. [force projection against terrorist
groups]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[in North Africa and the Middle East and
for]{.underline}** our **[continued military operations in
Afghanistan]{.underline}**. **[Europe is a [critical]{.mark}
link]{.underline}** **[[in]{.mark} the development of our Ballistic
[Missile Defense]{.mark} network]{.underline}** focused on the Middle
East with Turkey, Romania, Poland, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands,
Denmark, the UK and other allies all hosting elements of this system.
**[NATO allies]{.underline}** continue to **[participate in the U.S.-led
[coalition against]{.mark} the [I]{.mark}slamic
[S]{.mark}tate]{.underline}** in the Middle East. **[Many of the allies
play [lead roles]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[in]{.underline}**]{.mark}
other **[[counter terror]{.mark} operations]{.underline}** **[such as
French forces in Mali]{.underline}** supported by the U.S. In
Afghanistan, the **[NATO allies remain with us in combat operations and
in training the Afghan military]{.underline}**. Over 1000 soldiers from
European and other partner nations have died there during the last
seventeen years. **[NATO continues to maintain the hard-earned peace in
Kosovo]{.underline}** **[with European troops bearing the large share of
the burden]{.underline}**. An EU-led force has taken on all of the
peacekeeping responsibility in Bosnia, freeing up the U.S. for other
activities. Third, **[the NATO allies are among our closest and most
supportive global partners as we [confront]{.mark} the great
[transnational challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}** that define this
century---**[the fight against [terrorism]{.mark}, the entire complex of
[cyber]{.mark} threats, [climate change]{.mark}, the risk of
[pandemics]{.mark}, mass [migration]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[and
others]{.underline}**. The **[NATO allies]{.underline}** and our
partners in the European Union **[act together]{.underline}** with us on
these and other issues. **[This is of [incalculable
benefit]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[to the U.S]{.underline}**. **[Neither
Russia nor China have treaty allies]{.underline}**. **[NATO is a
significant advantage]{.underline}** **[for the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[when it acts as a [force multiplier for
American interests]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[We are now in a new era of sustained confrontation with Russia. It is
not a broad-based competition for influence across numerous
domains]{.underline}** (e.g. economic), as is the case with China;
rather**[, it is a dynamic confrontation throughout the transatlantic
theater, most heatedly along NATO's eastern flank from the Arctic in the
north to the Black and Mediterranean Seas in the south. Russia wishes to
push its influence or direct control of territory as far west, north,
and south as possible, especially in the former Soviet states. Russia
has now demonstrated both the intent and capability to mass forces to
underwrite a sustained coercive-diplomacy campaign and invade the
sovereign territory of another nation]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[now
that Russian forces have undertaken operations in Ukraine, Putin may
decide to further threaten the territory and freedom of action of
additional non-NATO members, such as Georgia, Moldova, and
Finland]{.underline}**---**[as well as NATO members
themselves]{.underline}**. **[Russia today has a preponderance of
conventional combat forces in Eastern Europe.]{.underline}** No matter
what happens next regarding Russian military operations in Ukraine and
Belarus, **[the security environment in Europe and adjoining regions has
been structurally changed for the worse]{.underline}** for the short to
medium term. Thus, **[NATO's approach of deterrence by
punishment]{.underline}**---conducted by rapid reinforcement to its
frontline allies---**[can no longer be NATO's sole model for deterrence.
Deterrence by denial must now gain greater weight in NATO's strategic
concept.]{.underline}** Based on Russian actions, the 1997 NATO-Russia
Founding Act---and its restrictions on NATO's eastern posture---is no
longer relevant. **[We are in new, dangerous territory---a period of
sustained tensions, military moves and countermoves, and major
intermittent military crises in the Euro-Atlantic area]{.underline}**
that will ebb and flow for at least the remainder of the 2020s, if not
longer. In this environment, **[military tensions will likely be
exacerbated by increased, aggressive Russian]{.underline}**
unconventional **[activities in the homelands of NATO]{.underline}** and
European Union (EU) members. We should expect Russia, feeling the impact
of coordinated Western sanctions and other diplomatic measures, will
ramp up the level and intensity of cyberattacks, election meddling,
online disinformation, covert activities, and support for extremists in
homelands across the democratic world. On top of a local
conventional-combat power imbalance between Russian and allied forces in
Eastern Europe, and increasingly aggressive sub-threshold operations,
**[the Alliance]{.underline}** also **[faces a highly dynamic
strategic-forces balance]{.underline}**. **[Russia has undertaken a
long-term, sustained nuclear-modernization program that has produced
several new types of offensive nuclear weapons. These novel systems
present new threats to NATO, its outmoded conceptual approach to nuclear
deterrence, and its aging nuclear force inventories.]{.underline}** In
turn, **[the Alliance will need to assure its nuclear deterrent
capabilities]{.underline}**. **[Modernized and adapted NATO nuclear
capabilities must be prioritized in order for the Alliance to
effectively deter numerically superior Russian forces from attacking
NATO's eastern-flank members]{.underline}**, **[from
Norway]{.underline}** in the north **[through Lithuania]{.underline}**,
**[Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, and Turkey]{.underline}** in the
south. While **[this conclusion]{.underline}** may run counter to the
Biden administration's initial proposition to reduce US reliance on
nuclear weapons in its national security strategy**[, it would represent
a clear-eyed reappraisal of the new security environment.]{.underline}**
That Biden administration commitment was made well before the ongoing
Russian invasion of Ukraine. If President Biden were to wisely decide to
reassess this policy position, he would likely gain bipartisan and
Alliance-wide backing.

American strategists anxious to prioritize China as the "pacing
challenge" for U.S. defense strategy may object to any increase in the
resources devoted to European security. That would be a mistake.
**[Ensuring that Russia does not further destabilize Europe will have to
be]{.underline}** just as high **[a priority in the years to
come]{.underline}** as the China threat. That is because **[any
scenarios that could involve [hostile threats to NATO territory]{.mark}
could raise terrifying questions about possible escalation, even
eventually to the use of nuclear weapons, and could have existential
implications.]{.underline}** Moreover, despite the ongoing emphasis on
Asia as the most dynamic region on Earth, **[Europe remains the region
where America's preponderance of democratic, advanced, prosperous allies
is found --- and also the region where the world wars originated in
earlier eras]{.underline}**. Its strategic significance should never be
doubted. What is more, Europe's role in addressing the rise of China
will be central to any successful effort. Finally**[, to the extent
China is seen as a major challenge, it is all the more reason that
European security must be stabilized as an anchor of the future global
order]{.underline}**. **[The United States and allies do not have the
military, economic, or diplomatic bandwidth to address escalating
crises]{.underline}** and conflict in both Europe and Asia at the same
time. New crises and conflicts in Europe must be prevented before they
begin, to the maximum extent possible. I argue here that **[NATO should
shift from what has been, in effect, a tripwire defense of the Baltic
states and Poland since 2017 to a modest forward defense
posture]{.underline}**. Russian President **[Vladimir Putin must know of
NATO's unambiguous commitment to defend alliance territory and feel no
doubt that the United States and its allies would do whatever it took to
prevail in a war that he might initiate against one or more of the
alliance's members. The United States and allies should build facilities
and position forces with the intent of making this forward defense
enduring. The United States and allies should build facilities and
position forces with the intent of making this forward defense
enduring]{.underline}**. The concept of rotational deployments is no
longer appropriate given the scale of what is now needed, together with
the severity and hostility of the Russian actions that have made such
changes necessary. NATO should not adhere to its previous policy, dating
to the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act, that ruled out permanent
stationing of allied combat forces on the territories of new members.
Those days are gone. Russia, with its attack on Ukraine, has now
violated the foundational principle of that Act --- the peaceful
resolution of disputes. Nor is rotational presence less expensive than
permanent basing. Indeed, by placing upward pressure on the size of the
U.S. force posture, it risks being much more expensive, given the large
number of units it inevitably entails. Thus, **[what has been termed
NATO's enhanced forward presence (eFP) will need to beef
up]{.underline}**. Rather than have small and disparate combat
formations from many countries, **[NATO should establish enough combat
punch in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania that it could credibly fight to
protect these countries' territories in a future war against Russia,
while awaiting reinforcement from points further west]{.underline}**.
**[As the alliance's military and strategic backbone, U.S. military
formations must be an integral part of that NATO mix, to make the
alliance's commitment to successful defense and military victory
absolutely unambiguous]{.underline}**. That is the most promising way to
make deterrence robust, given what we now know about Putin and his
romanticized, twisted, dangerous vision of a greater Russia. The force
packages need not be particularly large, but they should be combat
capable, positioned in forward locations, and set up for the long term,
given the likelihood that Putin or a similar successor will remain on
the scene for many years.

On the eve of the NATO Summit in London last December, th**[e Alliance's
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg addressed the need for a collective
response to China's emergence as a global power.]{.underline}** "This is
not about moving NATO into the South China Sea," he stated, "but it's
about **[taking into account that China is coming closer to us---in the
Arctic, in Africa, investing heavily in our infrastructure in
Europe]{.underline}**, in cyberspace." At the summit, NATO heads of
state diplomatically declared that China has become a concern**[: "we
recognize that China's growing influence and international policies
present both opportunities and challenges that we need to address
together as an Alliance."]{.underline}** Indeed, it is hard, if not
impossible, for NATO to avoid China. Beijing presents a full spectrum
challenge to the transatlantic community---a challenge whose potential
mirrors, if not surpasses, that once posed by the former Soviet Union.
China's \$14 trillion economy is expected to soon surpass that of the
United States, and Beijing exercises that might in a predatory fashion
around the globe, including in the United States and Europe. China
threatens to boycott companies and countries that criticize its
policies, leverages its debt instruments against poor nations, and is
buying up critical infrastructure around the world. Its acquisition of
European ports has raised concerns of top NATO commanders who warn that
such ownership could adversely affect the Alliance's ability to use
those facilities in times of crisis. China is a technological challenge
to the West. It is a leader in 5G communications, artificial
intelligence, hyper-sonic weapons, and quantum computing. It has
demonstrated repeatedly that it is willing to exercise that prowess
against Western interests and security. Chinese cyber espionage and
disinformation campaigns have become part of daily life for all NATO
allies, including both their governments and private enterprises.
Beijing's military is a major driver behind China's technological edge
and is developing and exercising global reach. China's \$260 billion
defense budget has a purchasing power estimated to equal or exceed 70
percent of that of the US defense budget. China's military cooperation
with Russia continues to expand and the two exercise not only in the
plains of Central Asia but in the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. Chinese
military forces are the pointy of end of the spear Beijing uses to
undermine the rules based international order. Its maritime claims and
aggressive activities in South and East China Seas stand among its more
prominent actions. And, China's leadership relishes its role as an
ideological challenge to the West and the latter's practice of liberal
democracy. China usesits economic, technological, and military power to
promote globally its form of national authoritarianism. Beijing even
asserts that its political model has provided the most adept and agile
response to today's coronavirus epidemic. So how should NATO should
respond to China's growing global assertiveness? What should be NATO's
China strategy? When considering this issue, it is important to
recognize that **[the foundation for a relevant NATO role in a
transatlantic China strategy has long been established]{.underline}**.
For decades, the Alliance has been operating around the world. NATO has
led the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan since
2003. Its naval forces have patrolled against pirates off the shores of
Africa, commencing with operation OCEAN SHIELD in 2008. As a member of
the Coalition to Defeat ISIS, NATO provides training to military
establishments across the Middle East. And, on a daily basis the
Alliance addresses terrorism, cyber-threats, disinformation, and other
global issues. **[Most relevant to addressing China are the Alliance's
long-standing relationships with key democracies of the Indo-Pacific
region. NATO established Global Partnerships with Korea, New Zealand,
and Mongolia in 2012, Australia in 2013, and Japan in
2014.]{.underline}** These relationships are predominantly consultative,
but most of these partners have contributed to NATO missions, including
in Afghanistan. **[As the transatlantic community's lead instrument for
security collaboration, NATO can contribute to the former's relationship
with China in three important ways. As a multinational security forum,
it can foster among NATO allies and partners a shared awareness of
China's capacities and activities that generate risk to and opportunity
for the North Atlantic community. NATO has long served as an important
forum through which its Allies and partners share intelligence data and
assessments needed to foster and facilitate collaborative
action]{.underline}**. Second, **[NATO can help develop and promulgate a
transatlantic security strategy and posture regarding
China]{.underline}**. That strategy's objectives should include the
development of a cooperative relationship with China as well the
dissuasion of China from undermining the interests of the transatlantic
community. The latter would **[define the appropriate role and means for
the Alliance to contribute to deterrence and when necessary defense
against Chinese aggression that imperil those interests.]{.underline}**
Third, N**[ATO's civilian and military capacities should be used to
facilitate the defense and security component of a Western strategy
addressing China---including in the tasks of engagement, deterrence, and
defense]{.underline}**. The following are five actions NATO could
undertake as part of its approach to China, none of which would require
it to undertake a significant reprioritization of its current mission
sets and all of which would support the aforementioned: **[The Alliance
should offer to establish a NATO-China Council]{.underline}**. This
would mirror the NATO-Russia Council whose roots date back to 1997. Its
establishment would recognize and respond to the realty of China's
growing influence and reach. This forum would spur Alliance members to
more seriously and comprehensively address in a coordinated manner the
challenges posed by China. Its establishment would underscore that this
dimension of great power competition is not between China and the United
States but between China and the transatlantic community, one bound by
shared values, interests, and history. And this forum could be used to
identify and foster opportunities for constructive collaboration with
China, such as counter-piracy operations. Second, **[NATO should deepen
its engagement with its Pacific partners, Australia, New Zealand, the
Republic of Korea, Japan, and Mongolia.]{.underline}** The consultative
dimension of these relationships should be complemented with more
regular and more robust military exercises (especially air, maritime,
and special forces exercises) and operations, including those designed
to ensure freedom of navigation. Such events under the NATO flag would
be a useful complement to US maritime and air exercisers in the Pacific
that have long featured the participation of European allies. Past US
RIMPAC exercise series, for example, have included military aircraft,
ships, and staffs from Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, the
Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom. In less tense times, China
even participated in RIMPAC events. Third, **[the Alliance should
establish in the Indo-Pacific, perhaps]{.underline}** in one of the
region's partner countries, a Center of Excellence (COE) and integrate
officers and NCOs from selected partners into the Alliance's Command
Structure. Both initiatives would help increase the Alliance's
understanding of the Indo-Pacific region, institutionalize its presence
in the region, and deepen these partners' familiarization with NATO
missions, structures, and protocols. **[The Alliance should also
establish a small military headquarters element in the Indo-Pacific
region]{.underline}**, perhaps embedded in the COE or in United States
Pacific Command to help facilitate and coordinate NATO exercises and
operations. It, too, could contribute to Alliance's awareness of
developments in the region and, if the opportunity emerges, Alliance
collaboration with China. These initiatives will take effort to launch
and execute. Some allies will balk at adding additional missions to NATO
and their own military forces when resources are already strained. But
the aforementioned will not generate onerous costs and can build upon
European, US, and Canadian military operations in the Pacific that are
already the norm. Moreover, European attitudes toward China have
significantly hardened. Eighteen months ago, many Europeans were content
to regard China as an economic partner, notwithstanding its
authoritarian political system and aggressive conduct in the Pacific.
That has since changed as Europe has experienced with increasing
frequency Beijing's diplomatic and economic belligerence toward those
that criticize its actions and policies. In March 2019 the European
Union formally described China as a "strategic competitor," "an economic
competitor," and "a systemic rival promoting alternative models of
governance." Beijing pugnacious conduct during the coronavirus pandemic
has only reinforced this new European perspective. Beijing will likely
balk at the offer of a NATO-China council as it will oppose an increased
NATO presence in the Indo-China, especially one that fosters deeper
political-military collaboration among the region's democracies. Even
NATO Partners in Asia may balk at elevating their relations with NATO
out of a desire to avoid further complicating relations with China.
**[NATO may have to initiate its China strategy on its
own,]{.underline}** leveraging the territories Allies control in the
Indo-Pacific and conducting its own operations and exercises in the
region. That will **[demonstrate the commitment and determination
necessary to earn the confidence and support of its partners for a more
active Alliance presence in the region. China will then also be likely
to demur, realizing that having regular communication with the world's
most powerful military alliance can be important means to avoid
conflict, promote peace, and facilitate mutually useful
cooperation.]{.underline}** A NATO strategy for China alone will be not
a sufficient solution to the West's increasingly tense relationship with
Beijing**[. A coherent and effective transatlantic strategy for China
will have to be comprehensive, one that leverages the full complement of
diplomatic, economic, technological, social, and military capabilities
and dynamics that define geopolitical power. For it to have maximum
success it will have to combine the capacities of both Europe and North
America and be reinforced through collaboration with community's
democratic partners in the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**. **[As the
institution that effectively marshals the military capabilities of the
transatlantic community and one that has established relationships with
the leading states of the Indo-Pacific, NATO is well positioned to
foster that collaboration. Such NATO engagement would help underscore
that Beijing's belligerence risks provoking a geopolitically costly
reaction from a vibrant and unified global coalition of
democracies]{.underline}**. NATO's potential role in a transatlantic
strategy regarding China should not be underestimated.

As promised, President Biden and his administration are moving swiftly
to repair America's damaged relationship with its NATO allies ---
following four years in which President Donald Trump bitterly complained
that they weren't pulling their weight. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's
first official call after his confirmation was to the long-suffering
head of the NATO alliance, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg; Biden
followed up by releasing a video of his own call with Stoltenberg,
purposefully going beyond the traditional print "readout." "We've got a
mountain of work to do ahead of us, from covid to climate to tackling
security challenges," Biden told the NATO head. But once the "America is
back" calls and speeches are finished, the Biden team must face the hard
task of preparing NATO for its next chapter. Thirty years after the fall
of the Soviet Union, the mission of this organization founded after
World War II to safeguard the freedom of Western Europe and North
America is no longer clear. Restoring European allies' trust in U.S.
competence won't be enough to rehabilitate the transatlantic partnership
if the allies don't solve this identity crisis. With Trump gone, the
alliance can't simply go back to business as usual --- because for some
time now business as usual in NATO has meant taking on more and more
roles and activities in a frantic quest for relevance. And while Trump
absolutely damaged the alliance, it would be foolhardy to blame all of
its problems on him: Mission drift, for instance, long predated his
administration. **[A longer-term corrective may involve reorienting the
security organization's focus toward its traditional role of deterring
and defending against strategic competitors: Russia,]{.underline}** yes,
but even more so **[China. That nation is the obvious successor to the
mid-20th-century Soviet Union in harboring global ideological
aspirations at odds with those of the major Western
democracies]{.underline}** The end of the Cold War understandably
precipitated NATO's identity crisis. With U.S. guidance, the
organization pivoted away from its longtime focus on collective defense
against Moscow --- an attack on one member would be considered an attack
on all --- toward a global peace-enforcement role. The security of
nations outside the alliance became a concern on the theory that
instability and violence beyond NATO's borders could spill over onto
alliance territory, and because intervention to stop humanitarian
catastrophes was seen as inherently right. (In the 1990s, then-Sen.
Richard Lugar famously declared that the alliance must go "out of area"
lest it risk going "out of business.") This shift was accompanied by
expansion: Since the late '90s, NATO has nearly doubled its membership,
from 16 to 30, incorporating states that were once part of the Soviet
Union, like Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, or members of the Warsaw
Treaty Organization, like Poland. Early examples of NATO's new role
included the bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 to halt violence against
Kosovar civilians perpetrated by Slobodan Milosevic's regime, followed
by peacekeeping duties there. In 2003, NATO took on the task of
enforcing peace in Afghanistan after the invasion by a U.S.-led
coalition. In 2011, it intervened in Libya to impose a U.N. Security
Council cease-fire resolution on the Moammar Gaddafi regime. Obama
embraced 'endless wars.' Biden probably will, too. Civil strife and
violence in these and other hotspots are unlikely to recede anytime
soon, but NATO is ill equipped to fix such **[problems. Worldwide crisis
stabilization is too open-ended a goal to serve as the organizing
principle for a military alliance --- and such ambitions stretch
valuable NATO resources at a time when threats to the North Atlantic
region are growing. Refocusing NATO to check the dangers posed by
China's rise would restore it to something closer to its original
mission of safeguarding allies from strategic
competitors]{.underline}**. What about Russia? It remains meddlesome,
but it is largely under control --- and a shadow of its former self.
**[Yes, Moscow retains the ability to wreak havoc in any manner of ways,
but in conventional military terms it doesn't pose the same threat to
the alliance it once did, and NATO has moved swiftly to counter what
threat there i]{.underline}**s. Following Russia's 2014 annexation of
Crimea, NATO established new commands and headquarters in Poland, Latvia
and Romania --- its biggest investment in force structure since the Cold
War. There remain areas of internal disagreement: On matters like the
spreading of misinformation in elections, some European members ---
France, for instance --- seem inclined to shrug off President Vladimir
Putin's provocations. And Germany in particular is eager to embrace
financial and energy collaborations with Russia (though it faces
pressure to back off as Putin clamps down on dissidents). Putin will use
these splits to try to divide the allies against themselves, but **[on
the big question --- checking and containing Russian military
adventurism --- NATO is united, and effective.]{.underline}** It is
China that represents the bigger menace over the long term to Western
values and interests. At present, China is primarily an economic and
political threat, not a military one, but NATO should prepare for the
latter possibility, given Beijing's increasingly assertive foreign
policy. After all, it has cracked down on Hong Kong, clashed with India
in the Himalayas, levied tariffs on Australia after officials criticized
its handling of the coronavirus, and said Britain would "bear the
consequences" for excluding telecom firm Huawei from its 5G network.
China has been steadily investing in European infrastructure: State-run
shipping companies own significant stakes in 13 European ports, for
instance, and the telecom equipment company ZTE has a large presence in
southeastern Europe. When countries cede control of their
infrastructure, their "resilience," or ability to recover from the shock
of a natural disaster or armed attack, suffers. (Maintaining resilience
is a core part of NATO's mission statement.) Such developments also make
it easier for Beijing to impose its will on NATO members --- by
threatening to end access to a port, say. China has already proved
itself adept at using other tools in its arsenal --- such as economic
influence --- to intimidate and coerce states, as when Beijing imposed
an eight-year ban on Norwegian salmon in retaliation for the awarding of
the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to a Chinese dissident. To safeguard against
a future when China decides to use its growing military power in similar
fashion, NATO should invest more in military assets and planning today.
**[Narrowing the alliance's focus and prioritizing China]{.underline}**
hardly mean that NATO-flagged vessels would appear tomorrow in the South
China Sea, where Beijing has been expanding its naval bases. The shift
would, at least at first, **[represent more of a change in strategic
mind-set.]{.underline}** But China has already begun to encroach on the
North Atlantic region. In the Arctic, for example, Beijing is working on
liquid-natural-gas drilling projects with Russia; it is also sending
icebreakers to the Norwegian Sea. To address these developments, **[NATO
could start by formally including the "High North" in its strategic
documents for the first time and by increasing its presence in the
region. Biden certainly seems focused on China at the national level ---
promising to maintain Trump's tougher stance, without the
counterproductive measures (like tariffs)]{.underline}** --- but it is
not clear that his administration has grasped the **[role NATO can
pla]{.underline}**y. When the president spoke with Stoltenberg, he
proposed adding global issues ranging from democratic backsliding to
climate change and the pandemic to the alliance's agenda. Defense
Secretary Austin similarly identified a laundry list of tasks, including
tackling corruption and international criminal organizations, during the
NATO defense ministers' meeting in February. Still, **[at a Munich
Security Conference event last month, Biden said that America and its
allies "must prepare together for long-term strategic competition with
China." And there's a growing movement in D.C. think tanks --- from
which Biden is drawing many of his advisers --- arguing for such an
orientation. Stoltenberg, an early and frequent advocate of having NATO
address the implications of China's rise, would be a key figure in the
refocusing: In his own comments at the Munich gathering, he stressed
that China is the "defining issue" for the transatlantic relationship.
Stoltenberg and a group tasked with charting the alliance's long-term
course --- the NATO 2030 working group --- have recommended deepening
and broadening relationships with partners in the Indo-Pacific
region]{.underline}**. By necessity, **[refocusing on China would
involve curtailing NATO's other sprawling activities]{.underline}** ---
beneficial in itself. Beyond ending the training and advising missions
in Iraq and Afghanistan, pausing NATO expansion would make sense, since
it would be inadvisable to add new members --- such as Ukraine and
Georgia, thereby provoking Russia --- as it works out its identity
crisis. Russia is already pretty much contained; admitting Ukraine and
Georgia, a move for which many Europeans have little appetite anyway,
would doom arms-control and other negotiations with Moscow. Regrettably,
as with Russia, Europe is divided over how to deal with China. Many
European allies are wary of picking sides in the struggle for influence
between the United States and its Asian rival. Some, like Germany, even
appear outright resentful at the suggestion that they must choose.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel rushed last year to conclude the
E.U.-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment --- even though the
incoming U.S. national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, had strongly
signaled that Europe should wait till Biden's inauguration. China's rise
is indisputably the most significant geopolitical development of the
21st century. It would be strange for an alliance as potent as NATO to
ignore the challenge. A Europe that continues to downplay the danger
posed by China's growing influence in the North Atlantic area could lead
Xi to succeed where Trump and Putin failed: He could splinter the
alliance. International organizations like NATO move slowly, and it will
take time to lay the groundwork for tackling the security implications
of China's ascendance. By beginning that shift now, the alliance may
avoid a greater challenge later.

**[At their recent meeting in Brussels, NATO leaders agreed an ambitious
transatlantic agenda for the future: NATO 2030. The alliance is
determined to address global developments relevant to its security by
strengthening and broadening political consultations]{.underline}**;
further enhancing resilience; fostering technological innovation;
tackling the implications of climate change as a threat multiplier; and
**[increasing cooperation with partners, including in the Asia-Pacific.
The vigorous implementation of these commitments will help NATO to deal

threat to Euro-Atlantic security. Its growing cooperation with China
carries the risk of concurrent strategic challenges in the Euro-Atlantic
and Indo-Pacific region]{.underline}**s. **[The United States considers
China its primary strategic competitor and is shifting its strategic
focus to the Asia-Pacific. NATO must therefore ensure Euro-Atlantic
stability. Credible deterrence and defense against Russia remain its
priority task. The new Strategic Concept must address all these
challenges, ensure a shared strategic vision, and strengthen alliance
cohesion.]{.underline}** KATE HANSEN BUNDTSECRETARY GENERAL OF THE
NORWEGIAN ATLANTIC COMMITTEE **[NATO's joint statement on China as a
systemic challenge to the rules-based international order and the
summit's approval of the NATO 2030 reform package were necessary steps
in NATO getting ready for China.]{.underline}** But this was far from
saying that China is a challenge that will trigger conventional military
use or out-of-area operations for NATO. NATO needs to confront China in
areas where it poses a challenge to the alliance. Facing cyber,
technological, and other asymmetric threats, such as disinformation
campaigns and attempts to influence political decisionmaking processes,
calls for action. And clearly, out-of-area does not apply to these
threats. China is becoming a global power in terms of high technology.
Chinese companies are already center stage when it comes to surveillance
technology. And in the race to control and influence the global digital
infrastructure, China is playing an increasingly bigger role in the
development of technological standards. It is also expanding its nuclear
programs. Together this is challenging alliance security and democratic
values. In addition, China has been growing as a global economic
superpower through its direct investments in European infrastructure,
which also calls for allied awareness. **[If NATO members are to protect
their common values, it is vital that they stand up against
authoritarian forces that want to undermine the allies. Following the
summit this week, NATO member states have jointly agreed that this is a
battle they want to take on together.]{.underline}** RALUCA
CSERNATONIVISITING SCHOLAR AT CARNEGIE EUROPE The rise of China and the
evolving Sino-U.S. great power rivalry are the defining geopolitical
features of our time. They will unquestionably have a defining impact on
NATO's 2030 agenda and its new Strategic Concept. China's rise as a
high-tech great power and systemic challenger should be seen as an
opportunity to remember NATO's very purpose as a high-level political
and military organization. But **[NATO requires the United States and
the EU to come together and improve joint strategic awareness, encourage
a coherent Euro-Atlantic approach for the Indo-Pacific, and recommit to
the defense of common democratic values and a rules-based international
order.]{.underline}** **[A first step in the right direction was NATO
leaders taking a tougher line on China at the Brussels
summit.]{.underline}** Details about a specific NATO China policy in the
communiqué were sparse. But an emphasis on China shows that the
alliance's traditional and still almost exclusive Russia focus is
slightly shifting. China's military reach is getting closer to the
Euro-Atlantic area. It will likely challenge the alliance's ability to
build collective resilience, safeguard critical infrastructure, address
emerging and disruptive technologies, and protect sensitive supply
chains. Such wide-ranging challenges are complex. They will require a
comprehensive EU-U.S. **[NATO approach and a shared vision as well as a
constructive dialogue with China where possible. The alliance will also
need to overcome substantial and potentially show-stopping
intra-alliance political and military organizational
hurdles.]{.underline}** Closer cooperation with the EU, given its
regulatory, economic, and technological innovation instruments, would
also enable NATO to respond to the multifaceted risks and threats of
this new era. MARTA DASSÙSENIOR DIRECTOR OF EUROPEAN AFFAIRS AT THE

consider China as a potential security challenge, NATO is ready. China
will figure prominently in the new Strategic Concept, to be approved in
2022. For the first time in a NATO communiqué, China's military buildup
is considered to be a systemic challenge to alliance security. And
NATO's new global agenda entails commitments in critical fields,
amplified by or related to China's rise: from value chains'
vulnerabilities in strategic sectors to the need to preserve a
technology edge in defense; from countering cyber attacks---mostly from
Russia but also from China---to reinforcing resilience of democratic
societies.]{.underline}** If, however, "ready" means that NATO will
engage military in the Asia-Pacific region, this is not the case: NATO
is not turning into a Sino-centric alliance. And Washington is not
asking NATO to support the United States militarily in Asia. Joe Biden
is suggesting, instead, a new transatlantic bargain: NATO, with renewed
American commitment, will focus mainly on Europe and collective
defense---and here Russia remains the main military threat for the
alliance. At the same time, European allies will support Washington in
containing China, first of all in diplomatic and economic terms. Is
Europe ready to sustain its part of the bargain? This is the key
question, to which Europeans still reply with some ambiguity.

Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine dominated the NATO defense ministers\'
meeting in Brussels, but the ministers --- including Secretary of

Russia\'s unprovoked invasion of neighboring Ukraine, NATO Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg said yesterday at a press conference. This
drastically changed the security environment in Europe and the globe, he
said. \"We must set out NATO\'s response for the longer term,\" he said.
\"At the summit, we will take decisions to make NATO even stronger and
more agile in a world that is more dangerous and more competitive. I am
confident that the Madrid Summit will be a transformative summit.\"

relentless war of attrition against Ukraine,\" Stoltenberg said. \"NATO
allies and partners have been providing Ukraine \[with\] unprecedented

Many NATO countries --- including the United States --- have announced
additional assistance, including much needed heavy weapons and
long-range systems.]{.underline}** But as Russian President Vladimir
Putin\'s war continues, the ministers discussed plans to support Ukraine
for the long haul. \"**[We are putting together a NATO comprehensive

further strengthening security institutions]{.underline}**,\"

is a game-changer,\" he said. \"So, NATO must maintain credible
deterrence and strong defense.\" The defense ministers addressed the
scale and design of our future posture --- the so-called footprint of
NATO forces in Europe. They also discussed how the alliance can work in
all domains of warfare: land, sea, air, cyberspace and space. On land,
the idea is \"**[more NATO forward-deployed combat formations to
strengthen our battlegroups in the eastern part of our
alliance]{.underline}**,\" Stoltenberg said. He said there will be more
air, sea and cyber defenses, as well as pre-positioned equipment and

#### Active denial solves China \[short\]

Even as events in Iraq, Syria, and Ukraine have captured the attention
of U.S. foreign policy elites, the United States faces key questions
about its military position in Asia. In **[the face of growing Chinese
power, can the United States continue to provide a credible deterrent in
Asia without either bankrupting itself or pursuing risky strategies that
raise new questions about crisis stability?]{.underline}** While other
security issues remain important, none will have a more fundamental
effect on the U.S. military budget or the way the United States does
business overseas. Basic precepts of U.S. foreign and security policy
are under debate. Notable commentators have recently argued that U.S.
forward defenses in Asia are no longer viable and that the United States
should transition to a less engaged strategy of "offshore balancing."
Others have countered that the right combination of new technologies and
offensive systems might yet restore U.S. dominance. While we welcome the
new debate, neither of the most prominent alternative approaches is
advisable. The United States requires a new strategy, one that does more
to assure U.S. partners than offshore balancing but that is also
affordable and does not rely on a vulnerable hair-trigger offensive
posture. Fortunately, **[the United States could realize such a
strategy, though it would require significant diplomatic efforts as well
as a variety of military adjustments. What we label an "active denial
strategy" would maintain a forward presence but be oriented toward
denying an opponent the benefits of military aggression, rather than
trying to ensure a decisive defeat. The strategy would have three
primary features: first, a resilient force posture and the exploitation
of strategic depth; second, a focus on combat against offensive maneuver
forces instead of strikes against home territories; and third,
leveraging the capabilities of allies and partners. This active denial
strategy aligns well with the status quo nature of U.S. interests and
provides a cost-effective deterrent that would reduce rather than
increase the incentives for pre-emption during crises.
What]{.underline}** follows is an outline of the challenges facing U.S.
diplomats and commanders in Asia, the state of the debate on U.S.
military strategy today, and an alternative to current options that
offers a better combination of attributes.

#### Active denial strategy of deterrence effectively solves Chinese adventurism by flipping their cost-exchange ratio -- prevents US-China war \[long\]

**[An active denial strategy seeks to deter Chinese adventurism by
maintaining a capability to refuse China the benefits of military
aggression.]{.underline}** This is different than maintaining
all-aspects dominance. Dominance is fast becoming prohibitively
expensive and may well be inadvisable when confronting a nuclear-armed
great power. Instead, **[active denial involves both defending the
territory of U.S. allies and partners as well as making retaliatory
strikes against Chinese combat forces involved in offensive operations.
The active denial strategy differs from the offshore control strategy by
meeting Chinese aggression directly, thereby making it more difficult
for China to achieve a fait accompli.]{.underline}** Unlike the
alternative approaches outlined earlier, active denial offers a broad
strategy that includes many branch options for a U.S. president.
**[There are three mutually-reinforcing components of the active denial
strategy. The first is resilient U.S. combat power, capable of surviving
a pre-emptive Chinese strike; this will require a portfolio of
adjustments to survivability and deployment patterns. The second is
capabilities optimized for attacking Chinese forces directly engaged in
offensive operations such as amphibious ships, aircraft, and landed
forces. And the third is bolstering and leveraging the capabilities of
allies and partners. The United States should assist partners in
improving their defensive capabilities (create mini-A2/AD bubbles) as
well as fully using the geographic advantages offered by partner
states.]{.underline}** A Resilient Force **[Surviving a pre-emptive
Chinese strike requires that U.S. forces be resilient in the face of
Chinese attacks. This includes a portfolio of measures including
hardening airbase facilities; dispersing aircraft and other critical
assets; prepositioning missile defenses; employing camouflage and
concealment, electronic warfare, and rapid repair capabilities; as well
as developing procedures and training for fighting under
attack.]{.underline}** Making aircraft carriers and air bases
operationally resilient introduces risk into Chinese military options by
denying the PLA confidence in its ability to suppress U.S. air power.
Dispersal can take two forms. On-base dispersal spreads aircraft,
maintenance equipment, and fuel supplies around a given base and
minimizes the amount of damage that a single arriving weapon can do.
Theater-level dispersal spreads aircraft across more locations in order
to minimize the impact of losing any single location. U.S. Marine Corps
concepts for distributed operations using the short takeoff and vertical
landing F-35B from improvised bases offer an extreme example of
theater-level dispersal. The Marines have also demonstrated their
capability to operate conventional fighters from expeditionary
airfields, for example during the 2012 Geiger Fury exercise held on the
island of Tinian in the Northern Marianas. In a similar vein, the U.S.
Air Force has developed a "Rapid Raptor" concept for quickly deploying
F-22 fighters to austere locations for short periods. **[Dispersal will
stress combat support capacity, likely requiring Army support for key
enablers such as logistics, security forces, and combat engineers. All
of these dispersal concepts would complicate Chinese targeting and offer
survivability benefits]{.underline}**. In addition to dispersal, **[the
operational resilience portfolio will need to include some hardening of
key facilities (air bases, command-and-control centers, and
ports).]{.underline}** Hardening key nodes at those facilities (e.g.,
communications, fuel storage, and aircraft) can be a cost-effective way
to mitigate vulnerabilities. This could involve reinforcing existing
buildings with steel or concrete or constructing new bunkers and
underground facilities (if local geography permits). However, attempting
to make entire facilities invulnerable is prohibitively costly, and
probably unrealistic. Therefore, hardening efforts must pursue
cost-effective ways of protecting critical capabilities. U.S. forces
would come under the most intense attacks at the start of a conflict.
Consequently, **[a resilient force posture would seek to exploit U.S.
strategic depth in Asia.]{.underline}** At the outset, relatively more
U.S. forces might be deployed at a distance from China, rather than
being concentrated overwhelmingly in China's immediate periphery as they
are today. **[Long-range bombers flying from lower threat areas, in
conjunction with submarines firing cruise missiles, could provide a
great deal of U.S. combat power during the opening phase of a conflict.
Resilient air bases and carriers near conflict areas will generate
sorties to support these other assets, and will become a primary means
of attack as adversary surveillance capabilities are diminished and
missiles inventories exhausted.]{.underline}** Missile defenses (such as
Navy ships armed with SM-3 interceptors and the Army's Patriot air
defense system) can intercept some portion of incoming ballistic
missiles. These capabilities are far from perfect but they can reduce
the number of missiles that could reach defended aircraft carriers and
bases, forcing an adversary to expend more missiles to achieve its goals
and drawing down its finite quiver of ballistic missiles more quickly.
In the future, directed energy systems might augment these layered
defenses.14 Camouflage, concealment, and deception could complicate
China's ability to locate U.S. forces. A final component of the
resilience portfolio lies in rapid repair capabilities. The U.S. Air
Force recently demonstrated a rapid runway repair capability able to
fill dozens of craters in an air base's runways and taxiways in eight
hours.15 In the event of a conflict, this resilience portfolio would
multiply targets and confuse PLA planners, thereby minimizing the damage
that a Chinese attack could do and enabling U.S. forces to rapidly
rebound from what damage did occur. **[Although U.S. forces would
initially be deployed in greater depth than they are today, resilience
would not require ceding ground to China from the outset.]{.underline}**
Some U.S. forces would remain in areas close to China during peacetime
and at the outset of a conflict**[. And as the war progressed, the
resilient force posture would permit U.S. forces to shift their center
of gravity back towards the Chinese mainland]{.underline}**. Countering
Attacking Forces A robust ability to counter Chinese power projection
will require another portfolio of capabilities. The United States must
be prepared to counter power projection in three domains: naval forces,
air power, and landed forces. The strategy focuses on defeating PLA
assets beyond China's shores, rather than on striking mainland targets.
In countering Chinese naval forces, **[U.S. submarines will continue to
have a significant advantage over Chinese anti-submarine warfare
capabilities.]{.underline}** But U.S. submarines have capacity
limitations both in how many torpedoes each carries and how many
submarines can operate in a given area. In addition to submarines, the
military will need an expanded inventory of joint long-range anti-ship
missiles. Integrating such missiles on U.S. Air Force aircraft will
expand anti-surface warfare capacity. Land-based anti-ship cruise
missiles, either operated by the Army or by U.S. allies, could also play
a role, as could modern anti-ship mines. Expanding the ability to
air-deliver mines from stand-off ranges would give the U.S. military
additional flexibility and free up other highdemand assets such as
submarines. **[In countering Chinese air power, the first line of
defense would be provided by U.S. aircraft from aircraft carriers and
resilient ground bases working in conjunction with allied air
forces.]{.underline}** Air defenses, in the form of U.S. Navy air
defense destroyers and cruisers or land-based air defenses such as the
Patriot system, could provide a second line of defense. Allies and
partners could contribute to this second line of defense with their own
assets. These could be bolstered by foreign military sales facilitated
by the United States and possibly by Japan, which has recently relaxed
its ban on arms exports. To defeat landed forces, a combination of
capabilities would again be required. Many of the same weapons needed to
attack adversary surface warfare groups could be used to interdict
amphibious forces before they reached land. A suite of weapons could be
used against beachheads, including air-delivered weapons optimized to
attack ground forces (such as cluster munitions and sensor-fused
weapons), naval fires (land-attack missiles and, in the future, perhaps
rail guns), and ground-based fires (including artillery, multiple-launch
rocket systems, and anti-tank guided missiles). **[The ultimate means of
reducing Chinese ground forces is through land power, ideally that of a
partner or ally but potentially with U.S. support]{.underline}**.
Leveraging Allied Strengths **[The third component of a denial strategy
is buttressing allied strengths and capitalizing on partner geography.
One possibility is to assist allies and partners in creating their own
A2/AD zones equipped with air defenses, anti-ship cruise missiles,
mines, and sensor networks.]{.underline}** By focusing on defensive
weapons, the effort would seek to **[make U.S. partners and allies
dangerous porcupines whose capabilities would only be a threat to an
aggressor seeking to change the status quo]{.underline}**. A second
important facet will be improving partners' ability to operate with U.S.
forces. Measures could include combined training exercises, data sharing
procedures, military advisors, embedded liaisons, and prepositioned
supplies to enable U.S. forces to rapidly deploy into the country.
During peacetime, the sales of key defensive systems and combined
training exercises will demonstrate the challenges China would face if
it attempted to change the status quo through force. Increasing the
scope and frequency of exercises would also improve familiarity between
the United States and its partners, enabling them to operate together
better should deterrence fail. The April 2014 agreement with the
Philippines regarding an expanded U.S. rotational presence is an
important step in deepening contact between the U.S. military and key
allies and partners.16 Shifting the Cost-Exchange Ratio **[All three
elements of the denial strategy are designed to turn the tyranny of
distance on its head, or at least to neutralize the most significant
disadvantages posed by geography. China can, and likely will, build
power projection forces (]{.underline}**i.e. longer-range missiles,
aerial tankers, longer-range bombers, and improved satellitebased
communications and surveillance) to challenge the United States farther
from its coast. But **[these systems will begin to place China on the
losing side of cost-exchange ratios.]{.underline}** The two-stage
missiles required to strike targets beyond roughly 1,000 kilometers are
more expensive than singlestage systems, and all other things equal,
doubling the range of a bomber roughly doubles its cost. In summary**[,
the resiliency measures described above make U.S. forces less lucrative
targets against which China would have to launch more expensive missiles
and bombers. If executed correctly, this strategy would proliferate
targets more quickly and more cheaply than China could add to its
missile inventory.]{.underline}** On the U.S. side, although many of the
capabilities required for an active denial strategy would be provided by
legacy systems (such as Virginia-class attack submarines and long-range
cruise missiles carried by B-52 and B-1 bombers) some new or expanded
capabilities would be required. Improving the resilience of air bases
and the survivability of aircraft carriers would require new spending in
areas such as electronic warfare, rapid repair capabilities, and
hardening. The most expensive element would likely be missile defenses
with, for example, a single SM-3 interceptor costing approximately \$10
million.17 Although some new capabilities would be required under an
active denial strategy, their total costs would be far less than those
associated with a strategy aimed at restoring all-aspects dominance.
Moreover, the strategy would probably not require an increase in the
overall defense budget. Curtailing investment in conventional prompt
global strike and reducing the F-35 buy, which would become less
critical under a strategy that does not depend on penetrating Chinese
mainland air defenses, are savings that could pay for the active denial
strategy. As of 2013, the total acquisition cost of the F-35 program was
estimated at over \$320 billion (in 2012 dollars).18 The F-35 will still
be a key U.S. Air Force capability, and one that is critical for air
superiority, but fewer of these aircraft would be required under a
strategy predicated on a dynamic defense-in-depth, or active denial
strategy.

**[If a conflict with China arises, the United States will need a
strong, cohesive NATO]{.underline}**, as well as other partnerships
around the world **[to maintain order and security]{.underline}** in
Europe's neighborhood, and perhaps even beyond**[. The United States
remains committed to Europe's security and stability. But it also
expects its European allies to pick up their share of the burden for
collective securit]{.underline}**y so as to help maintain order in the
continent and around the globe. **[It is of vital importance to the
United States that its defense and security relationship with European
countries, especially within NATO, not only remains healthy but is
correctly oriented to current and likely future
challenges.]{.underline}** Several things remain to be achieved if
**[Europe and the United States]{.underline}** in this regard. First,
they **[must build a common approach]{.underline}** not only **[in
defense]{.underline}**, but across **[economic, information, and
political domains.]{.underline}** Second, they must solve the
**[continued inequity in burden sharing that hinders a stronger
relationship between them and erodes the confidence of many Americans in
the efficacy of NATO]{.underline}**. Third, it is necessary to achieve
greater coherence on NATO's eastern flank, particularly in the Black Sea
region. Fourth, NATO must continue its efforts to improve its deterrence
capability against Russia's aggressive behavior. The interests and
responsibilities of the United States are global, with freedom of
navigation on the seas and preservation of the global commons being
prime examples. Its allies and partners benefit from these freedoms as
well, but these have now **[come under threat, most notably in the South
China Sea and with China's growing control over much of the
infrastructure of the world, particularly in Europe and Africa. The
threat from China is real and growing]{.underline}**, and if it
materializes the United States will need a strong, cohesive NATO, as
well as other partnerships around the world to maintain order and
security in Europe's neighborhood, and perhaps even beyond, while the
majority of its forces and capabilities, particularly air and naval
ones, are operating in the Pacific theater. **[The stability, security,
and economic prosperity of the United States are directly linked to that
of Europe. The bulk of its global economic relationships are in North
America and the European Union, and the majority of its most reliable
allies and partners are in Europe.]{.underline}** To give but one
example, the shared intelligence obtained from Europe is essential to
the implementation of the recently published U.S. National Defense
Strategy. In this context, it **[is of vital importance to the United
States that its defense and security relationship with European
countries, especially within NATO, not only remains healthy but is
correctly oriented to current and likely future
challenges.]{.underline}** The U.S. Priority: China A war between China
and the United States is not inevitable, but **[the next 15 years could
see the eruption of]{.underline}** such a **[conflict]{.underline}**.
While this may not reach the threshold of full-scale war or a nuclear
conflict, **[the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have set
their country on a trajectory that will lead to]{.underline}** a
strategic situation that may result in s**[ustained armed conflict,
potentially stretching across the Pacific region, in all
domains.]{.underline}** Furthermore, the **[combination of China's huge
population, export-oriented economy, and lack of natural
resources]{.underline}** could **[generate an inexorable push towards
conflict.]{.underline}** **[The CCP leadership has emphasized the
development of military capabilities that could deny the U.S. Navy
access to the South China Sea, including long-range air and missile
defense and anti-ship capabilities.]{.underline}** This anti-access area
denial (A2AD) capability does not depend on a large Chinese navy but
instead uses well-protected, land-based systems. **[The creation of
artificial islands in the region, most of which are already being armed
and garrisoned with A2AD capabilities, are violations of international
law and agreements that clearly demonstrate the CCP's strategy and
intentions.]{.underline}** Enforcement of freedom of the seas and
recognized international waters by the United States and others is
necessary to counter these policies. In one recent demonstration of CCP
intent, there was a near-collision incident between Chinese and U.S.
Navy ships, caused by unsafe and unprofessional behavior by the Chinese
one. Statements by the China's minister of defense during his recent
visit to the Pentagon, including demands that the U.S. forces stay away
from the articifial islands, indicate that his country will continue to
push aggressively its territorial claims. Meanwhile, **[in Europe China
has become an increasingly significant and potentially divisive
influence in a variety of aspects; especially in infrastructure,
technology transfer, and trade. The Belt and Road Initiative has
resulted in dramatic increases in Chinese investment in Europe, control
of hundreds of European companies, and ownership or control of more than
10 percent of Europe's ports]{.underline}**. These developments, and the
CCP's strategy and behavior, are **[cause for concern about the
potential for conflict with China within the next 15
years.]{.underline}** They also show why **[the United States must
prepare for this eventuality.]{.underline}** During the Cold War, the
United States used a "two and a half wars" framework for force
structure. This was not a strategy, but rather a mechanism meant to
assess how much capability and capacity its armed forces needed to deter
effectively and, if necessary, win simultaneous conflicts in two
different operational theaters and "hold" in a third, minor theater at
the same time, for as long as necessary. Today, and for the foreseeable
future, the United States can no longer exercise this capability and
capacity. Therefore, **[in the event of conflict with China, it will
need a strong, cohesive NATO as well as partnerships around the world in
order to continue deterring a revanchist Russia and to carry on
counter-terrorism operations in the Middle East while the majority of
U.S. forces and capabilities are operating in the
Pacific.]{.underline}** The U.S. Commitment to Europe Many **[European
leaders have expressed uncertainty about the United States' commitment
to Europe]{.underline}**, based on **[President Barack Obama's "pivot to
the Pacific"]{.underline}** and, more recently, President Donald
**[Trump's questioning of the relevance and value of NATO and the
EU]{.underline}**. The facts on the ground, however, demonstrate that
the United States, including the current administration, is fully
committed to its long-time allies and partners in Europe. Everything
promised by the Obama administration at the 2016 NATO summit in Warsaw
is being delivered by the Trump administration: a rotational armored
brigade combat team, pre-positioned equipment for an army armored
division, and the Enhanced Forward Presence battle group in Poland. The
administration just announced an additional 1,500 soldiers in an
artillery brigade and short-range air defense battalion that will be
assigned to Europe. The operational contingency fund, known as the
European Reassurance Initiative, which started during the Obama
administration, has increased steadily over the last three years and is
now known as the European Deterrence Initiative, reflecting U.S. backing
for Europe and deterrence of Russia. Also telling was the Senate vote
just prior to this year's NATO's summit in Brussels, which affirmed by a
98:2 margin U.S. support for Article 5. The United States' commitment to
European partners like Ukraine and Georgia also remains very strong, as
evidenced by provision of the Javelin anti-tank weapon system, other
equipment, and training, as well as continued support for these
countries' eventual membership in NATO and the return of their
territories from Russia.

#### Solves war with China

Ben **Hodges 18**, Pershing Chair in Strategic Studies at the Center for
European Policy Analysis, "Why the United States Needs a Cohesive NATO,"
<https://www.gmfus.org/news/why-united-states-needs-cohesive-nato/micahw>

[If a conflict with China arises]{.underline}, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [will need a
strong]{.underline}, **[cohesive NATO]{.underline}**, as well as other
partnerships around the world [to]{.underline} **[maintain
order]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[security]{.underline}** in
Europe's neighborhood, and perhaps even beyond. [The]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [remains]{.underline}
**[committed]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} Europe's [security and
stability]{.underline}. But it also expects its European allies to pick
up their share of the burden for collective security so as to help
maintain order in the continent and around the globe. [It is of vital
importance to the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [that its]{.underline} defense and security
[relationship with]{.underline} European countries, especially within
**[NATO]{.underline}**, [not only]{.underline} **[remains
healthy]{.underline}** [but is **correctly oriented**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} current and likely future [challenges]{.underline}.

Several things remain to be achieved if Europe and the United States in
this regard. First, they must build a common approach not only in
defense, but across economic, information, and political domains.
Second, they must solve the continued inequity in burden sharing that
hinders a stronger relationship between them and erodes the confidence
of many Americans in the efficacy of NATO. Third, it is necessary to
achieve greater coherence on NATO's eastern flank, particularly in the
Black Sea region. Fourth, NATO must continue its efforts to improve its
deterrence capability against Russia's aggressive behavior.

The [interests and responsibilities of the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [are]{.underline}
**[global]{.underline}**, [with]{.underline} **[freedom of
navigation]{.underline}** on the seas [and preservation of
the]{.underline} **[global commons]{.underline}** being prime examples.
Its [allies and partners]{.underline} **[benefit]{.underline}** [from
these freedoms as well]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} these
[have]{.underline} now **[come under threat]{.underline}**, most notably
[in the]{.underline} **[S]{.underline}**outh **[C]{.underline}**hina
**[S]{.underline}**ea [and with China's]{.underline} **[growing
control]{.underline}** [over]{.underline} much of the infrastructure of
the world, particularly in **[Europe]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[Africa]{.underline}**. [The threat from China is]{.underline} **[real
and growing]{.underline}**, and [if it materializes the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [will need a
strong]{.underline}, **[cohesive NATO]{.underline}**, as well as other
partnerships around the world [to maintain order and
security]{.underline} in Europe's neighborhood, and perhaps even beyond,
while the majority of its forces and capabilities, particularly air and
naval ones, are operating in the Pacific theater.

[The **stability**]{.underline}, **[security]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[economic prosperity]{.underline}** [of
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[are]{.underline} **[directly linked]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
that of [Europe]{.underline}. The bulk of its global economic
relationships are in North America and the European Union, and the
majority of its most reliable allies and partners are in Europe. To give
but one example, [the]{.underline} **[shared intelligence]{.underline}**
obtained from Europe [is]{.underline} **[essential]{.underline}** [to
the implementation of the]{.underline} recently published
**[U]{.underline}**.**[S]{.underline}**. **[N]{.underline}**ational
**[D]{.underline}**efense **[S]{.underline}**trategy. In this context,
[it is of **vital importance**]{.underline} [to the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [that its defense and
security relationship with]{.underline} European countries, especially
within **[NATO]{.underline}**, [not only remains]{.underline}
**[healthy]{.underline}** [but is]{.underline} **[correctly

### Impacts \-\-- Cohesion k Baltics/Arctic

#### Solves war in Baltic Seas, North Atlantic, and Arctic.

"Cohesion in the EU and Nato will keep the peace in Baltic Sea,"
Frivarld,
https://frivarld.se/sakerhetsradet/cohesion-in-eu-and-nato-will-keep-the-peace-in-baltic-sea/micahw

I would argue that [in the situation we now are in]{.underline}, [in the
Baltic Sea Region]{.underline}, **[cohesion]{.underline}** in the EU and
[in]{.underline} **[NATO]{.underline}** [is the]{.underline} **[most
important challenge]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline}
**[stronger]{.underline}** [the confidence in the cohesion
of]{.underline} the EU and **[NATO]{.underline}**, [the]{.underline}
**[lower]{.underline}** [the likelihood of military use]{.underline} of
force [in the Baltic Sea region]{.underline}.

Each state is first and foremost dependent on its own will and ability
to assert its security. But [all states depend on]{.underline}
**[cooperation]{.underline}** [with others]{.underline}, [**especially**
in the case of a potential conflict with]{.underline} a country like
**[Russia]{.underline}**. This also applies to the militarily
non-aligned states Finland and Sweden.

Sweden and Finland are now preparing for being able to give and receive
support in crises, from each other, "beyond peace". No other partnership
than that of Finland or Sweden has closer cooperation with NATO. The two
non-aligned states also have special cooperation agreements with the
United States and are increasingly participating in increasingly
large-scale exercises with the NATO states.

[During]{.underline} President **[Trump's]{.underline}** [four
years]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} **[transatlantic
link]{.underline}** [has been]{.underline} **[weakened]{.underline}**.
We have had a situation where [not only]{.underline}
**[Russia]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[China]{.underline}** [but
also the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
have [sought to]{.underline} **[divide]{.underline}** EU and [NATO
member states]{.underline}. [There is]{.underline} **[good
hope]{.underline}** [that the link will be]{.underline}
**[strengthened]{.underline}** again [under]{.underline} President
**[Biden]{.underline}**.

The transatlantic link is important. [Security in the **Baltic
Sea**]{.underline} region [and the situation in the **North Atlantic**
and the **Arctic** are]{.underline} **[closely linked]{.underline}**.
And vice versa. One challenge is to build transatlantic cooperation
strong regardless of whoever is president of the United States. This
means that [European states need to take]{.underline} **[greater
responsibility]{.underline}** [for the strength of the transatlantic
link]{.underline}. The US, independently of the president, is said to
have increased its focus on the Pacific. But the US will still be
important for security in the Baltic Sea Region.

Unfortunately, [the]{.underline} **[cohesion]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} the EU and **[NATO]{.underline}** [is not as strong as
it should be in order to take greater responsibility for the
transatlantic link]{.underline}. The situation is perhaps most difficult
in the eastern Mediterranean. It is actually in the neighborhood of the
Baltic Sea region. Already the Crimean War in the 1850s showed this.

In the EU, the challenge is to defend the Union as a community of values
​​and at the same time develop a real capacity to act as a foreign and
security policy actor -- especially in the geographical proximity of the
Union.

[The situation is]{.underline} **[not at all hopeless]{.underline}** --
but it is demanding. EU and [NATO members]{.underline}, as well as NATO
partners, [in the Baltic Sea Region have **every reason**]{.underline}
[to contribute to a]{.underline} **[strong transatlantic
link]{.underline}** and to strong cohesion [between member states in
Europe]{.underline}.

Inevitably, [the security situation in the Baltic Sea]{.underline}
Region [and in its immediate neighborhood is]{.underline} **[most
important]{.underline}**, especially with regard to defense policy. The
[lack of cohesion]{.underline} in a larger context **[only
underlines]{.underline}** [this relationship]{.underline}.

Most Likely To Begin", July 20^th^,
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-the-baltic-states-are-where-nuclear-war-most-likely-17044>\]

While **[[nuc]{.mark}lear weapons could potentially be [use]{.mark}d in
any number of future warfighting scenarios, there are multiple reasons
to suspect that [the greatest danger]{.mark} exists with regard to
[the]{.mark} three [Baltic s]{.mark}tates. Here are eight of those
reasons]{.underline}**.

First, both **[[Washington and Moscow assign high strategic
significance]{.mark} to the future disposition of the Baltic
states]{.underline}**. **[From Moscow\'s perspective, the three states
are located close to the centers of Russian political and military
power, and therefore are a potential base for devastating
attacks]{.underline}**. For instance, the distance between Lithuania\'s
capital of Vilnius and Moscow is less than 500 miles \-- a short trip
for a supersonic aircraft. **[From Washington\'s perspective, failure to
protect the Baltic states from Russian aggression could lead to the
unraveling of America\'s most important alliance]{.underline}**.

Second, **[[Washington has been]{.mark} very [public about]{.mark} it
[commitment]{.mark} to the Baltic states]{.underline}**. For instance,
**[in 2014 President Obama stated during a visit to Estonia that defense
of the three countries\' capitals was \"just as important as the defense
of Berlin and Paris and London]{.underline}**.\" That is an
extraordinary assertion considering that the population of metropolitan
London (about 8 million) is greater than that of all three Baltic states
combined (about 6 million), and that the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea
is so close to the Russian heartland.

### Impacts \-\-- Cohesion k Deterrence

#### Strict capabilities aren't enough for COMPLETE Russian deterrence \-\-- Russia can collapse deterrence by creating openings in NATO disagreements \-\-- Cohesion is the only way to ensure Deterrence

Chart removed for brevity The direct comparison between the **[military
capabilities of Russia and NATO]{.underline}** indicates that there
**[is no real threat in terms of quantitative or qualitative advantage
in Russia's favour.]{.underline}** On the contrary, **[NATO is in the
lead]{.underline}**, **[with a huge advantage]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}** both **[equipment and personnel]{.underline}**
**[as well as tech]{.underline}**nology, **[quality and
quantity]{.underline}**. **[However, there are areas in favour of
Russia]{.underline}**. These include **[WRE]{.underline}**
(radio-electronic warfare), **[aviation and air defence capabilities,
radar systems]{.underline}** as well as nuclear carriers and weapons.
Needless to mention other types of mass destruction weapons which,
according to the International Humanitarian Law of Armed Conflict (IHL),
ought to cease to exist, whereas Russia is highly likely to possess them
(chemical weapons were used in counter-terrorism operations and special
combat operations). Over the past two decades, **[the Russian defence
industry has developed, researched and introduced dozens of
radio-electronic warfare systems capable of disrupting and completely
immobilizing most of the forces in the area]{.underline}**s of land, air
and water. Russian technologies are effective at fighting aircrafts,
cruise missiles, radars, conventional missiles and unmanned aircrafts.
The latest implemented system is the Palantin system, which has been
deployed in the Kaliningrad Oblast and Crimea. This system is able to
disrupt the operation of AWACS at a distance of 250 km. Probably, it is
also able to disrupt all radio, GPS and mobile systems as well as create
the so-called apparent targets that mask the correct flight paths of
projectiles fired from the Iskander launcher. Thus, combating and
destroying Iskander missiles have become even more difficult. Moreover,
the system also functions as a reconnaissance platform (Cranny-Evans
2019; Hodges et al. 2019). The deployment of Iskander and Krasucha
(Gawęda 2015), as well as Palantin and aeronautical defence systems in
the Kaliningrad Oblast and Crimea, including the S-300 and S-400, create
strong Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) nodes with the simultaneous
capability to strike by means of airborne and land forces within the
depth of their practical impact range (A2/AD nodes). Another threat
worth noting, **[particularly important for NATO Eastern Wall states, is
Russia's conduct of operations which cannot be immediately repelled by
the Alliance due to their little scale]{.underline}**. **[They take
place in the form of quick, limited or offensive operations giving
Russia the advantage of "facts made"]{.underline}** and allowing it to
join into the peace talks from that position. Figure 4 presents the
summary of the estimated military capabilities, presented earlier in
individual innovation trends, of the Russian Federation's Armed Forces
in Europe at the end of 2019. It illustrates the deployment of the
Strategic Connected Commands, the army and corpses as well as
"inaccessible areas" and potential targets to be attacked in the event
of a conflict (air bases, airports and radar systems). It is worth
noting that almost the entire area of Poland is an anti-access zone
(A2/AD) (Gawęda 2018), which means that **[any allied defence support
from the air, at least in the first phase of a conflict, will be very
difficult.]{.underline}** Operations of the Polish aviation and
capability to command them also seem highly problematic. Unfortunately,
that confirms the likelihood of limited offensive capabilities as
described above. \*\*Chart removed\*\* **[Russia's significant asset
is]{.underline}** also the fact **[that it constitutes a single entity
in contrast to NATO]{.underline}** whose forces, which guarantee the
security of Central and Eastern European states, are distributed
throughout the world (including the US and Canada). **[Thus, the
distance gives Russia a big advantage]{.underline}**. The **[USA, being
the major pillar of NATO, have several sensitive security spots and,
therefore, have to operate on many levels]{.underline}**, not just
watching over their own national and NATO's interests, but also, in
particular, European states neighbouring with Russia. Moreover, **[the
distance and response time create problems, while Russia has the freedom
to choose the time and space to provoke and attack]{.underline}**.
**[However, it is not the military threat that is the most dangerous for
NATO]{.underline}**. **[The main threat are the attempts made by Russia
to bring individual member states into conflict with each other in order
to break down NATO's cohesion]{.underline}**. **[Success of such
attempts could create a space for Russia to undertake possible military
actions]{.underline}**. The tools provided by the supplemented Gerasimov
doctrine entitle Russia to use all methods and measures of combat such
as: pre-emptive attacks, impacts on civilians and administration centres
(psychological and information operations), as well as the use of
nuclear weapons. In other terms, it entitles Russia to wage a total war
at a convenient time and place.

Summing up the provisions of the consecutive **[[NATO
Summits]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the declarations in Brussels of 2018,
it can be concluded that they **[[were crucial to the strategy pursued
by NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** nowadays. **[[The Alliance's new command
structure has become more suited for undertaking effective joint defence
operations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Definitely, assessing the consecutive
provisions, it can be stated that by introducing the standby initiative,
**[[NATO has become capable of putting into operation a greater number
of troops almost instantaneously.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[The
Alliance's forward-looking presence]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Central
and Eastern Europe **[[has also been modified, which should translate
into a major increase in the Alliance's defence
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the event of potential enemy
aggression (Graf 2018). The most recent **[[NATO
Summit]{.underline}]{.mark}** in London of December 2019 **[[reaffirmed
the Alliance's unity and commitment to Article 5]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of the Washington Treaty stating that an attack on one ally would be
considered an attack on all. "In difficult times, we are stronger as an
Alliance, and our citizens are safer. Our bond and mutual commitment
guarantee our freedoms, our values and our security for 70 years to
come. We are working to ensure that NATO guarantees these freedoms,
values and security for future generations".---The Alliance's
declaration proclaims.Footnote17 The leaders reaffirmed that NATO
guarantees security and fundamental human rights as well as the rule of
law on the territory of the Member States for the people living there.
"**[[Solidarity, unity and cohesion are the fundamental principles of
our Alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[As we are working together to
prevent conflicts and preserve peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**, NATO
remains the foundation of our collective defence and the basic forum for
consultation and security decisions among the allies. We reaffirm the
lasting transatlantic relationship between Europe and North America, the
observance of the objectives and principles of the United Nations
Charter and our solemn commitment as set out in Article 5 of the
Washington Treaty that an attack on one Ally will be considered an
attack on all of us"---they reaffirmed in the declaration. Most
importantly for Poland and the Baltic states, **[[NATO leaders agreed on
the updated defence plans for Poland and the Member
States]{.underline}]{.mark}**. They also expressed their criticism of
Russia's aggressive actions (Gotkowska and Szymański 2017).Footnote18

### Impacts \-\-- Cohesion k Taiwan War

#### NATO cohesion spurred by Ukraine and Russia prevents Chinese invasion of Taiwan

**Feng 3/9/22**

(John, "China Is Learning Lessons From West\'s United Response to
Russia," pg online @
<https://www.newsweek.com/china-learning-lessons-wests-united-response-russia-ukraine-invasion-1686259>
//um-ef)

**[[China is watching the West]{.underline}]{.mark}**\'s collective
response to Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}**
is **[[learning lessons that]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[may change
its]{.underline}]{.mark}** own **[[calculations]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[as]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[it seeks to annex
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according to senior officials in
Washington and London. When the threat of economic sanctions failed to
deter Vladimir Putin and the first of Russia\'s 150,000 troops began
pouring into Ukrainian territory on February 24, Taiwan became a
trending topic as **[[observers feared]{.underline}]{.mark}** China\'s
President **[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}** Jinping **[[would be emboldened
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** make good on his vow to **[[capture
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** democratic **[[island]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of 23.5 million people. However, as Putin\'s forces failed to achieve
their blitzkrieg goals and the war entered its second week, the thinking
changed. Ukraine\'s leaders remained in Kyiv; its armed forces fought
back and ordinary civilians joined the resistance. **[[A galvanized
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the early effects of the West\'s
unprecedented punishment on Russia\'s economy began to **[[give China
watchers pause]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Taiwan\'s Foreign Minister Joseph
Wu called the Ukrainian resistance an inspiration for the Taiwanese
people. Taipei joined several Asian governments in imposing export
controls on Russia and landed on Moscow\'s list of \"unfriendly\"
countries this week. Russia\'s forces continue their march toward
Ukraine\'s capital and may eventually achieve their military objectives
even as political goals---regime change and the submission of its
public---remain out of reach. But the events of the past days have
already made China more reluctant to invade Taiwan than just several
months ago, Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, told
the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. \"The view is both that
**[[it is likely to reinforce China\'s perspective on the seriousness
with which we would approach]{.underline}]{.mark}** an infringement on
**[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[and in the unity that they\'ve
seen between Europe and]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, particularly in enacting sanctions,\"
she said. \"Not just that unity, but the impact of those sanctions I
think are both things that are critical to their calculus and something
that will be interesting for us to see how they learn those lessons.\"
In her opening remarks, Haines said
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**---\"an unparalleled
priority\"---**[[would prefer \"coerced unification that avoids armed
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" The Chinese government has been
working to isolate Taiwan and undermine its elected leaders for years,
she said. \"At the same time, Beijing is preparing to use military force
if it decides this is necessary.\" In answer to a similar question, CIA
Director William Burns said he \"would not underestimate President Xi
and the Chinese leadership\'s determination with regard to Taiwan.\"
However, Burns said **[[Beijing has been \"surprised and unsettled\"
by]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[difficulties]{.underline}]{.mark}**
the **[[Russians]{.underline}]{.mark}** have **[[encountered in
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}**. \"Everything **[[from the strength of
the Western reaction,]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the way in which
Ukrainians have fiercely resisted,\" he said. \"I think **[[there\'s an
impact on the Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark}** calculus **[[with regard to
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, who heads the
Pentagon\'s Defense Intelligence Agency, told lawmakers at the
Russia-focused hearing that Taiwan and Ukraine were \"two different
things completely.\" He then hinted at the considerable U.S. military
presence in Asia. \"I also believe that our deterrence posture in the
Pacific puts a very different perspective on all of this,\" said
Berrier. \"We do know that \[**[[China\] is watching very, very
carefully]{.underline}]{.mark}** what happens and how this plays out.\"
At a similar briefing of the U.K.\'s Foreign Affairs Select Committee on
Monday, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Beijing \"does not want
to associate too closely\" with Russia\'s new status as a \"global
pariah.\" She left little doubt that **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** was
**[[set]{.underline}]{.mark}**ting **[[a precedent with its united
response]{.underline}]{.mark}** and **[sending a message to
China]{.underline}** in the process. \"There\'s also the issue of the
importance of showing strength as NATO,\" Truss said, \"because **[[the
rest of the world will be watching,]{.underline}]{.mark}** including
China, on how **[[the West]{.underline}]{.mark}** continues to
respond.\" \"Of course, **[[if we see a weak
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[that is likely to embolden

#### US-China nuclear war over Taiwan likely and causes extinction -- deterrence and no first use don't apply

Taiwan and the Prospects for War Between China and America, The
Diplomat,

For the United States and its allies and partners in Asia, **[[China's
aggressive efforts]{.mark} to assert questionable claims in the South
and East China Sea, enforce a disputed Air Defense Identification Zone
(ADIZ), build the rocket/missile and naval [capabilities]{.mark} needed
[to invade Taiwan,]{.mark} and build a substantial ballistic missile
capability all work to create a situation where conflict between the
U.S. and the PRC could occur and [rapidly escalate]{.mark}. Given that
American political and military leaders have a poor understanding of
Chinese ambitions and]{.underline}** particularly their opaque
**[nuclear thinking]{.underline}**, there is ample reason to be
concerned that **[a future conflict could escalate to a limited nuclear
conflict]{.underline}**. Thus, it is worth taking a look at the PRC with
an eye toward offering insight into Chinese motivation and thinking when
it comes to how a possible **[[crisis over Taiwan]{.mark} could
[escalate to]{.mark} the use of [nuclear weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Chinese Capabilities In their latest estimate, Hans M. Kristensen and
Robert S. Norris assess that the Second Artillery Corps possesses forty
long-range nuclear missiles that can strike the United States if fired
from China's eastern seaboard and an additional twenty that could hit
Hawaii and Alaska. The challenge for China, is reaching the East Coast
-- home to the nation's capital and largest economic centers. To
overcome this challenge China is also developing its JL-2
submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) which is a sea-based variant
of the DF-31 land-mobile long-range missile that will go to sea on
Jin-class submarines. China may also be developing a new mobile missile,
the DF-41, which will carry multiple warheads, giving the Chinese a way
to potentially defeat an American ballistic missile defense system. It
is worth noting that the quantity, though not the quality, of China's
nuclear arsenal is only limited by its dwindling stock of weapons grade
plutonium. This raises the question; to what end is China developing and
deploying its nuclear arsenal? Chinese Motivation The textbook answer is
straightforward. China seeks a secure second (retaliatory) strike
capability that will serve to deter an American first strike. As China
argues, it has a "no-nuclear-first policy" which makes its arsenal
purely defensive -- while its other capabilities such as cyber are
offensive. Potential nuclear adversaries including Russia, India, and
the United States are fully aware that China's investment in advanced
warheads and ballistic missile delivery systems bring Delhi, Moscow,
and, soon, Washington within reach of the "East Wind." While not a
nuclear peer competitor to either Russia or the U.S., China is rapidly
catching up as it builds an estimated 30-50 new nuclear warheads each
year. While American leaders may find such a sentiment unfounded, the
**[[PRC has a strong fear that the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [**[will use its nuclear arsenal as a
tool to]{.underline}**]{.mark} blackmail [(**[coerce)
China]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[into taking or not taking a number of
actions that are against its interests. China's fears are not unfounded.
Unlike China]{.underline}**, the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[maintains an ambiguous use-policy in order
to provide maximum flexibility.]{.underline}** As declassified
government documents from the 1970s clearly show, the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates certainly **[planned
to use overwhelming nuclear force early in a European conflict with the
Soviet Union]{.underline}**. Given American nuclear superiority and its
positioning of ballistic missile defenses in Asia, ostensibly to defend
against a North Korean attack, **[China sees its position and ability to
deter the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[as
vulnerable]{.underline}**. Possible Scenario While there are several
scenarios where conflict between the United States and China is
possible, some analysts believe that a **[[conflict over Taiwan remains
the most likely place where the PRC and the U.S. would come to
blows]{.mark}. Beijing is aware that any coercive action on its part to
force Taiwan to accept its political domination could incur the wrath of
the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. **[To prevent the
U.S. from intervening in the region, China will]{.underline}** certainly
turn to its anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) **[strategy]{.underline}**,
beginning with non-lethal means and non-lethal threats **[to
discourage]{.underline}** the **[American public from supporting the use
of force in support of Taiwan]{.underline}**. If thwarted in its initial
efforts to stop Chinese aggression against Taiwan, the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[may be tempted to
resort to stronger measures and attack mainland China. A [kinetic
response to a cyber-attack]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for example, although
an option, **[would very likely [lead to escalation]{.mark} on the part
of the Chinese. Given the regime's relative weakness and the probability
that American attacks]{.underline}** (cyber and conventional) **[on
China will include strikes against PLA command and
control]{.underline}** (C2) **[nodes]{.underline}**, which mingle
conventional and nuclear C2, the **[Chinese may escalate [to]{.mark} the
[use of a nuclear weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}** (against a U.S. carrier
in China's self-declared waters for example) **[as a means of forcing
de-escalation]{.underline}**. In the view of China, **[[such a strike
would not be a violation of its no-first-use policy because the strike
would occur in sovereign Chinese waters]{.underline}]{.mark}**, thus
**[making the use of nuclear weapons a defensive act. [Since Taiwan is a
domestic matter,]{.mark} any [U.S. intervention would be]{.mark} viewed
as [an act of aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This, in the minds of
the Chinese, makes the United States an outside aggressor, not China. It
is also important to remember that nuclear weapons are an asymmetric
response to American conventional superiority. **[Given that China is
incapable of executing and sustaining a conventional military campaign
against the continental U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates,
**[China would clearly have an asymmetry of interest and capability with
the United States -- far more is at stake for China than]{.underline}**
it is **[for]{.underline}** the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. In essence, **[the only effective option in
retaliation for a successful U.S. conventional campaign on Chinese soil
is the nuclear one]{.underline}**. Without making too crude a point, the
nuclear option provides more bang for the buck, or yuan. **[Given that
mutually assured destruction]{.underline}** **[[(MAD) is not part of

## Euro War Impacts 

### Impacts \-\-- Euro/Russia War Escalates

#### WWIII 

Adrian **Bonenberger 17**, Vocativ Staff, Where Could The European Cold
War Go Hot Again? Think a war in Europe won\'t happen? Here\'s a look at
the issues most likely to spur a military confrontation, 1-27-17,
<http://www.vocativ.com/397190/europe-cold-war-military-conflict/>

Since 2014, however, and the West's failure to protect an avowedly
pro-European Ukraine, it has become increasingly popular to describe the
West's relationship with Russia as a new Cold War. Reading the
headlines, it certainly seems like **[Moscow]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[Europe]{.underline}** **[are one badly-aimed
missile]{.underline}** or bomb **[away from World War
III.]{.underline}** As political realities in the US and abroad are
challenged, what are the lines or issues most likely to lead to war in
Europe? Imperial Russia By A Different Name One variable that seems
constant right now is Russia. Whether one sees things from Russia's
perspective (wherein Russia is surrounded by hostile neighbors intent on
its destruction) or those of its nearest neighbors (which see Russia as
an aggressive and expansive imperial bully), Russia's actions are
indisputable. It has invaded and occupied portions of Ukraine and
Georgia. It has countenanced cyberattacks on Estonia, Ukraine (which
included the first deaths attached to cyberwarfare), the U.S., Georgia,
Azerbaijan and NATO. It is pursuing a long game to undermine and
destabilize any and all political alliances that do not include it, as
well as those that do include it. The weaker everyone else is, the
greater the room for Russian opportunism. Russia has also taken the side
of America's primary antagonists in the Middle East. This has made it
the friend of isolationists, nationalists, and left-wingers who
(paradoxically, given Russia's own actions) oppose an American and
European hegemony, backed by the increasingly questionable threat of
military intervention. Whether it is lashing out in righteous
self-defense or as part of an unethical attempt to grow larger and more
powerful at the expense of its smaller and weaker neighbors, there is no
question that Russia is looking to expand its brand. The Return Of
Nationalism **[Across Europe]{.underline}**, explicit **[nationalism is
on the rise]{.underline}** at levels unseen since the early 20th
century. While hard to quantify, the success of so-called
"**[populist]{.underline}**" political **[parties with]{.underline}**
**[nationalist agendas]{.underline}** **[suggests]{.underline}** **[a
growing dissatisfaction]{.underline}** with NATO, the EU, and the U.S..
Over the last two years, far-right parties have won political power,
gained credibility, or advanced substantial nationalist agendas in
Poland (Law and Justice), Hungary (Jobbik), Romania (the recent founding
of a new nationalist party) Austria, Italy (rejection of judicial and
legal reform), the U.S. (Trump/Alt-Right), Germany (Alternative for
Germany), UK (Brexit), France (Le Pen's National Front) and others.
**[Nationalism overlaps]{.underline}** well **[with]{.underline}**
**[Russia's agenda]{.underline}**, because it erodes federalism---the
idea that different people in different countries could lay aside tribal
instincts like linguistic or ethnic affinities to cooperate. **[This
makes it easier for Russia to project power]{.underline}** at a local or
regional level without sacrificing much in the way of money or manpower.
Even nationalists like those in Poland and Germany who tend to dislike
Russians for a variety of actual and perceived historical slights seem
to receive financial support from Russia. This seems based on the
principle that a Europe of many countries will be less unified in
opposing Russia's agenda. In principle, those countries that have a
strong nationalist political voice end up pursuing policies that
strengthen (relatively) Russia. For people who believe that NATO, the
U.S., or the EU are too strong, that may not be a particularly
troublesome issue. Immigration There are at least three different types
of national responses to the question of (largely Middle Eastern and
African) immigration into Europe. The first draws on 20th century legal
precedents guaranteeing humans fair and dignified treatment regardless
of their national background. This response, exemplified by Germans and
Scandinavians, tends to view immigrants as refugees fleeing war or
economic oppression for which Europe or the West have some kind of
responsibility given the global economy. Nations like Germany, Denmark
and Sweden are considered among the most generous to refugees. Germany
especially has embraced modern attitudes toward immigration, in the wake
of its catastrophic spasm of ethnic cleansing during WWII. Other
countries with colonial legacies have maintained generous post-colonial
policies. Absent active restitution, countries like France, the UK,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Portugal---any country that
had its finger in the exploitative pie that was 17th-20th century
Africa, South America, and Asia---provide expedited or dual-citizenship
options for many people living in countries formerly touched by European
sails and soldiers. This is similar to the posture of countries like
Germany. It also results in specific ethnic and religious traffic
flowing from the formerly colonized to the colonizer. A critical
difference between the experience of countries like Germany and those
like France or the UK (for example) is that Germany's posture toward
immigration and citizenship embraces an assumed modern, cosmopolitan
future, and exists without any natural enemies safe for the white
supremacists and Neo-Nazis who nearly destroyed Europe during World War
II (until recently, not a credible source of dissidence). Colonialism
did not die easily in the UK, France, or other similar countries, and
much military blood and cash was expended in attempting to keep colonial
holdings within the fold. Groups nostalgic for former imperial glory
tend to see immigration as an affront to national dignity, beyond being
unwise policy. Groups that evaluate immigration through the lens of
colonial nostalgia are not Nazis or necessarily white supremacists,
though the practical implications of their attitudes end up being
similar enough to warrant comparison. Finally, there are nations in
Central and Eastern Europe whose attitudes on immigration were shaped by
their experiences in WWI and WWII, as well as life behind the Iron
Curtain. Ethnic cleansing and population movements by the Nazis and the
Kremlin-led USSR left countries with the idea that ethnic homogeneity
was an absolute good, and ethnic diversity was an existential threat.
During the first part of its life, the USSR viewed ethnicity as
threatening to the ideal of a classless society, although that slowly
devolved into a view that non-Russian ethnicities were dangerous. This
is not to diminish or excuse a powerful racial element in resistance to
immigration, simply to frame it in the context of places that
experienced the Holocaust firsthand, often actively participating in it
in a way that ended up shaping every subsequent generation. Religion The
European immigration "crisis" is complicated by the issue of religion.
There are two key fault lines at play here: Orthodox versus
non-Orthodox, and Christian versus Islam. Countries like Germany,
Hungary, Croatia, Poland and Slovakia tend to be Catholic. The primary
factor in considering their political preferences is their experience
with Soviet-style governance, wherein Orthodox Christianity was a proxy
for Russian intelligence agencies, and Catholicism was part of
resistance to totalitarianism and Russian nationalism. Orthodox
countries tend to be pro-Russian: Greece, Bulgaria Macedonia and Serbia
all share religious and cultural affinity for one another, as well as
Russia. They tend to be hostile to the idea of immigration from the
Middle East and Africa based on religious grounds, given the
relationship between church and state. This has been the case for
centuries. Religious constituencies within all European countries tend
to view the EU's stance toward religion with skepticism, and see efforts
to resettle non-Christians within their borders as direct attacks on
both their Christianity and ethnicity. Still, there are substantial
differences between Orthodox countries (which tend to be pro-Russian)
and Catholic countries that spent time behind the Iron Curtain (which
tend to be anti-Russian). Countries Formerly Occupied Or Annexed By
Russia Polish voters empowered the "Law and Order" party based partly on
its promises to block non-Christian (most importantly, Islamic)
immigration and the expansion of EU power at the expense of Polish
autonomy. At the same time, Poland is among the most staunch and
enthusiastic NATO member-states. Its army is the fourth largest in
Europe behind Russia, Ukraine, and France. Its chief foreign policy
priorities have nothing to do with Middle Eastern immigration, and
everything to do with preventing a repeat of the 20th century, where
Poland was occupied by Russian soldiers on three separate occasions, and
forced to adopt Soviet governance at bayonet-point. Similar in their
opposition to recent Russian militancy to Poland are the Baltic States,
as well as countries like Sweden, Finland, and Romania. The fate of the
Baltics and Finland were determined as part of agreements between Nazi
Germany and the USSR to enforce German and Russian "spheres of
influence" according to Hitler and Stalin's vision for Europe. The
Baltics were made into independent SSRs within the USSR, while Sweden
maintained its independence. Finland was invaded and had large portions
of territory annexed into Russia, and Romania was partitioned before and
after WWII, first by agreement between the USSR and the Nazis, and later
by conquest. Within the Baltics, anti-Russian attitudes are tempered by
former Russian citizens of the USSR who lost their national standing
when the USSR collapsed. This is most conspicuous in Latvia, but is also
true for Lithuania and Estonia. Broadly speaking, any country with an
ethnic or Russian-speaking population that borders Russia or was part of
the USSR's sphere of influence. It is a visible reminder of Russia's de
facto colonization of other nations within the USSR, the consequences of
which---the current war in Ukraine, as well as the past war in
Georgia---explain why national security is among the most urgent
priorities for these countries now (satirically represented here, though
more recent developments suggest that Germany would remain part of the
EU and France perhaps would not). Another way of stating this European
dynamic would be thus: countries with no direct experience of the USSR
tend not to see Russia as an imminent military threat. Those with direct
experience of the USSR (and which therefore have vocal Russian-speaking
minorities as viable political entities) see Russia as an existential
threat. Economic Ideals Those **[countries that have had difficulty
adjusting]{.underline}** their **[economies]{.underline}** to meet the
EU's standards, **[or]{.underline}** which **[have not
prospered]{.underline}** during their time in the EU
**[have]{.underline}** **[become]{.underline}** powerful passive
**[allies of]{.underline}** **[Russia]{.underline}**.
**[Greece]{.underline}**, **[Italy]{.underline}**,
**[Spain]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[Bulgaria]{.underline}**
have all **[come to view sanctions on Russia as damaging]{.underline}**
**[to their]{.underline}** own **[economies]{.underline}**. **[They view
competition]{.underline}** with Russia **[as harmful to their
economic]{.underline}** **[interests]{.underline}**, either "someone
else's problem" or somehow the fault of the U.S.. The EU's structure
(exposed during Greece's economic crisis of 2012) does not privilege
every country equally, nor is it designed to---its design offers
benefits to those countries that are best able to leverage Europe's many
markets and industries. Those in favor of the EU would stress that each
country that joined the EU did so transparently and freely, and expected
to benefit from its structure by investing time and energy---these
**[people]{.underline}** would **[say that countries failing
to]{.underline}** **[maximize]{.underline}** their **[income within the
EU have themselves to blame]{.underline}**. **[Those opposed to the
EU]{.underline}** (many Greek nationalists) **[believe that it is an
exploitative system.]{.underline}** Energy Dependence The final factor
that determines a country's relationship with Europe versus Russia is
its dependence on Russian oil and gas. After the fall of the USSR, some
countries that had existed behind the Iron Curtain were able to maintain
privileged relationships with Russian energy producers. Dependence on
the Russia used to be the single greatest European weakness, and still
is for certain countries (most conspicuously Hungary, which goes out of
its way to propitiate Russia, but also other Central European powers as
well as Ukraine itself). Lately, though, low oil prices, longtime pushes
for energy independence using renewable sources, as well as the opening
of alternate energy markets in the Middle East have made it increasingly
difficult for Russia to monopolize Europe's energy, and therefore have
reduced its political influence there. This places Russia in a serious
bind, as the US's development of new technology to access additional
energy reserves means that as the price of oil and gas rises, it becomes
profitable for it to reenter the energy market---meaning European
countries will never again be entirely dependent on Russia for energy.
**[The Prospect of War]{.underline}** Although there are many fault
lines that could lead to conflict, it still seems unlikely that European
war will spread west from Ukraine. Still, **[it's]{.underline}**
**[worth paying attention to]{.underline}** these various
**[collisions]{.underline}** **[between]{.underline}** **[Russian and
European countries]{.underline}**. No **[century in history has seen a
Europe free from war]{.underline}**---**[the question is always one of
degree]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[intensity]{.underline}**.
So far, **[the 21st century]{.underline}** still **[has all
the]{.underline}** **[elements in place for]{.underline}** a truly
**[epic struggle]{.underline}** **[between European countries and
Russia]{.underline}**. And **[this conflict,]{.underline}** unlike those
of the last century, **[may be adjudicated by nuclear

Escalation of War (15)

Increasing, enlarging, or intensifying the nature, magnitude, or
parameters of a war. Escalation may entail an increase in troops,
additional third party involvement, the use of deadlier weapons, or a
change in political or military objectives. Escalation may be likened to
a ladder, in that the level of coercion and force tends to increase as
the war becomes more costly and uncertain. In a limited war, states can
employ sundry military measures to challenge one another's resolve and
capabilities. in such conflicts, the goal of escalation may be to defeat
or force the surrender of an adversary, or to mete out increased
punishment to pressure a foe to negotiate or terminate the action that
originally precipitated the conflict. **[In a limited war, military
objectives]{.underline}** tend to **[escalate rapidly. In a nuclear
confrontation]{.underline}**, however, the stakes are far
greater---**[rapid escalation]{.underline}** must be avoided, as it
**[could spell instant]{.underline}** disaster or
**[extinction]{.underline}**. In a nuclear age, most experts believe
there is no such thing as a "limited" nuclear war. For example**[, if
one side initiated a war in Europe, even with conventional weapons, it
is highly likely that it would escalate inevitably to a
global]{.underline} strategic [nuclear war, since neither side would be
willing to accept defeat in such a critical arena]{.underline}**. See

## Ukraine Impacts

### Impacts \-\-- Ukraine win k prevent Russia Invade

#### Ukraine can win \-\-- that's critical to prevent Russian aggression vs. NATO

**Hooker 7/20/22**

Special Assistant to the US President and Senior Director for Europe and
Russia with the National Security Council, "Ukraine can win," pg online

//um-ef)

In all likelihood, the appetite for international aid and support for
Ukraine would wane over time, abetted by declining interest in sanctions
against Russia. In this circumstance, the prospects for eventual EU and
NATO membership for what remained of Ukraine would also fade. Instead,
Ukraine would fall inexorably into the Russian orbit. Nor would "peace"
follow. As Putin has stated many times**[, Russia has larger foreign
policy ambitions that extend far beyond Ukraine]{.underline}**. It is
certainly true that as matters now stand, Ukraine probably cannot "win,"
if victory is defined as recovering all internationally recognized
Ukrainian territory and dealing a decisive defeat to Russia in the
field. **[Western financial and security assistance has helped Ukraine
to inflict heavy losses on the Russian military in the air, at sea, and
on land. However, conscious Western policy decisions to withhold
airpower, self-propelled artillery, long range precision fires and main
battle tanks from Ukraine are having the intended effect]{.underline}**.
Without them, Ukraine cannot transition to offensive operations and
drive the invaders out. Almost certainly, the West has collectively
determined not to "humiliate" Putin. When Latvia is providing more
military equipment to Ukraine than France, Italy and Germany, the true
intentions of major European states emerge powerfully. **[The logic of
this approach, however, collapses when confronted with the strong
probability of further Russian aggression on NATO
territory]{.underline}**. When that happens, there will be much
hand-wringing about "missed opportunities" and "miscalculations." It is
far better to confront the threat now while Russia is reeling from high
casualties, depleted stocks of high-tech munitions, low morale, severe
losses among senior commanders, and inferior generalship. **[A careful
assessment suggests that given essential capabilities, Ukraine can
win]{.underline}**. In terms of manpower, President Zelenskyy can
eventually put up to a million trained soldiers in the field, despite
heavy losses to date. This is far more than Russia can likely generate.

**[The recognition of Russia's broader strategic ambitions beyond

will be tempted towards either vertical escalation]{.underline}**, by
using weapons of mass destruction **[in Ukraine, or horizontal

to make implicit and explicit nuclear threats to coerce
NATO,]{.underline}** such as Putin's announcement that Russia will

**[while also raising the threat of hybrid warfare against NATO

cyberattack from Russian-based hackers and Putin is set to ruthlessly
exploit food and energy as weapons to coerce NATO states into stopping
support for Kyiv. **[NATO needs to mobilize for possible war by

grey-zone threats.]{.underline}** It also needs to boost the credibility
of its nuclear deterrence against Moscow. The naming of 'Operation

Embassy, Warsaw, Poland, "Forward Defense: Has NATO Finally Gotten the
Memo?," pg online @
<https://cepa.org/forward-defense-has-nato-finally-gotten-the-memo/>
//um-ef)

NATO's Madrid summit will consider (June 28-30) its most consequential
defense posture and readiness options since the Cold War. A paradigm
shift seems afoot, and robust forward defense along NATO's eastern front
is the top priority.

There is a growing transatlantic awareness that the NATO response after
Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine and illegal annexation of Crimea was
inadequate and has failed to stop Russian aggression against its
neighbors. While Russia has not yet attempted open military aggression
against alliance members, it is more frequently threatening to do so ---
most recently it officially menaced NATO ally Lithuania over its
enforcement of EU sanctions, while state-controlled media openly talked
of war. Russia meanwhile maintains a steady drumbeat of nuclear and
other saber-rattling in the borderlands and beyond.

Until Russia commenced its full-scale 2022 war on Ukraine, many Western
leaders had convinced themselves that its continued aggression and its
self-proclaimed revisionist mandate required only incremental responses.
An unofficial doctrine emerged; firstly, do not "antagonize" Russia too
much, coupled with, secondly, let's not invest too much on NATO's
eastern front (since no one wanted the expense of a second Cold War.)
Even a week before the invasion, many did not believe that Putin would
start a major war in the heart of Europe. These ideas and false
assumptions, particularly since 2014, have led the West to a strategic
situation unseen in Europe since World War II. Russia only understands
strength. It is a lesson the West is having to relearn, at speed.

The conflict is inflicting untold costs, both human and financial.
Estimates for humanitarian relief, war damage, and operations reach as
high as \$1 trillion. In comparison, the US Department of Defense spends
about \$25bn annually to maintain 175,000 American troops deployed
around the globe. That is more than the total number of troops in all 10
US Army divisions. Thus, war costs so far could fund the equivalent of
175,000 US troops on NATO's eastern front for 40 years and would deter
Russia from threatening NATO allies and attacking its neighbors.

NATO does not need that number of American troops on its eastern front,
but it does need to establish a 21st-century version of the Cold War
forward defense of Western Europe. During that period, the US maintained
hundreds of thousands of troops in Europe. In 1989, there were 250,000
American troops, just in Germany --- not to mention 55,000 British
troops in Rhine Army, with additional French, Canadian, Dutch, and
Belgian allies alongside. Add in the West German Army and almost a
million allied troops were toe-to-toe with the Russians in forward
defense (with more divisions ready to reinforce from Europe and North
America). The US Air Force (USAF) maintained four Fighter Wings, close
to the front in Germany, and six others around Europe. The US Navy had
no less than two separate fleets focused on Europe during the Cold War.

NATO's strong Forward Defense was instrumental in defeating Soviet
Russia. After the Cold War, NATO enlarged, and its "front line" shifted
eastwards, but Western allied forces did not. During the 1990s, there
was a sense that all was, and would remain, quiet on the eastern front.
The NATO-Russia Founding Act (NRFA) limited the Western troop presence
in the former Warsaw Pact nations of Central-East Europe (CEE.) US and
Western NATO allies mostly returned their divisions home, or
decommissioned them. By 2013, the last US Army tank departed Europe,
something celebrated as an "historic moment" Just a year later, in
another historic moment, American Army tanks returned to Europe after
Russia's first invasion of Ukraine. But even after this, Germany still
pointed to the NRFA as a key reason why NATO should take the minimalist
route on Kremlin aggression. The US pushed the alliance to bolster its
defenses, but not that hard; an indication of German sensitivities and
its desire to keep talking to Vladimir Putin. Meanwhile, Poland, the
Baltic states, and Romania were sounding the alarm, to little effect.

A simple recreation of allied forward defense as seen during the Cold
War is not what's called for today. Equally, it's clear that NATO's
unconvincing adjustments on its eastern perimeter since 2014 are not
getting the job done. Allies must upgrade the current, small tripwire
deployments and harden the Eastern Flank, using its determined allies in
Poland and Romania as regional bulwarks as the anchor.

Strong US leadership is essential. A respected senior allied leader told
this author: "The United States organized NATO for the United States to
'lead' NATO, there is no other option. Please lead!" Almost every ally
makes this fundamental point in this era of renewed great power
competition. The US cannot just be a nuclear backstop, or a cheerleader
on Europe's periphery. It must lead from the front with a strategy,
along with permanent troop commitments and capabilities to ensure robust
and credible deterrence.

The NATO Russia Founding Act must be formally scuttled.

Western allies must organize transatlantic schemes based on the
Lend-Lease Act and Marshall Plan not only for Ukraine but also for
vulnerable nations on the eastern front --- Poland, Romania, Lithuania,
Estonia, Latvia, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria
Hungary and NATO partners like Georgia and Moldova. These efforts must
focus on rapid modernization and Westernization of Eastern Flank
militaries; massive "no-strings" Western financial investments in the
infrastructure-development Three Seas Initiative (3SI). Importantly, the
3SI fosters energy resilience and military mobility for NATO.

The alliance must urgently update its Maritime Strategy (which is now
several years behind.) And, the US administration must organize a Black
Sea strategy, in coordination with allies, synchronized with the pending
2022 US National Security Strategy.

Permanent brigade-sized formations (with enabling units) should be
assigned to all eight of NATO's forward presence battle groups (these
are currently slightly larger than battalion-size formations, with about
1,000 troops) -- i.e., they are only tripwire forces.

Permanently assign the US Army V "Victory" Corps full Headquarters (HQ)
to Poland. Currently, the V Corps forward HQ is assigned to Poland,
separated from its main HQ, making V Corps less effective. The Corps
needs to be consolidated in one location, planning operations, and
working daily on allied readiness with Poland and regional allies.

Permanently assign a US heavy division to Poland, and a second US heavy
division to Romania. The US and NATO are fortunate to have such stalwart
allies and both are ready to help anchor the eastern front. They are
modernizing rapidly (though severe budget pressures mean the US and
Western NATO allies must assist.) Both are increasing defense spending
and force structure. Poland intends to become NATO's second-highest per
GDP defense spender (after the US.) Its already significant plans to
increase its armed forces rose again on June 27, when it was announced
personnel would increase to 400,000 from 150,000, but that and
associated equipment plans will take at least 10 years to implement. The
US and NATO can meanwhile help Poland and Romania (which is raising
defense spending by 25%) to develop highly capable divisions. There is
no better way to do this than to have a US division permanently on the
ground in these nations, building capabilities, "training as we fight"
and together providing real warfighting capabilities to NATO and its
entire eastern front.

Permanently assign a USAF fighter-wing to Poland to support the region.
Additionally, Western-NATO allies should permanently assign fighter
squadrons to the Baltic/Black Sea regions.

Upgrade NATO Baltic and Black Seas Air Policing missions to Air and
Missile Defense (AMD) missions, with new rules of engagement for allied
fighters, and robust ground AMD capabilities.

Increase the number of Standing NATO Maritime Groups (SNMGs) from two to
five. This will provide for 24/7, 365-day, NATO Baltic and Black Sea
maritime defense patrolling, and the ability to cover other SNMG
requirements in the Mediterranean and Atlantic. There are 29 US
warships, assigned to NATO's Maritime Command (MARCOM), and the US could
fill the five-SNMG requirement on its own. But that would detract from
other MARCOM responsibilities. Therefore, the US should provide up to
two SNMGs, while other NATO nations should provide the other three to
four SNMGS. The Montreux Convention limits deployments in the Black Sea,
but non-littoral NATO has never maximized its Black Sea patrolling
opportunities. That has allowed Russia to turn the Black Sea into a de
facto Russian Lake, and create a global food crisis, through its
blockade of Ukraine.

NATO must permanently position the necessary wartime stocks of
equipment, ammunition, spare parts, rations, and other logistics.

Faced with an alternative of an increasingly aggressive Russia
terrorizing its NATO neighbors, a robust forward defense on the eastern
front makes its own case and is worth the investment. It provides
credible deterrence with real warfighting capabilities. Most
importantly, it is the best way to avoid a ruinous future war.

What is **[the myth?]{.underline}** Russia's invasion of Ukraine in
February 2022 has reminded NATO that President Vladimir **[Putin sees
military aggression as a rational means to achieve his foreign policy
aims]{.underline}**. It has also triggered widespread discussion of the
implications **[if Russia were to]{.underline}** follow this with an
**[attack]{.underline}** on **[a NATO member state.]{.underline}**
**[The prevailing view is that this is highly unlikely]{.underline}**,
because Russia must realize the devastating implications of the entirety
of the Western alliance joining the conflict and inflicting intolerable
damage on Russia. However, **[this view is based on a number of
questionable premises]{.underline}**, and in fact **[a Russian attack on
a NATO member state should not be ruled out]{.underline}**. Who
advocates or subscribes to it? A wide range of political figures,
analysts and commentators have discounted the likelihood of a Russian
attack on a NATO member state. This is primarily because, in their view,
NATO's deterrent message of unity is strong, and Russia is fully
cognizant of the fact that an attack on one NATO member state would
inevitably bring the rest of the alliance into the conflict. Other
Western commentary suggests that there is no evident benefit to Russia
in an attack on the Baltic states or Poland. Russia, too, has added its
assurances that it has no hostile intent against NATO -- although these
assurances are now recognized as valueless, since the same promises were
made regarding Ukraine in the lead-up to the 2022 invasion. Indeed in
March 2022 Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, stated once again
that Russia had no plans to attack other countries, but in the same
interview also claimed that Russia had not attacked Ukraine. **[Why is
it wrong?]{.underline}** There are several reasons why it is incorrect
to assume that Russia would not attack NATO members. The first lies in
the term 'attack'. Ordinarily, this is understood as the 'armed attack'
specified in **[Article 5]{.underline}** of the North Atlantic Treaty --
implying an overt use of force which would clearly and unambiguously
breach the definitional threshold for armed conflict. However, **[this
narrow definition overlooks both the fact that many other forms of
coercion]{.underline}** have already been practised by Russia against
NATO member states in the sphere of warfare commonly referred to as
'hybrid', 'sub-threshold' or 'grey zone', and that Russia has already
used military assets to carry out actions against NATO member states
that are indistinguishable from those conducted during wartime. In 2014
Russia sent military intelligence officers to the Czech Republic and
Bulgaria to sabotage munitions depots. More recently, Russia has
persistently used its military electronic warfare assets to trigger
disruption in the Nordic and Baltic areas. In fact, the narrower sense
of 'armed attack' is one of the few ways in which Russia has not already
attacked NATO members. Russia has already used military assets to carry
out actions against NATO member states that are indistinguishable from
those conducted during wartime Second, **[the entire principle of NATO
deterrence rests on an interpretation of Article 5 which does not stand
up to close scrutiny]{.underline}**. Senior NATO figures and politicians
from member states focus on the part of Article 5 which states that an
attack on one NATO member state is to be considered an attack against
all of them. But this is ordinarily coupled with the assertion, or
assumption, that all other member states are obliged immediately to join
the conflict by contributing forces to aid the victim of aggression. Yet
this is not what Article 5 actually stipulates, and it is highly
probable that, unlike many Western politicians, Russia's military
planners have in fact read it. The actual text of Article 5 provides
plenty of leeway for any member state that might wish to avoid entering
a conflict with an aggressor. The requirement only to take the action
that each member state 'deems necessary... to restore and maintain'
security is far more vague than the clear and direct requirement to
support the victim of aggression that is ordinarily assumed. The
implication is that Russia might be unlikely to attack a NATO member
state if it were indeed convinced that this would trigger retaliation
from the rest of the alliance. But **[there are many circumstances in
which Moscow could make a calculated assessment that it could target an
individual country while ensuring through other means -- political,
diplomatic or subversive -- that one or more major NATO allies could be
effectively deterred from responding, or induced or persuaded not to
respond]{.underline}**. Third, **[the assessment that Russia would not
attack a NATO member state rests on the assumption that decision-makers
in Moscow are assessing their options using the same framework of
reality and rationality as the Euro-Atlantic community]{.underline}**.
**[However, both the shifting rationales for the invasion of Ukraine and
the counterproductive nature of the invasion itself show that this
should not be relied on]{.underline}**. **[Many of Russia's recent
actions have achieved the exact opposite of what they were intended to
do because of Moscow's faulty understanding of events and processes in
the outside world]{.underline}**. For example, Russia makes military
threats and launches military action in order to dissuade neighbours
from joining NATO -- with the only result being to demonstrate to those
neighbours precisely why they need to join. The most recent examples are
Finland and Sweden: the former a long-time exponent of stable relations
with Russia, and the latter a country that enjoyed military neutrality
for more than two centuries. Similarly, the possibility of misguided
actions by the Russian leadership in the future should not be ruled out
solely on the basis of what appears rational based on Western
assumptions and the Western understanding of recent history. Fourth,
President **[Putin has clearly laid out the extent of his ambition to
roll back history and the borders of the West]{.underline}**. He has set
out his task as correcting the 'catastrophic mistakes' of the end of the
Russian empire, **[and redrawing the international borders that he says
came about as a result of those errors]{.underline}**. **[But restoring
Russia's former imperial boundaries can only come at the expense of
those nations and peoples that were formerly dominated by Russia and now
live in independent sovereign states. That list includes NATO member
states]{.underline}**, such as Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and --
soon -- Finland. Given both Russia's and Putin's track record of
strategic patience and nurturing grievances, and widespread support
within the country for wars of reconquest, even military defeat in
Ukraine would only postpone, rather than deter, Russia's next attempt to
achieve Putin's vision. What is its impact on policy? The results of a
misguided default assumption that there will be no Russian attack on a
NATO member state are inimical to timely and appropriate preparation for
that eventuality. Paradoxically, t**[hroughout most of NATO's recent
history, failure to prepare adequately for conflict with Russia has
resulted not solely from the assumption that Russia did not intend to
attack, but also from the self-deterring idea that Russia could be
'provoked' into attacking through defensive preparations by
NATO.]{.underline}** Major European NATO allies therefore self-deterred
from doing anything which Russia described as provocative. NATO's
limited contribution to the security of the Baltic states and Poland,
the so-called 'enhanced forward presence' (eFP), came about only after
extensive wrangling over whether this might trigger a Russian attack --
a striking indication of the dominant position of Russian narratives
about the nature of the security threat in the region. Today, this same
pattern of assumptions has deterred a wide range of meaningful and
timely assistance to Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. Germany
in particular has shown extreme reluctance to provide weapons to
Ukraine, or even to allow third countries to do so, using the argument
that this -- rather than Russian intent -- could be the trigger for war
with NATO. In addition, despite widespread recognition of the key role
played by tactical nuclear weapons in Russian military doctrine, nuclear
deterrence policy, capabilities and decision-making processes have been
allowed to atrophy within NATO because of a preference to treat nuclear
use as 'unthinkable'. This is a highly dangerous assumption when Russia
devotes a great deal of thought and resources to the possibility of
nuclear use, in addition to extensively employing nuclear rhetoric for
intimidating the West. **[What would good policy look like? Preparations
by NATO nations for potential conflict with Russia cannot be premised on
the assumption that it will not happen]{.underline}**. The defence of
NATO nations need not be hostage to interpretations of Article 5. The
Joint Expeditionary Force -- a coalition of 10 like-minded northern
European states that share a similar viewpoint on the threat from Russia
-- provides a template for cooperative organizations that can respond to
aggression by Moscow without relying on support from every member of the
alliance. And the existence of NATO does not preclude regional defensive
alliances of this kind, tailored to the specific nature of the threat,
which varies across Europe. **[The forward presence of troops and assets
from major NATO allies in the front-line states is an essential element
for the conventional deterrence of Moscow]{.underline}** The forward
presence of troops and assets from major NATO allies in the front-line
states is an essential element for the conventional deterrence of
Moscow. Until now, initiatives such as eFP in the Baltic states and
Poland have been sufficient to deter an attack, by eliminating the
element of doubt as to whether other allies would respond. But **[the
new situation following the invasion of Ukraine demands forward-deployed
forces that are militarily as well as politically significant, in order
to offer deterrence of Moscow by denial in addition to the promise of
deterrence by punishment]{.underline}**. Overall, **[defensive
preparations by NATO must reflect the reality of a belligerent Russia
whose hostile intent is no longer in doubt]{.underline}**, **[and NATO's
forward presence in the eastern flank must become a robust forward
defence posture]{.underline}**.

If the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) did not exist today,
the United States would not seek to create it. In 1949, it made sense in
the face of a potential Soviet invasion to forge a bond in the North
Atlantic area among the United States, Canada, and the west European
states. Today, if the United States were starting from scratch in a
world of transnational threats, the **[debate]{.underline}** would be
**[over whether to follow liberal and neoconservative calls for an
alliance of democracies]{.underline}** without regard to geography or to
develop a great power concert envisioned by the realists to uphold the
current order. The United States is not, however, starting from scratch,
and **[NATO should not disappear. While the bonds across the Atlantic
may be frayed]{.underline}**, **[they are stronger than those tying the
United States to other parts of the world. Common history and values
matter]{.underline}**, as do the resources (both financial and military)
that Europe possesses. The **[NATO allies share a common interest in
preventing disruptions to the global economy]{.underline}**,
**[including attacks on freedom of navigation. As a community of
democracies]{.underline}**, the member states are **[threatened by
forces such as Islamic extremism and]{.underline}** the **[rise of
authoritarian states]{.underline}**. For the United States, **[the
alliance is a source of legitimacy for]{.underline}** actions in places
like Afghanistan. For Europe, **[NATO is a vehicle for projecting hard
power]{.underline}**. While **[NATO]{.underline}** alone cannot defend
against the range of threats facing the member states, it **[can serve
as the hub for American and European leaders to develop the ties with
other institutions and non-European countries]{.underline}** necessary
to provide for the common defense. For all its faults, **[NATO enables
the United States to partner with close democratic allies]{.underline}**
in ways that would be **[difficult without a formal
institution]{.underline}** that provides a headquarters and ready venue
for decision-making, as well as **[legitimacy and support for action
that ad hoc U.S.-led coalitions do not.]{.underline}** As has been true
since the fall of the Berlin Wall two decades ago, the United States
(and Europe) should want **[NATO]{.underline}** to succeed. After the
Cold War, the alliance dramatically redefined itself. In the 1990s, it
**[fostered stability across Europe]{.underline}** by beginning its
process of enlargement to the formerly communist east and by intervening
to stop genocide in the Balkans. In the 2000s, **[it broadened its scope
through]{.underline}** the mission in Afghanistan as well as a
**[counterterrorist operation]{.underline}** in the Mediterranean and
counterpiracy efforts in the Gulf of Aden and off the Horn of Africa (in
addition to continuing the enlargement process). But as NATO has
broadened its scope, some members have grown concerned that the alliance
is shifting its attention away from Europe. These members seek to return
NATO to a more traditional understanding of its role defending against
threats on the continent, particularly as an increasingly authoritarian
and assertive Russian government has sought to reclaim a sphere of
influence lost in the Soviet collapse. In November 2010, NATO will
release a new "strategic concept" to guide the alliance going forward.
That document must state clearly that providing for collective defense
in the twenty-first century goes well beyond defending against the
"armed attack" of Article V. To remain relevant, **[NATO]{.underline}**
must expand its traditional understanding of collective defense to
**[confront the twenty-first-century threats of terrorism, proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) to both states and nonstate actors,
and cyberwarfare.]{.underline}** By necessity, the United States has
turned its attention away from Europe in order to **[counter these
modern threats]{.underline}**, which largely emanate from Africa, the
broader Middle East, and Asia. **[If NATO fails]{.underline}** to accept
a growing global role, **[then the United States will lose interest in
investing]{.underline}** in the alliance's future. But Europe faces
these threats too and must recognize that a more **[robust NATO
offers]{.underline}** it **[the chance to counter them.]{.underline}**
Given the varied nature and source of threats today, NATO can be
successful only if the Europeans agree to stronger NATO-European Union
(EU) cooperation and to closer ties with major non-European democracies,
particularly those in the AsiaPacific region.

## Impacts \-\-- Emerging Tech/Turns & Solves

### Impacts \-\-- DIANA Solves Case

#### DIANA increases innovation now

for the North Atlantic (DIANA)," *European Army Interoperability

When the Covid-19 crisis led to a lockdown of all activities, the lack
of digital literacy from governmental bodies and defence personal
exposed both a new threat and an opportunity. Bearing this situation in
mind, **[[NATO members]{.mark} (NM) have [agreed]{.mark} at the 31st
annual summit, held in June 2020 in Brussels, [to initiate]{.mark} the
Defence Innovation Accelerator of the North Atlantic
([DIANA]{.mark})]{.underline}** that aims to reach full operability
capacities by 2023. DIANA is NATO's version of the U.S Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA). It will reinforce transatlantic
cooperation regarding critical technologies to assure the security and
defence digital literacy of NM.

**[This initiative is a [joint effort between private-sector
entities]{.mark}, non-governmental entities, and academia. NATO's
Assistant Secretary-General David van Weel explains that although
[financial support from companies]{.mark} and start-ups [are crucial for
funding]{.mark} the research projects, intellectual property will not be
requested]{.underline}** (Vivienne Machi, 2021). This is where academia
joins the operation, providing the necessary technical knowledge for the
development and creation of technologies to improve Emerging and
Disruptive Technologies (EDTs): **[Artificial intelligence
([AI]{.mark}), [quantum]{.mark}-enable technologies, and
big-[data]{.mark} processing. This takes place on top of supporting the
remaining EDTs: Data and Computing, Autonomy, Biotechnology and Human
enhancements, Hypersonic technologies, and Space]{.underline}** (Tania
Latici, 2021).

**[Assistant Secretary-General van Weel also pointed out that the
defence community has a wide range of technological needs that go way
beyond the expected ones. Interested start-ups and Small to Medium-sized
Enterprises (SME's) are welcome to get to know the
project.]{.underline}** Thus, they can enter a trusted capital
marketplace that connects qualified investors pre-selected NATO with
start-ups, generating a strong network crucial for the development of
DIANA. Assistant Secretary-General van Weel further explained that SME's
and start-ups would not solely provide funds, as NM have exceptionally
agreed on building a venture capital fund for providing economic support
to companies that develop dual-use and key technologies that could be of
use for NATO. The NATO Innovation Fund is a bold optional investment on
a 15-year time plan with an expected budget of €70 million annually
(Vivienne Machi, 2021). Nonetheless, as van Weel stated, "I read
somewhere that NATO is not a bank --- we are not, but it will be a
country that will fund and give a general direction." **[This fund was
inspired by the US Department of Defense project "Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA)" established in 2019 that has proven to be an
efficient financial mechanism (Fuentitech, 2021) and aims to provide
extra financial aid to DIANA.]{.underline}**

**[[By investing in disruptive technologies, NATO expects to be ready
for the emerging security challenges]{.mark} facing the NM in this new
era of warfare.]{.underline}** **[By joining forces, efforts, and funds
with SME's, investors, and start-ups, NATO focuses on enhancing
technological and digital defence mechanisms.]{.underline}** These can
create more independence and self-sufficiency, allowing NM to achieve
the competitive military technological level of the United States and
China. The Assistant Secretary-General argued that defence innovation
has come a long way since the 1970s. The lack of proper investment in
the field has put NM in a dependent relationship with the current world
leaders in the area, namely the United States and China. **[In this
sense, the [DIANA initiative is presented as an alternative]{.mark}
solution [that will boost economic]{.mark}, military, [and]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nological [development]{.mark} for NM]{.underline}** (Maija
Palmer, 2021).

**[[DIANA]{.mark} also aims to [decrease]{.mark} the [gap]{.mark}
between SME's [and investors, positively affecting an economic
exchange]{.mark} that will impact future disruptive technologies
investment as a whole, benefiting all seven
areas: ]{.underline}**artificial intelligence; quantum-enabled
technologies; big data processing; hypersonics; biotechnology; space and
autonomy not only the military and defence inclined ones (Jane Edwards,
2021). **[[DIANA combines a multitude of strategic needs]{.mark}: the
start-up function for trustworthy stakeholders while developing new
technologies, the academic content producing function that provides the
intellectual and technical support]{.underline}** to the creation and
analysis of imminent technologies, and the funding function from
government and stakeholders that hold the capital power but lack the
creational capabilities.

**[After reaching its full capacities, [DIANA]{.mark} is scheduled [to
become the focal point for NM to cooperate and coordinate the
development of new military technologies]{.mark} through the offices and
tests centres that will be placed in the Alliance
countries]{.underline}** (Antonela Ionita, 2021). DIANA will have two
headquarters, in North America and Europe, that will work closely
together with their subordinated centres. **[Alongside this, the
maintenance of the network line that will connect start-ups, academia,
and stakeholders will be thoroughly coordinated by DIANA]{.underline}**.
Contrary to some doubts raised, DIANA does not present a threat to the
NATO Industry Forum (NIF), but is instead a completely different
community aiming to adapt NM's military strategies to the challenges
imposed by the new era of warfare (Fuentitech, 2021). 

**[NIF and DIANA will operate independently and will both abide by the
Secretary-General]{.underline}** (SACEUR), Supreme Allied Commander
Transformation (SACT), **[and NATO. It is key to allow both projects the
freedom to create and innovate that comes with the risks of not always
achieving a successful outcome.]{.underline}** The world's most
impactful defence organisations and leading start-ups have embedded
risk-taking in their culture, as it is the only way to assure
innovation, even if it is not necessarily the safest. **[This is why the
[funding for this project is a collaboration between government and
non-government actors, to allow the enhancement of military
tech]{.mark}nology and disruptive technological advances of NATO
Allies]{.underline}** (Nicholas Nelson, 2021).

#### NATO is already involved in setting Allied targets for emerging technology and building industry partnerships -- solves the aff better while avoiding direct engagement.

defence,\" NATO Review,

In a globalised but also more confrontational and complex world,
resilience will remain an ongoing concern for Allies, requiring constant
adaptation as new vulnerabilities and threats emerge. Virtual
vulnerabilities Cyber space is perhaps the most extreme form of this
vulnerability as it interconnects the entire planet in real time, making
it possible for anybody to attack any electronically operated target
from anywhere at any moment. This vastly complicates the task of
defenders, who can rarely know in advance that an attack is being
launched, where it will strike or where it will originate. So the
defender has to try to protect every important part of the national
economic or military infrastructure all the time, while the attacker can
choose the individual segment or vulnerable fault line that he wishes to
disrupt. SCADAs -- or automated control systems for electrical grids or
energy pipelines -- are just one example of how infrastructure that we
depend on for the normal functioning of our lives is increasingly
automated, remotely controlled or integrated into ever more complex
networks, which are vulnerable to attack. SCADAs -- or automated control
systems for electrical grids or energy pipelines -- are just one example
of how infrastructure that we depend on for the normal functioning of
our lives is increasingly automated, remotely controlled or integrated
into ever more complex networks, which are vulnerable to attack. As we
move from the internet of things to the internet of everything, more and
more of the infrastructure that we depend on for the normal functioning
of our lives is being automated or controlled from remoter distances or
integrated into ever more complex networks. The SCADAs -- or automated
control systems for electrical grids or energy pipelines -- are but one
example. So are cross-border grids which means an energy blackout in
Italy can immediately turn off the power in parts of Switzerland, or an
overload at one transmission plant in India can plunge 400 million
people into temporary darkness, to cite just two recent examples. The
globalisation of networks and the increasing integration of physical
infrastructure into the virtual world, for instance the storage of data
not in machines but in 'clouds', has certainly brought about
efficiencies and savings. But it has also greatly magnified the
consequences of a disruption and the number of key nodal points and
attack surfaces that malevolent actors can exploit. Civil preparedness A
second tendency increasing the sense of societal vulnerability is the
state of civil preparedness within the Alliance. The delivery of forces
and military capabilities that NATO needs to uphold collective defence
or to project forces beyond its territory relies on civilian resources.
During the Cold War, many of these, such as railways, ports, airfields,
grids or airspace were in state hands and easily transferred to NATO
control in a crisis or wartime situation. Today, by contrast, 90 per
cent of NATO's supplies and logistics are moved by private companies and
75 per cent of the host nation support for NATO forces forward deployed
on the territory of the eastern Allies comes from private sector
contracts. Similarly, when facing distributed denial of service
cyber-attacks against its outward-facing networks, NATO has relied on
cooperation from the telecoms sector and the internet security companies
to filter and capture data, identify malware and provide extra
bandwidth. Without doubt the transfer of ownership and responsibility to
the private sector has brought cost-efficiencies; but the quest to
reduce costs and overheads to increase profitability has also led to
less redundancy and less resilience. In addition, as hybrid threats
below the threshold of NATO's collective defence clause (Article 5 of
its founding treaty) blur the traditional distinction between peace and
war, government special powers based on wartime emergency legislation
have become less practical to implement or even obsolete. Whether it be
for mobilizing troops for collective defence or to strengthen the
ability to defend against -- or recover from -- hybrid attack, NATO is
increasingly dependent on infrastructure and assets in the private
sector. Whether it be for mobilizing troops for collective defence or to
strengthen the ability to defend against -- or recover from -- hybrid
attack, NATO is increasingly dependent on infrastructure and assets in
the private sector. As a result, NATO faces two distinct but
inter-related resilience challenges: first, to ensure that it can
speedily move all the forces and equipment required to any part of the
Alliance facing an imminent threat or attack, ensuring full and
unimpeded access to all the infrastructure it needs for this purpose;
and second, to be able to anticipate, identify, mitigate and recover
from hybrid attacks with minimum disruptive impact on the Alliance's
social, political and military cohesion. Civil preparedness is, above
all, a national responsibility, in the same way that Allies must ensure
adequate cyber defence for their critical information technology
networks, especially the ones that NATO depends on for its own
operations. This said, Allies' security relies on individual nations
upholding this commitment; and NATO has an interest in obtaining as much
transparency as possible, so that it can assess potential
vulnerabilities or gaps and accurately measure progress. Avoiding
unpleasant surprises in crisis situations when the Alliance needs swift
and reliable information and the capacity to analyse, decide and respond
swiftly has to be the goal. Consequently, the theme of 'resilience' --
how to define it, assess it and enhance it across the Alliance -- has
become a leading topic for the NATO Summit in Warsaw, in July.
Resilience is increasingly seen as the corollary of deterrence and
reassurance measures in the classical military sphere as part of a
comprehensive security strategy for the Alliance. The seven baseline
requirements to be assessed are: 1) assured continuity of government and
critical government services; 2) resilient energy supplies; 3) ability
to deal effectively with the uncontrolled movement of people; 4)
resilient food and water resources; 5) ability to deal with mass
casualties; 6) resilient communications systems; and finally 7)
resilient transportation systems. These seven areas apply to the entire
crisis spectrum, from an evolving hybrid threat all the way up to the
most demanding scenarios envisaged by Alliance planners. So how can NATO
make its contribution to improving resilience within its 28 Allied
nations? Five specific areas come to mind: Cyber defence The first is
cyber defence. NATO experiences 200 million incidents on its networks
every day and around 200 more serious intrusion attempts every month.
This level of hostile activity is also what Allies are experiencing as
the 'new normal' in the cyber domain. NATO's first task has been to
upgrade the protection of its own networks by giving the NATO Cyber
Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) additional capabilities for earlier
detection and more rapid response to cyberattacks. Two Rapid Response
teams have also been created to assist Allies, as well as to manage
incidents affecting NATO itself. **[NATO has now moved on to help Allies
improve their cyber resilience by introducing capability targets into
the NATO defence planning process and devising a new memorandum of
understanding between NATO and individual Allies to establish secure
connectivity and arrangements for information-sharing and crisis
management.]{.underline}** A number of [**Allies have come together to
develop specific capabilities in fields such as a malware
information-sharing platform, training and education, and systems
configuration for effective decision-making.**]{.underline} The NATO
Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Estonia has helped
NATO to organize state-of-the art annual exercises to improve the skills
of cyber operators using a cyber range that Estonia has transferred to
NATO. Finally, and given the importance of industry that owns 90 per
cent of the networks NATO and the Allies depend on, **[the Alliance is
developing a NATO-industry cyber partnership to encourage
information-sharing and best practices. This will give NATO a better
grasp of the rapid pace of innovation in the sphere of information
technology and how it can better integrate emerging technologies and new
concepts into its cyber defence.]{.underline}** The proposal to create
**[an 'innovation hub' at the NATO Communications and Information Agency
should facilitate this dialogue and mutual understanding between NATO
and the small-and-medium-size technology providers that are often the
most innovative in this area.]{.underline}** As the Alliance looks
towards the Warsaw Summit, some further measures are on the table. One
is a 'cyber defence pledge' or commitment to speed up national
implementation of the NATO capability targets, which requires sustained
national focus and adequate resources. A second idea is to look into the
political, legal and operational consequences of declaring cyber as a
domain, as many Allies have done already in terms of their national
cyber strategies. This reflects the increasing awareness that most
conflicts and crises these days have a cyber dimension and that -- as
NATO increases the momentum of its military activities for collective
defence -- NATO commanders need the requisite tools and authorities to
defend against advanced cyberattacks and to operate across the cyber
spectrum. Hybrid threats A second area of resilience is a strategy to
respond to hybrid warfare which NATO foreign ministers approved last
December. **[NATO is improving its intelligence-sharing and early
warning processes in order to better anticipate and map hybrid warfare
activities]{.underline}**. It is developing in this respect a set of
early warning indicators that can trigger a number of crisis-response
options. This is because rapid identification of a hybrid attack (as
opposed to an isolated or random incident) and speedy decision-making
are essential to nip these attacks in the bud and block escalation. NATO
ambassadors and defence ministers have held simulation and
scenario-based exercises to fine-tune their situational awareness and
responsiveness vis-à-vis threats, which are specifically designed to be
ambiguous and difficult to attribute. Effective strategic communications
to dispel false information, propaganda, lies and myths is also an
essential part of coping with hybrid attacks that seek to confuse public
opinion, aggravate social tensions and undermine trust in governments.
All this does not mean that Allies are as vulnerable to a hybrid attack
as Ukraine proved to be during Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea.
However, **[Allies are now encouraged to map potential vulnerabilities
that can arise from Russia's involvement in business, financial, media
or energy concerns, for example, and to share the lessons learned from
resilience stress testing more broadly within NATO.]{.underline}**
Civil-military readiness A third area under discussion concerns NATO's
ability to fully implement its Readiness Action Plan for the
reinforcement and defence of Allies, whether to the east or to the
south. NATO members have to adjust their territorial defence mechanisms
and infrastructure to the new security environment and revive the
planning fora that existed during the Cold War. In particular, NATO
planners require cross-border transit arrangements for the rapid
deployment of the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force and NATO Response
Force. As new Graduated Response Plans for detailed collective defence
arrangements are adopted, the Allies must ensure that elements such as
transport, flight corridors, civil-military airspace coordination, fuel
stocks, pre-positioned equipment, port access and legal agreements are
fully integrated into military planning. Crisis-response measures to
activate civil emergency measures will need to be updated and civil
defence requirements will need to be given more attention, based on the
military requirements for the Readiness Action Plan and associated
capability packages for its deployment. A more sustained dialogue
between military commanders and national civil emergency authorities is
now being established. Stepping up cooperation with the EU A fourth area
is the relationship between NATO and the European Union (EU). The two
organisations occupy different parts of the resilience spectrum but
there is also considerable overlap in the middle. A joined-up approach
based on a shared situational awareness and coordination of responses is
key to a successful response. Currently NATO is talking with the EU on
enhanced cooperation in four areas: civil-military planning; cyber
defence; information-sharing; and analysis and coordinated strategic
communication to spot disinformation and communicate a credible
narrative. One early deliverable is a technical arrangement between the
NATO NCIRC and the EU Computer Emergency Response Team (EU CERT) for the
exchange of information, which was concluded in early February. Up to
the Warsaw Summit, NATO and the EU are continuing their discussions at
the staff level, as the EU finalises its own strategy to respond to
hybrid threats. The aim is to harmonise procedures and to support each
other's efforts in responding comprehensively. The ambition is to
identify pragmatic, flexible approaches which could be reflected in a
joint declaration by NATO and the EU at the Warsaw Summit. NATO and the
EU are also developing compatible 'playbooks' to ensure more
participation in each other's activities, such as exercises and
training. It is also important that NATO and the EU work together to
tackle other resilience challenges that do not result from deliberate
attacks. The most urgent of these is the migration crisis. NATO has
recently deployed a maritime task force in the Aegean to work with
Greece and Turkey and the EU border agency, Frontex, to monitor the flow
of refugees and migrants and in this way help to curb the illegal
activities of smugglers and traffickers. Working with partner countries
Finally, NATO's partners can also help to improve the Alliance's overall
resilience. Not only Ukraine but many other partners have been the
victim of hybrid operations. Their experiences and lessons learned can
help NATO to better understand the type and impact of hybrid tactics.
More information-sharing and early warning can help NATO decision-makers
to identify incipient attacks that could start in a partner country but
rapidly spread to NATO territory. Conversely, NATO's experience and
expertise can help partners improve their own capacity for resilience.
Unsurprisingly resilience areas like cyber defence and civil emergency
planning are increasingly featuring in defence capacity building
packages for partners such as Georgia, Moldova, Jordan and Iraq. In the
Baltic region, Sweden and Finland -- two of NATO's most active partners,
which have enhanced opportunities for dialogue and cooperation -- have
also faced hybrid pressures from Russia. These Nordic partners have
drawn closer to NATO through consultations, training and exercises,
including the conclusion of host nation support arrangements for crisis
assistance. In conclusion, Allies need to adapt constantly as new
vulnerabilities and threats emerge from non-state actors such as
so-called Islamic State, as much as from state actors like Russia.
Resilience is here to stay as a core element of collective defence. That
is why NATO will stay focused on reducing its exposure to threats to its
cohesion, independence and security.2

STUTTGART, Germany --- **[In less than two years, NATO hopes to have its
own]{.underline}**, modified version of the U.S. Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (**[DARPA) up and running. Alliance members
agreed]{.underline}** at the 31st annual summit, held June 14 in
Brussels, **[to launch a new initiative dubbed]{.underline}** the
Defence Innovation Accelerator of the North Atlantic, or **[DIANA, meant
to speed up trans-Atlantic cooperation on critical
technologies]{.underline}**, **[and help NATO work more closely with
private-sector entities, academia and other non-governmental entities.
The goal is to have DIANA reach initial operating capability (IOC) by
2023]{.underline}**, David van Weel, assistant secretary-general for
emerging security challenges, said at a Tuesday virtual roundtable with
reporters. By next year, the hope is to have "the initial parts ...
starting to come up into fruition," he added. In the long term, DIANA
will have headquarters both in North America and in Europe, and link to
existing test centers throughout NATO member countries that **[will be
used for "validating, testing, and co-designing applications in the
field of emerging and disruptive technologies]{.underline}**," van Weel
said. **[DIANA will also be responsible for building and managing a
network meant to help relevant startups grow and support NATO's
technology needs via grant programs]{.underline}**. **[The focus will be
on national security and defense purposes]{.underline}**, and DIANA will
not ask for or solicit companies' intellectual property, van Weel noted.
**[While he singled out artificial intelligence, big-data processing,
and quantum-enabled technologies, DIANA is meant to
support]{.underline}** all seven of the key emerging and disruptive
technologies --- or EDTs --- that NATO has identified as critical for
the future. The other four include: **[autonomy, biotechnology,
hypersonics and space]{.underline}**. Sometimes a technology company may
not realize that their product could be viable for the defense
community, he added. **[One key component of DIANA will be a trusted
capital marketplace, where smaller companies can connect with
pre-qualified investors who are interested in supporting NATO's
technology efforts]{.underline}**. Ensuring that investors are vetted
ahead of time will allow NATO to ensure "that the technology will be
protected from illicit transfers," van Weel said. **[The fund is modeled
after a The U.S. Defense Department]{.underline}** set up its own
trusted capital marketplace in 2019 as a tool that then-DoD acquisition
czar Ellen Lord said could help encourage domestically based venture
capitalists to fund national security and defense projects. That
marketplace served as inspiration for the announced NATO trusted capital
marketplace, per the alliance. **[Members also agreed for the first time
to build up a venture capital fund to support companies developing
dual-use and key technologies that could be useful to
NATO,]{.underline}** and which will be optional for member-nations to
participate in. The NATO Innovation Fund, as it's called, would have a
running time of about 15 years to start, and would be underwritten by
about 70 million euro (about \$83 million) per year, per van Weel.
**[The goal is not for NATO headquarters or for its member-nations to
run the innovation fund]{.underline}**, he noted. "**[The actual running
of a venture capital fund, we believe, should be done by companies that
have a broad range of experience in the field]{.underline}**." He cited
the U.S.-based capital venture firm In-Q-Tel as an example of the type
of partner NATO would seek to run the "day-to-day" business of the fund.
"I read somewhere that NATO is not a bank---we're not," van Weel said.
"But it will be the nations providing the funds, and giving the general
direction." **[These two initiatives of a technology accelerator and
innovation fund are "hopefully going to ... bring the alliance forward
into the 21st century]{.underline}**," van Weel said. NATO has
previously invested in information technology (IT) and software through
the NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA), but the
difference with the innovation fund, and DIANA, is that the alliance
wants to better connect with early-stage startups, rather than larger
software companies or traditional defense firms, van Weel said.
"**[DIANA is not about taking over innovation for the NATO
enterprise]{.underline}**," he said. "**[It's a different
community]{.underline}**, **[and requires different funding mechanisms
and different types of engagement."]{.underline}** These two initiatives
have been long awaited and demanded by NATO observers, and versions of
both a "DARPA-like" technology accelerator and an alliance-wide
investment bank were included in a 2020 list of recommendations by
NATO's advisory group on emerging and disruptive technologies. But it is
still early days. While the IOC goal is 2023, "step one is we want to
know from allies what they want to offer to DIANA," van Weel said. Once
the NATO Innovation Fund has its participating members, for example, a
charter will be set up that will lay out the funding models, rapid
contracting processes, and leadership guidelines. "**[We are trying to
do this as fast as we can,"]{.underline}** van Weel assured, but then
noted, "we do want to get it right, because ... with the startup
community, you only get one chance."

**[[NATO]{.mark} has [launched]{.mark} a new research programme called
[DIANA]{.mark} [to bring industry, start-up companies]{.mark} [and
academia together to research new dual-use tech]{.mark}nologies [that
address]{.mark} both societal problems and national [security

**[The Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic
([DIANA]{.mark}) is [focus]{.mark}ing [on]{.mark} technologies such as
[a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence, [big data]{.mark} processing,
[quantum]{.mark}-enabled [tech]{.mark}nologies, autonomy,
[biotech]{.mark}nology, novel materials and space.]{.underline}**

In its initial stage, DIANA will run a network of more than 10
accelerator sites and over 50 test centres in innovation hubs across
NATO alliance countries. The aim is to give innovators the means to
bring dual use technologies closer to the market. No budget for the
network has been announced yet, but pilot activities will start as early
as summer 2023, with the aim of being fully up and running in 2025.

**[[There is also a complementary €1 billion venture capital fund for
early stage start-ups.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Tomas Jermalavičius, head of studies at the Estonia-based think tank
International Centre for Defence and Security (ICDS), says this marks a
notable shift in the alliance's stance on innovation.

"It's almost a revolutionary step. Creating this NATO structure shows
flexibility and ability to take advantage of all the capacities that
exist in the private sector, where innovations are born," he said.

Until this point, the alliance has only supported applied research
through the Collaboration Support Office in Paris, leaving a gap in
support for translating technologies to the market.

**[The [bid to spruce up its innovation]{.mark} capabilities [predates
the Russian invasion]{.mark} and was agreed on at the 2021 NATO Summit
in Brussels]{.underline}**. The fleshed out plans for DIANA were
published last week, following a meeting of NATO defence ministers. This
is not the only military research announcement to [pop
up](https://sciencebusiness.net/news/science-goes-war-western-allies-step-collaboration-military-research) in
the past weeks, with the US, Australia and UK setting out the AUKUS
Quantum arrangement which eyes expanded quantum, hypersonic and other
joint weapons research.

Technology dominance

**[[The nine techn]{.mark}ologies [NATO wants to advance]{.mark} are AI;
data and computing; autonomy; quantum-enabled technologies;
biotechnology and human enhancements; hypersonic technologies; space;
novel materials and manufacturing; and energy and
propulsion.]{.underline}**

**[These [are all strategic for NATO if it is to maintain
tech]{.mark}nological [dominance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Losing grip was
one of the drivers for DIANA, Jermalavičius says.

The bid for technology dominance over countries like China and Russia is
also a driver for DIANA's goal of shortening the technology development
cycle, especially when it comes to software, AI and quantum. "It's a
long horizon, but capabilities do not appear overnight," said
Jermalavičius.

The plan is for DIANA to launch challenge calls for non-dilutive
financing that does not require start-ups to give up equity or ownership
in their company. Mentoring, technology testing and potential contract
opportunities will be available to go hand in hand with the financing.

This will be delivered through network of innovation hubs across the
alliance. One such site is the Big Data for Smart Society Institute
(GATE) based in Bulgaria. An official at GATE said that the institute's
work in DIANA will focus on digital health, intra governmental
communications and using data in industry and city infrastructure. One
focus will be on disinformation research.

**[[However the official noted DIANA is still in its early
stages]{.mark}. [Talks are ongoing with NATO to flesh ou]{.mark}t
exactly [how cooperation will work]{.mark} between research
centres]{.underline}**, the national government, and the NATO
secretariat.

The approved charter stipulates some details, though others are still to
be discussed, for example the affiliated centres of the network and the
points of contact between them. **[The official said that many of [these
are likely to be finalised]{.mark} at a meeting [at the end of

Euractiv,
https://www.euractiv.com/section/defence-and-security/opinion/emerging-technology-the-geo-economic-achilles-heel-nato-needs-to-address/

To ensure NATO's relevance and to keep "our people safe", the Alliance
"must continue to strengthen and modernize our deterrence and defence,"
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said at the Riga Summit on 30
November 2021. Innovation plays a critical role in modernizing armed
forces amid a complex strategic environment.

To this purpose, **[Stoltenberg unveiled the Defence Innovation
Accelerator for the North Atlantic ([DIANA]{.mark}) on 22 October 2021.
DIANA shall [bring defence and commercial companies together]{.mark}
with military users to develop novel solutions that meet the needs of
the future battlefield.]{.underline}** He also launched the NATO
Innovation Fund to invest up to €1bn to support innovators developing
emerging technologies.

**[The announcement comes at a time when the [Alliance]{.mark} is
[working on a new Strategic Concept.]{.mark} Innovation will be key to
preserving NATO's edge]{.underline}**, as the Secretary-General pointed
out in his 2030 food for thought paper. Although NATO is a potent
defence organization, emphasis on emerging technologies reveals its
Achilles' heel.

**[[A]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence, autonomy,
[biotech]{.mark}nology, [quantum]{.mark} technology, [and other
tech]{.mark}nologies are at the heart of geoeconomic
competition]{.underline}**. Geoeconomic competition unfolds around the
projection of economic power within and across the domains of land, air,
sea, space, and cyberspace to achieve political goals.

Today's geoeconomic dynamic defines winning business models amid a
growing dichotomy between market-driven and state-driven nations. It
aims to set the rules, principles, and standards that guide economic
activities and access to and ownership of emerging technologies.

NATO's current emphasis on emerging technologies with defence and
commercial applications risks making the Alliance subject to this new
geoeconomic dynamic. **[This [dynamic]{.mark} can [undermine NATO's
innovation agenda]{.mark} and endanger its strategic edge. Therefore,
NATO needs to respond.]{.underline}**

**[First, [NATO will embrace the]{.mark} realities of [economic
security]{.mark} seriously. This call flows logically from Article 2 of
the North Atlantic Treaty, [encouraging allies' economic
collaborations.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[In our view, economic security combines national security and
economic policy with technology and innovation policy to identify
economic disruptions. It also prevents these disruptions from arising
and strengthens a coping capacity to deal with economic
emergencies.]{.underline}**

**[[Economic security requires allies]{.mark}, for example, [to
engage]{.mark} on defence-critical [standards]{.mark}, advancing
transparency for defence supply chains, and considering the interplay
between technology development, foreign direct investment, and export
control. Therefore, the new Strategic Concept should incorporate
economic security as an essential element.]{.underline}**

Second, economic security requires NATO to shape mindsets about defence
investments and sustainability. Already today, defence companies face
financial challenges as banks cancel bank accounts or refrain from
covering export risks.

The emphasis on environmental, social, and governance criteria (ESG)
that increasingly shapes and determines financial investments will
reinforce these problems as defence is considered toxic. But a narrow
interpretation of ESG that considers defence incompatible with the world
view underpinning ESG is detrimental to NATO's ambition to invest in
companies. It also means other investors will likely shy away from
investing in the same companies.

Therefore, the Alliance needs to step up activities with the European
Commission, which works on a classification system to identify
ESG-compliant activities, to make defence investments compatible.

**[Third, [business]{.mark} [is the first line of defence in a
geoeconomic world, and NATO needs a platform to discuss geoeconomics
with business.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Today, the NATO Industry Forum is the leading gathering to address
defence industrial matters with defence companies. However, the emphasis
on emerging technologies underlines the importance of non-defence
companies.

**[Therefore, [NATO should]{.mark} envisage a new special format of the
North Atlantic Council to [meet with the NATO Industry Forum
members]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- and possibly also the European
Commission **[-- to allow state and corporate leaders to jointly engage
on the proposed economic security agenda.]{.underline}**

Fourth, strategic-level public-private dialogue also breathes new life
into deepening cooperation with the private sector. NATO should become
an early adopter of the solutions developed with allied money.

**[Making NATO the launch customer sends important market signals and
provides companies with an initial track record confirming the relevance
of their solutions]{.underline}**. In addition, the Alliance should step
up efforts to incorporate business into military operations. Logistics
companies already play a crucial role, and traditional defence
businesses provide frontline support.

The next stage comes with closely integrating digital companies to
leverage their contribution. But for non-defence companies to provide
frontline support, NATO not only needs the right mindset, but the
Alliance also needs to think about incentives such as covering personnel
risks on overseas deployments.

**[Finally, [NATO's ability to stimulate innovation and ensure economic
security]{.mark} also [depends on]{.mark} how it does
[business]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Critically, NATO needs to strive for a mission and capabilities-based
innovation portfolio that maximises the value of allied money. NATO may
take a page from the financial services industry and use a real options
approach to manage technological risk and drive technology development.
This approach prices technology building blocks like financial options,
advances risk mitigation, speeds up technology adoption and gives force
planners and developers more leeway to maximise input and output.

In addition, NATO should offer strategic hedging solutions for defence
critical raw materials by combining corporate demand estimates with
AI-based insights on financial and raw material markets. This will
facilitate optimal, company-tailored hedging strategies to mitigate the
corporate security of supply and price risks.

Overall, NATO's relevance in the 21st century remains tackling defence
challenges in a new strategic environment, increasingly defined by

### Impacts \-\-- DIANA Now Solves

#### DIANA now solves AI breakthroughs 

**Christie '22**

(E. H. Christie, Finnish Institute of International Affairs, "Defence
cooperation in artificial intelligence: Bridging the transatlantic gap
for a stronger Europe," European View 2022, Vol. 21(1) 13 --2 //um-ef)

Investment challenges go beyond issues of scale. The US also has greater
experience in the setting up and operation of structures to promote both
military and dual-use innovation. While the best-known institution is
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, other US government
structures are also relevant in discussions on fostering innovation in
AI for military applications. A much-discussed example is In-Q-Tel,
which was originally set up as the state venture-capital arm of the
Central Intelligence Agency. To illustrate the influence of the In-Q-Tel
example, one may note that both its current Chief Executive Officer,
Chris Darby, and one of its former Chief Executive Officers, Gilman
Louie, served among the 15 commissioners of the National Security
Commission on Artificial Intelligence.4 This was a temporarily created
expert commission mandated 18 European View 21(1) by the US Congress to
provide policy recommendations for a whole-of-government and
whole-of-society approach for US AI policy.5 With In-Q-Tel, the idea is
to learn from private-sector practices in the area of venturecapital
investment and repurpose them for state needs and more patient time
horizons. A supported company should pursue product development
strategies aimed at serving both civilian markets and government needs.
In this way, rather than effectively taking over a commercial company
and limiting its growth potential to future government contracts alone,
the government body encourages an intermediate trajectory made up of
mixed revenue streams, in the hope that this will generate greater
returns to scale and higher efficiency thanks to the disciplining effect
of private-sector competition. Conversely, the advantage of this
approach as compared to not intervening at all is that the commercial
company will integrate current and likely future government needs into
its product and business-development strategy, rather than ignoring them
and finding itself, at a later date, unable to supply the government
sector according to the latter's requirements. A **[related issue which
falls between what can be achieved with new investment instruments and
new protections that can be assured through the screening of foreign
direct investment is the provision of investment from trusted private
investors to the technology sector]{.underline}**. Certain technology
companies that are not part of the traditional defence industry may be
developing dual-use products that are of potential interest to the
defence sector while having limited awareness of national security
concerns. This may make them vulnerable targets for both licit and
illicit attempts to acquire their technologies on the part of foreign
state actors. At the same time, their business development needs may
lead them to seek investment from any potential source, thus exposing
them to potential risks. To respond to this challenge, the US Department
of Defense has launched a scheme called the Trusted Capital Marketplace
(US Department of Defense 2021a). Building on these considerations,
**[the NATO Innovation Unit has developed two new instruments for Allied
use]{.underline}** which were announced to the public in October 2021
(NATO 2021a; 2021b). **[Both instruments aim to foster technological
innovation with a deliberate focus on dual-use
applications]{.underline}** and on enterprises with mixed (potential)
revenue streams. **[The first]{.underline}** instrument is the Defence
Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (**[DIANA), which is a
NATO instrument]{.underline}**, that is, it **[involves the
participation of all 30 NATO Allies. The second]{.underline}**
instrument is the **[NATO Innovation Fund]{.underline}**, **[which in
NATO terminology is a 'multinational' instrument, namely one that Allies
freely opt into]{.underline}**. **[DIANA will aim to accelerate the
adoption of dual-use technological solutions through several
interlocking components]{.underline}**.6 First, **[it will develop a
network of national organisations, in particular test centres and
innovation accelerators]{.underline}**. Second, it will **[competitively
select private-sector innovators and allow them to use national
organisations in the network to interface with military end users and

envisaged that **[DIANA will provide mentorship and education services

Fund]{.underline}** as of the date of its announcement in October 2021.
**[The participating Allies will inject up to €1 billion into Allied

aims to attract additional private investments due to the de-risking
effect, both financial and technological, thanks to state co-funding and
diligence and screening efforts]{.underline}**. **[The funds are
intended to be used for long-term support of 'deep tech' innovative
companies]{.underline}**, that is, for advanced research into AI,
quantum and related technologies that may have both military and
civilian applications. Due diligence and security screening practices
will aim to ensure that both private investors and fund recipients are
trusted entities.

<https://cepa.org/getting-nato-innovation-right/> //um-ef)

The **[[Defense Innovation Accelerator]{.underline}]{.mark}** and NATO
Innovation Fund announced at the NATO Summit are welcome developments,
but they require new authorities and differentiated talent. Swift
technological change has meant governments and the military created new
organizations and approaches to innovation and rapid acquisition.
Unfortunately, many do not have the necessary authority, budget, or
workforce to succeed, meaning that meaningful change and impact have
been sacrificed for theater. For the newly announced Defense Innovation
Accelerator North Atlantic (**[[DIANA)]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- with
planned locations in Toronto and Cambridge, UK -- and the NATO
Innovation Fund (NIF) to succeed, they **[[must address authority and
budget concerns, and then bring in the right personnel to lead and staff
them]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Authorities There are three key authorities
that NATO must get right for DIANA and NIF: **[[reporting lines,
patience]{.underline}]{.mark}** (or willingness to accept failure),
**[[and decision making]{.underline}]{.mark}**. First, **[[DIANA and NIF
should operate independently]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[with a direct
line into the most senior decision-makers]{.underline}]{.mark}** (the
Secretary General, SACEUR, Supreme Allied Commander Transformation ---
SACT, etc). Second, **[[they need to be allowed to
fail]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The most impactful defense organizations
(and indeed commercial organizations, particularly in the startup world)
normalize taking big bets, with the knowledge that many will likely
fail, and even the ones that succeed may take years to realize their
full impact. Third and finally, **[[these new NATO bodies need to invest
in or provide support to initiatives and startups without requiring
external permission or consensus]{.underline}]{.mark}**. At the same
time, they also need a clear transition partner for promising
capabilities to be handed off to (e.g. DARPA transitioning tech to the
U.S. Department of Defense), which can move from development to
deployment. **[[This will enable the Alliance to more readily identify,
develop, and deploy emerging and disruptive
technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Similar efforts including the U.S.
Department of Defense's DARPA and Defense Innovation Unit, CIA's
In-Q-Tel, and USAF's Strategic Capabilities Office, are effective
because they exist outside of traditional bureaucracies, leverage
non-traditional talent strategies, and have consistent budgets. Budget
Allocating funding seems obvious, but too often limited forethought is
given to this issue. To ensure success, organizational funding must be
significant, multi-year, and consistent or include inbuilt annual
growth. A number of high-potential initiatives have either been
announced with no dedicated funding or have had sizable funding gaps in
subsequent years damaging their brand and relationships with defense
companies and startups alike. The NIF in particular will likely rely on
the willingness of Alliance members to make contributions beyond other
NATO obligations. If so, multi-year commitments are crucial, as are
success metrics, such as return on investment, which are rarely used
within NATO or national government departments. Talent Finally, and most
overlooked, is getting talent right. External talent is crucial. It is
not enough to simply construct new organizations staffed in the
traditional manner. To realize their full potential, NATO must attract
talent with startup and/or venture capital (VC) experience, and pair
them with top subject-matter experts from R&D communities, both
government, and commercial. This cannot be done with NATO's current
Byzantine, long, drawn-out hiring process, which can last six months or
even longer, and advantage insiders versus external candidates. As such
the Alliance must engage and attract this talent. The good news is NATO
has a number of potential examples to draw on for potential hiring
pathways. In the U.S. the Defense Digital Service hires design and
technical experts for one-to-two "tours of duty," using their skillsets
and operate outside the traditional civil service. In the UK, strategy
and technology professionals are seconded into the Ministry of Defence,
the Department of Trade, and intelligence organizations such as GCHQ, to
provide experience or skills that may not exist within the current civil
service workforce. But providing pathways alone is not enough:
attracting this talent to apply and convincing them to join is just as
important. This requires identifying areas where they might work,
including industry, academia, and startups, and VC. At the same time,
other steps are needed. Upskilling existing NATO civilians -- among the
international and international military staff (IS and IMS) --- and
Alliance service members are needed to address this skill and
understanding gap. To do so, it is helpful to expose them to startup and
VC environments. Programs like Shift's Defense Ventures Program in the
U.S. have succeeded in building understanding between the Department of
Defense's civilian and military workforce and startups and VCs. They've
done so by bringing in high-performing defense personnel for eight-week
immersions with growing venture-backed startups or VC firms. This
cultivates the necessary connective tissue between startups, VCs, and
the military. NATO could readily follow a similar process by providing
its highest performers the opportunity to temporarily work alongside
leading North American and European startups and investors. What's Next?
**[Accelerating the development, deployment, and integration of emerging
and disruptive technologies into the strategic and tactical environments
is at the core of future NATO operations.]{.underline}** **[The
Alliance's move to build DIANA and NIF, along with incorporating the
right language into strategic documents are significant first
steps]{.underline}**. **[But building these initiatives from scratch
will require significant planning to establish the right authorities,
budget, and talent environment to enable these organizations to thrive.
In order to do so, they need to build outside of traditional NATO
structures and models while creating a differentiated talent and
organizational culture]{.underline}**.

**[The problem with forward defense, however, is that while it sounds
good, it is not clear what it would mean in practice, or how it would
play out against the many divergences and disagreements between NATO
members.]{.underline}** Instead, **[allies should embrace a strategy of
confidence-building defense]{.underline}**. To revive this late Cold War
concept, NATO's eastern members would create a highly mobile net of
dispersed artillery, while more powerful European allies would build and
supply heavy weapons depots in those countries, then prepare to rapidly
deploy significant forces in case of a crisis. This approach would
enable European allies to contribute to their own security, lessen
first-strike pressures, and avoid deepening a dangerous new security
dilemma with Russia.

N**[o matter how confident allies seem to be about NATO's current unity,
there are a number of key uncertainties that could make forward defense
difficult to implement effectively.]{.underline}** If Russia's military
continues to struggle in Ukraine, or if America's commitment to European
security falters again, **[NATO would benefit from a more flexible, less
forward strategy.]{.underline}**
