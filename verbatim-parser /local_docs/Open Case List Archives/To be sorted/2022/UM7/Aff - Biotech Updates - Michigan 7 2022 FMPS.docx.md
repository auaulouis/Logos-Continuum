[Europe has been blindsided by its biggest war in decades]{.underline}
with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Amid a raging humanitarian crisis,
[the biotech industry]{.underline} is preparing for **[increasing
economic uncertainty, cyber threats, and clinical trial
disruptions]{.underline}**. The invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces
last week caused a widespread outcry from the European community. The
geopolitical landscape has undergone a historic shift and [the tragic
consequences of the event are rippling out to the European biotech
industry]{.underline}. "The conflict in Ukraine is above all an enormous
and deplorable shock to all of us," said Miguel Forte, CEO of the
Belgian regenerative medicine specialist Bone Therapeutics. "Our
thoughts should go for those people, both in Ukraine and Russia,
directly affected by reckless and irresponsible leadership." The crisis
has many facets and the biotech industry in Europe is preparing itself
for challenges on a number of fronts. The human crisis The human cost of
the invasion is expected to be heavy, with deaths and injuries from the
conflict currently numbering in the hundreds, and a growing number of
refugees moving west. The [supply of lifesaving medications to and from
the region are already being disrupted;]{.underline} the World Health
Organization recently reported an urgent shortage of oxygen for use in
healthcare in Ukraine. Another factor at play is the [clamping down on
air travel and shipments to and from Russian companies.]{.underline}
"The primary and immediate consequences will be affecting Ukraine, but
the impact could also likely be felt in Russia and for the Russian
population," said Forte. He added that other countries could be hit
indirectly by the chaos. For life science companies, the impact will be
strong in countries close to the epicenter of the conflict, including
the Baltic states and Eastern European nations. These countries are
facing uncertainty from the neighboring crisis, and many resident
companies have employees and close contacts in Ukraine. In the
Lithuanian life sciences industry, there are "**[companies that have
business units, collaborations, and clients in Ukraine, which now has
stopped]{.underline}**," said Monika Paule, CEO of the Lithuanian gene
editing specialist CasZyme. "Companies are willing to relocate their
employees, move collaborations to other countries, but all hope to get
back to operations in Ukraine when the conflict is over." While
countries close to the conflict face large challenges, Paule sees life
science companies in these regions also playing a strong role in
alleviating the situation. "The sector is ready to help Ukraine by all
means during and after the conflict either with medical supplies or
bringing business activities back to the country," she said. [Clinical
trials caught in the middle European biotech companies now face delays
to clinical trials that are being run in Ukraine and
Russia]{.underline}. The two countries have increasingly contributed to
international studies over the last 10 years thanks to easy access to
patient populations; Forte told me there are currently **[about 500
ongoing studies in Ukraine and over three times more in
Russia]{.underline}**. The ability of the sponsors, contract research
organizations, and suppliers to keep going during the invasion is
limited. "We can expect centers in Ukraine to shut down immediately to
protect its staff and patients," said Antoine Papiernik, Managing
Partner of the investment firm Sofinnova Partners. "For Russian centers,
the integrity of data from those sites might be at stake, and trials
that are reliant on those sites will likely be affected." Overall, Forte
advises that big pharma and biotech companies focus on maximizing the
safety of clinical trial staff and participants in affected regions. To
compensate for the trial shortfall, companies may ramp up recruitment
efforts in countries away from the war zone. However, the shifts will
likely mean that Ukrainian and Russian patients lose access to many
experimental treatments. Even patients that are included in clinical
trials in affected regions could have poorer monitoring from clinicians
due to the challenging conditions. **[Financial consequences threaten
biotech stocks]{.underline}** In addition to the human tragedy caused by
the events in Ukraine, [financial aftershocks are expected]{.underline}.
Many European nations have launched a **[volley of
sanctions]{.underline}** against Russia and its ally Belarus. These
include bans on investments flowing to Russia-based banking and oil
industries in addition to the removal of some Russian banks from SWIFT,
the international financial transactions system. The current conflict
and resulting sanctions on Russia could have **[direct and psychological
repercussions on the overall business environment in
Europe]{.underline}** and **[scare off already risk-averse investors
from the biotech scene]{.underline}**. Forte sees less impact on
early-stage private investment, but bad news for public biotech firms
and life sciences companies at later stages of drug development. This
blow comes as biotech stocks are already in an anemic situation due in
part to inflation fears. "It was already **[tough in Europe since the
beginning of the year, and it might worsen even more]{.underline}**,"
said Bertrand Delsuc, founder of the business intelligence firm Biotech
Radar. "Cash is king, more than ever." Nonetheless, Papiernik is
confident that the biotech industry can pull through. "Biotech has, in
the past, demonstrated resilience compared to many other industries,"
said Papiernik. "Protecting human lives in the immediate term remains
the priority, but I hope we can also preserve the infrastructure
enabling us to develop drugs that will help patients in need over the
long term." Cyberthreats to life sciences grow Part of the modern
military arsenal is cyberattacks, and cyber threats are growing as
Europe and the US slap economic sanctions on Russia. "Several
cybersecurity agencies and government bodies have warned about Russia's
ability to retaliate asymmetrically through cyber means," said Charles
Fracchia, CEO of the US firm BioBright. "This means that **[any sectors
of]{.underline}** the EU, **[NATO, and the US economy are likely to be
targets]{.underline}**, including critical sectors such as banking,
healthcare, and life sciences. In life sciences, **[the threat is
probably highest for critical operations such as vaccine manufacturing,
biomanufacturing more broadly, and large clinical
centers."]{.underline}** Life sciences companies have been caught in the
crossfire in the past; the US big pharma MSD lost over €1B in 2017 when
it was hit by malware known as 'notPetya,' designed by Russia to target
Ukraine. It took until January 2022 for MSD to claw back damage payments
from insurers. "The notPetya attack was ostensibly not targeted at
\[MSD\], and yet, it had this enormous effect, thousands of miles away,"
said Fracchia. "\[MSD\] was big enough to withstand this, but it is
clear that our industry could not withstand a targeted attack, to say
nothing of the smaller biotech's ability to survive altogether." To
endure pressing threats from cyberattacks, biotech companies are advised
to assess their security measures and keep them up to date. Europe's
biotech industry braces itself Despite the bleak conditions in Ukraine,
there might be a silver lining in the long term. European countries are
presenting an increasingly united front against Russia's actions in
Ukraine, which could strengthen links between Europe's various life
sciences hubs, and improve the supply chains of medicines to Ukraine. In
addition, the EU is considering lowering its dependence on Russian
fossil fuels by increasing investments in renewable energy. This move
could benefit biotech companies that aim to usher in a circular
bioeconomy. For now, there are numerous ways that biotech companies can
weather the current geopolitical storm. Many biotech players have signed
a pledge to halt business activities with Russian companies and
investors. According to Paule, biotech companies can help the situation
in Ukraine by focusing on how to use their contacts and resources to
bring medical supplies to those in need, in addition to providing work
to Ukrainians coming to the rest of Europe. And, as Forte added, biotech
startups should be confident that their efforts will bear fruit in the
difficult situation, "even if at this stage there seems to be little
space for optimism."

#### Biotech revolution has the potential to create a new wave of innovation to solve for a litany of existential threats BUT effective regulation is key

A **[confluence of advances]{.underline}** in biological science and
accelerating development of computing, automation, and artificial
**[intelligence is fueling a new wave of innovation]{.underline}**.
[This Bio Revolution could have significant impact on
economies]{.underline} **[and our lives]{.underline}**, from health and
agriculture to consumer goods, and energy and materials. Some
innovations come with profound risks rooted in the self-sustaining,
self-replicating, and interconnected nature of biology that argue for a
serious and sustained debate about how this revolution should proceed.
Accidents can have major consequences---and, especially if used
unethically or maliciously, manipulating biology could become a
Pandora's box that, once opened, unleashes lasting damage to the health
of humans, ecosystems, or both. The risks are particularly acute because
many of the materials and tools are relatively cheap and accessible.
Moreover, tackling these risks is complicated by a multiplicity of
jurisdictional and cultural value systems, which makes collaboration and
coordination across countries difficult. Sidebar COVID-19 and bio
innovations However, new biological applications are already improving
our response to global challenges including climate change and
pandemics. Global responses to the novel
coronavirus---SARS-CoV-2---illustrated substantial advances in
biological science in just the past few years. The speed with which
scientists sequenced the virus's genome---weeks rather than
months---bore witness to the new world of biology described in this
research. However, [sequencing is just the start: biological innovations
are enabling the rapid introduction of clinical trials of vaccines, the
search for effective therapies, and a deep investigation of both the
origins and the transmission patterns of the virus.]{.underline} As much
as **[60 percent of the physical inputs to the global
economy]{.underline}** could, in principle, **[be produced
biologically]{.underline}**---about one-third of these inputs are
biological materials (wood or animals bred for food) and the remaining
two-thirds are nonbiological (plastics or fuels) but could potentially
be produced or substituted using biology. Therefore, it is possible that
bio innovations could impact up to 60 percent of physical inputs,
although attaining that full potential is a long way off. Even **[modest
progress toward it could transform economies]{.underline}**, societies,
and our lives, including what we eat and wear, the medicines we take,
the fuels we use, and how we construct our physical world. In human
health, at least 45 percent of the current global disease burden could
be addressed using science that is conceivable today. A pipeline of
about 400 use cases, almost all scientifically feasible today, is
already visible. These applications alone could have direct economic
impact of up to \$4 trillion a year over the next ten to 20 years. More
than half of this direct impact could be outside human health in domains
such as agriculture and food, consumer products and services, and
materials and energy production. Taking into account potential knock-on
effects, new applications yet to emerge, and additional scientific
breakthroughs, the full potential could be far larger.

With a quarter of a million dead in the United States and more than a
million globally, a massive economic toll,a and a second wave in full
swing in the northern hemisphere, the [United States and other countries
are paying a price for years of neglecting biosecurity]{.underline} as a
top-tier national security priority. For years, biosecurity has been the
poor relation of the 'other' securities for one simple reason:
policymakers and analysts failed to grasp just how [devastating a highly
transmissible new virus in a highly interconnected world could
be,]{.underline} and viewed a devastating global pandemic or
catastrophic bioterror attack as very unlikely. This article first
describes how the COVID-19 pandemic has upended such assumptions,
requiring policymakers to rethink both the potential impact and
likelihood of the most concerning biological threats (bio threats).
Based on this author's decades of experience confronting CBRN threats,c
it then makes a series of observations on the approach now needed to
counter biological threats. Some have seen this crisis as a
one-in-a-100-year event. But, as this article will outline, this is both
naïve and risks creating complacency. [Unless countries around the world
develop a comprehensive biosecurity strategy and coordinate their
efforts,]{.underline} [pandemics]{.underline} (either natural or
engineered) **[could devastate the planet every decade.]{.underline}**
The New Bio Threat Horizon The Need to Rethink Potential Impact
Policymakers around the world did not grasp just how large the impact of
a bio threat could be. Beyond the enormous human and economic impact,
the current **[pandemic]{.underline}** has ex**[posed the weakness, lack
of preparedness, and poor responsiveness of healthcare systems of even
highly developed countries]{.underline}** like the United States and the
United Kingdom. And [the virus has inflicted carnage, even
though]{.underline} SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes [COVID-19) is not
especially virulent]{.underline}. The [world may be confronted with
other viruses in the future whose combination of virulence (the harm a
pathogen does to its host), transmissibility, and other characteristics
pose much greater danger]{.underline}. While overwhelming evidence
points to SARS-CoV-2 spontaneously spreading to humans, the advances in
synthetic biology and the growth in the number of Level 3 and 4
biocontainment facilities around the world storing deadly viruses1 mean
there is also the very real possibility that in the future, bad actors
will try to engineer or steal/obtain a highly transmissible and highly
virulent virus and unleash it onto the world. Another risk is accidental
releases from such biocontainment facilities. COVID-19, a highly
transmissible but not very virulent pathogen, has had a devastating
global impact, a fact that will not have gone unnoticed by rogue states
and terror organizations. Advances in synthetic biology have created
tools that could be put to malevolent use. In the last two decades,
scientists synthesized the poliovirus from its genetic sequence,2
recreated the 1918 Spanish flu virus,3 and succeeded in modifying the
H5N1 avian flu virus so that it resulted (in a research laboratory) in
airborne transmission among mammals.4 In the future, we should think of
**[weaponized biology as no less of an existential threat to the planet
than weaponized atomic science]{.underline}**. It should also be noted
that the fear and panic that even a medium-scale bioterror attack could
create could have dangerous implications that may rival or even surpass
the immediate loss of life. The Need to Rethink Likelihood Given the
fact that in late 2019 when, as far as is known, COVID-19 cases first
started emerging in China, it had been more than a century since the
previous catastrophic outbreak (the 1918-1919 "Spanish flu" pandemic),d
it was unsurprising that many thought of such pandemics as a
one-in-a-100-year event. Such assumptions should no longer hold. The
encroachment of human settlements into areas that had previously been
sanctuaries for wildlife5 and the popularity in some parts of the world
of markets where people and wild animals are brought into proximity have
made it more likely viruses will make the species leap to human beings.e
And when they do, as the COVID-19 pandemic illustrated, the
interconnectedness of a world in which millions of people fly each day6
means they can spread very rapidly. There is also growing concern about
engineered viruses. Not only have advances in synthetic biology (SynBio)
created growing capacity for extremely dangerous viruses to be
engineered in a laboratory, but the number of people with access to
potentially dangerous 'dual use' technology has greatly expanded and
continues to expand, making malevolent use of such technology ever more
likely. In the August 2020 issue of this publication, scientists at the
U.S. Military Academy at West Point warned that: The [wide availability
of the protocols, procedures, and techniques necessary to produce and
modify living organisms combined with an exponential increase in the
availability of genetic data is leading to a revolution in science
affecting the threat landscape that can be rivaled only by the
development of the atomic bomb]{.underline}. As the technology improves,
the level of education and skills necessary to engineer biological
agents decreases. Whereas only state actors historically had the
resources to develop and employ biological weapons, SynBio is changing
the threat paradigm. The cost threshold of engineering viruses is also
lowering, with the West Point scientists warning that synthetic biology
has "placed the ability to recreate some of the deadliest infectious
diseases known well within the grasp of the state-sponsored terrorist
and the talented non-state actor."7 As already noted, another source of
vulnerability is that deadly viruses could be stolen from or escape from
a research laboratory. There are now around 50 Biosafety Level 4f
facilities around the world, where the deadliest pathogens are stored
and worked on, and this figure is set to increase in the next few
years.g This is a large increase over the last 30 years, creating bigger
risk of a breach. Of equal, if not greater concern are the thousands of
Biosafety Level 3 labs globally,8 which handle deadly pathogens like
COVID-19.9 Given what has been outlined above, the risk of a future
destructive biological attack or another devastating global pandemic
should no longer be seen as low. From this point forward, **[there
should no higher priority for the international community than
biosecurity]{.underline}**. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon Improving

#### 2\-- Only cooperating internationally with NATO prevents a biological arm's race that increases the risk of disease outbreak 

Steve **Fyffe 15,** 12-17-2015, Steve earned his Master of Journalism
degree from UC Berkeley, and served in several senior communications
roles at Stanford University \"U.S. Needs a New Approach for Governance
of Risky Research,\" No Publication,
<https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/news/us-needs-new-approach-governance-risky-research>//AL

The United States needs [to build a better governance regime for
oversight of risky biological research]{.underline} to reduce the
likelihood of a bioengineered super virus escaping from the lab or being
deliberately unleashed, according to an article from three Stanford
scholars published in the journal Science today. \"We\'ve got an
increasing number of unusually risky experiments, and we need to be more
thoughtful and deliberate in how we oversee this work,\" said co-author
David Relman, a professor of infectious diseases and co-director of
Stanford\'s Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC).
Relman said that cutting-edge bioscience and technology research has
yielded tremendous benefits, such as cheap and effective ways of
developing new drugs, vaccines, fuels and food. But he said he was
**[concerned about the growing number of labs that are developing novel
pathogens with pandemic potential]{.underline}**. For instance,
researchers at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, in their
quest to create a better model for studying human disease, recently
deployed a gene editing technique known as CRISPR-Cas9 on a respiratory
virus so that it was able to edit the mouse genome and cause cancer in
infected mice. \"They ended up creating, in my mind, a very dangerous
virus and showed others how they too could make similar kinds of
dangerous viruses,\" Relman said. Scientists in the United States and
the Netherlands, conducting so-called \"gain-of-function\" experiments,
have also created much more contagious versions of the deadly H5N1 bird
flu in the lab. Publicly available information from published
experiments like these, such as genomic sequence data, could allow
scientists to reverse engineer a virus that would be difficult to
contain and highly harmful were it to spread. And a recent spate of
high-profile accidents at U.S. government labs -- including the
mishandling of anthrax, bird flu, smallpox and Ebola samples -- has
[raised the specter of a dangerous pathogen escaping from the lab and
causing an outbreak or even a global pandemic]{.underline}. \"These
kinds of accidents can have severe consequences,\" said Megan Palmer,
CISAC senior research scholar and a co-author on the paper. \"But we
lack adequate processes and public information to assess the
significance of the benefits and risks. Unless we address this
fundamental issue, then we\'re going to continue to be reactive and make
ourselves more vulnerable to mistakes and accidents in the long term.\"
Centralizing leadership Leadership on risk management in biotechnology
has not evolved much since the mid-1970s, when pioneering scientists
gathered at the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA and established
guidelines that are still in use today. Palmer said that although
scientific self-governance is an essential element of oversight, left
unchecked, it could lead to a \"culture of invincibility over time.\"
\"There\'s [reliance on really a n**arrow set of technical experts to
assess risks**, and we **need to broaden that leadership** to be able to
account for the new types of opportunities and challenges that emerging
science and technology bring,]{.underline}\" she said. Relman described
the current system as \"piecemeal, ad hoc and uncoordinated,\" and said
that a more \"holistic\" approach that included academia, industry and
all levels of government was needed to tackle the problem. \"It\'s time
for us as a set of communities to step back and think more
strategically,\" Relman said. The [governance of \"dual use\"
tech]{.underline}nologies, which can be used for both peaceful and
offensive purposes, [poses significant challenges in the life
sciences]{.underline}, said Stanford political scientist Francis
Fukuyama, who also contributed to the paper. \"Unlike nuclear weapons,
it doesn\'t take large-scale labs,\" Fukuyama said. \"It doesn\'t take a
lot of capacity to do dangerous research on biology.\" The co-authors
recommend appointing a top-ranking government official, such as a
special assistant to the president, and a supporting committee, to
oversee safety and security in the life sciences and associated
technologies. They would **[coordinate the management of risk, including
regulatory authorities needed to ensure accountability and information
sharing]{.underline}**. \"Although many agencies right now are tasked
with worrying about safety, they have got conflicting interests that
make them not ideal for being the single point of vigilance in this
area,\" Fukuyama said. \"The National Institutes of Health is trying to
promote research but also stop dangerous research. Sometimes those two
aims run at cross-purposes. \"It\'s a big step to call for a new
regulator, because in general we have too much regulation, but we felt
there were a lot of dangers that were not being responded to in an
appropriate way.\" Improving cooperation **[Strong cooperative
international mechanisms are also needed to encourage other countries to
support responsible research]{.underline}**, Fukuyama said. \"What we
want to [avoid]{.underline} is a kind of [arms race]{.underline}
phenomenon, **[where countries are trying to compete with each other
doing risky research in this area,]{.underline}** and not wanting to
mitigate risks because of fears that other countries are going to get
ahead of them,\" he said. The co-authors also recommended investing in
research centers as a strategic way to build critical perspective and
analysis of oversight challenges as biotechnology becomes increasing
accessible.

#### Rapidly adapting innovation is the only thing that can solve for the inevitable increased risk of disease outbreak

pandemics more likely.\" Nature, vol. 584, no. 7820, 13 Aug. 2020, pp.

As [humans diminish biodiversity]{.underline} by cutting down forests
and building more infrastructure, they\'re **[increasing the risk of
disease pandemics such as COVID-19.]{.underline}** Many ecologists have
long suspected this, but a new study helps to reveal why: while some
species are going extinct, those that tend to survive and thrive \--
**[rats and bats]{.underline}**, for instance \-- are more **[likely to
host potentially dangerous pathogens]{.underline}** that can make the
jump to humans. The analysis of around 6,800 ecological communities on 6
continents adds to a growing body of evidence that connects trends in
human development and biodiversity loss to disease outbreaks \-- but
stops short of projecting where new disease outbreaks might occur.
\"We\'ve been warning about this for decades,\" says Kate Jones, an
ecological modeller at University College London and an author on the
study, published on 5 August in Nature 1 . \"Nobody paid any
attention.\" Jones is one of a cadre of researchers that has long been
delving into **[relationships among biodiversity, land use and emerging
infectious diseases]{.underline}**. Their work has mostly flown below
the radar, but now, as the world reels from the COVID-19 pandemic,
efforts to map risks in communities across the globe and to project
where diseases are most likely to emerge are taking centre stage. Last
week, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and
Ecosystem Services (IPBES) hosted an online workshop on the nexus
between biodiversity loss and emerging diseases. The organization\'s
goal now is to produce an expert assessment of the science underlying
that connection ahead of a United Nations summit in New York that\'s
planned for September, where governments are expected to make new
commitments to preserve biodiversity. Others are calling for a more
wide-ranging course of action. On 24 July, an interdisciplinary group of
scientists, including virologists, economists and ecologists, published
an essay in Science 2 , arguing that governments can help reduce the
risk of future pandemics by controlling deforestation and curbing the
wildlife trade, which involves the sale and consumption of wild \-- and
often rare \-- animals that can host dangerous pathogens. **[Most
efforts to prevent the spread of new diseases tend to focus on vaccine
development, early diagnosis and containment,]{.underline}** but that\'s
like treating the symptoms without addressing the underlying cause, says
Peter Daszak, a zoologist at the non-governmental organization EcoHealth
Alliance in New York, who chaired the IPBES workshop. He says COVID-19
has helped to clarify the need to investigate biodiversity\'s role in
pathogen transmission. The latest work by Jones\'s team bolsters the
case for action, Daszak says. \"We\'re looking for ways to shift
behaviour that would directly benefit biodiversity and reduce health
risks.\" Concentrating risk Previous research has shown that outbreaks
of diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bird
influenza that cross over from animals to humans have increased in the
past few decades3 , 4 . This phenomenon is likely to be the direct
result of increased contact between humans, wildlife and livestock, as
people move into undeveloped areas. These interactions happen more
frequently on the frontier of human expansion because of changes to the
natural landscape and increased encounters with animals. A study
published in April by researchers at Stanford University in California
found that deforestation and habitat fragmentation in Uganda increased
direct encounters between primates and people, as primates ventured out
of the forest to raid crops and people ventured in to collect wood5 .
But a key question over the past decade has been whether the decline in
biodiversity that **[inevitably accompanies human expansion on the rural
frontier increases the pool of pathogens that can make the jump from
animals to humans]{.underline}**. Work by Jones and others6 suggests
that the answer in many cases is yes, because a loss in biodiversity
usually results in a few species replacing many \-- and these species
tend to be the ones hosting pathogens that can spread to humans. For
their latest analysis, Jones and her team compiled more than 3.2 million
records from several hundred ecological studies at sites around the
world, ranging from native forests to cropland to cities. They found
that the populations of species known to host diseases transmissible to
humans \-- including 143 mammals such as bats, rodents and various
primates \-- increased as the landscape changed from natural to urban,
and as biodiversity generally decreased. The next step for Jones\'s team
is to examine the likelihood of disease transmission to the human
population. The group has already made this type of evaluation for Ebola
virus outbreaks in Africa, creating risk maps based on development
trends, the presence of probable host species, and socio-economic
factors that determine the pace at which a virus might spread once it
enters the human population7 . The group\'s risk maps accurately
captured where outbreaks occurred in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) in the past few years, suggesting that it is possible to
understand and project risks on the basis of relationships between
factors such as land use, ecology, climate and biodiversity. Some
researchers urge caution when communicating that biodiversity hotspots
are where outbreaks are likely to occur. \"My worry, frankly, is that
people are going to cut down the forests more if this is where they
think the next pandemic is going to come from,\" says Dan Nepstad, a
tropical ecologist and founder of the Earth Innovation Institute based
in San Francisco, California, a non-profit organization that campaigns
for sustainable development. Efforts to preserve biodiversity will only
work, he says, if they address the economic and cultural factors that
drive deforestation and the rural poor\'s dependency on hunting and
trading wild animals. Ibrahima Socé Fall, an epidemiologist and head of
emergency operations at the World Health Organization in Geneva,
Switzerland, agrees that understanding the ecology \-- as well as the
social and economic trends \-- of the rural frontier will be crucial to
projecting the risk of future disease outbreaks. \"[Sustainable
development is crucial]{.underline},\" he says. \"If we continue to have
this level of deforestation, disorganized mining and unplanned
development, [we are going to have more outbreaks]{.underline}.\"
Coordinating efforts One message that the IPBES\'s upcoming report is
likely to deliver is that scientists and policymakers need to treat the
rural frontier more holistically, addressing issues of public health,
the environment and sustainable development in tandem. In the wake of
the COVID-19 pandemic, many scientists and conservationists have
emphasized curbing the wildlife trade \-- an industry worth an estimated
US\$20 billion annually in China, where the first coronavirus infections
appeared. China has temporarily suspended its trade. But Daszak says the
industry is just one piece in a larger puzzle that involves hunting,
livestock, land use and ecology. Wildlife markets like this one in Bali,
Indonesia, sustain the livelihoods of many people. But they are also
under scrutiny as hotspots for pathogen transmission. Credit: Amilia
Roso/The Sydney Morning Herald via Getty Live animals, including local
wildlife, are on sale in Bali, Indonesia \"Ecologists should be working
with infectious-disease researchers, public-health workers and medics to
track environmental change, assess the risk of pathogens crossing over
and reduce risky human activities,\" he says. Daszak was an author of
last month\'s essay in Science , which argued that governments could
substantially reduce the risk of future pandemics such as COVID-19 by
investing in efforts to curb deforestation and the wildlife trade, as
well as in efforts to monitor, prevent and control new virus outbreaks
from wildlife and livestock. The team estimated that the cost of these
actions would ring in at \$22 billion to \$33 billion annually,
including \$19.4 billion for ending trade in wild meat in China \-- a
step that not all experts think is desirable or necessary \-- and up to
\$9.6 billion to help curb tropical deforestation. The total investment
would be two orders of magnitude less than the \$5.6-trillion price tag
estimated for the COVID-19 pandemic, the team estimates. Fall says
**[the key is to align efforts by government and international
agencie]{.underline}**s focused on public health, animal health, the
environment and sustainable development. The latest Ebola outbreak in
the DRC, which began in 2018 and ended last month, had its roots not

#### Disease causes extinction

[The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which is causing COVID 19 disease, has
taught us unexpected lessons about the dangers of human extinction
through highly contagious and lethal diseases]{.underline}. As the COVID
19 pandemic is now being controlled by various isolation measures,
therapeutics and vaccines, it became clear that [our current lifestyle
and societal functions may not be sustainable in the long]{.underline}
term. We now have to start thinking and planning on how to face the next
dangerous pandemic, not just overcoming the one that is upon us now. [Is
there any evidence that even worse pandemics could strike us in the near
future and threaten the existence of the human race? The answer is
unequivocally yes]{.underline}. It is not necessary to get infected by
viruses of bats, pangolins and other exotic animals that live in remote
forests in order to be in danger. [Creditable scientific evidence
indicates that the human gut microbiota harbor billions of viruses which
are capable of affecting the function of vital human organs such as the
immune system, lung, brain, liver, kidney, heart etc. It is possible
that the development of pathogenic variants in the gut can lead to
contagious viruses which can cause pandemics]{.underline}, leading to
destruction of vital organs, causing death or various [debilitating
diseases such as blindness, respiratory, liver, heart and kidney
failures]{.underline}. These [diseases could result n the complete
shutdown of our civilization and probably the extinction of human
race]{.underline}. In this essay, I will first provide a few independent
pieces of scientific facts and then combine this information to come up
with some (but certainly not all) hypothetical scenarios that could
cause human race misery, even extinction. I hope that these scary
scenarios will trigger preventative measures that could reverse or delay
the projected adverse outcomes. Introduction Le Chatelier's Principle:
Named after the French chemist, Le Chatelier's principle posits that
"When an external stress (change in pressure, temperature or
concentration) is applied to a system in chemical equilibrium, the
equilibrium will change in such a way as to reduce the effect of the
stress". In other words, a change in a system will evoke a
counter-change, which will bring the equilibrium to a new point. This
principle operates with almost every human or other activity. For
example, it is known that when fruit production in the Serengeti
ecosystem is reduced, the number of elephants, who feed on these fruits,
is reduced proportionally. In the context of this essay, I hypothesize
that human-made changes in climate, the atmosphere, waters, soil and all
other planet-living organisms, will likely evoke counter-changes that
may be highly consequential to human life. Due to the complexity of our
ecosystem, humans do not know exactly how these dramatic changes will
affect them in the long run. Consequently, they choose to disregard them
because adjustments cost money and convenience or loss of
well-established pleasures. The earth is changing rapidly What is
changing on earth that could induce a potentially catastrophic
counter-change? The answer is everything is changing\*, from the living
inhabitants (humans, other species and plants), to the atmosphere,
water, soil, climate, etc.

#### Creating room for growth in the biotech sector is key to key to [economic resilience]{.underline}\-\--it creates a [virtuous cycle]{.underline} of post-COVID growth

**[Biotech]{.underline}** is now a **[major contributor to the US
economy]{.underline}**. When considered as an industry in itself,
biotech and its economic impact rivals mining, utilities, chemicals and
computing and electronics. Internationally[, at least 20 countries have
articulated strategies that explicitly identify biotech as critical to
their future economic and employment growth]{.underline} (1). Given this
focus on economic development, it is crucial to better define the
current systemic role of biotech. Moreover, ongoing discussions of
funding and investment, benefit and risk, and opportunity and threat all
would benefit from a more detailed understanding of where biotech is and
where it is headed. In this article, I use data collected from a variety
of public and private sources to assemble an initial economic assessment
of biotech in the United States as a test case for an analysis at the
global level. What emerges is a picture of a [sector already making a
remarkable and accelerating transformation of the US
economy.]{.underline} By my estimate**[, total domestic US revenues
generated by biotech in 2012 reached]{.underline}** at least \$324
billion\--the equivalent of **[\>2% of]{.underline}** gross domestic
product (**[GDP]{.underline}**; for comparison, see Supplementary Table
1 for a list of selected industries and their contributions to US GDP).
**[The estimate is intended to be conservative; the actual total could
be 10-20% higher.]{.underline}** Total revenues comprise three biotech
subsectors: biologics (drugs), at \$91 billion; crops (and seeds), at
\$128 billion; and industrial products (biofuels, enzymes, biomaterials
and biochemicals), at \>\$105 billion. Over the past decade, [aggregate
revenues have grown on average at annual rates \>10%, much faster than
the economy as a whole.]{.underline} Remarkably, biotech revenue growth
was the equivalent of \>5% of annual US GDP growth every year between
2007 and 2012. It is difficult to project exactly how large the biotech
sector might ultimately become, but the trends indicate **[that
biological technologies are likely to generate an increasing share of

Crisis of the Old Order"

A large portion of [[the burden of]{.mark} creating and [maintaining
order]{.mark} at the regional or global level [will fall on the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. This is inevitable for
several reasons, only one of which is that the United States is and will
likely remain the most powerful country in the world for decades to
come. The corollary to this point is that [no other country or group of
countries has either the capacity or the mind-set to build a global
order]{.underline}. [Nor can order ever be expected to emerge
automatically]{.underline}; there is no invisible hand in the
geopolitical marketplace. Again, a large part of the burden (or, more
positively, opportunity) falls on the principal power of the day. There
is more than a little self-interest at stake. [The United States cannot
remain aloof, much less unaffected by a world in disarray. Globalization
is more reality than choice. At the regional level, the United States
actually faces the opposite problem, namely, that certain actors do have
the mind-set and means to shape an order. The problem is that their
views of order are in part or in whole incompatible with U.S. interests.
Examples would include Iran and ISIS in the Middle East, China in Asia,
and Russia in Europe]{.underline}. It will not be an easy time for the
United States. [The sheer number and range of challenges is daunting.
There are a large number of actors and forces to contend with.
Alliances]{.underline}, normally created in opposition to some country
or countries, [may not be as useful a vehicle in a world in which not
all foes are always foes and not all friends are always
friendly]{.underline}. [Diplomacy will count for a great deal; there
will be a premium on dexterity. Consultations that aim to affect the
actions of other governments and their leaders are likely to matter more
than negotiations that aim to solve problems. Another reality is that
the United States for all its power cannot impose order.]{.underline}
Partially this reflects what might be called structural realities,
namely, that [[no country can contend with]{.mark} global challenges on
its own given the very nature of these challenges]{.underline}. [The
United States could reduce its carbon footprint dramatically, but
[the]{.mark} effect on [global climate]{.mark} would be modest if India
and China failed to follow suit]{.underline}. [Similarly, on its own the
United States cannot [maintain]{.mark} a world [trading]{.mark} system
or successfully [combat terrorism or disease]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Adding to these realities are resource limits[. The United States cannot
provide all the troops [or]{.mark} dollars to [maintain order in the
Middle East]{.mark} and [Europe and Asia]{.mark} and South Asia. There
is simply too much capability in too many hands. Unilateralism is rarely
a serious foreign policy option. Partners are essential.]{.underline}
That is one of the reasons why sovereign obligation is a desirable
compass for U.S. foreign policy. Earlier I made the case that it
represents realism for an era of globalization. It also is a natural
successor to containment, the doctrine that guided the United States for
the four decades of the Cold War. There are basic differences, however.
Containment was about holding back more than bringing in and was
designed for an era when rivals were almost always adversaries and in
which the challenges were mostly related to classical geopolitical
competition.1 Sovereign obligation, by contrast, is designed for a world
in which sometime rivals are sometime partners and in which collective
efforts are required to meet common challenges. Up to this point, we
have focused on what the United States needs to do in the world to
promote order. That is what one would expect from a book about
international relations and American foreign policy. [But a focus on
foreign policy is not enough]{.underline}. [National security is a coin
with two sides, and what the United States does at home, what is
normally thought of as belonging to the domestic realm, is every bit as
much a part of national security as foreign policy.]{.underline} It is
best to understand the issue as guns and butter rather than guns versus
butter. When it comes to the domestic side, the argument is
straightforward. **[[In order to lead]{.mark} and compete and act
effectively in the world, [the United States needs to put its house in
order]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I have written on what this entails in a
book titled Foreign Policy Begins at Home.2 This was sometimes
interpreted as suggesting a turn away from foreign policy. It was
nothing of the sort. [Foreign policy begins at home, but it ends there
only at the country's peril]{.underline}.3 Earlier I mentioned that [the
United States has few unilateral options]{.underline}, that there are
few if any things it can do better alone than with others. [The
counterpart to this claim is that the world cannot come up with the
elements of a working order absent the United States]{.underline}. [The
United States is not sufficient, but it is **necessary**]{.underline}.
It is also true that [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [cannot
lead]{.mark} or act effectively in the world [if it does not have a
**strong domestic foundation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [National
[security]{.mark} inevitably [requires]{.mark} significant amounts of
human, physical, and financial [resources]{.mark} to draw
on]{.underline}. **[The [better the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates

and [needs]{.mark} to do abroad [without igniting]{.mark} a divisive and

#### Only opening communication on biotech increase's NATO's soft power which increases its global diplomatic ability

Constraints of 21st Century." MEF University Of Political Science And

The term "public diplomacy" contains the word "diplomacy." As an
instrument of statecraft, diplomacy has long been used as a tool by
states in their relations with other states. Although it does not have a
commonly agreed-upon definition, diplomacy is generally considered to be
the conduct and management of relations, through peaceful means, by and
among international actors. The major international actors are states,
and diplomacy mainly involves relations among states or between states,
international organizations and other international actors. Today,
diplomacy continues to be conducted mainly by states, but also includes
international and regional organizations, multinational corporations,
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and even individuals. Since the
number and types of actors involved in international affairs have
expanded, and the interaction among these actors has increased, the
agenda and conduct of diplomacy has evolved in line with these
developments. The expansion of intergovernmental and regional
organizations does not mean the weakening of diplomacy, but rather a
shift from traditional state diplomacy to new forms. Especially in
today's world, international and regional organizations generally
compete for better visibility, and they consider their image, identity
and brand important. As a collective defense and security organization,
[NATO has defined itself as the security branch of an institution of
liberal-democratic norms and values]{.underline}, and has embraced the
main principles of the Western world since its foundation in April 1949.
Nonetheless, after the end of the Cold War and the disappearance of the
Soviet threat, there emerged deep disagreements about the future role of
the Alliance. In today's global information environment, it is
**[apparent that NATO needs to strengthen its communication tools and
approaches]{.underline}**, consider public audiences and develop its
agenda setting according to the current communication challenges and
opportunities. Accordingly, the main purpose of this paper is to
understand and interpret the evolution of NATO's public diplomacy
efforts, taking into account the opportunities and limitations of
today's globalized environment. Public diplomacy is based on the ability
of states and non-state actors to better explain their values to the
world. **[It concentrates particularly on "soft power" tools such as
science]{.underline}**, art, culture, sports and media that enable
interaction between societies. As an organization widely associated with
security and defense issues, it is important to understand how NATO
responds to the developments of today's diplomatic As an organization
widely associated with security and defense issues, it is important to
understand how NATO responds to the developments of today's diplomatic
trends with its public diplomacy and communication activities. Cansu
GÜLEÇ 102 trends with its public diplomacy and communication activities.
Since technology has changed and evolved, NATO's communication
strategies must adjust to new types of networks and platforms. Having
recently celebrated its 70th anniversary, and now in its 72nd year of
existence, the Alliance is seeking to develop a contemporary
communication policy and to implement it by means of new mechanisms. In
this framework, this paper will first present a working definition of
the concept of public diplomacy; next, the historical evolution of
NATO's public diplomacy agenda will be evaluated. Then, NATO's
coordination activities, its values, its practical means of
communication and their expected impact will be discussed. The aim of
this study is to explore the effects of the opportunities and challenges
of the contemporary international environment on NATO's public diplomacy
efforts. Definition and Evolution of Public Diplomacy Diplomacy is
derived from a Greek word diploma that means an official document or
state paper. The Oxford dictionary defines diplomacy as "management of a
country's affairs by its agents abroad and the activity of managing
relations between different countries."1 As a key process of
communication and negotiation in world politics and an important policy
device used by international actors, the term diplomacy has been given a
number of definitions in International Relations discipline. While some
definitions associate diplomacy with the activity of engaging in foreign
policy, others use the term to refer to a tool or technique of foreign
policy. Accordingly, the term is therefore described as "a foreign
policy instrument for establishing and developing peaceful relations
between the governments of the various states through the use of
intermediaries mutually recognized by the respective parties." 2 As one
of the oldest instruments of world politics, diplomacy is seen as an
art, specifically the art of managing relations among sovereign actors.
Originally, diplomacy was considered an instrument used by states in
order to deal with other states. After the establishment of
international and regional organizations, these entities too became
involved in diplomatic practices. It can be stated that **[communication
is the focus of diplomacy in managing relations among different
international actors]{.underline}**. In order to create effective
communication mechanisms among different players, diplomacy is
[supported by an established body of rules]{.underline} and practices.3
Since diplomacy is based on the conduct of relationships using peaceful
means, these rules and practices should be implemented by governments
and other international actors alike. In practice, diplomacy aims to
create a favorable image of the global actor. Modern communication, in
that sense, functions to shape views and perceptions around the world.
NATO and Public Diplomacy: Opportunities and Constraints of 21st Century
103 In contemporary global environment, although states and governments
remain the main actors within the international system, the number and
variety of actors, from governments to regional and intergovernmental
organizations, multinational corporations and NGOs, have been rapidly
expanding. In tandem, the domain and scope of the diplomacy have
expanded to involve different sectors that expand beyond traditional
high foreign policy issues. Globalization with its the complex web of
interdependence has increased the range of negotiations, especially in
multilateral meetings.4 Under these circumstances, diplomatic activities
require the use of diplomatic tools to directly influence the people of
nations as well. In that respect, public diplomacy can be regarded as
one of the efficient means of diplomacy in use today. Thanks to this
tool, relations between states and global actors progress more
peacefully, with inclusion of public opinion alongside that of official
representatives. The term 'public diplomacy' was first coined in 1965 by
Edmund Gullion. According to Gullion, public diplomacy is concerned with
the influence of social viewpoints have on the formulation and
implementation of foreign policy.5 Indeed, the rise of the concept of
public diplomacy is best understood in terms of its relationship with
soft power. As mentioned above, with the increase in numbers and types
of actors, with the expansion of the subject matter or content of
diplomacy, and with the change in the modes, types, and techniques of
diplomacy, a new terminology of Public Diplomacy as the language of
prestige and international image has brought the concepts like soft
power and branding to the nation states' agenda.6 In IR discipline,
power is generally defined as the ability to affect others to obtain
desired outcomes. According to Joseph Nye, others' behavior can be
affected in three main ways: threats of coercion; inducements and
payments; and attraction that makes others want what you want.7 While
discussing the concept, Nye puts a distinction between hard power and
soft power.8 The former is achieved through military threat or use, and
by economic menace or reward. However, in the 21st century, under the
influence of technological developments and globalization, international
politics is also changing, and a state cannot address its problems or
achieve all of its goals by acting alone. In this environment, it is
important to set the agenda and attract others in world politics, as it
is not always feasible or desirable to force them to change by means of
threats or the use of military or economic weapons. In that sense,
'[soft power' co-opts people]{.underline} rather than coerces them. Nye
coined the 'soft power' as "[the ability of affect others to obtain the
outcomes one wants through attraction rather than coercion or payment."9
While military force remains the fundamental form of power in
international system, abilities like communication, organizational and
institutional skills, have also become important instruments in today's
global environment of growing interdependence]{.underline}.10 Diplomacy
is a crucial instrument enabling allies to cooperate, and adversaries to
resolve conflicts without Cansu GÜLEÇ 104 using force. International
actors communicate, influence one another, bargain and adapt their
differences through diplomacy. As a key process of communication and
negotiation, diplomacy is used as a significant policy instrument by
global actors. Today, diplomacy takes place between actors with a wide
range of authority, power, tools and impact. A country's soft power
capacity has a crucial role in the success of an actor's public
diplomacy as much as efficacy of its policies; indeed, a country's
political values, culture and foreign policies are important indicators
of its soft power.11 Credibility is the significant source of soft
power. Since reputation has become one of the main objectives of today's
global actors, they make efforts to increase their credibility around
the world. States compete with other states, and also with other actors
including media, NGOs, international organizations and other networks in
the quest to gain and maintain credibility.12 Public diplomacy is about
relationship building. It is about understanding the requirements of
other countries, cultures and people; communicating one's perspectives;
correcting misperceptions; and searching areas of common ground.13 Nye
defines public diplomacy as an instrument that governments use to
mobilize these resources to communicate with and attract the public of
other countries, rather than only their governments. Public diplomacy
seeks to attract by bringing attention to potential areas of
commonality, interest and attraction through broadcasting, supporting
cultural initiatives and organizing exchanges.14 The main distinction
between traditional and public diplomacy is that the latter involves a
much broader group of people on both sides, and a wider set of interests
that go beyond those of the government of the day.15 **[Listening,
advocacy,]{.underline}** cultural **[diplomacy, exchange, and
international broadcasting]{.underline}** are five components of public
diplomacy.16 Understanding, planning and engagement are also very
important concepts for the establishment of powerful relationships. In
the 20th century, public diplomacy was considered a state-based tool
used by foreign ministries and other governmental entities to engage and
persuade foreign publics with the aim of influencing their governments.
Today, public diplomacy has become an instrument used by states,
associations of states, and some sub-state and non-state actors to
understand cultures, attitudes and behavior; to build and manage
relationships; and to influence thoughts and mobilize actions to advance
their interests and values.17 **[A country's soft power capacity has a
crucial role in the success of an actor's public
diplomacy]{.underline}** as much as efficacy of its policies; indeed, a
country's political values, culture and foreign policies are important
indicators of its soft power. NATO and Public Diplomacy: Opportunities
and Constraints of 21st Century 105 Public diplomacy is a process of
creating an overall international image that strengthens a country's
ability in order to achieve diplomatic success. This is also important
for "propaganda." Propaganda is an attempt to influence another country
through emotional techniques rather than minds by creating fear, doubt,
sympathy, anger or other feelings. In order to change or influence other
actors' opinions, actions or policies, propaganda also operates by means
of symbols, such as words, gestures, banners, monuments, music,
clothing, etc. Propaganda acquired negative connotations in the 20th
century, although it was an effective tool of foreign policy during the
First and Second World Wars, as well as the Cold War. During these
times, propaganda was associated with manipulating populations at home
and abroad.18 Unlike public diplomacy, propaganda is generally not
interested in dialogue or any meaningful form of
relationship-building.19 The main objective of the propaganda is to
influence opinion and behavior of its targeted audience. Although both
public diplomacy and propaganda intend to convince people to create a
favorable image, the distinction between propaganda and public diplomacy
lies in the pattern of communication. In that respect, public diplomacy
goes beyond propaganda. It is comprised of what is actually said and
done by political figures, as well as practices of promotion and other
forms of public relations that are utilized by the business sector.20 In
other words, public diplomacy, like propaganda, is about creating
influence. However, unlike propaganda, that influence is not a one-way
street from the speakers to their target audience. Public diplomacy is
perceived as a two-way street with a process of mutual influence, in
which the foreign public is seen as an active participant.21 In that
sense, the objective of public diplomacy is not propaganda, but building
a strategic language of communication based on objective facts and
truth. Nye asserts that if public diplomacy degenerates into propaganda,
it not only fails to convince, but can undercut soft power. Since soft
power depends upon an understanding of the minds of others, an efficient
public diplomacy is regarded as a two-way street.22 After the end of the
Second World War in 1945, a new type of conflict emerged between the
U.S. and the Soviet Union, known as the Cold War. The Cold War was based
on a contest of ideologies that divided the world into a bipolar
competition characterized by a war of words and the threatened use of
nuclear weapons, rather than their actual use. In that era, the idea of
nuclear war was ever-present in the minds of the international public.
U.S.-Soviet relations became the main global, political agenda, and the
erection of the Berlin Wall in 1961 became the symbol of a world
separated by the "Iron Curtain."23 Moreover, in both the U.S. and the
Soviet Union, and in their alliance blocs of NATO and the Warsaw Pact,
the objective was to convince people that fear of the enemy was genuine,
legitimate and justified. This, in turn, would legitimate and justify
the need to sustain a Cansu GÜLEÇ 106 nuclear arsenal that would have to
be at least equal to that of the other side, although there might never
be a use for it. This climate of fear was also played out in the media.
Propaganda exploited these fears, and the 'other side' had always to be
portrayed as aggressive, militaristic and repressive.24 In other words,
during the Cold War period, propaganda had a special importance in the
foreign policy objectives of the U.S. and the USSR. Both used an
organized form of propaganda activities with one-sided, deformed
messages, mainly based on their respective ideologies; while the U.S.
underlined the material prosperity of the Western world and the
desirability of individual freedoms, the USSR emphasized the adverse
sides of capitalism. This kind of propaganda sought to stress the
admirable side of one's own country, while denigrating the other side by
focusing on specific issues.25 In order to shape public attitudes all
over the world toward their respective ideologies, the main tools used
by the two superpowers were international broadcasting and radio
stations, such as the Voice of America (VOA), Radio Liberty and Radio
Free Europe on the American side, and Radio Moscow on the Soviet side.26
The U.S. government developed a number of propaganda channels through
the work of the United States Information Agency (USIA), and promoted
the universal attractiveness of such American brands as Coca-Cola, Levi
jeans and McDonalds, as well as American music and Hollywood films. With
the end of the bipolar world, the international environment faced new
problems with the rapid expansion in the number and scope of
interactions. Contemporary challenges emerged in a new, global
communication that had different features from that of the Cold War
period. Under these circumstances, it can be claimed that the end of the
Cold War made public diplomacy much more important. The spread of
democracy, media proliferation and the expansion of global NGOs changed
the nature of power and now exert much more influence on the freedom of
action of national governments than ever before.27 With these
developments, public diplomacy has been used in non-traditional forms
with new participants, such as non-state actors; with new sorts of
relations between state and non-state actors; and with new goals, such
as gaining the support of foreign actors to maintain profound relations
rather than using propaganda to influence them. The **[mechanisms used
by these actors to communicate with the world public are supported by
new, real-time, global tech]{.underline}**nologies, especially by the
Internet. These new technologies have blurred the formerly rigid lines
between the domestic and international news spheres. A new emphasis has
emerged on people-to-people contact for mutual enlightenment, with
international actors playing the role of facilitator. Consequently,
instead of top-down messaging, "relationship-building" has become the
chief task of the new public diplomacy.28 NATO and Public Diplomacy:
Opportunities and Constraints of 21st Century 107 Although public
diplomacy is accepted as a two-way relationship, there is no agreement
on how to measure its impact and success, as there is no clear variable
that shows the political outcome of public diplomacy initiatives.
However, the establishment of daily communications with the target
audience to explain foreign policy decisions and the enhancement of
lasting relationships with target groups, including individuals, may
help to build relationships and to foster understanding. Since public
diplomacy begins with listening, one of the pathways of understanding
the success of its activities is to measure "public opinion" to see the
largest impact of the attraction. In that sense, successful public
diplomacy projects increase favorable public opinion toward the
practitioner actor. Another pathway for understanding an initiative's
success is "agenda setting," which determines the issues covered in the
media or discussed in the target population. "Framing" is yet another
pathway that changes the media coverage of the practitioner actor's
foreign policy in the host country.29 In sum, public diplomacy increases
people's familiarity with one's country or international institution by
making them think about it, update their image of it and change negative
opinions. It also increases people's appreciation of one's country or
international institution by creating positive perceptions, getting
others to see issues of global importance from the same perspective.
Moreover, it also helps strengthen ties by getting people to understand
and subscribe to common values. More importantly, it influences people
and/ or politicians by making them favored partners.30

[depend]{.mark}]{.underline} in large [measure **[on]{.underline}**
**[our ability to work diplomatically across the
world]{.underline}**]{.mark} in this multi-front struggle. As a former
career Foreign Service officer, I have spent four decades of my
professional life representing the United States overseas and teaching
about America's role as the indispensable power in the international
arena. For much of that time, [the nation leaned heavily on its
unmatched military might]{.underline}---[during the Cold War, after
9/11, and in the Afghan and Iraq wars. **[Now]{.mark}**]{.underline},
with the spread of the coronavirus to every inhabited continent,
**[[diplomacy's time has come in the reconstruction of a more stable and
better world]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Unfortunately, restoring the role
of U.S. diplomacy won't be easy. One early casualty of the pandemic is
our plummeting credibility as the unmatched global power. For the first
time since World War II, America has chosen not to lead in confronting a
quintessentially global threat. With American energy and confidence in
short supply, President Donald Trump is a spectral figure on the world
stage as nations struggle to contain the virus. Instead of leading the
G-20 major economies against the contagion, the world has watched an
American president castigate China for birthing the "Wuhan Virus," pin
the blame for the failed response on the World Health Organization,
and---as one of my European students lamented---fail even to offer a
simple word of sympathy in all those endless news conferences to those
dying in Italy and Spain and other bedrock allies. Former Secretary of
State Colin Powell has long maintained that [America should place its
diplomats out in front]{.underline} ("on point" in the military
vernacular), [with]{.underline} the [armed forces]{.underline} in
reserve, [to be used only when diplomacy fails]{.underline}. Powell's
dictum is an important reminder of how the United States should seek to
lead in this time of pandemic, for the [coronavirus is only one of many
among a new type of threat that requires us to
**[lead]{.mark}**]{.underline} as much
**[[through]{.underline}]{.mark}** the power of
**[[diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}** as through that of the military.
Many of the students I teach point to [transnational threats that affect
every nation]{.underline} and person on earth as our greatest
challenges: [**[climate change]{.underline}**, **[food and water
shortages]{.underline}**, **[narcotics and crime
cartels]{.underline}**,]{.mark} the lack of **[[cyber
security]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and
**[[pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}** top the list. [We [cannot
succeed]{.mark} in containing them [without]{.mark}]{.underline} forming
**[[diplomatic alliances]{.underline}]{.mark}** among governments,
universities, foundations, businesses, and citizens. This new brand of
diplomacy is not an alternative to the military but its logical partner
in the twenty-first century American arsenal. The military remains
essential to fight terrorists, and to counter rivals Russia and China
and outlaw governments in North Korea and Iran, but even in these cases
we have to have robust diplomacy to achieve our aims. Even if we
deployed the full might of the U.S. military to eliminate the North
Korean and Iranian nuclear programs, and the regimes that support them,
does anyone believe that would, by itself, "solve" the problem? Even in
those cases, deft, multilateral diplomacy will have to play a lead
role---as recent experience has shown. **[[We can no longer default to
force alone]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as we have done so often since 9/11.
A Foreign Service for 2030 AMERICA'S DIPLOMATIC EFFECTIVENESS rests, in
large part, on the women and men of the U.S. Foreign Service---more than
11,000 career officials in more than 280 embassies and consulates and at
the State Department in Washington, D.C. They are our primary interface
with foreign governments, businesses, and citizens. They adjudicate
immigrant and non-immigrant visas and refugee admissions to the United
States. They help American businesses overcome barriers to foreign trade
and investment. They manage difficult war and peace challenges in every
corner of the world---from daily challenges to the most intricate,
strategic matters vital to our national security and prosperity.
Diplomatic collaboration also underpins our ability to advance the more
positive scientific, technological, and societal trends that can sustain
the historic alleviation of poverty worldwide, promote women's rights,
and realize the promise of a carbon-free economy. Just when we need to
turn to diplomacy, however, the Foreign Service is experiencing one of
the greatest crises in its long history. Some of the damage has been
caused by prior Democratic as well as Republican administrations. The
United States is the only major country that fills a third or more of
its ambassadorial assignments with political appointees, often poorly
qualified, from outside the career ranks---often depriving the country
of the advantages it could secure with expert, professional, nonpartisan
diplomatic representation around the world. That mistake has only
accelerated, with the current administration appointing the lowest
percentage of career ambassadors in more than half a century. Former
generals and admirals have been appointed to ambassadorships that would
otherwise be filled---as they should be---by civilian officers. The
politicization and militarization of our foreign policy by both parties
is a genuine problem. More broadly, the Foreign Service has been
substantially weakened and is in need of major repair. Even as the Trump
administration's budget requests for the Department of Defense rose from
\$686 billion to as high as \$718 billion during its first two years, it
sought to slash the State Department's budget by up to a third. The
administration fired several of America's most senior and experienced
diplomats early in 2017 and sidelined countless others, triggering an
exodus of officers of every rank. The president himself has castigated
career diplomats as the "Deep State." Unsurprisingly, morale has crashed
and young Americans' applications for the Foreign Service have fallen to
just under 10,000 from a high of 31,000 in 2003---a worrisome indicator
that our nation's ability to attract superb diplomatic talent is being
eroded. Re-Imagining American Diplomacy THE KENNEDY SCHOOL launched an
ambitious, nonpartisan initiative this winter---A New American Diplomacy
for the 21st Century---to address these concerns and spark a national
conversation about the future of the Foreign Service. I am working with
former Foreign Service colleagues, Ambassadors Nancy McEldowney, Marc
Grossman, and Marcie Ries, to issue a major public report after the
November presidential election. We have organized online meetings with
hundreds of current and former officials, business and nonprofit
leaders, and everyday citizens to discuss ways to strengthen the career
service. American diplomacy needs a major generational update. Since
9/11, Congress and three administrations have reformed the U.S. military
and intelligence services and created the Department of Homeland
Security. But collectively, they did little to re-imagine diplomacy's
role in the American arsenal. During the last century, there have been
just three efforts to modernize the U.S. diplomatic corps: in 1924,
1946, and 1980 (when Congress passed the last major State Department
Authorization Act). In our vastly altered geo-strategic environment, 40
years later, it is time to renew the mission of the Foreign Service.
Barack Obama, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Mahmoud Abbas, September 22, 2009,
at the Waldorf Astoria, New York City Photograph by John
Angelillo-Pool/Getty Images We can mine America's long diplomatic
history for inspiration. Drawing on my own experience, I recall, as a
young intern at the U.S. embassy in Mauritania, seeing first-hand the
respect and influence President Jimmy Carter earned as the first U.S.
leader to make Africa a priority. A decade later, when I served at the
National Security Council with responsibility for the Soviet Union, I
witnessed President George H.W. Bush negotiate the peaceful end of the
Cold War and Bill Clinton consolidate the triumph of democracy over
communism. President George W. Bush launched the bipartisan PEPFAR
initiative to help in the fight against HIV/AIDs, polio, malaria, and
other deadly diseases in Africa, the Caribbean, and elsewhere (a useful
precedent when thinking about what it will really take to combat the
coronavirus, not only in the developed nations, but in those with far
fewer economic and healthcare resources). It was on 9/11, however, as
U.S. ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, that I
learned one of the most powerful lessons about diplomacy. Just a few
hours after Al Qaida terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and
Pentagon, my phone started to ring at NATO headquarters outside
Brussels. My Canadian colleague, David Wright, called first---followed
by the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, France, Poland, Germany,
Italy, and many others. Each asked, "What can we do to help?" Those were
very welcome words on the single darkest day in recent American history.
By the next morning, invoking Article 5 of the 1949 NATO Treaty for the
first time in history, all of the NATO-allied countries came to the
rescue of the United States---lending mighty political and diplomatic
support to the military response that would come later. Our allies
considered Osama Bin Laden's attacks on New York and Washington as an
attack on them as well. Their militaries all went into Afghanistan with
us (the majority remain 19 years later---and they and other partner
nations have suffered more than 1,000 combat deaths; we owe them a lot).
Contrary to such evidence, the current president believes the United
States is strongest when it acts alone---unburdened of allies and
partners whom he views as relics of our Cold War past. I lived the
history of 9/11 and draw a very different lesson about the value of
allies to the United States. Why would we want to live alone in a
troubled and dangerous world, without the benefit of friends and allies
by our side? [Our NATO allies]{.underline}, as well as Japan, South
Korea, and Australia, [act as multipliers of American power in the
world]{.underline}. They provide a lifeline of military, economic, and
political support when we often need it most. They represent the great
power differential between the United States and our rivals Russia and
China, who can count on no such allies when the chips are down. As we
recover from two decades of war and COVID-19's assault on our society
and economy, we will need to look at our global role in a new way. The
era when America could run the world by fiat has vanished. We are still
the strongest economic, military, and technological power---but China,
India, and others are gaining on us. We can no longer overpower our
adversaries in every crisis. [And although we will need to call on the
military to defend us in the future, [we will more often than not need
to outwit and outmaneuver adversaries through]{.mark}]{.underline} the
strength of our **[[diplomats]{.underline}]{.mark}** and our
alliances---not to mention mustering support for those broader,
nonmilitary crises we now face, [**[from pandemics to climate
change]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

#### A cohesive framework that recognizes the agricultural and environmental benefits of biotech is key to overcome status quo regulations

**Zilberman and Wessler 22** (David Zilberman and Justus Wessler, David
Zilberman is an agricultrual economist and Robinson Chair at the
University of California Berkeley, Justus Wessler is a professor and
head of Agricultural Economics at Wageningen University, "The Role of
Policy in Supporting a Globally Diverse Bio-economy That Mitigates

WC-NAS)

[Perhaps the most significant cost of the extensive regulation of
agricultural biotechnology is that it has prevented researchers from
taking advantage of new biotechnology tools. As a result, the
development of auspicious traits of crops and livestock hasn't
materialized.]{.underline} For example, [researchers have identified
mechanisms to improve the shelf life of crops and enhance animal feed's
digestibility to reduce methane emissions, but they have not yet been
adopted.]{.underline} In addition, [scientists have identified means for
nitrogen fixation and accelerating photosynthesis, further increasing
yields and reducing costs and GHG emissions. Unfortunately, there has
been underinvestment in developing faster-growing trees or other
organisms that sequester carbon because of the low likelihood of
application due to regulation. Other examples include developing
biopolymers to substitute fossil fuel--based solutions]{.underline} and
using genetically modified microorganisms for producing enzymes that
more efficiently convert a wide range of biological resources to food,
feed, and bio-based materials.8

[One avenue to increase the contribution of agriculture to address the
challenges ahead is to **streamline and harmonize biotechnology
regulation to allow researchers and innovators to take advantage of its
potential increasing scale and scope of solutions**. Studies have shown
that harmonization of approval processes can substantially reduce
approval costs for new technologies and increase the incentives for
investment in biological control agents]{.underline}.9 The National
Academy of Sciences has shown that modern biotechnologies are not posing
additional environmental health risks compared to traditional
agricultural foods.10 On the contrary, [they can increase crop yields;
reduce land, inorganic fertilizer, and pesticide use; and reduce GHG
emissions]{.underline}. With enabling regulation, we expect that both
the public and private sectors will expand investment in developing
these technologies and, most importantly, using them.

#### Global warming causes extinction

**Krosofsky 21** (Andrew Krosofsky, "How Global Warming May Eventually
Lead to Global Extinction", Green Matters, March 11^th^ 2021,
https://www.greenmatters.com/p/will-global-warming-cause-extinction ,
WC-NAS)

Life on this planet has gone through many extinction-level events over
time. Most of these phenomena were caused by natural, cataclysmic forces
beyond the control of any of the lifeforms existing at that time. The
current cataclysmic forces anything but natural and they are well within
our control. [The question is not, \"[will global warming cause
extinction](https://www.greenmatters.com/p/endangered-vs-extinct-species)?\"---
it's, \"how can we prevent that inevitability from
happening?\"]{.underline}

[Will global warming cause extinction?]{.underline}

[Eventually, yes. Global warming will invariably result in the mass
extinction of millions of different species, humankind
included]{.underline}. In fact, [the Center for Biological
Diversity](https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/climate_law_institute/global_warming_and_life_on_earth/index.html) says
that [global warming is currently the greatest threat to life on this
planet]{.underline}. Global warming causes a number of detrimental
effects on the environment that many species won't be able to handle
long-term. 

[Extreme weather patterns are shifting climates across the globe,
eliminating habitats and altering the landscape. As a result, food and
fresh water sources are being drastically reduced. Then, of course,
there are the rising global temperatures themselves, which many species
are physically unable to contend with.]{.underline} Formerly
frozen [arctic and antarctic regions are
melting](https://www.greenmatters.com/p/arctic-ice-melting),
increasing [sea
levels](https://www.greenmatters.com/news/2019/01/15/bPhgWvMpZ/oceans-warming-climate-change) and
temperatures. Eventually, these effects will create a perfect storm of
extinction conditions. 

What species will go extinct if global warming continues?

[The melting glaciers of the arctic and the searing, unmanageable heat
indexes being seen along the Equator are just the tip of the iceberg, so
to speak]{.underline}. The species that live in these [climate
zones](https://www.greenmatters.com/p/what-is-a-climate-zone) have
already been affected by the changes caused by global warming. Take
polar bears for example, whose habitats and food sources have been so
greatly diminished that they have been forced to range further and
further south. 

[Increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and oceans have
already led to [ocean
acidification](https://www.greenmatters.com/p/what-causes-ocean-acidification#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Natural%20History,for%20some%20species%20to%20survive.).
This has caused many species of crustaceans to either adapt or perish
and has led to the mass bleaching of more than 50 percent of
Australia's [Great Barrier
Reef](https://www.greenmatters.com/p/coral-great-barrier-reef)]{.underline},

### I/L-- Carbon neutrality and sustainability

#### Biotechnology is critical to long-term carbon neutrality *[and]{.underline}* short-term sustainability measures

**USDA 22** (U.S Department of Agriculture, "Biotechnology and Climate
Change", February 22^nd^ 2022,
<https://www.usda.gov/topics/biotechnology/climate-change>, WC-NAS

[Agricultural biotechnology can be an important tool for addressing the
causes and consequences of [climate
change](https://www.usda.gov/oce/energy-and-environment/climate) and for
achieving important societal goals such as reduced poverty, improved
global food security, and reduced environmental impacts from
agriculture.]{.underline} That's why agricultural biotechnology is part
of USDA's toolkit for a healthy planet and sustainable future.

Causes and impacts of climate change

Human influence on the climate through emission of greenhouse gases is
clear. In the U.S., agriculture and forestry contributed an estimated
10.5% of greenhouse gas emissions in 2018
([USDA-ERS](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/natural-resources-environment/climate-change/)).
Impacts of climate change on agriculture include increased temperatures
and increased incidence or severity of extreme weather events.

\<CHART OMITTED\>

[Mitigating and adapting to climate change]{.underline}

[Agricultural biotechnology provides ways to both mitigate and enhance
adaptation to environmental changes. Products developed with
agricultural biotechnology may contribute to the reduction of greenhouse
gas emissions, such as [cover
crops](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/ny/technical/?cid=nrcs144p2_027252) that
provide [sustainable
biofuels](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pbi.13014), fruits
and vegetables that [stay fresh
longer](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41438-020-00428-4) and
reduce [food waste](https://www.usda.gov/foodlossandwaste). Researchers
are also developing ways to draw excess carbon dioxide out of the
atmosphere
with [trees](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11627-018-9914-1) and
even [microbes](https://elifesciences.org/articles/59882).]{.underline}

[Using agricultural biotechnology, plant and animal breeders can more
quickly develop plants and animals that are adapted to changing
environmental conditions, such as drought, increased temperatures, new
diseases, and other stressors.]{.underline}

For example, plant breeders are using agricultural biotechnology to
develop [drought-tolerant
crops](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11816-020-00598-6) including
wheat, rice, tomato, soybean, and cotton. [[Drought-tolerant
corn](https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2019/march/drought-tolerant-corn-in-the-united-states-research-commercialization-and-related-crop-production-practices/),
including certain varieties developed with genetic engineering, is
already being grown across drought-prone areas in the United
States. [Drought-tolerant
wheat](https://www.isaaa.org/kc/cropbiotechupdate/article/default.asp?ID=19114) is
approved for use in Argentina and Brazil.]{.underline}

[Animal breeders are using agricultural biotechnology, including genome
editing, to develop [heat-tolerant
cattle](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.05.010) that are
better able to regulate body temperature during hot
conditions]{.underline}. These cattle have reduced [heat
stress](https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2014/november/greater-heat-stress-from-climate-change-could-lower-dairy-productivity/),
due to shorter hair and metabolic changes.

[Creating a more sustainable world]{.underline}

[In addition to helping to mitigate and adapt to climate change,
application of agricultural biotechnology can help advance
the [sustainability](https://www.usda.gov/oce/sustainability) of food
systems]{.underline}. The United States is a leader in agricultural
research and development to improve productivity and promote
climate-smart use of natural resources in agriculture.

Through evidence-based innovation and science[, including agricultural
biotechnology, we can expand the toolbox for farmers, fishers, and other
producers to produce more with less -- less land, less water, fewer
inputs and resources. Innovative and creative solutions are necessary
for food systems to keep pace with evolving needs and challenges.
Increasing agricultural productivity can reduce agriculture's
environmental impacts, and also alleviate poverty, improve food security
and nutrition, and raise standards of living.]{.underline}

### I/L-- Sustainable Ag

#### Biocrops create a more sustainable agriculture industry-- that creates climate change resilience 

**Dionglay 22** (Clement Dionglay, "5 Ways Biotechnology Crops Slow Down
Climate Change", International Service For The Acquisition of
Agri-Biotech Applications", February 9^th^ 2022,
<https://www.isaaa.org/blog/entry/default.asp?BlogDate=2/9/2022>,
WC-NAS)

[Biotech crops slow down the effects of climate change]{.underline}

[Biotechnology offers a solution to reduce greenhouse gases and slow
down climate change. Biotech crops for the last 25 years of
commercialization have contributed to reducing CO2 emissions and allowed
farmers to use environment-friendly energy]{.underline}, less fertilizer
and chemical pesticides, and practice soil carbon sequestration. Here
are five solutions that biotechnology offers to slow down climate
change.

1\. [Herbicide tolerant biotech crops]{.underline}

Herbicide tolerant (HT) biotech crops are vital to farmers\' fight
against weeds. [HT crops tolerate exposure to broad-spectrum herbicides
such as glyphosate and glufosinate. These crops are compatible with
no-till methods, which help preserve the topsoil. ]{.underline}

[HT biotech crops facilitate zero or no-till farming, which
significantly reduces the loss of carbon from the soil]{.underline}
(carbon sequestration), CO2 emissions, and fuel use, and prevents soil
erosion. [A
study](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/21/11679/htm) conducted at the
University of Saskatchewan, Canada in 2021 reports that HT biotech crops
increase soil carbon sequestration, [keeping CO2 in the ground instead
of releasing it into the atmosphere. HT biotech crops help farmers and
the environment as they require less labor and fewer resources for
fossil fuel for tractors that plow the soil]{.underline}. Since their
introduction, herbicide tolerance technology has helped millions of
farmers who plant HT biotech crops. In 2019, [ISAAA
reported](https://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/55/default.asp) that
herbicide tolerance trait was the second most dominant trait deployed in
soybeans, maize, canola, cotton, sugar beets, and alfalfa, occupying
81.5 million hectares.

[2. Insect resistant biotech crops]{.underline}

Insect pests cause significant damage to crops, reducing yields and
prompting farmers to continually spray their plants with pesticides.
Excessive use of these pesticides is harmful to humans and the
environment so scientists developed [insect resistant (IR) biotech crops
using a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. Insect
resistant biotech crops, first introduced in maize (corn) and cotton in
the mid-1990s, require fewer pesticide sprays, which results in savings
of tractor/fossil fuel and thus less CO2 is released into the
atmosphere.]{.underline}

According to the 2018 [PG Economics
study](https://pgeconomics.co.uk/press+releases/25/Crop+biotechnology+continues+to+provide+higher+farmer+income+and+significant+environmental+benefits) by
Graham Brookes and Peter Barfoot, planting IR biotech crops has helped
save 776 million kg. a.i. of pesticides in 1996-2018 and by 51.7 million
kg in 2018 alone from being released into the environment. In 2019,
ISAAA reported that IR biotech crops were[ planted in 23.6 million
hectares](https://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/55/default.asp) in
India, Brazil, China, Pakistan, USA, Myanmar, South Africa, Sudan,
Malawi, Nigeria, Spain, Portugal, Bangladesh, Eswatini, and Ethiopia.
Brookes and Barfoot report that globally in 2018, the farm-level impact
of using IR biotech cotton was US\$4.38 billion and US\$3.37 billion for
IR biotech maize.

[3. Salinity tolerant crops]{.underline}

Biotech salt tolerant crops have been developed in countries such as the
USA, China, and Australia, and some are currently undergoing field
trials. In Australia, field trials of 1,161 lines of genetically
modified (GM) wheat and 1,179 lines of GM barley modified to contain one
of 35 genes obtained from wheat, barley, maize, thale cress, moss, or
yeasts were conducted in 2010-2015. Some of the genes are expected to
enhance tolerance to drought, cold, salinity, and low phosphorous.
Sugarcane that contains a transcription factor (OsDREB1A) also completed
field trial in 2015.

Genes influencing salt tolerance have been found in various plants. In
2019, scientists at the University of Western Australia [discovered two
enzymes](https://www.isaaa.org/kc/cropbiotechupdate/article/default.asp?ID=17358) that
explain wheat\'s sensitivity to salty soils. In 2020, scientists from
China National Rice Research Institute [identified a gene in
rice](https://www.isaaa.org/kc/cropbiotechupdate/article/default.asp?ID=17910) that
influences sugar metabolism as well as the plant\'s response to salinity
stress. Similarly, [a team from the US and South
Korea](https://www.isaaa.org/kc/cropbiotechupdate/article/default.asp?ID=18206) has
engineered thale cress to behave like a succulent with improved
water-use efficiency, and salinity tolerance by overexpressing a gene
involved in berry development in wine grapes.

[4. Drought resistant crops]{.underline}

[Agriculture is the largest consumer of water in the world, and in many
developing countries, the use of water for agriculture can exceed 90% of
consumption. The scarcity of water presents a major disaster worldwide,
and droughts have caused significant yield losses in recent years.
Drought tolerant biotech crops carrying genes for water-stress
management have been developed by scientists as a solution to yield
losses due to drought.]{.underline}

In 2019, soybean varieties carrying the [drought-tolerant HB4®
trait](https://www.isaaa.org/kc/cropbiotechupdate/article/default.asp?ID=16716) were
introduced in Argentina. HB4® soybeans deliver two layers of value for
farmers as they are both drought and herbicide tolerant. The [HB4®
technology](https://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/event/default.asp?EventID=403) reduces
yield loss when the crop is challenged
by [drought](https://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/pocketk/32/default.asp).
The [US
approval](https://www.isaaa.org/kc/cropbiotechupdate/article/default.asp?ID=17693) for
HB4® soybeans followed in the same year, with the [approval in
Canada](https://www.isaaa.org/kc/cropbiotechupdate/article/default.asp?ID=18816) granted
in 2021.

In 2020, Argentina became the first country in the world to
approve [HB4® drought tolerant
wheat](https://www.isaaa.org/kc/cropbiotechupdate/article/default.asp?ID=18384) for
growth and consumption. The HB4 trait increases wheat yields by up to
20% and is currently the only drought tolerance technology for wheat and
soybean crops in the world. In November 2021, Brazil approved [HB4®
wheat
flour](https://www.isaaa.org/kc/cropbiotechupdate/article/default.asp?ID=19114) for
animal and human consumption.

[5. Cold tolerant crops]{.underline}

[Using genetic and molecular approaches, several genes for cold
tolerance have been identified
in [rice](https://www.isaaa.org/kc/cropbiotechupdate/article/default.asp?ID=16076), [sugarcane](https://www.isaaa.org/kc/cropbiotechupdate/article/default.asp?ID=12055), [sorghum](https://www.isaaa.org/kc/cropbiotechupdate/article/default.asp?ID=10273),
and [potatoes](https://www.isaaa.org/kc/cropbiotechupdate/article/default.asp?ID=878)]{.underline}.
Cold tolerant GM crops are being developed such as GM eucalypti, which
is currently being field-tested in the US by Arborgen LLC since 2010.
Thale cress has been improved to contain the DaIRIP4 from Deschapsia
antarctica, a hairgrass that thrives in frosts down to -30C, and
sugarcane is being introgressed with genes from cold tolerant wild
varieties.

#### Biotech can create more sustainable, efficient, and productive agriculture 

**Chatterjee 21** (Jayanta Chatterjee, "Developing More Sustainable
Global Food Systems Through Agroecology and Biotechnology", US

WC-NAS

Agroecological systems are meant to be highly diverse and biotechnology
can help keep them diverse.  All breeding techniques depend
on diversity, embracing the range of traits found in plants and
beyond to develop robust, tasty crops needed to feed our
families.  Sometimes these traits already exist in the same
or related species and need just a little selective breeding to have the
new trait(s) incorporated in that crop, as has been done for [10,000 to
12,000
years](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/development-agriculture/),
since we invented agriculture.  In other cases, traits need to be shared
between two unrelated (sexually incompatible) species, which is
accomplished by genetic modification, both naturally or through
engineering.  In fact, all plant species naturally have [gained new
traits by picking up bacterial
genes](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/science/plant-genes-evolution.html) to survive and
thrive on dry land.  [Modern biotechnology is helping
diversify our diets and adapt to changing conditions.  Purple tomatoes

a few examples worth noting. ]{.underline}

Agroecology depends on context-specific knowledge.  Co-creation and
sharing of knowledge have been essential to our understanding of the
biology of living organisms and their interactions at the molecular
level.  [Research in molecular biology and its application in the form
of biotechnology can help to scientifically validate and improve upon
immensely powerful traditional and indigenous knowledge while protecting
vulnerable ecosystems and promoting biodiversity.]{.underline} 
Unfortunately, ideological arguments and unfounded fears often
jeopardize scientists' ability to verify the efficacy,
ensure the safety, and demonstrate the benefits of biotechnology.

[Improving efficiency is a vital element of agroecology and can
be directly strengthened by biotechnology. This could include developing
a crop variety that can grow with less water or
require s]{.underline}ignificantly less or no chemical pesticide or
fertilizer or vegetables or fruits with longer shelf life.  It can also
include commonly consumed crops supplemented with needed
micro/macro-nutrients
like [iron](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.571402/full#T1), [zinc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5790416/#cit0047), vitamins
(e.g., [vit
A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5790416/#cit0046),
as achieved by Golden Rice) and many other such nutrients
via [biofortification](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19020-4) through
genetic engineering.  [All of these
innovations increase the efficiency of our agricultural
systems.]{.underline}  A recently published [farm level survey in
Vietnam ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32997586/)showed that the
average amount of herbicide active ingredient applied to the biotech
crop area was 26 percent lower and 36 percent lower in terms of
environmental impact of the herbicide use as compared to control fields
planted with non-biotech crops.

[Agroecology places a strong emphasis on human and social values.
 Increases in agricultural productivity with the use of
biotechnology have resulted in better farmer livelihoods]{.underline}.
 In Vietnam, the farmers earned an additional income of \$6.84 to
\$12.55 for every extra \$1 spent on biotech seed relative to
conventional seed.

In agroecology, recycling means agricultural production with lower
economic and environmental costs.  Biodegradable
plastic (bio-plastic) is enabled using
biotechnology in [bacteria](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30091095/) and
increasingly
in [plants](https://www.cell.com/trends/plant-science/fulltext/S1360-1385(99)01544-7).  There
are many other ways biotechnology can help in recycling not just farm
byproducts but also polluted water and [soil via remediation to remove
various types of
contamination](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28386947/), including
heavy metal and petrochemical pollution.

People, communities, and nations show more resilience when their food
systems satisfy all the three pillars of sustainability -- economic,
social, and environmental. Overemphasis on one or two of these pillars
can lead to gaps in achieving food security, community development, or
biodiversity objectives, especially in many developing countries and
farming communities.  Standard organic and regenerative farming
practices, which are often equated with agroecological principles, aim
to meet resilience and sustainability goals, but there are differences
in productivity.

Gaps in productivity have been noted
in [Europe](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/food-farming-fisheries/farming/documents/market-brief-organic-farming-in-the-eu_mar2019_en.pdf), particularly
important for wheat, with a "yield gaps ranging between
40 percent (Germany) and 85 percent (Italy) of conventional
yields."  Yield loss has also occurred in [tropical countries like Sri
Lanka](https://www.sundaytimes.lk/210523/news/agriculture-economists-praise-switch-to-organic-farming-but-concerned-over-blanket-ban-on-chemical-fertiliser-444766.html), which
has [banned import of fertilizers and

to shift to organic farming.  In the United States, [costs for organic
corn](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=101938) are
estimated to be \$83--\$98 higher per acre than their conventional
counterparts and costs for organic soybeans are estimated at
\$106--\$125 higher.  Buyers must pay a higher price for
such organic products.  Farmers producing organic crops need
to charge proportionately more to compensate for the yield loss.  Most
farmers and other consumers in the world do not have the luxury to buy
more expensive food.  Together, agroecology and biotechnology can
overcome the gap.

#### A need for massive expansion of ag is coming \-\-- by 2050 we will run out of food if we don't find new strategies for sustainable farming

Can We Meet It?," pg online @
<https://hbr.org/2016/04/global-demand-for-food-is-rising-can-we-meet-it>
//um-ef)

Over the last century, [the global population has
quadrupled]{.underline}. In 1915, there were 1.8 billion people in the
world. Today, according to the most recent estimate by the UN, there are
7.3 billion people --- and [we may reach 9.7 billion by
2050]{.underline}. [This growth]{.underline}, along with rising incomes
in developing countries (which cause dietary changes such as eating more
protein and meat) are [driving up [global food
demand]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Food demand [is expected to
increase]{.mark}]{.underline} anywhere between [59% to [98% by
2050]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This will shape [ag]{.mark}ricultural
[markets]{.mark}]{.underline} in ways we have not seen before. [Farmers
worldwide [will need to increase crop production]{.mark}]{.underline},
either by increasing the amount of agricultural land to grow crops or by
[enhancing productivity]{.underline} on existing agricultural lands
through fertilizer and irrigation and adopting new methods like
precision farming. However, [[the ecological and social
trade-offs]{.underline}]{.mark} of clearing more land for agriculture
[[are]{.mark} often [high]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly in the
tropics. And right now, crop [yields]{.underline} --- the amount of
crops harvested per unit of land cultivated --- [are growing **too
slowly** to meet the forecasted demand for food]{.underline}. Many other
factors, from climate change to urbanization to a lack of investment,
will also make it challenging to produce enough food. There is strong
academic consensus that climate change--driven water scarcity, rising
global temperatures, and extreme weather will have severe long-term
effects on crop yields. These are expected to impact many major
agricultural regions, especially those close to the Equator. For
example, the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, one of the most important
agricultural regions worldwide, may face an 18% to 23% reduction in soy
and corn output by 2050, due to climate change. The Midwestern U.S. and
Eastern Australia --- two other globally important regions --- may also
see a substantial decline in agricultural output due to extreme heat.
Yet some places are expected to (initially) benefit from climate change.
Countries stretching over northern latitudes --- mainly China, Canada,
and Russia --- are forecasted to experience longer and warmer growing
seasons in certain areas. Russia, which is already a major grain
exporter, has huge untapped production potential because of large crop
yield gaps (the difference between current and potential yields under
current conditions) and widespread abandoned farmland (more than 40
million hectares, an area larger than Germany) following the dissolution
of the Soviet Union, in 1991. The country arguably has the most
agricultural opportunity in the world, but institutional reform and
significant investments in agriculture and rural infrastructure will be
needed to realize it. Advanced logistics, transportation, storage, and
processing are also crucial for making sure that food goes from where it
grows in abundance to where it doesn't. This is where soft commodity
trading companies, such as Cargill, Louis Dreyfus, or COFCO, come in.
While Big Food companies such as General Mills or Unilever have
tremendous global influence on what people eat, trading companies have a
much greater impact on food security, because they source and distribute
our staple foods and the ingredients used by Big Food, from rice, wheat,
corn, and sugar to soybean and oil palm. They also store periodically
produced grains and oilseeds so that they can be consumed all year, and
they process soft commodities so that they can be used further down the
value chain. For example, wheat needs to be milled into flour to produce
bread or noodles, and soybeans must be crushed to produce oil or feed
for livestock. Nonetheless, [even if some regions increase their output
and traders reduce the mismatch between supply and demand, doubling food
production by 2050 will undeniably be a major challenge]{.underline}.
Businesses and governments will have to work together to increase
productivity, encourage innovation, and improve integration in supply
chains toward a sustainable global food balance. First and foremost,
farmers, trading companies, and other processing groups (Big Food in
particular) need to commit to deforestation-free supply chains.
Deforestation causes rapid and irreversible losses of biodiversity, is
the second largest source of carbon dioxide emissions after fossil
fuels, and has contributed greatly to global warming---adding to the
negative pressure on agriculture production for which these forests were
cleared in the first place. [[Farmers must]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[grow more on the land they currently operate through what is called
"sustainable intensification."]{.underline} [This means **[using
precision farming tools]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as GPS fertilizer
dispersion, advanced irrigation systems, and environmentally optimized
crop rotations. [These methods can help produce more crops]{.underline},
especially in parts of Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe with
large yield gaps. [They can also [reduce]{.mark} the [negative
environmental impacts]{.mark} from over-stressing resources--[preventing
groundwater depletion]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} the
[destruction of fertile lands through **over-use**]{.mark} **of
fertilizer**]{.underline}. The agricultural sector also needs
significant long-term private investment and public spending. Many large
institutional investors, including pension funds and sovereign wealth
funds, have already made major commitments to support global
agricultural production and trading in recent years---not least because
agricultural (land) investments have historically delivered strong
returns, increased diversification, and outpaced inflation. Still,
investment in agriculture in most developing countries has declined over
the last 30 years and much less is spent on R&D compared to developed
countries---resulting in low productivity and stagnant production. And
because banking sectors in developing countries give fewer loans to
farmers (compared to the share of agriculture in GDP), investments by
both farmers and large corporations are still limited. To attract more
financing and investment in agriculture, the risks need to be reduced by
governments. [Regulators need to overhaul policies that limit inclusion
of small, rural farmers]{.underline} into the financial system--- for
example, soft loans (i.e., lending that is more generous than market
lending) and interest rate caps discourage bank lending. More supportive
policies, laws, and public spending on infrastructure would help create
a favorable investment climate for agriculture.

[The **U**nited **S**tates faces many threats to our National Security.
These threats include continuing wars with extremist elements such as
ISIS and potential **wars with rogue state North Korea** or regional
**nuclear power Iran**.]{.underline} The heated [economic and diplomatic
competition with Russia and a surging China could **spiral out of
control**. Concurrently, [we face threats to]{.mark} our [future
security posed by]{.mark} growing [civil strife, **famine**]{.mark}, and
refugee and migration challenges which [create]{.mark} incubators for
[extremist]{.mark} and anti-American government
[factions]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Our response cannot be one
dimensional]{.underline} [but instead must be]{.underline} a [nuanced
and comprehensive]{.underline} National Security Strategy combining all
elements of National Power [including a **Food Security
Strategy**]{.underline}.¶ An American [[Food
Security]{.underline}]{.mark} Strategy [[is]{.mark} an
**[imperative]{.mark} factor**]{.underline} [[in reducing]{.mark} the
multiple [threats]{.mark} impacting our]{.underline} National
[wellbeing]{.underline}. [Recent history has shown that reliable food
supplies and stable prices [produce]{.mark} more [stable]{.mark} and
secure [countries]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Conversely, food
insecurity]{.underline}, particularly in poorer countries, [can lead to
**instability**, unrest, and **violence**]{.underline}.¶ [Food
[insecurity drives **mass migration**]{.mark} around the world from the
Middle East, to Africa, to Southeast Asia, destabilizing neighboring
populations, [generating **conflicts**]{.mark}, and threatening our own
security]{.underline} [by [disrupting]{.mark} our [economic, military,
and diplomatic **relations**]{.mark}hips]{.underline}. [Food system
shocks]{.underline} from extreme food-price volatility [can be
correlated with protests and riots]{.underline}. [Food price related
protests toppled governments in Haiti and Madagascar in 2007 and
2008.]{.underline} In 2010 and in 2011, [food prices and grievances
related to food policy were one of the major drivers of the Arab Spring
uprisings.]{.underline} [Repeatedly, history has taught us that a
**[strong ag]{.mark}ricultural sector**]{.underline} [[is an]{.mark}
unquestionable [**requirement** for]{.mark} inclusive and [sustainable
growth]{.mark}]{.underline}, broad-based development progress, [[and
long-term stability]{.mark}.]{.underline}¶ The impact can be remarkable
and far reaching. [Rising income, in addition to reducing the
opportunities for an upsurge in extremism, leads to changes in diet,
producing demand for more diverse and nutritious foods
provided]{.underline}, in many cases, [from American farmers and
ranchers.]{.underline} [Emerging markets]{.underline} currently
[purchase 20 percent of U.S. **ag**riculture exports and that figure is
expected to grow as populations boom.]{.underline}¶ Moving early to
ensure stability in strategically significant regions requires long term
planning and a disciplined, thoughtful strategy. To combat current
threats and work to prevent future ones, our national leadership must
employ the entire spectrum of our power including diplomatic, economic,
and cultural elements. The best means to prevent future chaos and the
resulting instability is positive engagement addressing the causes of
instability before it occurs.¶ This is not rocket science. We know where
the instability is most likely to occur. [The world population will grow
by 2.5 billion people by 2050. Unfortunately, this massive [population
boom is projected to occur primarily in]{.mark} the most fragile and
[food insecure countries]{.mark}]{.underline}. This alarming math is not
just about total numbers. [Projections show that the greatest increase
is in the age groups most vulnerable to extremism]{.underline}. There
are currently 200 million people in Africa between the ages of 15 and
24, with that number expected to double in the next 30 years. Already,
60% of the unemployed in Africa are young people. ¶ [Too often these
situations deteriorate into **shooting wars** requiring the deployment
of]{.underline} our [military forces]{.underline}. We should be
continually mindful that the price we pay for committing military forces
is measured in our most precious national resource, the blood of those
who serve. For those who live in rural America, this has a
disproportionate impact. Fully 40% of those who serve in our military
come from the farms, ranches, and non-urban communities that make up
only 16% of our population. ¶ Actions taken now to increase agricultural
sector jobs can provide economic opportunity and stability for those
unemployed youths while helping to feed people. A recent report by the
Chicago Council on Global Affairs identifies agriculture development as
the core essential for providing greater food security, economic growth,
and population well-being.¶ Our active support for food security,
including agriculture development, has helped stabilize key regions over
the past 60 years[. [A robust food security

strategy[, can]{.mark} mitigate the growth of terrorism, build important
relationships, and support continued American economic and
**ag**ricultural prosperity while]{.underline} materially [[contributing

### I/L-- Marine

#### Increasing biotech innovation is key to marine ecosystem conservation and climate resilience

**R&R 19** (Revive&Restore, Conservation project that focuses on the
genetic rescue of species by partnering with workshops and global
experts, "A Call For Biotechnology in Ocean Conservation", December
5^th^ 2019,
<https://reviverestore.org/a-call-for-biotechnology-in-ocean-conservation/>,
WC-NAS)

This report is the culmination of nine months of research with over 100
experts in ocean ecology, genomics, and biotechnology. [It describes how
genomic and biotech innovations---including genomic sequencing,
biobanking, advanced reproductive technologies, and genetic
engineering---can address some of the ocean's biggest threats---from
coral bleaching and overfishing to invasives and island
biodiversity---all-the-while complementing traditional conservation and
remediation strategies.]{.underline}

To a roomful of scientists, conservationists, and thinkers, Phelan
stated that these "[genomic technologies in synthetic biology,
by-in-large are highly underutilized by the conservation community,
especially when it comes to the ocean."]{.underline}

Traditional conservation efforts rely heavily on being protected, like
California's Monterey Bay. [However, biotechnology must be used to
enhance conservation]{.underline}, too, said Phelan.

"It's really about the culmination of all of these technologies. It's
all the tools that conservation has to offer. We have to protect,
absolutely," she said, then added, "We have to intervene."

The Ocean Genomics Horizon Scan helped Revive & Restore develop a list
of Ten Big Ideas, each one a major opportunity for biotechnology to
protect and promote a healthier marine environment. These include:

[GENOMICS GUIDING MPA'S]{.underline}

Using genomics, eDNA, and [next-generation genetic sequencing to
evaluate the biodiversity of an area, said Phelan, can help strengthen
the rationale for preserving established MPAs]{.underline} and assess
optimal locations for new MPAs.

[ADVANCED CORAL TOOLKIT]{.underline}

Today, reefs around the world are threatened by rising temperatures and
invasive species. There are more than 650 different types of coral, but
less than a dozen coral genomes have been sequenced.  "We're losing
biodiversity before we bank it and before we sequence it," said Phelan.

[Techniques for isolating coral stem cells, a robust library of coral
genomes and cryopreserved specimens]{.underline}, plus the ability to
induce coral spawning, will all help scientists revive coral reefs in
the future, she added.

[TARGETING INVASIVES]{.underline}

Additionally, [genomic interventions may help species gain a biological
advantage to fend off predators, disease, and other threats that are
winning out in many weakened ecosystems]{.underline}. These facilitated
adaptations could one day help corals fend off the crown of thorns
starfish---14 million of which are preying upon the Great Barrier Reef
and adding to its destabilization.

### Impact-- Climate

#### Warming leads to extinction

**Kareiva 18**, Ph.D. in ecology and applied mathematics from Cornell
University, director of the Institute of the Environment and
Sustainability at UCLA, Pritzker Distinguished Professor in Environment
& Sustainability at UCLA, et al. (Peter, "Existential risk due to
ecosystem collapse: Nature strikes back," Futures, 102)

In summary, six of the nine proposed planetary boundaries (phosphorous,
nitrogen, biodiversity, land use, atmospheric aerosol loading, and
chemical pollution) are unlikely to be associated with existential
risks. They all correspond to a degraded environment, but in our
assessment do not represent existential risks. However, the three
remaining boundaries ([[climate]{.mark} [change]{.mark}, global
freshwater cycle, [and]{.mark} ocean
[acidification]{.mark}]{.underline}) do [[pose **existential
risks**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This is]{.mark} [because of]{.mark}
intrinsic **[positive feedback loops]{.mark}**]{.underline}, substantial
lag times between system change and experiencing the consequences of
that change, [[and]{.mark} the fact these different boundaries interact
with one another in ways that yield **[surprises]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
In addition, [[climate]{.mark}, freshwater, [and]{.mark} ocean
[acidification are]{.mark} all [directly connected to]{.mark} the
provision of [**food** and **water**]{.mark}, and
[shortages]{.mark}]{.underline} of food and water can [[create
**conflict**]{.mark} and social unrest]{.underline}. Climate change has
a long history of disrupting civilizations and sometimes precipitating
the collapse of cultures or mass emigrations (McMichael, 2017). For
example, the 12th century drought in the North American Southwest is
held responsible for the collapse of the Anasazi pueblo culture. More
recently, the infamous potato famine of 1846--1849 and the large
migration of Irish to the U.S. can be traced to a combination of
factors, one of which was climate. Specifically, 1846 was an unusually
warm and moist year in Ireland, providing the climatic conditions
favorable to the fungus that caused the potato blight. As is so often
the case, poor government had a role as well---as the British government
forbade the import of grains from outside Britain (imports that could
have helped to redress the ravaged potato yields). [Climate change
intersects with freshwater resources because it is expected to
**exacerbate drought** and]{.underline} [**water
scarcity**,]{.underline} as well as flooding. Climate change can even
impair water quality because it is associated with heavy rains that
overwhelm sewage treatment facilities, or because it results in higher
concentrations of pollutants in groundwater as a result of enhanced
evaporation and reduced groundwater recharge. [Ample clean
water]{.underline} is not a luxury---it [is essential for human
survival.]{.underline} Consequently, cities, regions and nations that
lack clean freshwater are vulnerable to social disruption and disease.
Finally, ocean acidification is linked to climate change because it is
driven by CO2 emissions just as global warming is. With close to 20% of
the world's protein coming from oceans (FAO, 2016), the potential for
severe impacts due to acidification is obvious. Less obvious, but
perhaps more insidious, is the interaction between climate change and
the loss of oyster and coral reefs due to acidification. Acidification
is known to interfere with oyster reef building and coral reefs.
[[Climate change]{.mark} also [increases **storm**]{.mark}
**[frequency]{.mark}** and severity. Coral reefs and oyster reefs
provide protection from storm surge because they reduce wave
energy]{.underline} (Spalding et al., 2014). [If these reefs are lost
due to acidification at the same time as storms become more severe and
sea level rises]{.underline}, **[[coastal communities will be]{.mark}
[exposed to unprecedented storm surge]{.mark}]{.underline}**---[and may
be ravaged by recurrent storms]{.underline}. A key feature of the risk
associated with climate change is that mean annual temperature and mean
annual rainfall are not the variables of interest. Rather it is extreme
episodic events that place nations and entire regions of the world at
risk. These extreme events are by definition "rare" (once every hundred
years), and changes in their likelihood are challenging to detect
because of their rarity, but are exactly the manifestations of climate
change that we must get better at anticipating (Diffenbaugh et al.,
2017). [[Society will have a hard time responding to shorter intervals
between]{.mark} rare **[extreme events]{.mark}**]{.underline} because in
the lifespan of an individual human, a person might experience as few as
two or three extreme events. How likely is it that you would notice a
change in the interval between events that are separated by decades,
especially given that the interval is not regular but varies
stochastically? A concrete example of this dilemma can be found in the
past and expected future changes in storm-related flooding of New York
City. The highly disruptive flooding of New York City associated with
Hurricane Sandy represented a flood height that occurred once every 500
years in the 18th century, and that occurs now once [every 25 years, but
is expected to occur once every 5 years by 2050]{.underline} (Garner et
al., 2017). This change in frequency of extreme floods has profound
implications for the measures New York City should take to protect its
infrastructure and its population, yet because of the stochastic nature
of such events, this shift in flood frequency is an elevated risk that
will go unnoticed by most people. 4. The combination of positive
feedback loops and societal inertia is fertile ground for global
environmental catastrophes [Humans are remarkably ingenious, and have
**adapted** to crises throughout their history]{.underline}. Our doom
has been repeatedly predicted, only to be averted by innovation (Ridley,
2011). [However, the many [stories of]{.mark} human ingenuity
[successfully addressing existential risks]{.mark}]{.underline} such as
global famine or extreme air pollution [[represent]{.mark} environmental
[challenges that are largely linear, have immediate]{.mark}
[consequences, and operate without positive
feedbacks]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, the fact that food is in
short supply does not increase the rate at which humans consume
food---thereby increasing the shortage. Similarly, massive air pollution
episodes such as the London fog of 1952 that killed 12,000 people did
not make future air pollution events more likely. In fact it was just
the opposite---the London fog sent such a clear message that Britain
quickly enacted pollution control measures (Stradling, 2016). Food
shortages, air pollution, water pollution, etc. send immediate signals
to society of harm, which then trigger a negative feedback of society
seeking to reduce the harm. In contrast, today's great environmental
crisis of climate change may cause some harm but there are generally
long time delays between rising CO2 concentrations and damage to humans.
The consequence of these delays are an absence of urgency; thus although
70% of Americans believe global warming is happening, only 40% think it
will harm them
(http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2016/).
Secondly, [unlike past environmental challenges, **the Earth's
[climate]{.mark} system [is rife with positive feedback
loops]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In particular, as CO2 increases and the
climate warms, that very [warming can cause more CO2]{.mark}
[release]{.mark} which further increases global warming, and then more
CO2, and so on]{.underline}. Table 2 summarizes the best documented
positive feedback loops for the Earth's climate system. These feedbacks
can be neatly categorized into carbon cycle, biogeochemical,
biogeophysical, cloud, ice-albedo, and water vapor feedbacks. As
important as it is to understand these feedbacks individually, it is
even more essential to study the interactive nature of these feedbacks.
Modeling studies show that when interactions among feedback loops are
included, uncertainty increases dramatically and there is a heightened
potential for perturbations to be magnified (e.g., Cox, Betts, Jones,
Spall, & Totterdell, 2000; Hajima, Tachiiri, Ito, & Kawamiya, 2014;
Knutti & Rugenstein, 2015; Rosenfeld, Sherwood, Wood, & Donner, 2014).
This produces a wide range of future scenarios. Positive feedbacks in
the carbon cycle involves the enhancement of future carbon contributions
to the atmosphere due to some initial increase in atmospheric CO2. This
happens because as CO2 accumulates, it reduces the efficiency in which
oceans and terrestrial ecosystems sequester carbon, which in return
feeds back to exacerbate climate change (Friedlingstein et al., 2001).
Warming can also increase the rate at which organic matter decays and
carbon is released into the atmosphere, thereby causing more warming
(Melillo et al., 2017). Increases in food shortages and lack of water is
also of major concern when biogeophysical feedback mechanisms perpetuate
drought conditions. The underlying mechanism here is that losses in
vegetation increases the surface albedo, which suppresses rainfall, and
thus enhances future vegetation loss and more suppression of
rainfall---thereby initiating or prolonging a drought (Chamey, Stone, &
Quirk, 1975). To top it off, overgrazing depletes the soil, leading to
augmented vegetation loss (Anderies, Janssen, & Walker, 2002). Climate
change often also increases the risk of forest fires, as a result of
higher temperatures and persistent drought conditions. [The expectation
is that forest fires will become more frequent and severe with climate
warming and drought]{.underline} (Scholze, Knorr, Arnell, & Prentice,
2006), a trend for which we have already seen evidence (Allen et al.,
2010). Tragically, the increased severity and risk of Southern
California wildfires recently predicted by climate scientists (Jin et
al., 2015), was realized in December 2017, with the largest fire in the
history of California (the "Thomas fire" that burned 282,000 acres,
https://www.vox.com/2017/12/27/16822180/thomas-fire-california-largest-wildfire).
[This [catastrophic fire]{.mark} embodies the sorts of positive
feedbacks and interacting factors that [could **catch humanity
off-guard**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and produce a]{.mark} true
**[apocalyptic event]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Record-breaking rains
produced an extraordinary flush of new vegetation, that then dried out
as record heat waves and dry conditions took hold, coupled with stronger
than normal winds, and ignition. Of course the record-fire released CO2
into the atmosphere, thereby contributing to future warming. Out of all
types of feedbacks, water vapor and the ice-albedo feedbacks are the
most clearly understood mechanisms. Losses in reflective snow and ice
cover drive up surface temperatures, leading to even more melting of
snow and ice cover---this is known as the ice-albedo feedback (Curry,
Schramm, & Ebert, 1995). As snow and ice continue to melt at a more
rapid pace, millions of people may be displaced by flooding risks as a
consequence of sea level rise near coastal communities (Biermann & Boas,
2010; Myers, 2002; Nicholls et al., 2011). The water vapor feedback
operates when warmer atmospheric conditions strengthen the saturation
vapor pressure, which creates a warming effect given water vapor's
strong greenhouse gas properties (Manabe & Wetherald, 1967). Global
warming tends to increase cloud formation because warmer temperatures
lead to more evaporation of water into the atmosphere, and warmer
temperature also allows the atmosphere to hold more water. The key
question is whether this increase in clouds associated with global
warming will result in a positive feedback loop (more warming) or a
negative feedback loop (less warming). For decades, scientists have
sought to answer this question and understand the net role clouds play
in future climate projections (Schneider et al., 2017). Clouds are
complex because they both have a cooling (reflecting incoming solar
radiation) and warming (absorbing incoming solar radiation) effect
(Lashof, DeAngelo, Saleska, & Harte, 1997). The type of cloud, altitude,
and optical properties combine to determine how these countervailing
effects balance out. Although still under debate, it appears that in
most circumstances the cloud feedback is likely positive (Boucher et
al., 2013). For example, models and observations show that increasing
greenhouse gas concentrations reduces the low-level cloud fraction in
the Northeast Pacific at decadal time scales. This then has a positive
feedback effect and enhances climate warming since less solar radiation
is reflected by the atmosphere (Clement, Burgman, & Norris, 2009). [The
key lesson from the long list of potentially positive feedbacks and
their interactions is that]{.underline} [**[runaway climate
change]{.mark}**, and runaway perturbations have to be taken as a
serious possibility]{.underline}. Table 2 is just a snapshot of the type
of feedbacks that have been identified (see Supplementary material for a
more thorough explanation of positive feedback loops). However, [this
list is not exhaustive and the possibility of undiscovered positive
feedbacks [portends]{.mark} **even greater [existential
risk]{.mark}s**]{.underline}. The many environmental crises humankind
has previously averted (famine, ozone depletion, London fog, water
pollution, etc.) were averted because of political will based on solid
scientific understanding. We cannot count on complete scientific
understanding when it comes to positive feedback loops and climate
change.

Many forecasts during the past 30 years have anticipated amazing
advances in biotech---including cures for disease, eradication of
hunger, and the means to transition away from petrochemical
dependence---but the story of biotech has been one of incremental gains
in food and material production, and medical advances. During the next
20 years, however, [biotech is likely to transform a broader range of
human experiences]{.underline}. A more multidisciplinary, digital, and
data-rich approach to life sciences is accelerating the understanding of
and ability to predictably manipulate living matter, although market,
regulatory, and normative conditions will moderate the pace and focus of
progress. Biotechnology probably will improve many aspects of human
existence; however, the pursuit and possible application of these
technologies may also create social and economic disruptions and raise
numerous ethical questions. BIOSCIENCE POISED TO ACCELERATE Over
centuries, our use and manipulation of life processes in agriculture,
medicine, and manufacturing have progressed incrementally, punctuated by
leaps in understanding brought about by key discoveries, such as
Mendelian genetics, Germ Theory, and DNA. These leaps could not have
happened without the development and acceptance of novel tools and
algorithms for detecting, imaging, and manipulating biological systems.
During the next 20 years, a more multidisciplinary and data-intensive
approach to life sciences will shift our understanding of and ability to
manipulate living matter. Scientists are increasingly treating genetic
instructions as a form of computational code and incorporating insights
and new tools from the rapidly advancing realm of computational science.
These disciplines, combined with cognitive science, nanotechnology,
physics, and others, are [propelling new leaps in our understanding. It
is anticipated that the collective application of these diverse
technologies to the life sciences---known as bioconvergence---will
accelerate discovery and predictability in biotech design and
production.]{.underline} This multidisciplinary approach has made it
possible to: Visualize, measure, identify, and manipulate biological
systems at molecular scales Treat genetic instructions in DNA, RNA, and
amino acids like a language that can be written, edited, and executed
with high precision to synthesize useful materials or organisms Collect,
digitize, store, and analyze genetic instructions, referred to as
genomes, from many thousands of individuals, along with their physical,
mental, and health traits to correlate how specific genetic instructions
interact with the environment to produce distinct traits Combine complex
biological and nonbiological processes, such as bioelectronic interfaces
for sensing or stimulating biological systems in support of medicine,
agriculture, and manufacturing FACTORS SHAPING BIOTECH'S TRAJECTORY
Economic, social, and political factors are likely to influence the pace
and focus of biotech research and the availability of products.
Increased Investment and Decreasing Cost These economic factors together
will be pivotal to future biotech breakthroughs and applications. In
2019, the [global bioeconomy, defined as all activity enabled by
research and innovation in the life sciences and biotechnology,
accounted for about \$5 trillion, or nearly 6 percent of global
GDP]{.underline}. Based on 10-15 percent annual revenue growth trends,
**[the world bioeconomy could exceed \$20 trillion by
2030.]{.underline}** A drop in the cost of key enabling technologies
could spur application of biotech to a wider set of challenges and
potentially democratize aspects of biotech R&D and production,
increasing its global accessibility.

growth]{.underline}. The company, which reported \$10.6 billion in sales
last year and is among Europe's largest chemical producers, says the
platform will build on its already leading position in biobased products
that includes guar, solvents, and vanillin. Its other growth platforms
are battery materials, green hydrogen, and thermoplastic composites.
"[The sustainable use of renewable resources and biotechnology has
gained momentum in the industry and has the potential to help solve some
of the most pressing challenges faced by society today]{.underline},"
Solvay CEO Ilham Kadri says in a press statement. "Through our new
growth platform, we aim to connect with our partners to reinvent
progress, as we have done throughout our 160-year history, playing a key
role in the chemical industry's transition to the bioeconomy and helping
to create the sustainable and circular solutions required by society."
Solvay says it will pursue products with applications in agrochemicals,
personal care, food and flavors, and advanced materials for
transportation and aerospace. The company expects products made using
synthetic biology to account for a third of global manufacturing by the
end of 2030.

### add on \-- Democracy ! 

#### Diplomatic credibility is key to democracy

**Burns 20**, Goodman Family professor of the practice of diplomacy and
international relations, is chair of the Harvard Kennedy School's
Program on Transatlantic Relations, director of the Future of Diplomacy
Project, and a co-leader of the American Secretaries of State Project
(Nicholas, "The Indispensable Power," *Harvard Magazine*,

MY EXPERIENCE in government has also taught me that [[diplomacy
is]{.underline}]{.mark} most **[[effective]{.underline}]{.mark}** when
it is cemented in American values and the rule of law. [That should lead
us to stand up for]{.underline} democracy when it is threatened in
[NATO-allied countries]{.underline} such as Turkey and Hungary, and when
human rights are assaulted in Russia and China. When I interviewed
former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis a few months ago in Washington,
he pointed to this foundational American strength. The United States
exercises two great powers in the world, he said. The first is the
"power of intimidation," through our first-class military. But America
has a second and more important power---the "power of inspiration" to
the rest of the world, reflecting our nation's democratic founding. A
Harvard audience heard a variation of this theme from Winston Churchill
in Memorial Hall on September 6, 1943, when he received an honorary
doctorate of laws from President James B. Conant. In a lyrical speech
entitled, "The Gift of a Common Tongue," Churchill urged his audience of
deans, professors, and dignitaries---and in later remarks in nearby
Tercentenary Theatre, more than 6,000 cadets training to go to war---to
reject isolationism and accept the mantle of world leadership. At a time
when the United States had surpassed the British empire as the most
powerful global leader, Churchill's speech was a metaphorical handing of
a baton to the young Americans on the front lines of World War II. "The
price of greatness is responsibility," he said. "One cannot rise to be
in many ways the leading community in the civilized world without being
involved in its problems, without being convulsed by its agonies and
inspired by its causes." Churchill's words at Harvard then are as vital
and relevant to Americans today. [[Americans can author a

However, [reducing the United States' emphasis on a values-driven
foreign policy is wrong, and contrary to the strategic interests of the
United States]{.underline}. **[[Democracy

role in safeguarding U.S. interests]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[and
promoting global, long-term growth in ways fundamentally compatible with
U.S. strategic interests.]{.underline} After all, **[[democracies
protect private property]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in important ways[,
**invest in public goods**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [are more politically
stable, make for **[more dependable allies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and
empirically **[do not go to war with one another]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Ultimately, a world full of democratic governments is safer, more
prosperous, and more stable --- all states of being that the United
States has an interest in promoting.

[[Democracy guarantees]{.mark} that the public has a stake in its own
institutions and government, which leads to **[investor confidence
and]{.mark} growth**. Since elected politicians are accountable to
property owners and are held in check by an independent judiciary,
democracies tend to have better mechanisms for **protecting private
property**]{.underline} [than their autocratic counterparts. This makes
democracies a **particularly attractive type of country for investors**
--- both public and private --- because checks and balances make it
difficult for the state to nationalize industries]{.underline}. Further,
[private property rights protected by the legal system **[encourage
entrepreneurship and small business development]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[both of which are **key to a growing and modernizing
economy**]{.underline}. As a result, [democracies tend to be wealthier
and more economically stable than their autocratic
counterparts.]{.underline} This is fundamentally in the interest of the
United States in that both private and public investors have an interest
in seeing returns on their investments, [thereby potentially making
**countries less willing to go to war if that would require severing
economic ties**]{.underline}. Democratic institutions ensure that
citizens with both economic and political power are heard.

[Democracies also **[invest in public goods]{.mark} at much higher rates
than autocratic governments**]{.underline}. [Because politicians must
cater to the median voter, they **approve policies that invest in public
education and healthcare**]{.underline}, [both of which promote
long-term growth and development]{.underline}. Public education invests
in a country's human capital, setting the stage for long-term
innovation, adaptability, and advancement. [Public healthcare,
meanwhile, has been shown to **[increase overall societal
productivity]{.mark}** and well-being as people take fewer sick days,
citizens are able to afford their healthcare without going bankrupt, and
ultimately, [the overall **costs of healthcare are driven down**]{.mark}
as citizens become healthier]{.underline}. Productive, innovative
societies are also better for the United States --- [innovation around
the world improves global quality of life, results in more educational
and vocational opportunities for Americans]{.underline} (both because
other universities and jobs become more attractive to Americans who want
to go abroad and because potential immigrants are more likely to want to
stay in their own country, opening up opportunities for U.S. citizens at
home), [and may reduce friction between countries over resources and
labor]{.underline}.

[Democracies are also generally more politically stable because regular
election cycles ensure an established process for the habitual and
peaceful removal of leaders from power.]{.underline} [Elections ensure
the non-violent transition of power and reduce the need for mass
protest, rioting, and revolution --- which **[makes countries more
politically stable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Further, when citizens are
granted rights and protections from government abuse, enforced by an
independent judiciary, they have fewer grievances against the government
and are thus less able to mobilize large numbers of people to violently
overthrow the regime. [Revolution, while not always violent, often leads
to political instability, challenges to growth, **[increased incentives
for diversionary war and conflict]{.mark}**, and oftentimes civil
war]{.underline}. The externalities of civil war and international
conflict then put pressure on the United States to intervene, protect
human rights, and otherwise expend resources on other countries' issues.
[Further, civil wars are highly destructive to institutions, human
capital, and resources, and can have significant security spillover
effects, increasing global risk of political [instability and **violent
extremism**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[This political stability, in addition to institutional checks and
balances, makes **democracies better international partners and allies
in the long-term**]{.underline}. Treaties ratified by multiple branches
of government are more durable than executive agreements signed by a
single leader who may be replaced within a short period of time. [While
democracies may be more reluctant to commit to alliances and formal
security pacts, once a party to them, they are more dependable than
other states with concentrated power at the executive
level]{.underline}. **[These [kind of durable commitments are of
interest to the United States as it seeks to preserve the liberal world
order]{.mark}]{.underline}**; [it is far more effective to ally with
partners whose institutions make withdrawal from the alliance
costly]{.underline}.

Finally, [it has been empirically observed that **[democracies do not go
to war with one another]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While there is a robust
debate around the exact nature of the so-called "democratic peace," it
[appears that there are qualities particular to democracies that make
war between them particularly unlikely: a **dovish public constrains
leaders' ability to wage war**]{.underline}, [competitive elections and
a free press make it **easier to credibly communicate resolve to
potential adversaries**]{.underline}, [consolidated democracies tend to
be **more wealthy and economically interdependent**]{.underline},
[like-minded people are more hesitant to wage war against one another,
and so on]{.underline}. Regardless of the precise mechanisms, however, a
[world of democracies is inherently safer, more prosperous, and less
likely to initiate a war against the United States --- a key factor in
protecting American security and interests]{.underline}.

The [global growth of the sector is likely to accelerate demand for the
pro ducts of biotech]{.underline}. New tools, decreasing costs and an
expanding skill base imply that more people in more places will have
access to more powerful technology (4,30,31). [Governments around the
globe are grappling with the desire to benefit from biotech-driven
economic developmen]{.underline}t, while simultaneously facing questions
about who should have access to which technology and under what
circumstances. The US government has taken an official position that
physical and economic security, in addition to economic and employment
growth, are best served by encouraging and embracing open access and
innovation in biotech in all contexts, \"from cutting-edge academic
institutes, to industrial research centers, to private laboratories in
basements and garages\" (32). This position sets the stage for a
necessary refocusing of biosecurity discussions and practices. Relying
on biotech to produce economic growth requires support both for research
and job creation and for safe and secure use in equal measure. These
goals are hampered at present by the lack of data and reporting on
biotech as an industry. Addressing these deficiencies in measurement is
a necessary first step in accurately quantifying the role of biotech in
the economy. The voluntary ignorance resulting from the absence of such
data confounds an understanding of national security that surely must
include the economic role of biotech in the context of both biological
production and natural resources. Consequently, it is important to
better discern the impact of underlying technological development on
physical and economic security and on the economy as a whole.
Biosecurity has typically been interpreted as the physical security of
individuals, institutions and the food supply in the context of threats
such as toxins and pathogens. These will, of course, continue to be
important concerns. Yet governments can no longer limit their concern to
the proverbial white powder produced in a state-sponsored lab, a
\'cave\' in Afghanistan or a garage in Seattle (33). Safeguarding the
large and rapidly growing bioeconomy requires embracing a more
substantial challenge; it is essential to have a refined and ongoing
understanding of what must be secured and from where threats might
arise. [Economic demand is driving technological proliferation, and the
revenue estimates described here must necessarily inform the evolving
definition of biosecurity]{.underline}. Alongside the preexisting
bioeconomy, we are building a [system composed of inherently
\'dual-use\' engineering technologies that will constitute critical
infrastructure for the future economy.]{.underline} Assuming that the
revenue and growth estimates above are borne out with improved
measurement and analysis, biosecurity is now clearly synonymous with
economic security. The focus of biosecurity policy must shift from
protecting specific targets from specific threats to securing the
bioeconomy as a system that increasingly drives economic growth and
employment and, ultimately, enables humans to thrive on a global scale.

https://warontherocks.com/2021/09/beyond//AL

Maintaining America's Biotechnology Advantage Biotechnology in the
United States is a significant contributor to the economy. By one
estimate, in 2017, U.S. biotechnology revenues exceeded \$400 billion,
or 2 percent of gross domestic product, substantially surpassing
better-measured sectors such as mining. Bioeconomy revenues have grown
at an average rate of 10 percent annually for two decades. Notably, U.S.
biotechnology revenues alone were approximately equal to worldwide
semiconductor revenues for 2017. Biotechnology now supplies critical
medicines, and, as more than 90 percent of the corn and soy grown in the
United States is genetically modified, biotechnology feeds the armed
forces. Industrial biotechnology is responsible for upward of 20 percent
of chemicals produced in the United States, suggesting a similar
proportion of chemicals used in the military are also biologically
derived. And these impressive figures may still be significant
underestimates: Using a different methodology, the U.S. National Academy
of Sciences recently concluded that the **[biotechnology industry
contributes 5 to 7 percent of U.S. gross domestic
product]{.underline}**. Biotechnology, therefore, may already constitute
an even larger share of the military supply chain. As biotechnology
continues to mature, its contribution to physical and economic security
will become even more significant. Tools are now being deployed that
enable the engineering and biomanufacturing of materials that will
eventually not only displace petrochemicals but also surpass them in
production scale and performance. Over the next ten to twenty years,
biological production could soon supply up to 60 percent of physical
inputs across the global economy, and **[biotechnology could have a
"direct economic impact of up to \$4 trillion a year." While the United
States is arguably still leading in biotechnology, it risks losing this
lead to Chin]{.underline}**a. In China, biotechnology is a national
development and a security matter. **[China's Innovation Driven
Development Strategy emphasizes biotechnology's essential role in the
country's economic development]{.underline}**, while the Military-Civil
Fusion Development Strategy seeks to ensure that biotechnology research
is also oriented toward the country's military and broader security
goals. **[Chinese biotechnology revenues are reported to be of a similar
size to those in the United States,]{.underline}** although they are
subject to even lesser clarity in reporting. While China continues its
licit and illicit acquisition efforts targeting the U.S. biotechnology
sector, it is also shifting its attention to domestic innovation. In
time, this will provide the People's Liberation Army with new
capabilities and increase both America's and the Pentagon's reliance on
Chinese biotechnology products.

### SPD \-- NATO-US Bioethical Network guide

**[A Broader Context for Soft Power Diplomacy]{.underline}** (SPD) One
of the more common examples used to describe the demonstrable
effectiveness of SPD is its application in global communication via
broadcasting media. For example, in the aftermath of World Wars II, when
the Cold War had just begun between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, Radio
Free Europe and Radio Liberty were created by the United States and the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) as conduits to provide more
accurate world news to listeners all over the world, particularly to the
audience in Eastern Europe, South East Asia, East Asia, Africa, and
Latin America. Cultural centers were created all over the world as
another conduit to communicate the merits of democracy and a free market
society to the common man. A long-term objective was to use these
communicated merits to generate admiration and respect for the West. It
is interesting to note that SPD tools related to [communication were
instituted as public diplomacy to alter the behavior of foreign
powers]{.underline} by influencing its citizens. The basic asArticles

2012 sumption was that if public opinion in a nation or region is molded
towards objectives favorable to the West, this would create internal
pressure for the hostile foreign government to alter its behavior
towards its rivals and ideologies. Many decades of investment in global
broadcasting programs during the Cold War yielded desirable results,
measured by the fact that more nations in the world have elected
governments and open economies, and espouse free trade than ever before.
Modern communication technologies---particularly the interactive forms
of social networking and the Worldwide Web---have introduced radically
new mechanisms to communicate and share information, which are likely to
play a major role as soft powers (Nye, 1990). The participation of
non-state actors, such as the non-governmental organizations (NGOs),
transnational corporations (TNCs), and transnational media corporations
(TMCs), has further empowered SPD tools in global communication through
social networking media. Tehranian (1997) reported that there are over
30,000 NGOs compared to 200 state actors, but if the number of TNCs and
TMCs is taken into account, a significant level of complexity and
role-play for SPD in international relations has been added. The
scientific **[community has embraced the latest technological
innovations in communications and information sharing with the utmost
enthusiasm]{.underline}**. This is evidenced by a growing number of
online versions of peer-review journals, web sites, and portals
exclusively devoted to new biology and life sciences research; here, a
vast global network of scientists and technical experts can share
information on their current research interests, findings, and
guidelines for others to experiment and validate. The open forum used by
the scientific community fosters transparency, promotes
information-sharing, and propels innovation in research and development.
Simultaneously, this environment poses serious security issues on what
are generally known as DURC. No regulatory mandates oversee and monitor
the vast online media currently used by the scientific community, and it
is safe to assume that mandated regulations are less likely to modulate
individual scientists regarding ethical questions related to DURC and
its potential impact on the research institutional safety and national
security. Within this context is where employment of SPD options might
prove more effective in modulating behavior through voluntary means.
There are good examples, albeit from other industry sectors, where use
of SPD options has yielded desirable outcomes. Public diplomacy related
to national and international policy on environmental protection and
promotion of equity in labor laws and workman compensations has yielded

positive outcomes of global significance. For instance, in global labor
governance---in the absence of a formal legal
framework---self-regulation, norm setting, and international labor codes
provided a policy premise attractively referred to as "voluntaristic
initiatives" (Hassel, 2008). Remarkably, the SPD measures to rectify
global labor governance did not stem from national governments or from
multilateral forums such as the United Nations or the World Trade
Organization. Instead, the public diplomacy channeled through mass media
and social networking created broader global awareness on issues related
to workplace safety and compensation. As a result of increased global
public awareness and response by way of consumer boycotts, the private
sector adopted more progressive workman compensation programs and
invested in improving the quality of workplace conditions, for they
could not afford to ignore the collective voice of their consumers
(Hassel, 2008). As a result, we now witness a vast number of large,
multinational corporations embracing good labor practices and even
publicizing these efforts in the marketing of their products. Companies
now tout their safe workplace environment, good wages, and best labor
practices as part of a corporate culture because it is popular now to be
socially responsible. While one could argue that some sectors within the
industry have adopted ethical practices because it is the right thing to
do, a compelling argument could be made that it makes a better business
case offering or a better economic incentive, or arguably that it is a
necessity for companies to meet or exceed the ethical demands of
consumers and their special interest groups. SPD in this case could be
interpreted as the collective voice of consumers that now has a huge
influence on the global marketplace and the international economy. A
broader global acceptance of an environmentally friendly "green policy"
is yet another example where SPD measures have made a significant impact
on environmental diplomacy when environmental treaty-making systems were
deemed less effective (Susskind, 1994). SPD in environmental diplomacy
offered self-enforcing options to nationstates without compromising
their sovereignty and promoted better coordination among the various
institutions involved. NGOs working on environment and global ecosystem
protection promoted SPD tools and measures as part of global agreements
aimed at environmental sustainability, greater awareness of pollution,
and the need for environmental protection. Progress was made possible in
this arena by carefully crafted SPD tools and methodologies that were
deployed to influence government policymakers and regulators, private
and public sectors, academia, and the international media. **[Soft Power
Diplomacy to Counter Biological Threats]{.underline}** It is evident
from the preceding section that SPD tools and methodologies have
remarkable success in the formulation and implementation of national and
international policies related to public health, trade and commerce, and
protection of the environment and ecosystem. Human pursuits to
understand natural processes through research and discovery are
essential aspects of our society, and therefore, SPD tools [imparting
education and training for aspiring scientists to increase awareness on
the dual-use threats and instill code of conduct for responsible
behavior may succeed as well**. Existing biological threat-related
mandates are mostly hard regulations promulgated**]{.underline} either
at the national level or a binding requirement under the existing
international biological arms control regime. However, during the past 2
decades, policymakers, life sciences researchers, and the biotechnology
industrial community have evidenced interest in exploring SPD tools and
methodologies in what could be the architecture for future biological
engagements covering research and development, global health security,
and protection against new and emerging diseases and threats of
bioterrorism. Unfortunately, [progress in bioengagement architecture
remains fragmented due to a divergent stakeholder community and an
overall lack of understanding of the potentials of misuse of new
frontiers in modern biological research and development.]{.underline}
Bioethics-based SPD provides the [enduring quality of higher-order
thinking and enhancement of quality of life]{.underline} through
self-imposed behavior modification, which is [inherently appealing to
the research and policy communities.]{.underline} Understanding the
moral dimensions of the emerging health and biological systems, and
analyzing them according to the bioethical principles and core value
system of the community, will drive decision making at the bottom
levels, where the practice of science and medicine occurs. SPD will
[provide the conceptual framework to evaluate a series of competing
options and illuminate the inherent recognition]{.underline} that there
is no single moral course of action. Practical application of a
bioethics-inspired SPD framework faces fundamental challenges.

First, policy analysts and researchers working on SPD in the
international arena often cite the sheer complexity of the legal and
technical issues involved in domains such as global nonproliferation
treaties, international labor laws, and environmental protections that
render hard regulations less effective in the long run (Sisson &
Marginson, 2001). This would apply to any treaty-based efforts towards
nonproliferation of biological weapons given the sheer size, scope, and
complexity of modern biological research and the vast and varied
applications in the biotechnology domain. For instance, the 1972 BWC has
no provision for enforcement because of the fundamental difficulties
with verifiability of treaty compliance. A key problem with the
implementation of verification is that the BWC applies not only to
sovereign entities but also to private parties as well. Unlike nuclear
nonproliferation treaties (and the AntiBallistic Missile Treaty \[ABM\]
which involves sovereign nations' commitment to reduction and eventual
elimination through mutually verifiable and implementable protocols),
biological treaty verification covers an extremely vast array of
stakeholders involving the private sector, university research
laboratories, and contract research facilities in biotechnology R&D and
commercial development. A formal inspection regime is bound to be
ineffective, and compliance verification is nearly impossible. Second,
[bioethics-based SPD approaches are likely to be more effective in the
globalized biotechnology research and commercial
environment]{.underline}, where business-to-business contacts and
networked strategic communication have assumed a prominent role in
engaging the stakeholder communities. SPD tools and methodologies are
better suited to exploit the evolving social networking and other
platforms for communication and information-sharing such as professional
societies, disease surveillance and reporting networks, data sharing and
reporting systems, and collaborative research programs. SPD tools will
greatly benefit the global biotechnology research community and the
industry that depends on new biologics-based product development and
commercialization. Likewise, global informationsharing on disease
prevention and health promotion through the 2005 World Health
Organization's International Health Regulations (IHR) (WHO, 2005) brings
the global comity of 194 nations as state parties to voluntarily share
diseasespecific information through a standard reporting format. The
goal to harmonize global rules to categories of infectious disease
identification and reporting has inherent appeal as a SPD, where the
broader aims are to enhance national, regional, and global public health
security. Finally, bioethics-inspired SPD tools offer more flexible
approaches to addressing thorny issues, such as conflicts of interest
among stakeholders involved in various aspects of public- and
private-funded biotechnology ventures, compared to mandated compliance
with national regulations or treaty obligatory requirements. This is
basically due to the fundamental differences in the enforcement between
SPD and mandatory regulations. Whereas, successful implementation of a
mandate is primarily via some form of legal sanction or a form of
punishment, SPD methodologies carry no such punishments due to
noncompliance. Instead, SPD approaches are primarily driven by ethical
and moral implications of advances in biomedical sciences and on value
judgments pertaining to code of conduct and responsible behavior in the
areas of biological research and biotechnology. SPD tools such as
peer-review audits, institutional review boards, best business
practices, and institution collaboration are premised on professional
responsibility and practitioners' voluntary commitment to adhere to
institutional-level oversight and the broader ethical and moral
questions related to science, medicine, health, life, and the
environment. Education and Training as SPD Training and educational
programs in bioethics and biosecurity as part of university curricula
towards advanced degrees in modern biology and biomedical sciences would
considerably promote aspiring scientists' awareness of dualuse threats
and recognition of biorisks in their own work and in that of others.
Unfortunately, in current university curricula for students, few
educational modules exist regarding ethics training on biological and
biomedical tracks, and even those few programs treat biosecurity and
dual-use issues only superficially. A case-study of bioethics training
in the United Kingdom reported that biosecurity-related education
received scarce attention from educators, and bioethics course modules
reviewed during the study did not adequately address biosecurity and
dual-use issues (Revill, 2009). To a large measure, training in
bioethics would serve as the lynchpin in educational programs, bringing
up the moral obligations and expectations of responsible behavior on the
part of the scientific community regarding the potential security
implications of dual-use research (Kuhlau et al., 2008; Selfelid, 2009).
Institutions such as Bradford University (Bradford, England) with
leading-edge educational programs in bioethics and biosecurity have
focused on educational criteria to identify biorisks and obligatory
measures on the part of life scientists to take preventive measures. The
SPD-based moral obligations offer training modules to: a) **[prevent
bioterrorism]{.underline}**; b) **[engage in responsible
activities]{.underline}**; c) **[recognize negative implications of
dualuse research]{.underline}**; d) **[avoid submitting for publication
study results posing biosecurity risks]{.underline}**; e) **[participate
in educational and training programs promoting biorisk awareness and
dual-use risks]{.underline}**; f) **[maintain oversight of dangerous
pathogens and toxic substances in the laboratory]{.underline}**; and
g**[) develop a protocol to deal with suspicious activities of students
and laboratory staff]{.underline}**. Training modules addressing these
core criteria should be available more broadly, both as part of formal
educational programs and on-the-job training programs for staff and
laboratory operators. Recognizing the value of dual-use education for
scientists, the BTWC Review Conferences have repeatedly identified
education, awareness-raising, and ethics training on code of conduct and
responsible behavior to prevent potential misuse of biological research
(BTWC, 2008). However, no clear guidelines are available to state
parties on the nature of educational and training programs,
implementation metrics, and performance measures. Given the vast scope
and scale of the modern global biological research enterprise,
educational programs for national implementation ought to address a much
broader range of activities if the goal is to prevent misuse of research
and prevent acquisition and use of biological weapons. This is yet
another justification to more actively consider SPD-based tools to
impart broader awareness through bioethics and biosecurity education and
training programs. **[Moving Toward a Global Bioethics
Network]{.underline}** The conceptual architecture guiding
bioethics-inspired SPD will resonate with a) the medical ethics first
written in the 18th century by Thomas Percival, which forms the code of
ethics in the practice of clinical medicine and the ethical framework in
the 1846 creation of the American Medical Association, and b) the
Nuremberg Code for research ethics, established in the aftermath of
World War II, on the use of human subjects in experimental research
(Mitscherlich & Mielke, 1947). In 1979, the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services issued the first historical document on ethical
principles and guidelines for the protection of human subjects. This was
known as "The Belmont Report" and provided a set of bioethics-inspired
principles of respect, beneficence, and justice as the foundation for
use of human subjects in medical research (DHHS, 1979). Most recently,
the 2009 Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues for
the first time addressed more broadly the bioethical issues related to
advances in biomedical sciences research and biotechnology and explored
SPD options to ensure the freedom to pursue scientific research and
innovative technology development in a socially and ethically
responsible manner (DHHS, 2012). These guidelines offer a conceptually
cohesive framework to the more challenging task of crafting SPD
approaches taking into account the difficult bioethical issues
surrounding the spectacular progress in biomedical and genomic research.
It is relevant to note that the conceptual elements of SPD and
regulatory mandates and treaty obligations have interdependencies, and
the overall effectiveness of the former is linked to the policy-guiding
development and implementation of the latter. Figure 2 illustrates [the
interdependency of SPD with the policy-making and regulatory
establishment and implementation process. Mandatory regulations by
design require compulsory compliance and stipulate penalties for
noncompliance]{.underline}. Hence, success in a large measure depends on
faithful compliance by the regulated community, which is where SPD tools
and methods come into play. Defined more broadly as a process that
effects a change in attitude upon a willing subject without invoking the
regulatory mandates, SPD aims to enhance voluntary stakeholder
participation towards the broader regulatory objectives set forth under
the mandates. Simultaneously, SPD tools and methodologies [offer the
regulatory community feedback on the mandates to allow further
modifications in the regulatory process to improve implementation
effectiveness and to better coordinate with the regulated
community.]{.underline} Therefore, maintaining internal consistency with
mandatory regulation is a crucial aspect in the formulation of SPD
strategies. [We propose bioethically-inspired SPD tools and
methodologies be closely linked to the existing regulatory process to
ensure consistency in communication and to assess overall
compliance.]{.underline} Key criteria would involve identification and
delineation of the essential conceptual elements of SPD architecture.
The decision-making process in a clinical or laboratory setting among
two or more seemingly conflicting choices often revolves around
anticipated positive or negative outcomes at different levels: Articles

Applied Biosafety Vol. 17, No. 3, 2012 a) The first set of decision
points revolves around individual needs and interests weighted against
those of the community, where choices may present options beneficial to
one while placing a serious burden on the other. b) The second set of
decision points revolves around short- and long-term benefits, where
options offering immediate short-term benefits require careful
consideration of long-term impact on human society and the general
environment. c) The third and final set of decision points revolves
around the balanced consideration of administering justice as opposed to
the relevance of mercy to the affected community. For example, the
decision to provide licensure for a new category of medical
countermeasures may address a serious public health problem but at the
same time pose an unquantified measure of risk to population subgroups
likely to be exposed to the new medical countermeasures.
Bioethics-inspired SPD should recognize the basic dilemma presented in
each of these decision points where competing values are at play.
Therefore, the need for a SPDguided decision-making process would extend
beyond the professional communities and their governing institutions.
The bioethics-inspired SPD roadmap would have to engage a broader
participation of society-at-large since the overall impact is on the
human society as a whole. A global bioethical network of broader
stakeholder communities will be actively involved in the formulation of
SPD tools and methodologies that go beyond the narrow confines of
regulatory mandates. Figure 3 illustrates the functional components of
bioethics-inspired SPD tools and methodologies, where considerable
emphasis is placed at the individual and institutional level and
provides transparency to a wide array of stakeholder communities
throughout the network. Nodal elements participating in the network
would participate in dialogue and discussions ranging from: a)
initiatives to modify behavior at the individual level that results in
self-governance; b) balanced consideration on threats to populations
versus individuals as in the case of bioterrorism; c) methods to
safeguard DURC and intellectual properties produced through research;
and d) approaches to improve biosecurity without hindering the
advancement of biomedical science research and technology innovations.
As illustrated in Figure 3, [the proposed SRM tools and methodologies of
a global bioethical network are directed primarily at individual
scientists and the institutional-level decision makers with a guiding
rationale that better outcomes are realizable]{.underline} when
implemented proactively as a voluntary initiative to broadly promote
education, awareness and active participation: • Peer-review (for both
ethics and safety) of research proposals to ensure that proposed
research is fully vetted prior to initiation of the project. Articles
are already being reviewed by most of the popular publications to ensure
that gained knowledge is not publicly available if it should be
determined a threat to biosecurity (Johnson, 2012). Articles Figure 3
Soft power diplomacy tools and methodologies constituting the conceptual
architecture for a Global Bioethical Network guide national security
policymakers and the stakeholders in the scientific community. •
Research checklists to aid scientists in determining if their research
takes into account all the concerns of biosecurity and also to help
ingrain the standards through repetitious use of the tool. • Dual-use
plan for publicly funded projects in the future (e.g., animal use plan).
Currently, biosafety plans are required when submitting grant proposals,
but it should become a standard practice for government-funded research
to also require a plan to ensure the protection of dual-use information
through a "dual-use plan." • Clearinghouse for scientists to direct
questions and to determine if a piece of information or specific
research area is a biosecurity concern. • Advisory boards at the state
level similar to the U.S. National Science Advisory Board for
Biosecurity (DHHS, 2012) with the aim to better utilize local and
regional capabilities for oversight and to promote educational
awareness. • Research assessment template for individual assessment of
potential research. • Global forums and NGOs can serve as venues for
best practices and experiences to be shared. We should focus on creating
communities at this level and down to the individual. • A list of
proposed obligations for life scientists as a set of standard, widely
accepted, best practices from peers across the field. • Training on best
practices. As illustrated in Figure 3, performance outcome depends on
proactive initiatives at the individual level and voluntary
participation of institutions in the overall process. Unlike the
established regulatory framework that depends solely on enforcement by
authorities at the national and international levels, the SPD framework
for the bioethical network is proactive, participatory, and
fundamentally based on the awareness of the community. National science
policymakers have considered policy options and research standards, and
best business practices to oversee DURC without compromise on the
essential core tenants of the freedom to pursue biological research
(Shea, 2007). These efforts are in concert with concurrent initiatives
from the scientific community (NRC, 2004). However, the framework
outlined in this study formally integrates a systems approach to the
evolving consensus in the scientific community towards simultaneous
measures that promote self-regulation at the individual level and better
biosecurity measures at the institutional level, both supported by
increased biodefense-related awareness and educational programs
(Dolgister, 2007). The global bioethical network would serve as the SPD
architecture to develop in a proactive manner in tandem with major
international forums, such as the Intersessional Working Groups of the
BWC and the World Health Organization, aimed at broadening the network
of communities and providing a forum to develop and test novel SPD
tools. These tools are aimed at improved awareness of biological risks
and a better understanding of the threats posed by new and emerging
infectious diseases. The network would [provide a forum for sustained
interactions among various participants and a cross-cultural dialogue on
the development of national systems for research ethics, education, and
outreach]{.underline}. Recommendations National security policymakers
examining alternate options to meet the goals of biological threat
reduction through treaties and hard regulations ought to place more
emphasis on the potential role of SPD tools and methodologies for
developing universal norms towards open-source bioethics. Policymakers
should note the effective precedence in the contemporary international
arena to articulating SPD approaches as alternative options to meet the
goals and objectives of the treaty- and legislation-based hard
regulations. • Leverage growing awareness: National security
policymakers should consider SPD-based policy alternatives to more
effectively leverage the growing awareness among scientific researchers
towards self-regulation and the promotion of responsible conduct in
research. Institutionlevel guidelines on research misconduct, safe
handling of sensitive data and materials, and a peer-review process in
research publications that takes biosecurity into account are also
required. Clearly, regulatory mandates and international treaties are
partial solutions to addressing the sensitive and contentious bioethcial
challenges associated with biological threat reduction and biosecurity.
• Alternative options to empower regulatory mandates: A
bioethics-inspired SPD framework has the power to dramatically alter the
nature of discussions related to biosecurity in the life sciences
research enterprise. In particular, the dynamic of the SPD framework
should address the shortcomings in existing regulatory mandates in the
biotechnology-driven Bioeconomy, where not much is known of its inherent
hazards and potential long-term impact on human society, the general
environment, and national/international security. • Engage the global
community on the merits of SPD initiatives: Bioethics-inspired SPD is
attractive for its enduring quality of high-order thinking that shapes
quality-oflife goals. A deliberate process aimed at embracing the moral
dimensions of human endeavors, such as in conducting research with
troubling ethical dimensions, with the potential to adversely impact
health and the general environment, will guide decision making at the
operational level. • Integrate bioethics-based SPD as part of education
curricula: Given the broad interdisciplinary nature of the SPD tools and
methodologies, universities and institutions should develop educational
and specialized training programs catering to students pursuing careers
in science and technology, law, public policy, and business. These
training programs should focus on the nonbinding rules or instruments in
the SPD and approaches to integrate these tools within the existing
regulatory framework. Biosafety professionals have stressed the value of
well structured educational programs on codes of conduct, biosafety, and
biosecurity as a prerequisite for graduation in advanced university
education and training programs (Johnson, 2006). Bioethics-inspired SPD
tools and methodologies could also play a meaningful role in biological
arms control and biological threat reduction goals. They could aid in
carefully evaluating and deciding among a series of competing options,
but with the inherent recognition that there is no single moral course
of action. Active participation from the scientific and policy
communities is essential to further articulate the influential role of
SPD in countering biothreat proliferation and to gain participation of
other stakeholders

Applied Biosafety 17 (2012): 110 -- 119//AL

Introduction Much of the current focus in biodefense, aimed at
countering current and emerging biological threats, has been
interdisciplinary in scope, drawn mostly from the foundational ethical
guidelines for medicine, science, public health, law, the environment,
war, and international relations. As a result, biodefense and
counter-bioterrorism programs at national and international levels have
sought to employ conventional regulatory frameworks by merging a
collection of concepts and guidelines implemented as "hard regulations,"
but without systematically addressing the unique challenges posed by
biodefense and biological threats. Technical and policy experts concur
that **[hard regulations are likely to be counterproductive in the long
run]{.underline}**, when the academic research and [private enterprise
business models thrive on the basic principle of freedom to pursue
scientific research and free exchange of information]{.underline} among
the community of researchers and biotechnology business entrepreneurs
(Roland, 2007). Public policymakers in government and multilateral
agencies faced with challenging tasks involving environmental
protection, national security, economic policy, healthcare, and labor
laws are beginning to explore a range of options that include
command-and-control type regulations and others involving participatory
instruments and working with stakeholders to change behavior (Gaudioso &
Salerno, 2004; Gunningham & Sinclair, 1998). For example, comparative
risk assessment is increasingly used as a decision-making tool in the
environmental and public health policy decision-making process involving
the scientific community, public policymakers, and public stakeholder
communities (Alm & Rao, 1994). The U.S. National Research Council
employed a biological risk assessment paradigm to assess the operational
safety of advanced emerging pathogen disease research laboratories (NRC,
2010a), or the maximum credibility event-based environmental consequence
analysis to assess safety of high biocontainment laboratories (NRC,
2010b). From a public policy standpoint, some experts and professional
organizations have suggested the use of the public health model proposed
by Buchanan (2000), where individual interests are subordinated to the
interests of the common good of society as **[the guiding framework for
what might constitute a "soft regulation" to biodefense bioethics and a
basis for countering biological]{.underline}** proliferation
**[threats]{.underline}**. Guzman and Meyer (2011) have proposed a
formulation for international **[soft law on international common law to
form the basis for international tribunals towards nonbinding
interpretations of binding legal rules.]{.underline}** As a result,
[legal consequences flow from a range of nonbinding international
instruments similar to expert committee recommendations and advisories
and guidelines developed by regulatory agencies in the domestic setting
that do not have enforcement powers or legal consequences due to
noncompliance.]{.underline} Legal experts have opined that the
**[quasi-legal characteristic of international soft law will be
attractive to state parties engaged in a multilateral forum on a
regional or international issue]{.underline}**. Application of soft
regulations is a well-established mechanism in international diplomacy,
such as in regional and global multilateral fora aimed at global health
protection (Magnusson, 2007; Sutton, 2009; WHO, 2003), prevention and
elimination of chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction (Lee,
2004), labor laws (Borghijs et al., 2003; Kuruvilla & Verma, 2006),
environmental protection (Alm & Rao, 1994; Koutalakis et al., 2010), and
human rights (Andorno, 2009, 2007; Hillgenberg, 1999). Articles Soft

17, No. 3, 2012 111 Using illustrative examples from these
well-established international initiatives, this article outlines the
basic framework for a soft regulatory mechanism as part of regional or
global efforts to coordinate the pursuit of scientific investigations
and to manage biological threat proliferation. At the conclusion of the
2006 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) meeting. titled "Sixth Review
Conference of the State Parties to the Biological Weapons Convention,"
held in Geneva, it was concluded that national implementation would
remain the biggest challenge during the 2007-2010 Intersessional
program, which focused on regional cooperation; biosafety and
biosecurity; oversight measures for biological research; and increased
awareness, educational measures, and international cooperation in
biological science and technology. BWC review conferences implement a
quasi-regulatory framework to meet the goal of the treaty, which is to
promote the development of the peaceful uses of biological agents and
toxins. The confidencebuilding measures outlined in these sessions are
supposed to provide practical steps to increase the level of

participation at the national level and of various stakeholders in the
biological research and the biotechnology industry communities.
Exploring confidence-building measures in the context of the BWC might
offer attractive alternatives in the formulation of advisories and
guidelines as policies related to ethical, political and social issues
have grown in tandem with the spectacular advancement in biological
research and biotechnology. Evidently, **[scientific progress has
outpaced science policy formulation,]{.underline}** particularly
regarding contentious bioethical issues. A growing concern over DURC
among scientific researchers and security experts has provided
sufficient impetus to explore alternate policies aimed at soft
regulatory options (Sutton, 2009). [Current]{.underline} mandates or
treaty [frameworks]{.underline}---be they at the national or
international levels---are [nowhere closer to addressing the intricacies
of the policy challenges posed by advanced biotech]{.underline}nology;
therefore, conventional regulatory mechanisms are not part of a
long-term solution. Background In one of the first conferences of its
kind in Europe, a panel of experts explored the ethical implications of
scientific research on bioweapons and prevention of bioterrorism (EC,
2004). More recently, the NATO Advanced Research Workshop (ARW),
"Ethics, Morality and the Law: Managing Bioterrorism Threats," convened
an international panel of experts to discuss topics related to
biodefense and bioterrorism. This has the potential to have a seminal
impact on a wide range of national and regional security programs and
science-policy areas covering life sciences research and development,
dual-use research, health security, and managing bioterrorism threats
(DTRA, 2010). In both events, participating experts were specifically
tasked to: [a) identify mutually contrasting and overlapping viewpoints
on the interdisciplinary areas related to bioethics, life sciences
research, jurisprudence, and bioterrorism preparedness and response
initiatives; b) create a conceptual framework for extended discussions
and interactions among the domain experts and key stakeholders; and c)
recommend action plans for a systematic process to begin sustained
engagements among key stakeholders at national and international
levels]{.underline}. The discussions during the 3-day ARW covered an
array of views and positions regarding contemporary bioethics and
potential implications on education and awareness, advanced biological
research and development, national and regional security, and legal and
moral implications when managing bioterrorism response (Magnusson, 2007;
Rao, 2010a). A key observation from the ARW deliberations was that
better understanding and delineation of the public policy domains is the
first point where bioethical issues directly juxtapose national security
challenges. Relevant topics for further consideration were improved
awareness and education, opportunities towards manpower training and
harmonization, as well as the implications of bioethical issues involved
in life sciences research and biosecurity (Rao, 2010b). Figure 1 lists
topics discussed at the 2010 ARW where bioethics-related issues are
likely to overlap with operational challenges associated with the
implementation of bioterrorism preparedness and response measures. ARW
participants considered these (among other key themes) as the basis for
a more detailed review and discussion. Identification of these
overlapping domains was a key milestone at the 2010 ARW. The working
group considered these topics as the basis for constructing a sustained
engagement aimed at improved awareness and education, review of DURC,
and further exploration of policy options towards "soft" regulations and
harmonization of best practices.

in Biotech Policy---A US Perspective,\" No Publication,
https://itif.org/publications/2022/03/11/prospects-transatlantic-cooperation-biotech-policy-us-perspective//AL

[Mutual self-interest provides a strong basis for transatlantic
cooperation in biotec]{.underline}hnology based on shared recognition of
its **[vast potential]{.underline}** to provide solutions to some of
civilization's most pressing problems. Thanks to explosive advances in
our understanding of the many ways in which promiscuous nature has been
manipulating DNA and RNA for the past billion years, it is widely
anticipated that the 21st century will belong to biology.1 We are [**now
at the point where our ability to innovate is constrained** less by
technical capability than by the limits of our
imaginations.]{.underline} Multiple laboratories and companies on both
sides of the Atlantic (and throughout the world) are pursuing promising
applications, and experience confirms progress would be accelerated by
cooperative approaches. But there are some considerable challenges,
especially in agricultural and industrial contexts. The most important
rate-[limiting factor in our ability to harness biological
innovations]{.underline} to the challenges of feeding the world,
sustaining human and environmental health, and addressing climate
change[, is the burden imposed by ill-considered
regulations]{.underline}. [Unless this bottleneck can be unblocked, the
enormous potential for transatlantic scientific cooperation will not
yield the necessary fruits.]{.underline} DIVERGENT REGULATORY PATHS:
PRECAUTION VS. OPENNESS TO INNOVATION [Existing policies]{.underline},
legislation, and regulations [do]{.underline} little or
**[nothing]{.underline}** to advance human or environmental safety.2
Born out of understandable caution at the dawn of recombinant DNA
technologies, today their most obvious impact is to obstruct and
discourage research, development, and deployment of innovative solutions
to various challenges.3 This is so despite an abundant record of
production and consumption of new biotech products with enviable records
of improved safety, superior sustainability, and widespread beneficial
economic impacts.4 The benefits are so substantial that a pattern has
emerged of farmers breaking the law to acquire and plant improved seeds
in countries where governments have lagged in allowing access.5 It is
one thing to implement policies and regulations ostensibly designed to
ensure safety; it is quite another to [ignore vast data and decades of
experience around the world to maintain obsolete policies]{.underline}
and regulations that add nothing to safety or sustainability, but [only
impede our ability to use the most innovative]{.underline}, precise, and
safest [tools]{.underline} to address our gravest challenges.6 In terms
of regulatory policy and openness to biological innovations, the width
of the Atlantic might be measured better in light years than miles or
[kilometers. As imperfect as regulations for the products of
biotechnology are in North America, they are simply indefensible in
Europe]{.underline}.7 The [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[decided in 1986,]{.underline} after years of study and consultation,
**[that no new laws were required to ensure the safety of crops and
foods improved through biotech]{.underline}**nology. This was based on
the finding that they present no novel hazards, and foreseeable risks of
their development and use fall into categories with which humans have
considerable experience from millennia of conventional plant and animal
breeding.8 The United States therefore decided to regulate these novel
products under existing authorities administered by the Department of
Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and Environmental
Protection Agency.9 While implementation of this policy, the
["Coordinated Framework," has been far from perfect]{.underline}, it has
been sufficiently predictable and science-based to enable an explosion
of innovation, new product development, and commercial activity.
Consequently, the United States has led the world to the present day
wherein crops improved through biotechnology are now the global standard
for quality seeds, delivering improved yields, safety, sustainability,
and economic productivity around the world, with the lion's share of
benefits accruing on behalf of small farmers in developing countries.10
**[Europe]{.underline}** took a different approach. It is one thing to
implement policies and regulations ostensibly designed to ensure safety;
it is quite another to **[ignore vast data and decades of experience
around the world to maintain obsolete policies]{.underline}** and
regulations that add nothing to safety or sustainability. The European
Union decided to regulate seeds improved through biotechnology as a
novel class governed under new regulations specifically focused on an
arbitrary category known as "GMOs" (for "genetically modified
organisms"). The conceit was that because they represented gene
combinations produced by mechanisms supposedly "not found in nature"
(but actually ubiquitous) they must present novel hazards, even though
none has ever been identified. These putatively novel hazards, despite
the lack of any concrete manifestations, allegedly required dedicated,
specific, "precautionary" regulations. The **[resulting regulatory
regime proved so burdensome it led to the general collapse of
ag]{.underline}**ricultural **[biotech]{.underline}**nology in Europe,
which had played a leading role in its discovery and invention.
Permissions for field trials proved almost impossible to obtain,
products could not be developed and brought to market, academic labs
abandoned the field, and the industry relocated most of its assets and
activities to the Americas. And Europe became the world's largest
importer of commodity foods improved through biotechnology, only
recently surpassed by China. OPPORTUNITY FOR TRANSATLANTIC COOPERATION
Many scientists in the EU (and around the world) knew from the beginning
that this was the wrong approach, **[yet the EU pushed its model
internationally,]{.underline}** [with aggressive diplomacy]{.underline},
leading to emulation by many countries in the developing world, with
[equally unhappy results to those seen in Europe]{.underline}.11 But a
growing number of scientists, policymakers, and even "green" NGOs that
had originally opposed GMOs, now recognize the counterproductive results
of this approach and are working to avoid repeating the same mistakes
with gene editing. This shines [a spotlight on the most important and
potentially fruitful opportunity for transatlantic cooperation in
biotech]{.underline}nology: the [revival of science-based regulatory
regimes in which the degree of regulatory oversight is proportional to
the hazards involved, and regulation that enables]{.underline}, [rather
than discourages the safe development of innovative
products]{.underline}. A return to and reaffirmation of these first
principles would provide **[fertile ground for cooperation and
coordination globally]{.underline}**. **[Regulatory
reform]{.underline}** (everywhere, not just in the EU and its emulators,
though the need is greatest there) provides fertile ground for
transatlantic cooperation and coordination. We have robust models of
proven approaches.12 Without such cooperation, other progress in
developing and deploying innovative solutions through biotechnology will
be impeded or foregone. As to national security risks, just as with
other risks, novelty attributable to biotechnology is elusive. One can
do very nasty things with conventional bioweapons, and they are easily
magnified with recombinant DNA techniques. At the same time, defensive
capacities are also buttressed by biotechnology, as demonstrated by the
rapid development of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. There has been
some good work done in this area, but this topic is worth exploring at
greater depth. The OECD has a track record of thoughtful analyses with
such topics. One possibility would be to [build on that foundation by
establishing a joint]{.underline} OECD/**[NATO working group to serve as
a forum.]{.underline}**

### Allies say yes 

#### Empirically NATO say's yes to plans on emerging tech

Modernization Efforts,\" SIGNAL Magazine,

[NATO is accelerating its efforts to input innovation into its
operational capabilities]{.underline}. This effort is **[aided both by
industry and academia and by different nations]{.underline}** that bring
new technology applications to the alliance table. But even the best
ideas are encountering speed bumps, and adversaries are moving quickly
to exploit their own technological advances. Through its Allied Command
Transformation (ACT), headquartered in Norfolk, Virginia, NATO has
focused capability development on emerging technologies that can change
battlespace operations. An innovation center developed with local
academia is earmarked to grow into a full-fledged laboratory that would
seed new capabilities into the force. And the ACT is improving NATO's
state-of-the-art battlefield network to accommodate advances in command
and control (C2). One advantage NATO has for innovation is strength in
numbers. The [alliance's]{.underline} 29 [members all have innovation
assets that can be brought to bear in planning future military
systems.]{.underline} Yet that broad membership also offers a
significant drawback. The [alliance]{.underline} must [agree on systems
that meet advanced capabilities and are interoperable]{.underline} among
NATO's members. Lt. Gen. Thomas J. Sharpy, USAF, deputy chief of staff
for capability development at the ACT, offers that the command is
looking to the future to maintain a military edge across all the
capabilities it delivers. This involves making sure it is applying
innovation to either adapt current capabilities or revamp them, building
on progress from science and technology advances in industry, academia
and other nations. "Hockey great Wayne Gretzky once said, 'Good hockey
players skate to where the puck is; great hockey players skate to where
the puck is going to be,'" the general relates. "We are trying to figure
out where the puck is going to be and develop those capabilities so that
we maintain that military edge as our competitors are trying to do the
exact same thing," he declares. The ACT has stood up an innovation
branch within the capability development directorate to go with an
innovation hub partnered with Old Dominion University. Gen. Sharpy notes
that the directorate is moving ahead with plans to escalate this hub
into a laboratory that would enable incremental as well as open
innovation through academia. With the growth of this center, the ACT
would [align resources to extend innovation]{.underline} across all
aspects of the ACT. He describes this innovation center as "very
effective at integrating with academia and like-minded personnel amongst
the alliance." It also is working with people who are not part of NATO
to capture innovation as it emerges. He looks to improve this effort by
providing the center with more resources and more people. This would
enable it to be a laboratory where ideas could be cultivated with
industry for demonstrations by the military. Another advantage would be
that the facility is located in the United States, so U.S. participants
would not have to travel to and across Europe to deal with NATO. The ACT
has developed an emerging disruptive technology road map that focuses on
command and control, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), automation,
hypersonics and other areas that many nations also are exploring. This
effort is part of the command's overall thrust. "We're [not only trying
to put coherence into those systems that we have, but also are trying to
look at using innovation to make them maintain cutting edge so we
maintain our military edge going forward]{.underline}," Gen. Sharpy
says. "We don't want to be lagging in those, because those are the big
rocks that we are trying to move. "Even though we might not be in a
conflict, I would say that cyber is a contested domain every single
day," the general continues. "Being able to leverage the same
opportunities that cyber provides us from a good standpoint also enables
our adversaries in the negative standpoint, because they have the same
capabilities."

#### Growing threat of russia and emerging tech means NATO says yes

The Strategic Concept is among NATO's most important documents as it
informs alliance planning, resource allocation, and programming based on
changes in the threat environment. But the document has not been updated
since 2010. The 2010 Strategic Concept, entitled "Active engagement,
Modern Defense," contained just one brief sentence about cyber attacks
and did not even mention China. It also stated that "Today, the
Euro-Atlantic area is at peace," even though Russia had invaded Georgia
two years before and the threat of a return to great power competition
loomed. To argue that a lot has happened between 2010 and 2022 would be
an understatement. Russia's annexation of Crimea and intervention in the
Donbas in 2014 and the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 shattered any
illusions of a lasting peace with Russia. China's territorial ambitions,
economic assertiveness, threats against Taiwan, and military
modernization threaten the rules-based order. [Emerging
technologies]{.underline} -- in the form of hypersonic weapons,
artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and machine learning --
[have intensified great power competition]{.underline}. The 2022
Strategic Concept should highlight the essential role of technology in
collective defense. To build greater digital capacity while also
emphasizing resilience, [NATO]{.underline} [must adopt a new
technological orientation on the military strategic level of
command,]{.underline} especially within the Allied Command
Transformation (ACT) in Norfolk, Virginia and the Allied Command
Operations (ACO) in Mons, Belgium. ACT leverages advanced technologies
for security and defense in capabilities, procedures, public-private
partnerships, civil-military relations, and at NATO's Centers of
Excellence. Led by the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, ACO is
responsible for collective defense through direction, requirements,
planning, and execution at the strategic level. However, the Strategic
Concept 2022 should focus less on the emergence of new technologies and
more on how NATO's military and civilian personnel use them. ACO and ACT
**[must emphasize greater accessibility to information and
data]{.underline}** for its multinational warfighters, cyber operators,
and civilian professionals. NATO must reach out to experts in the
private sector, academia, and non-governmental organizations to harness
ways to expand access and emphasize flexibility in multi-domain
operations. NATO can do this by providing more grants to private sector
partners and establish a new center of excellence on data and
information sharing. ACO and ACT should also enable personnel and
partners to readily access data and information in DIMEL domains:
diplomatic, information/cyber, military, economic, and legal. This would
expand the range of measures needed by ACT and ACO to connect and
correlate deterrence with evolving hybrid threats. To deter hybrid
threats across multiple domains, with enhanced access on different
digital platforms, NATO members should develop smarter and lethal
capabilities to confront threats from state and non-state actors. This
would allow ACT and ACO to prepare for any contingency and respond to
adversaries in battlefields and battlespaces. Plug and Play The 2022
Strategic Concept [encourages collaboration in the implementation of
guidelines and procedures]{.underline} through a "plug-and-play"
concept, in which platforms and systems are optimized for readiness and
response at lightning speed. Plug-and-play is based on approaches used
in commercial software that allow for innovation and easy access to
networks and systems through secure platforms. The NATO School
Oberammergau should offer platform training and education courses
programs in mobile access for ACT and ACO personnel with appropriate
security clearances. This would allow them to access the appropriate
platform and utilize data and information necessary for their tasks and
responsibilities. For example, NATO's Small Arms and Light Weapons
(SALW) and Mine Action (MA) Information Sharing Platform contains rich
and publicly available datasets on the roles played by the alliance in
mitigating the illicit trade in small arms, tanks, aircraft, and naval
vessels. It reports and updates NATO-funded projects to prevent
adversaries from acquiring these weapons. However, the SALW-MA platform
is outdated and not user friendly, impeding its functionality in
practice. Put simply, NATO's ACT and ACO should focus as much on easing
access to information as it does on advanced technologies and
conventional weaponry. This would provide NATO with useful tools to
access data and intelligence on the strategic, operational, and tactical
levels and in land, sea, air, space, and cyber domains using devices and
platforms that can seamlessly connect in different locations. But NATO
Commands cannot simply expect its existing personnel to adapt. They must
be trained and educated on a regular basis to use digital
infrastructures in ways that make their jobs easier. On the strategic
level, the 2022 Strategic Concept must provide NATO's political and
military leaders with flexibility and resources to discern the diversity
of hybrid threats in the environment. NATO's strategic planners, cyber
operators, and warfighters should be trained and educated in relevant
digital platforms, access, and sharing data and information in ways that
improve collaborative decision-making and collective defense. On the
operations level, personnel must be given enough space to share data and
intelligence as well as to train tactical level personnel on software
that enables them to collect, analyze, process, and disseminate
information quickly and easily across multiple domains. Addressing these
challenges is difficult for just one nation-state, let alone for all 30
NATO members. Therefore, the 2022 Strategic Concept should emphasize
connectivity between member states in multi-domain operations and in
collaboration with the private sector and academia. Accessibility to
information and data sharing among NATO members should be securitized
and harmonized.
