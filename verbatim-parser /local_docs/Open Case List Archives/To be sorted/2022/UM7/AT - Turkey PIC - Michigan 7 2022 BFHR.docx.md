### NATO-Turkey Coop Good

#### Cooperation with Turkey [draws them into]{.underline} NATO-led initiatives

States and Europe\'s Turkey Project at Brookings, with an expertise in
Turkish foreign policy and migration studies. From 2013 until 2020, he

However, **[all is not lost]{.underline}**. [The Ukrainian crisis has
increasing questions about the wisdom of Turkey's cozy relationship with
Russia and a **greater appreciation of NATO's value**]{.underline},
[recently reiterated by]{.underline} [two prominent retired Turkish
ambassadors]{.underline}. Interestingly, their reasoning is not that
different than the Turkish diplomats and ministers of foreign affairs
from the 1940s and 1950s who played a central role in negotiating
Turkey's entry into NATO, revealing the continuity that comes with
geography but also the persistent commitment to a Western vocation
dating from Ottoman times. Moving forward, revitalizing Turkey's
traditional Western vocation and its NATO membership will be dependent
on two developments. Erdoğan is failing to address Turkey's mounting
problems. His approval ratings have dropped from almost 56% at the start
of the COVID-19 pandemic to 38.6% at the end of 2021, while the
governing AKP has also steadily lost support and was down to 23.9%.
Under these circumstances, the opposition stands a growing chance of
winning the next elections if they are reasonably free. However, the
opposition led by the social democratic People's Republican Party (CHP)
has remained by and large quiet on foreign policy issues and shied from
advocating pro-Western policies. This would need to change, and the
opposition would need to adopt an informed and rational platform that
dispels prejudices and better explains to the public why revitalizing
stronger relations with the West would benefit Turkey's interests.
**[The West needs to do its part]{.underline}** too. Foremost, [there
needs to be a recognition that there is political change in the offing
in Turkey]{.underline}. It is far from certain but there is a decent
likelihood that the next elections would be won by the opposition. In
the meantime, [it will be important for the U.S. to
recognize]{.underline} that the current crisis over Ukraine has once
more shown **[the strategic value of Turkey to NATO]{.underline}** and
develop, **[together with other allies]{.underline}**, a constructive
narrative that would welcome a post-election Turkey back into the core
of the trans-Atlantic alliance. Given the stalling out of its
enlargement process, the EU is unlikely to be able to play the robust
role it did in reforming Turkish democracy in the 2000s. But just like
70 years ago, Turkey's **[NATO]{.underline}** membership [could become a
conduit for]{.underline} mutually reinforcing [Turkey's Western vocation
and its democracy while benefiting European security]{.underline},
including that of Ukraine.

#### Incorporating Turkey into the plan ensures Turkish buy-in

[Ultimately]{.underline}, however, [fears of a Turkish realignment with
Russia are]{.underline} likely [overblown. Moscow and Ankara's relations
have]{.underline} historically [been fraught, and the recent
rapprochement stems]{.underline} more [from opportunism]{.underline}
[and coinciding interests]{.underline} than a major reorientation in
Turkish foreign policy at the expense of its traditional alliances. In
fact, [Turkey's forceful posturing is making it]{.underline} steadily
[more at odds with Russia in conflict environments]{.underline} where
both operate, including Nagorno-Karabakh, Syria, and Libya. Its growing
involvement in the Caucasus, for instance, has brought it dangerously
close to armed confrontation with NATO's primary contestant, Russia,
which supports Armenia under the Collective Security Treaty Organization
framework. This was highlighted by Russian President Vladimir Putin's
underscoring of Russia's "obligations to Armenia." Though the violence
ended there, Turkey's proxy saber-rattling contributes to increase risks
of accident or miscalculation leading to armed confrontation with Russia
--- something all parties are eager to avoid. With antagonistic security
interests at stake, [Turkey and Russia are ultimately more likely to
balance against rather than align with each other,]{.underline} though
several NATO allies continue to regard Ankara's ties to Moscow with a
deep-seated sense of suspicion. A Constructive Role for NATO [As Turkey
and the E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [ramp up their
rhetorical joust, it is]{.underline} perhaps [no surprise that **NATO is
better placed to act as a forum for the de-escalation of the crisis**.
It is]{.underline} indeed [Turkey's membership to NATO]{.underline}, and
the daily staff-to-staff contacts which it generates, [that makes the
alliance able to work as a platform where]{.underline} their [diplomats
can negotiate, exchange information, and address issues]{.underline} of
common strategic interest with European counterparts, [thus helping to
undermine the "us-versus-them" mentality]{.underline} which at times
prevails across E.U. institutions. [As the latter hardens its rhetoric,
**NATO can generate the much-needed safety valve where diplomatic
efforts have a chance of succeeding.**]{.underline} To this end, [the
alliance should capitalize on the consultative function of its
institutions to allow for parties to sit together, express their views
and concerns]{.underline} on national and collective security
considerations, [and improve mechanisms to reach a
consensus]{.underline} on the means to address any perceived challenges.
[Consultations]{.underline} have indeed always been at the core of the
alliance, and [remain important vectors for addressing intermember
disagreements]{.underline}. The [recent announcement]{.underline}
[by]{.underline} NATO Secretary General Jens [Stoltenberg that
a]{.underline} military [de-confliction mechanism would be established
between Greece and Turkey is]{.underline} but [one example of the
productive results that such diplomatic efforts]{.underline} can [yield,
and an encouraging sign that the two sides are not willing to see their
relations deteriorate further.]{.underline} Yet a limited arrangement
between Greece and Turkey is also unlikely to address the deep-seated
causes of the political turmoil between Ankara and European allies, and
[NATO should find new and improved ways to act as a forum to discuss,
and]{.underline} to [act]{.underline}, where necessary, [on issues
**affecting the security interests of its member states**. This is key
if the organization wants to remain flexible and relevant in the
increasingly contested and fast-paced security environment of
today.]{.underline}

[While the current standoff between Turkey and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [appears to be moving]{.underline} from bad [to
worse, **it has yet to reach** a breaking point or a **point of no
return.** Although tensions and policy differences continue to plague
US-Turkish relations, efforts by]{.underline} well-meaning
[policymakers]{.underline} within the US government and Turkey's
civilian and military establishment **[point to]{.underline}** perhaps
[**better days to come**, given the resilience and endurance of the
**ties that bind the two nations together**. The US perspective on
Turkey could be traced to many factors, starting with]{.underline} the
[refusal of]{.underline} the [Turkish Parliament to allow US forces to
transit Turkish territory to attack Iraq]{.underline} in 2003 and the
slow Turkish support for the US-led coalition against ISIS. [Turkey
is]{.underline} also [being put on notice by the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [for feuding against other NATO
allies]{.underline}---namely, Germany, the Netherlands, Cyprus, France,
and Greece. In the last case, tensio[ns have been brewing in recent
months over]{.underline} new [border disputes in]{.underline} the Aegean
and the refusal of [Greece]{.underline} to extradite a group of Turkish
officers allegedly involved in the failed coup. Although resolving the
Cyprus issue remains high on the US agenda, [tensions between Turkey and
Cyprus over oil and gas exploration rights and access]{.underline} off
the coast of Cyprus [are forcing the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and the European Union to side with Cyprus and even
entertain sending US naval ships to protect Cypriot gas and oil tracks
at sea. [Despite these and other policy differences]{.underline} over
Syria and other domestic problems facing Turkey, [**both sides seem
reluctant to cause irreparable damage to their alliance**. The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, which [has traditional ties
with Turkey, does not want a military confrontation]{.underline} with
the country over Syria. The most hopeful sign of addressing some of the
protracted problems currently facing US-Turkish relations stems from the
fact that [Turkey is still seen by the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [as important to America's national
security]{.underline} interests, especially [given Turkey's]{.underline}
geostrategic [location and]{.underline} cultural [familiarity with its
volatile neighbors. Turkey]{.underline} is currently self-absorbed with
its ambitions and Muslim neo-Ottoman nationalist revivalism, but its
unique ballot-box democracy, albeit imperfect by Western standards,
**[will work toward increasing harmonization toward the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and its NATO allies in
the long run. This can only happen through a sustained strategic
dialogue.]{.underline}** The idea is to keep Turkey and the United
States engaged while trying to find solutions to the issues that
separate them, because once the current tactical posturing is stripped
away, the strategic alliance becomes more visible. [There
is]{.underline} indeed current [evidence for better US-NATO-Turkish
cross-cultural communication techniques to manage and
resolve]{.underline} outstanding [policy and strategic
differences.]{.underline} In short, [**Turkey is not yet lost**, but
there are challenges]{.underline} facing America and its NATO partners
in how to bridge the growing gap between them and Turkey. This challenge
touches on a fundamental question: What kind of strategic relation- ship
do the United States, NATO, and Turkey want or desire? Clearly, [they
are at a]{.underline} policy and strategic [cross- road.]{.underline}
The answer lies in the need for the United States to craft a new
strategy toward Turkey and vice versa that takes into account the new
realities of Turkish, NATO, and American domestic political dynamics,
their changing nature and character, as well as Tur- key's quest for
regional influence and ambitions and its goal of becoming a great
regional power. **[Turkey, NATO, and the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [**share Western values, and** **these
values**,]{.underline} although not equal for all partners, **[are keys
to better multicultural harmony if applied properly]{.underline}**
across the board.

[Despite]{.underline} the [considerable]{.underline} degree of
[divergence, Ankara acts in parallel but not]{.underline} necessarily
[against the EU and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. In the
grand scheme of things, [Turkey is tightly connected to the European
economy]{.underline}, a fact highlighted by the ongoing recession, which
puts at risk EU investors too. [Turkish trade with EU
members]{.underline} Romania, Greece and Bulgaria [is]{.underline} by
far more [significant]{.underline} than with the Western Balkans, though
Serbia is picking up too. On the security side, [Turkey pursues a policy
independently of NATO]{.underline} and has deepened ties to Russia.
**[Yet, it remains part of the Alliance and contributes to its
initiatives, including those aimed to deter Moscow.]{.underline}** When
it comes to the Balkans, [Turkey]{.underline} has no alternative to
offer to local countries to woo them away from Euro- Atlantic
institutions. Its [resources are limited]{.underline}, too, [in
comparison]{.underline} [with the]{.underline} collective
[West]{.underline}. What is also important is that Balkan elites do not
necessarily see a trade-off between ties to Western organizations and to
Turkey. That is clearly visible in the policy of non-aligned Serbia,
which has also been courting Russia, China and the Gulf while
negotiating its membership in the EU. But it is also the case of
Bulgaria which has emerged as a leading advocate of engagement with
Turkey within the Union. [The only country]{.underline} in Southeast
Europe [which has deep-seated concerns]{.underline} and fears [about
Turkish expansionism is Greece,]{.underline} which has long-standing
territorial disputes with its neighbour only made worse by the looming
conflict over offshore gas deposits in the proximity of Cyprus. [But
Greek policymakers have demonstrated the capacity to be flexible and
deescalate tensions]{.underline} (Christofis in this issue). [Turkey is
embedded in the politics, economies and societies of the
Balkans]{.underline}. It is an autonomous player, and the cult of
Erdoğan has become central to its presence in the region, often with
divisive effects. [However, **there is no evidence that its actions or
policies are geared at replacing the West** as the lynchpin of regional
order. Rather, **Turkey is pursuing a parallel policy,
which**]{.underline} at times **[overlaps with that of
the]{.underline}** EU, **[US and NATO.]{.underline}**

In the recent decade, [the U.S. has pursued a strategy to
support]{.underline} armed [Kurdish groups]{.underline} to repel radical
Islamic terror groups, particularly ISIS. [Nevertheless, Turkey has
become increasingly concerned]{.underline} about the strengthening of
the Kurdish administration and its nationalist ambitions. [These
concerns are pushing Turkey into the arms of U.S. rivals]{.underline} in
the region. Both Iran and Russia are expanding their authority in the
region by establishing political and military support for radical
regimes such as Assad's in Syria and political and militant movements
like Hezbollah. These s[trategic policies are increasingly connecting
Iran's and Russia's allies in an ever-strengthening regional security
complex]{.underline}. Given these regional circumstances, [Turkey finds
itself flip-flopping between these rival regional security
complexes.]{.underline} The primary cause for current problems in
U.S.-Turkey relations is not simply the recent actions of the two
countries. The complex view of the IR system facilitates the
understanding that the [U.S.-Turkey relationship is shaped by the
feedback loops generated under]{.underline} both [regional and global
circumstances. The complexity of the international system can
trigger]{.underline} a dramatically [different evolution of relations
between U.S. and Turkey as a feedback (reaction]{.underline}) caused by
the U.S. For example, the U.S. does not hesitate to use methods like
arming the YPG, even if these methods hurt former allies such as Turkey.
As a result[, U.S.-Turkish relations continue to be vulnerable to the
U.S. approach toward]{.underline} minority, [rebel groups which have
problematic bonds with Turkey.]{.underline} The [international roles
that the U.S. and Turkey pursued]{.underline} for themselves in the
post-9/11 era have [had consequences for perceptions of]{.underline}
historical [friendship or hostilities]{.underline} -- what the Regional
Security Complex Theory ties to cooperative or non-cooperative behavior
of states. [There were hostility perceptions among Turkish]{.underline}
military and Foreign Service [chiefs in the wake of the collapse of the
Soviet Union]{.underline} when the U.S. sought to maintain its global
supremacy role. Given its resources, the [U.S. cannot help but be
superior to smaller,]{.underline} poorer [states that do not have
Washington's military capacity. The issue is the way]{.underline} in
which [the U.S. dominates]{.underline} -- that is, [its treatment of its
allies, not considering their strategic]{.underline} security
[concerns]{.underline}, etc. Turkey was deeply concerned with events in
northern Iraq following the 1991 Iraq war. These events amounted to
challenge Turkey's priority of preventing the emergence of an
independent Kurdish administration in northern Iraq. [The hostility
perceptions in Turkey turned to be reciprocal between the U.S. and
Turkey]{.underline} thanks to the feedback loops generated by the 9/11
attacks. The unilateral U.S. reaction to the 9/11 attacks during the
Bush administration undermined the U.S.-led liberal international order
and played no small role in the inauguration of Trump as a president who
questions this order and views local U.S. allies as burdens on the U.S.
[If we acknowledge that the complexity of the i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elations [system is at play]{.underline} here, the causal
logic of the [complexity approach leads us to expect that Turkey's
internal characteristics can pressure systemic
transformation]{.underline} -- something other than the predictions
generated by the regional security complex approach.83 [A U.S. that
operates with a systemic moral conscience could assist Turkey in
managing its affairs. Facing complexity **invokes improving diplomacy
and collaboration, adopting multilateral solutions**]{.underline} and
soft power **[and constructing]{.underline}** some [**advanced strategic
partnerships**. If the U.S. chooses to nurture its relationships with
allies such as Turkey, the erosion of the U.S.]{.underline} position of
[influence could be mitigated]{.underline} and the U.S. still could be
the primary actor in maintaining stability in the Middle East. The
underlying message of this paper is that [**the U.S. and Turkey are
rebuilding their alliance due to various factors.** Both **countries
could form a revised alliance as an important constituent of the
regional peace system.** Neither]{.underline} of them
[desire]{.underline}s the [continuation of the]{.underline} Syrian
[chaotic status-quo and its accompanying insecurity]{.underline} nor do
they desire Iran to dominate with a greater role in Syria or in the
Middle East. Clearly, [the security of the region is in]{.underline} a
state of greater [flux]{.underline} today than it has been in the past,
yet **[tackling the present challenges]{.underline}** in the Middle East
**[depends on the effective involvement of regional U.S.
partners.]{.underline}**

[The]{.underline} end [result of Turkey's tarnished ties with
its]{.underline} traditional [allies in the West]{.underline} and its
neighborhood(s) [have demonstrated the limits of the illusion of
Ankara's strategic autonomy.]{.underline} Indeed, despite its
aspiration, **[Turkey remains firmly anchored in the Western community
of nations.]{.underline}** In addition to being a NATO member, over 40
percent of [the country's exports are destined for EU member states
and]{.underline} another 6 percent or so each to [the UK
and]{.underline} the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. In
addition, [Turkey gets]{.underline} most of [its]{.underline} foreign
direct investment ([FDI) and tech]{.underline}nology [from Western
countries]{.underline}. EU member states account for almost 70 percent
of all incoming FDI, with another nearly 10 per- cent accounted by the
United States. Against this backdrop, the 2020 economic downturn,
compounded by a sharp drop in FDI, a negative foreign investment balance
sheet (excluding real estate), and a lowering of credit risk
scores---and, more recently, a spike in inflation and a downturn in the
value of the national currency---are to be associated with these frail
political relations. [The next phase of Turkey's foreign relations
paradigm will]{.underline} therefore [be marked **by how well the
country's growing capabilities**]{.underline}---but also its
ambitions---**[can be reframed to allow for]{.underline} a [more
cooperative foreign policy]{.underline}** pattern. [This]{.underline}
objective [will]{.underline} in turn [require three
fundamental]{.underline} [changes]{.underline}. [The first is the
decoupling of foreign policy from domestic political considerations. A
new balance will have to be found between the need for a democratic
government]{.underline} that is accountable to its electorate
[and]{.underline} the need for a more [mature]{.underline} and
predictable [foreign policy.]{.underline} This new understanding should
be instrumental in containing the proclivities of the ruling elites to
instrumentalize foreign policy for domestic goals. This objective will
be greatly facilitated by a [second]{.underline}, namely [the
reinstitutionalization of foreign policy.]{.underline} As discussed
above, [the transition back to a presidential system has led to the
erosion]{.underline} of the role [of traditional
institutions]{.underline} (e.g., ministries) in the policymaking
process---to the benefit of the presidential administration. This is
also true of foreign policy, where the role of the Foreign Ministry has
been diminished. [This]{.underline} domain [requires re- balancing,
which would reempower]{.underline} the [traditional]{.underline}
institution of [policymaking]{.underline}. Such [a rebalancing would
improve the predictability of Turkey's foreign policy]{.underline}, as
the heavier weight of the relevant institutions could more effectively
counter the tendencies fueled by exclusively domestic political
considerations. Third, [the country's foreign policy retransformation
will be more effective if Turkey's partners respond positively to
such]{.underline} an agenda of [change. The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and the EU---Turkey's strategic allies in the
domains of security, defense, and economy---[can help
Ankara]{.underline} in its bid to [develop a new understanding of how
Turkey]{.underline}, as a rising power, [can prioritize positive sum
scenarios]{.underline}. For instance, [**Washington will need to** alter
its approach and **start to engage constructively with the Turkish
leadership to tackle**]{.underline} the corrosive set of **[bilateral
problems,]{.underline}** including the ongoing U.S. relationship with
the PKK-linked Syrian PYD and the dysfunctionalities in defense industry
cooperation. At the same time, the EU will need---at the very least---to
cease its obstructionism regarding the launch of an ambitious trade
agenda and endorse the start of the negotiations for a modernized
Customs Union between Turkey and the EU. [The outcome of new
negotiations to reach a fair and lasting model of
cooperation]{.underline} on the refugee issue [will be of equal
importance.]{.underline} At bottom, [what is at stake in the next decade
is the identity of Turkish foreign policy. **A departure
from**]{.underline} what marked the past decade---[**unilateralism**
inspired by]{.underline} a strong yearning for [strategic
autonomy]{.underline}---[**is already under way**. **This change in
approach is evident in**]{.underline} the more **[recent efforts at
diplomatic rapprochement with allies and regional
partners]{.underline}**. Ultimately, [the success of this transformation
will be conditional on a clear demonstration]{.underline} of intent by
the country's leadership [that **Turkey**]{.underline}, as a rising
power, **[needs to establish a more constructive and cooperative
relationship with its main allies.]{.underline}**

### NATO-Turkey Coop Good\-\--AT Spoiler

#### Turkey isn't a [terminal]{.underline} spoiler \-\-- there are [avenues]{.underline} for cooperation \[like the plan\]

Turkey as an awkward partner

[Despite the rift between Turkey and the West, Ankara's]{.underline}
Balkan [policy is neither disruptive nor entirely beholden to
neo-imperialist fantasies]{.underline}. [Rather it reflects a mixture of
ideology and pragmatic calculations and is often a **product of
circumstances** rather than grand designs]{.underline}. To start with,
[there is **no evidence** that Erdogan or the AKP are systematically
exporting authoritarian institutions and practices abroad, undermining
the West]{.underline}. Authoritarianism in the Balkans is a home-grown
phenomenon and not an import. In the 1990s, for instance, both Serbia
and Croatia saw the emergence of strongman regimes led respectively by
Slobodan Milošević and Franjo Tudjman. Such regimes combined democratic
and authoritarian elements, e.g. competitive elections in tandem with
state capture skewing the playing field, the propagation of illiberal
ideology and the suppression of minorities. It would be far-fetched to
fault Erdoğan, Putin, Viktor Orbán or anyone else about the rule of law
and accountability deficits in a region with historical experience with
competitive politics but is still a novice when it comes to democratic
governance. External powers may take advantage of state capture and
corruption, as they often do, but these are by and large local
conditions liable to be exploited (Bechev 2017; Bieber and Tzifakis
2019). Foreign meddling could well exacerbate matters -- e.g. Turkey's
partnership with or outright patronage over certain politicians and
factions in Bosnia and Herzegovina consolidates their grip on power and
public resources -- but is not the root cause of democratic
dysfunctionality. Secondly, [Turkey is not always the lone wolf it
appears to be]{.underline}. [A 'neo-Ottoman' policy would imply that
Turkey acts mostly unilaterally instead of through]{.underline}
institutions or alliances such as [NATO]{.underline}. To be sure,
Turkish foreign policy has a strong unilateralist impulse, as many
scholars and experts have pointed out. Self-reliance and distrust of
foreigners are entrenched in the Turkish public's perceptions and
attitudes (Aydın 2019). Ankara has made moves and asserted its interests
in the Balkans, such as providing economic assistance through TİKA),
supporting domestic political players aligned with the AKP, funding
schools, trying to mediate in regional disputes etc. The same was very
much true of the Middle East before the Arab Spring when Davutoğlu was
touting the notion of Turkey as an order-setter (düzen kurucu ülke)
(Davutoğlu 2001). At the same time, [even with President Erdoğan in
complete control and nationalism rampant, foreign policy has **played
along and adapted to multilateral institutions**]{.underline}. To give
the obvious example, despite its strained relationship with NATO and the
EU, Ankara continues to support their enlargement to the Balkans, as in
the AKP's early years of power. Rather than pursue an obstructionist
strategy, as does Russia, and try to wean countries into its diplomatic
orbit, it ratified without delay Montenegro and North Macedonia's NATO
accession treaty. There is no rhetorical or substantive opposition from
Ankara vis-à-vis the EU's expansion (Daily Sabah 2020). That makes sense
from a purely rational perspective. Bringing new members also means
expanded market access for Turkey thanks to the Customs Union with the
EU. Notably, Turkey is amongst the top five export markets for Romania,
Bulgaria and Greece, all members of the Union.7 In short, there still
remains a multilateral dimension to Turkey's engagement with the
Balkans, even if it gets overshadowed by Erdoğan's leader-to-leader
diplomacy (Büyük and Öztürk 2019). To sum up, despite the overarching
trends towards de-Europeanization affecting both Turkey and the Balkans,
there remains institutional ties and economic ties that bind them both
in the Western sphere. [This creates **space for Turkey and Western
actors** to join forces]{.underline} in the region [on an **ad hoc
basis**]{.underline}.

**[Turkey]{.underline}** is embedded in the politics, economies and
societies of the Balkans. It is an autonomous player, and the cult of
Erdoğan has become central to its presence in the region, often with
divisive effects. However, [there **is no evidence** that its actions or
policies are geared at replacing the West as the lynchpin of regional
order]{.underline}. [Rather, Turkey is pursuing a **parallel policy**,
which at times overlaps with that of the EU, US and NATO]{.underline}.

### NATO-Turkey Coop Good\-\--AT S-400's

#### Turkey only bought S-400s from russia because there was no US agreement on modalities

https://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/commentary/turkey-and-nato-resolving-the-s-400-spat/)//mcu

Bashing Turkey in international fora has become fashionable. [Some
suggest that Turkey is no longer a reliable]{.underline} or trustworthy
[member of NATO]{.underline}. Some go further, claiming that Turkey is a
liability, ignoring its history as a staunch ally. As former Turkish
Ambassadors to NATO, we believe that a healthy dose of reality should be
injected into this debate, which risks descending into a blame game in
which only NATO's opponents stand to gain. For the good of NATO and
Turkey we offer some constructive proposals and perspectives to restore
a sense of balance. First, we should seek to understand and resolve the
one issue overshadowing all else, the [Turkish purchase of Russian made
S-400 air defence systems]{.underline} and the U.S. decision to both
disengage Turkey from the F35 programme and to place some sanctions on
it. It should be remembered that [Turkey wanted to buy US air defence
systems but there was no agreement on the modalities]{.underline}.
Nevertheless, [this impasse in]{.underline} bilateral [relations between
Turkey and the U.S]{.underline}., and therefore within the Alliance,
[must and can be overcome with a modicum of give-and-take on both
sides]{.underline}. In our opinion, the issue of the Russian-made S-400s
could be satisfactorily resolved if Turkey makes a verifiable pledge
within NATO not to activate the system and the U.S. takes a decision in
parallel to reverse its position on the exclusion of Turkey from the F35
programme and on the recently imposed sanctions. Such conciliatory moves
should be complemented by a decision, backed by Alliance solidarity, to
enable Turkey to reach a deal on the joint production of a missile
defence system under a generous technology sharing agreement. We firmly
believe that such a compromise is achievable.

### NATO-Turkey Coop Good\-\--AT Russia

Ultimately, however, [fears of a **Turkish realignment** with Russia are
likely **overblown**. Moscow and Ankara's relations have
**historically** been **fraught**, and the recent rapprochement stems
more from **opportunism** and **coinciding interests** than a major
**reorientation** in Turkish foreign policy at the **expense** of its
**traditional alliances**]{.underline}. In fact, [Turkey's **forceful

**[Russia]{.underline}**, which supports Armenia under the Collective

President Vladimir Putin's underscoring of Russia's "obligations to
Armenia." Though the violence ended there, Turkey's proxy saber-rattling
contributes to increase risks of accident or miscalculation leading to
armed confrontation with Russia --- something all parties are eager to
avoid. [With **antagonistic** security interests at stake, Turkey and
Russia are ultimately more likely to **balance** against **rather than

What does Turkey expect from its cooperation with Russia? First and
foremost, it has a bargaining chip to be used against its Western
partners. This type of flirtation threatens the alliance and forces the
NATO powers to support Turkey's agenda in Syria. However, [Turkey is
**aware** that **Russia** is an **unreliable partner** and that in the
**long-run** it is **no benefit** to be **outside NATO**]{.underline}.
That is why, for instance, [Ministry of Foreign Affairs declarations
**continue** to **stress** Turkey's **place in NATO** and why Turkey
**continues to support** its NATO allies' air strikes against Damascus.

In terms of alliance dependence, [Turkey would not put the **peace** and
**deterrence** provided by NATO at risk in a **volatile neighborhood**.
This approach includes **Russia-originated** threats]{.underline}.
Despite conjunctural cooperation between Turkey and Russia, the [chances
for a new strategic axis centered on the two countries is
**improbable**]{.underline}. Rather, [NATO is an **important asset** for
Turkey, even in **developing** its **relations** with Russia, as
membership **eases** the threat of **domination** by
Moscow]{.underline}. As a NATO member, [Turkey can rely on
**deterrence** that **discourages** regional adversaries from engaging
in a **full-scale** military campaign **against Turkey**.]{.underline}
This deterrence is no less important than having particular weapons,
such as S-400s. [NATO also supports **inter-alliance peace** between
Turkey and Greece, thereby sustaining a **delicate balance** to prevent
the Aegean dispute from turning into a **military
confrontation**]{.underline}. Turkey has a long-term policy of
participating in the international organizations that Greece joins in
order to maintain parity. [Leaving]{.underline} the most crucial one --
[NATO -- would put Turkey in the **difficult position** of confronting
the alliance **alone**]{.underline}. Lastly, [Turkey would not want to
give up the NATO **nuclear umbrella**, given that some of its neighbors
**possess** (Russia) or are striving for the capability of
**developing** (Iran) **nuclear weapons**.]{.underline}

#### Turkey won't leave

**Synergia** Foundation **19** (NATO AND TURKEY: AN IMMINENT DIVORCE?,
https://www.synergiafoundation.org/insights/analyses-assessments/nato-and-turkey-imminent-divorce)

Stung by the continued rejection of its EU membership on grounds of its
"poor human rights record", the authoritarian Erdogan just does not have
the incentive to toe NATO line.

Suspension of GSP benefits and increasing pressure from the Senate to
impose sanctions on Turkey under the Countering America's Adversaries
Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) will only widen the gap between Turkey
and NATO.

However, [Turkey is **unlikely to unilaterally opt out** of the alliance
because the alliance does have many benefits apart from the prestige of
being a member of NATO]{.underline}.

Hardening of the Turkish stand will impinge on conflict resolution in
Syria where Turkish national goals are at a tangent to Western plans.
Here, Turkey may leverage Russia to checkmate US and its allies.

#### Turkey won't leave NATO or respond to the plan

MOSCOW, May 30. /TASS/. [[Turkey]{.mark} will continue to pursue an
independent military policy, **but [will]{.mark} [refrain from
\"challenging]{.mark}\" the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [or
quitting]{.mark} the [North Atlantic alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline},
the head of the Russian International Affairs Council, Andrey Kortunov,
told TASS on Monday. \"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, while
being a full-fledged member of the North Atlantic Alliance, pursues an
independent, externally unrestrained military policy. The way I see it,
he will continue like this this further on,\" Kortunov said.
[Erdogan]{.underline} \"firmly defends his interests, for he **[is well
aware that [Turkey will not be expelled from NATO]{.mark}, while [he
will not leave on his own]{.mark},\"]{.underline}** the analyst said. At
the same time, Kortunov predicts Ankara's conflicts with NATO. \"There
will be harsh statements and threats from both sides, **[but I don\'t
think it will come to Turkey\'s withdrawal or [expulsion from
NATO]{.mark}. It [would cost both sides too
much.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}** Turkey's interests **[[Without
Turkey]{.mark}, Kortunov explained, \"[NATO\'s southern flank will
lose]{.mark} a lot, if not [everything]{.mark},\"]{.underline}**
**[since [the country is the bloc's leading
member]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and its armed forces are inferior only to
those of the US.]{.underline} For this reason, he continued, [the
Turkish leadership will]{.underline} be pressing for concessions from
the US and EU countries, \"but it will [never challenge
them]{.underline}.\" Erdogan has a whole list of complaints against the
United States, Kortunov recalled. For instance, Turkey wants the lifting
sanctions related to its purchase of Russia's S-400 air defense systems
and its return to the US F-35 fighter program. \"There is as great deal
to bargain about. Clearly, Erdogan will not get everything, but he will
be able to get something in the end,\" he believes. The expert also
suggested that the Turkish side might be able to defend its interests on
the issue of Finland and Sweden joining NATO. For one, the Turkish
leadership wants these countries to curtail their traditional support
for the Kurdish opposition. \"I think they will eventually come to an
agreement. Here, concessions are expected not only from Stockholm, but
also from Brussels,\" Kortunov explained. While commenting on the
Turkish leader\'s contacts with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the
expert noted: \"In the alliance, no one would want Erdogan to play his
own game with Moscow behind its back. But it be impossible to prevent
it, so they will have to leave everything as it is.\" The analyst
stressed that Turkey had long had a very special relationship with the
North Atlantic Alliance and declared certain interests that often do not
coincide with the stance of other NATO members. The Turkish leadership,
Kortunov forecasts, will continue to pursue a policy that, in a sense,
might violate the unity of the bloc. \"However, in this regard, [Erdogan
will go as far as he will be allowed to,\"]{.underline} he stressed.
\"He will be declaring his special interests in Libya or the Eastern
Mediterranean, he will put himself in opposition to some European
countries, or position himself as a global advocate of Islam, but **[[I
don\'t think he will go to extremes]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}**

### Expulsion Bad\-\--L-List

#### Turkish inclusion into NATO solves [Russia]{.underline}, [Middle Eastern]{.underline} and [Caucasus]{.underline} war

**Hess 6-22**-2022, Central Asia fellow at the Foreign Policy Research
Institute (Maximillian, "Why the West Should Make Peace With Erdogan
Now: He is the one unsavory character the West urgently needs better
relations with.," Foreign Policy,

[The democratic West has a long and controversial history of entering
alliances of convenience with dictators and strongmen around the
world]{.underline}---unsavory but necessary partners in confronting
threats to the international order. Denounced as ethically dubious, this
sort of stance is also realist, balance-of-power politics par
excellence. It enabled the world to unite to defeat Adolf Hitler in
World War II and the West to win the Cold War. [Atop the list of
unsavory partners the West urgently **needs better relations with**
today sits]{.underline} Turkish President Recep Tayyip
[Erdogan]{.underline}. That he is unsavory is clear: He has actively
undermined Turkish democracy, undone decades of liberalization,
weaponized migration, terrorized the Kurdish minority both at home and
in neighboring Syria, and helped Iran violate U.S. sanctions. Most
recently, he has threatened to block NATO membership for Sweden and
Finland. It will take a long time before the West can genuinely trust
him. However, the reality is that [the West needs Erdogan more than
ever]{.underline}. [Russia's brutal, all-out war against Ukraine has
vastly raised Turkey's profile on the geostrategic
chessboard]{.underline}. [Ankara has emerged as a key supplier of drones
to Kyiv]{.underline}---shipments it has luckily shown no intention of
halting. Ukraine's chances of victory would be significantly improved if
Turkish arms deliveries were expanded. [Erdogan, who controls access to
the Black Sea through the Turkish Straits, crucially shut the passage to
warships in late February]{.underline}. At the same time, Ankara has
also been willing to cooperate with Moscow on Ukraine where Erdogan sees
an opportunity. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu discussed
plans to secure a route for Ukrainian grain exports with his Russian
counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in Ankara on June 8, reportedly asking for a
25 percent discount on Turkish grain purchases as part of the deal.
Without Ankara on board, any Western proposals to break the Russian
blockade of Ukrainian ports are dead on arrival. [The West also needs
Turkey on its side in the economic war against Russia]{.underline}.
[Ankara's support alone can restrict the flow of sanctioned Russian
goods in and out of the Black Sea, which continue even as Ukrainian
ships are stuck in port]{.underline}. [Ankara's help is crucial in
cutting ratlines for Russian money and kleptocrats]{.underline}. Turkey
has become a major destination for Russian money (and oligarchs' yachts)
fleeing sanctions and plays a growing role in supporting Russian
President Vladimir Putin's new autarkic economy. Turkey is one of the
few major countries that freely accept Russian payment, undercutting the
impact of Western banking sanctions. Bringing Turkey onboard would plug
one of the largest holes in the sanctions regime. Russia's brutal,
all-out war against Ukraine has vastly raised Turkey's profile on the
geostrategic chessboard. But most importantly, [Turkey will be a key
player in the reordering of European energy supplies]{.underline}, not
least because it controls energy access through a number of crucial
pipelines. The key to Europe's Southern Gas Corridor strategy, for
example, is gas from Azerbaijan supplied via Turkey's Trans-Anatolian
and Trans-Adriatic pipelines---inaugurated in 2018 and 2020,
respectively---and feeding into the European gas grid in the Balkans and
Italy. Erdogan is also actively seeking to develop Turkey's own gas
resources and potentially even link Israeli and Cypriot offshore gas
fields to the European pipeline network. Such efforts are of course
complicated by Greco-Turkish disputes over Cyprus and its surrounding
waters. A revived European-Turkish partnership may be the only way the
Eastern Mediterranean's rich energy resources can be fully utilized.
Such a partnership might also nudge Erdogan to make an about-face
vis-à-vis Russia, where the inauguration of the TurkStream pipeline in
2020 signaled a new high point in Turkish-Russian relations. Finally,
[aligning with Erdogan would offer the West more geostrategic leverage
over the Kremlin beyond the war in Ukraine]{.underline}. [Turkey is also
a key player in]{.underline} three additional conflicts where Russia is
involved: **[Syria]{.underline}**, **[Libya]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan over
**[Nagorno-Karabakh]{.underline}**. Erdogan moved from a policy of
benign neglect to active intervention in these conflicts over the past
decade, motivated by a desire to boost Turkey's role as a regional power
independent of the West. A resumed partnership with Erdogan offers
further pressure points in the effort to constrain Moscow's global
influence. For Erdogan's drift away from the West and closer relations
with Moscow to be reversed, it is important to understand what motivated
it. Today, the West is paying a price for failing to listen to his
concerns. The drift initially began in 2011, as the Arab Spring swept
across North Africa and the Middle East. Erdogan was ebullient, as the
uprisings offered the prospect of bringing Islamists similar to himself
to power across the region. He felt betrayed when then-U.S. President
Barack Obama failed to uphold his redlines in Syria and abandoned
then-Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, affiliated with the Muslim
Brotherhood and publicly backed by Erdogan, when the Egyptian military
ousted Morsi in a coup. "Turkey has learned the hard way that the U.S.
is unwilling to invest in the region," Muhammet Kocak, an international
relations specialist based in Ankara, told me. Similarly, "Turkey's
security concerns have not been perceived as a particularly relevant
issue in the NATO agenda," said Elizabete Aunina, a doctoral researcher
at the University of Amsterdam focused on Turkish security policy. But
what accelerated Erdogan's drift away from the West---and shift to
Moscow---was his sense of betrayal after the 2016 failed Turkish coup,
which he publicly accused the United States of fostering. He also felt
abandoned by his NATO allies when Washington withdrew its Patriot
missile defense systems from Turkey and when NATO barely even reacted
after Turkey shot down a Russian fighter aircraft intruding on its
airspace, the first such incident involving NATO and Russian or Soviet
airpower in 60 years. Since then, Erdogan felt that Moscow offered a
better route to improving his regional and domestic position.
Turkish-Russian cooperation since then includes the TurkStream pipeline,
plans for Russia to build a \$20 billion nuclear power plant in Turkey,
and the 2017 announcement that Ankara would buy Moscow's S-400 missile
defense system. And although Turkey and Russia have occasionally
sparred---they back differing sides in the Syrian and Libyan civil wars,
for example---relations have remained broadly warm and manageable. That
only increases the potential strategic leverage the West would gain if
it reversed Erdogan's orientation. What carrot could the West offer
Erdogan for abandoning Moscow? Turkey's economic crisis may be just the
opportunity. With annual inflation reaching 73.5 percent in May,
currency reserves near all-time lows, and the Turkish lira down by 30
percent versus the dollar year-to-date following a 44 percent drop in
2021, Turkey's risk of default has spiked. Foreign investors have fled
the market. Desperately searching for fresh foreign capital, Erdogan
even patched up relations with his key regional rival, Saudi Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It would be better for the West to offer
Erdogan an economic lifeline than to allow Moscow to do so. The U.S.
Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, for example, should consider
offering Erdogan a currency swap line, a stabilizing instrument they
have significantly expanded in recent decades. Access to dollars and
euros could alleviate many of Ankara's mounting economic challenges and
set the stage for a more cooperative partnership. Erdogan knows he has a
strong hand and is likely to make other demands. He has already exerted
his leverage over Sweden's and Finland's desired accession to NATO,
linking it to a freer hand for Turkey against the Syrian Kurds, who have
been the West's valiant allies in the fight against the Islamic State.
Earlier this month, Erdogan announced plans for a new operation
targeting them. He may well make demands about other regional interests,
and he will certainly seek to blunt Western criticism of his domestic
governance. These concessions could prove costly to other Western
interests. There is clear hesitancy to engage Erdogan at the moment. The
West's strategy appears to be to "count on the possibility Erdogan will
lose the \[June 2023\] elections," according to Kocak. Counting on
Erdogan to allow a free and fair election and a potential peaceful
transfer of power a year from now is idealistic at best and hopelessly
naive at worst. [Erdogan is an unsavory character and will likely remain
one. But it is in the West's interest that he be on its side---not
Russia's---in order to **weaken Putin** and **ensure Ukraine's
survival**]{.underline}. The opportunity is there, and it would be
unwise of the West not to try.

### Expulsion Bad\-\--Turkish Aggression

#### Turkey expulsion collapse [Black Sea deterrence]{.underline}, sparks [Greece-Turkey]{.underline} war, and creates a [European]{.underline} refugee crisis.

Some analysts evaluate Turkey as among the most militarily powerful
nations, ranking ninth among 137 military powers worldwide.

Do we really want to [kick Turkey out of NATO and have its **military
power** and **strategic geography** aligned with Russia]{.underline}?

Geographically, [Turkey occupies]{.underline} some of the
[most]{.underline} strategically [important **territory** in the
wor]{.underline}ld. [It is the **only NATO member** state in the Middle
East]{.underline}, [bordering **Syria** and **Iraq**]{.underline}, [near
Lebanon and **Israel**]{.underline}, a region that has been --- and
continues to be --- the crucial crossroads of empire and history since
biblical times. [Turkey controls]{.underline} the [Bosporus Straits,
Marmara Sea and Dardanelles Straits between]{.underline} the [**Black
Sea** and]{.underline} the [Mediterranean]{.underline},
[giving]{.underline} it the [capability to contain **Russia's** powerful
**Black Sea Fleet**]{.underline}. [Turkey's geographic location and
strong military makes it]{.underline} the [**anchor** of NATO's
**southern flank** against **Russian aggression**]{.underline}.

Turkey also is an unsinkable aircraft carrier, with 98 airports capable
of supporting NATO air operations over the Middle East, Black Sea and
the Balkans.

It is [one of only five NATO states]{.underline} (the others being
Germany, Italy, Belgium and The Netherlands) [storing U.S. **tactical
nuclear weapons**]{.underline} on its territory. Some 50 B-61 nuclear
bombs are bunkered at Incirlik Air Force Base, controlled by U.S.
personnel stationed there.

Washington's foreign policy elites are so fixated on recent Kurdish
contributions to defeating the Islamic State (ISIS) that they seem to
have forgotten Turkey's much longer record as an ally of the U.S. and
NATO:

- Turkey fought alongside the U.S. during the Korean War (1950-1953).

- During the early Cold War, Turkey agreed to basing U.S. nuclear
  bombers and IRBMs on its territory, making Turkey a nuclear target for
  the USSR. (President Kennedy was able to avoid nuclear war with the
  Soviet Union and resolve the October 1962 Cuban missile crisis by
  secretly promising Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to remove the U.S.
  IRBMs.)

- Turkey joined the U.S. and NATO in bombing Bosnia during Operation
  Deliberate Force (1995).

- Turkey joined the U.S. and NATO in bombing Serbia during Operation
  Allied Force (1999).

- Turkey participated in Baltic Sea air patrols demonstrating support
  for the NATO Baltic states (2006).

- For years and continuing today, Turkish forces have participated in
  NATO peacekeeping in Bosnia and Kosovo.

- Turkey provided military and intelligence support to U.S. operations
  that destroyed the ISIS terrorist "caliphate."

[Turkey's **membership**]{.underline} in NATO [quelled]{.underline} the
[**long cycle of conflicts** and wars with Greece]{.underline}, [also a
**NATO member**]{.underline}. Significantly, even Turkey's controversial
invasion of Cyprus in 1974 did not trigger a war with Greece, in no
small part because both are NATO members.

Unfortunately, Turkey under President Erdogan is abandoning secularism
and democratic norms, becoming an Islamist authoritarian state, and
pulling away from the U.S. and NATO. Indeed, Erdogan is beginning to
align Turkey with Russia, buying Russian military equipment over U.S.
objections.

Erdogan even has threatened to develop nuclear weapons, which justifies
withdrawing U.S. tactical nuclear weapons from Turkey. Yet Turkey,
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel and other Middle East allies all have
legitimate fear of Iran developing nuclear missiles, so threatened
nuclear proliferation by Turkey and others may be a sign of U.S. failure
to uphold its alliance obligations through credible extended nuclear
deterrence and other means.

[Turkey controls]{.underline} the [**flow** of Middle Eastern
**refugees** into European NATO]{.underline}, a [**crucial role**
whereby]{.underline} a [friendly Turkey can]{.underline} help
[**stabilize** its neighbors]{.underline} --- [or]{.underline} an
[unfriendly Turkey could unleash]{.underline} a [**human flood** into
Europe]{.underline}.

Israel, too, will be better served if Turkey remains in NATO and, thus,
a moderating influence on Islamist Erdogan, who eventually may be
replaced by a secular leader. Imagine the threat to U.S. and Israeli
interests if Turkey leaves NATO and becomes another Islamist rogue state
like Iran.

Turkey's withdrawal from NATO may, or may not, be historically
inevitable. But the United States should do everything possible to keep
such a valuable ally in NATO and prevent Turkey from becoming a
dangerous foe.

Just as Turkey derives immense benefits from NATO membership, the
alliance in general and the United States in particular also benefit
from Turkey\'s membership. First, since its entry to the alliance
[Turkey]{.underline} has [playe]{.underline}d [a key role in European
security by shielding the continent from the east and the south. Turkey
does not only act as a buffer zone]{.underline} insulating the Kantian
Europe from the Hobbesian Middle East [but also as a spearhead enabling
NATO allies to reach out to the Caucasus, Black Sea, Central Asia and
wider Middle East]{.underline}. During the Cold War Turkey acted as a
bulwark against Soviet penetration into the wider Middle East and helped
lessen the Soviet military pressure on central Europe by tying up
sizable Soviet troops. [Turkey\'s role as an unsinkable aircraft carrier
has been well noted.]{.underline} Second, [Turkey is the only ally
within NATO which has a Muslim-majority population.]{.underline}
Turkey\'s [membership serves as an antidote to the claims that NATO is
an alliance of Christian nations.]{.underline} This has
[become]{.underline} more and more [important in the
post-9/11]{.underline} era, as civilizational and identity-related
considerations have increasingly colored international politics. [For
NATO\'s military operations across the globe not to be seen as biased
against Islamic nations, Turkey\'s presence inside]{.underline} the
alliance [has been vital]{.underline}ly important. Third,
[if]{.underline} the [Biden]{.underline} administration [is sincere
about revitalizing the]{.underline} rules-based [international order and
committed to strengthening NATO]{.underline} as a bulwark [against
Russia and China]{.underline}, securing [Turkey's cooperation within
NATO would be decisive]{.underline}. Turkey is too important an ally to
lose to the Russian-Chinese axis. Fourth, as NATO\'s current Secretary
General has underlined many times, [Turkey\'s cooperation within NATO
has been vital to the defeat of radical religious terrorism in the wider
Middle East]{.underline}. Besides, [Turkey is home to millions of
refugees]{.underline} who would like to otherwise go to European
countries. Fifth, having [the second largest army within the alliance
and participated in almost all NATO military operations to date, Turkey
has decisively contributed to NATO\'s overall military
capabilities.]{.underline} Turkey\'s [participation in]{.underline}
multinational NATO operations in [Afghanistan]{.underline} and taking
command of it numerous times [speak volumes]{.underline} in this regard.
[Turkey hosting the upcoming negotiations between the Afghan government
and Taliban could potentially facilitate the peace process]{.underline}.
Sixth, [Turkey\'s membership]{.underline} in NATO [provides western
countries with]{.underline} important opportunities to have an
[influence on Turkey\'s international]{.underline} [and internal
policies/orientation]{.underline} as well. Why to lose this prerogative
by pushing Turkey further away from the alliance? All in all, both
Turkey and NATO allies gain from Turkey's membership. Unless NATO turns
out to become an ideological weapon at the hands of the liberal hawkish
cabals in the West, Turkey would feel quite comfortable within the
alliance.

While [NATO may ultimately be able to expel Turkey, it would not be in
NATO's best interest]{.underline} to do so. First, the [[expulsion of
Turkey]{.mark} could [lead to increased antagonism between Turkey and
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Second, [the loss of Turkey's
military contributions would be a significant loss to the
alliance.]{.underline} Turkey's 1974 invasion of Cyprus placed it in
conflict with fellow NATO member Greece.\[23\] While NATO membership did
not prevent the conflict, in part because Cyprus was not a member of
NATO, Cyprus has maintained an uneasy peace since the invasion, managing
to accede to the European Union in May of 2004.\[24\] [An unaligned
Turkey may be more likely to disrupt the peace in Cyprus,]{.underline}
which is not a NATO member and may not be defended by the international
community. The preserved peace in Cyprus, and the value of the NATO
forum for preserving that peace, may be instructive for influencing
potential future actions by Turkey. While [the results of Turkey's
incursion into Kurdish]{.underline} controlled parts of [Syria
are]{.underline} currently [unknown, [NATO is more likely to influence
Turkey as a member than a non-member]{.mark} potentially [allied with
Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline} Additionally, [a loss of Turkey's military
contributions to NATO would significantly weaken the
alliance]{.underline}. [Turkey's [Incirlik]{.mark} Air [Base serves a
critical role]{.mark} in NATO operations]{.underline}. At the peak of
the fighting, missions from the base dropped an average of 180 bombs per
day.\[25\] [[Turkey is the geographically nearest]{.mark} member [to
Syria]{.mark} and [Russia]{.mark}, as well as the conflicts in [Iraq and
Afghanistan]{.mark}]{.underline}[,\[]{.mark}26\] [and a loss of the base
would hamper NATO operations in the region]{.underline}. NATO has
invested over \$5,000,000,000 on infrastructure in Turkey.\[27\] The
importance of Incirlik Air Base to NATO was affirmed by the inclusion of
\$48,000,000 for its improvement in the National Defense Authorization
Act for the fiscal year 2018.\[28\] In addition to its strategically
vital location, Turkey's military contributions to the alliance would be
missed. [[Turkey has the second-largest military]{.mark} in NATO, larger
than the third and fourth largest militaries
combined]{.underline},\[29\] [as well as the seventh-highest defense
expenditures]{.underline}.\[30\] [Turkey has been part of the NATO
mission in Afghanistan since 2001 and may have advantages in peace
brokering due to shared Islamic religion]{.underline}.\[31\] [[There are
clear benefits to maintaining Turkey's membership]{.mark} and this
course of action has advocates]{.underline}.\[32\] However, the question
of membership may not matter. The United States is considering removing
nuclear weapons from Turkey .\[33\] This would signal that NATO does not
trust Turkey, making it a member in name only, and one unaligned with
the rest of NATO, making the question of membership strategically
irrelevant.

#### Nukes in İncirlik are key to NATO nuclear defense

İncirlik's place on NATO's nuclear deterrence In other words, when Biden
was entering the presidential run of 2020, he started out stating his
discomfort regarding the nuclear weapons in Turkey. The person who has
expressed such worry is currently sitting at the White House. Can these
statements of Biden reflect on the policies he will follow during his
presidency? Let's try to answer this question by examining the moves
Biden has made on foreign policy. Biden sees strengthening transatlantic
ties, that is, relations between the U.S. and Europe, and institutional
cooperation structures as one of his primary foreign policy goals. In
this context, NATO appears as the most strategic institution for the
U.S. president. [His strategy against Russia]{.underline}, which NATO
continues to see as the main threat[, is to protect nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}, as reflected in all relevant documents of the
alliance. In this context, we can remember the decisions of the NATO
summit in Brussels in 2018. According to these, [NATO's nuclear
deterrence is based on "the nuclear weapons deployed by the U.S. in the
allied countries in Europe and the capabilities and infrastructure
provided by the relevant allied countries]{.underline}" - as well as the
contributions of the U.S. strategic forces and the U.K. and France. [One
of the "relevant allied countries" is Turkey]{.underline}. Without a
doubt, [İncirlik has a very essential place in the infrastructure
provided to the U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe.]{.underline} By allowing
the possession of U.S. nuclear weapons in İncirlik and becoming the host
to these weapons, [Turkey has assumed a significant role in NATO's
nuclear deterrence.]{.underline} In this respect[, İncirlik forms one of
the most critical pillars of NATO's nuclear umbrella under current
conditions.]{.underline} Of course, [the proximity of this base to not
only Russia but also to the Middle East is undoubtedly a factor that
needs to be taken into account.]{.underline} Biden will continue the old
policy but... Given that [İncirlik is so heavily integrated into NATO's
nuclear planning, it seems unrealistic to expect Biden's
sentiment]{.underline} in his interview with New York Times to [be
reflected in the U.S. official policy]{.underline} - unless there arises
a major policy change. Next month, the NATO summit in Brussels, where
[Erdoğan and Biden will meet face to face for the first time in the new
period, will probably be finalized with a result that will emphasize
NATO's nuclear deterrence policy once again]{.underline}. Nevertheless,
if the Turkish-U.S. relations do not enter a period of recovery and
continue to be the scene of crises as they are today, the possibility of
further strengthening of the questioning view of the U.S. press, opinion
leaders and the U.S. public opinion regarding the nuclear inventory in
İncirlik should not be underestimated.

[maintaining the **credibility** of the commitment of alliance members

#### Regional arms racing and nuclear war

Adam **Garfinkle 18,** Founding Editor of The American Interest and a
Senior Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, "The
U.S.-Turkish Unraveling and the Arabs", American Interest, 09-03-2018,
https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/09/03/the-u-s-turkish-unraveling-and-the-arabs///SJ

Now, the [logic of the security dilemma is]{.underline} such [that
in]{.underline} the [absence of the credible U.S. provision of
**extended deterrence**]{.underline}, [Turkey would feel **pressure** to
develop its own nuclear weapons]{.underline}. [That it has not exerted
itself in that direction]{.underline}, despite its formidable
engineering and scientific capacities, [illustrates]{.underline} the
[**stability** of **Turkish trust in U.S**.
protection]{.underline}---until recently---[and]{.underline} the
[ability]{.underline} of both sides [to bracket]{.underline} the **[core
security relationship]{.underline}** away from various disagreements. As
with other nuclear-armed states, should Turkey go its own way it would
do so with no active intention of actually using such weapons, but
rather as a kind of insurance policy against diplomatic extortion at the
hands of other nuclear-armed powers.

But of course [if Turkey]{.underline}, no longer tethered to U.S.
security protection in one way or another, [developed nuclear
weapons]{.underline} for such a purpose, [other **regional states**
would]{.underline} probably [feel obliged to develop or]{.underline}
otherwise [acquire their own weapons]{.underline}, if they could, [as an
insurance policy]{.underline} against nuclear extortion by Turkey.3 They
have already practiced that way of thinking in reaction to the
possibility of an Iranian nuclear breakout, of course.

Indeed, [that]{.underline} kind of [hedging]{.underline} behavior
[is]{.underline} exactly [what]{.underline} analysts have discussed for
many years now [as the so-called **N+ danger** inherent]{.underline} in
the development of Iranian nuclear weapons. It is not just the danger
posed by Iranian nuclear weapons, bad enough as that would be, but the
[mousetrap effect of proliferation]{.underline} that [would likely drive
**other states** to want]{.underline} such an **[insurance
policy]{.underline}**: [Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Algeria, and so
on]{.underline}.

Now, some observers have argued that nuclear weapons are really not very
important after all. If the United States and the Soviet Union, as well
as China, France, and the United Kingdom, survived the Cold War without
any nuclear use, it must be because deterrence is easy and hence stable,
since all rational people know that the weapons are unusable save for
the since-become-impossible exception of a state holding a monopoly over
them. One well-known scholar, Kenneth Waltz, argued persistently that
the more nuclear the weapons the better---because they would sober
everyone up and lead to more stability and fewer wars. Happily, those
with actual government responsibility did not agree.

It is unspeakably lazy thinking to glibly superimpose the U.S.-Soviet
Cold War deterrence experience onto places like the Middle East. [It
is]{.underline}, after all, [one thing to maintain stable deterrence
when there are only two]{.underline}, or a small number of, [nuclear
powers]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} quite [another to maintain stable
deterrence when]{.underline} the [number of nuclear actors gets
**larger** and becomes]{.underline} somewhat [**open-ended** as more
states lean that way]{.underline}. Under such conditions
[it]{.underline} [becomes **much more difficult** to calculate what
a]{.underline} sufficient **[deterrent]{.underline}** is, and so efforts
to make sure of having "enough" can touch off a multilateral arms
competition in which sufficiency becomes an ever-moving target, almost
impossible to hit. At the same time [it becomes much more difficult to
imagine **crisis stability** if one or more states resort to
**launch-on-warning**]{.underline} deployment postures, which are more
likely when young arsenals are small and unprotectable against
preemptive attack.

Other important potential differences between U.S.-Soviet Cold War
deterrence and potential multiparty deterrence in the Middle East exist,
too. Let us note just three.

First, [U.S. and Soviet arsenals displayed clear lines of civil-military
authority]{.underline} in highly institutionalized state systems, but
many [Middle Eastern countries lack]{.underline} both such [**clear
lines of authority** and]{.underline} highly [**institutionalized**
arrangements]{.underline}, being instead looser and more personalized by
nature.

Second, it was taken for granted that both [U.S. and Soviet]{.underline}
leaderships [cared about]{.underline} the [safety of their
populations]{.underline}, a necessary assumption for effective
deterrence. But [in]{.underline} some heterogeneous and [authoritarian
Middle Eastern countries]{.underline} this [premise may not]{.underline}
so surely [apply]{.underline}---think both Iraq and Syria under
minoritarian (and coincidentally Ba'athi) leadership, both of which
committed mass murder against its own citizens.

And third, [U.S.-Soviet deterrence]{.underline} operations
[became]{.underline} inextricably [bound up]{.underline} in the minds of
observers [with intercontinental ballistic missile]{.underline} delivery
systems. The result is that some people today think that if missiles can
be limited in one way or another, then the dangers of nuclear weapons,
even if they come to exist, would be much mitigated. This is delusional
because it is technologically obtuse. You need intercontinental
ballistic missiles if you're trying to shoot a warhead across an ocean.
But [if your enemy target is not across an ocean]{.underline}, but, as
in the Middle East, quite nearby, [airplanes are immensely **less
expensive** and **more reliable** as delivery systems]{.underline}.

The basic point is that in both theory and practice, [there is little
difference between]{.underline} the [proliferation stimulating effects
of]{.underline} a [Turkish nuclear weapons **breakout** and]{.underline}
an [**Iranian** one]{.underline}. So [if]{.underline} the
[U.S.-Turkish]{.underline} strategic [partnership unravels]{.underline},
[logic]{.underline} does indeed [suggest a Turkish effort to
develop]{.underline} its **[own nuclear capabilities]{.underline}**. (Of
course, the same kinds of pressures pertain to other key countries were
they to lose, one way or another, their U.S. nuclear umbrellas,
including Germany, Japan, South Korea, and others.)

If that happens, the [Turkish government]{.underline} could probably
[develop deliverable]{.underline} nuclear **[warheads]{.underline}** at
least on its side of the ocean [within]{.underline} two to three
[years]{.underline}. [If]{.underline} the [Iranian
government]{.underline} had [thought]{.underline} for its own good
reasons [to avoid overt testing]{.underline} and breakout postures once
the nuclear deal expires by calendar or "is expired" by volition, a
[Turkish bomb would make that posture far **more difficult** to
justify]{.underline}. One could therefore imagine a situation of twinned
or near-simultaneous breakouts of Turkish and Iranian nuclear weapons
even a mere three, four, or five years from now. The [shock to the
region would be **profound**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} possibly
very **[dangerous]{.underline}**.

[[A
recent [article](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/turkey-secretly-working-nuclear-weapons-13898)]{.mark} in
the National Interest]{.underline} by Hans Rühle, former Head of the
Planning Staff in the German Ministry of Defense, [[argues that Turkey
is positioning itself similarly to Iran in]{.mark} its leveraging of
civilian nuclear power for potential [nuclear weapons breakout
capability]{.mark}]{.underline}. His argument, meant largely to justify
German spying on the NATO-ally, posits that since Turkey is developing
nuclear power plants, potentially developing its own nuclear fuel
production capacity, and does not have a provision for spent nuclear
fuel to be return to suppliers (a provision not necessary if producing
fuel domestically), it is obviously shadowing the Iranian proliferation
formula. [[These arguments are]{.mark} significantly
[flawed]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the Turkish movement into the
nuclear arena could be afforded more clarity, particularly on the heels
of a decade of efforts to corral the Iranian program, nefarious purposes
should not be assumed; nor, are they immediately apparent. Rühle argues
that the size of the nuclear industry that Turkey is planning, as well
as the amount of fuel that would be needed to supply that industry,
would provide ample material for a nuclear weapon. From a purely
technical perspective, nuclear fuel from most civilian power reactors is
not ideal for a weapons program. Turkey plans to construct four
light-water pressurized reactors. These light-water reactors make
breeding the type of plutonium necessary for nuclear weapons difficult
-- as purity is key in having a safe and reliable arsenal. Rühle
dismisses the point that the less-pure plutonium from a civilian power
reactor would not be used for military program. Rather, Ruhle argues
that regardless of plutonium purity, a state will seek to acquire any
form of nuclear material and use it for a nuclear arsenal. However, the
quality of plutonium is a critical factor in understanding and
forecasting proliferation strategies. Not all plutonium is created
equal. Having impure plutonium in a nuclear arsenal, an arsenal that a
nation would use to deter attack by other states, would be extremely
dangerous. When uranium (particularly civilian reactor-grade uranium) is
used in a power reactor, plutonium-239, the fissile material used for
the production of nuclear weapons, is created. However, other
by-products and isotopes of plutonium are also generated. The ratio of
these by-products depends on the type of fuel you start with and how
long the fuel is used in a power reactor. The longer it is in there, the
less pure the plutonium output. While Rühle dismisses this point, other
isotopes of plutonium which would be created in the civilian power
reactor would be dangerous in a nuclear arsenal, particularly Pu-240 due
to its unstable neutron flux which makes the long-term viability of the
warhead questionable. With a quicker decay rate than Pu-239, comes the
potential for spontaneously released neutrons -- which is what starts
the chain reaction to detonation. In the short-term, this is less of an
issue, but the risk of unintended detonation increases over time. For a
state that wishes to have a nuclear arsenal that will be able to deter
the use or proliferation of nuclear weapons, a stable arsenal is
critical for reliable use if necessary and for the warheads not to
detonate on your own territory. The type of reactor that is used is also
important. The reactor models that Turkey plans to build make hiding
illicit activities, such as diverting material, difficult. Reloading the
fuel in the models being sought halts reactor operations and would stop
operations for days or weeks at time. Turkey desperately needs energy.
It imports roughly [90% of its oil and natural gas, and is heavily
reliant on
coal](https://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis_includes/countries_long/Turkey/turkey.pdf).
Domestic energy production, particularly electricity, is lacking.
Expanding its energy capacity is critical to Turkey's economic
development strategy. Shuttering a nuclear reactor for weeks or months
at a time in order to extract costly fuel does not align with this
policy objective. Further, plans for a nuclear energy sector of two
dozen or so power reactors, with contracts in place already for eight,
points to a desperate need for energy, not a mask for illicit
activities. There are also significant differences in Iran and Turkey's
nuclear sectors. Iran purchased one power facility, Bushehr, from
Russia, and then justified its expansion of uranium enrichment by the
need for medical isotopes. This justification enabled Iran to enrich up
to 20% U-235, which accounts for roughly 80% of the work load to get to
weapons-grade material. In terms of breakout capacity, this strategy is
designed to conduct enrichment in the open, and then quickly escalate to
weapons-grade. Turkey, on the other hand, is justifying its nuclear
expansion for economic reasons, driven by shortages in energy.
Additionally, recent studies have found that a [lucrative market for
mining and fuel
production](https://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-T-Z/Turkey/)
could be developed in Turkey. With developing nuclear energy sectors in
number of countries (China, Vietnam, UAE, etc.), uranium ore and fuel
services will likely be in greater demand. Again, the economic
motivations appear to outweigh the security explanations. Furthermore,
the International Atomic Energy Agency would also have greater access in
Turkey than it did in Iran in the early years of the Iranian program.
Currently, Turkey is a member in good standing and a signatory to the
[Additional
Protocol](https://www.iaea.org/safeguards/safeguards-legal-framework/additional-protocol)
(AP). The current safeguards regime in Turkey, which includes the
advanced monitoring and access that comes from the AP, requires early
notification and cooperation with the IAEA as sites that deal with
nuclear energy are developed. This access is well beyond what Iran was
subjected to during the early stages of its program. As Turkey expands
into nuclear energy, be it mining and milling or energy production,
under the current safeguards regime, the IAEA would be engaged during
the planning stages and would be able to identify at the outset possible
anomalies. Turkey, in order to move into the nuclear arena, also [signed
a Cooperative Nuclear
Agreement](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CDOC-110hdoc90/html/CDOC-110hdoc90.htm),
known informally as a 123 Agreement, with the United States in 2008.
This agreement places stringent controls on the technologies that Turkey
receives from the US, or the technologies from any other state that has
a 123 Agreement with the US. With the IAEA safeguards system and other
international regimes, such as the Nuclear Suppliers Group, this
additional layer of protection would help to prohibit illicit use of
materials Finally, [[Turkey's]{.underline} **[external security
outlook]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[alliance
structure]{.underline}** [are]{.underline}]{.mark} also [**[dramatically
different]{.mark}** than that of Iran's]{.underline}. [[Scholars have

[[have [found](https://jcr.sagepub.com/content/58/3/429.abstract) that
**security guarantees significantly reduce the likelihood for
proliferation**]{.underline}]{.mark}. While Iran could be said to have
sponsor states in China and Russia, these relationships are largely
driven by economic interests and self-interested foreign policy.
Conversely, [[Turkey is a long-standing **member of**]{.mark} **the

Turkish forces are pushing into northern Syria, replacing and sometimes
even firing on the US troops retreating at Donald Trump's orders. The
question of whether Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, is really a US ally was put to US defense secretary Mark
Esper on Fox television this morning. "No, I think [Turkey]{.underline},
the arc of their [behavior]{.underline} over the past several years [has
been terrible]{.underline}," he said. Which brings up a problem: **[The
US is storing perhaps 50 air-dropped thermonuclear bombs at its Incirlik
Airbase in southern Turkey]{.underline}**, less than 100 miles from the
Syrian border where this conflict is taking place. [The nuclear
stockpile dates back to the Cold War]{.underline}, when the US sought to
keep a sufficient supply of atomic weapons deployed in Europe to deter
potential Soviet aggression. Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and
Italy also host similar arsenals, and the US trains the participating
nations in the use of the doomsday devices. Today, [these bombs remain
in place largely because of inertia, and the hope that countries like
Turkey will see the depot as sufficient reason not to develop nuclear
weapons of their own]{.underline}. It doesn't seem to be working: Last
month, Turkish president Recep Tayyip [Erdogan said he could "not
accept" efforts to prevent Turkey from developing its own atomic bombs.
But instability in Turkey and the region, along with Ankara's close
relationship with Russia, have had American strategists talking about
re-locating their weapons for years]{.underline}. (The US does not
officially discuss the arsenal, but there is no indication that the
stockpile has been removed.) A 2016 coup attempt against Erdogan saw
power to the base cut off for several days, raising questions about the
safety of the stash. More recently, [Turkey has purchased advanced air
defense technology from Russia, which has raised hackles in the US
defense community because Turkey was a partner in developing the US F-35
fighter-bomber]{.underline}. [The US Air Force canceled the partnership
over worries that Russia would be able to learn from Turkey how to
better shoot down US aircraft.]{.underline} Now, [Russia and Turkey are
coordinating military policy in northern Syria, with the US as a
bystander]{.underline}. The move to exploit a civil conflict in Syria to
gain a geopolitical advantage typify how strategists see a new era of
great power competition playing out. One reason to be worried is that
the recent shift in US strategy launched by Trump appears to have caught
the US military establishment by surprise. It's not clear how prepared
the US is to deal with the knock-on effects of the about-face, whether
it is disappointed former allies like the Kurds (paywall) or ISIS
fighters escaping from prison camps, much less the calculus of nuclear
deterrence.

of Nuclear Weapons (which still hasn't been ratified by enough states to
enter into force) in sole possession of the field.

Relations in the Department of Public Administration and Sociology at

An argument could be made that [**[even if]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [rest of the [world]{.mark}]{.underline}
somehow [[lost interest in the NPT]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited [**[S]{.underline}**t]{.mark}ates
[[would remain]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[''enforcer of last
resort'']{.underline}**]{.mark} (cf. Horovitz, 2015 for a version of
this argument). This argument is consistent with the standard account of
the success of the United States' unilateral attempts to constrain the
nuclear developments among friends and enemies alike (Gavin, 2012;
Miller, 2018). Yet [many]{.underline} of the
[[tools]{.underline}]{.mark} that the **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[would use to compel]{.mark}
[countries to give up]{.mark} their]{.underline} [nuclear [ambitions
stem from]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates' [**[unique position]{.mark}** within
the international system]{.underline}, [[where]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited [**[S]{.underline}**t]{.mark}ates
[[sits in]{.underline} **[the center]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} various [[political]{.underline}]{.mark} and
economic [[networks]{.underline}]{.mark} (cf. e.g. Winecoff, 2015).
[These [tools]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [[work]{.underline}]{.mark}
only [[as long as]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and]{.underline} its [**[allies]{.underline}**
[dominate]{.underline}]{.mark} the world (Nexon, 2018). Yet the
centrality of the United States in various networks comes under strain,
not least because the United States decided to 'weaponize' these
interdependence networks (Farrell and Newman, 2019). One only needs to
listen to the repeated calls for alternative payment channels (such as
the EU's Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges, known as INSTEX, a
channel for conducting business with Iran) and different currencies to
settle transactions to understand the phenomenon (for a recent overview,
see McDowell, 2019). And while the rising powers do not fundamentally
question the goal of nonproliferation, they are not as heavily invested
in it. Shell

#### Security commitments are key to [effective non-prolif]{.underline}\-\--sustains the NPT -- Russia cooperation is irrelevant in a world with the NPT BUT we can walk and chew gum at the same time with prolif and Russia

**Daalder 20** \[Ivo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global
Affairs, served as U.S. Ambassador to NATO from 2009 to 2013, "Can 50
Years of Minimizing Nuclear Proliferation Continue?" 3-5,

y2k\]

Imagine we are living in the year 2030. New seismic activity indicates
an underground nuclear explosion somewhere near the Arctic Circle. One
more country announces it's joining the once-exclusive club of nuclear
weapons states that has now grown to 20 nations --- more than double the
number in 2020.

The trouble started in 2023, when a group of former
**[allies]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [renounce]{.underline}d their
**[adherence]{.underline}** [to the]{.underline}
**[N]{.underline}**uclear Non**[p]{.underline}**roliferation
**[T]{.underline}**reaty [and opted to acquire]{.underline} the very
nuclear [weapons capabilities]{.underline} that they foreswore decades
earlier.

Since then, [nations **across the world**]{.underline} had
[race]{.underline}d [to **acquire the bomb**]{.underline}, and [the
global security situation]{.underline} had [become]{.underline}
increasingly **[precarious]{.underline}**. Sooner or later, [as centers
of]{.underline} [nuclear decision making **multiplied**]{.underline},
[one of those weapons]{.underline} was [**bound** to go off,
with]{.underline} [consequences]{.underline}
**[incalculable]{.underline}** [for all.]{.underline}

**[A far-fetched future]{.underline}**? [Perhaps]{.underline}. The
nonproliferation treaty entered into force 50 years ago, on March 5,
1970. At the time, only five nations --- the United States, the Soviet
Union, China, Britain and France --- were recognized as nuclear weapons
states. Just four more countries --- India, Israel, Pakistan and North
Korea --- have since acquired the bomb. And, yet, [this scenario is more
**plausible**]{.underline} now [than many may think]{.underline}.

To understand why, we need to go back to 1963, when President John F.
Kennedy warned of a "world in which 15 or 20 or 25 nations may have
these weapons." Kennedy expressed the widely held belief that further
proliferation was likely, if not inevitable. Every nation that possessed
the capability to build a bomb had done so and American officials
worried that the trend was about to accelerate.

That didn't happen. [Having stood at the brink of]{.underline} nuclear
[war during the Cuban missile crisis]{.underline} in 1962, the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [and
the]{.underline} [Soviet Union]{.underline} [**[redoubled]{.underline}**
[efforts to **stabilize**]{.underline}]{.mark} their **[[nuclear
relationship]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and prevent other states from
**crossing**]{.underline} [the nuclear]{.underline}
[threshold]{.underline}. The **[[n]{.mark}on[p]{.mark}roliferation
[t]{.mark}reaty]{.underline}** [[was]{.mark} one
[result]{.mark}]{.underline} of those efforts. Under the treaty, states
that didn't have nuclear weapons pledged not to develop or acquire them,
while those that did committed to eventual nuclear disarmament.

**[But]{.underline}** [[it wasn't]{.mark} just]{.underline} U.S.-Soviet
[[arms control]{.mark} negotiations [that turned the]{.mark}
**proliferation [tide]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the 1960s. [**[Even more
important]{.underline}** [was **Washington's
determination**]{.underline} [to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[assure]{.underline} its [[allies]{.mark} in **Europe**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[Asia]{.underline}** that [they could **rely on
America**]{.underline} for their nuclear security. [Only after they were
convinced]{.underline} that the [American]{.underline} nuclear
[guarantee was **credible**]{.underline}, [did
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline} like Germany and Japan [decide to
**[forego]{.mark}**]{.underline} a national **[[nuclear
option]{.underline}]{.mark}** and join the nonproliferation treaty.

Whenever new developments seemed to call the American guarantee into
question --- as when a new generation of Soviet medium-range missiles
were deployed in Europe in the 1970s and when North Korea expanded its
nuclear and missile programs in the 1990s and 2000s --- Washington
worked to reassure its allies that its nuclear commitment remained
strong and credible.

[In recent years]{.underline}, **[new questions]{.underline}**
[about]{.underline} the [credibility of the]{.underline} American
[nuclear guarant]{.underline}ee have [returned]{.underline}. [One reason
is the **changing strategic environment**]{.underline}. [In
Europe]{.underline}, [a more **adventurous**]{.underline} and
better-armed **[Russia]{.underline}** [no longer shies away]{.underline}
from using military force, as its invasion of Ukraine and its support
for the Assad regime in Syria have underscored. [In Asia]{.underline},
[**China**'s rapid]{.underline} [rise]{.underline} has
[expanded]{.underline} its [military reach]{.underline} throughout the
Asia-Pacific, and [**No**rth **Ko**rea]{.underline} has [emerged as a
potent foe, armed with nuclear]{.underline} [weapons]{.underline} and
long-range missiles that threaten the entire region.

Even as threats have multiplied, allied doubts about the American
commitment have grown perceptibly since Donald Trump entered the White
House expressing deep distrust of alliances. His early failure to
reconfirm NATO's Article 5 mutual defense commitment, his threat to
leave NATO if allies did not sharply increase military spending, his
insistence that Asian allies greatly increase their financial
contributions to maintain the U.S. military presence, his musings about
some allies acquiring their own nuclear capabilities --- all these have
increased uncertainty in allied capitals about whether they can still
count on the United States.

Which raises the question: [if not the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [who will **assure**
their]{.underline} **[nuclear security?]{.underline}** [So
far]{.underline}, [**[few]{.mark}** experts [argue]{.mark} that
the]{.underline} [answer lies in]{.underline} **[[a]{.mark} national
[nuclear program]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [But]{.underline}]{.mark} as
[**[worries]{.underline}** [about]{.underline}]{.mark} [America's
**[security]{.mark} [commitments]{.mark}**]{.underline} [continue to
[grow]{.mark}]{.underline}, more [[countries may **reach**]{.underline}
[that conclusion]{.underline}]{.mark}.

To forestall this danger, Washington needs to act swiftly.

First, the president needs to unconditionally reaffirm America's
fundamental commitment to the security and defense of its allies. Yes,
the allies need to do more and spend more, but it is in America's vital
interest to ensure that they are safe and secure --- and without their
own nuclear weapons.

Second, America and the other nuclear powers need to resume serious
discussions on arms control. As a first step, Washington and Moscow need
to extend the New START treaty capping their long-range nuclear forces
before it expires next year. Next, along with Britain, France and China,
they should start a serious dialogue on how to limit their nuclear
capabilities and work together to prevent further proliferation. And all
of them should halt nuclear modernization efforts while those talks
continue.

**[[For 50 years]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the
**[[n]{.underline}]{.mark}**on**[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}**roliferation
**[[t]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty [has largely [succeeded in
preventing]{.mark} **more** [countries from going nuclear]{.mark}.
**America's [security alliances]{.mark} have [played an essential
role]{.mark} in that success**]{.underline}.
[[Reaffirming]{.underline}]{.mark} those
[[alliances]{.underline}]{.mark} and committing to serious arms control
efforts [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} help [[ensure]{.mark} its
[continuation]{.mark} in **the next 50 years.**]{.underline}

### Expulsion Bad\-\--ME

#### Turkey is an essential ally in NATO key to stabilization measures in the middle east

**Pamir et al 20**\-- Ahmet Üzümcü- Former Director-General of the OPCW,
Former Permanent Representative of Turkey to NATO, Mehmet Fatih Ceylan-
Turkish Permanent Representative to NATO, 2013-2018, Ümit Pamir- Turkish

But the critics do not stop there. [There is the wider accusation of
Turkish unreliability]{.underline}. It should not be forgotten that
[Turkey has been a reliable member of NATO for the past seven
decades]{.underline}. [It contributed significantly to the Alliance's
collective defence and deterrence in the Cold War]{.underline}. By tying
up a large portion of Soviet troops in its region, it considerably
reduced the pressure on Central Europe. Ironically, the [Western
European countries were able to build their Union gradually in a secure
and stable environment ensured by NATO, with Turkey shouldering a heavy
military burden]{.underline}. [With the end of the Cold
War]{.underline}, alone among the existing allies, Turkey's security
situation worsened. [Turkey found itself]{.underline} increasingly
[exposed in a region of turmoil engulfed by]{.underline} several [armed
conflicts.]{.underline} The [new and emerging security
risks]{.underline}, including terrorism, [have impacted
Turkey]{.underline} as much, if not [more]{.underline}, [than any other
Ally]{.underline}. Turkey feels itself on a new front line. But
throughout this period, [Turkey has remained an island of stability in a
volatile region]{.underline}. Even though instability and disorder are
on our doorstep, Turkey has fulfilled all its NATO obligations and
provided security and stability rather than consuming them. [Turkey has
stood solid behind every key NATO decision. NATO invoked Article
V]{.underline} of the Treaty for the first time [following the
9/11]{.underline} terrorist [attacks]{.underline} against the U.S. Under
the Taliban, Afghanistan had become a haven for international terrorism.
As a staunch ally, **[Turkey has played a significant role in NATO's
stabilization efforts in Afghanistan.]{.underline}** [It has deployed
troops and other military assets]{.underline} in harm's way alongside
other allies and partners. **[Turkey has never deviated from the NATO
policy "in together-adjust together-out together".]{.underline}**
Moreover, [Turkey's especially close and long-standing ties with
Afghanistan has enabled the Alliance as a whole to benefit from its
knowledge, expertise and political weight in that country]{.underline}.
Moreover, [the fight against ISIS]{.underline}, a serious concern for
the whole world, wo[uld not have been so successful without Turkey's
participation and assistance.]{.underline} **[Turkey has become an
essential partner]{.underline}** in this struggle by joining the
coalition against ISIS. [It made three air bases, including Incirlik,
available for the Allies, enabling decisively effective military
operations]{.underline}. Elsewhere, in the Balkans and Iraq, **[Turkey
has contributed to NATO's stabilization efforts]{.underline}**. [In
terms of NATO's priority core task, collective defence, successive
governments in Turkey have never wavered in their commitment to the
Alliance]{.underline}. [Turkey's current contribution cannot be
overstated.]{.underline} [It]{.underline} currently [hosts]{.underline}
a range of NATO commands and and assets, essential to NATO's collective
defence, including Allied Land Command ([LANDCOM]{.underline}) in Izmir
[and]{.underline} the NATO Rapid Deployable Corps ([NRDC]{.underline})
in Istanbul. Significantly, [Turkey will be the lead nation]{.underline}
in 2021 [in command of the 'Spearhead Force']{.underline} of NATO
(VJTF). This force can be deployed at short notice to any allied country
considered under threat. We, as former Turkish Ambassadors to NATO, are
proud to confirm that our country has assumed its responsibilities
toward the Alliance in their entirety[. Turkey is one of the few allies
to fulfil its commitment to spend 2% of its GDP on defence]{.underline};
[it has the second largest army in NATO]{.underline}, [and it ranks
fourth in contributions to NATO operations and fifth in NATO
expenditures]{.underline}. In an Alliance of thirty nations, there are
inevitably [ups and downs]{.underline} in the relations between allies.
[In the past]{.underline}, these differences **[have turned out to be
circumstantial and temporary.]{.underline}** They were eventually
resolved, mostly bilaterally, but sometimes with the use of good offices
of the Secretary General or other Allies. **[There is no reason to
suppose that the current spate of disputes will not be resolved in the
same way]{.underline}**. [During the recent tension]{.underline} in the
eastern Mediterranean, the [NATO]{.underline} Secretary General, Jens
Stoltenberg, took the welcome initiative of [invit]{.underline}ing
G[reece and Turkey to agree upon deconfliction measures.]{.underline}
[The parties concerned must be engaged in a dialogue in order to achieve
an equitable solution]{.underline} in line with international law.
[Other countries should facilitate this process by encouraging
dialogue]{.underline} among two longstanding allies. To conclude, there
needs to be a solution to the impasse presented by the procurement of
Russian-made S400s and the U.S. decisions both to disengage Turkey from
the F35 program and to apply sanctions on its ally's defence procurement
agency. A compromise would unleash much positive momentum. We believe
that [Turkey will continue to observe its obligations and commitments as
a reliable member of the Alliance]{.underline}. It will continue to
support the Alliance efforts toward global peace and security. **[The
Alliance would, no doubt, be weaker without the active participation and
support of Turkey.]{.underline}**

In February 2020, after more than a year of direct negotiations, [the
U.S. government and the Taliban signed a peace agreement that set a
timeline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from
Afghanistan]{.underline}. Under the agreement, the United States pledged
to draw down U.S. troops to approximately 8,500 within 135 days and
complete a full withdrawal within fourteen months. In return, the
[Taliban pledged to prevent territory under its control from being used
by terrorist groups and enter into negotiations with the Afghan
government]{.underline}. However, [no official cease-fire was put into
place]{.underline}. After a brief reduction in violence, the Taliban
quickly resumed attacks on Afghan security forces and civilians. Direct
talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban began months after
the agreed upon start of March 2020, faced multiple delays, and
ultimately made little progress. Viol[ence across Afghanistan continued
in 2020 and 2021 as the United States increased air strikes and raids
targeting the Taliban]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [the Taliban attacked
Afghan government and Afghan security forces targets and made
territorial gains.]{.underline} [Civilian casualties across Afghanistan
have remained high]{.underline} over the past several years. The United
Nations documented a then--record high of 10,993 civilian casualties in
2018. Although 2019 saw a slight decline, civilian casualties exceeded
10,000 for the sixth year in a row and brought the total UN-documented
civilian casualties since 2009 to more than 100,000. Despite another
decline in 2020, [the first half of 2021 saw a record high number of
civilian casualties as the Taliban ramped up their military offensive
amid the withdrawal of international troops. In addition to the
Taliban's offensive, Afghanistan faces a threat from the Islamic State
in Khorasan, which has also expanded its presence in several eastern
provinces, attacked Kabul, and targeted civilians with suicide attacks.
Uncertainty surrounding the future of international assistance has
strained the Afghan economy]{.underline}. Although [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and its allies pledged in late
2020 to continue providing support to the Afghan government, they [could
reduce aid following the Taliban takeover. Such a move could compound
Afghanistan's **deteriorating economic situation.**]{.underline}
Concerns The United States has an interest in attempting to preserve the
many political, human rights, and security gains that have been achieved
in Afghanistan since 2001. [The Taliban takeover of the country could
once again turn Afghanistan into a terrorist safe]{.underline}
[haven]{.underline}, as the group is believed to maintain ties with
al-Qaeda. [The takeover also threatens to reverse advances made in
securing the rights of women]{.underline} and girls. Moreover,
**[increasing internal instability, a mass exodus of refugees, and a
growing humanitarian crisis could have regional ramifications as
neighboring countries respond]{.underline}**. In addition, [**Pakistan,

The [Turkish Armed Forces left Afghanistan]{.underline}, [but **Ankara
is poised to play key security and diplomatic roles in the
country**]{.underline}. Turkish officials announced the evacuation of
the Turkish military contingency from the Kabul Airport on August 25,
2021, despite separate discussions with the United States and the
Taliban for Turkey to continue running the Kabul International
Airport.\[1\] Top Turkish officials had argued that the Turkish forces
could continue to manage the security and operations of the airport as
they had since 2015 if the Taliban so desired.\[2\] [Ankara]{.underline}
also [pivoted to establishing relations with the Taliban]{.underline}
through the Turkish Embassy in Qatar at least as early as August 15,
when the Taliban reached Kabul, in a likely bid [to maintain and expand
the Turkish role in Afghanistan]{.underline}.\[3\] [The bulk of Turkish
forces left Afghanistan by August 27 under reported Taliban pressure,
but the Turkish Embassy is continuing its operations]{.underline} as of
September 3.\[4\] Recent statements by both the [Taliban and Ankara
indicate that Turkey is exploring ways to help run the Kabul Airport and
support the new Taliban government]{.underline}.\[5\] [Ankara and the
Taliban both believe Turkey can play a role in shaping the new
Afghanistan. Ankara will likely double down on its political and
reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan to **prove its ability to
stabilize and shape conflicts as a regional power**.]{.underline} Turkey
has provided training for Afghan security forces, political outreach to
various Turkic communities, aid and private sector investment, and
non-combatant military services. [Turkey refrained from participating in
military campaigns against the Taliban and instead took on logistical
and security duties like Kabul Airport security, intelligence sharing,
and funding and training at Afghan military schools]{.underline}.\[6\]
[Turkish officials leveraged this non-combatant history when they
offered the Taliban further "technical and security
assistance]{.underline}" in August.\[7\] Taliban spokesperson Mohammad
Naeem said that the [**Taliban wants Turkey's support** in areas ranging
from reconstruction and economy to healthcare and education]{.underline}
on August 25.\[8\] Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan views such a
Turkish role as a natural one, underlining Turkey's long-standing ties
to its fellow Muslim country with a significant Turkic population.
Ankara and the Taliban are also in talks about the future of Kabul
Airport. President Erdogan stated that the [Taliban asked Turkey to run
the operations of Kabul International Airport]{.underline} if the
Taliban provided its security instead of Turkish forces. However,
anonymous Turkish officials claimed that Turkey would only run the
airport in partnership with Qatar and only if security was provided by a
private security firm of former Turkish soldiers.\[9\] SADAT
International Defense Consultancy, known for credible reports of its
supervision and payment of Turkish-backed Syrian fighters in Libya and
Azerbaijan, is the only private Turkish security company that could
adopt such a duty.\[10\] Discussions are ongoing as of September 3 and
the Taliban's position remains unclear. Turkey's Ambitions and
Constraints Afghanistan is a theater of opportunity, but not an
existential security problem for Ankara. Afghanistan poses little direct
threat to Turkish national security, in contrast to the perceived
terrorism and internal stability threats the country is fighting in
northern Iraq and Syria. [Afghanistan's current situation presents an
opportunity for Ankara to maximize its political and]{.underline}
security reach by filling growing gaps in foreign investment, projects,
and support and by **[advancing NATO interests]{.underline}**. [Turkey
can advance its mutual interests with NATO in Afghanistan while pursuing
its own objectives as an aspiring power in the region]{.underline}. [A
successful bid in helping stabilize Afghanistan could elevate Turkey as
a necessary and capable security player in the region and to its
allies]{.underline}---two longstanding goals of the Erdogan government.
During an August 25, 2021, speech to celebrate the anniversary of a
historic Turkic battle, Erdogan said "We transformed from a country of
existential battles inside its own borders to one that has a say in
every critical matter in the world."\[11\] This self-perception of
Turkey as a regional powerbroker helps drive President Erdogan and
Ankara's top leadership's pursuit of more activist policies beyond
Turkey's immediate neighborhood---including in Afghanistan.

Turkey will likely perceive one or multiple of the following objectives
in the near term as advantageous to its regional and global standing:
Deliver legitimacy to a new Afghan government: [**As a Muslim NATO
country**, Turkey could be a useful partner for the Taliban leadership
to gain international acceptance and legitimacy as well as access to
global financial systems]{.underline}. Advance the Turkish security role
in line with, and beyond, NATO [goals: Turkey has been offering military
training and security cooperation]{.underline} deals to an increasing
number of developing countries. Turkish forces have hosted Afghan,
Somali, Azerbaijani, Pakistani, Libyan, and other security forces for
capacity-building trainings as part of, or beyond, NATO missions. Turkey
will likely continue its trainings with Afghanistan and offer new
technical and military cooperation opportunities to the Taliban
government. Insert Erdogan-friendly Turkish companies to Afghanistan for
profit: Turkish companies with strong ties to the Erdogan government
have won significant reconstruction contracts in Libya, Iraq, Somalia,
Syria, and elsewhere. Turkey will likely look for similar construction
and investment opportunities in Afghanistan for profit and to benefit
the crony network Erdogan cultivates for government-friendly companies.
Improve Turkey's position within NATO: **[Turkey is one of the few, if
not the only, NATO countries that will maintain a diplomatic mission in
Afghanistan.]{.underline}** [It has also been in frequent contact with
many NATO allies to discuss developments in Afghanistan and demand
financial support.]{.underline}\[12\] Ankara will seek to use its unique
position in and access to Afghanistan to improve relations with NATO
allies, particularly the United States, and gain concessions. Posi[tion
Turkey as a regional power for security and stabilization]{.underline}:

Asian countries, and Pakistan [could work with the Taliban if they take
"positive steps]{.underline}" during a speech on August 29.\[13\]
Erdogan has not specified what those steps include or how Turkey might
support them, but [Turkey could leverage its ties to Central Asian
countries to promote regional security initiatives.]{.underline}
Meanwhile, Ankara also faces the risks of deteriorating public opinion,
increased refugee flows, and growing financial costs

But Turkey is now recalibrating its Middle East policy, with [Ankara
using more conciliatory language and, more importantly, taking steps to
repair the ties with Egypt with a Turkish delegation]{.underline} headed
by deputy foreign minister Sedat Onal visiting Cairo and foreign
ministers of both countries expected to meet towards the end of May. It
is plausible to anticipate Cairo and Ankara will exchange ambassadors
and have more ministerial-level meetings, but a presidential-level
meeting is not on the horizon For Ankara, a demarcation deal with Egypt
in the Eastern Mediterranean outweighs all other considerations because
such a deal further prevents the emergence of a regional energy and
security order in the Eastern Mediterranean without Turkey. But Egypt's
priority is the Libyan conflict and the presence of the Egyptian
opposition actors and media in Istanbul. Given the long existence of
shared border and security concerns, Libya is to Egypt what Syria is to
Turkey, and so **[the broader context of Turkish outreach efforts
towards Egypt]{.underline}** **[is the sense in Ankara that the Middle
East is in a post-Arab Spring era with the significance of political
Islam -- specifically the Muslim Brotherhood -- in regional politics
dramatically decreased.]{.underline}** Agreement through compromise
Instead of a full-fledged normalization, Turkey and Egypt will end up
meeting each other halfway at best. Egypt is unlikely to sign a maritime
demarcation deal with Turkey in the Eastern Mediterranean anytime soon,
but will be mindful of Turkey's claimed maritime borders and the
parameters of the Turkish-Libyan maritime deal when signing deals with
third countries or international energy companies. In response, [Turkey
will likely adopt a more accommodating stance towards Egypt in Libya,
with Ankara more receptive to Egyptian demands to withdraw pro-Turkish
Syrian fighters]{.underline} from there. But this withdrawal will be
conditional on the withdrawal of other foreign fighters from Libya,
including Russian Wagner fighters, and Ankara continues to resist the
demand for Turkish forces leaving, citing the argument they are there as
a result of an agreement with Libya's UN-recognized Government of
National Accord (GNA). To placate Egypt, Turkey is pressuring the
Istanbul-based Egyptian opposition media to tone down criticism of the
regime, but is unlikely to ask Egyptian opposition figures to leave
Turkey as many of them have acquired either Turkish citizenship or legal
residence. [It is plausible to anticipate Cairo and Ankara will exchange
ambassadors and have more ministerial-level meeting]{.underline}s, but a
presidential-level meeting is not on the horizon. Saudi relations in
deep crisis On the Turkish-Saudi front, relations were left in deep
crisis by a personal vendetta between the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed
bin Salman and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, which developed
following the killing of journalist Jamal Khassoghi at the Saudi
Consulate in Istanbul. This means a thaw in the relations is more
difficult to achieve, and the prospect appears to be for a more
turbulent period in Ankara-Tehran relations as the number of disputes
between them increases. **[Motivation for this desire to repair
relations with the Arab states is the fact that any new nuclear deal
between the US and Iran is highly likely to affect the regional
blocks]{.underline}** But [Turkish desires to mend the ties with Saudi
Arabia are strong, as evidenced by Turkey foreign minister]{.underline}
Mevlut Cavusoglu [visiting Riyadh despite the announcement eight Turkish
schools are to close in the kingdom and the imposition of an unofficial
boycott on Turkish goods. On the Yemen conflict, Ankara is likely to
adopt a more pro-Saudi position and to continue reaching out to Saudi
Arabia for a rapprochement.]{.underline} [Motivation for this desire to
repair relations with the Arab states is the fact that any new nuclear
deal between the US and Iran is highly likely to affect the regional
blocks.]{.underline} In fact, [Tehran and Ankara are increasingly
engaging in acrimonious exchanges, leaving their relations currently
rather tense]{.underline} -- **[these growing strains in Turkish-Iranian
relations further reinforce Turkish desire to mend the ties with the
Arab states.]{.underline}** Turkey's militarized regional policy --
heavily in vogue from 2016-20 and relatively risk-free thanks to Donald
Trump's US presidency -- has now run its course, with the exception of
operations in Iraq. In its place, there are now three major factors
shaping the new Turkish approach -- the new US administration, a
prospective deal between the US and Iran and its impact on regional
blocks in the Middle East, and an anti-Turkey geopolitical realignment
in the Eastern Mediterranean. From a wider foreign policy perspective,
it is clear **[Turkey is working hard to end both its international
isolation and its loneliness in the Eastern Mediterranean
region.]{.underline}**

#### Turkey's key to ME stabilization 

**Sandano 3/4-** Assistant Professor, Department of International

"Change in Turkish foreign policy toward the Middle East," MAR 04, 2022,
https://www.dailysabah.com/opinion/op-ed/change-in-turkish-foreign-policy-toward-the-middle-east)//mcu

Turkish foreign policy mainly aims to protect its interests in a
strained global and regional environment. Turkey always tried to create
conditions for sustainable peace and development with both neighboring
and more distant states. Ankara has recently become more involved and
active in the Middle East. Some analysts are of the view that this
change indicates Turkey is moving away from the West, as they observe
that Turkey\'s confidence in the region is mismatched with its Western
coordination. However, others believe that security, power projection,
rational considerations and a mix of national interests have forced
Turkey to drive its foreign policy toward the Middle East. After the
Arab uprising, regional geopolitics and security challenges opened new
channels for Turkish foreign policy, which led Ankara to even get
involved in the region. It started humanitarian and economic
engagements. With the passage of time, [Ankara's involvement in the
Middle East has extended and it has become the third party in the
regional conflicts]{.underline}. [To normalize ties with the Middle
Eastern countries,]{.underline} especially with [Saudi
Arabia,]{.underline} the United Arab Emirates [(UAE) and Israel, would
open new channels for]{.underline} augmenting [Turkey's diplomatic,
strategic and economic assets in its foreign policy.]{.underline} The
strained ties the between leading regional actors have proven
deleterious to understanding the true prospect of economic relations. A
shift and a response The shift in Ankara's Middle East policy is a
response to external factors -- both regional and international, and
domestic issues related to security and economy. [Turkey has begun to
change its positions and restart its relations]{.underline}, which had
previously been based on hostility. Washington has always remained a key
player in the Middle East, but the United States administration under
President Joe Biden prioritized East Asia, focused on its own domestic
matters and has pushed away diplomacy in the Middle East, unlike the
previous Donald Trump administration. In the meantime, the U.S. has
started reevaluating its military forces from the region. The U.S. has
made it clear that it will not be part of the Saudi intervention of
Yemen, and Washington may go back to the nuclear deal with Iran. These
changes triggered and pushed Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt and the
UAE towards a de-escalation process. On the other hand, Russia\'s
growing influence and the U.S. decreasing engagement in the region
pushed Turkey to act it to balance between the two. Turkey has a long
relationship with the U.S. and Russia, but with some differences --
however, it has maintained a good balance in Syria and Libya. In this
context, **[Ankara's Middle East policy has shifted into a new track to
rebalance the region]{.underline}**. Saudi Arabia a key actor Last year
at the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Summit, [Gulf countries signed the
Al-Ula declaration]{.underline} and formally ended the dispute with
Qatar. [This]{.underline} regional development [created further
encouragement for Ankara to take the plunge]{.underline} with Riyadh,
Cairo and Abu Dhabi. Since then, [Turkey and Qatar have started
negotiations with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE for
reconciliation]{.underline}. [Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [is one key
regional player in the Middle East region]{.underline}. The [good
relations between Ankara and Riyadh would prove to be a game
changer]{.underline} for this region. **[The cooperation initiative has
been started between Ankara and Riyadh]{.underline}**, [their relations
have appeared]{.underline} in a [positive]{.underline} dynamic after a
phone conversation between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Saudi
Arabia's King Salman ahead of a G-20 leaders summit in 2021. Recently,
Erdoğan visited the UAE for bilateral and economic cooperation with a
flurry of agreements during his first visit to the Gulf state since
2013. No doubt, [Riyadh also wants close relations with
Ankara]{.underline}, which will help Saudi to counter rivals or
disrupters. [The normal ties between Riyadh and Ankara would take
preference over all regional reconciliation efforts. This move would be
a good option for Saudi Arabia]{.underline} to get much-needed space [to
enhance its capacity for political activity, connectivity, and
cooperation]{.underline} with various other regional states, which are
perceived as Riyadh's rivals. **[Better relations between both states
would open new economic, political and defense
opportunities]{.underline}**, where Saudis may retain their traditional
regional role and effectively deal with security challenges. [The
regional power game]{.underline} between the main stakeholders of the
region [is persistent strategic competition, which will **only
destabilize** their diplomatic positions, and create more economic cost
than benefits]{.underline}. The current developments and [the changing
nature of their regional de-escalation approach is a sign of a
**reconciliatory drift** in the region, which will normalize the
strategic and economic situation in the region]{.underline}. To sum up,
regardless of the problems in balancing Saudi Arabia, Iran and Israel,
[the current change in the foreign policy of the Middle East is a good
option for Turkey to move forward with win-win cooperation]{.underline}.
Certainly, [Turkey possesses such capability to go with Middle Eastern
countries for their collective cooperation.]{.underline}

### Swindland Bad

#### Inducting Sweden and Finland leaves NATO [exposed]{.underline} and [vulnerable]{.underline} to Russian aggression.

Emma **Ashford** **22**. Senior fellow, Scowcroft Center for Strategy
and Security at the Atlantic Council. \"NATO Should Think Twice Before
Accepting Finland and Sweden.\" Washington Post. 5-30-2022.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/nato-should-think-twice-before-accepting-finland-and-sweden/2022/05/30/b412ee2a-dff7-11ec-ae64-6b23e5155b62_story.html.

Yet [from the point of view of]{.underline} existing NATO members ---
and particularly [the US --- it's still not necessarily a net win.
Finland and Sweden have long focused their militaries on defending
**their own territories**, raising **doubts** about their value in
contributing to a common defense]{.underline}, which is at the heart of
NATO's charter.

And while both nations have pledged to increase their military spending
and ability to bolster Europe's broader defenses, it is also possible
that they would not. Instead, [they may **free-ride** on America's
military strength --- and its **nuclear umbrella** --- as so many
European states have done for years]{.underline}. According to the
International Monetary Fund, [**neither** country **comes close** to
meeting the NATO goal of **spending 2%** of GDP on defense.]{.underline}

History suggests [the most likely outcome is two more states **adding**
to America's **defense burden** at a time when Washington should be
**pivoting** to **Asia**.]{.underline}

Consider also the question of the defensibility of new NATO territory.
Admitting Sweden could be strategically beneficial, allowing NATO forces
to better control the Baltic Sea and to use Gotland Island, at an
important chokepoint off the Baltic States, as a staging ground for any
future conflict.

[Finnish territory, in contrast, is a **strategic nightmare**. It would
**dramatically increase** the alliance's **exposure** to any **future
attacks** by Moscow: the country shares an **800-mile** border with
Russia that]{.underline}, as a recent study from the Center for
Strategic and International Studies put [it, is "**highly exposed** to
Russian military threats."]{.underline}

There are grab bag of other reasons for caution, including the usual
concerns about expanding the alliance to an ever-more unwieldy set of
member states. It doesn't take a genius to predict that [32 nations will
be **even harder** to manage than 30]{.underline}. Before its Ukraine
moment, NATO was struggling to maintain the peace between Greece and
Turkey, few nations were meeting the 2% spending goal, and President
Emmanuel Macron of France had drawn headlines for suggesting the
alliance was experiencing "brain death."

Even in the face of Russia's aggression, [support for adding the two
members isn't unanimous]{.underline}. Turkey's vehement opposition to
Finland and Sweden may be an attempt to wring political concessions from
the alliance, but also owes a lot to these countries' support for
Kurdish causes.

[Alliance leaders should also consider the risk of **Russian
overreaction**. Moscow has started **three wars** over **potential**
NATO expansion --- **invading Georgia** in 2008 and **Crimea** in 2014
before the current war.]{.underline} While Moscow is clearly not able to
stage another major military campaign right now, [one cannot rule out
President Vladimir **Putin** doing something **irrational** in
**response** to a NATO expansion that takes the alliance within **200
miles** of his birthplace of St. Petersburg.]{.underline}

At the same time, it's not clear that Finland and Sweden are at
increased risk unless they are allowed NATO membership. [They have long
**relied** on their **neutral status** and **domestic** defense capacity
to **prevent crises**. Refusing to admit them to NATO is not hanging
them out to dry, but simply **retaining** a **workable status
quo**.]{.underline}

#### Expansion [alienates]{.underline} Russia\-\--triggers arms racing and escalation.

aspect of Sweden and Finland\'s application to join NATO.\" CNN.

The [most striking aspect]{.underline} of Sweden and Finland\'s
application to join NATO [is how **little debate** there is about
whether it\'s a **wise idea**.]{.underline}

The entry of the two Nordic nations would be the most significant
geopolitical outcome of the Ukraine war, transforming the strategic
security picture in northeastern Europe and adding hundreds of miles of
direct NATO borders with Russia.

For decades, even during the most tense moments of the Cold War, neither
country seemed to feel the need to join the Western military alliance
despite their proximity to the giant to their east. But that changed
this year, after Putin sent tanks rolling across the border into Ukraine
in February.

Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson on Sunday called the invasion
of Ukraine \"illegal and indefensible,\" and worried that Moscow might
do something similar \"in our immediate vicinity.\" Finnish President
Sauli Niinistö told CNN the same day that the invasion indicated Russia
was ready to attack an \"independent, neighboring country.\"

Many analysts believe that one of the main goals of Russia\'s invasion
was to weaken NATO by taking Kyiv\'s possible future membership off the
board. If so, it has backfired spectacularly. The alliance is now
stronger and more united than it has been for years, and it could soon
be much larger.

But [**expanding** NATO could also trigger **serious reverberations**.
Doubling the security alliance\'s direct frontier with Russia would be a
**personal blow** for Putin]{.underline}, who has focused on undermining
the Western alliance since he first became Russia\'s President, more
than 20 years ago. And [if Putin felt Russia was **already** being
**hemmed** in on its western flank]{.underline}, could [adding **two
more** NATO members during the **worst tension** between the West and
Moscow in decades **exacerbate** the Russian leader\'s
**paranoia**]{.underline}?

In the 1990s, revered US diplomat George Kennan --- the founder of the
Cold War containment policy of Russia --- warned that [NATO expansion
would **alienate Russia** and cause an **adverse**
reaction.]{.underline} A contemporary counterargument would be that
Moscow\'s terrible losses in Ukraine, dented military prowess and
failure to siege Kyiv show that it is too weak to do anything about an
expanding NATO. And why should Putin get any say in who joins the
alliance anyway?

The Kremlin\'s response to Finland and Sweden hasn\'t exactly been
thundering so far. But [it\'s still a formidable **nuclear power** and
any decision to move missiles or tactical nuclear weapons **closer** to
**NATO borders** could **trigger** a new game of **brinkmanship** in
Europe.]{.underline}

#### Sweden and Finland in NATO incurs [multiple paths]{.underline} of Russian retaliation\-\--[provocations]{.underline}, [cyberattacks]{.underline}, [energy wars]{.underline}, etc.

[1) More **NATO provocations**]{.underline}

Over the years, [Russia has made **repeated** provocative **incursions**
near or into NATO allies' airspace and these seem to have **increased**
in **frequency** in the last few years. With **Sweden's** and
**Finland's** latest move to join NATO, **experts** believe the alliance
should prepare itself for more **provocations** from
Russia]{.underline}.

"[This **changes** the **security environment** for the entire **Baltic
Sea** and for the **Arctic**]{.underline}," retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges,
former commanding general of the U.S. Army in Europe, told CNBC on
Monday.

"Of course there will continue to be airspace violations, just like
there are over other NATO countries, but we're a defensive alliance and
we're going to react coolly and professionally. The last thing that the
Russians want is to get into a fight with all 30 NATO nations, soon to
be 32," he told CNBC's "Capital Connection."

"\[Putin's\] going to complain about it, he's going to threaten things
but he actually has nothing that he can do as most of his military is
tied up in Ukraine, so I don't see any real threat against Sweden or
Finland."

Russian provocations of NATO are nothing new. [In 2020, NATO air forces
across Europe were scrambled more than **400 times** to **intercept**
unknown aircraft approaching the alliance's airspace with almost 90% of
these missions **in response** to flights by Russian **military
aircraft**]{.underline}, NATO said in a statement.

Last March, NATO planes were scrambled 10 times in a six-hour period in
response to an "unusual peak" of Russian warplanes near the alliance's
airspace over the North Atlantic, North Sea, Black Sea and Baltic Sea.

[2) **Cyberattacks** and **soldiers**]{.underline}

Sweden and Finland have both insisted that joining NATO is not a move
against Russia but both concede the decisions have been taken in light
of Moscow's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.

Sweden's prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, told CNBC on Sunday that
her country felt NATO membership was the best thing for its security,
saying "[what kind of retaliation there can be is up to Putin, we see
there can be **cyberattacks** and **hybrid attacks** and other
measures]{.underline}, but it is all up to them," she told CNBC's Steve
Sedgwick in Stockholm.

Meanwhile, Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde said in the transition
period before Sweden and Finland become full NATO members, heightened
tensions are likely, noting "[we foresee more military **troops** close
to our border]{.underline}."

[3) **Energy wars**]{.underline}

[Another potential space for **retaliation**, and possible **Russian
punishment** for NATO's expansion, could come in the **energy
sphere**]{.underline}.

[Russia still holds a **powerful card** in this area because it has
traditionally accounted for around **40%** of the EU's **gas
imports**]{.underline}. And while [Europe]{.underline} scrambles for
alternative energy sources to reduce its dependence on Russia as a
provider of oil and gas, it [is **still reliant** on it.]{.underline}

Gilles Moec, group chief economist at AXA Investment Managers, said in a
note Monday that [there was an "ever so present possibility Russia
'**turns the tap off'**]{.underline} its supply to the EU" although he
noted that, so far Moscow has restricted itself to "half measures" which
have not dried up supply --- reflecting the country's own dependence on
these financial resources.

A [day after Finland's leaders announced their **support** for **NATO
membership**, Russian state-owned utility company Inter RAO announced it
would **stop** exporting **electricity** to Finland]{.underline} from
Saturday (Finland gets about 10% of its electricity from Russia) citing
a lack of payment as a reason, although [the move was widely seen as
**retaliatory**.]{.underline}

#### Escalates to nuclear war

**Buchanan 22**, author of "Nixon's White House Wars: The Battles That
Made and Broke a President and Divided America Forever." (Pat, "Why
would US give a war guarantee --- to Finland?," *The Journal*,
<https://www.journal-news.net/why-would-us-give-a-war-guarantee-to-finland/article_01922d40-31e0-5711-9225-ee78c610b3e4.html)//BB>

Nervous about Russian President Vladimir Putin's intentions, [Finland
wants America legally and morally bound to fight Russia on its behalf,
should Putin invade Finland as he invaded Ukraine]{.underline}. From the
Finnish point of view, this is perfectly understandable. But why would
the United States consent to go to war with Russia, the largest nuclear
power on earth, for violating Finland's frontiers? Finland is not
Alaska; it is not Canada; it is 5,000 miles away. And no one ever
asserted during the Cold War, or for the decades since, that Finland was
a U.S. vital interest. Why, then, would we consent, in advance, to go to
war with Russia over Finland? President Joe Biden said last week that
NATO has an "open door" policy and Finland and Sweden are welcome, and
he looks forward to their joining. Consider what Biden is actually
saying and doing here. He is ceding to Finland, a country of 5.5 million
people with an 830-mile border with Putin's Russia, the right to
obligate the United States of America to go to war with Russia, if
Russia attacks Finland. What patriot would commit his own country, in
perpetuity, to go to war on behalf of another country not his own? Why
would America surrender to the Finns our freedom of action in deciding
whether or not to fight a nuclear-armed Russia? NATO is not a country
club; it is a military alliance Putin regards as an enemy. Every member
of that alliance is obliged to treat an attack on any one of its 30
members as an attack on all, and all are obligated to come to the
defense of the nation attacked. By welcoming Finland into NATO, Biden is
offering Helsinki the kind of war guarantee Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain gave to Poland in the spring of 1939, which led to Britain's
having to declare war on Sept. 3, 1939, two days after Germany invaded
Poland. How did that work out for Britain and the empire? In his
farewell address, President George Washington warned his countrymen
against "permanent alliances." In conscious echo of our first president,
Thomas Jefferson warned against "entangling alliances." NATO is a
military alliance that has been in existence since 1949. While it began
with the U.S., Canada and 10 European nations, it ended the Cold War
with 16. We have since added 14 more. Six of the nations NATO added
since the Cold War --- Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia,
Bulgaria, Romania --- were members of the USSR's Warsaw Pact. Three of
the newest NATO members --- Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania --- are former
republics of the Soviet Union. The last quarter-century of NATO's
encroachment into Russia's space and onto Russia's front porch has been
a leading cause of the worsening relationship between the world's two
great nuclear powers. [The repeated refusal of Biden and Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to rule out NATO membership for Ukraine
was a primary cause of Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. This
does not absolve Putin of culpability in launching the war on Ukraine,
but [it should tell us that any new members of NATO]{.underline}, [in
Russia's "near abroad," especially a new NATO member with an 830-mile
border with Russia from the Baltic to the Arctic, is **running a real
risk and raising the possibility of war**]{.underline}. Indeed, with
Russia's war in Ukraine in stalemate, having failed to achieve its
objectives in Kyiv, Kharkov and Odessa, [Russian officials have
repeatedly raised the prospect of a desperate resort to tactical nuclear
weapons to stop the bleeding. "Escalate to de-escalate" is the
slogan]{.underline}. [Bringing Sweden and Finland into
NATO]{.underline}, which has already elicited rage from Moscow and
ominous threats, is unlikely to reduce whatever pressure currently
exists to **[escalate to nuclear war]{.underline}**.

### AT Baltic War

#### There's [no chance]{.underline} of US/Russia war.

Aleksandr **Khramchikhin 18**, Deputy Director of the Institute for
Political and Military Analysis in Moscow, 1/25/2018, "Rethinking the
Danger of Escalation: The Russia-NATO Military Balance", Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace,
https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/01/25/rethinking-danger-of-escalation-russia-nato-military-balance-pub-75346

In an atmosphere of crisis permeated by mutual recriminations and
suspicions, both sides---[NATO and Russia]{.underline}---[have engaged
in a series of **military activities**]{.underline} [along the line of
contact.]{.underline} [These]{.underline} maneuvers in turn [have
triggered multiple warnings from both sides of a sharp deterioration in
European security, a growing [threat of]{.mark} a **military
[confrontation]{.mark}** [between Russia and NATO]{.mark}]{.underline},
and an urgent need to deescalate the situation in order to avoid a
catastrophic war with disastrous consequences for all. An emerging
[conventional wisdom maintains that the new Cold War in Europe, if
allowed to continue unchecked, runs the risk of escalating into a hot
war]{.underline} unless steps to reduce tensions are taken swiftly.

But [conventional wisdom [is]{.mark} often **[wrong]{.mark}**, and so it
is this time. The **hysteria** that has engulfed public
commentary]{.underline} throughout Europe about this ostensibly dire
military situation on the brink of getting out of hand [has
little]{.underline}, if any, [basis in fact. [Both]{.mark} sides in the
standoff **[exaggerate]{.mark}** the [tensions]{.mark} and the danger of
escalation]{.underline}, and the risks of the military moves---their own
and their adversary's---supposedly driving these tensions.

In reality, [the military [balance]{.mark} between Russia and NATO [is
**stable**]{.mark}, the [danger of escalation is **hardly**]{.mark}
approaching **[critical]{.mark}** levels, and little needs to be done
militarily to defuse the current tensions. The true cause of the
tensions is not military, but political and diplomatic]{.underline}.
Until those causes are resolved, tensions between Russia and the West
will remain high. **[The [likelihood of]{.mark} a military
[confrontation will remain low]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however,
[[because neither]{.mark} side's [posture points to]{.mark} a
[heightened]{.mark} state of [readiness]{.mark} or intention to go on
the offensive]{.underline}. Until that changes, political and diplomatic
tensions will remain mere tensions.

THE BALANCE, THEN AND NOW

The best evidence that the military situation in Europe is stable and
that the continent is not on the brink of World War III is in the forces
that each side has available for conducting military operations. [Even a
brief [comparison of]{.mark} the [present]{.mark}-day [arsenals]{.mark}
of Russia and NATO [to]{.mark} those of the Soviet Union and NATO during
the height of [the Cold War]{.mark} should **[allay fears]{.mark} of
military conflict**]{.underline} (see table 1). This comparison should
also take into account critically important political and psychological
factors. Russia's and NATO's present-day forces do not measure up well
against their predecessors of a generation ago.

[One remarkable feature of the present situation is that even though the
number of NATO member states has nearly doubled since the end of the
Cold War, the alliance's order of battle across many classes of weaponry
has decreased since 1982]{.underline}, when East-West tensions were
high. Over the past quarter century, [military technology has developed
rapidly, new weaponry has come online, and many advances in warfare have
taken place. However, the [arsenals]{.mark} of most European countries
[have had **minimal**]{.mark} qualitative [improvements]{.mark} that do
not begin to compensate for the major reductions in their military
capabilities.]{.underline} Major acquisitions of military hardware have
been limited mostly to wheeled armored personnel carriers (APCs) to be
employed in expeditionary warfare.

[The [size of]{.mark} the [U.S.]{.mark} military [presence]{.mark} in
Europe has [decreased]{.mark} to an even greater degree since the end of
the Cold War]{.underline}. At the beginning of 2016, the U.S. military
had deployed ten brigades in Germany, but only two of these (the 2nd
cavalry regiment and 12th combat aviation brigade) were actual fighting
elements; the remaining eight were purely support units.1 One American
airborne brigade is deployed in Italy.2 In 2017, the U.S. Air Force
component deployed in Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom had nine
wings, but these are primarily support units, and there are only six
fighting squadrons.

[These [cuts in]{.mark} military [hardware are consistent with]{.mark} a
general tendency in the West]{.underline} (to a greater extent in Europe
than in the United States) [to embrace ideas of]{.underline} hedonism,
**[[pacifism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, postmodernism, tolerance, and
political correctness. A 2016 Pew survey found that [Europeans
overall]{.underline}, with the exception of the Poles and Dutch, **[do
not support increasing defence spending]{.underline}**. [Many Europeans
are reluctant to support the use of hard power in international
affairs]{.underline}. A 2017 Pew survey found that Europeans are also
divided in terms of their willingness to come to a NATO ally's defense
against Russia, with Germany, the UK, and Spain demonstrating the least
support. Along with the falling birth rates experienced in these
countries, this shift in defense dynamics makes it virtually impossible
to conduct a war that would result in major loss of life.

[As a result of these shifts in attitudes and ideological trends, NATO
troops may be unlikely to demonstrate heroism and willingness to make
sacrifices, elements that are absolutely essential in
wartime]{.underline}. [Almost all NATO countries have transitioned to an
all-volunteer military force, which has further **decreased the
motivation of their military personnel**]{.underline}, [or at least
suggests that they are motivated more by money than by
patriotism]{.underline}. The transition to an all-volunteer force has
also resulted in increased defense spending, for reasons that deserve
further consideration.

Like those of its NATO rivals, [Russia's modern-day military
capabilities do not compare favorably with the combined military machine
of the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies]{.underline} (see table
2). Even a cursory comparison of Soviet and Eastern European militaries
at the height of the Cold War---in 1982---and now makes clear that
Russia is not poised for offensive action in the European theater.

THE HIGH COST OF WAR

[[NATO forces are highly sensitive to]{.mark} the risk of incurring
[casualties]{.mark}]{.underline}, and this heightened sensitivity was
one of the reasons many Western countries chose to develop a concept of
noncontact network-centric warfare heavily reliant on precision-guided
munitions (PGM). However, this approach requires extremely expensive
weaponry, equipment, ammunition, and supplies. Shrinking NATO military
forces and arsenals mean that significant losses of lives or hardware
have become unacceptable: losing even a few tanks and aircraft is now
almost a catastrophe, comparable to losing a battleship or an armored
division.

[A [high-intensity war that calls for large stocks of ammunition
is]{.mark} also becoming **[prohibitively
expensive]{.mark}**]{.underline}---a trend illustrated by the evolution
of wars that NATO countries have waged over the last quarter century. In
1991, NATO countries, with significant support from both Egypt and
Syria, roundly defeated Iraq's large and well-equipped army in Operation
Desert Storm. The coalition against Iraq used PGMs only against
high-value targets in the Desert Storm campaign.

### AT Arctic War

#### No Arctic war\-\--their ev is all hype.

Øystein **Tunsjø 20**, professor and head of the Asia programme at the

the Arctic," Survival, Vol. 62, No. 5, 09-23-2020,

In recent years [there has been an abundance of studies, reports,
articles and statements presenting the Arctic as a new
frontier]{.underline} for resource extraction and sea lanes of
communication.1 These studies claim that the receding Arctic ice
provides not just commercial opportunities, but also security challenges
that could fuel great-power rivalry and conflict.2 Yet, despite the
hype, there is little likelihood of a shipping bonanza or a
natural-resource boom in the Arctic.3 This does not mean that climate
change is unimportant for the region -- we can expect more shipping
activity, investment and competition as the ice cap recedes. But it is
important to maintain a balanced view of the opportunities and
challenges presented by the 'new Arctic'.4

Equally important, the **[[stakes in a changing Arctic are not high
enough to warrant]{.mark} a [great-power
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As in the past, [[it remains
unlikely]{.mark}]{.underline} that [military [force will be
used]{.mark}]{.underline} to resolve a conflict originating in the
Arctic. It is more likely that any [potential great-power
[competition]{.mark}]{.underline} in the High North [[between Russia and
NATO]{.mark} will [reflect]{.mark}]{.underline} the [more consequential
sources]{.underline} of competition and conflict [in [Eastern or
Southern Europe]{.mark}]{.underline} -- in other words, that conflict
might spill over into the High North from somewhere else.5 Developments
in the Arctic appear to have caused some observers to forget that
[[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} recent [naval [build-up
is]{.mark}]{.underline} [primarily focused on [safeguarding
traditional]{.mark} Russian security [interests]{.mark}]{.underline},
such as maintaining its sea-based nuclear deterrent and contesting sea
lanes of communication in the North Atlantic. Thus, it is a familiar
security challenge -- Russia's rivalry with the United States and NATO
over the European security order -- that has the highest potential for
creating conflict in the Arctic.

Similarly, the recent focus on [[China's]{.mark} Arctic [ambitions
minimises]{.mark}]{.underline} the [importance of the changing balance
of power in [East Asia]{.mark}]{.underline} as the primary source of
US--China competition. Beijing's foremost security concern is the US
response to China's activities in its own maritime periphery, but
Chinese behaviour will also determine the United States' global
strategic priorities. Sino-American competition will compel the US to
prioritise the Asia-Pacific, and thus to draw down its commitments to
other regions. This will constrain its options in the High North.

[Since [European states are **unprepared** to substitute]{.mark} for
American power, **Russian [advancements]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Europe
and the Arctic **[will primarily [reflect US retrenchment and]{.mark}
[European inertia]{.mark}, rather than improved Russian
capabilities]{.underline}**. Moreover, heightened US--China competition
in the Arctic, much like heightened competition with Russia, will be a
spillover effect of US--China rivalry in East Asia.

The new Arctic: land of opportunity?

[One of the [leading champions]{.mark}]{.underline} of the new Arctic
[has been [the Norwegian government]{.mark}]{.underline}. It defined the
region as a national priority in 2005 and launched an international
diplomatic offensive to increase international awareness of its
supposedly vast potential. In a speech in 2006 at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, Norway's
then-minister for foreign affairs Jonas Gahr Støre declared that 'in the
years to come ... the High North will be one of the most important
strategic areas in the world'.6 In 2014 Oslo released 'Norway's Arctic
Policy', which stated that 'the Arctic is the Norwegian Government's
most important foreign policy priority', adding that 'access to energy
resources and other natural resources is becoming easier, and new trade
routes are opening up in the north. All this is creating new
opportunities.'7 [Such claims have been echoed in other
countries]{.underline} too. US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, for
example, emphasised in a speech to the Arctic Council in May 2019 that

the Arctic is at the forefront of opportunity and abundance. It houses
13 percent of the world's undiscovered oil, 30 percent of its
undiscovered gas, and an abundance of uranium, rare earth minerals,
gold, diamonds, and millions of square miles of untapped resources ...
Steady reductions in sea ice are opening new passageways and new
opportunities for trade.8

[This kind of [public diplomacy, along with **exaggerated**]{.mark}
media [reporting]{.mark}]{.underline}, appears to have [[contributed
to]{.mark} the circulation of [imprudent claims and unfounded
assumptions about]{.mark} the opportunities presented]{.underline} by
the new Arctic -- and [about the [likelihood of conflict]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}.9

#### Russia's [peaceful]{.underline} in the Arctic and will [pursue cooperation]{.underline}.

Exaggeration". Valdai Club. Jul 7 2020.

[As [Russia's government]{.mark} has [promoted]{.mark} a more **[visible
presence in the Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}---nervously observed by
international governments aware of Russia's increased military presence
in its High North---a few **[related critical points seem often
disregarded.]{.underline}**

In summer 2007, while both the Mir-1 and Mir-2 submersibles were
assisting a planned Russian government expedition to map the seabed, the
famous flag-planting performance was funded by Frederik Paulsen, a
Swedish pharmaceutical entrepreneur and the event was organized by an
Australian-American group of deep-sea exploration enthusiasts. In other
words, this feat, which drew the ire of Canada's Foreign Minister and
focused international media attention on a "new Cold War," was unlikely
prearranged either to perform scientific research in support of Russia's
Lomonosov territorial claims nor as a statement of territorial
acquisition.

Although Moscow has always maintained interest in its Arctic, arguably
this interest is growing. A [[Russian]{.mark} naval
[doctrine]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}acknowledges that the Arctic is
among its priority regions, and Russia not only already possesses the
world's largest fleet of nuclear icebreakers but plans to increase its
size. This [[is used]{.mark} by some Western commentators [to point to
Russia's]{.mark} **military [advantage]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[]{.mark}relative to the United States in the Arctic. [From here,
[it]{.mark} then [is a **short-stretch**]{.mark} for some
commentators]{.underline} [[to]{.mark} note]{.underline} that [the 2014
events]{.underline} [concerning]{.underline}
Russian-[[Ukrain]{.underline}]{.mark}ian relations
[demonstrate]{.underline} [Russia's]{.underline} [readiness to **bend
and at times break** the rules of international conduct.]{.underline}

[**[But]{.underline}**]{.mark} as have other Arctic and non-Arctic
states, so too has **[[Russia benefited from]{.mark} international
[cooperation and rules-following in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
This is not least because the [complexities of operating in the Arctic's
exceptional environment demonstrates that [collaboration is]{.mark}
**inherently [positive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It is [this "exceptional
environment]{.mark}" that [makes]{.mark} certain [Arctic
endeavors]{.mark}---such as **search and rescue efforts, scientific
research, and marine pollution response**---[transnational]{.mark}, and
consequently **encourages collective responses**]{.underline}. Further,
the economic development of the Arctic---a transnational region with
major emerging market opportunities---is a key strategic objective of
Russia. President Putin, for example, recognizes that "The Northern Sea
Route as an international transport artery will rival traditional trade
lanes." Businesses require certainty and regulatory stability in order
both to minimize their risks and to pursue investing in the Arctic.
Uncertainties associated with an unstable political environment can lead
to a reduction in investment and diminished economic interest in the
Arctic---a situation both Arctic and non-Arctic stakeholders are
determined to avoid.

Although the placement on August 3, 2007 of a titanium flag on the
seabed grabbed headlines, this was not the first time a flag was planted
in the vicinity of the North Pole. On his third polar expedition, and
his eighth and final journey to the circumpolar north---later
investigated and approved by the National Geographic Society---US
Commander R. E. Peary placed an American flag at a point on the
ice-covered Arctic Sea, somewhere nearby the earth's north geographical
pole. To commemorate this event, Peary claims to have written a note,
placed it in a glass bottle, and then hid it in an ice crevice:

> I have this day hoisted the national ensign of the United States of
> America at this place, which my observations indicate to be the North
> Polar axis of the earth, and have formally taken possession of the
> entire region, and adjacent, for and in the name of the President of
> the United States of America.

When Peary reached Indian Harbor, Newfoundland in early September 1909,
he sent President Taft a telegram:

> William H. Taft, President of the United States, Washington, D. C:
> Have honor of placing North Pole at your disposal. R. E. Peary, U. S.
> N.

In contrast to the media headlines generated by Artur Chilingarov's
titanium flag-planting, Peary's attempt to do precisely what Foreign
Minister MacKay was so against produced at least one attention-grabbing
headline in the September 9, 1909 edition of the San Francisco Call:
"Taft Does not Want Pole." Indeed, in partial response to Peary's
generous offer, President Taft replied, "Thanks for your interesting and
generous offer. I do not know exactly what I could do with it." Of
course, there is an even more recent example of the United States
flirting with the possibility of buying US sovereignty further into the
Arctic. Not only in 1946 did the US propose to pay Denmark \$100 million
to buy Greenland, but according to National Public Radio, "No Joke:
Trump Really Does Want to Buy Greenland" (NPR, August 19, 2019).

Although Greenland and Denmark made it clear to President Trump that
Greenland was not an empty lot with a "For sale" sign, Trump's fumbled
attempt at a real estate deal did further highlight that the Arctic is
increasingly viewed by some observers as an arena for geopolitical
competition. It further drew attention to the fact that the Trump
Administration has been slow to turn its attention to the Arctic region.
Consequently, the Department of Defense and the Navy each recently
issued Arctic strategy documents. And not only did the Coast Guard
produce its own Arctic strategy document, but to augment its two
operational polar icebreakers, the US Senate finally approved in summer
2019---after a two-decade delay---the Coast Guard's request for funding
to acquire the first of three planned new polar icebreakers. Although
the acquisition of new icebreakers is clearly intended to defend and
protect US interests in the Arctic, it is critical to note that the
Coast Guard's icebreakers are deliberately called "polar" because they
operate in both the Arctic and Antarctic. Further, a significant
proportion of icebreaker activities are conducted in support of the
National Science Foundation's (NSF) research activities in both polar
regions. Thus, it is problematic to distinguish actual new White House
policies from existing nor to identify statements made by President
Trump concerning the Arctic. Perhaps the clearest---if
unrevealing---statement offered by Trump on the Arctic was delivered
after his meeting with the Finnish president on April 23, 2018: "Both
leaders affirmed that it is essential to increase security in the
Arctic."

Although the Arctic has not been a high priority for the current
president, as in other international policy domains his administration
has nonetheless applied an uncooperative "America First" approach to
interactions with both allies and competitors. Such an unnuanced
strategy to international relations has led to uneven results and has
even caused uneasiness between the United States and Canada, its
principal Arctic partner. Although former Vice President Biden, Trump's
democratic rival in the approaching November 2020 presidential election,
has offered sharp criticism of President Trump's "America First"
approach, he has not yet clearly outlined how his administration would
work with Arctic state and non-state stakeholders. What is known,
however, is that **[the major global challenge of [climate change can
only be solved if countries cooperate]{.mark} with each other and reject
isolationism]{.underline}**. What is also clear is that [should
[Biden's]{.mark} bid to become America's 46th president be successful,
his [foreign policy]{.mark} priorities [would]{.mark} include
[re-build]{.mark}ing **[trust]{.mark} and unity among US partners while
[pursu]{.mark}ing [cooperation with]{.mark} its perceived [rivals
on]{.mark} issues where interests converge, which notably includes
[climate change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, Biden was among the
first US politicians to propose a climate change bill in the Senate:
More than three decades ago, Biden introduced the Global Climate
Protection Act of 1986. More recently, [Biden spoke]{.underline} in
January 2020 [on the importance of protecting the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge from oil and gas drilling and
development]{.underline}---a clear contrast with Trump's attempts to
encourage more fossil fuel production in Alaska.

The [increasing economic and strategic importance of the circumpolar
north requires more attention from US federal policymakers]{.underline}.
The Trump administration's neglect of Arctic policy has implications
beyond---but obviously including---the extended Arctic region. As
provocatively expressed in the Valdai Discussion Club's June 10, 2020
concept paper, "[The 'Arctic triangle' is emerging, consisting of the
USA, Russia and China, whose capabilities, ambitions and diplomatic
potential will **determine the future development of the Arctic
region**]{.underline}." **[[Strengthening "Arctic]{.mark} Triangle"
[relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**---and relations among all Arctic,
near-Arctic, and non-Arctic stakeholders more
generally---[[requires]{.mark} promoting possibilities where [**mutual
interests**]{.mark} can be developed]{.underline}; ensuring
international laws and institutions will continue to be respected; and
maintaining a peaceful and stable environment that is attractive to
investors and protects indigenous communities. **[[Despite disagreements
over NATO]{.mark}'s potential role in the Arctic]{.underline}**, the
inclusion of non-Arctic states in Arctic governance, and the place of
indigenous peoples in circumpolar decision making, **[both
[Russia]{.mark} and China [maintain respect for regional
governance]{.mark} structures [and]{.mark} international [institutions,
in]{.mark} particular [the Arctic]{.mark} Council]{.underline}**.
[Whether [through]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}Trump's benign neglect,
or President [[Biden]{.mark}'s application of Obama era Arctic
policies]{.underline}---and despite the National Geographic and other
news media's continued call for an "Arctic Cold War"---[[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will]{.mark} also continue to [respect
regional governance]{.mark} structures and international institutions,
and to pursue cooperation in the Arctic.]{.underline}
