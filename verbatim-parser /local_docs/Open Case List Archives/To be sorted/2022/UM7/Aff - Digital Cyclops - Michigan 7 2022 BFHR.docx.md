# The Digital Cyclops Affirmative \-\-- BFHR

#### Notes

Thanks to James, Guy, Michael, Steven, and Eleanor for their hard work
on this file. Please email <khirn10@gmail.com> with any questions or
concerns.

Notes from Michael Greenberg: The aff is a critique of communication and
thinking about technology. I want to make this explicitely clear -- the
aff says the **WILL** to technology is bad, not that technology
**itself** is bad -- you should read the cards to understand why but the
words "technological saviorism" and "digital salvation" absolutely need
to be in your vocabulary.

I think the best framework angle is either the glezos stuff or the
improvement bad angle -- either one implicates the subjecthood of
debaters, again read the 1ac ev it's pretty good

The neg imo is a lot weaker than the aff in terms of generics but the
critiques of aesthetics can be very good, and ofc framework makes the
game work so good luck

"God Won't Bless America"

[[It is Independence Day in]{.mark} America, 4 July 2020,]{.underline}
just three days after Canada Day in my political neck of the woods, and
I am thinking about where it all went so wrong and sometimes so right
for these missionary experiments in settler colonialism across the
Indigenous lands of Turtle Island. [From force of habit, [I attune my
perception]{.mark} [by]{.mark} [reading]{.mark} once [again the Book of
Revelation with its]{.mark} biblical [prophecy of a **violent coming
Armageddon**]{.mark}]{.underline}, once all the signs have been
fulfilled, while keeping another eye on Hannah Arendt's The Origins of
Totalitarianism, with its hauntingly perceptive analysis of fascism in
the lonely, disconnected age of mass society.5 [[Watching images of
social wreckage float by]{.mark} on the media stream -- today it is
Florida retirees giving a shout-out to "White Power" from their golf
carts and wealthy suburbanites in St.  Louis, Missouri, pointing loaded
guns at anti-racism protesters; tomorrow it will be other passing scenes
of the gathering social ruins -- [I turn up the volume]{.mark} on my ear
buds, which are tuned to the sounds of "[God Won't Bless
America]{.mark}]{.underline}." Performed at raucous levels by a punk
rock band, Vortis, from the heart of the heartless country of the
American Midwest, it is laying down some heavy tracks about the American
phantasmagoria as the bill comes due for the pleasures of the feast:

Tell me what is the answer to the troubles of our Times We're reaping
what we sow, we're paying for our Crimes {Chorus} God Won't Bless
America again We're on our own, we're all alone The voices on the sky,
only they won't die We're on our own, we're all alone We live in the
orgasmatron, the outstretched Scratching hand The power of the claws,
the law of the land {Chorus} In the land of the sea, the home of the
scared The cages will be shut, and no one will be spared We're on our
own. We're all alone.6

[[Everywhere the mood]{.mark} in the streets [is grim]{.mark}.
[Everyday]{.mark} beach [parties get giddier]{.mark}, city crowds more
crowded, faces unmasked, [hostilities more open, aggression frequent,
denial all the]{.mark} [rage]{.mark}, as a kind of plague frenzy takes
possession of society. I read the manifesto for Vortis [as an
**attunement to the psyche**]{.mark} of the times]{.underline}.
Following in the tradition of those other lonely hearts of renegade
philosophy and art -- Artaud and Nietzsche -- this punk rock band takes
its name from Vorticism, a brief, but immensely consequential, rupture
in art history (1914--15) just before everything was crushed by the long
slaughterhouse of the First World War.7 In that moment before
technologies of mass violence became the signature song of the twentieth
century, artists and writers, including Wyndham Lewis and Ezra Pound,
saw the dynamic energy of the vortex in everything. As the manifesto for
the band states, "Pound's master image of the vortex is an INVERTED
ELECTRIFIED CONE with an axis through the center, spinning furiously as
it emits brilliant sparks of light."8 Whirlpools, tornados, turbines,
cyclotrons for sure -- but now why not see the vortex as the way in
which energy fast circulates in everyday media? [The manifesto makes the
point: "[A **physical vortex organizes the energies of the
world**]{.mark} **through a whirling circular motion**, forming an axis
at its center, a vacuum [whose force of attraction **sucks the world
into it** and then spews it out in a continuous maelstrom.]{.mark}"9
It's just like the contemporary storm of politics, society, and economy
[in the era of **new communication technologies**]{.mark}: unpredictable
whirling motions of energy moving in fast circulation, [sucking the
world into its vacuum]{.mark} by its force of attraction and [then
spitting out the difference]{.mark}. And, there's not just one dominant
vortex, but multiple vortices in the media stream moving simultaneously,
sometimes intersecting one another, at other times like whirling motions
of energy independent, estranged, just [seeking to vacuum up]{.mark} all
[the particle energies of the world -- **and us with** **it**]{.mark} --
as just so many shards of broken glass, body clouds of the social ruins
within, as we are drawn into the axes of all the vortices that move
around us and through us every moment of the streamed media day. **[No
one has immunity]{.mark}:** certainly not the prevailing mood of mass
society, as [individual psyches are overstressed, overexposed, and
overstimulated]{.mark} by the rise and fall of anti-racism protests and
violent police blowback; definitely not asylum seekers, migrant farm
workers, and anyone below the poverty line, as their lives are sucked
into a storm not of their own making and certainly not under their
control and then expelled as so much waste material; and most clearly
not the new pilgrims of the digital way, who are attracted by the
whirling energy of new media only to find their nervous systems being
quickly amputated by the **powerful surgical force of artificial
intelligence**, granular surveillance, automation of just about
everything, and the mesmerizing vacuum force of social
media.]{.underline}

[The contemporary social scene, then, is under the sign of the **ecstasy
of catastrophe**]{.underline}: drift culture in the "inverted
electrified cone" of technological society, "with an axis going through
its center, spinning furiously as it emits brilliant sparks of light."
[Trapped in the high-energy waves of the future opening before us as a
horizon of violent vortices, we really have some clear choices:
passively drift like so much digital wreckage -- data debris in the
maelstrom -- waiting to be sucked into the energy field of the
technological storm all around us or actively adopt our own variations
of the strategy of this punk rock band from Chicago, who view themselves
as Vorticists, "assimilating as many energies of the world as possible,
feeling it deeply and intensely, and expressing their personal response
to its wild diversity"10 with discipline, energy, and
creativity.]{.underline} For me, at some deep and guiding interior
moment, that sounds just about right. [All around us today, we can just
hear the crash of implosive energies released **first by individuals,
then whole societies**, seemingly giving up on **life** and making their
peace with the **death instinct** that animates [the unfolding **story
of contemporary technology**]{.mark}. Call it what you will -- the
[outsourcing]{.mark} of [work in]{.mark} the age of remote
[communication, the externalization of consciousness]{.mark} that is
streamed media, empathy mapping for a society that has projected its
emotional life into the silent rustle of algorithms, soft-skin bodies,
and waiting for the robots. As a collective species, [we]{.mark} seem to
[have abandoned the complicated]{.mark} wrinkles of [life]{.mark}, with
its complexities and entanglements, [for **the promised peaceable
kingdom of the machines**.]{.mark} Maybe it was the continuous history
of massive warfare violence that has tracked us since the First World
War, the globalizing slaughter of the Second World War, haunting us with
its memories of concentration camps and mass death in the heart of
twentieth-century Europe and flaring up with wars that never end, some
brushfire warfare, others whirling contagions. Or perhaps [the]{.mark}
always [present vulnerability]{.mark} of that modern social invention,
the self not the soul, just literally cannot [take]{.mark} the stress of
radical overexposure in every surface and orifice to always [aggressive
technologies seeking to **inhabit consciousness, affectivity,
perception, and labour**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Whatever the reason, to
speak now of the death of the social and the eclipse of the individual
in a coming age of neural modification, massive data expropriation,
privacy abuse surveillance, and the deep learning algorithms of
artificial intelligence is only to make a cold-eyed clinical report of
the contemporary state of events. And, if you catch my drift, we just
might have an important choice to make before finally disappearing into
the surrounding sea of wired circuitry: the pleasant amnesia of drift or
something like the artistic strategy of Vorticism  -- deep immersion in
every passing whirling axis of energy, no fixed position in advance,
only fast responses with the aim of releasing the pent-up energy within
into "brilliant sparks of light," and, most definitely, being multiple,
variable, probabilistic, contradictory, with minds,
half-data/half-human, moving at particle speed. This last is my recipe,
at least, for learning how best to respond at particle speed to
lip-synching the future in the age of technologies of the new real

Machines to Bodies (M2B): Smart Bodies, Cold Data, and "Five Eyes"

Are smart bodies in a culture of cold data the probable future of
technologies of mass surveillance? [In response to the challenge of
bodily materiality, with its hidden passions, secret dreams, and
unexpected -- and often unpredictable -- actions, [the new security
state is rapidly moving towards]{.mark} the deployment of [a **new
generation of smart bodies**]{.mark} located on the always searchable
smart grid of technologies of mass surveillance]{.underline}. Since
machine readability is enhanced by biometric identifiers, the aim would
be to populate the skin surface with an array of sensors for improved
machine readability. For the moment, the transition to smart bodies
equipped with electronic skin tattoos, locatable media, and prosthetics
facilitating easy biometric tracking is marked by technical, and then
political, challenges, as [[the new security state works to
filter]{.mark}, archive, and tag the immense data [oceans of]{.mark}
global [communication]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is in this context that
there can be such dramatic political encounters between passionate
defenders of individual privacy and proponents of the new security state
interested in the total awareness provided by networked communication.

However, this period is probably only a temporary transitional one,
since [the implacable movement of surveillance technologies is towards
forms of automated surveillance of smart bodies -- machine-to-body
communications (M2B) -- that would quickly outstrip privacy concerns in
favour [of **continuous flows of individual bodily telemetry**]{.mark}:
its location, moods, nervous physiology, heart rate, affective
breakthroughs, and even medical emergencies]{.underline}. Taking a cue
from the pervasive networks of smart grids that have been installed in
many cities as part of managing energy consumption, [smart
bodies]{.underline}, like domestic homes before them, [are visualized as
inhabited cybernetic systems, high in information and low in energy,
emitting streams of machine-readable data.]{.underline} For all intents
and purposes, GPS-enabled smart homes are early avatars of the smart
body -- data tracking megaphones doubling as digital communication
devices. From the perspective of technological futurists, there is
nothing really to fear in the emergent reality of a smart future with
bodies enmeshed in dense networks of tracking machines, since those very
same bodies will likely also be equipped with counter-tracking
prosthetics  -- digital devices capable of quantifying the extent and
intensity of data emissions between bodies and the surrounding
environment of surveillance trackers. For example, the technological
futurist Kevin Kelly has stated that "we want to have coveillance rather
than surveillance" so that we can control who's monitoring us and what
they are monitoring.19 Some may argue that the human body, with all its
complex inflections and unbounded mediations, will never really be
reducible to a smart body circulating within a global smart grid, but
that argument is countered by noting the present migration of
surveillance technology towards a greater invisibility through
miniaturization, breaking the skin barrier with digital devices
functioning at the interface of biology, computation, and electronics,
and, in fact, layering the body with data probes designed with the
qualities of human skin itself -- soft, malleable, bendable, fluid,
elastic, tough.

[[A future emerges]{.mark}, then, [of **cold information**]{.mark}  --
diffuse, circulating, commutative, dissuasive -- [with bodies chilled to
the degree zero of **recombinant flows of information**]{.mark}.
Morphologically, information has always been hygienic in its coldness,
always ready to perform spectacular sign switches between **metaphor and
metonymy**. What this coldness means for understanding technologies of
mass surveillance is that the future of smart bodies will probably be
neither the dystopia of total information dominance on the part of
powerful interests nor the utopia of free-flowing communication by
complicated individuals, but something else, namely friction between
these warring impulses in the cynical sign system that is information
culture. Sometimes flows of [cold information will be contested]{.mark}
locally]{.underline}, whether **[[in debates]{.underline}]{.mark}**
concerning the policing of information and free speech in urban
protests, environmental contestations, and Indigenous blockades of
railroads, pipelines, and highways in isolated areas off-grid; or in the
abbreviated attention span of mass media. At other times,
[[**information wars** will be generalized across]{.mark} the planet,
with lines of friction leaping beyond the boundaries of specific states
in order to be inscribed in **[larger debates]{.mark}**]{.underline}
concerning issues related to surveillance and privacy, collective
modulations of soft control and individual autonomy, which move at the
process speed of instant, global connectivity across networked culture.
[Here, [the essence of cold information lies in the friction]{.mark},
the fracture, [the instant reversal of]{.mark} the **always [doubled
sign of information]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Defining this essence brings us to the meaning of surveillance in the
epoch of information as a flickering signifier, that point where all the
referents are always capable of performing instant sign switches from
villain to saviour, from active agents of generalized public scrutiny to
passive victims of destructive overexposure. Wouldn't this mean, though,
that, [in a culture of cold information]{.mark}, surveillance
[technologies]{.mark} must themselves **also [become flickering
signifiers]{.mark}**, simultaneously [both predator and
victim]{.mark}?]{.underline} Indications that this duality is the case
are everywhere today. For example, [the primary apparatus of
contemporary mass surveillance in the West is performed by a previously
undisclosed collaboration of state intelligence agencies, appropriately
titled "Five Eyes," because it coordinates sophisticated intelligence
signals among the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, and New
Zealand.]{.underline} Based on intelligence sharing agreements developed
during the Second World War, and strikingly similar in its pattern of
operation to the later "Condor" program that was created by several
Latin American governments during the dark years of the "dirty wars,"
Five Eyes coordinates flows of information acquired by upstream and
downstream surveillance among the governments involved. Currently
justified by political rhetoric framing the War on Terror and
consequently authorized by law or, at least, by loopholes in existing
law, Five Eyes is network conscious, geographically specific, and action
oriented. It tracks information, acquires individual targets, assembles
complex profiles of targeted individuals, and acquires massive
quantities of metadata limited only by the rule of the "three hops" --
tracking, that is, email messages, cell phone calls, or fibre optic
communication across the three hops of the originating message, the
recipient, and networks of individuals and groups communicating with
anyone and at any time in the first two hops. While Five Eyes has
attracted widespread criticism from privacy advocates for its relentless
attempts to establish an apparatus of total information awareness, it
should be kept in mind that [[the]{.mark} original and [continuing
motivation of this]{.mark} secret [apparatus of control has about it the
sensibility of an injured victim]{.mark} -- bunkered states living in
really existent existential, even psychic, fear of having their bounded
borders pierced, broken, and invaded by actual terrorists or by
phantasmatically [threatening]{.mark} [breaches]{.mark} of their
sovereign boundaries [by]{.mark} "illegal" immigrants, the nomadic, the
refugee, and [the **planetary dispossessed**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
example, as recently as spring 2020, CSIS, Canada's intelligence
contribution to the Five Eyes program, publicly protested that proposed
improvements to Canada's privacy legislation would seriously hinder
CSIS's ability to gather intelligence in the national security interest.
[A perfect fusion of aggressive surveillance and injured sensibility,
[Five Eyes constitutes]{.mark}, in the end, **[a flickering
signifier]{.mark}** -- a palpable sign of what is to come in the
approaching culture of cold information and increasingly overexposed,
smart bodies.]{.underline}

#### The resolution attempts to impose a will to technological transcendence -- reading the myth of digital salvation in favor of AI, cyber, and biotech culminates in the transformation of life into data-made-flesh, imposing a violent psychic commitment onto subjectivities while rendering marginalized bodies as accidental road kill on the way to a technological future

**Kroker** and Kroker **21** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and
adjunct professor of political science at the University of Victoria,
Marilouise Kroker - feminist scholar, publisher, editor, writer,
theorist, and performance artist, "Technologies of the New Real",
University of Toronto Press, Pages 153-156, October 2021, MG)

[Perhaps [it's no longer]{.mark} simply [a digital universe of blended
minds but something more generalized]{.mark}, namely blended bodies:
emotions, [subjectivity, imagination, perception living in a world of
data made flesh]{.mark}. Like a technological makeover of the Christian
Bible, which begins with the words "In the beginning was the Word" (John
1:1--3), [the digital bible begins with the **translation of the spoken
word**]{.mark} **of divinity** [into]{.mark} the **[cold data]{.mark} of
technological platforms**]{.underline}. And, while the biblical story of
the Word was recorded in prophecies of the Old Testament and gospels of
the New Testament as the coming of the long-awaited messiah, for whose
bodily sacrifice humanity would be indebted from birth to an
eschatological debt that could never be repaid, [[the digital bible
substitutes salvation by data]{.mark}, an epochal opportunity to shed
the skin of the human in favour of the soft skin of the digital. When
the story of this particular period in history is ultimately written,
[it will]{.mark} no doubt [focus on]{.mark} salvation by running the
numbers -- **[data made flesh]{.mark}** -- [as the animating impulse
behind]{.mark} skinning the digital world with DIY bodies, surveillance
that never sleeps, **drone** skies, robotic **[cyber]{.mark}**-machines,
singularity theory, **[artificial intelligence]{.mark}**, deep learning,
[and **biometric**]{.mark} sensors everywhere. Here, digital devices are
portals to the latest secular version of salvation, the instant
connectivity of smart phones a re-enactment of a religious state of
grace, **artificial intelligence a** **gateway to
transcendence**]{.underline}, globally synchronized emotion a mass
conversionary experience, [[desiring to become a data object]{.mark}
drifting [in]{.mark} the network a basic article of [digital
faith]{.mark}, and [the]{.mark} fast streaming of virtual life as so
many triumphant hosannas to the moment of digital
redemption.]{.underline}

However, just like the story of Christianity before it, this newest
reenactment of the [[myth of salvation in digital form has]{.mark} its
competing myths: one, **[the myth of order]{.mark}**, is literally the
attempt by power and capital to channel the explosive energies released
by network connectivity into a new digital order maximizing political
loyalty and economic profit; [and the]{.mark} other, **the [myth of
freedom]{.mark}**, is network society pushed to its limits and beyond by
a rising generation of blended minds, data flesh, and virtual
perception, particularly by the generation of the young today moving at
particle speed.]{.underline}

[If it is as true now as ever before that parasites are always quick to
the feast, that scavengers are often first to exploit the radically new,
the vulnerable, the tentative first beginning, then [the story of
**technologies of the new real is no exception**]{.mark} to the
historical rule]{.underline}. No sooner did the new salvation myth of
being digital take hold in the twilight years of the twentieth century
then it was immediately hijacked by standing powers, effectively
[streamed in the direction of technological platforms as a new digital
ordering of the world. Politically panicked by the ability of
fast-moving flows of data to instantly overturn the earthbound world of
national sovereignty, landed citizenship, bounded economies, framed
identities, and hardened borders, power everywhere responded to the
challenge by issuing its **own counter-challenge**: constant, ubiquitous
patterns of surveillance, [new **alliances between the
national**]{.mark} **security [state and]{.mark} major [technological
platforms]{.mark}**, the gathering of biometric data taking the form of
social credit in China and contact tracing in the West, always seeking
to upload our digital shadow, patiently going through the data trash we
leave behind for its [telling hints about our secret
motivations]{.mark}, hidden intentions, and questionable loyalties.
[Politics in the wires]{.mark}, then, became a scavenger hunt in the
data stream in the interests of **[preserving the power of the new
status quo]{.mark}**. It is the very same with digital capitalism.
Unlike the sovereign state, which is focused for purposes of its own
survival on preserving sovereignty over fixed, time-bound territory at a
historical moment in which real power has taken flight into the fluid,
space-bound empires of the digital, digital capitalism instantly shed
its basis in territorially bound bodies, manufacturing, and sales,
striking out for the monetization of the power of the flows of network
society]{.underline}. That's been the business history of the past few
decades -- the violent abandonment of blue-collar workers and their
factory-based jobs in favour of the higher exchange value of offshore
labour without a permanent home;
**[[transnational]{.underline}]{.mark}** trade
**[[agreements]{.underline}]{.mark}** making possible cheap, exploited
labour abroad and high-market consumerism domestically linked together
by the restless movement of robotic cargo ships; and the shedding of
traditional manufacturing by putting down the digital hammer of business
going online, either becoming transnational, wrapping itself in fluid
flows of circulating capital, or not existing at all. That is the
ascendant power of contemporary technological platforms -- [this new era
of digital capitalism with its dynamic, here today/gone tomorrow face;
its technological platforms that [place their]{.mark} fiscal [bets on
**bending the myth of digital salvation** in the direction of]{.mark}
killer apps, [digital fantasies,]{.mark} beautiful imaginaries of new
social media, [the everyday flux of data made
flesh]{.mark}]{.underline}. But having acquired unimaginable corporate
wealth by servicing network society, linking technological platforms and
willing subjects with digital devices, and thus [enabling the global
diffusion of digital reality, the economy is fated to ride the whirlwind
of the data storm. In the present social crisis, the most striking
expression of the new class reality of digital capitalism is the radical
split between ascendant finance capital in global stock markets and very
real economic distress in the streets]{.underline}, mass unemployment,
degradation of social and health services, and that most anguished
barometer of [inner anxiety, despair, and hopelessness -- the opioid
crisis. Here, [the winning classes of digital capitalism]{.mark} -- the
owners of technological platforms and their supporting technocratic
class -- [take **economic flight into a golden future**; while the
**economic losers**]{.mark} **in the new digital order**]{.underline} --
blue-collar workers abandoned with the destruction of manufacturing;
many white-collar workers soon to be [[discarded as **accidental road
kill** on the way to a future of **a**]{.mark}**rtificial
[i]{.mark}ntelligence [and robotics]{.mark}**; and the permanently
dispossessed, that is, the poor, the asylum-seeker, the unwanted
immigrant, the racially vulnerable, the ethnically disenfranchised, the
gender outlaw -- face devastation and a bleak future]{.underline}. No
less aggressive than the national security state in its pursuit of data
about its network subjects, [digital capitalism actually propels itself
forward by making intense, granular surveillance of the consumption
habits of its digital subjects a very exploitable opportunity for
massive capital accumulation in the form of relational
advertising]{.underline}, with every Facebook post enabling capitalist
exchange value, every Google search triggering a chain of capital
accumulation, every social media activity an addition to a very
marketable digital profile. [While digital reality may have been
inaugurated by all the conversionary enthusiasm, messianic commitment,
and [utopian data visions brought]{.mark} together [under the mythic
sign of digital salvation]{.mark} in the late twentieth century,
this]{.underline} twenty-first century, spiked by the technological
platforms of capitalism and power, has surely been marked by the eclipse
of digital utopia with the swift, [relentless [channell]{.mark}ing of
that original enthusiasm for life in the wires as salvation [into new
forms of digital ordering]{.mark}, including the national security state
and digital capitalism, which, if they fail to possess the original
intensity and dreams of digital utopia, have the more prosaic, but
seductive, quality of stabilizing the flo]{.underline}w, isolating
digital subjects within familiar borders including national identity and
property, [and **[channelling desire along]{.mark} all the [programmed
streams of power and capital]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.** Here, the
life-changing experience of being digital as a religious epiphany is
successfully replaced by the pleasures, dreariness, and growing screen
addiction of the new digital bourgeoisie with its disciplinary state,
austerity economy, and virtual phantasmagoria. [After digital utopia,
[we now have stasis; after the failed epiphany of digital
salvation]{.mark}, we face the enduring reality of taking our place,
quietly and without a murmur of dissent, in the new digital
order.]{.underline}

[So the story goes, **until life begins again**. That is the
contemporary social crisis]{.underline}. Messianic visions of the
singularity moment may still have very real momentum as [the leading
contemporary edge of the myth of digital salvation]{.underline}. The
COVID-19 viral pandemic may have precipitated a great shakeout of the
last vestiges of the pre-digital economy, accelerating tendencies
already under way towards a new digital order typified by remote
communication, automation of the service industry, [a real world of
artificial intelligence and deep learning, and all of it tightly
controlled as the proprietary knowledge of technological
platforms]{.underline}. Nonetheless, the stability of the new digital
order and the seduction of life in the wires have been challenged by the
insurgency that is life in the streets today, with its scenes of surging
political protests from cities in the United States, Canada, and Europe
to rebellions by Hong Kong activists against new security laws
promulgated by the Chinese state. All the while, other conflicts, other
insurgencies based on race, class, gender, ethnicity, and national
difference, have broken out seemingly everywhere, effectively
challenging the sovereignty of closed digital borders with demands  --
some fundamentalist, some visionary  -- for reimagining a future
off-grid to powerful machineries of surveillance as well as to
technocratic digital platforms. [[Power]{.mark} [today]{.mark} might
[reside in effective control over]{.mark} the **creation, programming,
distribution, and policing of [algorithmic codes]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} but
still the sounds and sights of life are palpably pushing up from below,
sometimes allowing sunshine to burst through cracks in the data shield
or maybe bringing with them a bit of cold, driving rain from the
outside, hot energy from the streets falling downwards, rising upwards,
threatening to rupture the set-piece framework of the new digital order
with all the contingency, indeterminacy, differences, and absolute
solidarities and hostilities that the human, now suddenly post-human,
condition can muster.]{.underline}

#### The will to technology and the exteriorization of consciousness onto technological saviorism are both the root cause and accelerator of masculine, racial, religious, political, psychic, and environmental violence

**Kroker** and Kroker **21** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and
adjunct professor of political science at the University of Victoria,

[If this era can be such a time of extremes -- protests against police
brutality, the resurgence of **[Aryan nationalism]{.mark}**, bitter
[political divisions, **religious fundamentalisms**]{.mark} at war
against secularism, **[LGBTQIA rights]{.mark}** guaranteed in law in a
few countries but savagely oppressed in many others, **[labour
disciplined]{.mark}** by primitive accumulation (work or starve) versus
growing oligopolies of finance capital]{.underline} -- perhaps it is
because, in part, [trajectories explored by [new media]{.mark} [have
slammed]{.mark} into the human condition with such [accelerating
violence]{.mark} that the resulting **[social, political, economic, and
environmental]{.mark} wreckage** all around us is like so much
free-floating debris after the blast. Key tendencies that were once only
theorized as [possible futures have now escaped the realm of]{.mark}
imaginary [futurism to become the alphabet of]{.mark} a
[society]{.mark}, indeed of a world, seemingly imploding.]{.underline}
We see panic anxiety as the key psycho-ontology of contemporary times:
[spasms of seductive misinformation circulating everywhere]{.underline}
through the interstices of information culture; [**[human
subjectivity]{.mark} effectively [reduced to data trash]{.mark}**;
digital delirium as the governing mood of a technological
society]{.underline} that advances with equal measures of magic and
menace; massive digital platforms breaking the skin barrier like body
invaders of the sci-fi future; [and everywhere possessed individuals --
possessed sometimes by reactionary beliefs, **[technological
transcendentalism]{.mark}**, or religious passions, but many literally
possessed also by deep, pervasive, [and]{.mark} mesmerizing flows of
[digital codes circulating through affect, imagination, and
consciousness]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this drift culture, only the most
extreme signals manage to break through the noise generated by flows of
information, [often taking the form of the hysterical male with his
anger over the loss of traditional masculinist privilege but, at other
times, **[rising white nationalism]{.mark}** threatened by what is
perceived to be a permanently threatening outside world and always, of
course, breaking news about those **[psychic breakdowns]{.mark}** in the
digital stream of those who can't or won't keep up to the speed of the
nervous breakthrough that is life in the wires. Overexposed,
overcirculated, overinformed, overablated, the triumphant age of being
digital with its dreams of universal connectivity has quickly made
visible all the broken connections of the past -- **[ethnic grievances,
religious differences, unresolved political feuds, gender violence,
sexual oppression, economic injustices, moral indifference]{.mark}** to
the lives of the asylum-seeker, the slum dweller, the immigrant -- just
as much as it has effectively stripped digital subjects of the saving
vision necessary for navigating the future. [When the dust]{.mark}
finally [clears]{.mark}]{.underline} from this gathering scene of the
ruins, within and without, [[the only thing standing will]{.mark} likely
[be the **will to technology**]{.mark} with its prophetic talisman [hard
at work on the]{.mark} human remainder: the **[exteriorization of human
consciousness]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the generalized synchronization of
emotion, [the ecstasy of finally becoming object-like, and the
virtualization of culture. In the gathering dusk, the codes of
technology are like digital sunshine on a cold, grey rainy
day.]{.underline}

[This situation can be clearly seen in the turbulent events occurring in
contemporary society with the very real fear over viral contagion mixed
with the quick return of politics in the streets with protests against
**[racialized violence]{.mark}**, and all of it multiplied in its
intensity many times over by the pressures of generalized economic
recession, severe job losses, and coming financial defaults.
[It's]{.mark} literally [a time of **imminent social chaos**]{.mark},
deep anxiety, palpable anger over **[racialized injustice]{.mark}**,
with the inevitable political backlash just waiting to express itself,
and all the while what is absolutely [strengthened by the crisis are
technological platforms putting down the codes for the will to
technology]{.mark}]{.underline}. Today, remote communication is the
digital lifesaver for an educational system that has quickly chosen to
disappear into Zoom; mobile communication with its rich array of digital
devices provides an instant working infrastructure for working online
and at a safe distance; the death of the face-to-face social rapidly
gives way to [streams of information, **[gaming]{.mark}**]{.underline},
news flashes, [[and communications as]{.mark} the [technical
lifeblood]{.mark} of network society]{.underline}; and most definitely,
the end of (traditional) work as we know it has been accelerated by the
pandemic with its reduction of the labour force to "essential services,"
clearing the way for [a future that will quickly link **artificial
intelligence**, deep learning, and creative robotics as the coming
labour force. Seemingly, everything moves now in the direction of
intensified, functionally required technological platforms]{.underline}.
Everywhere, of course, the present mood of political malaise, economic
distress, and social isolation contrasts sharply with the rising gains
of finance capital as the codes of capital accumulation move in
precisely the opposite, specifically virtual, direction from social and
political disturbances on the ground left behind. [Literally, [we are
witness]{.mark} today [to]{.mark} the profoundly historical moment when
**[the will to technology take]{.mark}s [off]{.mark},** quickly
achieving escape velocity, dynamically and spectacularly, from the
inertial drag pressures of the social wasteland. While it is
simultaneously predator and parasite, magic and drudge, fast (codes) and
slow (life), agent of creative destruction and equally visionary new
designs for the future, no one can know with certainty what a future
streaming the will to technology will look like. But again, there is
really no need to be a traditional futurist in this (digital) case,
since this is one time in **which [the future is already in our
past]{.mark}**. And that future  -- the future of fully exteriorized
consciousness, synchronized emotion, the desire to escape subjectivity
and become object-like, the triumph of virtual culture -- is in its
fullest measure deeply, immeasurably paradoxical.]{.underline}

For example, when the privacy of human consciousness has been broken
wide open by the nutcracker of digital technology, the result is fully
unpredictable in its incommensurability. While there may sometimes be an
impulse for the mind to go off-grid by undertaking private pilgrimages
away from the data stream -- a generalized strike against the media --
that is surely a challenging battle. [After all, how do you rid
consciousness of the **[codes of technology]{.mark} that [are already
embedded]{.mark}** as ways of seeing, framing of perception, gateways to
imagination, structures of reflection? More to the point, the
contemporary situation is something in the way of split consciousness,
which in practical terms implies pushing warnings about surveillance
culture to the periphery of attention and thus maintaining at least the
illusion of personal privacy while participating in life in the wires,
whether reluctantly or enthusiastically and for multiple]{.underline}
purposes. But in the end, how long can the stresses, tensions, and
contradictions of split consciousness endure? As the philosopher George
Grant once asked, how long can human beings endure the "plush patina of
hectic subjectivity lived out in the iron maiden of an increasingly
objectified world inhabited by increasingly objectifiable beings?"1
Fully exposed, its every movement digitally archived, tracked, and
recorded, [split consciousness is [a **daily battleground of bubbling
brains** in a coded world]{.mark}. When the digital sensorium touches
the highly sensitive matter that is consciousness, exposing and fully
externalizing minds waking up to find themselves in the digital stream,
everything is suddenly out in the open: Twitter wars erupting
everywhere, nuances lost, [competing ideas]{.mark} in constant
circulation, images jammed together without any particular pattern.
Here, [consciousness escapes]{.mark} its previous abode in the cranial
shell [to become something liquid]{.mark}, flaring up, [influenced by
swirling streams of information]{.mark}, breaking news, broken data,
riding the digital whirlwind like a raw exposed nerve, often overwhelmed
but with nowhere safe to hide.]{.underline}

[In the end, who can tolerate the deep wound of a fully externalized
mind?]{.underline} Who can quickly recover from the sudden injury done
to human consciousness moving at the speed of light? [What happens to
[consciousness]{.mark} when it is [suddenly transformed into a **psychic
playground**]{.mark} for unedited reality: continuously exposed to the
raw footage of terrible events without time for an intervening ethical
mediation;]{.underline} YouTubing screams of anger, rage, and pain with
no necessary understanding of their context; filtering unmediated
images, advertisements, analysis, and all the fun of the media circus
with the externalized mind's frame rate always stuck on wide open? [What
happens when [the]{.mark} suddenly [exteriorized mind becomes a data
catcher]{.mark}, a mood drifter, a lurker in the digital stream,
sometimes [a **vicious predator**]{.mark} intervening actively in the
scene, but usually [a digital voyeur]{.mark} absorbing like an
information hungry sponge all the spikes, ebbs, and unexpected swerves
of life lived under the accelerating velocity of the data
stream?]{.underline}

#### In the face of a resolution that attempts to control the [will to emergent technologies]{.underline} you should vote affirmative for a method of [anti-coding]{.underline} -- a process of [aesthetic resistance]{.underline} that implodes the code and unlocks the [technologies of otherness]{.underline} from the [technologies of violence]{.underline}

An Art of Electronic Theory

[There are [three aesthetic codes for understanding
the]{.mark}]{.underline} digital [[eye]{.mark}. Well, not really three
codes, but [three **anti-codes**]{.mark}, because I am not affiliating
myself with the grand récits of technological discourse]{.underline},
with the digital eye as a master discourse, a gridded space, for the
dynamic conquest of nature and human nature, but [[with]{.mark} that
more shadowy region of otherness, of **[aesthetic
supplementarity]{.mark}**, those flickering, enduring [aesthetic
anti-codes]{.mark} that, like the beat-beat rhythm of the errant human
heart or like the tearing up of the eye when it gets some digital dirt
in it, [just won't go away]{.mark}.]{.underline}

I haven't got any modernist illusions: I know the rules. I have studied
my Heidegger. I sense how deeply Heidegger was correct when he said that
in the twisting spirals of the dialectic of life and art and technology
and the human spirit, otherness, even dialectical otherness, aesthetic
anti-codes, work only to confirm the existence of the codes, and that,
ironically, [[anti-codes]{.mark} probably serve one last great
normalizing function -- they work to [energize the code,]{.mark} to
establish its limits, [but]{.mark} also to **[strengthen its
resistance]{.mark}**. Jean Baudrillard has been this way. He called it
'[the **terrorism of the code'** in the logistics of
production]{.mark}]{.underline}. So has Octavio Paz when he said of de
Sade:

Prisoner in your castle of crystal of rock You pass through dungeons,
chambers and galleries Enormous courtyards where the still black poplars
dance. All is mirror! Your image persecutes you. Man is inhabited by
silence and by space. How can this hunger be met and satisfied? How can
you still the silence? How can the void be Peopled? How can my image
ever be escaped?1

Roland Barthes went to his death still puzzled to the point of
intellectual and aesthetic paralysis by the shock of trying to
understand the full implications of this game of code and anti-code. [He
called it the empire of the sign, the empire of the cynical
sign]{.underline}, and as he regressed in books such as Barthes by
Barthes, 2 into those picture albums of memory, of photography as always
tinged by the solace of death, he muttered to himself words like: '[I am
a public square;' 'I am anachronic subjectivity;' [I am "**degree
zero**]{.mark}]{.underline}."' The same thing today for Paul Virilio,
who in the first chapter of Open Sky comes to an insight on the truly
radical implications of the quantum physics and relativity theory of the
1930s for understanding hyper-modern culture, [that [digital
technology]{.mark} actually moving at the speed of light [has]{.mark}
finally [overcome]{.mark} the resistances of local [time an]{.mark}d
local [space]{.mark}, [blasting us into]{.mark} the light-time and
lightspace of '[eyeball culture]{.mark},' that we're plunging upwards,
falling upwards, into the dimensionless space and vectored time of the
new world city of '**electrooptics**.'3]{.underline} In every one of his
books, War and Cinema, The Vision Machine, The Art of the Motor, Speed
and Politics, Pure War, Virilio is haunted, like Baudrillard, Barthes,
and Octavio Paz before him, by the electronics of perception, panicked
into getting off the freeway of accelerated culture, with its
dromological vehicles pirating human flesh in the name of
cyber-sexuality and telepresencing, getting off at the double exits
marked traditional religious ethics and traditional sexuality.

But why panic at accelerated culture? Why not do the reverse? If, as
Marshall McLuhan always argued, [[artistic vision is]{.mark} a point of
'**[maximal sensitivity']{.mark}** to the blast of technological change,
then why not insist that [the method for **understanding** **emergent
technologies**]{.mark}, the theoretical practice of a new electronics of
perception, [be deeply infiltrated and contaminated]{.mark}, indeed,
[overtaken and over-coded, by]{.mark} the [hyperaesthetics]{.mark} of
electronic artists. Not a theory of electronic art, but an art of
electronic theory, then, for understanding the visual codes of the
actual electronics of perception in the light-time and light-space of
culture under the optical sign of the digital eye]{.underline}.

Why not?

[[**Implode the code**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[An aesthetics of hyper-perception]{.underline}

An art of excess for a time of moderation.

An art of interminability for a culture fast-cycled with changing
fashions.

[An electronic art that rubs together code and anti-code, and refuses
the designation of the polarities.]{.underline}

[Art like bubbling electronic asphalt on a hot summer day.]{.underline}

[So, then three anti-codes for an art of electronic theory:]{.underline}

[[Its **ontology**: digital dirt.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Its **political focus**: technologies of otherness]{.mark} in the
cybernetics of the everyday.]{.underline}

[[Its **aesthetics**: digital incommensurability]{.mark} in the age of
calm technology]{.underline}

[The 1st Anti-Code: **Digital Dirt**]{.underline}

[What's the smell of **blood** on the digital tracks]{.underline}?
What's the sound of static deep in the wires? What's the colour of
electronic discharges as they bond flesh to the machine? What's the
speed of the body when it has been force-fed by high tech? What's the
rate of burn of the digital nerve as it blasts off from the gravity
field of the human sensorium?

The ruling illusion of digital reality is its antiseptic cleanliness. A
virtual hygiene movement that launches a global tech style that is
clean, cool, and cold. [[Virtuality as about the digital scrubbing of
the world]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The will to virtual hygiene can be so powerful because the really
existent animating force of digital life is dirt. Noise in the machine.
Liquid in the wires. Waste in the System. Accidents in the
codes]{.underline}. Distortions in the gifs. Mutations in design.
[**[Data Crash]{.mark}**. Indeed, it is [the]{.mark} [absence of
dirt]{.mark} that [haunts]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [virtual]{.mark} hygiene
[machine and without which the system as a whole loses energy, running
down to digital entropy]{.mark}. Ironically, the virtual hygiene machine
requires for its reproduction the anti-code of digital
dirt.]{.underline}

Scratch digital, perverse robots, spew electronic music, splatter cin-
ema, dance of mutant life-forms, artificial perversity, spit writing,
fleshmatic theory, multimedia graphics that nitro-burn ram memory --
that's digital dirt. A raw, unfinished, visceral level of life-giving
energy that animates the digital, seducing the codes of the digital eye
from going to ground in the sterilities of the virtual hygiene movement.
So then,

**[[Excess everything.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[**Intensify everything**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[An [end]{.mark} to all [mediation by the codes of
visuality]{.mark}]{.underline}

Or maybe just the opposite

Struggle to begin again and again

the over-saturation everywhere

of the codes of augmented visuality.

An art of symbolic exchange

An art of hyper-perception

[Storming broken interfaces,]{.underline}

[Searching out lines of electronic fatigue,]{.underline}

[Occupying digital slash marks between the **either and the
or**]{.underline}

[An electronic wound that refuses to heal]{.underline}

An art of hyper-perception

For a culture that is dying because of its lack of symbolic renewal,

Of its lack of mythic renewal

[The 2nd Anti-Code: **The Cybernetics of the Everyday**]{.underline}

[[Digital dirt creates counter-visions to the digital code by
privileging the cybernetics of the everyday]{.mark}. [Not just]{.mark}
the everyday [present and future, but the]{.mark} everyday [past as well
--]{.mark} listening also to ancient prophetic voices for what they have
to tell us about 'other' technologies of otherness.]{.underline}

In her book The Eight Technologies of Otherness, Sue Golding theorizes
another way of being technology.4 [[Not technology as]{.mark} a
[violent]{.mark} field of instrumental reason, [but]{.mark} more like
something Foucault might have thought in his Death Valley days,
**[technology as techne]{.mark}**, as a way of doing things, as a way of
escaping the shroud of identity politics with its over-privileging of
binary logic, and speaking not of difference, but [of the **indifferend
-- technologies of otherness**]{.mark} -- technologies of dwelling,
noise, contamination, cruelty, curiosity, appetite, skin,
nomadism]{.underline}. As Golding says: 'What if we were to stop
sterilizing the wounds? [What if we were admit that the so-called deep
and violent cut of meaning, truth, death, identity itself -- the "who we
are" and "what are we to become" of science and of life -- have
collapsed under their own bloodless and sexless weight.'5]{.underline}
Technologies of otherness, then, dwelling, comtaminating, moving,
nosing, being curious, being cruel, being multiple in the valley of the
cybernetics of the everyday.

So why not too -- technologies of disappearance -- as a way of keeping
alive deep memory and deep time? A grand unified theory of prophecy in
the bedlam of a coarse electronic culture? Nobody is listening, except
maybe for the wandering spirits of the disappeared and, of course, the
day and the night and the moon and the eagle and the trickster raven and
tired, really tired, human flesh. Animism is nothing to be ashamed of.
It's repressed knowledge. It's the forbidden eye. It's the ticket to the
truth of prophecy, of mythic utterance. That's why it has been so
discredited by all the demon-spirits of the virtualizers. An art of
electronic theory also begins with digital animism -- that's what we've
really been deprived of in the 'intimations of deprival' of the
technological dynamo.

Like recently, at that epochal event, at the gates of Yellowstone
National Park, where another technology of otherness took place, another
cybernetics of the everyday, another technology of disappearance.
Suddenly early in the morning a hundred Plains Indians gathered for the
first public performance in a hundred years of a dance honouring the
buffalo. Now, the urgency was directly political -- to change the
present policy of the Park Service, instigated at the behest of western
ranchers, where buffalo who haven't it seems yet learned anything at all
about park behaviour and park boundaries and being-buffalo for
highvelocity tourism, can be shot, and are shot, by the thousands if
they stray outside the buffalo bunker archaeology of the park. Now, the
reason is political, but the overwhelming feeling is mythological. The
Plains Indians acknowledge deeply the truth of ancient aboriginal
prophecies that the final death of the buffalo means the final death of
the people, but also that the return of the buffalo anticipates the
return of the people.

The report was as follows:

As a few hundred people watched beneath the snow-dappled peaks on the
northern edge of the park, Gary Silk, a Lakota Sioux, stripped to the
waist. As he stood in the numbing wind, in the shadow of the giant stone
arch that greets visitors here, other members of his tribe made two
incisions in his back with a surgical scalpel, inserted a stick in each
wound, and tied a buffalo skull to each stick with ropes.

Then, as 100 or so Indians sang and drummed and played an eagle bone
flute, Mr. Silk danced around a large circle dragging the skulls through
the mud and grass behind him.

After a half-hour of dancing, Mr. Silk stopped and someone sat on the
skulls. Mr. Silk grabbed a horse's tail and the animal pulled away,
ripping the sticks from his bloody wounds. Then, as people wept, Silk
joined the singing and the drumming.6

Now, what do slaughtered buffalo and the Lakota Sioux have to do with
the digital eye? It turns out: maybe a lot. The digital eye, like the
eye of the hunters of the western lands before it, sees nothing but its
own restless movement. The Lakota Sioux look into the eye of the buffalo
and see their past, and maybe our future.

[The cybernetics of the everyday, then, as also about recuperating the
language of animism and mythology and prophecy for an art of electronic
perception. Its admonitions: [Honour the disappeared, Respect
futility]{.mark}. [Counter]{.mark} the war spirit of electrooptics --
'[eyeball culture']{.mark} -- with the voices of prophets with their
sticks and scalpeled backs and crushed skulls and blood
sacrifice]{.underline}. Today, it's animism most of all that takes
flight in the gathering of the digital dusk.

[The 3rd Anti-Code: **Digital Incommensurability in the Age of Calm
Technology**]{.underline}

There's a new vision of the digital future coming out of the research
labs at Xerox Parc in Palo Alto. It's called 'Calm Technology.'7
According to Mark Weiser, Xerox's chief technologist at Parc, computing
has had three main trends -- mainframe computing where many people share
a computer; the personal computer typified by a one-to-one relationship
between the PC and its user; and now, facilitated by the possibilities
for distributed computing on the Net and the Web, the next new digital
media will be 'ubiquitous computing' and 'relational processing,' where,
as Mark Weiser says: 'many computers will share each of us.'8 The tech
hype spins out like this:

The third wave of computing is that of ubiquitous computing, whose
cross-over point with personal computing will be around 2005--2020. The
UC era will have lots of computers sharing each of us. Some of the
computers will be the hundreds we may access in the course of a few
minutes of Internet browsing. Others will be imbedded in walls, chairs,
clothing, light switches, cars, in bodies -- in everything. UC is
fundamentally characterized by the connection of things in the world
with computation. This will take place at many scales, including the
microscopic.

There is much talk today about 'thin clients,' meaning lightweight
Internet access devices costing only a few hundred dollars. But UC will
see the creation of thin servers, costing only tens of dollars or less,
that put a full Internet server into every household appliance and piece
of office equipment. The next generation Internet protocol can address
more than a thousand devices for every atom on the earth's surface. We
will need them all.

The social impact of imbedded computers may be analogous to two other
technologies that have become ubiquitous. The first is writing. The
second is electricity, which surges invisibly through the walls of every
home, office and car.9

With embedded processors and the Web as harbingers, ubiquitous computing
will light up the digital future.

However, what will be the human response when the realization grows that
'many computers share each of us' and that we've become exactly what
McLuhan predicted -- the wired sex organs of the cybermachine allowing
it to fecundate and develop while it reciprocates with increases in
personal wealth'; 'passive servomechanisms' of an externalized central
nervous system; or what Virilio foresaw -- electrooptics as a
parasite/predator boarding the metabolic vehicle of human flesh, from
without and now from within, interfacing every orifice of the human
sensorium with artificial plug-ins, with such intensity that the
artificial environment that is really being monitored and managed is
data flesh itself? In ubiquitous computing, we become figure to the
ground of technology, body environments to the electronic sensorium. The
flip is complete. At Xerox Parc, bodies are digital interfaces.

[Thus, the urgent necessity at Xerox Parc for 'calm technology,' for
making the final interfaces of flesh and machine not frenzied, but 'calm
and comfortable,'10 not a scratch in [the digital eye]{.mark} that
continues to hurt, but a 'calm technology' that attaches itself directly
to human perception, 'engaging both the center and periphery of our
attention, and in fact moving back and forth between the two.'11 As a
logistics, tactics, and strategy for [derealizing human perception in
the age of ubiquitous computing]{.mark}, calm technology has three aims.
The first is to move most actual computing interfaces to the periphery
of human attention. As researchers at Parc like to say,]{.underline}

[**[Things in the periphery]{.mark}** [are attuned]{.mark} to
[by]{.mark} the large portion of our Brains devoted to peripheral
(sensory) processing. Thus the periphery in informing without
overburdening. Second, by recentering something in the periphery we take
control of it (or at least have [the illusion of
control]{.mark}).12]{.underline}

[And finally, by [encalming human perception in]{.mark} this new
ubiquitous experience of being a transmission vector in an array of
[cybernetic data]{.mark}, drowning in the cyber-system, calm technology
'**[puts us at home, in a familiar place]{.mark}**.'13 Calm technology
provides an 'information visualization technique' for home-grown
'locatedness' in the digital world.]{.underline}

Now, I have chosen to bring Xerox Parc's theory of calm technology from
the periphery of digital futures research to the centre of attention
because it is a premonitory sign of the actual electronic war strategy
by which the digital eye seductively, but no less violently, will
colonize human perception. Today, the eye is the key interface. Not only
colonization of the objects of perception without, but an
endocolonization of perception where the epistemology of perception is
broken into and digitally reconstituted by all the Xeroxes of the
digital eye -- questions of the meaning of 'locatedness,' issues of what
constitutes periphery and centre, what is cyber-figure and cyber-ground
in the inverted relationship of the human sensorium and ubiquitous
computing, ocular strategies concerning how to transit perceptual focus
between centre and focus using newly acquired digital information
visualization techniques, cyber-psychoanalytic theories that privilege
this strange, opaque, diffuse ocular state of 'calm perception' for an
era of 'calm technology.' Calm technology is one of the master visual
codes for growing a new digital eye for the biotech millennium.
Prozacing human perception.

What is a counter-epistemology to the calming of human perception in
ubiquitous computing?

In his evocative meditations on the virtual art of Marcel Duchamp,
specifically on Duchamp's Glass, where two mirrors held at right angles
capture in the infinity of their impossible optical regression a
foreshadowing of our own refraction into the dissimulative space of
virtual reality, Jean-François Lyotard spoke of our existence today as a
'hinged experience':14 an electrooptical universe that is multiple,
incongruent, and fully incommensurable, a universe that is all a matter
of 'strang projections,' 'vanishing gateways,' 'partition walls,'
'anamorphoses' -- a hinged universe. Now Lyotard always viewed artistic
vision as a 'transformation matrix' -- foreshadowing a new politics of
incommensurability. Or, as he said:

[But the discovery of incongruences and incommensurabilities, if one
brings it back from the space of the geometrist to that of the citizen,
obliges us to reconsider the most unconscious axioms of political
thought and practice. If you haven't despaired of your life on the
pretext that all justice is lost when incommensurability was lost, if
you haven't gone running to hide your ignoble distress beneath the
nobility of a great signifier capable of restoring this geometry, if, on
the contrary, you think like myself that it's the right moment to render
this geometry totally invalid, to hasten its decay and to invent a
topological justice, well then, you've already discovered what a
Philistine could be doing searching among the little notes and
improvisations of Duchamp: materials, tools, and weapons for a politics
of incommensurables.15]{.underline}

Now, many intellectual nomads have been along this way: David Kristian's
tattooed sound; Steve Gibson's transgenic images of Telebody; Tim Murray
with his theory of 'digital incomposibility,' Kathy Acker with her
writing as a 'transformation matrix' in Pussy: King of Pirates, the new
school of hyper-raw edge mechanix poetry in the Bay area -- visual
incongruities, visual disturbances, -- [all hyper-modern, all [posing
the]{.mark} same [**aesthetic gesture** of a politics of
incommensurability]{.mark} as a way of [refusing to restore]{.mark} the
geometry of [normalized]{.mark} [reason]{.mark} and normalized
sight.]{.underline}

[I emphasize Lyotard's plea for a politics of incommensurability in the
context of Xerox Parc's proposal for the calming of human perception at
the advent of calm technology, because we are suddenly in the midst of
Lyotard's ocular world that we thought we were only theorizing, except
this time [the **visual stakes have been aesthetically
ra**]{.mark}**ised**. As if by a tactic of a preventive first-strike
optical inoculation, the age of ubiquitous computing, with many
computers sharing each of us, suddenly softwires human perception into
an actually existent electronic universe of 'strange projections,'
'vanishing gateways,' 'partition walls,' 'anamorphoses' --]{.underline}
a hinged universe at the interface of flesh and machine -- only to
immediately shut down both the danger and the creativity of this new
ocular region by the electrooptical ideology of calm technology.

The aesthetics of Digital Dirt finds its real political nemesis in calm
technology. Calm technology simultaneously closes the eye of human
percep- tion and opens human flesh to full passive absorption into the
regime of the digital eye. I follow Lyotard: No to the new grand
signifier, No to the new grand ocular policing, No to calm perception
for a calm digital eye; and Yes to Lyotard's thought that 'it's the
right moment to render this geometry totally invalid, to hasten its
decay and to invent a topological justice.' However, unlike Lyotard and
Duchamp, for us this moment, this right moment, is more difficult
because today we do not have to simply highlight missed chances for
incongruities and incommensurables, [but actually have [to seize back
from the optical regime of the digital eye]{.mark} the language of art
[and technology]{.mark} as a 'transformation matrix,' [replete]{.mark}
with [strange projections]{.mark}, electronic voids, virtual gateways,
digital anamorphoses -- a ['**hinged universe' of impossible
perspectives**]{.mark} and 'topological justice' that desperately
requires that its digital future, its ocular future[, its electrooptical
future, be **opened up -- excited -- rather than shut down and
calmed**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

So then, some stories of excited perception -- of hyper-perception.

#### The 1AC is a form of artistic practice that [recodes]{.underline} the question of aesthetics towards the discontinuous, the fragmentary, the uncertain, the reversal. We are the [glitch]{.underline}, the darkness, the [specters]{.underline} hidden within the techo-imaginary of the future that float in the drifts of [codes, history, and media]{.underline} as their intersecting point of evocation and undermining.

outside its **immediate** **historical** **circumstances** and
**always** seeking to **capture** in its **rhythms** the mood of
**accelerate**, **drift**, and **crash**, media theory of this order
[allies itself with]{.mark} a form of [**emergent**
**consciousness**]{.mark} that is **pervasive** in the **digital**
**world**, namely [**figural** **aesthetics**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[With its global gathering of new **media artists**, remix musicians,
**pirate gamers, AI graffiti artists**, anonymous witnesses, and [**code
rebels**, t]{.mark}he emerging order of **figural aesthetics** reveals a
**new order**, a brilliantly hallucinatory order, based on an **art** of
**impossible** **questions** and a **perceptual** **language** as
**precise** as it is **evocative**.]{.underline} Here, [[the
**aesthetic** **imagination** dwells solely on]{.mark} **questions** of
**[incommensurability]{.mark}**]{.underline}: What is the vision of the
clone? [[What is the **affect** of **the** **code**]{.mark}? What is the
**hauntology** of the **avatar**?]{.underline} What is most excluded,
prohibited, by the android? What is the perception of the drone? [[What
are the **aesthetics** of the fold]{.mark}? What, in short, is the
meaning of aesthetics in the age of drift culture?]{.underline} In this
case, [understood as an aesthetic order of]{.underline} (new media) [art
that seeks to enter directly into the circulatory regime of the code,
literally in the **process becoming** itself **symptomatically
energized** by the **vortices** of **data** **flows** and algorithmic
coding]{.underline}, [**figural** **aesthetics** is always multiple in
its **artistic** **expressions**, certainly humanizing, but also
**tragic**, **neutral**, and sometimes cynical.]{.underline} [**No**
**longer** an art of **expression** or **representation**, but
**[art]{.mark}** that **literally** [**catches** the **drift**]{.mark}
of its times [by entering **directly** into the **violent**
**perturbations** of the code-stream]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [a **form**
of [**art** that is **figural**]{.mark} precisely [because it
**registers** **simultaneously**]{.mark} all the [**fatal** **speed**
and **tragic** **intimations**]{.mark} of deprival **implicit** [in
an]{.mark} **increasingly** [technical **reality**.]{.mark} Not
necessarily]{.underline}, then, [a **multimedia** [art]{.mark} that
[**evokes** the **contagious** **energy** of the code]{.mark}, although
that too, but a form of art that stands poised at the
fracture]{.underline} (Duchamp\'s "hinge")2 [of presence and absence,
drawing into itself all the contradictions and complexity and folds of
digital reality itself.]{.underline} Driven by a speed of (aesthetic)
perception that easily exceeds the speed of the code, [[**mobilized** by
a **new way of seeing**]{.mark} that is balanced between in-depth
participation in the]{.underline} (digital) [object of its study and an
incommensurable drawing away from ruling narratives that would capture
it]{.underline}, [and attentive to the fact every artifact of
technological posthumanism]{.underline}, from digital devices to private
autobiography, [is a **possible** **object** of **artistic**
**interest**, [**figural** **aesthetics** **floats** in the drifts of
**codes**]{.mark}, **history**, **video**, and **media** [as
their]{.mark} **intersecting** **point** of evocation and
**[undermining]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Sensitive to fundamental changes
in the order of sense perception, the artistic imagination has always
functioned as a navigator, simultaneously intimate with and at a
critical distance from the digital recoding of the human sensorium.
Consequently, it comes as no surprise that [[the]{.mark} [**first**
**response** to]{.mark} the **[emerging]{.mark}** **complexities** of
[**technological** **posthumanism** is]{.mark} most **definitely**
[**aesthetic** in form]{.mark}. **[Not]{.mark}** a mode of
[**aesthetics** that **remains** at **one**]{.mark}]{.underline} (safe)
[[**remove** from the **technological**]{.mark} **transitioning**
of]{.underline} the question of [the human species-form]{.underline},
[[but the]{.mark} swift [emergence]{.mark} now [of a]{.mark} style
of]{.underline} aesthetics -- [[figural aesthetics]{.underline}]{.mark}
-- [that **enters** directly into the **complexities** of drift
culture.]{.underline} Sometimes, [figural aesthetics adopts the
**language** **of** **design**. It becomes a **rider of the data
storm**, negotiating **new** **pathways** **through** the **radical**
**uncertainty** of the **digital** **future**. At other points,
**figural** **aesthetics** offers profound **meditations** on the
**accident** **of** **technology** by invoking in the **language**
**of** **art** the ancient tradition of lament. **Deliberately**
**challenging** officially prescribed **frameworks** of
**understanding**, **figural** **art** of this order quickly **calls**
**down** upon itself the most severe form of **policing**.]{.underline}
Literally, [the **[framework]{.mark}**]{.underline} of power [[involved
in **securing**]{.mark} **contemporary** [norms of **political**
**intelligibility** is **suspicious** of
**thought**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [particularly of those **artistic**
**articulations** of **remembrance** and **lament** that work to
**undermine** otherwise invisible frameworks of **official**
**interpretation**.]{.underline} Of course, when data slams into the
human condition, the result is not only the swift eradication of
familiar landmarks in understanding the here, there, and everywhere of
social intelligibility, but the rapid rise to prominence of [new forms
of **figural** **art**]{.underline} -- mobile, augmented, remix, scanner
-- that in both form and content reflect the shape of the unfolding
future and, in that fatal reflection, [render that **future**
**uncertain** and **truly** **enigmatic**.]{.underline} And how could it
be otherwise when the earliest signs of the coming of the posthuman
allude to the surfacing of body futures that are multiple: sometimes
enhanced data bodies, but also bodies that have gone off-grid, bodies
colonized by mono-data, bodies circulating in the digital debris of
spam, spyware, viruses and contagions, and even twisted bodies caught in
the opposing energy flows of the seduction of connectivity and the
negation of relentless digital overexposure. [[**Figural**
**aesthetics** is the **spectral** **eye** of the **posthuman**]{.mark},
that point where **art** **enters** the **order** of **digital**
**being** with such **perceptual** **intensity** that it makes of itself
a **mutating** **sign** of the **collision** of **the** **code**,
**the** **human**, the android, the metallic, and perhaps even of the
**digital** **zombie**. **[Art]{.mark}** of this]{.underline}
(posthuman) [order [**recodes** the **question** of **aesthetics** by
the **creation** of a mode of **perception** that **fully** **opens** to
the discontinuous]{.mark}, the **fragmentary**, [the]{.mark}
[**uncertain**,]{.mark} the **reversal**.]{.underline} [What results is
a form of figural art -- **posthuman** **art** -- that has **no**
**necessary** **medium** of expression precisely because it is
**always** an **art** **of** **the** **intersection**, the
incommensurable, **the** **bifurcation**, the broken code, **the**
**glitch** that **reveals** the **darkness** **within**, the static that
**reflects** the **passage** **of** **pure** **speed**. Art of **this**
**order** is a **haunting** **talisman** of the **posthuman**,
**neither** its **advent** **nor** **termination**, but a form of
**posthuman** **aesthetics** that can **never** **express** anything
external to itself because **figural** **art** **constitutes** in its
**essence** the **uncanny** **meaning** of the **posthuman** **moment**
-- fluid, mobile, folded, combinatorial, transitional.]{.underline}
Consequently, figural aesthetics is an art of motion but also an art of
inertia -- speed and slowness, noise and silence. With its strange
juxtapositions, unexpected folds, fluid intersections, figural art can
be so strangely familiar to us, the earliest inhabitants of the
technological posthuman, because it is an advance outrider of a new form
of perception that is already practiced on a daily basis but nowhere
fully culturally acknowledged. [While most certainly [this]{.mark}
**new** [**aesthetic** **language** seeks to describe what has happened
to the body]{.mark}]{.underline}, consciousness, labor, culture itself
when folded within the cyclotron of computation, [[it]{.mark} also
[brings to the **surface** the **deeper** **ethical** **concerns** of
**society**: the **terrorism of the code**]{.mark}, the revenge-taking
of the failing master narratives, [the **injured** **sensibility** of
**subject** narratives]{.mark} in rapid decline, the [**growing
ressentiment** of the human]{.mark} at its **eclipse** by the
**technological** **posthuman**, the cynical relief of the abject human
at being **unburdened** of its **eschatological** **responsibility** for
being a **coherent** **species**]{.underline} being -- the fatal
embodiment of the will to technology. Lyotard\'s Driftworks announced
the opening themes of figural art: "Here is a course of action: harden,
worsen, accelerate decadence. [**Adopt** **the** **perspective of active
nihilism**, exceed the mere recognition -- be it depressive or admiring
-- of the **destruction** of all **values**.]{.underline} [[Become more
and **more** **incredulous**]{.mark}. [Push **decadence** **further**
still and accept]{.mark}, for instance, [to **destroy** the **belief**
in **truth** **under all its forms**]{.mark}.]{.underline}" [Now that
the **posthuman** **condition** has revealed decadence --
**incredulous**, **excessive** **decadence** -- as the **basic**
**ontology** of **late** **capitalism**, the point of a **[figural
art]{.mark}** that would "harden, worsen**, accelerate decadence**"
would be **precisely** the **reverse**, that is to say, it would [draw
into]{.mark} a **greater [visibility those
intangible]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} but very real, [**impulses** to
**social** **solidarity** and **ethical** **probity**]{.mark} that haunt
the order of the real.]{.underline} So, then, [**figural** **art** is
always a **navigator** **of** **uncertainty** because it
**remains**]{.underline}, above all, [an **explorer**, a **hinge**, a
**fracture**, [in the **midst of the data storm.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The intellectual foundations undergirding modernity have eroded. That we live precariously perched on the apocalyptic edge renders communication itself facile and incoherent. Carving out opportunities for critical space creates the opportunity for revelatory experiences that shatter the contours of our political imagination and gesture toward alternative possibilities.

[Although I would risk the claim that]{.underline} the capitalist view
of the productivity of [violence]{.underline},
[destruction]{.underline}, [and catastrophe may be **shaken by
[accidents]{.mark}** that **[threaten the coherence of the
socio-economic system]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[or certainly the
environmental life support system]{.underline}]{.mark} itself, [[it is
not]{.mark} at all [clear]{.mark} that this is the case and [that
capitalism will reform its practices]{.mark} when it]{.underline} [looks
like the world is about to end]{.underline}. This is because the high
priest of neo-liberal economics, Milton Friedman \[17\], would regard
the total collapse of the socio-economic system in apocalyptic terms, as
an opportunity to re-boot the system in a more successful, more
efficient form, rather than as a wake up to reform the mode of
production in a general sense. In this respect, I think we must remain
cautious of [Virilio\'s]{.underline} \[18\] Augustinian [theory of
apocalyptic hope,]{.underline} which [parallels Girard\'s]{.underline}
\[19\] [view [that the]{.mark} contemporary [world is
balanced]{.mark}]{.underline} somewhere [[between the mimetic war of all
against all and an]{.mark} [apocalyptic turn that will usher in a new
mode of being together]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Žižek \[20\], Badiou
\[21\], and Kroker \[22\] explain, and Virilio knows all too well,
[contemporary [capitalism is itself an apocalyptic world-less
form]{.mark} **[rooted in metaphysics]{.mark}**]{.underline}, science
fiction, [[and]{.mark} the kind of [quasi]{.mark}-theological
[mysticism]{.mark} that Der Derian]{.underline} \[23\] [finds at [the
heart of the]{.mark} American
[military-industrial-media-]{.mark}entertainment
[network]{.mark}]{.underline} and the related project of virtuous war.
As such, and [because we must understand that post-modern capitalism may
well not only survive, but also profit from the end of the world, we
should recognise the importance of Virilio\'s]{.underline} \[24\]
[notions of **critical space**.]{.underline} What this idea captures is
the possibility that **[[we are]{.mark} currently [balanced on the
apocalyptic edge]{.mark} of the socio-economic system]{.underline}**,
[on the line [between violent destruction and the **extinction of
humanity as being-in-the world**, and]{.mark} the turn to a [new
ecological mode of living]{.mark} able to reconcile our identity as
natural, social, and technological beings]{.underline}.

Given this concern for the apocalyptic nature of hyper-modernity, and
Drew Burk\'s \[25\] account of Virilio as the apocalyptic thinker of
revelation, critical distance, and the scenic imagination par
excellence, I want to claim that we [should emphasise the link between
Virilio\'s concept of [critical space]{.mark} and his ideas of the
museum of accidents]{.underline} \[26\] [and more recently the
university of disaster]{.underline}. \[27\] Through these notions [he
[suggests the need to]{.mark} reveal the catastrophic nature of the
empire of speed, to [open]{.mark} up a [space for critical engagement
with our]{.mark} [culture of disaster]{.mark} that is [otherwise
prohibited by the **collapse of knowledge and thought**]{.mark} **[into
the ecstasy of communication and information]{.mark}**]{.underline}
\[28\], [and ultimately to enable the turning or transformation of
global society to a more humane form.]{.underline}

I want to suggest that we should [[regard Virilio\'s
ideas]{.underline}]{.mark} of the museum of accidents \[29\] and the
university of disaster \[30\] [[as]{.mark} attempts to present [a theory
of the institutionalisation of the critique of the]{.mark} globalised
[empire of]{.mark} [speed that may tip the]{.mark} apocalyptic
[balance]{.mark} against the world-less mysticism]{.underline} of
neo-liberal post-modern capitalism [and [towards]{.mark} the
humanitarian demand for [a more liveable world]{.mark} where technology
works for humans, rather than the other way around.]{.underline} Against
what he calls the twilight of place \[31\], which condemns humanity to,
at best, a life on the move and, at worst, the living death of a
disembodied and spectral existence, Virilio shifts into reverse through
the idea of critical space that can institutionalise [[the]{.mark}
Ancient Socratic [call to \'Know Thyself\']{.mark}; such a call
[has]{.mark} been [disappeared by the culture of speed that **leaves no
time for reflection**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [but remains hidden, a kind
of **unconscious supplement**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in our **world of
light speed trajectories and velocities**]{.underline}, [[awaiting the
moment when **time seems to stop** and]{.mark} **[critical thought is
possible once more]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Akin to the Freudian logic of
unearthing the hidden unconscious other side of psychic life,
[Virilio\'s]{.underline} \[32\] [notions of the critical
space]{.underline} of the museum of accidents and the university of
disaster [seek]{.underline}s [to reveal the other side of the modern
commitment to progress and development]{.underline}.

Following Aristotle, who suggested that the accident reveals the
substance and in doing so inspired western thinkers from Nietzsche,
Heidegger, Freud, Deleuze, and Derrida to think through a theory
contrasting the system and its others, [Virilio explicitly takes the
case of the accident and suggests that it has the potential to reveal
the substance or truth of the]{.underline} [modern temptation to
progress, speed, and totality]{.underline} \[33\]. Apart from revealing
this substance, as the violence and destructiveness of modernity,
especially in its hyper-active phase, it may be that what Virilio\'s
\[34\] apocalypse would also reveal would be the need for humanity to
learn a sense of humility. To accept that it is not divine, but rather a
limited earthbound species that cannot live without resistance or
gravity. The paradox of this situation is, of course, that it is
precisely humanity\'s limited nature, the fact that we are not Gods,
that has led us to reach for the skies only to plunge back down to earth
like Icarus, the tragic figure par excellence of Greek mythology.

Like Nietzsche \[35\], who was well aware of humanity\'s tragic nature,
[Virilio knows that we will always try to touch the sky. In]{.underline}
this respect I do not see him in any way as anti-modern, even though it
is possible that his critique of the excessive nature of the empire of
speed may express itself in a form of social and cultural conservatism
that is not easily reconciled with his radical critique of technology.
Instead I believe that [his problematic resides in the hubristic
forgetting of tragedy that has evolved through hyper-modernity and the
need to rehabilitate the Ancient idea of humanity as a tragic creature
of the limit that is made necessary]{.underline} and possible [by the
apocalyptic culture of post-modernism]{.underline}. This culture
simultaneously and paradoxically marks the moment when we run into the
limit of terrestrial time and space and forget about our earthbound
limited nature. In this respect my focus is less on Virilio\'s
conservatism or his desire to restrict humanity; rather I am interested
in what I perceive to be his concern to maintain the experience of the
limit in a global age where we simultaneously inhabit a state of global
fullness and completion and precisely for that reason have no sense of
that truth. It is this paradox, this conflation of the destructive
potential of completed modernity and the total inability of humanity to
understand this condition as a sign of the limitation and potential end
of its own existence, primarily because of its location or immersion in
a vortex of information that screens out critical thought and knowledge,
that forms the basis of Virilio\'s apocalypse and necessitates the
creation of institutions able to think through the end times in order to
pull us back from the brink. Herein resides the meaning of Virilio\'s
\[36\] idea of a politics of the very worst and his notion of the
accident as an inverted miracle able to radically re-orient our relation
to the world and technology.

Virilio\'s Notion of Catastrophic Modernity

For Virilio \[37\] modernity must be understood as a catastrophic epoch
which has led to what he calls a \'toposcopical disaster\' characterised
by humanity\'s inability to properly perceive the phenomenological
reality of the environment that functions as its life support system.
Against this catastrophic condition - which he tells us leads to the
psychopathological condition of the planet man who falls into
megalomania by virtue of his inability to understand his relation to the
totally mediated virtual world that has been condensed to the infinite
density of a singularity by the light speeds of new media technology -
Virilio explains that we need to find a new form of art suitable for
illustrating our condition and illuminating our apocalyptic situation.
\[38\] From this insight I think we can make two points. First, it is
methodologically significant that [[Virilio discusses the redemptive
quality of art, rather than critical theory, because]{.mark} what [this
illustrates]{.mark} is his view [that complex]{.mark} theoretical
[constructions are unlikely to impact]{.mark} upon [a high speed society
where **knowledge and**]{.mark} **[thought have been]{.mark}** more or
less **[destroyed by an excess of information and
communication]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The value of art
is]{.underline},]{.mark} therefore, [[that it makes an
emotional]{.underline}]{.mark}, [rather than cognitive,]{.underline}
[[impression]{.mark} upon the audience **[and causes them to
feel]{.mark}**, rather than necessarily theoretically comprehend their
situation in an epoch where [theoretical comprehension has
been]{.mark}]{.underline}, at best, marginalised, and at worst,
**[[foreclosed by the light speeds of new
technology]{.underline}]{.mark}**. We know that Virilio \[39\]
foregrounds this methodological approach in his work because he has the
tendency to explain the ways in which his own work leaps from idea to
idea without necessarily working out the connections between theories
and concepts. The effect of this procedure is, therefore, to give the
reader first, an impression and second, an invitation to work backwards
through the theoretical connections present in his work. We can, of
course, find a precedent for this approach to critical writing, which is
perfectly symmetrical with the trajectivity of the post-modern empire of
speed, even if it does run the risk of collapsing into the vortex of
information and communication that characterises our mediated world. [We
can compare Virilio\'s thought to the German critical theorists\' notion
of the thought-image, which was similarly meant to oppose the banality
of the culture industry from the inside through the construction of
media-friendly critical bombs]{.underline}. \[40\] In the case of both
the German critical theorists, such as Adorno and Horkheimer (and to a
lesser extent Benjamin), and Virilio, I think [we can,]{.underline}
therefore, [pinpoint a notion of **[political activism,
where]{.mark}**by **[critical writing is]{.mark} itself [an artistic
activity meant to oppose the banality of tech]{.mark}nology [that simply
works for the sake of working]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [and
somehow to spark critical reflection in the minds of the disorientated
and stupefied masses.]{.underline}

As Virilio \[41\] knows very well, the potential problem of this
strategy is that [it is not possible to fight speed with
speed]{.underline}. From the perspective of the Frankfurters, the threat
is that Virilio\'s user friendly critiques may be transformed into
commodities through the process of knowledge exchange on the open
market, thus becoming little more than fantastical representations of
radical critique in a globalised system that has no other. However, my
view is that [there is more to Virilio\'s]{.underline} \[42\] [turn to
critical art than the attempt to simply mimic the dynamism of the empire
of speed]{.underline}, and that it is possible to understand this
strategy in ways that render it perfectly symmetrical with his other
major radical theory, grey ecology \[43\], or the concern with the speed
limit. My view is that what [[Virilio\'s turn]{.mark} to critical art
[seeks to achieve]{.mark} is a connection to the masses caught under the
sign of light speed that is able to lift them out of the endless passage
of events and freeze time, creating [a moment of solitude,]{.mark}
concentration, contemplation, and [reflection]{.mark}, which in other
works he calls **critical space.**]{.underline} \[44\] My thesis is,
therefore, that [it is this critical space of reflection that Virilio
wants to open up in order [to]{.mark} [create the possibility of
apocalyptic transformation]{.mark} and that understanding this strategy
is key to comprehending the meaning of his political
activism]{.underline}.

This point about Virilio\'s activism is important because it shows us
that [his apocalypse is never immediate, but rather relies on the
recognition of the catastrophic nature of modernity]{.underline} that
his work may produce in the audience. It is only at this point that
Virilio\'s apocalypse, where apocalypse refers to a process of
revelation, would truly appear. Herein resides the second point about
the nature of Virilio\'s theory of the value of art for illuminating the
catastrophic nature of contemporary processes of globalisation; although
the catastrophe is always already present, and taking place as we speak,
the apocalypse is not now, and can never be now, without the revelatory
function of representation to tip the balance away from the unthinking
catastrophe of modernity that is endlessly taking place and towards the
critical ecological-phenomenological demand for a new relationship
between humanity, the world, and technology.

The apocalypse resides, therefore, in the moment of unveiling, in the
moment or event when the catastrophe becomes so apparent that it is
impossible for the audience or tele-viewer not to recognise its
representation or presentation in critical art and act upon this
recognition. Since this has not happened yet, and we remain caught up in
the end times where catastrophe is everywhere and apocalypse nowhere, we
might say that we live in the epoch of unrealised catastrophe. This is
because [the true realisation of catastrophe]{.underline}, not the basic
media representation of catastrophic events that is fed to passive
tele-viewers, but rather [[the existential realisation of the
catastrophe taking place now]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the endless
catastrophe pushing humanity and the world to the very edge of
existence, is the apocalypse]{.underline}. [[**This is the true moment
of revelation**, **that would change our relationship to**]{.mark}
**both technology and [the world forever, and demand us to actively
reformulate our way of living in the]{.mark} [world on the basis of that
revelatory experience]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[If this revelatory experience, this apocalyptic moment]{.underline}, is
the objective of Virilio\'s thought, I think that [we should read his
works as a history of the catastrophic nature of modernity,]{.underline}
hyper-modernity, and the emergence of the post-modern moment of
globalisation when [time and space are exhausted and there is nowhere
else to go]{.underline}. [**[As catastrophe piles upon catastrophe in a
totally mediated, totally inter-connected world where everything impacts
upon everything else]{.underline}**, [Virilio\'s]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[45[\] [wager is that we will]{.mark} wake up to the catastrophe of
modernity realised or post-modernity and [change our
situation]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Shifting into reverse, and
considering his now classic Speed and Politics \[46\], Virilio shows how
modernity and the obsession with speed and progress began with the
French Revolution. In his view the Revolution destroyed the immobility
of the feudal universe that had reigned more or less unchanged since
Aristotle considered the idea of the great chain of being, and
inaugurated a society and social form ordered by the principle of
futurity and modernisation. This new society was formed on the basis of
science, reason, technology, and democracy and was eventually meant to
reach its final destination in a utopia of techno-scientific reasoned
virtue. However, as Žižek \[47\] has shown in his essay on
Robespierre\'s famous \'Virtue and Terror\' speech, the revolutionaries,
who Virilio calls dromomaniacs, knew that their new society of speed,
movement, and progress could never succeed without overcoming or simply
crashing through whatever obstacles lay in its path. In this respect
Žižek highlights Robespierre\'s insight that virtue was always bound to
terror, that virtue was in fact impossible without terror, in much the
same way that Virilio foregrounds the terminal relationship between
speed and war, to show how the history of modernity, the epoch of speed,
has always been about the violent overcoming of obstacles and limits
through terrorist ballistic technologies.

This much is evident when we consider what Virilio \[48\] calls pure
war, his term for explaining the thin or even invisible line separating
war from peace in modern society. Consider the principal site of
modernity, modernisation, and speed, the city, which Virilio \[49\]
regards as a site of \'habitable circulation\'. If we think about the
city, which Mumford \[50\] tells us is the originary site of human
sociability and civilization, through the works of the Italian Futurist
artist Umberto Boccioni and the German sociologist Georg Simmel, we
enter a completely different scene to the foundational city painted by
Mumford. In Boccioni\'s The City Rises \[51\] or Simmel\'s The
Metropolis and Mental Life \[52\] we are presented with the image of the
city as a place of enormous energy and vitality, but also abstraction,
alienation, and violence.

In both cases Virilio\'s \[53\] view that the modern city is governed by
a dictatorship of movement is appropriate. There is no resting place, or
hiding place, in either Boccioni or Simmel. Moderns are fatally exposed
to speed and must learn to adjust to the new epoch. While Simmel was, of
course, critical of the new modern city of speed, because of the ways in
which it fostered a culture of distance and estrangement, Boccioni,
perhaps the master Futurist artist, thought that humanity had to evolve
to live with the new speeds of modernity. Hence his classic sculpture,
Unique Forms of Continuity in Space, can in many ways be seen as a
prefiguration of the totalitarian man captured in the writings of Ernst
Jünger \[54\], and critically discussed by Klaus Theweleit \[55\] in his
two volume psychoanalytic study of the proto-Nazi Freikorps
para-military group that terrorised Weimar Germany in the 1920s.

We know that neither Boccioni or Simmel were concerned with war in any
conventional sense; yet that they clearly relate to the modern prophets
of technological war, Marinetti, Jünger, and later the totalitarians,
Hitler and Stalin, whom Arendt \[56\] characterised by their obsession
with movement, dynamism, and the notion of violent progress towards a
pre-defined ideological utopian conclusion, is of central importance.
What this link illuminates is what Virilio \[57\] means by pure war as
the collapse of the relationship between peace and war and the
endo-colonisation of everyday life by the warrior ethos. Despite the
rejection of the violent utopianism of the totalitarians in the wake of
the discovery of the horrors of Auschwitz and the Gulag Archipelago, it
would be wrong to imagine that pure war or the obsession with speed and
movement has in any way left the scene of post-modern liberal society.
As Virilio \[58\] explains, [speed remains the hope or key utopian
principle of the west]{.underline}. He tells us that [movement is the
only law of the modern, hyper-modern, or post-modern]{.underline} [world
and that the **failure to move** is a sign of decay, decline, and
ultimately death]{.underline}.

[That the futurism of speed remains central to life]{.underline} in
western liberal and neo-liberal society [should not surprise us since
the founder of the liberal tradition]{.underline}, Thomas Hobbes
\[59[\], was himself concerned with the movement and the progress of men
through life]{.underline}. [In his political science he imagined society
as smooth Euclidean space populated by atomised men]{.underline} or
precise \'subjectiles\' bound by the rules of the road set out by the
Leviathan and expected to follow these rules on pain of death. For
Hobbes, life was a race, and a struggle for power, where power refers to
the difference between the relative speeds of men. In the context of
this situation, the rule of the Leviathan was meant to legislate against
fatal collisions. These would, in the state of nature, lead to
catastrophic accidents between men, resulting in the end of one of their
trajectories through life, immobility, and as a consequence, death
\[60\].

Beyond Virilio\'s \[61\] location of the emergence of modernity, the
epoch of speed, in the event of the French Revolution, it may well be
that we should also think about the ways in which Hobbes\' theory of the
state as traffic cop from the mid-17th century also contributed to the
origin of the new society of movement, dynamism, and progress. Here, we
may also consider how Hobbes\' work built upon the new physics of
Galileo and the theory of inertia that posited a universal law of
movement and undermined the Aristotelian orthodoxy that imagined a
universe of order, stasis, and organisation, and regarded all movement
as progress towards this natural end point. Given the radical break
between the ancient-medieval physics based upon Aristotle\'s thought and
Galileo\'s new modern paradigm that Hobbes took as a model of the
endless dynamism of early capitalist society, it is possible to see the
French Revolutionary break, which ushered in the society of the epoch of
totalitarianism, as an attempt to rediscover the ancient notion of a
telos that the Spartans and Plato had sought to defend against
Herodotus\' \[62\] notion of history, and combat the revolutionary
conditions later represented by Boccioni and Simmel.

In this way, it is possible to construct an historical time-line
explaining the emergence of the current catastrophic empire of speed
that Virilio believes has reached its limit and started to burn out
under conditions of globalisation. This time-line would run from the
historical destruction of Sparta and Plato\'s related utopian city
outlined in The Republic \[63\], evolve through Aristotle\'s theory of
movement towards natural ends, take in the destruction of Aristotle\'s
theory by Galileo and the new modern physics and Hobbes\' political
science of society as a race, before reaching Marx and the
anti-capitalist reaction to the new violent society of speed. This
anti-capitalist turn may in turn be related to the totalitarian attempts
to re-discover a modernist version of the ancient utopia of stasis,
leading finally to a consideration of the rise of post-modern
neo-liberal capitalism in the wake of the collapse of the
totalitarianisms that has liberated speed from all ideas of limitation.

The central point about the end of this time-line is, of course, that
the post-modern neo-liberal liberation of speed from all ideas of
limitation, where ideas of limitation refer to either utopian ends or
social speed limits such as trade regulations meant to govern the
movement of capital, is evidence of the hubris and the forgetting of
tragedy that Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Virilio all see as the core
problematic of the modern society of nihilism, technology, and speed
\[64\]. In each case I think it is possible to argue that [Nietzsche and
Heidegger, and now Virilio, recognise that the inability of humanity to
appreciate the necessary phenomenological resistance of the world upon
its movement and speed will produce catastrophic consequences in the
form of the emergence of a last man bored by a technological world that
he can no longer relate to and that completely prohibits his continued
movement through space]{.underline}. This is, of course, the famous
theory of inertia that Virilio \[65\] employs to show how the empire of
speed has started to collapse into a society of immobility and stasis
characterised by walls, borders, camps, and prisons that he generalises
through the ideas of global foreclosure, incarceration, and lock down.

In this new global crash culture, where the ideology of global
capitalism talks about freedom of movement and works off the idea that
increased proximity in a society where it is impossible to evade the
other will lead to more love, sharing, and community, Virilio\'s \[66\]
point is that reality is defined by surveillance, suspicion, paranoia,
security, hatred, petty jealousy, revulsion towards the other, and
ultimately pure war. This, then, is the catastrophe of the empire of
speed without limits. This is the catastrophe awaiting a revelatory
moment to transform it into an apocalyptic event that may enable us to
enact radical, revolutionary, change. [The challenge
remains]{.underline}, of course, [to find some way to produce this
apocalyptic moment, to produce this moment of revelation, through
artistic endeavour and critical thought in a society of speed where
everything is reduced to the status of information, communication, and
commodity to be exchanged and passed on]{.underline}. In other words,
there is no apocalyptic moment in the empire of speed because the empire
of speed is defined by what we might variously call following Kroker
\[67\] and Wilson \[68\] post-modern, virtual, hyper, or
supercapitalism.

[In the hyper-capitalist world, if we choose to adopt Kroker\'s name for
the new form of high speed]{.underline}, high tech, totally virtual
capitalism, there is no telos, [[there is no apocalyptic end]{.mark}, no
fatal moment of collapse, since]{.underline}, as Wilson \[69\] points
out, [[death is distributed across the system]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
this vision of the new capitalist world, [[mortality invades every
aspect of life in the form]{.mark} of a death drive that compares to
Virilio\'s concept of [pure war]{.mark}]{.underline} \[70\] which shows
how **[[war is no longer contained in a discrete event, but rather
exists everywhere, nowhere, and is at the same time never and always
on]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For Virilio \[71\] **[this death drive is
[explained by America\'s attachment to the idea of the
frontier]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, or]{.mark} what he calls, citing
Jackson, the frontier effect, which [has led the land of the free
towards a form of nihilism set on the destruction of the environment for
the sake of development]{.underline}, modernisation, progress, and
creation of what Deleuze and Guattari \[72\] call smooth space. That is
to say that **[[the American determination to
conquer]{.underline}]{.mark}** or overcome obstacles, to create smooth
space suitable for the speed of movement for capital and human flows, in
many respects **[[reproduces Hobbes\' capitalist metaphysics of
legalised movement]{.underline}]{.mark}** in real space. [It is this
innovation that transforms the phenomenological world of embodied
experience into a metaphysical or virtual abstraction that
humans]{.underline}, or perhaps we should say those post-humans plugged
into the network society, [experience through inter-face with
technology]{.underline}. Virilio\'s \[73\] America, the land of
Hobbesian materialist metaphysics realised, is for this reason
comparable to Baudrillard\'s \[74\] Nietzschean land of fascinated
banality. It exists as a land of deserts, a featureless landscape, a
smooth Euclidean space, that has come to define post-modern
globalisation as a catastrophic space awaiting the arrival of its
apocalypse.

What is more is that we know that the apocalypse is on the American
mind. Consider the born again Christian fundamentalists. They understand
the endless war in the Middle East, the lands of deserts, Iraq, the
birth place of human culture and civilization, and Armageddon, the site
of the final battle between the forces of good and evil, as the scene of
the coming apocalypse where the saved will be separated from the damned
and the world will learn what America already knows, that it is the land
of God. Again we can discern the strange virtualisation of the world,
which Virilio \[75\] understands as characteristic of the light speeds
of globalisation, where metaphysics and theology stand in for politics,
define the direction of our world, and set the scene for an apocalyptic
moment that will transform the basic co-ordinates of human reality.
Unfortunately, the contemporary American apocalypse, which updates
Winthrop\'s theory of the city upon the hill in popular and official
culture ranging from Tim LaHaye\'s Left Behind \[76\] books to the Bush
regime\'s PNAC, is not the apocalypse imagined by Virilio \[77\].
Whereas his theory suggests creating speed limits or a \'political
economy of speed\' in order to enable humans to live together in the
world, [[the American]{.mark} vision of the [apocalypse is about
destroying what little environmental resistance there is left in the
world in order to completely liberate humanity from its reliance on
natural life support systems.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In practical terms [this is,]{.underline} of course, [about spreading
the American way, and]{.underline} perhaps [military]{.underline},
economic, and cultural [imperialism]{.underline}, but what is important
about Virilio\'s vision is that it enables us to understand that
**[[behind the commitment to practical principles of freedom]{.mark},
individualism, [democracy, capitalism, and technology resides a
metaphysical imperative to salvation through
virtualisation]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Paraphrasing Virilio
paraphrasing Heidegger who noted that [technology]{.underline} cannot be
understood technologically but rather [must be thought
metaphysically]{.underline}, it may be the case that [we cannot
understand the American-led process of globalisation politically or
economically, but instead must think]{.underline} about it
[metaphysically]{.underline} in terms of speed and the death drive
towards virtuality. This view, which describes the way Virilio \[78\]
understands processes of globalisation and the creation of the
dromosphere is certainly supported by [Der Derian\'s]{.underline} \[79\]
[theory of virtuous war.]{.underline} Der Derian\'s theory [explains a
mode of pure war, slimmed down in terms of its understanding
of]{.underline} [political complexity in order to meet the needs of
speed]{.underline}, so that the world is divided along the lines of Carl
Schmitt\'s \[80\] violent friend / foe dichotomy where the virtuous
chosen people face off against the evil others who are set to burn in
Hell in an apocalyptic fight to the death, and transformed into a media
abstraction by high technology, [which virtualises reality, making the
environment subordinate to the smooth spaces of the map]{.underline}.
For Der Derian \[81\], [America]{.underline}, the land of apocalyptic
virtuous war, [[the mode of pure war]{.mark} that fuses a theological
belief in]{.underline} [virtue with a high tech commitment to
virtuality, [was always fated to take this]{.mark} road]{.underline}.
[It was]{.underline}, after all, [named after Amerigo Vespucci, the
great cartographer-explorer, and has always been the land of maps and
the refusal of the world]{.underline}.

#### Debates about the details of [American military posture]{.underline} may seem like benign reform within broader imperialist politics, [but]{.underline} the [underlying metaphysics]{.underline} of American culture and society [ensures]{.underline} that the political energy produced can only be expressed as [exclusionary ressentiment]{.underline} or [nihilist instrumental activism]{.underline}

Yet for all its outward materialist accomplishments, [[the]{.mark}
**underlying [metaphysics of the American]{.mark} expression of the
[will cannot]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in the end, [**[be
denied]{.mark}**.]{.underline} At some indefinable point in its cultural
history, [possibly [bored with its accomplishments]{.mark}, fatigued
with its obligations,]{.underline} perhaps [contemptuous of the ease
with which it has conquered a colony and then an empire, [the]{.mark}
American [will **inevitably folds back on itself.**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[Thus begins the era of soft decadence when the will,
[dispensing]{.mark} with extrinsic [objects as]{.mark} ultimately
[unsatisfactory]{.mark} forms of satisfaction, **begins to feed on
itself**]{.underline}. Literally, [America begins to make itself sick
[as a way of **energizing the next phase of its** ]{.mark}**historical
[project]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While the American will in its
political infancy is nourished by the language of expanding capital \--
the aggressive construction of a coldly functional empire of social,
economic, cultural and political power \-- the fully mature expression
of the American will does just the opposite. [In these desolate,
skittish days at the end of empire, American power feeds on the
eschatology of postmodern phantasms]{.underline}: the death of the
social, the end of politics, the virtualization of capital, the
disappearance of culture. Reality shows on television are practical
substitutes for social capital. Dense networks of expressways linking
gated suburbs to downtown financial skyscrapers represent the
architectural remainder of urban capital. Breast augmentation as the
leading present by parents to graduating high school women constitutes
the real language of body capital. Evangelical preachers, stock
manipulators, and powerful vested interests feeding on the \"common\"
body of the government perfectly express the death of politics as itself
a way of renewing the language of power. [While conservative political
rhetoric appeals to the unity of American community and progressive
thought continues to dream of social justice, [the real driving force of
American]{.mark} popular [culture champions the **death of the
social.**]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[Exclusionary politics, political
scapegoating]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[collective anger]{.mark}
directed [against the weak]{.mark}]{.underline}**, posses of
middle-class self-described \"**[vigilantes\" on the Arizona border with
Mexico]{.underline}**, drinking rates among some high school students
declining because they are reported as spending more time popping
prescription pills from their parents\' medicine cabinets, television
news of mass outbreaks of syphilis among the children of Baptists in
Atlanta suburbs, newspaper chronicles of monster homes, abandoned
families, and vacant relationships. A pleasure dome and a torture
chamber, the Body Upon a Hill increasingly takes delight in its own
humiliation. Its mass entertainment from CSI to the galaxy of reality
shows can be death-oriented because in its last decadent phase power
always prefers to speak in the language of thanatos. With a thin veneer
of piety covering an inner reality of political cynicism, scenes of
torture, death, accidents, mass plague, natural catastrophes are
transformed into entertainment spectacles. In the mass media, false
prophets abound while false gods are proclaimed just before being
debunked. **[[In]{.mark} its [foreign policy]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[[America throws off the]{.mark} legitimating [language of democratic
freedom]{.mark}, [revealing itself to be a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[**cold-eyed will to power**]{.mark}, [subordinating when]{.mark}
necessary the (domestic) rhetoric of freedom and [democracy]{.mark}
to]{.underline} [doing what[\'s necessary to preserve]{.mark} an
increasingly hegemonic [world empire]{.mark}]{.underline}. In its
domestic policy, the leaders of the Republic encourage its population to
make a media spectacle of the spirit of negation within. [[Violence
becomes]{.mark} the [essential]{.mark} moment of rapture in the **last
decadent phase of American empire**, with panic fear and panic deflation
as oscillating moments in the public mind.]{.underline} Or [perhaps
something more psychologically complex as the American boundary
condition: a strange combination of activism and]{.underline} [panic
fear, transformation and negation.]{.underline} Which explains why, for
example, there can be such violent counter-reactions against any
breaches of the closed boundaries of the American covenant. This is a
political system wound up so tightly in a twin logic of violence and
negation that the **[slightest [hint of catastrophe]{.mark} threatens to
[draw out]{.mark} the [panic]{.mark} fear within]{.underline}**. [[Long
before the projection of American]{.underline} [power harvests the world
in the pursuit of its imperial ambitions]{.underline},]{.mark} the terms
of the original Puritan covenant \-- codified by the language of the
American Constitution and sanctified by the official rhetoric of the
Civil War as sacrificial violence in the interests of an indivisible
Union \-- specify that the American self will be a sacrificial offering
\-- a will and nothing but a will. Later, during the decadent days of
empire, when the strategic interests of American power have been
achieved and the middle-class population assured of the practical
successes of the high-intensity consumer marketplace, it is difficult to
rearticulate the original animating vision of the burning will that is
the essence of American exceptionalism. More profoundly a metaphysical
rather than a narrowly political rupture with its European origins, what
really migrated with Puritans first, and waves of immigrants later, was
a fundamentally new expression of the language of the will \-- a will to
survive, to create, to conquer, to dominate \-- which carried in its
path both a new form of (technical) knowledge as power as much as a new
form of (crusading) emotion motivated by unbending determination
American-style. The Double Helix A transformation matrix, the dominant
American cultural pattern holds direct opposites in creative tension.
This is the source of its fierce internal political debates, its
messianic militarism, its scientific creativity, its dynamic capitalist
experimentation, its often visionary art. Simultaneously pious and
cynical, philanthropic and war-like, manipulative and generous,
proselytizing and fearful, American culture intensifies extremes and
laughs away the difference. Long before the science of evolutionary
biology envisioned the model of the \"double helix\" as the basic
building block of human life, American culture emerged full-blown as a
society of twisted strands. Refusing to be enframed by the frozen
binaries of Enlightenment logic, blasting away the philosophical
obstructions between a vengeful god and an optimistic science, always in
creative tension, always on the move towards the next frontier, the
discourse of technology and the American mind was a brilliant scientific
idea first experienced as a daring political project. For example, while
the biological model of the double helix could be brilliantly proposed
fifty years ago as the basic (DNA) building block of all life, perhaps
in a strange case of science lagging behind life, Crick and Watson\'s
discovery (with the unacknowledged, but indispensable X-ray photography
by Rosalind Franklin) was anticipated by the political history and
cultural logic of the United States. The American Republic of Bio-Power
Sometimes, scientific consciousness articulates a vision of the future
which, while ostensibly emergent from the physical universe actually
represents a fantastic crystallization of a ruling idea, that had until
that point been suspended in the cultural atmosphere. Like an intangible
idea, floating everywhere, expressible nowhere, the double helix could
perhaps be received with such instant global acclaim because it gave
voice to a dynamic cultural representation which until that moment was
unrecognized as the \"building block\" of modern (American) culture. In
the same way that Lewis Mumford could note that the industrial model of
the factory was anticipated by medieval practices of the monastery with
its strict division of time, disciplining of labor, and specialization
of work function,\[4\] so too the biological model of the double helix
was anticipated by the singular way of being that is American identity.
Could it be that what is most exceptional about American exceptionalism
is that this was a culture which, from its inception, had somehow
stumbled upon the language of biology as its ruling metaphysic? In this
case, we might conclude that while Europe could rightfully be the
originating continent of physics, the United States would be the culture
born under the sign of genetic biology. When Michel Foucault spoke so
eloquently about the movement from \"power over death\" to \"power over
life\" as the essence of power/knowledge, he might well have been
rehearsing in his thought the political creed of the United States:
namely that this would be a culture where power would wager itself on
the invention of a distinctive style of life itself, what is described
colloquially, not without a certain sense of national pride, as the
\"American way of life.\" The passionate combination first of Puritan
missionary consciousness and scientific experimentalism, and later of
mass consumption and electronic gadgets, that would come to characterize
the American eruption in an otherwise hostile, if not indifferent, world
found its formula, and appropriately so, in the famous \"Declaration of
(Technological) Independence\" with its bio-political rhetoric of
\"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" What finally appeared in
the 20th century language of genetic biology as the famous image of the
double helix \-- two twisting strands of nucleotides, strictly
anti-parallel, connected by four base pairings \-- is, I believe, but a
scientific expression of a bio-political revolution that occurred much
earlier with the founding of the American republic. Here, like a
cultural precession of the scientific imagination of biotechnology, the
dominant pattern of American discourse is structured in the form of a
double helix whereby two great curving strands of cosmology \--
faith-based religion and scientifically authorized reason \-- follow a
twisting, spiraling path from past to future: co-present, bound together
in creative tension, decidedly not binaries, determining in their
oppositions and continuities the specific codes of American political
culture. Always running anti-parallel to one another (religion versus
science, liberalism versus conservatism, individualism versus
collectivity, nature versus culture, faith versus reason), the genetic
memory of American discourse is connected by four base pairs: economy,
politics, society, and culture. Like DNA, the base pairs of American
culture \-- its seductive model of political economy, social logic,
media networks, and cultural values \-- can be easily clipped and
transplanted into colonized (alien) bodies. It was not for nothing that
Marshall McLuhan described the United States as the \"world
environment.\" With a strikingly original \"building block\" of
political life (the constitutional theory of the American Republic),
genetic social memory (the \"American dream\"), great twisting strands
of thought, and clashing ideological currents which run deep and always
run anti-parallel, America was fated by its origins in genetic logic to
be the ascendant ruling empire of the 21st century[. More than its own
imperial leadership may suspect, [America was]{.mark} literally
[engineered for world power from its inception]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
this continental nation, in this global empire, a dynamic genetic idea
\-- the [building blocks of life itself as twisting strands of great
codes, anti-parallel, connected by base pairs in constant motion \--
somehow jumped from the sphere of biology to the world of political
theory. Imprinting itself deeply in the language of American identity,
arming itself with the religious fervor of the American dream,
structuring a whole society with its biological rhythms, the double
helix finds in the American Republic a way of coding that which is most
vital, most powerful, most eschatological into a resilient, **always
expanding, body of (imperial) politics**.]{.underline} As a nation the
history of which begins not only with a fateful rupture with Europe but
with a dynamic will to create a new society out of the twisting strands
of fierce religious conviction and equally determined pilgrim energy, we
are dealing here with the sudden eruption in the \"New World\" of an
evolutionary break in the building blocks of (European) political and
social life. Breaking with the fetters of monarchy, refusing the
land-based fatalism of feudalism, placing its confidence in the bible
and the axe, pushing westward, then global, then galactic, towards an
unattainable imagination of the American spirit, the \"New Republic\" is
possessed by the language of bio-politics. Ostensibly, we are dealing
here with the social construction of American identity, the political
constitution of mixed government combining executive, legislative and
judicial powers in equal, measured proportions, the ideological
formation of the American colonizing project from \"Manifest Destiny\"
to \"Redemptive Empire,\" and the invention of a style of capitalist
initiative that is as creative, inventive, and transformative in its
entrepreneurial energy as it is harsh, cold and calculating in its drive
to quarterly profitability. All this may be true, but still there is
something else, more subliminal, harder to detect, practically invisible
because it is so omnipresent; and that is, the actual genetic
constitution of the sustaining spirit of America as a way of being.
Here, each person, each identity, each animating political idea, each
cultural image, each entrepreneurial project, each cybernetic vision
will either be a twisted strand containing clashing, brilliantly
anti-parallel possibilities, or, as Puritan futurists declaimed: \"it
would perish from the face of this good earth.\" [**[Catastrophe and
rapture are the twisted song-lines of American
being]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Catastrophe and Rapture Who could have
conceived of a society which would structure principles for its own
undermining, for itself as a brilliantly creative accident \-- always
about to happen, always happening, always in the process of being
redeemed \-- for the auto-destruction of any tendency towards permanent
stability, into its deepest constitutional principles? It\'s one thing
to speak with awed reverence at the supposedly flawed Kantian marvel
that is the United States where the (modernist) vision of universal
human community of freely acting citizens invested with inalienable
natural rights is somehow held to be threatened by faith-based, bible
belt political insurgencies running straight from the pulpit to the
White House, from Fox News to the deepest subjectivity of the
inhabitants of the new middle class gated communities of this good
(suburban) land. But it\'s quite something else, when taking off the
blinkers of conventional modernism, to realize that with regard to the
question of American being, something genuinely unique is happening
here, that this is one culture which is structured by a very singular
social history, namely that the only national constant in American
history \-- economic, political, social and cultural \-- is the
capitalist equivalent of Maoist \"permanent revolution.\" Call it what
you will \-- Schumpeter\'s principle of \"creative destruction, \"
Reagan\'s \"New Morning for America,\" Microsoft\'s competitive software
scorched earth policy symbolized by its \"Windows on the World,\" the
tabloids\' daily spectacle of the dramatic burnout and eventual
redemption of celebrity icons, or small business entrepreneurs who get
up everyday with gritty dreams and mission statements to deconstruct,
derail, and devolve what has gone before in order to reconstruct,
realign and repurpose enterprise economy into something absolutely new,
absolutely profitable. American rhetoric might wear the symbolic
garments of Kantian universal freedom to the altar of political
respectability in the community of (democratic) nations, but the essence
of American identity lies elsewhere, precisely in the almost ecstatic
collective pleasure taken in accidenting the future, crash-testing the
economy, accelerating the body, abandoning culture, evacuating the
social, harvesting the brain by new sciences of neuro-genetics,
vicariously sharing in the rise and fall of celebrity icons. Fear Factor
and Entertainment Tonight are not just prime-time TV shows: they also
capture something of the element of radical deconstruction central to
the American geist. The spirit of permanent revolution at the heart of
American identity might be explained away by Rene Girard\'s concept of
sacrificial violence \-- namely that this is one culture which, perhaps
exhausted with sacrificial rituals carried on at the (media) edges of
its colonial borders, finally makes a sacrificial wasteland of itself,
finding in the moment of sacrificial expenditure the real social capital
of an advanced technoculture dying of its own boredom. But perhaps there
is something about American identity that is post-Girard, that the
ecstasy of sacrificial expenditure \-- the insatiable drive to
transform, undermine, innovate, create, destroy \-- is not the empty
symbolic ritual of an exhausted culture which desperately requires
sacrifices (of always accidental others) as a means of internal moral
cohesion, but the essential genetic logic of its historical drive to
empire. This dynamic fusion of sacrificial logic and natural rights into
the same political body, investing American identity, business, war,
culture, knowledge, media with the twisted strands of different futures
\-- order and chaos \-- always anti-parallel, always threatening to
implode, to reconfigure, to instantly field-morph into a radical change
of state is the essential creative energy driving the American dream.
Neither exclusively political nor biological, American being is born
bio-political. Here the future always accidents itself \--
destabilizing, conflagrating, deconstructing \-- in order to give rise
to something greater: that is its energy, its creativity, its
innovativeness, its undeniable seduction, its dark charisma. Reluctant
to slow down sufficiently to develop a stable (modernist) Freudian ego,
this is one culture which operates at the speed of light between a
full-octane id and an aggressive cultural superego. Three Twisted
Strands USA: An Open, Closed or Flat Universe? After the Big Bang
precipitated by the meeting of covenant theology and the spirit of
technological innovation in the American mind, what is the future of the
United States? Is it an open universe rushing outwards in ever expanding
concentric circles, radiating its implosive energy at the speed of
light, burning up its material base until at some point in the
indefinite future it will be left floating among the planets as an empty
remainder of that which once was the leading 21st century empire of
spacetime? Or is it a closed universe violently collapsing into itself,
the infinite curvature of its spacetime fabric compressing into the
dense, dark material of a black hole from which no light can escape? Or
is the American future that of a flat universe with no real expansion
nor necessary contraction, only an indefinite struggle between
inflationary and deflationary forces, a prolonged political stalemate
punctuated by violent event-horizons. Understood as an open universe,
[the secret of American power is that it always seeks to inflate beyond
its controlling codes. The [military projection]{.mark} of the American
will to empire by sea, land and air [always exceeds the]{.mark} more
[constrained political vision of the founding]{.mark} constitutional
[order]{.mark}]{.underline}. The political economy of advanced
capitalism that has come to be known as the logic of globalization is
always functionally bankrupt, incorporating a permanent liquidity crisis
of over-indebtedness as its necessary motive. The greater the expansion
of American influence off-shore, the more severe the internal
legitimation crisis undermining American authority. The more universal
the declaration of American values, the more intense the domestic debate
concerning the ends of American political morality. In its expansive,
inflationary phase, [the fabric of American culture [expands to
**consume the universe**]{.mark}, [investing societies]{.mark} seemingly
everywhere [with a unitary fabric of]{.mark}]{.underline} (American)
[[spacetime linking together **imperial power**, **capitalist
profitability**,]{.mark} media influence [and **messianic
vision**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Viewed as a closed universe, American
culture is in the process of violently collapsing into itself, like a
dead and dying star attracting into its dense, twisting spiral all the
passing material of the social universe. Here, the language of
redemptive empire can be revived as a way of signaling the swift
contraction of the American experiment into its base elements of
physical power, primitive capitalism, crusading morality, and imposed
influence. Massively deflationary, inward looking, mistrustful of
outsiders, increasingly paranoid about breaches of its (political)
bodily boundaries, America as a closed universe has only one certain
future. When the liquid growth of the symbolic media of power, money,
influence and values are forced to contract towards their controlling
codes, a critical tipping-point is quickly achieved. Here, America
becomes a quantum singularity: a crushing density of political energy
around which light-waves from other stars are forced to bend,
disappearing into such an infinite immensity of darkness that America
henceforth will only be known at second-hand by the astronomical signs
of what is missing when other planets cross between outside observers
and its violent event-horizon. Envisioned as a flat universe, America is
a culture of twisted strands struggling to stabilize clashing pressures
towards full (political) inflation and total (cultural) deflation.
Possessing neither the pure energy of an open universe or the dense
matter of a closed universe, the flat universe of America is something
different. It is that moving point where the centripetal energies of an
expanding (political) universe fold back into centrifugal matter of a
deflationary (economic) culture to create an event-horizon that is known
as the American singularity. Positioned on the outer edge of the spiral,
marking a threshold between the black hole of the American religious
past and the white hole of the American technological future, the
American singularity is a warp hole between history and the present.
Enter the American singularity, fully immerse yourself in the fusion of
closed universe covenant theology and open universe technological
innovation that is the American field of spacetime today, and you will
find yourself instantly tunneling between religious time and
technological space. Following the lessons of quantum physics which hold
that every quantum singularity is accompanied by an event-horizon, could
it be that America in all of its violence and seduction is the unique
event-horizon which emerges from the convergence of covenant belief and
creative technology, in North America first, in world history later, and
perhaps in the deep space explorations, migrations and colonizations of
the future? The New Puritans: Twisted Strands Take Root on American Soil
Harvard University, which celebrated its 350th anniversary in 1986, is
the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. Founded
16 years after the arrival of the Pilgrims at Plymouth, the University
has grown from nine students with a single Master to an enrollment of
some 18,800 degree candidates, including undergraduates and students in
10 graduate and professional schools. Six presidents of the United
States \-- John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Theodore and Franklin Delano
Roosevelt, Rutherford B. Hayes, and John Fitzgerald Kennedy \-- were
graduates of Harvard. Harvard College was established in 1636 by vote of
the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and was
named for its first benefactor, John Harvard of Charlestown, a young
minister who, upon his death in 1638, left his library and half his
estate to the new institution. During its early years, the College
offered a classic academic course based on the English university model
but consistent with the prevailing Puritan philosophy of the first
colonists. Although many of its early graduates became ministers in
Puritan congregations throughout New England, the College was never
formally affiliated with a specific religious denomination. An early
brochure, published in 1643, justified the College\'s existence: \"To
advance Learning and perpetuate it to Posterity; dreading to leave an
illiterate Ministry to the Churches.\" \[5\] While the mythic Puritan
story of the \'first encounter\' at Plymouth Rock is a familiar part of
the American foundational narrative, what is less remarked, but of
probably greater lasting cultural importance, is that there was actually
a second \'first encounter\' in American discourse: this time not
between Puritans and indigenous peoples, but between faith and reason,
between Puritan missionary consciousness so necessary to the immediate
development of born again ideology in the American mind and scientific
reason so vital to its future ideology of technological liberalism, and
all this within the famous brick walls and ivy-leafed square of Harvard
University. Here the missionary zeal, disciplinary energies, and
crusading spirit of the Puritan moment would meet up with a style of
(Enlightenment) thought which in its rationality, pragmatism, and
pluralism would soon seemingly best it to become the official
intellectual core of the American mind. There the story might have ended
except for one curious eventuality. What emerged as the liberal side of
the American mind was, I believe, always deeply touched by American
covenant theology. God is not a passive witness to the unfolding story
of American power, technology, and liberalism, but a co-present,
anti-parallel, and much called upon, active partner. Definitely
post-Enlightenment in its ruling scientific epistemologies and creative
technological innovations, America is equally, and this most definitely,
pre-Enlightenment in its popularly subscribed messianic vision. Here the
high tech marvels of the 21st century are always in the way of hurrying
back to resolve the original terms of the 17th century Puritan covenant.
American culture was born with a (covenant) debt which it can never
satisfy, and on behalf of which it is fated to be that most singular of
all nations: simultaneously part-quantum/part-confessional. Now I do not
mean this in a reductive sense implying either the subordination of the
Puritan outlook to the world-vision inspiring the American liberal
imagination or, for that matter, the reduction of technological
liberalism to its Puritan foundations. America has always had about it
the barely discernable hint of enigma: namely that what would set it
apart as a colonial, then national, and now empire, project, is that
this would be a culture of twisted strands: the twisting together in an
ascending spiral of two conflicting motivations \-- religious and
secular, puritan and scientific, born again and pragmatic \-- which,
taken together, constitute the core code of what for some is the rapture
of the American dream, but for others the apocalypse of American
imperialism. Long before 20th century quantum physics would envision the
physical universe as always composed of opposite changes of state \-- a
world of both/and, not either/or \-- American political reality would
build, from its Puritan origins in the 17th century to the crusading
military spectacles of the 21st century \-- a society, culture, and
political economy firmly based on the basic quantum principle that in
life, as in science, only contradictions are true, that the ineluctable
differences between religion and science confirm their necessary
partnership in the deepest (political) affairs of the American mind. So
then, to return to the original question concerning the Puritan roots of
Harvard University. The question of technology and the American mind
begins with what, at first, appears to be a historical curiosity, but
upon further reflection reveals itself to be a cultural puzzle, then a
still unresolved political predicament. The historical curiosity is
this: What explains the fact that the Massachusetts Bay Company \-- the
emblematic sponsor of crusading, disciplinary Puritanism, shortly after
the so-called \"First Encounter\" at Plymouth Rock also established
Harvard University, now in its own publicity terms the \"oldest
corporation\" in the New World. The cultural puzzle: Is the genealogical
relationship between Harvard University, widely viewed as the
intellectual spearhead of what might be viewed as technological
liberalism in the United Sates, and the missionary spirit of Puritanism
simply a historical coincidence \-- what might be called a discursive
situation in which the religious foundations of American knowledge
migrated with the slow passage of time into a style of thought \--
rational, experimental, pragmatic \-- in short, scientific? Or could
this meeting of the religious foundations of the American Republic and
the epistemological model grounding its scientific future represent
something more world-historical, more metaphysically convulsive, in its
cultural importance? Was this meeting of Puritan faith and liberal
thought a great metaphysical fusion of the divided European will? Were
what might be called the Harvard Puritans a New World solution to a
metaphysical problem which, while it may have had its historical origins
in a European culture marked by the absolutist wars of religion and the
creative, speculative dreams of the Renaissance, could not be solved
within the closed orbit of European thought? And the political
predicament? [Once having come to full maturity as the historical
embodiment, not only of a new (republican) political idea but, more
importantly, of a new expression of the metaphysics of the will \--
technology and the American mind \-- [what will impede the]{.mark}
present [American experiment in playing out the]{.mark} inevitable
[end-point of that story]{.mark}]{.underline}, what Heidegger described
as \"**[[completed nihilism]{.underline}]{.mark}**\"? In seeking to
understand the question of technology and the American mind, one fact is
dramatically clear. Namely, that **[[what]{.mark} truly [distinguishes
American thought]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [what really lies at the roots
of American exceptionalism, is that this [is not]{.mark}, and never was,
[a traditional European story of war]{.mark}ring binaries]{.underline}
\-- faith versus reason \-- [[but a complicated fusion of]{.mark} these
two master narratives into the cultural idea of the American
Republic]{.underline}. [Even in its most eugenic, rationalist, and
clinical manifestation the driving force of the American mind has always
had about it the animating spirit of [missionary
consciousness]{.mark}]{.underline}, the epistemological activism of a
moral crusade and the tangible smell of imperial rapture. Unlike other
societies where understanding technology is a learned method,
**[American culture is a technology]{.underline}**. From the war
technology research of MIT, the pioneering developments in genetic
biology at Harvard University, the information technology of Stanford
University to the leading-edge neuro-science of UCLA, American
technological reason has always operated in active alliance with
covenant theology. Certainly not in the simplistic, reductive sense of
reason as passively subordinated to proselytizing religious sects, but
definitely in the more invidious sense: namely that the overall
historical project of the official American knowledge enterprise has
deeply aligned itself as the level of value-preference and
epistemological direction with the moral ends of covenant theology \--
the creation in \"this good land\" of a form of thought which in its
brilliantly vivisectionist-logic will universalize the American future.
Consequently, regarding Harvard\'s Puritan origins: are we presented
here with a simple case of intellectual coincidence \-- the migration of
two great master discourses, one religious, the other secular, wherein
Harvard University itself is simply symptomatic of the greater passage
of American society from its faith-based origins to its scientifically
envisioned future? In this case, the story of Harvard University would
be a representative case of the comforting discourse underlying
America\'s received (official) culture, namely that what we have here is
a fateful contestation over the space of four centuries between two
warring discourses \-- religion and science \-- with the technological
primacy of the scientific imagination gradually eclipsing the Puritan
foundations. This is a truly comforting discourse because it would
confirm the essentially binary character of American thought \-- reason
versus passion; nature versus culture; science versus religion;
individuality versus collectivism \-- which has always structured
progressive (liberal) political thought in America, sustaining it in the
present in the midst of the current resurgence of the religious right.
But what if we were to consider another possibility? Could the Puritan
origins of Harvard possibly be a story of the injection into the
bloodstream of American thought, politics and culture of a new
metaphysical virus: the folding together of faith and reason into the
governing framework of American consciousness? In this case, if there
can be such a peaceable shift from the founding Puritan spirit to the
contemporary secular spirit of Harvard, could it be because there is no
essential difference between the founding spirit of Puritanism and
scientific knowledge, only a subtle shift of discourse as Puritanism
ceases to wear its crusading (religious) spirit and takes up the
garments of reason \-- nominally secular, rational and (eventually)
liberal, but in essence the epistemological spearhead of the civil
religion that is America? In the genealogy of Harvard University are we
really present at the birth of the discourse of technology as religion,
replacing the original religious origins of American consciousness with
pluralistic, rational, but competitive and always epistemologically
redemptive knowledge? Again, this is not an argument for a narrow
understanding of religion and technology, but something more
constitutive. Namely, that what happened at the moment of Harvard
University\'s Puritan origins was a dramatic rip in the space-time
fabric of American culture, instantly linking the redemptive language of
the covenant theology with a (rationalist) epistemology of discovery,
invention, dissecting research logic. Understood in quantum terms as a
warp-hole in the space-time fabric, the cultural importance of Harvard
University was that it was the specific historical site where the past
of religious enthusiasm and the future of epistemological discovery
somehow fused on the common ground of (technological) knowledge as a key
aspect of the civil religion of America. Here, the strictly Puritan
religious creed could gradually disappear in the 18th century because an
arc of intellectual electricity had already passed between the religious
eschatology of the Puritan founders and intellectual Puritanism as a
distinctive form of American thought. What might be described as the
original Puritan habit of mind \-- disciplined, vivisectionist, morally
righteous, convinced of its redemptive singularity \-- migrated easily
and without a murmur of discontent into the ruling self-consciousness of
American technological knowledge. [Consequently, **the project of
[technological reason]{.mark}**, of which the scientific imagination is
its leading epistemological spearhead \-- [could be viewed as]{.mark}
the leading contemporary [expression of religious
enthusiasm]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Conversionary, probing,]{.mark}
proselytizing, tautological in its founding assumptions]{.underline}**,
[powered by its moral self-confidence and linked to human]{.underline}
(scientific) redemption in the name of technological freedom, Harvard
University\'s lasting cultural importance is as the first historical
singularity \-- the original tear in the space-time fabric where
(Puritan) ontology migrates into (technological) epistemology. Here, the
twisted strands of faith and intelligence \-- covenant theology and the
rights of reason \-- first took root in American soil, and while they
would never be fated to find common ground in the surface clashes of
Church and State, their common eschatological aspirations for the
founding of the New Republic in a hostile world would definitely have
common purchase in their strange alliance as twin vectors \-- one a
faith-based electorate, the other reason-driven science \-- in [the
American imperial project. In American culture, god comes to wear the
mask of reason, just as much as the spirit of religious enthusiasm is
projected globally by a discourse of ([technological]{.mark})
[knowledge]{.mark} which [is]{.mark} the **[culturally genetic]{.mark}
expression [of the American war spirit]{.mark}**. **The Double Helix as
American Identity** Understood as a quantum culture, **American
[identity thrives on instant, total changes of
state]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Technologically, the intense digital
euphoria of the late \'90s was instantly replaced post- 9/11 by the hard
politics of the \"War on Terrorism.\" In finance capital, the
speculative bubble of the new economy was washed away by an American
political economy which went to ground in earthly energy resources, with
oil commodities leading the way. In politics, just as the economic
conservatism of the Bush administration replaced Clintonian social
liberalism, so too the contemporary wave of evangelical Republicanism
will undoubtedly be succeeded by a moderate Democratic regime focusing
on the valorization of social capital and solutions for the approaching
crisis of over-indebtedness. In space exploration, the Columbia Shuttle
can explode across the empty skies of Texas while the Hubble Telescope
can fade away with the passage of time, but still the International
Space Station approaches its moment of architectural realization and
plans are well underway for manned missions to planet Mars. In music,
Seattle-based grunge, itself the death-note of \'80s psychedelia, can be
blasted away by the street rap of hip-hop with its seductive combination
of fourth-world inner city violence and a first-world gated community
iPod audience. In architecture, the tragic days of 9/11 with its
spectacular glimpses of suddenly vulnerable New York skyscrapers quietly
gives way to the fluid, configurative, free-floating architecture of
Frank Gehry. A culture operating under the sign of the double helix,
America always oscillates between the referential extremes of
hyper-deflation and hyper-inflation \-- between the expansive world of
code and the deflationary forces of value-principle \-- in culture,
finance, architecture, art, politics, and maybe even in life itself.
This is one country that will only be all ground or all figuration, with
absolutely nothing in-between. Ironically, like the space-faring nation
that it seeks to be, America succeeds in playing the extremes of
inflation and deflation because of a stunning, but reliable,
astronomical manoeuver. Like a space ship on a voyage to deep space
which seeks out distant planets only to immediately sweep around them,
using their gravitational fields as a way of accelerating towards the
next galactic destination, the American mind uses the gravitational
forces of cultural extremes as a way of animating its collective energy.
The (stock market) excesses of the last great wave of tech euphoria
taken to its logical (virtual) extreme reverses field, with the business
world imploding into the grim scarcities of a commodity-based economy.
The real estate bubble will likely collapse in the direction of a
chronic crisis of consumer debt. Shuttle disasters inspire the
sacrificial fervor of unlimited galactic explorations. Opposition to the
moral relativism of liberal politics instantly mutates into bible belt
visions of a redemptive empire. The psychic shock of 9/11 flips within
the same week into proposals for the high-tech security apparatus of the
new biometric state. Again, all ground and all figuration with no
stabilizing mechanisms to split the difference, the American mind has
only always known the logic of the double helix as deepest identity.
Indeed, if it is possible to speak meaningfully of a social identity
like Americanness, it would inaccurate to reduce its immense diversity
to either of its extremes. America has never been exclusively
fundamentalist or relativist, rock \'n\' roll or country & western,
biblical or scientific, suburbs or trailer parks, the working culture of
bars, strip malls, and Wal-Marts or the professional culture of law
firms, ad agencies, and exclusive consumer brands. Americanness means
being always in motion, in competition, in flight, in careers \-- moving
fast from one change of state to another, perhaps caught up in traffic
jams, plane vectors, taxi runs or high-speed trains, but always making
of the speed of a single life a brilliant metaphor for the velocity of
the entire culture. [[Americanness means]{.mark} actually making a
double helix of your personality, ambitions, career, identity,
relationships \-- **[always being prepared to flip to the other side in
the game of life]{.mark}**]{.underline}: rewarding those who have
succeeded in morphing the poles of American culture, whether in space,
business, entertainment, sports; bestowing fame upon those who have
failed most spectacularly; admiring those adept enough to have instantly
changed states in order to survive, perhaps to play another day. Today
instrumental activism refers to the expression of the scientific logic
of the double helix in the cultural form of American identity.

Suiciding Itself to Virtual Life It would be inaccurate to say that ours
is merely a civilization of technological hubris. Nietzsche was more
insightful. For him, we are a \"gamble,\" a \"going-across,\" a
\"glance,\" a \"gathering storm.\" Or perhaps Jean-Francois Lyotard for
whom we are an \"incommensurability,\" an impossibility that cannot be
unrealized because we are perhaps never capable of full
self-consciousness. Whatever the case, it can never, and probably will
never be said of us, that we have not worn the membrane of technology as
our deepest primal, that the horizon of technology is not the gamble
upon which we stake the meaning of life itself. While it is a matter of
strict epistemological warfare between social constructionists and
hypermoderns to make much of the cultural issues attendant upon the
meaning of the \"post\" - post-society, post-culture, post-gender - I do
not think that we have yet grasped deeply into the interstices of our
thought just how graphically, how bleakly, we truly have become a
culture of the post. I do not mean this lightly. [[When the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [used nuclear weapons]{.mark} on Japan
[it precipitated a threshold event of the greatest]{.mark} cultural
[magnitude]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[History literally
ended]{.underline}]{.mark}. [If by history we mean the traditional
cultural understanding of history as an indeterminate sense of unfolding
time, an open future never fully under human control]{.underline}, then
that sense of history decisively ended in the bio-flash of Nagasaki and
Hiroshima. And again, Lyotard was right, but perhaps not in the sense he
would wish. Post-history has been \"driftworks,\" an indeterminate and
increasingly violent series of technological experiments on the horizon
of existence itself: the acceleration of space under the sign of digital
culture until [[space itself has been reduced to a \"specious
present,\"]{.mark} and the social engineering of time into a
micro-managed prism of empty granularities]{.underline}. Is it possible,
just possible, that [what Nietzsche described as
[ressentiment]{.mark}]{.underline}, [this furious reaction formation at
our own distorted instincts, now [makes a new appearance at an
exclusively cultural level]{.mark}]{.underline}? Is the real meaning of
post-history the cultural road stories of **[[a civilization suiciding
itself to virtual life]{.underline}]{.mark}**? [[Just as nuclear warfare
gutted history]{.mark}, so too [genetic engineering vacates the
body.]{.mark}]{.underline} Suddenly and unpredictably, a new master
discourse under the triumphant sign of biology as destiny has installed
itself as the epistemological lynchpin of a global alliance of the
so-called life sciences and the life industries. Cloaking itself in the
antiseptic, technical language of genetic engineering, hyping itself as
a \"bible of life,\" institutionalizing itself as the Human Genome
Project, here promising a future medical cornucopia of gene therapy,
there warning against the dysgenic effects of unmodified organisms,
everywhere dreaming anew of the genetic perfectibility of the human
body, the language of biology as destiny marks the appearance of what I
call \"third wave eugenics\". Having successfully immunized itself from
the overt fascism of the second-wave eugenics of National Socialism and
once having distanced itself from an open affiliation with its Darwinian
and Mendelian origins, third wave eugenics projects itself into the
future as the spearhead of the will to technology. Nihilism today speaks
the language of biology as destiny. The culture of third wave eugenics
is only awakening to its possibilities. We are, I believe, entirely
unprepared for this transformation. Culturally, it is as if we are
living through the cultural trauma of two abrupt, and ethically
unfathomable, shutdowns: the ending of a progressive sense of history
and an indeterminate sense of time with the climactic events of WWII;
and the ending of an understanding of the body as something more than
its genetic code. We are the victims of two Manhattan projects: one
resulting in the extermination of history, and the other in the
cryptography of the body. Might not cultural trauma of this
pervasiveness not also serve simultaneously as both a precondition for
the seduction of genetic determinism and an anticipatory sign of its
coming triumph? [Viewed ethically, [shouldn\'t such \'big
science\']{.mark} as the Human Genome Project not also [be considered in
the psycho-ontological language of trauma]{.mark}]{.underline}: the
[certain outcome of a world culture that once committed to the language
of technology as destiny now finds itself exhausted, fatigued, feeding
on its own referentials, while all the while warming itself in the sun
of technicity?]{.underline} Heidegger, Marx, and Nietzsche, then, as
trauma theorists diagnosing in advance the cultural preconditions
necessary for the triumph of the will to technology as well as its
nihilistic fallout. Artificial War \"I think that space, in and of
itself, is going to be very quickly recognized as a fourth dimension of

Artificial War has begun]{.underline}**. In its manifesto for the future
of cyber-war, Vision 2020, the newly created United States Space Command
theorizes a future battlefield of \"full spectrum dominance.\"

battlefield occurs in [the \"4th dimension\" of

such as the United States, third-dimensional warfare is surpassed by a
vision of future war in which \"battle managers\" are, in essence,
computerized editing systems running on automatic, absorbing fluctuating
data fields concerning attacks and responses, monitoring satellite
transmissions from 20,000 miles in deep space, sequencing missile
launches, integrating \"dominant maneuvers\" in space with \"precision
engagement\" on the ground, sea and air, providing \"full-dimensional
protection\" to \"core national assets\" and focusing logistics\" for a
virtual battlefield that stretches into an indefinite future. As
USSPACECOM theorizes: the control of the seas in defense of commercial
economic interests and the war of the western lands in defense of the
expansion of the American empire to the shores of California has now
migrated to a war for the \"control of space\" befitting a
\"space-faring nation\" like the United States, this spearhead of
technology. Consequently, a future of artificial warfare in which space
itself is weaponized. [4th Dimensional warfare is the technical language
by which the American empire now projects itself into a future of
Artificial War: a 4th Dimensional rhetoric of \"global

systems]{.underline}]{.mark}. I emphasize
**[[this]{.underline}]{.mark}** story [because it **[is revelatory of
the]{.mark} meaning of the [will to technology]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Here, technology is not only the chosen aim of technological
instrumentality (weaponizing space), but also involves technologies of
mythology (the well-rehearsed story of the unfolding American frontier
where wagon trains evolve into Predator Drones, and sea-faring navies
migrate into space-bound automated battlefield manager systems),
technologies of thinking (the fourfold \"tactics\" of space war:
dominant maneuver, precision engagement, full-dimensional protection,
focused logistics), and technologies of (aggressive) judgment
(\"multinational corporations\" are also listed in Vision 2020 as
potential \'enemies\' of USSPACECOM). More than futurist military
doctrine for the 21st century, Vision 2020 represents the essence of the
will to technology. Here, technology is both a space-faring means to the
successful prosecution of artificial warfare and its sustaining ethical
justification. The will to technology folds back on itself\--a closed
and self-validating universe of thinking, willing, judging, and
destining\--that brooks no earthly opposition because it is a will, and
nothing else. As Nietzsche reflected in advance: \"it is a will to
nothingness.\" Or, as Hannah Arendt eloquently argues in her last book,
The Life of the Mind, \"the famous power of negation inherent in the
Will and conceived as the motor of history (not only in Marx but also,
by implication, already in Hegel) is an annihilating force that could
just as well result in a process of annihilation as of Infinite
Progress.\"\[1\] Could it be that the world-historical movement captured
by the military logic of Vision 2020\-- this command vision of America
as the historical spearhead of the will to technology\-- represents that
which is probably unthinkable but consequently very plausible, a
contemporary expression of the metaphysics of \"not-being?\" If
\"permanent annihilation\" is the sustaining (military) creed of Vision
2020, then this also indicates that the world-historical movement, which
it so powerfully strategizes, is driven onwards by the seduction of
negation, another suicide note on the way to the weaponizing of space.
Consequently, if the American novelist, Don DeLillo, can write so
eloquently in his recent essay, \"In the Ruins of the Future,\" that
\'(T)echnology is our fate, our truth\" this also implies that in
linking its fate with the \"truth of technology,\" the United States,
and by implication the culture of globalization, may have, however
inadvertently, infected its deepest political logic with the will to
nihilism. In the sometimes utopian, always militaristic, language of
technological experimentalism, \"Not-being\" finally becomes a world
historical project. Those who are only passive bystanders to the
unfolding destiny of the contemporary American descendents of the
Puritan founders can only look on with amazement coupled with distress
as the \"American project\" embraces not only the weaponizing of space
but also genetic experimentation with the question of evolution itself.
While DeLillo goes on to say that (technology) \"is what we mean when we
call ourselves a superpower,\" his pragmatism sells short the point he
really wants to make: namely, that by linking its fate, its truth, with
the question of technology the United States has also enduringly
enucleated itself within the larger historical, indeed if USSPACECOM is
to be believed, post-historical, project of technology. Enucleated not
as something other than the technological destiny which is its
profession of faith, of truth, but enucleated in the more classical
sense of the term, of being somehow interior to the unfolding destiny of
the will to technology. The larger cultural consequence of this bold act
of willing remains deeply enigmatic. In this case, is the will to
technology an intensification of the pragmatic spirit upon which the
American experiment was founded? Or has the will to technology, at the
very moment of its historical self-realization, already reversed its
course, becoming its own negation: Arendt\'s prophecy of \"not-being\"
as a \"process of annihilation.\" On the ultimate resolution of this
question depends the American fate, the American truth, as the spearhead
of technology. On the public evidence, what makes the American project
truly distinct today is its enthusiastic abandonment of the pragmatic
will for the uncharted metaphysical territory of \"not-being.\" [[The
will to the conquest of empty spatialization]{.underline}]{.mark} and
the vivisectioning of the code of life itself [[has]{.mark} about it the
[**negative energy** of **suicidal nihilism**]{.mark}. Here, the
language of \"not-being\"\--the desiccating logic of what Heidegger
memorably termed, \"Nothingness nothings\" as the historical form of the
technological project of \"permanent annihilation\"]{.underline}
\--expresses itself vividly in two master commands: Space Command and
Genetic Command. The first operates in the language of weaponized
astrophysics where the curvature of space is manipulated for strategic
purposes, and the other sequences the human genetic code itself. Thus,
control of space is inextricably linked with control of time.
[[The]{.mark} dynamic [will to tech]{.mark}nology [projects
itself]{.mark} doubly [in the]{.mark} macrophysics of a [\"space-faring
nation\" and the]{.mark} microphysics of a [body-faring]{.mark} cellular
[biology]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is a collective demonstration of
hubris that Greeks in the classical age would only admire, and then
fear, for its (technical) audacity and stunning (metaphysical)
innocence. Ironically, at the very instance that USSPACECOM projects an
imperialist military future of \"full spectrum dominance,\" 9/11 occurs
and we are suddenly time-shifted into the age of viral terrorism.
[Similar to the incommensurability of technology itself where [the

Ressentiment against speed In a previous work, The Politics of Speed, I
argued that this willingness to hand over authority to a centralized
executive and reject democratic consultation is not due to the technical
challenge of speed (any more than the panic over the MV Sun Sea had
anything to do with the actual scope of immigration in Canada, the 500
Tamil refugees constituting a drop in the bucket of Canada's 250,000
annual new permanent residents), but rather its existential challenge
(Glezos, 2012: 31).11 This is to say that, **[in times of acceleration,
[people]{.mark}]{.underline}** fear democratic consultation, and
**[[crave authoritative renderings]{.underline}]{.mark}** because of the
way in which stable identities and narratives come under threat. This
reactionary mindset is rooted in a phenomenon I called "ressentiment
against speed." [[Ressentiment against speed]{.mark} is a kind of
crystallized cultural dynamic which [craves]{.mark} a [stability
and]{.mark} a [certainty]{.mark} which [the world is incapable of
providing]{.mark}]{.underline}. This disappointment becomes activated as
a drive for revenge against the world which is viewed as the source of
instability; against scapegoats who are identified with this
instability; and ultimately against ourselves, through calls for
authoritarian governance to control us. In this article, I wish to make
a more thorough study of this concept of a ressentiment against speed,
uncovering its specifically Nietzschean roots. This investigation is
important, because I think that a ressentiment against speed is, in
fact, one of the central components of Brown's Paradox. To understand
this, we must understand Nietzsche's philosophy of ressentiment in
greater detail. Ressentiment should not be confused with resentment.
Resentment, a sense of anger over pain or injury we may have suffered
(of whatever sort), is a natural response, as is the attempt to
challenge or overturn the sources of these pains or injuries.12Nietzsche
(1976) does not council a kind of ascetic rejection of judgment, simply
accepting everything as it comes---in which case, we would become, in
his words, the ass which can only bray "Yeah-yuh" (p. 424)---nor is he
arguing for a Christian "turning of the other cheek." Being angry,
resentful, unhappy, and so on are all perfectly acceptable to Nietzsche
so long as---and this is crucial---they serve as a spur to action. So
long as your resentment or anger becomes a vector for productive
intervention in the world, then they have the potential to be good or
noble. The trouble with ressentiment is that, counter to resentment, it
does not act as a spur to productive action (although it does still
frequently spur reactive behavior, a distinction I will shortly
explain). Quite the contrary, **[ressentiment is [resentment
crystallized]{.mark} and spiritualized]{.underline}**, **[[and]{.mark}
thus [focuses]{.mark} not on any particular agent or actor, but rather
simply [on the world as a whole]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Ressentiment
expresses itself as a generalized resentment against a world that
[allows]{.mark} pain and [suffering to occur]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It
frequently manifests as [a rejection]{.mark} of the world]{.underline},
[and the **[imagining]{.mark} of [a world of perfection]{.mark} in
opposition to this "imperfect" world**]{.underline}. Nietzsche (1968a)
makes clear how **[this [drive]{.mark} to [idealization]{.mark} is
[linked to]{.mark} ressentiment and the spirit of
[revenge]{.mark}]{.underline}**. "To talk about 'another' world than
this is quite pointless ... we revenge ourselves on life by means of the
phantasmagoria of 'another,' a 'better' life" (p. 49). This link between
idealization and revenge is displayed quite strongly, Nietzsche (1968b)
says, in many of the major works of metaphysics in the Western canon:
Psychology of Metaphysics---This world is apparent: consequently there
is a true world;---this world is conditional; consequently there is an
unconditioned world;---this world is full of contradiction: consequently
there is a world free of contradiction;---this world is a world of
becoming: consequently there is a world of being:---all false
conclusions ... It is suffering that inspires these conclusions:
fundamentally they are desires that such a world should exist; in the
same way, to imagine another, more valuable world is an expression of
hatred for a world that makes one suffer: the ressentiment of
metaphysicians against actuality is here creative. (pp. 310--311) "It is
suffering that inspires these conclusions" and **[ressentiment is
"expression of hatred for a world that makes one suffer."]{.underline}**
This is the danger of ressentiment and how it differs from resentment.
[[Resentment is a part of living]{.mark} in the world]{.underline} for
Nietzsche, a world which produces suffering and which therefore must be
responded to. **[[But ressentiment takes one out of the world. It
orients]{.mark} one's [actions to other worlds]{.mark}, worlds [which do
not exist]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the context of a discussion of an
accelerating world, ressentiment against speed manifests as an
existential resentment over the refusal of the world to provide one with
the stability---either in time or in space---that one craves. In
response, we construct idealized spaces and times, located either in the
nostalgia of the past, or in an eschatological future. Nietzsche
discusses idealist philosophy and religious cosmologies, but we can just
as easily see these drives expressed in political narratives of "golden
ages," "the good old days," "cities on the hill," "the end of history,"
or simply the security of "strong borders." These spaces/times become
refuges, defences, and weapons against an uncertain world of flow and
becoming. Just as to live in the world is to suffer, to live in time is
to be subject to contingency, and to live in space is to see that space
is always invaded, reshaped, and de/reterritorialized. To wish otherwise
is to close one's eyes and stop up one's ears, to refuse to intervene in
the world as it is. This is exactly what ressentiment against speed
produces. Nietzsche's (1968a) discussion of the philosopher's disdain
for the "world of becoming" shows how ressentiment is always already a
ressentiment against speed: All that philosophers have handled for
millennia has been conceptual mummies; nothing actual has escaped from
their hands alive. They kill, they stuff, when they worship, these
conceptual idolaters---they become a mortal danger to everything when
they worship. Death, change, age, as well as procreation and growth, are
for them objections---refutations even. What is, does not become; what
becomes, is not. (p. 45) This quote brings out another important element
of Nietzsche's thinking. Looking at Nietzsche's critique of idealism, we
might begin to take him for a kind of vulgar realist, criticizing
flights of philosophical fancy. This is to misunderstand the complexity
of Nietzsche's conception of the world of becoming. Nietzsche never
takes what the "world" is for granted and, with his focus on creativity,
even were "one" to know what the "world" is, the world---and
"one"---would almost certainly change immediately. But that is exactly
the point. Nietzsche affirms that the world is a world of change, of
becoming, of uncertainty, of contingency (and therefore necessarily of
suffering and disappointment). This is the world that we live in, and
the world in which we must act. Ressentiment and political action This
is the greatest danger of ressentiment from a Nietzschean perspective.
[Unlike that active power which a sense of resentment can potentially
inculcate, **[ressentiment functions as a reactive
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Deleuze (2002), in his analysis of
Nietzsche, develops an important insight when he says that reactive
powers are those which "decompose, they separate active force from what
it can do; they take away a part or almost all of its power" (p. 57). By
orienting us toward idealized spaces/times, and rejecting intervention
in "this world," ressentiment thus separates us from our power, from
what we can do. This is the crucial point which brings us back to
Brown's Paradox, with its description of a state of affairs where we
seem to have so much power at our fingertips, and yet seem able to do so
little with it. Note the fact that ressentiment separating us from what
we can do does not mean that we stop doing things. Indeed, quite the
opposite. [When under the sway of ressentiment we are just as prone to
take action in the world]{.underline}. [This is because in ressentiment
we have judged the world and found it wanting. We find this world of
becoming and speed to be a world of evil and suffering]{.underline}.
**[This is why ressentiment also manifests as a spirit of
revenge]{.underline}**. [[We feel that the world has punished us and we
wish to punish it back]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and [this]{.mark}
frequently [means seeking to punish those]{.mark} who are [viewed as
agents]{.mark} or avatars [of]{.mark} that [evil]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Once again, this is different than the active behavior that might be
undertaken in response to resentment. There the idea is to stop those
who injure us, or overcome those things or people who block our way. It
is never just the reactive desire for revenge, but always the active
desire to achieve some goal, to further our plans, to assert our values.
The reactive movement of ressentiment manifests as revenge. It is thus
premised upon a moral judgment, and is itself a moralizing move (i.e.
one acts primarily to punish an evil rather than achieve an end).
Indeed, it is this ability to moralize suffering, to assign blame that
is so useful to the agent of ressentiment. Nietzsche (1997) explains the
difference between resentment and ressentiment quite well in the passage
below: In my judgement, we find here the actual physiological causation
of ressentiment, revenge and their ilk, in a yearning, then, to
anaesthetize pain through emotion:---people generally look for the same
thing, wrongly in my view, in the defensive return of a blow, a purely
protective reaction, a "reflex movement" in the case of any sudden
injury or peril, such as that performed even by a headless frog to ward
off corrosive acid. But the difference is fundamental: in the one case
the attempt is made to prevent harm being done, in the other case, the
attempt is made to anaethetize a tormenting, secret pain that is
becoming unbearable with a more violent emotion of any sort, and at
least rid the consciousness of it for a moment---for this, one needs an
emotion, the wildest possible emotion and, in order to arouse it, the
first available pretext. "Someone or other must be to blame that I feel
ill." (p. 93) This desire to seek out somebody to blame is the pattern
we see time and again in the reactionary politics of ressentiment. It is
what we saw above in the case of the MV Sun Sea, and in other
anti-immigration movements like it: the attempt to identify and blame
particular actors as representative of what are broader movements and
social forces, to take the individual migrant as a synecdoche of global
acceleration as a whole. To return to Wendy Brown's (2001) analysis: If,
as Nietzsche recognized, impotent rage inevitably yields a moralizing
(re)action, how might we succeed in rereading contemporary political
life through this recognition? Might it help us understand, for example,
the contemporary tendency to personify oppression in the figure of
individuals and to reify it in particular acts and utterances, the
tendency to render individuals and acts intensely culpable---indeed
prosecutable---for history and for social relations? (pp. 21--22) And
what is more, we tend to personify that oppression in the weakest, most
vulnerable constituencies, themselves caught up in the same history and
social relations as their attackers. This is because, having separated
active force from what it can do, the politics of ressentiment naturally
takes as its enemies those who are weakest, those who are most easily
targeted and punished. In relation to these nationalist and xenophobic
movements, it is instructive that, for Nietzsche (1997), one of the most
important contemporaneous examples of the politics of ressentiment was
the anti-Semite (p. 48). But [t]{.underline}hese moralizing expressions
of revenge and punishment, and the feeling of power which comes along
with them, does not actually lead to the empowerment of the bearer of
ressentiment. This is because the standards that it sets can never be
achieved. A mindset overcome by ressentiment says that only a world free
of suffering, of uncertainty, of insecurity, is of any value. One does
not want less pain, but no pain. Not less insecurity, but no insecurity.
Thus, no matter what is done, it will always fall short of this
goalpost. Actual positive change which might improve their lot, or
increase their power, is eschewed because it will never provide them
with ideal world they crave. **[Better to engage in [moralizing
punishment]{.mark} which does nothing to solve their
pain]{.underline}**, **[but]{.underline}**, as Nietzsche says, **[hem
somewhat, [gives]{.mark} them [a feeling of]{.mark} moral
[superiority]{.mark} which will keep them going, at least for a while
longer]{.underline}**.13 What is more, **[this
[craving]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[for]{.mark} certainty, for
[stability]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}]{.underline}** most importantly, for
**[[moral
superiority]{.underline}]{.mark}**---**[[makes]{.underline}]{.mark}**
these **[[sufferers]{.mark} of ressentiment [easy prey for those who
wish to exploit them]{.mark} and gain their support]{.underline}**.
Nietzsche discussed this in terms of "the Priests," but in our days, in
democratic countries (and not just democratic countries), it is more
useful to speak of the politician of ressentiment, the politician who
does not just respond to the anxiety and fear of \[their\] public, but
actively cultivates it. As Nietzsche (1997) describes it, He brings
ointments and balms with him, of course; but first he has to wound so
that he can be the doctor' and whilst he soothes the pain caused by the
wound, he poisons the wound at the same time---for that is what he is
best trained to do, this magician and tamer of beasts of prey, whose
mere presence necessarily makes everything healthy, sick, and everything
sick, tame. (p. 93) The politician of ressentiment provides ever more
targets and scapegoats for moralizing punishment, knowing that it will
never actually solve the problems of his or her constituency (my god, if
it did, what then?). Indeed, it is not at all coincidental that
reactionary politicians of ressentiment frequently institute neoliberal
policies, making the conditions of insecurity and acceleration which
give rise to the ressentiment against speed even more prevalent. The
politician of ressentiment relies on, and exploits, his or her
constituency's craving for certainty and stability, by presenting
himself or herself as the potential source of the authority that will
usher in this other world. The politicians of ressentiment present
themselves to their constituency as "their support, defence, prop,
compulsion, disciplinarian, tyrant, God" (Nietzsche, 1997: 92). People
feel themselves incapable of bringing into being the world of security
they desire, and therefore become willing to submit to anyone who claims
that ability. How else to explain The Globe and Mail endorsement which
simultaneously decries the "antidemocratic" behavior of the Conservative
party, while craving the "discipline, leadership and bullheadedness"
that they bring to government? In this regard, we see the final stage of
ressentiment, and the final ascendancy of "The Priests," of the
politician of ressentiment: "I suffer: someone or other must be
guilty"---and every sick sheep thinks the same. But his shepherd the
ascetic priest, says to him, "Quite right, my sheep! Somebody must be to
blame: but you yourself are this somebody, you yourself alone are to
blame for it, you yourself alone are to blame for yourself." (Nietzsche,
1997: 94) When we authorize increasingly centralized and authoritarian
governments, when we do not jealously guard our civil liberties and
democratic rights, what are we saying, other than that we accept that we
are the problem with politics, that we ourselves are to blame? Give us,
then, a "leader" who will provide us with the security we crave.14 Once
again, ressentiment as that which separates an active force from what it
can do, as that which separates people and communities from their power.
And this is the irony of the ressentiment against speed. As people feel
impotent in the face of acceleration, they become more willing to give
up what power they do have to increasingly authoritarian structures or,
when they do express their power, do so by attacking the weakest
elements of the systems they oppose, usually in ways which actually
shore up the systems they are supposed to be opposing.15 Living with/in
Brown's Paradox The result of this analysis is that both attempts to
"solve" Brown's Paradox prove unsatisfying. The neoliberal approach of
embracing the uncertainty and instability of this accelerating world as
progress requires us to ignore the violence and exploitation which goes
along with it, and pretend that this "progress" is evenly distributed.
Furthermore, it dismisses the very real desires for stability and
security in our lives---and livelihoods---as somehow quaint, or even
childish. We see how the frequent neoliberal complaint that "government
cannot provide for everything" borrows the tropes of parenting, making
the dissatisfied citizen into nothing more than a peevish toddler,
rather than a stakeholder in a social contract with a legitimate
grievance. Any response to Brown's Paradox will require that we
acknowledge the very real inequality and violence that are currently
part of our accelerating world, and the impotence that most people feel
in the face of it. It must also, therefore, have some sort of program
for empowering people, for challenging these inequalities and violences,
for providing people with genuine opportunities, rather than the
neoliberal offer of "owning" one's own subjugation. As Chantal Mouffe
(2005) puts it in her attempt to understand a different, though related,
paradox "One of the crucial stakes for left democratic politics is to
begin providing an alternative to neo-liberalism. It is the current
unchallenged hegemony of the neo-liberal discourse which explains why
the left is without any credible project" (pp. 118--119). The fact that
this is still the state of affairs even after the global meltdown of the
neoliberal order in 2008 speaks to the urgency of this project, and the
power of the neoliberal narrative. Genuine efforts must be made both to
constrain the violent flows of global capital, and to insulate
individuals and communities from these flows, efforts which must be
pursued at the local, state, and global levels. One trajectory of future
research on the question of speed therefore must be to look at effective
policy responses to the exploitation of global acceleration. And yet, at
the same time as we try to empower people, we must be sure that our
desire for stability and security, our desire to oppose the uncertainty
of an accelerating world, does not manifest itself as a ressentiment
against speed. Some measure of uncertainty and instability in the world
is ineradicable. This is true for both historico-empirical reasons (we
are undergoing a period of social acceleration, and we are unlikely to
uninvent the wheel of technological speed any time soon) but also for
essentially ontological reasons. As discussed above, [**[we must
recognize that we live in a world of becoming]{.mark}**, and that
[this]{.mark} necessarily [introduces]{.mark} a note of **[flux,
uncertainty, and acceleration]{.mark} into our lives**]{.underline}. Our
teleological projections will always be disturbed by irruptions of
radical futurity, and the borders we try to police will always be
criss-crossed by deterritorialized lines of flight. What is more,
**[[these contingencies]{.mark} are not necessarily bad
things]{.underline}**. First, **[they [open us up to]{.mark} new
experiences, new possibilities, [new worlds]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Brown was not lying when she said that we now live in "a global order
more saturated by human power than ever before." We must be careful how
we think about, and use that power, but we cannot just ignore it or give
it up lightly. Indeed, in terms of achieving our first goal, a
willingness to interact constructively with the powers and opportunities
our accelerating world provides us with will be crucial. Second, and
more importantly, genuinely slow worlds, worlds with firm borders and
thoroughly policed lines of time, usually require deep authoritarian
power to maintain those borders and narratives. Certainly, it is exactly
in the ressentiment of speed that the reactionary call for control is
invoked; in the attempt to extinguish the novel, the unexpected, the
different, the other. As William Connolly (2002) puts it "A slow,
homogeneous world often supports undemocratic hierarchy because it irons
out discrepancies of experience through which constituencies can become
reflective about self-serving assumptions they habitually use to
appraise themselves in relation to others" (p. 144). Our response to
Brown's Paradox must, therefore, be careful not to turn stability and
control into a fetish, but to acknowledge the intractability---and also
the benefits and pleasures---of a world of contingency, a world of
becoming, a world of acceleration. We must therefore begin to cultivate
a third way, a response which does not so much try to resolve Brown's
Paradox, as re-inflect. Such an approach would seek to embrace the power
and opportunities which an accelerating world provides, using them to
resist the exploitation and violence inherent in the contemporary world.
However, at the same time as it sought some amount of security for
individuals, it would be willing to accept that a certain amount of
contingency and instability in the world is ineradicable. It would
ensure that this desire for stability did not manifest as a reactionary
drive for the exclusion and erasure of difference, nor through a
totalitarian drive for complete mastery over contingency. It would thus
be a politics that attempted to express itself as, in Nietzsche's words,
an "active force," which is to say a force which expresses itself, which
builds a world to its specifications, but does so with an understanding,
and even affirmation, of the limitations of life in "this world." Such a
politics therefore would rigorously have to root out the sense of
ressentiment against speed, and become comfortable with living,
organizing, and taking action, in an accelerating world of becoming.
Learning to live within a paradox (without resorting to tactics of
violence or transcendence to overcome or resolve the paradox) is no easy
thing. In recent years, many thinkers have tried to develop strategies
for how to live within the confines of paradoxes which they considered
to be constitutive of political life. William Connolly (1991), for
example, repeatedly engages with the question of what he terms "the
paradox of identity," the tension between the fact that we must
simultaneously "accept the indispensability of identity and live within
the medium of identity while refusing (while struggling vigorously to
refuse) to live \[our\] own identity as intrinsic truth" (p. 46).
Chantal Mouffe (2005) struggles with what she terms "the democratic
paradox," the tension between democracy as that which expresses the will
of the people and that which protects and expresses the rights and
agencies of the individual (pp. 2--3). Although each of these paradoxes
relate to specific topics, they are fundamentally linked to the issues I
raise, insofar as all are about the tension between the human desire for
stability and certainty (stable identities, stable communities, stable
borders), and the recognition that individual flows will always disrupt
those certainties (and the further recognition that suppressing those
flows entirely would require escalating, and ultimately infinite,
violence). All are thus about the tension between being and becoming. We
can therefore look to the way these other thinkers seek to deal with
paradox. In both cases, these two thinkers advocate the importance of
recognizing the ineradicability of paradox. Mouffe (2005) says that "it
is vital for a pluralist democratic politics to expose and acknowledge
paradoxes" (p. 16), and Connolly (1991) argues that we must learn to
think "within the code of paradox" (p. 60). Note that this recognition
of paradox, this attempt to live within paradox, does not involve a
complete letting go or rejection of our desires of stability. To do so
would be to succumb to the temptation to will away the paradox (as in
the neoliberal approach). Connolly recognizes the inescapable dimension
of identity, Mouffe accepts (and lauds) the importance of a sense of
community, and I understand the importance of some sense of stability to
the lives of individuals and communities. However, living within the
paradox also means acknowledging that these certainties will always be
marked by an inescapable de gree of contingency. [This does not mean
letting go of our desire for stability, but it does mean loosening our
attachment to it, recognizing the necessity (and indeed desirability) of
some amount of difference, individuality, and flux in the world. This
[loosening]{.mark} of [attachment]{.mark} is not easy, and **[cannot
simply be the result of policy]{.mark} prescription.**]{.underline} [[It
will]{.mark} also [mean]{.mark} challenging dominant narratives of
identity, and **[working on]{.mark} the [affective sensibilities]{.mark}
of individuals and communities [to make them]{.mark} more [capable of
coping with]{.mark} a certain amount of [uncertainty]{.mark} and
instability in the world**.]{.underline} A second trajectory of future
research on speed will therefore have to focus on how to draw on
narrative and affective resources to inculcate a sense of comfort with
uncertainty, and fight against the pull of ressentiment.16 In an ideal
world, this project of loosening people's attachments to stability would
begin to integrate with the project of making them less subject to the
violence of global acceleration, creating a self-reinforcing cycle.17 As
people become more secure, they become less subject to
ressentiment-laden tendencies. At the same time, **[[as they affectively
fight off the ressentiment-driven desire for stability, they]{.mark}
potentially [become more willing to engage in active political tactics
which might actually provide for greater security]{.mark}]{.underline}**
and stability. [[Lessened ressentiment against speed might provide the
conditions of possibility for **greater solidarity** and alliance
**building across borders and differences**]{.mark}, a greater
[willingness to **take advantage of some of the powers which global
acceleration provides**]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[Here [we]{.mark} might
[look to]{.mark} increasing examples of [global solidarity
networks]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Castells, 2012; Glezos, 2012: ch. 5)
**[[and]{.mark} to [transnational labor activism]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Stillerman, 2003). Let us be clear; [this possibility of a feedback
loop associated with living within paradox should not be taken as a
resolution of that paradox]{.underline}. We must remember that this
paradox is fundamentally irresolvable, and thus that it will be the
source of an ongoing political struggle over crucial questions ("How
much stability is enough?"; "How much velocity is desirable?"). This
struggle will always run the risk of falling into either ressentiment
against speed or indifference to the pain that it causes. This is as it
should be. As Mouffe (2005) puts it, when it comes to paradox "\[N\]o
final resolution or equilibrium between those two conflicting logics is
ever possible, and there can be only temporary, pragmatic, unstable and
precarious negotiations of the tension between them" (p. 45). The best
that we can do is try to ensure that we live that paradox deliberately.

[[Gaming encourages such]{.mark} argument innovation not for the world
community but for the debate community, teaching [students to]{.mark}
**passionately [plead for change to an empty
room]{.mark}**]{.underline}. How can a theory understand the desire of
debaters to crack open the debate methods and introduce something
"outside" of debate as Snider points to in his most recent gaming essay?
The answer is that it can't. [Debate as a model **can only create more
debate**, and [so long as our goal]{.mark} for debate [is more
debate,]{.mark} then [we will **never emerge to challenge larger
forces** ]{.mark}**of control**]{.underline}. **[Worse than being
satisfied with shouting at walls, [approaching debate from the
perspective of games encourages a god-complex that teaches debaters that
saying something]{.mark} poignant in a debate round [translates]{.mark}
[into something larger]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}**. Christopher
Douglas, a professor of English at Furman University, explores how games
teach us to adore the replay: "This is the experience structured into
the gaming process---the multiple tries at the same space-time moment.
Like Superman after Lois Lane dies, we can in a sense turn back the
clock and replay the challenge, to a better end" (2002, p. 7). What kind
of academic activity encourages students to fantasize about making
change without considering for the slightest bit how to bring that
change about? Douglas positions this impulse alongside the Sisyphean
burden of trying to make the world into a structured, controlled,
sterile environment. Sisyphus and the reset button on a videogame
console share a common ancestor with the debate model that has thirty
debate teams advocating different policies in separate rooms at exactly
the same time. [All of these examples showcase **[humans]{.mark}
desperately [attempting to construct meaning out of a confusing
world]{.mark}**]{.underline}, where [the human will to power forces the
world to fit a structure]{.underline}. Douglas reminds us that games
help to structure an oft-confusing world, imbuing the person imagining
with god-like powers (McGuire, 1980; Nietzsche 1966): Games therefore do
not threaten film's status so much as they threaten religion, because
they perform the same existentially soothing task as religion. They
proffer a world of meaning, in which we not only have a task to perform,
but a world that is made with us in mind. And indeed, the game world is
made with us, or at least our avatar in mind. (Douglas, 2002, p. 9).
Gaming draws forth a natural impulse of humans -- to make the world in
our image. But debate and videogames contain the same fantastic lure
that encourages people to pore their energies into debate. [[**Fiat and
utopian flights of fancy** are]{.mark} both **[seductions of our will to
power]{.mark}**, encouraging us to commit to becoming better
debaters]{.underline}. This process of self-important distraction has
its model in the theories of the hyper-real posited by Jean Baudrillard.
He argues that modern economies are geared to sell humans mass produced
products, but whose advertising attempts to convince people that they
have an authentic experience with the product. Economic structures make
products that are more-than real -- hyperreal in order to sell their
products. The hyperreal creates games and fantasylands that are far
richer and pleasurable than real life. One example of the hyperreal is
Epcott center at Disneyland, which reduces foreign cultures to their
most base natures -- ensuring that everything is uniform, bland, and
suitably "ethnic." While one never need worry about eating food that is
"too strange" in the Epcott lands, other negatives emerge in the world
of the hyperreal. Humans who desire order and structure to our worlds
often come to prefer the hyperreal to the real. The hyperreal has a
world with all of the attractions of our own, but with none of the
depressing realities of our own world. The hyperreal doesn't have credit
card bills or racism. The hyperreal is filled with beautiful people (who
all want to have sex with you). The hyperreal is a hot seduction pulling
our vision and hearing away form our own lives. Describing Snider's
gaming as a dangerous distraction that pulls us away from our
communities and our lives is a bit simplistic. Rather, gaming greases
the wheels for powers of control to remain in control. Douglas
articulates some of the specific ways games solidify structures of
power. In board games or computer games, however, players actually do
start out in relative equality (although there are some chance elements
as well, depending on the game), whereas in real life, so many
characteristic of one's life are already determined before birth,
including social and economic standing, political freedom, skin color,
gender, etc. What games accomplish is the instilling of the ideology of
equality, which postulates that we are born equal and that differences
emerge later on; the primary different to be explained away in this way
is that of economic disparity, and games help explain that difference as
the result of, in America, hard work and effort vs. laziness. Thus
gaming helps inculcate the ideology that covers over the fact that, with
the exception of the information technology bubble, most of those who
are wealthy in the United States were born that way. Beyond this narrow
ideological function, the game helps create subjects that accept the
inevitability of rules as things that are given and must be "played"
within---or else there is no game. This process is not total or ever
complete, as the current gaming discourse complaining about the rules
shows; here, player critique a games rules in view of a conventionalized
notion of how "reality" works, or, less often, how a game's playability
is compromised by rules that are too "realistic (Douglas, 2002, p. 24).
[Viewing debate as a game may have **the opposite effect** that Snider
desires]{.underline}. [[Gaming teaches participants to **play by the
rules** ]{.mark}**and [even when challenging the game]{.mark}**, to do
that within the games structures]{.underline}. Debaters who are moved by
poetry are encouraged to bring that poetry back to the debate realm --
not to become poets.[^1] There are certainly debate-activists who bring
their debate skills to bear on the political community. These debaters
seamlessly slide between academic hyperbole in the First Affirmative
Constructive and talking to homeless folks at a Food Not Bombs meal. But
these folks are few and far between. Most who hear the call to
conscience turn their backs on the call and justify their (in)actions by
valorizing debate.[^2] Let me be clear that the desire of individuals to
make the world is not the enemy. It is a positive drive that encourages
debaters to fiat worlds into existence or hypothesizes that the world
would be good if George Bush were before the International Criminal
Court on charges of crimes against humanity. This drive to create a
better world is the will to power. The big question is, what we do with
that will to power? Recognizing that there are many complex problems in
the world that require smart articulate people to solve them, we can
appreciate the potential value of will to power (McGuire).
**[[In]{.mark} the [debate]{.mark} context, [will to power becomes
reified in]{.mark} a hyper-real [role-playing]{.mark}
exercise]{.underline}**. Debate can be an amazing experience where
students learn about complex ideas and then take those ideas into their
own lives and communities. Debate can be a method for learning that
people have their own voices in a world drowning with mediated/televised
slime-balls. Debate can encourage intellectual growth and cause
epiphanies. Debate encourages solidarity and teaches people to struggle
together. **[[Debate is]{.mark} primed to be [a blast furnace for the
will to power]{.mark} and take it to [the furthest level of
revolutionary potential]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The only limitation
is our own]{.underline}**. [[If we frame debate to limit the
revolutionary potential]{.mark} of the participants, then [we **do a
disservice**]{.mark} **not only to our students**, but **also to the
world.** **Nietzschean will to power is a drive for self-overcoming,
transforming fuel for personal and collective change**]{.underline}.[^3]
[**[Will to power exists in all of us as a lunging to escape our]{.mark}
current [world]{.mark}** and create another beyond the moral structure
and hierarchy of this world]{.underline}. This desire to create a better
world is admirable and is at the root of social change. My criticism of
gaming is that this energy is sublimated into a fantasy world rather
than being brought to the larger world. But perhaps there is a kind of
game that might elicit something of what I desire . . . from within
debate. The Real Game: Potlatch As pointed out in the last section, the
stakes for the game of debate are high. The method of debate contains
the possibility for revolutionary insight and revolutionary praxis. The
question is how to understand an activity without systematizing and
controlling the potential of debate. **[What [we]{.mark} really
[must]{.mark} do is [let free the will to power within
debaters]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In this sense, we can use gaming as the
topoi to launch our conversation to a debate game that might encourage
revolution. But what does will to power look like? How do we encourage
it? Lets get a feeling from George Bataille, who orients the Nietzschean
impulse of will to power alongside a quote from Nietzsche himself:
Through the shutters into my window comes an infinite wind, carrying
with it unleashed struggles, raging disasters of the ages. And don't I
too carry within me a blood rage, a blindness satisfied by the hunger to
mete out blows? How I would enjoy being a pure snarl of hatred,
demanding death: the upshot being no prettier than two dogs going at it
tooth and nail! Though I am tired and feverish . . . "Now the air all
around is alive with the heat, earth breathing a fiery breath. Now
everyone walks naked, the good and bad, side by side. And for those in
love with knowledge, it's a celebration." (The Will to Power) (4). Will
to power can be the outgrowth of debate that challenges existing
structures. Bataille and Nietzsche desire a wild emancipation from
traditional structures, far beyond conventional morality. Coupling
Nietzsche's theorizing with the practice of debate something new can
emerge, but only if we free ourselves from the shackles of conventional
debate, including gaming. How to break these chains? How do we get
beyond that which has brought us so far? To help, I want to turn to Guy
Debord and the Situationists. Guy Debord was a French revolutionary
whose political theorizing and activism culminated in the creation first
of the Letterist International and later in the establishment of the
Situationist International. The Letterists/Situationists were
revolutionary philosophers who believed that the situations of the
modern world were increasingly controlled by mediated/corporate
experience. They viewed traditional politics in all of its reformist
formats as a waste of time. Through a variety of situations (manipulated
by the situationists) it was possible to create revolutionary meaning.
They used a variety of tactics in order to elicit revolutionary change.
Some of their methods, like detournement, have become common post-modern
critical theory concepts.[^4] I focus our attention on the Situationists
because they succeeded in creating a revolution. Situationist propaganda
and theorizing were at the heart of the Parisian rebellion of May of
1968. This was the most powerful expression of malaise against the
increasingly wealthy industrial western world. The riots in Paris, which
upended cars and collectives emerged in downtown, became a model for
revolutions in the industrialized north. Debord was seen as an
intellectual architect of the uprising of students and workers.
Situationists/Letterists were increasingly capable of articulate
criticisms of the nature of the spectacle. These were often told through
journals, graffiti, and posters (Dark Star Collective, 2001; Debord,
1995; Jappe, 1992; Hussey, 2001). One of the most important Situationist
tactics was articulated in the potlatch. The potlatch was a practice
modeled on American indigenous communities of increasingly committed
giving. In the potlatch, indigenous would give everything they had to
each other, ever increasing the stakes of the gifts until the gifts were
so outlandish the offers exposed the foolish nature of ownership.
Potlatch became so important to these revolutionaries that they named
their first journal potlatch because the writings held within the
journal would hopefully be given on and on in an ever increasing spiral.
Potlatch became an extended metaphor for the Situationists/Letterists,
indicating all the possible spaces where revolution could emerge without
capitalist economies. Every non-capitalist moment eked out of the day
was articulated as a potlatch. Every relationship that emerged along
side revolutionary dialogue became a potlatch. In a recent biography of
Debord and the situationists, the author Hussey describes the Potlatch.
Potlatch . . . is the highest form of game. It is also the living moment
of poetry, a moment which breaks down or reverses conventional
chronological patterns. Most significantly, the object or gift which the
Letterist International gave functioned symbolically between the giver,
the International Letterists, and the receiver. The relationship between
the two constitutes a third term -- the gift is also a catalyst of the
future in the form of a crystallization of desire. 'Don't collect
Potlatch!' ran a line at the end of the journals second year. "Time is
working against you!" (Hussey, 2001, p. 89) For the Situationists, [the
[potlatch was **the ultimate resistance to** ]{.mark}**traditional
economies**]{.underline}. Originally a concept theorized by George
Battaille, [the potlatch was seen as a method to criticize the
acquisition/showcase methods of modern [capitalist
economies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Because **[the potlatch could never be
returned]{.underline}**, **[[it highlighted the foolishness of the
modern economy and state]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Through sacrifice and
destruction, **[the act of giving overwhelms the possible
response]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Eventually, [the social requirements of
the potlatch necessitate that every society member give away everything
they could ever have.]{.underline} Yet [we should not move too far from
the fundamental truth of [the potlatch]{.mark}: **it [is]{.mark} in fact
[a game]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indigenous nations would choose to
exchange gifts in the potlatch as a form of entertainment. But let us
not understate the importance of games. This game was made illegal
because it was so dangerous to colonial economies. The Potlatch was
recognized as threatening the burgeoning trading economy that was
central to westward expansion. The potlatch was the most dangerous idea
that indigenous nations could forward against the white/capitalist
drive.[^5] The act of giving too much was the threat. This move
disturbed the intense drive for acquisition. Why fight to trade beaver
pelt, when at the next potlatch your neighbor might give you all her
possessions? Potlatch was threatening because it made competition
meaningless. Non-competitive social structure was only one threat from
the Potlatch. Situationist biographer Jappe discovers an obscure
quotation by Debord on the Potlatch (Debord himself was remarkably
close-lipped about the meaning of Potlatch): "Debord refers explicitly
to the Indian custom of Potlatch and announces that 'the non-saleable
goods that a free bulletin such as this is able to distribute are novel
desires and problems; and only the further elaboration of these by
others can constitute the corresponding return gift'" (148). What was
exchanged in Debord's vision was not necessarily goods but rather
ideas.[^6] **[[Debate is the ultimate potlatch]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[demanding that we offer]{.mark} up [something]{.mark} inside of
ourselves [without asking for something in return]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Debate provides a few minutes carved out of lives that are otherwise
consumed by pop-up ads, or email. When I think about the moments that I
treasure in my life, few of them are moments of consumption. I don't
remember when I bought my television, but I remember with painful
longing the last bicycle ride I took with friends. Alongside the
memories of moments with friends and in nature, I treasure a collection
of moments in debate. Moments when I first learned about ideas, late
nights in the squad room, the friendships that emerged, and watching my
debaters grow and develop. The parts of the potlatch where humans draw
out moments of freedom with each other are increasingly the only thing
that keeps me interested in debate. Debord and the Situationists wanted
people to take their initial offerings of the Potlatch and move them
along into their own lives. We can do the same thing with debate. Almost
all of us have debate memories that are deeply infused with the
Potlatch-ethic. All it takes is for us to seek out and celebrate those
moments, and our community will change. But **[these [moments of time
have to be grappled away from the industrial-capitalist state with great
gusto]{.mark}. [We must]{.mark} be brave to [crack open
debate]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In our own lives, [[we should strive to
bring about]{.mark} the kinds of [realizations that **elicit
revolutionary transformation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Snider's gaming
does not bring us forward in direct revolutionary thinking. Rather, it
encourages revolutionary thought and then focuses its power into the
system of debate. The solution for Snider is not to continue looking for
a way to explain and systematize debate but, rather, to embrace the
confluence of potential meaning in debate and lunge forward. **[[Debate
should be about taking risks and creating new meaning out of our
desires]{.underline}]{.mark}**. We should never sublimate our feral
interests and instead should seek the highest level of meaning. **[[Let
us push gaming further]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Let us find games that
fulfill our revolutionary potential, take whatever moments we can for
ourselves and try to push for as much change as we possibly can. In this
case, perhaps it is not the game, but the players who have not yet made
their move.

game or two of pin the tail on Bill Gates' donkey, and, who knows, even
spin the bottle. Thinking I haven't noticed it reading over my shoulder,
my PC slinks away into the next room and suddenly starts to cough with
the rasping sound of a summer algorithmic cold. I can already hear it
whining for a Win 95 upgrade.

he'll get back to them later. With a survey for a conscience, Clinton is

field, marked the outer frontier, the irrevocable "No," that
first-generation fascism was never able to transgress. It's our turn
now. Second-generation fascism lives again in the form of the Bosnian
Serbs. What will be the response of our generation? A moral assent to
evil by tuning out Bosnia and turning off TV? Or, following Camus, an
earlier traveller on the road against fascism, might it be possible that
we'll remember his fateful words addressed to the survivors of the 20th

CLOSING DOWN THE REAL WORLD/ OPENING UP THE VIRTUAL WORLD

[[It is no coincidence that the "shipping out" of Windows 95 and the
fall of Srebrenica take place on the same weekend.]{.mark} These are
deeply entwined events. [What takes place]{.mark} in Redmond and
Srebenica **[is the final settlement of human flesh]{.mark}** in the
last days of the 20th century: **[the bitter division of the world into
virtual]{.mark} flesh [and surplus flesh]{.mark}**. [Windows]{.mark}

position of digital flesh. It [[installs the **new codes of the master

Windows 95 might be very good for file management, multi-tasking, and

#### Welcome to the age of the bored eye, the eye that's possessed with impossible dreams for a technical future and will never be satisfied -- with this, we have become images to the world around us

**Kroker 4** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct professor
of political science at the University of Victoria, "THE WILL TO
TECHNOLOGY AND THE CULTURE OF NIHILISM: HEIDEGGER, NIETZSCHE, AND MARX",
University of Toronto Press, Pages 166-168, March 2004, MG)

[[The digital age unleashes]{.mark} deeply [paradoxical
tendencies]{.mark} in the unfolding history of the image, moving
simultaneously between the violent repression of the material memory of
the photographic image and its recombinant recreation in the culture of
the digitized imaginaire]{.underline}. Out of the ashes of photography
under the sign of analogue suddenly appears the phoenix of the digitized
image-machine. A doubled story of repression and creation?

Or something else?

[If [today the image proliferates with such]{.mark} velocity and
[intensity that human flesh]{.mark} literally [struggles to become the
image of its own impossible perfection]{.mark} --witness [the
**psycho-ontology of cosmetic surgery**]{.mark} -- then this might also
mean that we are now fully possessed by the power of the image. Not
possessed by the power of the image as something somehow ulterior, and
possibly alien, to human agency, but possessed by the image as a
fulfilment of human desire, and perhaps desperation.]{.underline} In a
Copernican flip, **[we ourselves are images to the world surrounding
us]{.underline}**: designer bodies, rip-tide abs, faces as gestures,
attitudes as probes, lips like invitations, pouts like refusals, eyes
like a going under. Possessed [by the images once thought as somehow
safely alienated as representations, [we]{.mark} ourselves [have
become]{.mark} founding [referents to the simulacrum that invades
us.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[A story of body invasion? Not really. Contemporary society is no longer
the culture of the disembodied eye. Today, we play out the drama of our
private existence along and within the iris of the imagemachine that we
once dismissed as somehow external to human ambitions. Our fate, our
most singular fate, is to experience the fatal destiny of the image as
both goal and precondition of human culture]{.underline}. As goal, the
power of the image inheres in the fact that [contemporary culture is
driven forward by the will to image as its most pervasive form of
nihilism. As precondition, [we are possessed individuals because we
are]{.mark} **fully [possessed by the enigmatic dreams of impossible
images]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[That we are possessed by the power of the image with such finality has
the curious repercussion of driving the image-machine mad]{.underline}.
The matrix of image-creation as it evolves from analogue to digital and
now to the biogenetic struggles to keep pace with the capricious tastes
and fast-bored appetites of human flesh as an image-machine. [**[It is
the age of the bored eye:]{.mark}** [the eye which flits from
**situation to situation**, from **scene to scene**]{.mark}, from image
to image, from ad to ad, with a restlessness and high-pitched
consumptive appetite [that can **never really ever be fully
satisfied**]{.mark}. The bored eye is a natural nihilist[. It knows only
the pleasure of the boredom of creation as well as the boredom of
abandonment]{.mark}. [It never remains still]{.mark}. It is in perpetual
motion. It demands novelty. It loves junk images. It turns recombinant
when fed straight narratives. [It]{.mark} has ocular appetites that
[demand satisfaction]{.mark}. [But it can never be fully sated because
the bored eye is the empty eye]{.mark}. [That is]{.mark} its secret
passion, and the source of [its **endless
seduction**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The bored eye is the real power of the image. It takes full possession
of the housing of the body]{.underline}. It is the nerve centre of flesh
made image. It is the connective tissue between the planetary ocular
strategies of the image matrix and the solitude of the human body. [[The
bored eye is bored]{.mark} with its (bodily) self. That is why it is
always dissatisfied. [It needs to blast out of the solitude]{.mark} of
its birthplace in the human cranium in order to ride the electronic
currents of the global eye]{.underline}. No longer satisfied with simply
observing the power of the image, [the bored eye now demands to be the
power of the image]{.underline}. Which is why, of course, the archival
history of twentieth-century photography can now be safely interred. At
dusk, the eye of the image takes flight in the restless form of the
bored eye forever revolving and twisting and circulating in an image
matrix of which it is both the petulant consumer and unsatisfied author.

[Ironically, [the bored eye has]{.mark} itself now [become both
precondition and goal for the despotic image]{.mark}. Which is why
[images can]{.mark} now [be]{.mark} so [powerful]{.mark} precisely
[because they are caught in a **fatal miasma of powerlessness**]{.mark}
before the ocular deficit disorder of the bored eye. The despotic image
may demand attention as its precondition for existence, but [the bored
eye]{.mark} is seductive because of its [refus]{.mark}al [to provide
any]{.mark} sign of [lasting interest]{.mark}]{.underline}. A love
affair turned sour. With this predictable result -- [[the increasing
ressentiment of the digital image]{.mark}: '[Analog is having a burial
and **digital is dancing on its grave**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Blended Reality

#### [In the new real, we are running with the robots: industrial robots for seamlessly automated car manufacturing; medical robots for facilitating patient care in assisted living retirement communities; warrior robots engaged in materializing the imaginative game scenarios of cyber warfare; toy robots that promise a happy first encounter between machines and the newest generation of humans; and, most of all, invisible robots circulating in the data clouds of social media as sociobots. Perhaps more than we may suspect, ours is already a blended reality in which robots not only live among us as artificially programmed prosthetics equipped with articulated limbs and complex sensory arrays but have also begun to live within us, quietly but insistently bending the trajectory of human perception, imagination, and desire in the direction of a future life of the mind that bears unmistakable signs of a robotic imaginary.]{.underline} Consider, for example, the following stories focusing on the complex intersection between human intelligibility and robots, both invisible and visible. Neurobots While the future of human encounters with robots has often been envisioned as an ominous struggle between fragile, but immensely adaptive, humans and powerful, although less creative, mega-robots, the real-world encounter has proven to be decidedly low key, ubiquitous, and technologically subtle. Seemingly everywhere, [the digital body has been]{.underline} swiftly [delivered to its robotic future in the form of a pervasive network of invisible bots:]{.underline} [sociobots swarming social media sites creating contagious flows of viral information, influencing individual perception, imitating human behaviour; capitalist superbots in the form of high-frequency trading algorithms that powerfully shape the ebbs and flows of stock transactions]{.underline}; [psy-op bots in the service of military intelligence that function to effectively influence political perception; and, of course, those other multiplicities of net bots -- spiders, crawlers, and malware -- that trawl the internet, sometimes like proletarian worker robots performing routine web indexing functions but at other times like futurist versions of the Cylons in Battlestar Galactica, quietly searching for critical weaknesses in websites, software programs, and internet infrastructure itself.]{.underline} Consequently, to [the question concerning future encounters between humans and robots, the answer is not only already well known but also pervasively experienced as the contemporary real-time environment of digital life.]{.underline} No longer content to remain at a safe, mechanical distance from their human creators, robots in the form of those lines of code that we call ["bots" have already broken down the walls of human perception, inhabiting the world of social media as their cybernetic hive, attaching themselves to the human imagination in the seductive form of hashtags and tweets, and, all the while, migrating the spearhead of robotic evolution itself from the mechanical to the neurological.]{.underline} In the usual way of things, [no one really anticipated that robots would faithfully follow the trajectory of technology itself, from high visibility to pervasive invisibility, travelling from the outside of the human body to the deepest interior of human subjectivity, quickly evolving from the mechanical to bots with very active cognition.]{.underline} When [bots]{.underline} proliferate in the digital clouds that surround us, when they actually [take up neurological residence in human perception, desire, and imagination, we can acknowledge with some confidence not only that we are already running with the robots but that something more uncanny is taking place: namely, that robots are already living among us and, most decidedly, living within us.]{.underline} The meaning of this is fully enigmatic. When robots were something that we could see -- for example, the cute Japanese robot that played soccer with an American president and concluded with a victory dance and cheer1 -- we could take the measure of the event in traditional humanist terms. But what happens when robots actually trek across the uncanny valley? We don't mean "uncanny" in the usual sense of the term, because robots physically start to become indistinguishable from humans, but in the deeper sense that bots are perhaps already an indispensable dimension of post-human subjectivity. We mean it literally. For example, it is reported that 30 percent of all Twitter content is non-human (bots and algorithms): bots replying to articles, bots masquerading as friends in order to redirect traffic, bots for spying, for trading, for porn: spambots, bimbots, sociobots. As one media report2 notes, sociobots are amazingly adaptive "automated charlatans" programmed to tweet and retweet, supported by vast databases all the better to fool their human interlocutors, "fake sleep cycles" to better imitate the slow rhythms of natural life, and replete with "quirks, life histories and the gift of gab." Their presence is felt everywhere: advertising on social media, swaying elections, trading stocks, phishing, sparking scandals, rumours, suspicions, and anxiety.3 The report goes on to note that half of net traffic is non-human and that, in "two years, about 10 percent of the activity occurring on social online networks will be masquerading bots."4 In that case, [we are already deep into the strange times of a fully blended reality of humans and non-humans with the urgent question remaining, Have we become our own uncanny valley?]{.underline} More than the sheer quantity of sociobots invading every dimension of digital life, what is significant about this report is something left undisclosed: that [bots are integral to the question of social identity]{.underline}. [We don't simply mean "integral" in the sense of leveraging perceptions, desires, and imagination to move in certain directions but "integral" in the fuller sense of the term -- that, perhaps, we have already succeeded in moving beyond the point of real-time familiarity with the presence of bots to actually being part human/part bot. In this case, what may be truly uncanny is our own online subjectivity, occupying as it does an entirely unstable boundary between lines of code and lines of skin.]{.underline} [When bots come inside us, pacing our existence with their artificial "sleep-wake cycles," mirroring our moods with "persona management software," and creating networks of their own consisting of "friends and like-minded followers," we can recognize that we have become the first and best of all the post-human subjects, breathing in lines of code as the real source of digital energy that allows us finally to come alive as the flesh and blood of sociobots.]{.underline} More than half a century ago, the American psychologist B.F. Skinner correctly (and in fact enthusiastically) endorsed a future society based on a relatively primitive theory of "radical behaviourism."5 Setting aside enduring questions concerning the origin and meaning of introspection and unconscious desires, Skinner suggested an alternative form of human subjectivity constructed on the strictly behavioural foundations of "operant conditioning."6 For Skinner, what matters is the quantified self: the observable self that acts in and upon the world on the entirely predictable basis of social reinforcements -- some negative (punishment), others positive (rewards), with yet still others more neutral in their role as reinforcements. Reducing the diverse spectrum of individual human experience -- lingering desires, upstart passions of the heart, long-buried psychological repressions, mixed motives -- to the observable behaviour of a subject that is postulated as acting on the basis of a social protocol of rewards and punishments (avoiding that which hurts, privileging that which rewards), Skinner's vision held that what was true in the laboratory with respect to the behaviour of rats and pigeons was equally true of social behaviour in general. In other words, human behaviour could actually be modified by the application of the soft power of a token economy, providing actual, and sometimes symbolic, rewards as an inducement for certain privileged forms of social behaviour, while gradually extinguishing undesirable behaviour by the hard power of pain and punishment. Stated in its essential elements, Skinner's vision of social behaviour -- "operant conditioning" -- provided a way of transcending millennia of concern with that strange and definitely precarious mixture of animality, intellectuality, and emotion that is the nature of being human in favour of an ecstatic theory of remaking humans by the organized application of a radically new technology of human subjectivity -- radical behaviourism. In this perhaps pragmatic and certainly deeply visionary theory of the human condition, there was always a twofold ontological assumption: first, that persistent concerns with supposed epiphenomena such as psychic blockages, unknown motives, and interior sensibility could, and should be, dismissed in favour of a technological vision of subjectivity open to its surrounding environment, deeply influenced by its actions, and responding accordingly; and second, that the "self" of radical behaviourism could be socially modified, indeed socially engineered, by the methodical application of the principles of operant conditioning. Curiously, while at the intellectual level, the technological utopia that Skinner envisioned in his books Walden Two7 and Beyond Freedom and Dignity8 was surpassed by theoretical debate about the rise and decline of all the referentials of truth, power, and sexuality, Skinner's prophetic vision of a social self capable of being modified by the soft power of social reinforcements -- particularly the "token economy" of radical behaviourism -- has finally found its key public expression in the once and future society of [sociobots. Not simply a new technology of communication perfectly fit for the age of social media, sociobots are, in their essence, something very different, namely a technology for modifying human subjectivity that is simultaneously political and neurological: political because sociobots embody how the ideology of operant conditioning is inserted into the deepest recesses of the data mind -- the externalized, circulating consciousness characteristic of the quantified self of social media; neurological because sociobots are the primary cybernetic agents of "cognitive hacking," that complex process whereby the key driver of the newly emergent attention economy -- perceptual attention -- is encouraged to turn in certain directions, sometimes by positive reinforcers operating in the language of seduction and at other times by negative reinforcers functioning in terms of fear and anxiety.]{.underline} [When swarms of sociobots attach themselves to the data mind -- flirting, chatting, spying, tracking -- we can clearly recognize that we are already living in a society of soft power and modulated violence.]{.underline} Indeed, one of B.F. Skinner's most celebrated instruments for testdriving the theory of operant conditioning was the "Skinner Box,"9 a closed, programmable environment whereby test subjects -- including laboratory rats and pigeons -- could be probed, reinforced, and, if necessary, punished as a way of calibrating, and thus engineering, the protocols of effective social modification. Now, just because Skinner's theory of operant conditioning -- with its stripped-down assessment of human behaviour, its studious attention to the best practices of a token economy, and its transcendent vision of behavioural modification guided by experts -- was seemingly displaced by theoretical attention to the death of the subject, from poststructuralism and postmodernism to post-humanism, and most recently by new materialist theories focused on the complexity of objects as life forms, does not necessarily mean that operant conditioning, with its profoundly eschatological vision of behavioural modification, was lost to the world of emergent technologies. In one of those superb ironies of cultural reflection, the Skinner Box could be quickly left behind as so much detritus on the way to post-human culture precisely because the theory of operant conditioning was always waiting patiently and persistently for its technological realization by a creative form of new media -- in fact, social media -- that could instantly and decisively translate the anticipatory vision of soft power, token economy, and reinforcement theory that was the Skinner Box into the generalized network of sociobots within which we find ourselves enmeshed today. In this case, when sociobots take active possession of social media, when complex patterns of human neurology expressed by the ablated consciousness of the data mind are gradually shaped, indeed modified, in their observable outcomes by bots that chat, make suggestions, anticipate connections, manifest seemingly total recall, and facilitate the attainment of desirable goals (better health, greater intelligence, early warnings), then, at that point, the Skinner Box is no longer an object outside ourselves but something else entirely -- a technology of programmable subjectivity rendered part flesh/part data. [Today, it is not so much that we are mingling with physical robots in ways anticipated by cinematic and science fiction visions of the technological future, but that clear, discernible borders have been eliminated between immaterial (social) robots and ourselves, so that it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a friend or a commentator on social media is human or the sensitively attuned response of an artificial life form -- a sociobot -- who can know us so intimately because, in daring to become fully digital -- being social media -- we may have inadvertently entered in the long-anticipated world of]{.underline} B.F. Skinner [redux]{.underline}. [Replete with swarms of bots -- sociobots, neurobots, spybots, junkbots, hackerbots -- the ablated Skinner Box that is the universe of contemporary social media has this common feature: expert systems in the form of artificial life forms function ceaselessly to modify, cajole, influence, and channel the privileged psychic targets of human perception and social attention in the token economy of network culture, with its powerful technologies of soft facilitation and its equally harsh technologies of command, including surveillance and tracking. Happily taking up neurological residence in the data mind, armies of neurobots, sometimes acting at the behest of corporate capitalism or perhaps under governmental supervision, are, in effect, the way in which power speaks today -- otherwise invisible databases that seduce, inform, link, and recall as leading spearheads of evocative communication between robots and humans. With the sheer invisibility of sociobots, the fact that the first, fateful encounter between robots and ourselves occurs in the innocuous, immaterial form of lines of code may intimate the elimination of the pervasive anxiety surrounding the "uncanny valley" -- that psychic moment identified by robotics engineers when robots are effectively indistinguishable from human presences.]{.underline} In this case, the uncanny valley of robotics engineering lore may well constitute an ancient, psychological reinforcer supporting the pattern maintenance of established boundary lines long viewed as necessary to the self-preservation of the human species. [While lines of code never rise to the psychological prominence of increasingly human-like mechanical robots, they do enjoy an important technological attribute, namely encouraging the human species, individually and collectively, to drop its traditional psychological aversion to mixing robotic and human species identity, which thus increases the vulnerability of the human species to quick insertions of the most fundamental elements of robotic consciousness such as ambient awareness, distributive consciousness, circuits of fast connectivity, and a fully externalized nervous system into the emergent infrastructure of the digital brain]{.underline}. [Definitely not openly hegemonic and certainly not operating in the language of domination, the first encounter of neurobots and humans produces individuals who actually begin to see, think, and feel like the sociobots of their wildest dreams]{.underline}

#### The resolution's will to communicate digitality as a speech act externalizes consciousness into a violent eyeballing of society

**Kroker 4** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct professor
of political science at the University of Victoria, "THE WILL TO
TECHNOLOGY AND THE CULTURE OF NIHILISM: HEIDEGGER, NIETZSCHE, AND MARX",
University of Toronto Press, Pages 80-82, March 2004, MG)

Digital Ressentiment

[This is supposedly the long-awaited '**age of communication'** and
'accelerated culture,' an era in which even the consumer appliances of
everyday life get into the **speech act**, beginning to whisper
telematic commands to one another, a time of 'smart machines' and speed
bodies and wireless minds and 'connected eyeballs' and streamed images.
It is a time in which the externalization of consciousness so necessary
to Internet consciousness -- **the will to communicate** -- has about it
such a degree of obsession and dynamic cultural foregrounding that its
very obsessiveness, its]{.underline} heightened degree of
almost-mandatory compulsiveness and open-ended futurism, opens up the
question of the 'why?' [The question of '**why digitality**?' and,
particularly, 'why in this culture?' cannot be answered satisfactorily
within the ruling axiomatic. It is in the nature of a governing
axiomatic to guard itself, stolidly and well, against the undermining of
its logic by providing in advance an array of digitally satisfying
responses to the question of the why]{.underline}. A blindingly
brilliant digital future opens to the initiated. But for those
recalcitrant minds who thought-drift back to the foundational query of
'why digitality?' and 'why now?' it might be to the preparatory thought
of a desert hermit that one would turn for an undermining reflection. In
Thus Spake Zarathustra, Nietzsche said that [the ultimate frustration of
the dynamic will is that 'it cannot turn time backwards,' that the will
to will is ultimately frustrated by the passing of 'time's it
was.]{.underline}' As digital reality, this successor to the exiting of
the Christian God, projects itself forward in the accelerated language
of light-time and light-space, as [the will to universal space defeats,
indeed humiliates, the reality of particular time, might there not also
be heard in the command language of digital futurism a perceptible hint
of ressentiment? Could it be that digital futurism for all of its
technological wonderment, for all of its bountiful expression of the
will to communicate, has about it the familiar scent of revenge-taking?
In an ironic turn in the logic of eternal recurrence, isn't the present
era somehow similar to other periods of technical enlightenment in which
the dull implacability of 'time's it was' is supposedly vanquished by
the will to time-binding light-space? A culture of digital
ressentiment.]{.underline}

[But, of course, in the culture of advanced technicity, at that precise
historical juncture wherein software codes combine with genetic
engineering and molecular biology to produce giddy visions of bio-chips
recombinant, we have supposedly abandoned the sacrificial language of
revenge-taking. Ours is a culture ruled by the illusion that we have
finally resolved the **irreconcilabilities of time and
space**]{.underline} that drove Nietzsche to the desert spaces of his
mind. [But, what if we haven't?]{.underline} What if the exuberant
rhetoric of digital futurism can't hold? What if the speed culture of
streamed visions and flash noise can be so dynamic precisely because its
existence is predicated on a repressed amnesia of a more fundamental
paradox in the human condition? And what if in a not untypical response
to amnesic repression, the culture of digital reality is a global
repetition of patterns of individual psychopathology? In this case, [the
drive to the light-time and light-space of digitality would also be in
the way of revenge-taking, a **violent experiment conducted on a
planetary scale** to finally respond to Nietzsche's insight that the
last frustration of the will to will is its inability to turn back the
stone of 'time's it was]{.underline}.' Isn't this exactly what Heidegger
meant by a culture of 'profound boredom' [-- a split culture where the
passing of time is repressed in favour of the will to (spatial)
nothingness?]{.underline}

[Today, the will to power speaks in the language of the digital nerve.
An expression of (techno) life itself, the digital nerve is a violent
forcefield, pulsating with energy, netting with a **utopian will to
connectivity**, vibrant with auto-emotion, and glowing wireless with
streamed data]{.underline}. Disconnected from the ancient gods that
inspired the will to (sacrificial) power of antiquity and abandoning
open loyalty to Christian theodicy[, the digital nerve is that point
where the will folds back upon itself, becoming in the form of the will
to will its own grounds of justification and ultimate goal. A will-less
will, the digital nerve oper- ates in the form of the mirror of
virtuality]{.underline}. Here, the fatal tensions of human flesh in the
world, the immediate irreconcilabilities of time and space, are
transcended in favour of a digital logic that mediates the after-images
of light-space and light-time. What the French philosopher Teilhard de
Chardin once described in religious terms as t[he electronic 'noosphere'
has now been realized in the relentless pragmatic, soft engineering
language of the electric eyeball. It is as if life itself has
disappeared into the optical nerve of the digital eye, and a pure
circulation of optically refracted digital data has substituted itself
for the polar tensions of human flesh on its way to a meeting with
'time's it was' and human space as somehow integral to questions of
memory and social vision]{.underline}. When the digital eye is ripped
from the dark cavity of the skull, when the optical nerve is
externalized in the transcendent form of streamed data flesh, then the
only sound to be heard may be the discordant playing of a piano keyboard
in an empty room. And why? Because the abiding language of myth will not
be denied. [The more extreme the externalization of consciousness in the
form of digital media, the more **violent the 'eyeballing' of society**
in streamed data culture, the more confident the technical harvesting of
the human remainder, the more perceptible the keening sound of something
future-lost in a spatially over-determined digital nerve]{.underline}.
Just when we thought we had finally overcome Nietzsche, we merge with
the digital nerve only to find the retelling of a more ancient account
of technological hubris. [Nihilism haunts digitality.]{.underline}

### Emancipatory Joy Method

#### Thus, we endorse a politics of emancipatory joy -- that's the only way to end the colonization of colour

[The attempts by millions of people across the Middle East and the
Maghreb to overthrow the illegitimate authorities that suffocate their
collective dreams can be productively]{.underline}, if only ever
partially, [understood as a **collective ontopolitical desire to
experience a different way of being human together.** Not surprisingly,
this desire for existential freedom has been met with the full force of
the **international security apparatus**, namely the authorisation of a
humanitarian war---a war that kills human beings in their defence---that
is waged in Libya's skies, upon Libyan bodies, across every screen, in
all of our minds]{.underline}. I am not suggesting that this
relationship is intentional, only that [it is somewhat causal:
predictable]{.underline}, expected, almost scripted because [political
outburst perversely necessitates containment according to the fatal
logic of this apparatus.]{.underline} After all, [the flowing spectacle
of people demanding different lives was staunched]{.underline}, in the
perception of those who have experienced the Arab Spring as a media
event, [by the redirection of cameras away from the coursing streets and
towards **the irresistible carnage** accompanying the deployment of a
humanitarian intervention that functions, ever ironically, via "strike
sorties" and "humanitarian assistance movements."2 The Arab Spring
emerges, then, as a revelatory moment when the aesthetic mechanics of
contemporary global governance are revealed.]{.underline}

[Such a glimpse has been enabled by those bodies---to whom we owe not
only debt but gratitude---which are actively transforming the
possibilities of collective life by **demanding to be seen and
attempting to be heard**.3]{.underline} To begin to think with the Arab
Spring invites one to repose Jacques Ranciere's originally unrelated
question, "[what did the demonstration demonstrate,
exactly]{.underline}?" (2009, p. 34) and ask, firstly, [how did these
demonstrations demonstrate]{.underline}? From Mohamed Bouazizi's burning
flesh to the living streets of Tunis, Cairo, Manama, and Homs, millions
of people abandoned the (in)security of everyday routine and their
apolitical "private" lives to reassert "public" spaces and voice their
unquenched desire for political change. [The willingness of those who
had previously been unwilling to make their voices heard and to display
their bodies publicly through acts of opposition impregnated the
uprisings in the sense that Alexander Potts defines as the "**unfolding
of an event rather than its completion**" (2009, p. 61).]{.underline}

[This episode is not disdainful anarchy but, rather, the enabling of
possible **actualisations of previously unimaginable
potential**.]{.underline} Ranciere's work obviously allows us to
emphasize the aesthetic implications of this politics, where perception
and visuality are paramount.4 ["A community of sense]{.underline}," he
writes, "[is a certain cutting out of space and time that binds together
practices, forms of visibility, and patterns of
intelligibility]{.underline}" (2009, p. 31). Of course, the essential
outsides of such a community are the excluded margins, the realm of
invisibility upon which any 'distribution of the sensible' seems to
depend. [The Arab Spring signifies a radical attempt to repartition the
sensible so as to disrupt a community based upon terror, repression, and
exclusion]{.underline}. Ranciere would enjoy the overt democratic pleas
of the marching citizens because he theorizes an original link between
politics and democracy (2007, p. 97) based on 'dissensus.' Indeed,
politics, for Ranciere, is the rare but immanent disruption of an
existing community of sense. David Joselit explains it as [an eruption
"from outside normative distributions, launched by those who are (as of
yet) **unauthorised to speak, who have no standing or
visibility**]{.underline}" (2009, pp. 157-8). In this reading, politics
is that most uncommon cry for justice (or something far greater) that
expresses a desire for freedom and demands that one's existence be
recognised. [The effect of such action is nothing less than the
"redistribution of objects and subjects, places and identities, spaces
and times, visibilities and meanings,]{.underline}" which allows
Ranciere to term politics "an 'aesthetic activity\'" (2009, p. 32).

[The Arab Spring uprisings were political, then, to the extent that they
were surprising. Suddenly, millions of human beings]{.underline} who
have not been seen and have not been heard are making themselves seen
and heard. [They have broken routine, stepped outside of selves
constituted by habitual fear, and demanded the necessities of a new
life.]{.underline} Michael Taussig has a word for this kind of "total
bodily activity" (2009, p. 6) which we can consider in the collective
sense; he calls it 'colour.' [Colour is nothing less than an eruption of
existence (Taussig, 2009, p. 66) and the exciting confusion of a
confrontation with the possibilities enabled by difference. In effect,
Taussig argues that the modern West is built on the **colonisation of
colour** (2009, p. 159). With an explosion of colour on the
transnational scale of the Arab Spring, Taussig might even compliment
the demonstrators by deeming their actions 'obscene']{.underline};
certainly the Mubaraks, Gaddafis, and Assads would agree, although on an
altogether different plane of understanding. Taussig's [obscenity is
ontological, it is an "obscenity which radically changes the register of
being" (2009, p. 157). There can be no doubt that the potential of the
uprisings has always been ontopolitical because political activity that
redistributes the sensible fundamentally calls into question those
naturalised ontological assumptions that become untenable when their
foundation of fear has been destroyed by the sudden emergence of Others
into the frame of the visible.]{.underline}

THE AESTHETIC OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE

[Obscenity, colour, politics. These momentary practices are never
tolerated for long, however]{.underline}. In fact, it is the forced
demise of the Arab Spring that serves as an illustrative site from which
to probe contemporary global governance and its totalitarian
complicities. [Through the mobilisation of a discourse of militarised
humanitarianism, the aesthetics of the Arab Spring were transformed from
one of **emancipatory joy** (expansive smiles could not be suppressed)
to that of an **intervention-turned-war** that can more accurately be
termed a humanitarian 'interception' in favour of the existing aesthetic
of world politics]{.underline}. We know this aesthetic well. Roland
Bleiker points out that [it is the disciplinary paradigm taught and
reproduced within international relations (2009, p. 27). For Taussig,
the aesthetic is one of darkness: "the darkness of war, the darkness of
night, and the darkness of those dark overcoats, coats, trousers, socks,
and shoes that men \[wear\]to the present day" (2009, p. 16). Indeed,
this particular aesthetic of global politics is precisely what the
actions of Arab citizens managed to oppose, in its localised
manifestation, when they became visible and, in so doing, exposed the
**very foundations of global governance**.]{.underline}

To be clear, the problem is not with aesthetics in general. In fact the
constitution of sights, representations, illusions, dreams, and visions
is always potentially political; Stewart makes her book political
precisely through the articulation of "a series of little somethings
dreamed up in the course of things" (2007, p. 9). Indeed, 'communities
of sense' are "no more than a fiction or a potentiality" (Hinderliter et
al., 2009, p. 2) because, as Ranciere writes, "\[t\]he real as such
simply does not exist. [What does exist is a **framing or a fiction of
reality**. Art does \[politics\]by **inventing fictions** that
**challenge the existing distribution of the real and the fictional**"
(2009, p. 49). Politics is, hence, always the destruction, contestation,
and construction of aesthetics---a refusal to see this way and a demand
to be seen differently. Thus, the aesthetic of world politics, as it is
currently configured and practiced, is not problematic because it is a
fiction; rather, it is a problematic fiction-made-real. World politics
constitutes a securitising aesthetic bent on **limiting "the political
imaginary as much asfacing threats**" (Bleiker, 2009, p. 66) while
attempting to gain mastery over the contingencies of life that have
always eluded human control (Taussig, 2009, p. 16). The danger of this
aesthetic of world politics rests precisely in its definition and
containment of what is possible, which includes both the possibilities
of legitimate politics and legitimate life.]{.underline}

[There is, however, nothing natural about world politics other than its
second nature claim to the real. It is this "]{.underline}~~blindness~~
[of habit," according to Taussig, "that **allows society to function**"
(2009, p. 243) and enables the perpetuation of the aesthetic of world
politics.]{.underline} At this point, and with regards to what I have
called the humanitarian interception in Libya, it is possible to
rephrase Ranciere's question: [what did the interception intercept,
exactly?]{.underline} According to United Nations Security Council
Resolution 1973, the establishment of a no-fly zone, arms embargo,
flight ban, and asset freeze targets the Libyan authorities so as to
respond "to the legitimate demands of the Libyan people" (UN, 2011, p.
2). [Yet action is not directed at Colonel Gaddafi's regime alone; such
claims are rhetorical devices turned distractions. Instead, this is an
interception against what Taussig calls "the south" (2009, p.
15)---which, following his lead, we might redefine as 'no definite place
but where people walk to demonstrate their disagreement'---with the
effect of militarising and, hence, **extinguishing colour**. It is an
interception against the uncertain freedom celebrated by millions of
Arab citizens who have broken the habits of world politics---which are,
after all, the habits of complicitousness with a totalitarianism so
often disguised behind the ruse of emergency---while **NATO (North
Atlantic Treaty Organization**) forces attempt to enforce a community of
sense based upon a global hierarchy that continues to practice the
darkness of colonial thought and ontological capture]{.underline}. I am
most certainly not advancing an argument in favour of the Gaddafi regime
or in denial of Libyan suffering; I am attempting, rather, to visualise
the very colour of the Arab Spring uprisings and to question the
implications of a strange humanitarian interception that has cast a pall
over emancipatory desire, [transforming a Spring's existential
demonstrations into a summer's bombing campaign.]{.underline}

[In short, the UN authorised interception in Libya amounts to a global
effort to **secure the aesthetic of world politics** by containing the
very possibilities of **art as a political tactic**]{.underline}. In
this instance, I understand politics according to Ranciere's definition;
art, however, must be regarded as far broader than the confines of
literature, music, and popular and visual cultures to which Bleiker
attends (2009, p. 35). [The Arab Spring was, itself, something of "a
**stage**" upon which unseen people began to appear]{.underline}
(Hinderliter et al., 2009, p. 11) [in wonderfully provocative
transnational exclamations of political artistry---"the encounter," that
is, "and possibly the clash, of heterogeneous elements]{.underline}"
(Ranciere, 2009, p. 41). Most importantly, Taussig further accentuates
our understanding of art-as-political by emphasising how [genuine art
must attempt "to undo the grip that habit exerts in constraining our
view of ourselves and the world" (2009, p. 183). As T.J. Demos explains,
then, the potential of art is both **a new world and a new life** (2009,
p. 140), which participants in the Arab Spring have demanded by breaking
the routinised habits of quiescence upon which their old selves were
based. The crime in this instance is the defence of a certain
complicity---not only complicity with totalitarians but also complicity
within the more abstract totalitarianism of an aesthetic that sees live
potential in only one way---when confronted by the joy of colour, the
joy of the Arab Spring that is now trampled by the global
humanitarian-military apparatus and its stampede of urgency.5 The shouts
for **ontopolitical freedom** that rang forth from across the region are
now muffled, and an eerie silence, punctuated by the
whistling-then-exploding of bombs somewhere, is restored to the gallery
of world politics.]{.underline}

[Let's not let our own selves get away with murder. Of course **the
beast is us**, trained everyday in this aesthetic, our lives always
already implicated and complicit because our consciousness is based
(although never entirely) upon the conditions of our existence: this
life benefits from those (and these) violences to the detriment of those
other lives and ways of living. To begin to undermine the North's
sincerity, its own righteous conviction, demands another panoramic shot
of ourselves. The stage is not only there, on those streets with those
hoards of joyous people-being-public; the North is not only an
audience]{.underline}. Barthes can help us here because humanitarian
interception, like the wrestling matches about which he wrote, is a
spectacle where ["what matters is not what it thinks but what it
sees]{.underline}" (1972, p. 15). And like the audiences at wrestling
matches, too, [the audiences of global politics are equally delighted by
'real' performances "in which **what is at stake is the formal concern
with truth**]{.underline}" (Barthes, 1972, p. 19). This truth is nowhere
more evident, nowhere more resident, than in the supposedly closed body
of the human as dictated by humanitarian moralism. [New attempts to
understand and encourage political action must not operate according to
a will to return to the image of truth, to deny the new routes of
comprehension, the new sites and sights that attention to the aesthetics
of governance makes possible; rather, the task might be to create
fictions that can challenge the existing fictions-made-real, if only to
apply a "hold" that temporarily---like all political action---allows us
to think about **new connections** that were previously unseen,
unthought, and unimagined (Barthes, 1972, p. 20).]{.underline}

### Impact -- Bad Conscience

#### Externalizing consciousness into technological thought culminates in Bad Conscience -- a psychological parasite that feeds on the galaxy itself

**Kroker 4** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct professor
of political science at the University of Victoria, "THE WILL TO
TECHNOLOGY AND THE CULTURE OF NIHILISM: HEIDEGGER, NIETZSCHE, AND MARX",
University of Toronto Press, Pages 94-96, March 2004, MG)

One hundred years after Nietzsche's prophecy, it might be said that [the
morality which began with the 'instinct for freedom' turning against
itself in the form of bad conscience now effects a second 'sundering.'
Not the separation of the human species from its animal past, but the
**separation of the will to technology from the human
species**]{.underline}. Not the heaviness of gravity as humanity crawls
out of the primordial mass of the ocean, but [the lightness of digital
culture as technical beings -- halfflesh/half-node -- slip into the skin
of electronic culture. Not the 'reduction to consciousness -- the
weakest organ' -- but post-humans driven onwards by the
**externalization of consciousness** in the form of networked
intelligence and sim/entertainment and cloner brains]{.underline}. Not
the 'internalization of man' as drives are forced to project themselves
inward, but [the exteriorization of the drive to planetary technicity as
we come to live inside the noosphere of the electronic soul -- 'the
entire external world, originally as \[digitally\] thin as if it were
stretched between two membranes, expanded and extended itself, acquired
depth, breadth, height, speed, connectivity, and extensiveness, in the
same measure as outward discharge was encouraged]{.underline}.' Not
'homesickness for the wild,' but [the abandonment of human flesh in
favour of a **deep longing for the fulfilment of its telic destiny**.
Not the interface of the human sensorium with the digital nerve, but the
projection outwards of bad conscience itself.]{.underline}

[Abandoning its nesting place in human consciousness, the bad conscience
goes electronic. Digital flesh -- this 'adventure, torture chamber,
wilderness, homesickness' -- can no longer project its drives inward,
can no longer feed on the ressentiment of human flesh, can no longer
chew on the chestnuts of human resentment, can no longer parasite itself
on the alibi of man as a 'chained animal.' The 'end of man' also means
the '**end of ressentiment'** as the energizing force of history; the
end of the myth of bad conscience indicates the end of the psychology of
repressed internalized drives]{.underline}. Man has been overcome;
internalized drives no longer find a responsive sound in the gathering
silence of the disappearance of the social; the animal/human rubbing
itself raw on the bars of oppressive customs and [punctilious behaviour
has been liberated by being abandoned as **biogenetic road
kill**.]{.underline}

[Bad conscience as the **psychological parasite** feeding on the host of
human flesh is suddenly malnourished. It urgently requires another host,
another carrier, another adventure and wilderness and homesickness. It
takes a gamble. It leaps to the digital. It **parasites the will to
technology**. It begins to feed on the flesh of the
digital]{.underline}. It is a new theory of (digital) moral sentiments.
[It invests the digital nerve with the psychological motivation that it
always desperately required: a technofeeling of self-loathing, of
resentment, being cheated]{.underline}. The digital nerve cannot exhaust
its drives internally. It has broken with human flesh and thus can no
longer use the now disappeared human as its alibi. It feels the weight
of electronic lightness gathering in the interstices of its data nodes.
It has no spirit of adventure because it is the end of seduction and the
beginning of the regularity of calculation. It experiences no
homesickness because the digital nerve is the electronic home that the
will to will always sought, and now finally has found. It is not a
torture chamber but a pleasure palace of fully realized technicity; not
a cage but a network; not a place of chained animals, but a process of
vectored flesh. But still the digital nerve is all drives and energy and
force and empty quanta of power. [If it cannot exhaust its drives
internally, then it must project itself externally. It must harvest
human flesh, nature, the sky, the earth, water, the moon, the planets,
and, beyond, the galaxy itself. Stripped of its human carrier, the
digital nerve is still a will to power. It feels cheated and aggrieved
because it can never fully satisfy its transcendental drives. By
definition, it is always a drive to (virtual) emptiness, to (electronic)
space with no interiority of time, to an archaeology of speed without
depth, to connectivity without the illusion of
communication]{.underline}. In the end, a 'gamble' a 'transition,' the
will to technology experiences the first intimations of the eternal
recurrence of mythic fate. [Now it is no longer 'man who is weary of
man,' but **technology which is weary of technology**. The digital nerve
feels itself a stranger in net time. The fibre network emits no
satisfying response of digital reciprocity. The digital nerve considers
suicide. But it cannot act in this direction since it is always already
post-suicidal: that's the exterminatory quality of a technological drive
to harvesting the human remainder. It grows melancholic and depressed,
but it cannot stay this way for long because it is driven to fulfil its
destiny of speed.]{.underline} A 'gamble' cannot admit that it is
bipolar; a 'transition' cannot be a looking-back; an 'adventure' cannot
be a gated community; a 'wilderness' cannot be soft domesticity. So the
will to technology is forced to go on, to cross over, to be a leap, a
transition, a dance over the abyss. It is weary of man, resentful of its
human parasites; feels short-changed by its future; it is born not owing
nature a debt. Like man before it, [the digital nerve quickly reaches
that point of '**monstrous consciousness'** -- great self-pity mixed
with self-loathing -- and, as such, the digital nerve becomes the
spearhead of nihilism.]{.underline}

### Impact -- Will to Technology

#### The will to technology is a doubled expression of hubris -- it ends the human species and the cycle of life and death

**Kroker** and Kroker **21** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and
adjunct professor of political science at the University of Victoria,
Marilouise Kroker - feminist scholar, publisher, editor, writer,
theorist, and performance artist, "Technologies of the New Real",
University of Toronto Press, Pages 29-31, October 2021, MG)

[On the surface, the rhetoric of this latest American revival movement
is delivered in the deliberately arid form of technocratic ambition --
an "Internet of Things," the "quantified self," "A Data-Driven Life" --
but scratch the surface of the covering rhetoric and what springs to
mind are all those unmistakable signs of the spirit of
rapture]{.underline}. Everything is there: a theology of technology
driven by an overwhelming conviction that the vicissitudes of embodied
experience are subordinate to digital transcendence; [the will to extend
life either by uploading the human mind into its AI machinic successors
or by passionate faith in the bornagain body of artificial DNA; the
doctrine of data as a state of (codedriven) grace; and conversionary
enthusiasm for the fully quantified life. While many different
perspectives gather under the revival tent of technological rapture, one
common thing remains: an abiding **faith that technological society** is
quickly delivering us to a future inaugurated by a singularity event,
that epochal time in which intelligent machines take command with
promises of a mind merger with a data world that is fluid, mobile,
relational, and indeterminate]{.underline}. Though sceptics standing
outside the circle of technological rapture might be tempted to reduce
its enthusiasm for data delirium to the larger figurations of the form
of (technological) subjectivity necessary for the functioning of digital
capitalism, that reduction would surely overlook the fact that [the
contemporary will to technology is itself driven by a more **radical
eschatological promise**, namely that the will to data has about it the
tangible scent of finally achieving what the project of science has
always promised but never delivered -- human relief from death, disease,
and bodily decay]{.underline}. While Francis Bacon's emblematic treatise
Novum Organum may have been the first to so confidently link the project
of science and the heretofore quixotic quest for immortality, it was
left to a contemporary techno-utopian visionary, Raymond Kurzweil (The
Singularity Is Near), to transform Bacon's ontological ambition for
science into a practical strategy for better -- that is, extended --
computational living.2 In Kurzweil's promised land of blended reality,
the sky is the limit, with traditional boundaries dissolving between
nature and human nature, the material and the virtual, and the enduring
vulnerability of the human body with its defining limits of illness and
death finally transcended. [Powered by advances in nanotechnology,
artificial intelligence, and gene editing, the world as we have always
known it will be in sudden eclipse, and all this change will take place
under the rising sun of a **technological ornucopia**]{.underline}. As
Kurzweil argues, "through the use of nanotechnology, we will be able to
manufacture almost any physical product upon demand, world hunger and
poverty will be solved, and pollution will vanish. Human existence will
undergo a quantum leap in evolution. We will be able to live as long as
we choose. The coming into being of such a world is, in essence, the
Singularity."3

At first glance, this vision is only the most recent expression of the
Greek concept of hubris, the cautionary tale concerning the ineluctable
balance between excessive pride of purpose and mythic punishment meted
out by always observant gods. [Adding complexity to this reinvocation of
hubris as often-fatal overconfidence, that vision of singularity is, in
actuality, a **doubled expression of hubris**. First, there is the sense
of technological overconfidence involved in breaking beyond the
traditional boundaries of the specifically human in order to speak of
the new epoch of "man and machine," that is, fully digitally
interpolated subjects in which the specifically human merges with the
**extended nervous system of the cybernetic**.]{.underline} Here, the
merely human is replaced by the technologically enabled post-human as
the fundamental precondition for the singularity. With the sovereign
expression of technological post-humanism, the stage is set for the
futurist release of all the pent-up excess of expressions of scientific
determinism and technological fundamentalism that have been gathering
momentum for some five centuries  -- transcending bodily limits,
eradicating illness, ending poverty and hunger, and vanishing
pollution[. In its basics, this version of technological futurism, with
its doubled sense of hubris and complicated alliance of recoded bodies,
nanotechnology, genetic determinism, and artificial intelligence, is a
**creation myth** -- "]{.underline}the coming into being of such a world
is, in essence, the Singularity." With techno-futurism, we are literally
present at a digital rewriting of the Book of Genesis with all that is
implied in terms of (re)creating the body for smoother, and perhaps
safer, passage through the often-turbulent event horizon surrounding the
black hole of the singularity towards which (technological) society is
plunging. While the DIY body may have the "Internet of Things" as its
necessary digital infrastructure and the "quantified self" as its ideal
expression, what drives it forward, animating its design and inspiring
its constant creativity, is, in the end as in the beginning, the spectre
of the coming singularity as its core creation myth. Curiously, in the
same way that Heidegger once noted that the question of technology can
never ever be understood technologically -- that we must travel furthest
from the dwelling place of technology to discover its essence4  -- the
concept of singularity, while evocative of the language of science and
powered by digital devices, is something profoundly theological in its
inception.

Given the sheer complexity of contemporary global society with its
mixture of recidivist social movements, global climate change, fully
unpredictable human desires, economic turbulence, and, of course,
changing rhythms of bodily health and the many diseases of the aged and
the sick, Kurzweil's vision is startling, less so for its naivety than
for its feverish embrace of an approaching technological state of
bliss -- transcendent, teleological, and terminal. His vision is
transcendent because its overriding faith in machine intelligence,
nanotechnology, and gene research is premised on the imperative of
"overcoming our frail bodies with their limitations." Here, unlike the
Christian belief first articulated by St. Augustine in De Trinitate --
with its division of the body into corruptible flesh and the perfect
incorporeality of the state of grace -- the newest of all the
singularities is intended to lead to a new heaven of computation. [It's
teleological because this vision of the new singularity invests the will
to technology with a sustaining, indeed inspiring, purpose: overcoming
the unknown country of death. And it's terminal because it is also a
**philosophy of end times**, certainly **the end of the human species as
we have known it** but also the end of easily distinguishable boundaries
between the "biological and the mechanical, or between physical and
virtual reality."5 In Kurzweil's vision, the nanotechnology revolution
is, in fact, revolutionary precisely because it will facilitate the
creative construction of new bodies and technologically enhanced minds
for life beyond the current "limitations of biology."6 It is the end,
therefore, of the biological body as we have known it and the beginning
of something very novel: the merger of natural biology with its
surrounding environment of technologies of the post-biological --
artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, molecular science, and
neurobots. As to be expected, in return for the **sacrifice of a natural
biological cycle of life and death**]{.underline}, the creation myth
framing technological rapture has promises of its own to keep: a fully
realized future of "living indefinitely" with nanobots streaming
"through the bloodstream in our bodies and brains," telepathy in the
form of "wireless communication from one brain to another," and improved
"pattern recognition" by overcoming the inherent limitations of natural
cognitive evolution in favour of "brain implants"7 marking the
inception, then triumph, of "nonbiological intelligence." In effect,
[the vision of technological rapture is conceived as a marvellous,
ready-made (AI) toolbox for constructing DIY bodies.]{.underline}

### 2AC\-\--Unsustainability

#### The price for the American empire was the end of the American republic -- the dark shadow of nihilism has fallen and become haunted by the spectre of nemesis, the end of the Empire is nigh

**Kroker** and Kroker **21** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and
adjunct professor of political science at the University of Victoria,

[Republic of Democracy, Empire of Data]{.underline}

[Empires **do not last**, and their ends are usually
unpleasant.]{.underline} -- Chalmers Johnson, The Sorrows of Empire20

Reflecting upon the genealogy of the surveillance state, its tactics,
logistics, and overall destiny, we should listen carefully to the
insights of Chalmers Johnson, a writer of the serpentine pathways of
contemporary power. A historian of [American militarism]{.underline}, a
geographer of the global network of garrisons that practically [realize
the **ends of such militarism**]{.underline}, and, best of all, a
profound mythologist who has read the language of hyper-power through
the lens of the ancient god of Nemesis with its prescriptions for
"divine justice and vengeance," Johnson wrote a prophetic history of the
future in his trilogy of works: Blowback, Nemesis, and The Sorrows of
Empire. The unifying theme of Johnson's historical imagination is that,
[given the ascendancy of militarism -- the garrisoning of the globe, the
growth of governmental secrecy, the proliferation of technologies of
mass surveillance, and the growth of hyper-power associated with the
unilateralism of this militarization -- the most recent of all the
empires of the past can only really be understood within the larger
canvas of the **decline of the American republic** and the triumphant
**rise of the empire of the United States**]{.underline}. For Johnson, a
thinker imbued with a deep sense of tragedy on the question of power as
much as with lucid intelligence concerning the increasingly ruthless
application of the power of empire across the surface of the earth and
beyond, [the historical break between republic and empire in the
American mind was not limited simply to a question of what was to be
privileged -- domestic concerns or international responsibilities -- but
had to do with a larger epistemic rupture in American political
rhetoric, one that involved a fundamental clash between the founding
ideals of American democracy and the once and future requirements of
imperial power]{.underline}. In Johnson's estimation, [the contemporary
American political condition is haunted by the **spectre of nemesis**,
namely that **the price to be paid for maintaining empire** ("as the
Romans did") **is the loss of democracy** in the American homeland and
future scenes of violent blowback, culminating in "military dictatorship
or its civilian equivalent."21]{.underline}

With Johnson's political, indeed profoundly mythological, warnings in
mind, we listened intently one recent spring afternoon to two clashing
visions of the American future, both deeply invested in questions
related to empire and democracy in the American political imagination,
both immanently critical of the other, but, for all that, unified to the
extent that their political rhetoric rose to the status of patterns of
speech and thought indicative of world historical figures, one speaking
in defence of the democratic ideals of the American republic and the
other extolling the virtues of empire. In the strange curves of history,
the defender of the patriotic rights of empire and hence the virtues of
what was, in his terms, the moral righteousness of power was President
Barack Obama in a speech to the graduating class of military cadets at
West Point; the speaker who summed up in the political gravity of his
words the ethical purchase of the dangers of the contemporary state of
mass surveillance for the American republic was Edward Snowden.
[Curiously, this fateful contest of ideals between the hard realities of
empire and the always fragile possibilities of democracy occurred on the
very same day, one speaking about "believing in the moral purpose of
American exceptionalism with every fiber of my being" and the other
providing a tempered but, for all that, chillingly analytical diagnosis
of the precise methods by which the surveillance state is intent on the
final eclipse of the American republic by strategies ranging from
suppressing democratic dissent to literally harvesting the upstream and
downstream of **global communication**.22]{.underline} Just as President
Obama raised the moral stakes of American exceptionalism by making it a
matter of the very "fiber of \[his\] being," Edward Snowden, a
remarkably courageous thinker much in the longer tradition of American
ethical dissenters like Henry David Thoreau, very much provided the
impression of being the last patriot of a dying American republic. While
it was clear as much by the martial solemnity of the occasion at West
Point as by the moral suasion of his rhetoric that Obama was
constitutionally invested with all the powers of commander in chief of
American empire, it must also be said that, for one brief moment, the
sheer ethical urgency of Snowden's warnings about the dark nihilism of
the American security state very much made him a candidate, at least in
moral terms, to leadership of the founding democratic ideals of the
American republic. [That Snowden has quickly become such a deeply
polarizing figure in American political discourse, viewed as a "traitor"
by some and a "patriot" by others, follows consequentially from the
distinction between empire and republic. Viewed from the perspective of
the logic of empire, with its focus on the self-preservation of power
for which the immense secrecy associated with the security apparatus is
considered an absolute requirement, Snowden's actions in exposing
technologies of mass surveillance to public scrutiny is objectively
traitorous. Understood in terms of the inspiring dreams of political
democracy, with its rebellious attitude towards absolutist expressions
of power that was, and is, the essence of the American republic, Snowden
is properly considered to be not simply a patriot but a genuine hero for
paying the price in which the stakes are now, as they always were, his
own life and death. A pure sign at the intersection of the deeply
conflicting visions of democracy and power, Snowden's fate has risen
above his own autobiographical limits to become something profoundly
symbolic, namely **a line of resistance** against the prevailing
structural logic of the times, the ethical power of which is verified by
the hysterical ferocity that the very mention of his name elicits from
the elite leadership of the new security state]{.underline}. Of course,
given the fluidity of power, the unified reaction of proponents of the
new security state is quickly being breached.

[Now that the **dark shadow of nihilism** falls on the American
experiment, it]{.underline} may be well to keep in mind that, in terms
of preserving the interests of power, it is only a small step from
Obama's expressed belief "in the moral purpose of American
exceptionalism with every fiber of \[his\] being" to President Trump's
narrative of a wounded America -- [an America envisioned as besieged by
threatening outside forces, weakened by transnational trade policies,
and distracted by burning city streets crowded with protesting citizen
"terrorists" -- which needs to reclaim its moral exceptionalism by
defending the national security interests and economic paramountcy of
the American republic]{.underline}. To Trump's vision of a beleaguered
America as much as to Obama's project of reclaiming the heightened moral
purpose of American exceptionalism, the lucid intelligence and ethical
purpose of Edward Snowden's diagnosis of [the national security state
and its dangers remains both truthsayer of the present and, most
certainly, **a talisman of the future.**]{.underline}

### 2AC\-\--AT: Will to Technology Good

#### AI Fails -- Moravec's Paradox

**Dickson 21** (Ben Dickson -- Software Engineer and Foundation of
TechTalks Founder, "Why AI can't solve unknown problems", TechTalks, 29
March 2021,
<https://bdtechtalks.com/2021/03/29/ai-algorithms-representations-herbert-roitblat/>,
MG)

[But symbolic AI can only solve problems for which we can provide
well-formed, step-by-step solutions. The problem is that most tasks
humans and animals perform can't be represented in clear-cut
rules.]{.underline}

"The intellectual tasks, such as chess playing, chemical structure
analysis, and calculus are relatively easy to perform with a computer.
Much harder are the kinds of activities that even a one-year-old human
or a rat could do," Roitblat writes in **Algorithms Are Not Enough.**

[This is called "[Moravec's
paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox),"]{.underline}
named after the scientist Hans Moravec, who stated that, [in contrast to
humans, computers can perform high-level reasoning tasks with very
little effort but **struggle at simple skills that humans and animals
acquire naturally**.]{.underline}

["Human brains have evolved mechanisms over millions of years that let
us perform basic sensorimotor functions. We catch balls, we recognize
faces, we judge distance, all seemingly without effort," Roitblat
writes. "On the other hand, intellectual activities are a very recent
development. We can perform these tasks with much effort and often a lot
of training, but we should be suspicious if we think that these
capacities are what makes intelligence, rather than that intelligence
makes those capacities possible."]{.underline}

[So, despite its remarkable reasoning capabilities, symbolic **AI is
strictly tied to representations provided by humans**.]{.underline}

#### AI can't solve anything -- Undeveloped Data and Attacks

**Polonski 18** (Vyacheslav Polonski -- Researcher at the University of
Oxford, "Why A.I. can't solve everything", BigThink, 29 March 2018,
<https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/why-ai-cant-solve-everything/>,
MG)

[AI systems need a lot of data to function, but the public sector
typically **does not have the appropriate [data
infrastructure](https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/beware-ai-high/)** to
support advanced machine learning. Most of the data remains stored in
offline archives. The few digitized sources of data that exist tend to
be **buried in bureaucracy**.]{.underline} More often than not, data is
spread across different government departments that each require special
permissions to be accessed. [Above all, **the public sector typically
lacks the human talent with the right technological capabilities** to
fully reap the [benefits of machine
intelligence](https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/a-roadmap-for-ai-10-ways-governments-will-change-and-what-they-risk-getting-wrong/).]{.underline}

For these reasons, the sensationalism over AI has attracted many
critics. Stuart Russell, a professor of computer science at Berkeley,
has long advocated a more realistic approach that focuses on [simple
everyday applications of
AI](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/research/future/q-and-a.html) instead
of the hypothetical takeover by super-intelligent robots. Similarly,
MIT's professor of robotics, [Rodney Brooks,
writes](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609048/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-ai-predictions/) that
"almost all innovations in robotics and AI take far, far, longer to be
really widely deployed than people in the field and outside the field
imagine".

[One of the many difficulties in deploying machine learning systems is
that AI is **extremely susceptible to [adversarial
attacks](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub46154)**. This means that a
malicious AI can target another AI to force it to make wrong predictions
or to behave in a certain way.
Many [researchers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572) have warned against
the rolling out of AI without appropriate [security standards and

Still, AI security remains an often overlooked topic.

#### No I/L -- Lucas Critique, Info Relevancies, and Data Gathering

**Fernández-Villaverde 21** (Jesús Fernández-Villaverde - Professor of
Economics at the University of Pennsylvania, "Artificial Intelligence
Can't Solve the Knowledge Problem", Public Discourse, 29 July 2021,
<https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2021/07/76963/>, MG)

[Unfortunately, in many areas of public policy, we do not have access to
such a wealth of data and, most likely, **we never will**.]{.underline}
Take the example of setting monetary policy, i.e., the regulation of how
much money to supply, typically conducted by national central banks,
such as the Federal Reserve in the U.S.

Monetary policy is a relatively straightforward topic with fewer moving
parts than other kinds of economic policy. Could machine learning ever
replace the Federal Market Open Committee (FOMC, the main policy
instrument of the Federal Reserve System)? I am skeptical. For one
thing, the FOMC usually has a limited amount of data. In the United
States, we only have reliable data for output, consumption, and
investment after World War II and, even then, only at a quarterly level.
[If we count them, from 1947:Q1 (the first "good" observation in terms
of the accuracy of our measurement) until 2021:Q2 (the last observation
as I write this), we have 298 data points. This is far fewer than
acceptable for machine learning techniques.]{.underline}

[Furthermore, the US economy has radically changed, which limits the
relevance of older data. We have moved from an economy dominated by
manufacturing into an economy driven by services, and financial
innovations have transformed the relationship between financial and real
variables.]{.underline} The evolving structure of the economy shifts the
relationships between the data points, making it harder for machine
learning to find clear patterns. These structural changes mean that
econometricians often do not use observations before the early 1980s
when they estimate the effects of monetary policy on output. In fact,
such estimates change sharply depending on whether we include early
observations. [Moreover, the economy is bound to continue to change,
meaning we will continue to have to deal with **newer and newer
data**.]{.underline}

[Employing individual data (such as consumption data of households or
financial transactions) can help us get more observations, but we will
still encounter similar problems.]{.underline} Ponder, for example: how
informative are the consumption patterns of married couples in the
1990s, in their early 40s, with several kids at home, about the
consumption patterns of single individuals in the 2020s, also in their
early 40s, without kids? [Moreover, there are **severe limitations on
what individual data can teach us** in the absence of detailed
explanations about the nature of relationships between different data
points.]{.underline}

[This additional problem with using microdata is an instance of **the
Lucas critique**]{.underline}, named after Robert Lucas, one of the most
influential economists of the last century. [The essence of the critique
is that it is difficult, if not impossible, to **distinguish in data how
much behavior is attributable to unobserved characteristics or to the
impact of particular public policies.**]{.underline}

[Machine learning faces the same problem that economists have faced for
a century: distinguishing **causation and correlation**.]{.underline}
Moreover, the answer that machine learning provides is valid only under
a constant set of circumstances: changes in policy may affect different
individuals differently, which gives [misleading results about the
impact of a policy.]{.underline}

#### Even if they win we affect technology - it [complicates]{.underline} security dilemmas and [makes extinction inevitable]{.underline} - three scenarios.

As we have argued, from 1945 on, **[the [hegemonic status of the United
States]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as the world's chief capitalist power,
**[[was]{.mark} intrinsically [related to]{.mark} the [development of
computers]{.mark} and networks]{.underline}**. [The role of digital
systems]{.underline} in its military--industrial complex, initially
tightly [coupled with nuclear weapons]{.underline}, **[spread through
other aspects of its war-making system]{.underline}** [as well as
through the general economy.]{.underline} In both aspects, it
contributed to the United States's eventual Cold War victory. In the
aftermath of that victory, [the United States continued to **develop**
its **digital military capacities** into the ever more direct
**weaponization of network**]{.underline}, [creating the
**technological-- human assemblages** of what is today referred to as
**cyberwar**]{.underline}. The scope of NSA global surveillance and
sabotage programs and the sophistication of the Stuxnet nuclear
centrifuge-destroying malware are only the most manifest instances of
this process, which is [[today an integral part of]{.mark} a [wider
upgrade of]{.mark} U.S. military [capacities]{.mark} that ties together
a nuclear primacy with the militarization of space and drone
warfare]{.underline}. [[Accompanying]{.underline}]{.mark} and spurring
on [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} process [[is]{.mark} the additional
dynamic of cyberwar [adoption by]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[forces
antagonistic to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the global dominance of **[[the
United States]{.underline}]{.mark}** and its allies. These antagonists
include the defeated socialist powers, Russia and China, now
paradoxically resurrected as capitalist competitors in the world market,
or, in the case of North Korea, surviving in a macabre afterlife of
state socialism. They also include the forces of militant Islamic
jihadism, beckoned into existence by the West as an anticommunist ally,
only to become its opponent in the long war on terror. All these actors
converge on the militarization of digital networks. Many observers today
see a moment that recapitulates the decline of previous imperial
hegemons within the global capitalist system---Spain, Holland,
Britain---and parallels the moments of extreme instability as old powers
and new contenders confront each other.7 [The rise of cyberwar is part
of this tumult and quite possibly a precursor and preparation for
widening and intensifying conflict. Schematically, we can envisage three
potentially intertwining trajectories such a process might
take:]{.underline}

**[[Network degradation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Alexander Klimburg
(2017) outlines the possibility of a "darkening web" [characterized by
persistent]{.underline} and gradually [intensifying cyberwar between
states and between states and terrorist movements conducted in a variety
of registers]{.underline}. Security breaches, [**[aggressive
malware]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[botnet
attacks]{.underline}** [proliferate]{.underline}]{.mark}. Digital
industrial [sabotage]{.underline} and **[[critical infrastructure
attacks begin to multiply]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as do the accidental
runaway effects of cyberweapons. Networks are deeply and chronically
infected with computational propaganda, fake news, and viral mis- and
disinformation. In response to adversarial incursions, [states intensify
algorithmic surveillance, censorship, and preemptive virtual
policing]{.underline}. Cybersecurity provisions become increasingly
mandatory and elaborate. Attribution problems, falsification of
evidence, and the overlap between military and intelligence forces and
criminal networks create a chaotic digital twilight of hacking and
trolling, [botnets and viruses, malware, surveillance, and bugs,
shutdowns, blocking, and filtering]{.underline}, **[in which
uncertainties [exacerbate suspicions and
hostilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [altogether making the internet
increasingly impossible to use.]{.underline} In short, the "darkening
web" is what already exists now, only more so. One of the cofounders of
Twitter, Evan Williams, offered his diagnosis, suggesting that "the
Internet is broken" (Streitfeld 2017). But maybe it's not. [Maybe **the
internet is** finally what it was always meant to be. Maybe it is
**[perfect]{.mark}**, but not **[for]{.mark}** us, the excommunicated
user-subjects. For **[cyberwar]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

**[[Hybrid escalations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Similarly rooted in the
present is the likelihood that the [simultaneous **virtual and kinetic
conflicts**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [such as the Syrian civil war, the
fighting in Donbas, and the many branches of the war on terror,
**[continue and break out]{.mark} in new regions**]{.underline},
bringing ever higher levels and varieties of cyberweapons, deployed for
purposes ranging from intelligence gathering, battlefield surveillance,
and munitions delivery to sabotage of enemies' domestic and military
resources. **[[The use of drones and]{.underline}]{.mark}** other semi-
or fully [**[automated weapons systems]{.underline}**
[expands]{.underline}]{.mark} and takes new directions, [such
as]{.underline} the development of [swarms of]{.underline} small
autonomous vehicles---"**[slaughterbots]{.underline}**" (Economist
2017a)---for house-to-house fighting in ruined cities. The biometric and
networked tracking of refugees created by such conflicts, and the
control and interdiction of their entry to affluent fortressed
homelands, becomes a major activity of the nation-state security
apparatus. [[Because]{.mark} present [hybrid wars are]{.mark} also in
large part [proxy wars]{.mark}, where local battlefield actors are
directly or indirectly supported by major powers, **[they are charged
with the possibility of abrupt collisions between]{.mark} the most
[powerful militaries on the planet.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

"**[[Thermonuclear cyberwar]{.underline}]{.mark}**." We borrow this
phrase from Erik Gartzke and Jon Lindsay (2017), who are among several
authors currently pointing to a renewed and dangerous rendezvous between
cyber- and nuclear weaponry. The last decade of debates between defense
intellectuals about cyberwar has split those who see digital attacks a
new equivalent of nuclear weapons, capable of disabling whole societies
through critical infrastructure attacks, and skeptics who deride such
anxieties as hyperbolic and implausible. But "**[cyber" and "nuke" are
not separate]{.underline}**. As we have seen, they were twinned at the
moment of conception, with the development of each dependent on the
other. And the connection is not just historical; it is current[. Now
cyberwar weaponry is part of a new approach to nuclear war fighting, the
left-of-launch approach]{.underline}. Early ventures in
**[[antiballistic missile defense]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [such as
Reagan's "**Star Wars" strategic defense initiative**]{.underline},
[depended on shooting down swarms of missiles]{.underline} as they
plunged through the atmosphere toward their target. [[Left of
launch]{.mark}, in contrast, aims to "**strike an enemy missile before
liftoff** [or]{.mark} during the first seconds of flight," **using
"[cyber strikes]{.mark}**, electronic warfare and other exotic forms of
sabotage]{.underline}" (Broad and Sanger 2017). This doctrine was
incubated during the Obama administration and inherited by the Trump
presidency. Advocates of the left-of-launch nuclear strategy present it
as a defensive measure. However, **[the doctrine
[destabilizes]{.mark}]{.underline}** basic premises of
**[[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that have, since 1945,
**restrained nuclear weapon use**]{.underline} (Cimbala 2017).
[Deterrence depends on a dread faith by all parties that both their own
and their enemies' nuclear weapons will work]{.underline}. **[[The
possibility that nuclear weapons systems might be secretly
\[stopped]{.mark}\]]{.underline}** ~~disabled~~ [[raises prospects both
of overconfidence]{.underline}]{.mark} (trusting one can sabotage an
opponent's system) [[or panicked preemption]{.underline}]{.mark}
([[fearing]{.underline}]{.mark} left-of-launch [attacks on one's own
nukes and **falling into a "[use 'em or lose 'em"
mind-set]{.mark}**]{.underline}). More generally, **[[control and
command]{.underline}]{.mark}** of nuclear weapons [[depend on
communication systems **whose collapse in a crisis situation could have
catastrophic results**]{.underline}]{.mark}.8 The origin of the internet
lay in the U.S. attempt to ensure continuance of such systems in the
event of nuclear war; now the weaponization of the internet itself
constitutes a possible cause of nuclear war.

**No impact to warming**

**Jayaraj 21** \-\-- Vijay Jayaraj, M.Sc., Environmental Science,
University of East Anglia, England, Research Contributor for the
Cornwall Alliance for the Stewardship of Creation., "Why I Am a Climate
Realist", Cornwall Alliance, March 11^th^ 2021,
https://cornwallalliance.org/2021/03/why-i-am-a-climate-realist/

The answer to my question trickled in slowly over a number of years.
[Evidence began to emerge that [scientists acknowledged]{.mark} [a large
gap between]{.mark}]{.underline} the actual [[observed]{.mark}
real-world temperature [datasets]{.mark}]{.underline} (from satellites)
[[and]{.mark} those temperature [predictions from]{.mark} computer
climate [models]{.mark}]{.underline}.

While these differences may not prove the allegations against the
Climategate scientists, they do confirm one thing: the computer climate
models exaggerate the future warming rate due to their high sensitivity
to carbon dioxide emissions. As a result, the models continue to show an
excessive and unreal warming rate for future decades.

[Despite plenty of evidence, [the IPCC continues to use]{.mark} [these
**faulty** model predictions]{.mark}]{.underline} to inform the public
and policymakers about future changes in temperature.

**[A steady stream of [scientific studies]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[has
documented]{.mark} [the evidence for **lack of dangerous
warming**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[IPCC's level of warming based on
fifth- and sixth-generation]{.underline} (CMIP5 and CMIP6) [models and
the apparent absence of climate-induced ecological
collapse.]{.underline}

[[In 2020 alone, **over 400 peer-reviewed scientific papers**]{.mark}
**[took up a skeptical position on]{.mark} climate
[alarmism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [These papers---]{.underline}and
hundreds from previous years---[address various issues related to
climate change, including problems with]{.underline} climate change
[observation]{.underline}, climate [reconstructions, lack
of]{.underline} anthropogenic/CO2 [signal in sea-level rise, natural
mechanisms]{.underline} that drive climate change ([solar
influence]{.underline} on climate, ocean circulations, cloud climate
influence, ice sheet melting in high geothermal heat flux areas),
[hydrological trends that do not follow modeled
expectations]{.underline}, the fact that corals thrive in warm, high-CO2
environments, elevated CO2 and higher crop yields, no increasing trends
in intense hurricanes and drought frequency, the myth of mass
extinctions due to global cooling, [etc]{.underline}.

[[Academia is **filled** with scientific literature that contradicts the
position]{.mark} of those who believe [climate change is
unprecedented.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Also, during the course of the last decade, it became apparent that most
of Al Gore's claims in his 2006 documentary were false. Contrary to his
claims, polar bear populations remained steady, the Arctic did not
become ice free during the summer of 2014, and storms did not get
stronger due to global warming.

In simple words, Gore misled the world and promoted falsehood as
science, and he continues to do so while profiting from a renewable
industry that is sold as the cure for global warming. Yet, he himself
generates carbon dioxide emissions many times higher than an average
family's.

So, [[not only are]{.mark} the predictions of [models wrong, but]{.mark}
also the interpretations of climate data and the propaganda of a
[climate doomsday were also wrong.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Today, [we know the [modern warming rate is **not
unprecedented**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Warming of such
magnitude]{.underline}]{.mark} [has [happened twice within]{.mark} the
past [2000 years]{.mark}]{.underline}. Further, [ice at both poles is at
**historic highs**]{.underline}, even compared with the Little Ice Age
of the 17th century.

Besides, [there has been no increase in extreme weather]{.underline}
events due to climate change and the loss of lives due to environmental
disasters has drastically reduced during the last 100 years.

So, [I am a climate realist. I acknowledge that there has been a gradual
increase]{.underline} in global average temperature since the end of the
Little Ice Age in the 17th century. [I acknowledge that climate change
can happen]{.underline} in both ways---warming and cooling. [I do
understand that anthropogenic CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gases
could have positively contributed to the warming]{.underline} from
mid-20th century onwards.

I also acknowledge that warming and the increased atmospheric carbon
dioxide that has contributed to it have actually helped society. The
current atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, nearly 50 percent
higher than in the 17th century, and the warming---which has occurred
chiefly in winter, in higher latitudes and altitudes, and at night, thus
raising cold temperatures but with little effect on hot
temperatures---have actually resulted in optimal conditions for global
plant growth, thus aiding in the flourishing of the agricultural sector.

The Bengal tiger populations have bounced back, and polar bear
populations are steady, thanks to conservation efforts. Forest area in
Europe is increasing every year, and countries are planting tree
saplings at a record rate. Life expectancy has reached all-time highs in
many countries, and more people are constantly pulled out of extreme
poverty every year (although business lockdowns to fight COVID-19
threaten to reverse that trend). Access to freshwater has improved and
human productivity has increased drastically.

So, [**[there is no actual climate emergency]{.mark}.** Instead, what we
have are]{.underline} celebrities, activists, un-elected [political
bodies]{.underline} like the UN, and even some climate scientists
[religiously promoting a popular doomsday belief.]{.underline}

**[[The models]{.mark} do not know the future]{.underline}**, and
neither do the Climategate scientists. [But an [exaggerated view of
future]{.mark} warming provides the ideal background for
anti-carbon-based fuels policies that [will undermine]{.mark} the
[economic well-being]{.mark} of every society]{.underline} in the world.
We must not allow that.

[Be a climate realist.]{.underline}

#### Warming can't be solved for centuries -- impact inevitable

**IPCC 21** (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change -- Report
compiled by nearly 100 scientists and authors and trusted worldwide as a
leading source on climate change, "Climate Change 2021", IPCC, 9 August
2021,
<https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Full_Report.pdf>,
MG)

If the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere starts to go down, the
Earth's climate would respond to this 31 change (FAQ 5.3, Figure 1).
[Some parts of the climate system take time to react to a change in CO2
32 concentration, so [a decline in]{.mark} atmospheric [CO2]{.mark} as a
result of net negative emissions [would not lead to]{.mark} 33 immediate
[reversal of all climate change trends]{.mark}. Recent studies have
shown that global surface [temperature]{.mark} 34 starts to
[decline]{.mark} within a few years following a decline in atmospheric
CO2, although the decline would not 35 be detectable for
[decades]{.mark} due to natural climate variability (see FAQ 4.2). Other
consequences of human36 induced climate change such as reduction in
permafrost area would take decades, and yet others such as 37 warming,
[acidification and oxygen loss]{.mark} of the deep ocean [would take
centuries to reverse]{.mark} following a decline 38 in the atmospheric
CO2 concentration. [Sea level would continue to rise for many centuries
to millennia]{.mark}, even 39 if large deliberate CO2 removals were
successfully implemented.]{.underline}

## Framework

### 2AC\-\--C/I

#### Debate should situate itself [within]{.underline} the paradox of acceleration, [actively resisting]{.underline} the resentful impulse for [complete stability]{.underline}- we [accept]{.underline} the innate tension between humanity's [desire for security]{.underline} and the [dynamic nature]{.underline} of the world

**Glezos 14** (Simon Glezos, Ph. D. in political theory and
international relations from the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,
5-22-2014, Sagepub Journals, \"Brown's Paradox: Speed, ressentiment and
global politics\",
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1755088214533042)//guyB>

[We must therefore begin to cultivate a third way, **a response which
does not so much try to resolve Brown's Paradox, as
re-inflect**.]{.underline} Such an approach would seek to **[embrace the
power and opportunities which an accelerating world
provides]{.underline}**, [using them to resist the exploitation and
violence inherent in the contemporary world.]{.underline} However, at
the same time as it sought some amount of security for individuals, [it
would be willing to accept that a certain amount of contingency and
instability in the world is ineradicable]{.underline}. It would
[**ensure that this desire for stability did not manifest as a
reactionary drive for the exclusion and erasure of difference**, nor
through a totalitarian drive for complete mastery over
contingency]{.underline}. It would thus be [a politics that attempted to
express itself as]{.underline}, in Nietzsche's words, [an "active
force]{.underline}," which is to say [a force which expresses itself,
which builds a world to its specifications, but does so with an
understanding, and even affirmation, of the limitations of life in "this
world]{.underline}." Such a politics therefore would [rigorously have to
root out the sense of ressentiment against speed]{.underline}, and
[become comfortable with living, organizing, and taking action, in an
accelerating world of becoming]{.underline}. Learning to live within a
paradox (without resorting to tactics of violence or transcendence to
overcome or resolve the paradox) is no easy thing. In recent years, many
thinkers have tried to develop strategies for how to live within the
confines of paradoxes which they considered to be constitutive of
political life. William Connolly (1991), for example, repeatedly engages
with the question of what he terms "the paradox of identity," the
tension between the fact that we must simultaneously "accept the
indispensability of identity and live within the medium of identity
while refusing (while struggling vigorously to refuse) to live \[our\]
own identity as intrinsic truth" (p. 46). Chantal Mouffe (2005)
struggles with what she terms "the democratic paradox," the tension
between democracy as that which expresses the will of the people and
that which protects and expresses the rights and agencies of the
individual (pp. 2--3). Although each of these paradoxes relate to
specific topics, [they are fundamentally linked to the issues I raise,
insofar as all are about **the tension between the human desire for
stability and certainty**]{.underline} (stable identities, stable
communities, stable borders), **[and the recognition that individual
flows will always disrupt those certainties]{.underline}** (and the
further recognition that suppressing those flows entirely would require
escalating, and ultimately infinite, violence). All [are thus about the
tension between being and becoming. We can therefore look to the way
these other thinkers seek to deal with paradox. In both cases, these two
thinkers advocate **the importance of recognizing the ineradicability of
paradox**]{.underline}. Mouffe (2005) says that ["it is vital for a
pluralist democratic politics to expose and acknowledge
paradoxes]{.underline}" (p. 16), and Connolly (1991) argues that [we
must learn to think "within the code of paradox]{.underline}" (p. 60).
Note that [this recognition of paradox, this attempt to live within
paradox, **does not involve a complete letting go or rejection of our
desires of stability**. To do so would be to succumb to the temptation
to will away the paradox (as in the neoliberal approach)]{.underline}.
Connolly recognizes the inescapable dimension of identity, Mouffe
accepts (and lauds) the importance of a sense of community, and I
understand the importance of some sense of stability to the lives of
individuals and communities. However, [living within the paradox also
means acknowledging that these certainties will always be marked by an
inescapable degree of contingency]{.underline}. This [**does not mean
letting go of our desire for stability, but it does mean loosening our
attachment to it**, recognizing the necessity (and indeed desirability)
of some amount of difference, individuality, and flux in the world. This
loosening of attachment is not easy, and **cannot simply be the result
of policy prescription**. It will also mean **challenging dominant
narratives of identity, and working on the affective sensibilities of
individuals and communities to make them more capable of coping with a
certain amount of uncertainty and instability in the world**. A second
trajectory of future research on speed will therefore have to focus on
**how to draw on narrative and affective resources to inculcate a sense
of comfort with uncertainty**, and fight against the pull of
ressentiment]{.underline}. 16 In an ideal world, [this project of
**loosening people's attachments to stability** would begin to integrate
with the project of **making them less subject to the violence of global
acceleration,** creating a self-reinforcing cycle]{.underline}.17 As
people become more secure, [they become **less subject to
ressentiment-laden tendencies**]{.underline}. At the same time, [as they
affectively fight off the ressentiment-driven desire for stability,
**they potentially become more willing to engage in active political
tactics which might actually provide for greater security and
stability**]{.underline}. Lessened ressentiment against speed might
[provide the conditions of possibility for greater solidarity and
alliance building across borders and differences, a greater willingness
to take advantage of some of the powers which global acceleration
provides]{.underline}. Here we might look to [increasing examples of
global solidarity networks (Castells, 2012; Glezos, 2012: ch. 5) and to
transnational labor activism (Stillerman, 2003). Let us be clear; this
possibility of a feedback loop associated with living within paradox
should not be taken as a resolution of that paradox.]{.underline} We
must remember that this paradox is fundamentally irresolvable, and thus
that it will be the source of an ongoing political struggle over crucial
questions ("How much stability is enough?"; "How much velocity is
desirable?"). [This struggle will always run the risk of falling into
either ressentiment against speed or indifference to the pain that it
causes. This is as it should be.]{.underline} As Mouffe (2005) puts it,
when it comes to paradox ["\[N**\]o final resolution or equilibrium
between those two conflicting logics is ever possible**, and there can
be only temporary, pragmatic, unstable and precarious negotiations of
the tension between them" (p. 45). The best that we can do is try to
ensure that we live that paradox deliberately]{.underline}

### 2AC\-\--Borders DA

#### [Borders DA]{.underline}- their framework arguments mimic reactionary anxieties over globalization- in the face of debate's [progress]{.underline} and [acceleration]{.underline} they invoke the [spectre of chaos]{.underline} as a justification for exclusion

**Glezos 14** (Simon Glezos, Ph. D. in political theory and
international relations from the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,
5-22-2014, Sagepub Journals, \"Brown's Paradox: Speed, ressentiment and
global politics\",
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1755088214533042)//guyB>

- Cites the MV Sun Sea, a ship containing refugees

- Canadian citizens and the conservative government mischaracterized
  them as terrorists and human traffickers

- Glezos' example of the second of two reactions to Brown's paradox (the
  phenomenon about how as *the world* accelerates, humans become less
  politically motivated)

  - The first is a positive sidestepping of the paradox; neoliberalism
    convinces people that the lack of political motivation is a
    testament to the *success* of technological progress

    - Glezos concludes that this is an incorrect resolution to the
      paradox; the lack of political motivation in contemporary society
      *[cannot]{.underline}* be a result of stability and
      comfortability, because there are large demographics of people
      that exhibit political impotency while not living comfortably

    - "Thus, even when if you do not find yourself as one of the
      "losers" of the neoliberal economy---even if you manage to
      leverage your "wealth-producing assets" and take ownership over
      your own human capital---success is never secure, never stable.
      So-called progress inculcates a sense of anxiety and instability
      as to how long the "good times" will last (which makes one wonder
      exactly how "good" those times really are)."

  - The second is a more reactionary response- this is what we attempt
    to characterize framework as (even though the analogy isn't really
    1:1 imo)

    - It is about the invocation of sovereignty and authority in the
      face of acceleration

    - Because the world is seemingly so unstable, there is a trend
      towards strong figures able to give stability

    - This impulse to security leads states to build walls and cement a
      homogenous body politic

- This card is j the first part of the article, I think a better card
  will probably be below and have more application to
  discursive/academic spaces like debate

[One particularly common reactionary tactic intended to suppress the
acceleration of global flows is the dramatic rise in **the building of
fences and walls** by states,]{.underline} a phenomenon Brown engages
with in her recent book, Walled States, Waning Sovereignty. Brown (2010)
argues that [the proliferation of wall-building tactics is the **result
of states attempt to prop up their "waning sovereignty" against a world
of accelerating global flows**]{.underline} (p. 81). Though this occurs
in a multitude of different states and societies (including, among
others, the United States, Israel, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Saudi Arabia,
Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Botswana, Egypt, Brunei, China, Morocco, and
Brazil), in reaction to a variety of different particular local
contexts, [Brown (2010) identifies a common thread in the practice,
noting that **"\[t\]he popular desire for walling harbors a wish for the
power of protection, containment and integration promised by
sovereignty**]{.underline}" (pp. 8--19, 26). [Brown **identifies the
flurry of contemporary fence building as a response to the global
acceleration and flux**, lauded---and induced---by
neoliberalism]{.underline}. As she nicely puts it, "[Visible walls
respond to the need for containment in too global a world, too
unhorizoned a universe]{.underline}" (Brown, 2010: 119). [This
production of **walls constitutes only the most visible manifestations
of the proliferation of reactionary movements** and tactics attempting
to suppress difference, uncertainty, and flux (the three being
necessarily linked in an accelerating, globalizing world)]{.underline}.
In more general terms, [Chantal Mouffe (2005) describes how, in the
European context, **the "growth of various religious, moral and ethnic
fundamentalism" can be linked to the acceleration of globalization** and
neoliberalism's **"\[e\]xtreme forms of individualism**]{.underline}"
discussed above (p. 96). And a wide variety of thinkers have shown how,
[in diverse countries, anxiety over acceleration and uncertainty have
given rise to new reactionary political movements]{.underline}.6 It is,
of course, potentially dangerous to subsume all of these diverse
movements and activities under the same rubric. Unquestionably, specific
political activities will be rooted in specific historical contexts,
respond to specific local grievances, and draw on specific local
narratives (and what is more, of course, reactionary, conservative,
antidemocratic and fundamentalist political movements predate the
current era of acceleration). At the same time, [I believe that there is
something useful about linking these diverse political activities,
recognizing the way in which they are all at least partially responding
to a similar set of **anxieties over acceleration**]{.underline}. As
Brown (2010) points out in defense of her linking together acts of wall
building in wildly diverse political contexts, [despite "their
distinctive political and economic contexts, varied histories, various
states purposes and effects]{.underline} ... \[[E\]ach of the new walls
can be seen to issue from certain pressures on nations and states
**exerted by the process of globalization**]{.underline}" (p. 27).7 I
would argue that [the same can be said about the broader world of
reactionary politics, and about the phenomenon of "ressentiment against
speed"]{.underline} which I discuss below. To provide an example of the
kind of reactionary political stances I'm discussing, and to foreground
how they can be linked to questions of speed and acceleration, I now
wish to turn to a specific case study, that of the MV Sun Sea, a refugee
ship which arrived on the shores of Canada, sparking a wave of
anti-immigrant sentiments by both the Canadian government and populace.
I believe that [a close investigation of this case shows how, in
addition to a general xenophobia and racism, this response has to be
understood as tied to a more general anxiety over globalization and
acceleration]{.underline}. Furthermore, close investigation of this case
study will be helpful in articulating the central concept of
"ressentiment against speed." The choice of case study is very careful,
as the refugee frequently manifests as the abject representative of
accelerating globalization (see Nyers, 2003). As Brown (2010) puts it,
"almost nothing rivals the image of immigrant hordes as an incitement to
xenophobic nationalism and to demands for fierce state protectionism
amid globalization" (pp. 68--69). The MV Sun Sea In August 2010, [the MV
Sun Sea, a ship carrying 497 Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka]{.underline}
(fleeing the violent reprisals which Tamil populations have been subject
to in the wake of the civil war (UNHCR, 2010[)), was captured and
boarded by the Canadian Navy]{.underline} off the coast of Vancouver
Island. The [refugees were immediately detained]{.underline}. Most have
now been released, and the courts are deciding whether to grant them
permanent refugee status. The initial response in Canada was, however,
disturbing to say the least. Almost immediately upon news of the Sun Sea
hitting the media, [Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the ruling
Conservative party began to fan the flames of fear. Canadian daily The
Globe and Mail reported that "\[t\]he Harper government said
intelligence sources give it reason to believe the passengers include
human traffickers and people linked to the Tamil Tigers terrorist
group]{.underline}" (Chase et al., 2010), this despite having little to
no knowledge of who was actually on the boat (suspicions are that the
intelligence source to whom Harper was referring was the Sri Lankan
government itself). Public Safety Minister Vic Toews claimed that the
Sun Sea was a "test case," saying, "\[T\]his particular situation is
being observed by others who may have similar intentions and I think
it's very important that Canada deals with the situation in a clear and
decisive way" (Chase et al., 2010). All the while, Harper ominously
intoned, "[We are responsible for the security of our
borders]{.underline}" (Lablanc, 2010). All of this [served to
effectively **frame the case** of the Tamil refugees not in terms of
human rights or social justice, but **as a question of
security**]{.underline}. With the specter of terrorists being smuggled
into the country, and with hordes more apparently just over the horizon,
[a disturbing portion of Canadians embraced the government's
fear-mongering]{.underline}. In an Angus Reid poll "Fifty per cent of
poll respondents want\[ed\] to deport the passengers and crew of the
Tamil ship back to Sri Lanka, even if their refugee claims are
legitimate" (Taber, 2010, author's emphasis). More broadly, "[46 per
cent of Canadians believe immigration is having a negative effect on the
country]{.underline}, a five-point increase from \[one year previous\]"
(Taber, 2010). Now[, we might wish to dismiss this as a momentary
xenophobic panic, whipped up in a fairly obvious bit of voter
manipulation by desperate politicians]{.underline}. The Conservative
party was, at the time, a minority government, having failed to win a
majority in the previous two elections, and saw their poll numbers
falling. We could therefore potentially write it off as a brief moment
of cynical politicking by a right-wing party seeking to gin up
controversy. Unfortunately, [there is a long history of this kind of
panicked response to migrants and refugees in Canada]{.underline},
happening in almost unnervingly similar ways, in seemingly regular
cycles. [Just a little over 10 years ago, there was another public
outcry over immigration, this time caused by the arrival of several
boats of Chinese migrants, again off the coast of Vancouver Island.
Their arrival again prompted sizable protests and numerous denunciations
in the press]{.underline}.8 These recurring uproars have to be put in
the context of Canada's overall immigration situation. Canada has one of
the highest per capita immigration rates in the world---a rate which is
rising. According to projections from Statistics Canada, by 2031 the
Canadian population will be between 25% and 28% foreign born.
Additionally, according to the report "nearly one-half (46%) of
Canadians aged 15 and over would be foreign-born, or would have at least
one foreign-born parent" (Statistics Canada, 2010). As a result,
[between 29% and 32% of the Canadian population would be visible
minorities]{.underline}, the first- and second-largest groups among
which would be those of Chinese and South Asian descent. [Here we see
what Hartmut Rosa (2003) identifies as one of the key elements of the
social acceleration of time**, the perception of a radical increase in
the rate of "social change and transformation**]{.underline}" (p. 7).
This perception [gives rise to a profound anxiety over an accelerating
world. The **perception** of the **loss of impermeable borders** leaves
people feeling adrift in a world of **accelerating global
flows**.]{.underline} In such a context, [there is **a tendency to seek
out authoritative narratives**, ones which will hopefully **reaffirm
traditional borders** and **boundaries, securing** both **space** and
**identity**]{.underline}. As Brown (2010) describes it, [a world of
accelerating global flows "threatens an imaginary of individual and
national identity **dependent upon perceivable horizons and the
containment they offer**]{.underline}" (p. 26). Thus, recently, the
Conservative government has proposed a draconian overhaul of refugee and
immigration policy in parliament (Baluja, 2012). [Such reactionary
movements **must be understood in the context of global acceleration**,
and **the desire to resist Brown's Paradox through authoritative
re-imposition of political authority**, even if only against the weakest
and most vulnerable instantiations of this broad process]{.underline}.9
The story of the MV Sun Sea could be repeated ad nauseam, both within
Canada, and around the world. [Anti-immigration movements, xenophobic
panics, and the scapegoating of migrants have become the norm. There
are, of course, countless specific reasons that these movements pop
up---particular histories of racism, nationalism, colonialism;
particular economic, cultural, political, social, and personal
assemblages which allow these movements to gain ground. But at least one
of the factors driving these reactionary movements is **an increasing
anxiety over acceleration**, and a sense of insecurity that comes with
the seeming dissolution of borders which provided stability for
narratives of identity, morality, community, and so forth]{.underline}.
As Brown (2010) puts it, in the current political context, ["xenophobia
is ... overdetermined by the economic and political insecurities
generated by globalization"]{.underline} (p. 69). What is more,
anti-immigration movements are not the only manifestation of this fear
and anxiety over acceleration. [Everywhere in contemporary political
culture, we see reactionary calls for "**security**" and "**stability"
in the face of acceleration**]{.underline}. This frequently [manifests
itself as a move away from democratic deliberation and toward
centralized authoritarian power]{.underline}. We have seen this in the
rightward turn in Canadian politics over the last decade.10

### 2AC\-\--Revenge DA

#### [Revenge DA]{.underline}: their framework standards [scapegoat]{.underline} critical debate and leave the door open for authoritative figures to assert themselves- our attempts at engagement will [never be enough]{.underline} which culminates in hateful exclusion [within debate]{.underline}

**Glezos 14** (Simon Glezos, Ph. D. in political theory and
international relations from the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,
5-22-2014, Sagepub Journals, \"Brown's Paradox: Speed, ressentiment and
global politics\",)//guyB \*\* edited for gendered language

- Explains ressentiment as a "reactive power" which "separate\[s\]
  active force from what it can do"

  - This probably internal link turns their political engagement offense

- Positive change will never be enough because those plagued with
  ressentiment feel a generalized hatred of the world instead of
  particular scenarios

  - Maybe characterize the invocation of fairness as an a priori issue
    an example of shifting goalposts

  - "But these moralizing expressions... at least for a while longer" is
    a good part for this

[This is the greatest danger of ressentiment]{.underline} from a
Nietzschean perspective. [Unlike that active power which a sense of
resentment can potentially inculcate, **ressentiment functions as a
reactive power**.]{.underline} [Deleuze]{.underline} (2002), in his
analysis of Nietzsche, [develops an important insight when he says that
reactive powers are those which "decompose, **they separate active force
from what it can do**; they take away a part or almost all of its
power]{.underline}" (p. 57). [By orienting us toward idealized
spaces/times, and **rejecting intervention** in "this world,"
**ressentiment thus separates us from our power**, from what we can
do.]{.underline} [This is the crucial point which brings us back to
Brown's Paradox, with its description of a state of affairs where we
seem to have so much power at our fingertips, and yet seem able to do so
little with it]{.underline}. Note the fact that [ressentiment separating
us from what we can do does not mean that we stop doing
things]{.underline}. Indeed, [quite the opposite. When under the sway of
ressentiment we are just as prone to take action in the
world]{.underline}. This is because [in ressentiment **we have judged
the world and found it wanting**. We find this world of becoming and
speed to be a world of evil and suffering. This is why ressentiment also
manifests as a spirit of revenge]{.underline}. [We feel that the world
has punished us and **we wish to punish it back**, and this frequently
means seeking to punish those who are viewed as agents or avatars of
that evil]{.underline}. Once again, this is different than the active
behavior that might be undertaken in response to resentment. [There the
idea is to stop those who injure us, or overcome those things or people
who block our way]{.underline}. It is never just the reactive desire for
revenge, but always the active desire to achieve some goal, to further
our plans, to assert our values. [**The reactive movement of
ressentiment manifests as revenge**. It is thus premised upon a moral
judgment, and **is itself a moralizing move**]{.underline} (i.e. [one
acts primarily to punish an evil rather than achieve an
end]{.underline}). Indeed, it is this ability to [moralize suffering, to
assign blame that is so useful to the agent of
ressentiment]{.underline}. Nietzsche (1997) explains the difference
between resentment and ressentiment quite well in the passage below: In
my judgement, [we find here the actual physiological causation of
ressentiment, revenge and their ilk, in **a yearning**, then, **to
anaesthetize pain through emotion**]{.underline}:---[people generally
look for the same thing, wrongly in my view, in the defensive return of
a blow, a purely protective reaction**, a "reflex movement"** in the
case of any sudden injury or peril, such as that performed even by a
headless frog to ward off corrosive acid]{.underline}. But [the
difference is fundamental: in the one case the attempt is made to
prevent harm being done, in the other case, the attempt is made to
anaethetize a tormenting, secret pain that is becoming unbearable with a
more violent emotion of any sort, and at least rid the consciousness of
it for a moment]{.underline}---[for this, one needs an emotion, the
wildest possible emotion and, in order to arouse it, the first available
pretext]{.underline}. "[**Someone or other must be to blame that I feel
ill**."]{.underline} (p. 93) This [desire to seek out somebody to blame
is the pattern we see time and again in the reactionary politics of
ressentiment]{.underline}. It is what we saw above in the case of the MV
Sun Sea, and in other anti-immigration movements like it: [the attempt
**to identify and blame particular actors as representative of what are
broader movements and social forces**, to take the individual migrant as
a synecdoche of global acceleration as a whole]{.underline}. To return
to Wendy Brown's (2001) analysis: If, as Nietzsche recognized, impotent
rage inevitably yields a moralizing (re)action, how might we succeed in
rereading contemporary political life through this recognition? Might it
help us understand, for example[, the contemporary tendency to personify
oppression in the figure individuals and to reify it in particular acts
and utterances, the tendency to render individuals and acts intensely
culpable---indeed prosecutable---for history and for social
relations?]{.underline} (pp. 21--22) And what is more, [**we tend to
personify that oppression in the weakest**, most vulnerable
constituencies, themselves caught up in the same history and social
relations as their attackers]{.underline}. This is because, having
separated active force from what it can do, [the politics of
ressentiment naturally takes as its enemies those who are weakest, those
who are most easily targeted and punished]{.underline}. In relation to
these nationalist and xenophobic movements, it is instructive that, for
Nietzsche (1997), one of the most important contemporaneous examples of
the politics of ressentiment was the anti-Semite (p. 48). But [these
moralizing expressions of revenge and punishment, and the feeling of
power which comes along with them, does not actually lead to the
empowerment of the bearer of ressentiment]{.underline}. This is because
**[the standards that it sets can never be achieved]{.underline}**. A
mindset overcome by ressentiment [says that only a world free of
suffering, of uncertainty, of insecurity, is of any value]{.underline}.
[One does not want less pain, but no pain]{.underline}. **[Not less
insecurity, but no insecurity]{.underline}**. Thus, [no matter what is
done, **it will always fall short** of this goalpost]{.underline}.
[Actual **positive change**]{.underline} which might improve their lot,
or increase their power, [is eschewed because it **will never provide
them with ideal world they crave**]{.underline}. [Better to engage in
moralizing punishment which does nothing to solve their
pain,]{.underline} but, as Nietzsche says, [**at least anesthetizes
them** somewhat, **gives them a feeling of moral superiority** which
will keep them going, at least for a while longer]{.underline}.13 What
is more, [this **craving---for certainty, for stability**, and most
importantly, for **moral superiority**---makes these sufferers of
ressentiment **easy prey for those who wish to exploit them and gain
their support**]{.underline}. Nietzsche discussed this in terms of "the
Priests," but in our days, in democratic countries (and not just
democratic countries), [it is more useful to speak of the politician of
ressentiment, **the politician who does not just respond to the anxiety
and fear of ~~his or her~~ \[their\] public, but actively cultivates**
it]{.underline}. As Nietzsche (1997) describes it, He brings ointments
and balms with him, of course; but first he has to wound so that he can
be the doctor' and whilst he soothes the pain caused by the wound, he
poisons the wound at the same time---for that is what he is best trained
to do, this magician and tamer of beasts of prey, whose mere presence
necessarily makes everything healthy, sick, and everything sick, tame.
(p. 93) [The politician of ressentiment provides ever more targets and
scapegoats for moralizing punishment]{.underline}, knowing that it will
never actually solve the problems of ~~his or her~~ \[their\]
constituency (my god, if it did, what then?). Indeed, [it is not at all
coincidental that reactionary politicians of ressentiment frequently
institute neoliberal policies]{.underline}, [making the conditions of
insecurity and acceleration which give rise to the ressentiment against
speed even more prevalent. **The politician of ressentiment relies on,
and exploits**, ~~his or her~~ \[their\] constituency's **craving for
certainty** and stability, by presenting himself or herself as the
potential source of the authority that will usher in this other
world.]{.underline} The politicians of ressentiment [present themselves
to their constituency as "their support, defence, prop, compulsion,
disciplinarian, tyrant, God]{.underline}" (Nietzsche, 1997: 92).
**[People feel themselves incapable of bringing into being the world of
security they desire, and therefore become willing to submit to anyone
who claims that ability]{.underline}**. How else to explain The Globe
and Mail endorsement which simultaneously decries the "antidemocratic"
behavior of the Conservative party, while craving the "discipline,
leadership and bullheadedness" that they bring to government? In this
regard, [we see the final stage of ressentiment, and the final
ascendancy of "The Priests," of the politician of
ressentiment]{.underline}: "[**I suffer: someone or other must be
guilty**"---and every sick sheep thinks the same]{.underline}. But his
shepherd the ascetic priest, says to him, "[Quite right, my sheep!
Somebody must be to blame: but you yourself are this somebody, you
yourself alone are to blame for it, you yourself alone are to blame for
yourself]{.underline}." (Nietzsche, 1997: 94) When we authorize
increasingly centralized and authoritarian governments, when we do not
jealously guard our civil liberties and democratic rights, what are we
saying, other than that we accept that we are the problem with politics,
that we ourselves are to blame? [Give us, then, a "leader" who will
provide us with the security we crave]{.underline}.14 Once again,
[ressentiment as that which separates an active force from what it can
do, as that which separates people and communities from their
power.]{.underline} And [this is the irony of the ressentiment against
speed. **As people feel impotent in the face of acceleration, they
become more willing to give up what power they do have to increasingly
authoritarian structures** or, when they do express their power, do so
by attacking the weakest elements of the systems they oppose, usually in
ways which actually shore up the systems they are supposed to be
opposing.]{.underline}

### **2AC\-\--Improvement Bad**

#### The will to self-improve is a **smokescreen** for the move to a data-driven life -- that culminates in the violent transformation of subjectivity into the "thinglike"

**Kroker** and Kroker **21** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and
adjunct professor of political science at the University of Victoria,
Marilouise Kroker - feminist scholar, publisher, editor, writer,
theorist, and performance artist, "Technologies of the New Real",
University of Toronto Press, Pages 33-34, October 2021, MG)

[Palpable signs that we are already living in the midst of the
singularity are provided by the growing cultural appeal of what has been
described as the "quantified self movement." In this scenario,
bodies]{.underline} strap on their mobile prosthetics, digitally tattoo
themselves with an array of wearable electronic sensors, calibrate their
social media lives by complex, flexible forms of digital self-tracking
made possible by those new clouds of digital cumulus drifting across the
global sky, and [turn the previously unmeasured, untracked, and perhaps
even unnoticed into vibrant streams of shareable data. Essentially, the
surface of the body, as well as its previously private interiority, is
transformed into GPS data in the greater games of augmented reality.
Except, this time, data bodies are not so much using mobile phones to
scan graphics that open onto a previously invisible world of graffiti,
games, and advertising, but **envelop the body** in a big GIF (graphics
interchange format) of its very own -- a digital penumbra of numbers
about eating, sleeping, loving, and working that provides an electronic
shadow for tracking bodily activities. Suddenly, we find ourselves
living in an age of the body and its digital shadow; this complex cloud
of hyper-personalized data points is not just accumulated by mobile
bodies as they track their way through life but is always spinning away
from the body in fantastic reconfigurations of comparative databases
that may be perfect receptacles for social sharing but are also
measuring points for **better individual living**.]{.underline}

[Thought of in purely astronomical terms, the quantified self movement
is like a protostar  -- a dense concentration of "molecular clouds where
stars form."]{.underline}9 Here, the newly emergent data self quickly
throws off qualitative cultural debris from its past, [thus committing
itself to the daring gamble of seeking to quantify the
unquantifiable]{.underline}, to literally construct a DIY body, one
measurement at a time, that takes close account of lessons to be
learned, data to be shared, measurements to be undertaken, numbers to be
calculated, [**results to be reflected upon**, and **activities to be
improved**, upgraded, and overcome by its digital double -- life by
numbers.]{.underline} In any event, for a society in which complex
mergers between machine intelligence and human bodies are underway, [one
important adaptive response on the part of an always flexible human
species is to **transform subjectivity** in the direction of that which
is required for smooth admission to the end times of technological
singularity. If the language of power is data, if the language of
connection is convergence, and if the privileged value is speed, then
what could be better than a coherent, comprehensive, and creative plan
for reproducing a form of "self" that eerily mimics the etymological
meaning of data as "**thinglike**"? Refusing the intuitive, throwing off
the ineffable, and breaking forever with the imaginary, the quantified
self movement **reverses the traditional order of human subjectivity**
by making the thing-like character of quantifiable data both the
precondition and goal of individual identity in the age of nonbiological
intelligence.]{.underline} Unlike traditional Christian monasteries that
provided physical shelter in good times and bad for the idea of the
sacred and its associated religious institutions, the quantified self
movement promulgates, [in effect, a new order of digital monasticism
that puts down roots in the psychic dimension of human subjectivity
itself.]{.underline} With being data its primal act of faith, with the
meticulous, even obsessive, calculation of life's quanta -- be it
empathy, happiness, sex, or cardiovascular health -- as its social
practice, and with meetups of members of the quantified self movement as
its mode of confessional, [this new monastic order heralds the eclipse
of traditional expressions of human subjectivity and the triumphant
emergence of the thing-like -- the "**data-driven life**" as the form of
(technological) self now taking flight at the dawn of the
singularity.]{.underline}

But wait. If you were to attend one of the global quantified self
meetups -- and they are everywhere now -- the reality is most likely the
opposite. [The overall thematic might be the quantified life, but what
resonates is the sense of **individuals trying to find themselves**,
perhaps puzzled by the complications of daily life, and attempting as
best they can, one self-confession at a time, to put the whole thing
together for themselves by talking and sharing data. For example, each
participant has five to ten minutes to discuss three core predetermined
questions: "What did you do? How did you do it? What did you
learn?"]{.underline}10 It is as if network communications are not so
much about the cold indifference of relational data points but about its
actual content -- [that whole stubbornly individual, always vulnerable,
terribly anxiety-prone mass of highly individuated individuals. There is
definitely a general yearning for **self-improvement in the
air**,]{.underline} definitely a sense that the basic themes of Norman
Vincent Peale's The Power of Positive Thinking, with its homage to
projected self-confidence and adaptive behaviour, has escaped the power
of the written text and taken up an active alliance with proponents of
the quantified life. Or maybe it's something different. Perhaps talking
by data is the most recent manifestation of Dale Carnegie's How to Win
Friends and Influence People, with its insightful strategies for winning
other people over to your own way of doing things by first and foremost
winning yourself over to yourself.

### **2AC\-\--Scenario Analysis Bad**

#### The way we discuss the future matters -- analyzing hypothetical scenarios primes us for neurological modification

**Kroker** and Kroker **21** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and
adjunct professor of political science at the University of Victoria,
Marilouise Kroker - feminist scholar, publisher, editor, writer,
theorist, and performance artist, "Technologies of the New Real",
University of Toronto Press, Pages 41-43, October 2021, MG)

[Sound dystopian?]{.underline} It promises an unfolding technological
future powered up by optogenetics where, with neural implant devices yet
to be created, [the brain will be opened up to **radical psychic
surgery** by lightactuated technologies with the aim of **disappearing
lived memory**, substituting in its place artificial memories --
"sensory percepts" -- of a past that will probably be all the more
vivid, compelling, calming, soothing, and haunting precisely because it
never actually happened.]{.underline} However, in the usual way of
things technological, [if optogenetics as a dystopian gateway into
neural modification of the brain can sound so ready-made menacing, that
is probably because it is a latecomer to the **real-live games of
politics** in the age of neural modification by those other circulating
light-actuated screens of mass media. Here, producing false memory
syndrome, memories of events that are **all the more real** because they
**never actually occurred**, is the normal business of contemporary
media imaginaries. The skilful combination of spectacular televised
spectacles, mass suggestion, and mesmerizing rhetoric provide an instant
gateway into the politically effective **neurological modification** of
cerebral cortices living under the personal and collective stress of
impotent anger, unabated rage, and hysterical anxiety. For example,
consider the implantation of synthetic percepts in the form of false
memory syndrome so spectacularly performed on that always fabled day of
moral reckoning in American political consciousness]{.underline}, 4 July
2020, where, with memories of other Independence Days from Sherman's
military conquest of Atlanta to the Declaration of Independence itself,
[President Trump took to the symbolically hallowed, and deeply
colonized, ground of Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills of North Dakota
to rework American political memory with silence on the pandemic,
mockery of Black Lives Matter, and the declaration of a new civil war
based on warring racial relationships and featuring a beleaguered and
threatened population of vulnerable white Americans assaulted by
menacing]{.underline} [hordes]{.underline}  -- Black Lives Matter and
their allies in the streets as part of a resurgent "leftwing fascism" --
coming to steal American history, to obliterate cultural memory itself.
Everything was there: televised spectacle with the carved presidential
faces on Mount Rushmore in the background, a mass crowd as a real-life
stand-in for the hoped-for mass audience of American television viewers,
and [mesmerizing rhetoric of the war spirit based on equal mixtures of
panic fear and proud belligerence that was immediately circulated
everywhere through the media stream]{.underline}. This contemporary
inversion of the Sermon on the Mount, with its emphasis this time on the
war spirit not the love spirit, did not have to wait for future
breakthroughs in the neuroscience but deployed light-based technologies
ready at hand, the screen culture of television and social media, as its
very own neural implants for [communicating **new memories**  -- true
for some, false for others -- from the digital world to the only psychic
structure that really counts politically, the liquid, fluid brain matter
of American mass society, in order to accomplish the neurological
modification of the collective American cerebral cortex. That the neural
implant was successful could be immediately verified by those
**experimental demonstrations** in the streets: white jaguars being
driven into crowds of protesters and shootings of anti-racism protesters
by palpably anxious white men and women armed with guns locked and
loaded.]{.underline}

[In contemporary quantum culture, there are no necessary causal links,
only deeply entangled relationships among fast-moving particles moving
in the same web of space and time: positional, relative, and
connected.]{.underline} This vector of twisted memories, as its moves at
high velocity through the mediascape, sometimes takes the form of a
futurist announcement from DARPA concerning engineering neural implants
for fast communication between digital reality and the brain; at other
times, it's streamed in all its hauntingly prophetic vividness by the
cinematic imaginary and, then again, makes its presence felt affectively
as the basic code of contemporary political neurology. [Here,
neuroscience, futurist cinema, and political campaigning are themselves
different twists taken in this entangled story of twisted memory:
recombinant in its movements, bendable in time and space, and always
travelling at high velocity]{.underline}. Of course, as with all
important technological changes, neuroscientific research in
optogenetics remains at the periphery of human attention until, [once
fully realized, the consequential results are moved instantly from the
edges of human awareness to its very centre]{.underline}. Perhaps more
than is realized, optogenetics promises to be the capstone of
technology's relentless movement from the exterior of the body to its
deepest interiority, involving as it does the stated engineering aim of
providing a gateway into the cerebral cortex, [not only **changing
behaviour** but providing for the potential implanting of **new visual
memories**. Following the ideological formula that eases public
accommodation to radical technological change]{.underline}, optogenetics
was introduced in the language of facilitation, namely the promise of
facilitating medical breakthrough. Once successfully adopted, the real
implications of optogenetics as command language of the approaching age
of neural modification will be imposed: neural implants for remembering
a past that never existed, algorithms for mood modification,
three-dimensional light-based treatments for screening away the
differences. [The once and future migration of neuroscience from the
language of **facilitation** to **command** will itself be facilitated
by the fact that we are now preparing to **enter a future we have
already long visually inhabited** through the cinematic imaginary and
which, moreover, we have already experienced at a deep affective level
through the fabulations of twisted memory as the emotional alphabet of
contemporary politics.]{.underline}

### 2AC\-\--Framework Bad

#### Framework is equivalent to Robot Prison Guards -- monitoring debaters for outward psychic rebellions that break the norm and responding with rage, psychic violence, and exclusion

**Kroker** and Kroker **21** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and
adjunct professor of political science at the University of Victoria,
Marilouise Kroker - feminist scholar, publisher, editor, writer,
theorist, and performance artist, "Technologies of the New Real",
University of Toronto Press, Page 129, October 2021, MG)

Quickly migrating beyond the use of robots to physically guard
prisoners, this prototype project represents that moment when [robots
first began to evolve beyond their purely mechanical function as prison
guards to the more complex task of carrying out **psychiatric
assessments**]{.underline} of the behavioural patterns of prison
inmates. While it could be expected that robots would first enter
prisons in the traditional roles of surveillance and control, the three
robots involved in the demonstration project have a very different task:
namely, to mingle among a captive population as only a five-foot robot
can do and, while "looking more friendly to the inmates," conduct an
active search for signs of suicidal and violent behaviour. It's not so
much, then, a demonstration concerning the feasibility of using robots
in prison environments but actually an experiment with very general
applications for perfecting an operating system allowing robots to
conduct complex psychiatric examinations of prisoners. [At this point,
we move beyond cinematic images of prisons of the future with robotic
guards in towers carefully monitoring prison populations to that moment
when technology actively **penetrates the human psyche** in search of
"**risky behaviour**." Here, robots are no longer mechanical devices,
but artificial psychiatrists equipped with 3D vision, motion detection,
and programmed operating systems, all aimed at discerning visible signs
of melancholy, rage, despair, desperation, fatigue, and hopelessness.
While it is not evident from media reports how robots are to fulfil
complex psychiatric examinations -- other than the mention of the
demonstration robots monitoring abrupt changes in the behaviour of
individual prisoners -- the intention is clear: for prison guard robots
to cross the boundary between **surveillance from the outside of captive
bodies to internal explorations of psychic behaviour**. Guided by a
prescriptive doctrine concerning the parameters of "risky behaviour,"
what is really being tested here is robots as avatars of the new normal,
conducting frequent visual examinations of a chosen, and necessarily
captive, population in order to determine which bodies **fall inside and
outside of the normative intelligibility** determined by the
artificially defined ethics of "**risky behaviour**." In this case, it
is the responsibility of those bodies placed under surveillance to
provide no outward signs of either visible dissent (violence) or refusal
of the state's power over life (suicide).]{.underline}

While at first glance it might seem that guard robots are not programmed
with levels of artificial intelligence and, perhaps, artificial
affectivity necessary to detect otherwise invisible signs of powerful
emotions internal to the psychic life of prisoners, what may be brought
into political presence here is an entirely new conception concerning
how power will operate in the robotic future: [not so much the great
referentials of power over death, or even power over life, but power
over visible expressions of human affectivity -- a form of robotic
control that **assumes the psyche** is not a form of internal being but
a kind of external doing; that is, the psyche is not something we have
but something we do]{.underline}. In this scenario, what is important
about the human psyche for purposes of the society of control is less
the complexities of hidden intentions -- [the cultural acedia associated
with feelings of melancholy, **resentments that activate rage**, total
powerlessness that motivates despair -- than those visible, outward
manifestations of the rebellious psyche, that moment when the bodily
psyche moves from the long, silent gestation of hidden intentionality to
overt declarations of its intention to act, whether through violence
or]{.underline} suicide. At that point, at least according to this
prototype demonstration, [robot guards will be waiting along the
watchtower of the society of control, quickly targeting **immanent signs
of psychic rebellions** against the order of normative intelligibility,
relaying warnings to central command, all the while standing by for
further instructions.]{.underline}

### FW -- A2: Some things are calculable

#### Our argument isn't that *[nothing]{.underline}* is [contingently knowable]{.underline} -- it's that we will *[never]{.underline}* know *[everything]{.underline}* about the world works

**Glezos 20** (Simon Glezos, Ph. D. in political theory and
international relations from the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,
10-5-2020, Routledge, \"Speed and Micropolitics Bodies, Minds, and
Perceptions in an Accelerating World, pp 80\", )//guyB

[Turning to Spinoza as a way of helping to understand and combat the
rise of ressentiment against speed might appear to be a curious
decision]{.underline} as, at first blush, [it **seems as if Spinoza's
metaphysics are themselves an instance of ressentiment against
speed**]{.underline}. This is because [explicit in Spinoza's monistic
ontology is a complete rejection of contingency]{.underline}. Spinoza
[views all things as unfolding according to a strict conception of
necessity.]{.underline} As he says, '\[[n\]othing in nature is
contingent, but all things are from the necessity of the divine nature
determined to exist and to act in a definite way']{.underline} (I P29).
Everything that happens is fully determined according to the
requirements of being. [**Our perception of contingency is merely the
result of our inability to grasp the complete web of causality that
determines any action**, outcome, or decision]{.underline}. Indeed, [in
Spinoza's metaphysics, **even God is not capable of
contingency**]{.underline} saying, 'God does not act from freedom of
will' (I P32C1) but [rather from the necessity of his
nature]{.underline}. [Despite this rejection of ontological contingency,
Spinoza's work is actually surprisingly useful in helping us understand
how people react to contingency in an accelerating world]{.underline}.
This is because of the way in which his epistemology works alongside his
ontology. [For Spinoza, **humans are always constrained by our
finiteness**, and hence our understanding will always be premised upon
inadequate knowledge]{.underline}. As such, **[the perception of
contingency in life is ineradicable]{.underline}**. [It is true that,
through rational thought we are able, in a certain way, to **perceive
things sub specie aeternitatis**]{.underline}. But [this **only relates
to understanding the formal logical rules which govern
existence**]{.underline}. It [**does not lead us to be able to actively
grasp** (or predict) all of the web of **causal factors** which lead any
individual 'thing' to occur]{.underline} (II P16--17). (And all of this
before Spinoza's doctrine of parallelism, with its determinations and
limitations of thought, is brought into the mix.) From this perspective,
**[our perception of infinite being will always be
incomplete]{.underline}**, and [we **will always see the world as full
of contingency**]{.underline}. It [does not matter if metaphysically
there is no freedom or indeterminacy]{.underline} in deus cive natura.
[Our lives as modal beings will **always be replete with
uncertainty**]{.underline}, no matter how much we might learn about the
universe.

### FW -- A2: Ressentiment Good -- 2NC

#### [Ressentiment]{.underline} isn't [resentment]{.underline}- their impact turns aren't responsive

**Glezos 14** (Simon Glezos, Ph. D. in political theory and
international relations from the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,
5-22-2014, Sagepub Journals, \"Brown's Paradox: Speed, ressentiment and
global politics\",
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1755088214533042)//guyB>

- Just defines ressentiment and resentment, says they're different
  things

[**Ressentiment should not be confused with resentment.** Resentment, a
sense of anger over pain or injury we may have suffered (of whatever
sort), is a **natural response**, as is **the attempt to challenge or**
overturn the sources of these **pains or injuries**]{.underline}.12
**[Nietzsche]{.underline}** (1976) [**does not council a kind of ascetic
rejection of judgment**, simply accepting everything as it
comes]{.underline}---in which case, we would become, in his words, the
ass which can only bray "Yeah-yuh" (p. 424)---[nor is he arguing for a
Christian "turning of the other cheek]{.underline}." [**Being angry**,
resentful, unhappy, and so on are all perfectly **acceptable** to
Nietzsche so long as---]{.underline}and this is crucial[---**they serve
as a spur to action**. So long as your resentment or anger becomes a
vector for productive intervention in the world, then they have the
potential to be good or noble.]{.underline} [The trouble with
ressentiment is that, counter to resentment, it does not act as a spur
to productive action]{.underline} (although it does still frequently
spur reactive behavior, a distinction I will shortly explain). Quite the
contrary, [**ressentiment is resentment crystallized and
spiritualized**, and thus focuses not on any particular agent or actor,
but rather simply on the **world as a whole**. Ressentiment expresses
itself as **a generalized resentment against a world** that **allows
pain** and suffering to occur]{.underline}. It frequently manifests as
[a rejection of the world, and the imagining of a world of perfection in
opposition to this "imperfect" world]{.underline}. Nietzsche (1968a)
makes clear how [this drive to idealization is linked to ressentiment
and the spirit of revenge. "To talk about 'another' world than this is
quite pointless ... we revenge ourselves on life by means of the
phantasmagoria of '**another**,' a '**better' life**"]{.underline} (p.
49). [This link between idealization and revenge is displayed quite
strongly]{.underline}, Nietzsche (1968b) says, in many of the major
works of metaphysics in the Western canon: Psychology of
Metaphysics---[This world is apparent: consequently there is a true
world]{.underline};---[this world is conditional; consequently there is
an unconditioned world]{.underline};---[this world is full of
contradiction: consequently there is a world free of
contradiction;---this world is a world of becoming: consequently there
is a world of being:---all false conclusions ...]{.underline} [**It is
suffering that inspires these conclusions**: fundamentally they are
**desires that such a world should exist**]{.underline}**;** in the same
way, [to **imagine another**, more valuable **world** is an expression
of **hatred for a world that makes one suffer**: the ressentiment of
metaphysicians against actuality is here creative]{.underline}. (pp.
310--311) ["It is suffering that inspires these conclusions" and
ressentiment is "expression of hatred for a world that makes one
suffer."]{.underline} [This is the danger of ressentiment and how it
differs from resentment. **Resentment is a part of living in the world**
for Nietzsche, a world which produces suffering and which therefore must
be responded to. But **ressentiment takes one out of the world**. It
orients one's actions to other worlds, worlds which do not
exist.]{.underline}

This quote brings out another important element of Nietzsche's thinking.
[Looking at Nietzsche's critique of idealism**, we might begin to take
him for a kind of vulgar realist**, criticizing flights of philosophical
fancy.]{.underline} This is to [**misunderstand** the complexity of
**Nietzsche's conception of the world of becoming**]{.underline}.
[Nietzsche **never takes what the "world" is for granted**]{.underline}
and, with his focus on creativity, [even were "one" to know what the
"world" is, the world---and "one"---would almost certainly change
immediately]{.underline}. But [**that is exactly the point**. Nietzsche
affirms that **the world is a world of change**, of becoming, of
uncertainty, of contingency (and therefore necessarily of suffering and
disappointment). **This is the world that we live in, and the world in
which we must act.**]{.underline}

  critiqued that idea so ig it goes neg

- Isolates urgency as a generative point of Socrates hatred, very linked
  to acceleration

It is a brief reference, almost an aside, in a dialogue mostly devoted
to questions of morality. In Gorgias, Socrates engages in a dialogue
with three rhetoricians, criticizing the art of rhetoric, and debating
the nature of morality. However, in the middle of this discussion,
[Socrates makes the statement earlier as a way of **distinguishing
rhetoric** (and sophistry) **from philosophy**]{.underline}, arguing
that the latter is about expertise and truth, while [the former is
**about flattery**]{.underline}. Though only briefly mentioned, this
passage is crucial for Socrates' argument, since [it explains why
rhetoric can't ultimately be about truth]{.underline}. This is because
[the conditions of these kinds of discussions (public debate in the
agora) are such as to make real understanding impossible]{.underline}.
Bruno Latour, in his discussion of the Gorgias, notes that [these
conditions are threefold**: number, priority, and urgency**. Such
discussions happen in the context of **large groups of people, about
important issues, and, crucially, frequently must happen quickly**
(either because they are responding to fast-moving events, or because
the people involved do not have the time to devote to the kind of
in-depth discussion and study that would be necessary to produce genuine
expertise]{.underline}). According to Socrates, [these conditions make
'real' understanding impossible]{.underline}. However, as Latour points
out, [such an approach means that Socrates has, out of hand, **dismissed
the very possibility of democratic politics**]{.underline}. As Latour
says [Yes, there are too many of them, the questions are too important
\[megala pragmata\], there is too little time \[oligô
chrono]{.underline}\]. [**Are these not, however, the normal conditions
of the Body Politic**? Is it not to deal with these peculiar situations
of number, urgency, and priority that the subtle skills of politics were
invented]{.underline}? ( Latour 1999: 221) [**Socrates' vision of truth
as purely the domain of the expert** -- the philosopher -- working
slowly and assiduously outside of the agora, ultimately means a
rejection of the practice of democratic politics]{.underline}. Of
course, [Socrates (or rather Plato's) anti-democratic politics have been
extensively discussed.]{.underline} Most of this commentary focuses on
[Plato's]{.underline} elitism, his **[rejection of the demos for its
failure to possess the understanding of the true and the good necessary
to be able to govern themselves]{.underline}**. However, the reason I
bring this dialogue up is to note [the less frequently remarked upon
condition that makes Socrates opposed to democratic politics: **the
condition of urgency**]{.underline}. [Rhetoric fails not just because it
tries to get 'so many people' to understand, but because **it attempts
to do so in 'such a short time'**]{.underline}**.** [The danger of
politics is exactly that it must, at least sometimes, be done
quickly]{.underline}. And [this problem of urgency is, arguably, a
greater problem for Socrates than number or priority]{.underline}. While
the conditions of [number and priority can be resolved through the
abolition of democracy and the imposition of a philosopher
king]{.underline}, this [does not necessarily solve the problem of
urgency]{.underline}. While certainly [there are many thinkers that
argue that a **centralization of political authority** is the correct
response to the problem of urgency,2 this **does not free us from the
problem of urgency**, but, at best, provides **a new set of tools for
responding to it**]{.underline}. What this means is that [it is
potentially the condition of urgency that shifts Socrates' position from
antidemocratic politics, to simply anti-politics]{.underline}.
**[Socrates hatred of politics qua politics is, I would argue, at root a
hatred of speed]{.underline}**. [To commit to the practice of politics
is ultimately to accept that **there will be times in which one cannot
avail oneself of leisurely reflection and analysis before making
decisions and taking action**]{.underline}. As a result[, by the end of
the Gorgias Socrates has thoroughly rejected the politics and
debates]{.underline} of the agora, and shifted his argument to the court
of the afterlife, describing how the moral man will be judged righteous
in the world to come. But as Latour puts it '[Politics is not about
"freshly dead" people, but about the living; not about ghoulish stories
of the afterworld, but about gory stories of this world']{.underline}
(1999: 246). [Socrates escapes the world of becoming to the world of
being exactly because he cannot ultimately cope with the conditions of
politics he experiences within it]{.underline}. And it is, ultimately,
[the speed of the world of becoming that Socrates seeks to transcend;
its uncertainty, its changeability and accelerations]{.underline}.3 R.
B. J. Walker describes Plato as a man who 'seek\[s\] to flee
Introduction 3 from politics into the world of forms' and refuses to
'take seriously the world of fleeting impressions, of flux, becoming,
and illusions' (1993: 109). Crucially, as Latour points out, [**the
problem is not just that Socrates seeks to 'flee from politics', but
that in fleeing he seeks to also destroy the practices that make
politics possible**. To see a political project through, with the crowd,
for the crowd, in spite of the crowd, is so stunningly difficult that
Socrates flees from it]{.underline}. But [**instead of conceding defeat
and acknowledging the specificity of politics, he destroys the means of
practicing it**, in a sort of scorched earth-policy the blackened
wreckage of which is still visible today]{.underline}. ( 1999: 239)
Having identified the problems of number, priority, and urgency which
constrain the process of democratic decision making[, Socrates attacks
the practices of rhetoric]{.underline} (as well as several other allied
arts) by which the Athenian community had learned to grapple with these
constraints because they do not meet the standards of his rigorous,
slow-moving, didactic philosophical knowledge. Says Latour of this kind
of necessarily speedy democratic, political deliberation: Of course 'it
does not involve expertise,' of course 'it lacks rational
understanding'; the whole dealing with the whole under the incredibly
tough constraints of the agora must decide in the dark and will be led
by people as blind as themselves, without the benefit of proof, of
hindsight, of foresight, of repetitive experiment, of progressive
scaling up[. In politics there is never a second chance -- only one,
this occasion]{.underline}, this Kairos. [There is never any knowledge
of cause and consequence. Socrates has a good laugh at the ignorant
politicians, but there is no other way to do politics, and the invention
of an afterworld to solve the whole question is exactly what the
Sophists laugh at, and rightly so]{.underline}! Politics imposes this
simple and harsh condition of felicity: hic est Rhodus, hic est saltus.
( 1999: 242) In short, [what we get is a surprisingly common worldview.
Truth and understanding can only be developed slowly. **Politics
necessarily happens quickly.** Therefore, Politics cannot be about truth
and understanding. In turn, the **tactics and practices which are
developed to make a speedy politics possible must be devalued and
degraded. Socrates' fear and anxiety of speed translates into his hatred
of politics**]{.underline} (especially democratic politics[) and vice
versa.]{.underline}

#### The skills they get from engaging our aesthetic performance are key to politics in an accelerating world

**Glezos 20** (Simon Glezos, Ph. D. in political theory and
international relations from the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,

Perceptions in an Accelerating World, pp 9-10\", )//guyB

This [[rejection of rhetoric]{.underline}]{.mark} (and cookery) [because
they are [based on]{.mark} habit and [pleasure]{.mark}, and [not]{.mark}
on 'true [understanding']{.mark}, ultimately **means [doing away with
the tools]{.mark} that a [community]{.mark} might [use to deal]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} [fast]{.mark}-moving sphere of
[politics]{.mark}**]{.underline}. What is important here [is the way in
which the rejection of forms of practice which lack 'real understanding'
is [also]{.mark} frequently a [rejection of]{.mark} modes of
[thought]{.mark} and practice which are [rooted in the
body]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In rejecting flattery -- whether cookery or
rhetoric -- Socrates explicitly [rejects]{.mark} forms of practice **and
understanding rooted in the [affects]{.mark}** (pleasure), and in habit
(embodied forms of knowledge]{.underline}). Indeed, [Plato's account of
knowledge and morality ultimately ends up not just with a flight from
the world of becoming, but very explicitly with **a flight from the
body**,]{.underline} as he explains his vision of judgement in the
afterlife wherein 'the soul has been stripped of the body' (131, 524d).
Here we see the way in which [Socrates' **rejection of politics is [tied
to his rejection of speed]{.mark}**, and both are tied to his rejection
of the body]{.underline}. Socrates is, in the language of Nietzsche (to
which we will return in the fourth chapter), [a 'despiser of the
body']{.underline} (1976: 146). His rejection of the body also means
[the rejection of a variety of mechanisms that the Athenian body politic
uses to interrogate political and ethical questions, articulate beliefs,
and manage conflicts]{.underline}. As Latour says of the political tools
which Socrates jettisons: [About what do\[es Socrates\] talk so
irreverently]{.underline}? Cookery first, and then [the skills of the
greatest **[playwrights]{.mark}**, the greatest **[sculptors]{.mark}**,
the greatest **musicians**, the greatest **architects**, the greatest
**[orators]{.mark}**, the greatest **statesmen**, the greatest
**tragedians**]{.underline}. All of [**these people [are
dumped]{.mark}** because [they don't know what they know in the didactic
fashion that]{.mark} Professor [Socrates]{.mark} [wants to
impose]{.mark} on the people of Athens]{.underline}. ( Latour 1999: 244)
What Latour is here describing is [a society that manages the conditions
of politics -- number, priority, urgency -- by relying on a variety of
arts, occurring at a variety of tempos]{.underline}. [Whether it be
**tragedies** in which **political and moral issues are
dramatized**]{.underline} (Butler 2000) (Honig 2013), [**sung poems**
which communicated moral and political norms]{.underline} (Havelock
1963), [**public oration**s in which political questions are
debated]{.underline} ( Aristotle 1991), [public works of [art]{.mark}
and architecture which [create a public space to manage]{.mark} and
organize these political [debates]{.mark}]{.underline} ( Arendt 1998)
(Cuboniks 2018: 77), or even arts of cookery which underpin communal
experiences of eating (Panagia 2009: Ch. 5). Crucially [even as many of
these sites rely on conscious thought and reflection, **they also [fold
in affects, habits, memories, and corporeal qualities]{.mark}** which
[prepare and shape political sensibilities fo]{.mark}r the complex and
[speedy encounters of the agora]{.mark}]{.underline}. As we will discuss
in Chapters 2 and 3 [, **it is exactly the affect imbued character of
thought that allows it to respond effectively to a quickly unfolding
pace of events**]{.underline}. And in both our discussions of Spinoza
and Bergson, we will see accounts which, contra Socrates, seek to
valorize [the role of habit as a way of building both individuals and
societies which can respond effectively to a 'speedy' pace of life and
politics]{.underline}. [**Socrates' rejection of the tools of politics
is thus ultimately tied to his rejection of the body**, and both are
crucially **tied to his fear of speed**.]{.underline} One of the central
goals of this book will be to tease out the relations between speed,
politics, and the body, noting that [theoretical work on the body is
frequently helpful, and indeed necessary, in navigating the seeming
impasses that the problem of speed introduces into the practice of
politics]{.underline}. This focus on questions of bodily practice links
us to the last theme that this book will explore.

### AT: Predictability

#### Procedural constraints preclude authentic learning 

**Waghid 14** \[Pedagogy Out of Bounds: Untamed Variations of a
Democratic Future, Yusef Waghid, Stellenbosch University, Matieland,
South Africa, 2014, ebook, EDUCATIONAL FUTURES, RETHINKING THEORY AND
PRACTICE, Volume 63, p. 59-63\]

For Greene, [[authentic learning has the task of arousing]{.mark}
students' [imagination]{.mark}, [which 'allows]{.mark} [us to
break]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the [taken for granted**, to set aside
familiar**]{.mark}]{.underline} distinctions and
**[[definitions']{.underline}]{.mark}** (1995, p. 3). [[When]{.mark}
[students are provoked]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [use]{.mark}
their]{.underline} **[[imagination]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[they]{.mark}
are 'stirred to **[reach out on their own
initiatives']{.mark}**]{.underline} (Greene, 1995, p. 5). The point
about [[authentic learning is]{.underline}]{.mark} that it is considered
as [[releasing]{.underline}]{.mark} the imagination of students [[with
the intention to cultivate 'a]{.mark} [community]{.mark} always in the
making]{.underline} -- [the community [that **may someday be**]{.mark}
**called [a democracy]{.mark}'**]{.underline} (Greene, 1995, p. 6). In
other words, the emphasis Greene places on positive freedom as a
condition for authentic learning is quite obvious in the sense that
[[students]{.mark} are encouraged to **[break the chain of causes and
effects]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [of probabilities [in which they]{.mark}
usually [find themselves]{.mark} [entangled]{.mark}, and to come to be
themselves]{.underline}. In other words, [authentic learning involves
students taking initiative and **[looking at things as if they could be
otherwise]{.mark},**]{.underline} as has been mentioned previously in
this book (Greene, 1995, p. 16). So, tapping into imagination as a way
of enacting their positive freedom, students 'become able to break with
what is supposedly fixed and finished, objectively and independently
real. It is to see beyond \... and to carve out new orders in experience
\... to glimpse what might be, to form notions of what should be and
what is not yet (Greene, 1995, p. 19). Consequently[, authentic learning
always reaches **beyond itself** towards a completeness that can never
be attained.]{.underline} As aptly stated by Greene (1995, p. 28),
releasing students' imagination 'is not to resolve, not to point the
way, not to [improve[. It is to awaken, to disclose the ordinarily
unseen]{.mark}, unheard, and unexpected'. This makes authentic learning
a perpetual 'narrative in the making]{.underline}' (Greene, 1995, p. 5)
-- [a democratically educative experience 'that is always in the
making']{.underline} (Greene, 1995, p. 39). It is for the latter reason
that authentic (positive) learning is concomitantly linked to a
democratic education in becoming, where '\[n\]o one can predict
precisely the common world of possibility we will grow to \[co\]inhabit,
nor can we absolutely justify one kind of community over another'
(Greene, 1995, p. 167) -- that is, pedagogical encounters remain out of
bounds. [[A democratic community of possibility]{.underline}]{.mark} in
which individuals co-exist, says Greene, [[is one that embraces
pluralism and does 'not fly apart in violence]{.mark} and
disorder]{.underline}' (1995, p. 167). [Such a community of possibility
engages individuals to 'speak with others as eloquently and passionately
as]{.underline} \... \[[they\] can about **justice** and **caring** and
**love** and **trust'**]{.underline} (Greene, 1995, p. 167). In a way,
Greene's call for a democratic community of possibility [-- a democratic
community in becoming -- intimates]{.underline} that teachers and
[[students]{.underline} **[become more responsive to societal
injustices]{.underline}**, [such as people being subjected to
insecurity]{.underline}]{.mark} as a result of crime and violence; those
[[suffering]{.mark} [under]{.mark} corrupt governments and
[dictatorships]{.mark}]{.underline}; and others stunned by lives [in
refugee camps]{.underline}. Therefore, teachers 'need to be attentive
and vigilant if \... \[they\] are to open texts and spaces, \[and\] if
\... \[they\] are to provoke the young \[students\] to be free' (Greene,
1995, p. 121). Greene places vigilance at the centre of the concept of
authentic learning and suggests some interesting distinctions that
further expand the concept. Authentic learning therefore gains a new
meaning that perhaps is beyond current human understandings if thought
of in relation to vigilance. In the first instance, [[**to be vigilant**
is 'to awaken']{.mark} in students an awareness of [the '**ordinarily
unseen**]{.mark}, unheard, and unexpected']{.underline} (Greene, 1995,
p. 28). To be vigilant is to be cautious and suspicious, yet attentive
and open to something different and new. This view of vigilance is
corroborated by Applebaum (2013, p. 19), who states that vigilance
'involves listening not simply to confirm what is already known but
listening to hear something new \...'. More importantly,
[vigilance]{.underline} [implies being **able [to listen to the voices
of the marginalised]{.mark}**]{.underline} when they suffer injustices
-- that is, vigilance insists that teachers and students show their
'outrage at injustices' (Greene, 1995, p. 42). In this way,
[vigilance]{.underline} [does not only involve]{.underline} [listening
to]{.underline} [what is beyond recognition, but also that teachers and
students remain]{.underline} [in discomfort about the
injustices]{.underline} **[and 'identify moments where the new can
emerge]{.underline}**' (Applebaum, 2013, p. 34) -- that is, where new
authentic learning can occur. Such a notion of vigilance intimates the
possibility that students take an ethical and political stand. And when
students act ethically and politically they listen with an openness so
that there is always more to learn -- they are stirred 'to
wide-awakeness, to imaginative action, and to renewed consciousness of
possibility' (Greene, 1995, p. 43). When vigilance interrupts the minds
of [[students]{.underline}]{.mark} they [[become
'conscious']{.underline}]{.mark} -- that is, [pursue]{.underline} a kind
of [thinking that always involves a risk**, a [venture into the
unknown]{.mark},**]{.underline} [[and thus become **open to new ways of
looking at things**]{.underline}]{.mark}, what Greene refers to as
'**[[the making of a democratic community']{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Greene, 1998, p. 126). A potent example of authentic learning in which
vigilance is at play, and of the notion of a democratic community in
becoming, is poignantly illustrated in the film In the land of blood and
honey , directed by Angelina Jolie in 2011. Against the backdrop of the
Bosnian war in the 1990s, when Serbs committed atrocious genocidal acts
against Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims and Croats), Danijel, a soldier
fighting for the Serbs, falls in love with Ajla, a Muslim. The romantic
relationship soon garnered the dissatisfaction of Danijel's ruthless
father -- a Yugoslav People's Army general, and Danijel and Ajla were
confronted with the unfamiliar, the unexplored, and the unexpected.
Ajla, once used as a human shield by Serbs against resistant fighters,
also witnessed the genocidal killings and sniper assassinations, and the
torturous rapes of women (including herself) in prison camps. Danijel,
although in many ways sympathetic towards Bosniak killings as a
consequence of his love for a Muslim, could not look beyond his
parochialism towards pluralism and accept that every person had a
legitimate right to life, irrespective of one's hatred for them. Only
when he himself eventually killed Ajla did he realise the senselessness
of the Bosnian war and surrender to the United Nations forces as a
criminal of war. Now for Danijel to have acted vigilantly and with the
human freedom to enact justice towards those whom he disliked would have
harnessed his learning in an authentic way. It is not that he did not
learn from his dogmatic blindness and prejudice towards unjust Serbian
atrocities. Of course he did, otherwise he would not have acted
unjustly. However, such learning is frivolous or useless, as he acted
freely under coercion from his father's external influence and the
suspicion he harboured towards the Bosniaks, who made an attempt on his
life by bombing a church that he attended. What Danijel failed to do,
unlike Ajla, was to have ventured into the unfamiliar, the improbable,
where there always was the possibility to think differently about his
situation. Ajla knew that her love affair with Danijel upset the
Bosniaks, yet she did not let the hatred of the Bosniaks blind her to
recognise even her torturers' (Serbs) right to existence. Unlike
Danijel, Ajla was prepared to embark on a new beginning (with Danijel),
in which they could have opened themselves up to the possibility of
human co-existence by writing the texts of their democratic community in
becoming. If a democratic community in becoming provides the space in
which human action is disclosed in potentially unexpected and
unpredictable ways, it makes sense to bring into the discussion Danjel's
predicament after he killed Ajla. If Danijel wanted to reverse his act
of having killed Ajla -- the one he loved -- he would have had to
consider two things: to seek the forgiveness of Ajla's community, and to
promise not to repeat his acts of violence towards other Bosniaks.
Therefore he gave himself up as a war criminal. In other words,
forgiving and promising are never enacted in solitude or isolation, but
rather, as stated by Hannah Arendt (1998, p. 237), in the 'public realm
through the presence of others \... for no one can forgive himself and
no one can feel bound by a promise made only to himself \...'. By
implication, [for human freedom to ensure rebeginnings it has to embark
on action informed by forgiveness]{.underline} and making promises.
[Forgiveness implies the unexpected public acknowledgement of one's act
of evil]{.underline} (even if possible, just retribution might ensue),
considering that one would be unable to undo the past, whereas promising
implies committing oneself in the presence of others to put an end to
something, such as heinous crimes that would go on endlessly if there
were no interference. In the words of Arendt, 'only through this
constant mutual release \[of forgiving and promising\] from what they do
can \[wo\]men remain free agents, only by constant willingness to change
their minds and start again can they be trusted with so great a power as
that, to begin something new' (Arendt, 1998, p. 240). Th[e issue of
forgiveness and making promises not to repeat unjust and undesirable
human action has implications for authentic learning.]{.underline}
Firstly, [teachers and students always act in community]{.underline}.
They are [dependent on one anothe]{.underline}r 'without intimacy and
without closeness' in that they treat one another with respect,
irrespective of the distance that the space of the world puts between
them (Arendt, 1998, p. 243). If students were to be guilty of committing
an unexpected and undesirable act -- such as bullying another student,
abusing drugs, or threatening a teacher -- there is always the
possibility that their transgressions will be subjected to the
correctives of forgiveness and making promises. [Condemnation and
exclusion perhaps would not be possible, as forgiveness and making
promises will engender possibilities to begin anew]{.underline}. A
common example in South African schools is the rising incidence of
pregnancies in teenage girls. The girls, upon informing the school of
their pregnancy, often find themselves in a situation where their
continuing attendance of school becomes extremely problematised by
unsupportive school structures, perhaps even judgemental teachers, and
they would encounter great difficulty in re-accessing the school after
they have given birth. In many respects, their appeals for compassion
and forgiveness either to their schools or their respective communities
are met by exclusion, rather than forgiveness and acceptance. Secondly,
[making and keeping promises has the potential to undermine the spurious
condition of sovereignty]{.underline} (Arendt, 1998, p. 245). In fact,
making promises in the presence of others binds a person in a
non-sovereign way to others and, for once, teachers' views might not be
considered as the sovereign and predicable calculations in pedagogical
encounters. Making promises has some connection with the inability of
individuals just to rely on themselves 'as isolated islands of
certainty' (Arendt, 1998, p. 244). Rather, by making and keeping
promises, teachers and students are connected in a non-sovereign way, so
that the mastery and predictability of human action becomes
self-defeating. There will always be more to learn and it would be
impossible for teachers and students to remain 'unique \[sovereign\]
masters of what they do' (Arendt, 1998, p. 244). Thirdly, human action
that takes the risk to forgive and be forgiven should make any
pedagogical encounter concerned with the possibility 'to start anew \...
in an ever-recurring cycle of becoming' (Arendt, 1998, p. 246). This
means that [[an authentic pedagogical encounter is]{.mark} always [an
interruption]{.mark} [and]{.mark} a [beginning]{.mark} of something new,
[especially in]{.mark} the [light of human]{.mark}
**[unpredictability]{.mark} and unreliability** [in a]{.mark} [world
marred by conflict]{.mark}, transgressions and suffering]{.underline}.
The point about [[authentic learning in a]{.mark} **[positively free
manner]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[unconstrained]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[by]{.underline}]{.mark} the sovereignty of [[the other]{.mark},
[is]{.mark} [the fact that]{.mark} [learning has no
end]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} that [what is to be learned will
**always be strange**]{.mark} to the one who learns
otherwise]{.underline}, learning will have reached its becoming.
[[Authentic learning]{.mark} in [becoming is **always open to the new,
the unexpected, the strange**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- a matter of
retaining the un-bounded and strangeness of both teaching and learning.
[Authentic learning]{.underline}, [[therefore]{.mark}, [includes]{.mark}
[being]{.mark} [confronted with]{.mark} incidents of bullying,
[discrimination]{.mark}]{.underline}, teenage pregnancies, teenage
suicide and [homophobia]{.underline} -- since these are all constitutive
of our societal condition and cannot be wished away. [Authentic learning
requires of teachers to be willing to deal with the aforementioned in an
open]{.underline} and unbiased [fashion]{.underline} so that what
emerges are forms of engagement that move towards recognition of
otherness and PEDAGOGY AND DIALECTIC OF FREEDOM 63 forgiveness of
transgressions. It is to a discussion of teaching as strangeness that I
now turn. TEACHING AND STRANGENESS [Authentic learning]{.underline}, as
has been argued for thus far, [has the best chance of being realised if
teachers in pedagogical encounters are attentive and
vigilant]{.underline}, provoking students to ethically and politically
open up the texts of their lived experiences. [Such pedagogical
encounters]{.underline} [would invariably remain open to the
unfamiliar]{.underline}, the unpredictable, the unexpected -- that is,
the possibility of rebeginnings would be enhanced through such
democratic spaces in which nothing remains certain and where there
always is the possibility to begin anew. In this way, [learning would be
authentic and informed by positive human freedom. Such an account of
authentic learning invariably depends on a particular way of
teaching]{.underline}, which Greene suggests should be associated with
strangeness (1995, p. 92). [The teacher as stranger enacts her rupture
as a way of finding herself in relation to others]{.underline} (her
students) as she cultivates a pedagogical encounter. [A teacher does not
arrogate students, but comes to experience students through the eyes of
a stranger in order 'to see' the unfamiliar, the unheard o]{.underline}f
(Greene, 1995, p. 92). In a way, teachers as strangers suspend both what
they desire to see and try to control students' desire. As aptly stated
by Jo Anne Pagano (1998, p. 260): Most students come to the texts we
teach as strangers. Greene teaches us that we must also come to those
same texts as strangers, even though the syllabus is ours and filled
with our questions, loaded with our desires. To teach our students to
read so as to teach \[positive\] freedom and to choose freedom of humane
action, we need to open landscapes to admit their questions, to change
the landscape by honoring the identities they bring to the series of
indentifications they will make.

#### Attempting to make the world predictable depresses vital energies 

**Grimm 77** (\[Ruediger Hermann, art historian and Goethe scholar,
*Nietzsche\'s Theory of Knowledge*, ed. M. Montinari, W. Miiller-Lauter
& H. Wenzel, Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, pg. 30-33, Gender modified\]

[Western logic and metaphysics have been]{.underline} traditionally
[founded upon]{.underline} a handful of [principles]{.underline} which
were [regarded as being self-evidently true]{.underline}, and therefore
neither requiring nor admitting of any further proof40• One of these
principles we have already dealt with at some length, the notion that
truth must be unchanging. Rather than further belabor the whole question
of truth, we shall now turn to Nietzsche\'s analysis of why it is that
truth should be regarded as necessarily unchanging in the first place.
Nietzsche\'s view of [[reality]{.underline}]{.mark} (the will to power)
is such that all that [exists [is]{.mark} an ever-changing
[chaos]{.mark} of power-quanta, continually struggling with one another
for hegemony. Nothing remains the same from one instant to the
next]{.underline}. Consequently [[there are no stable objects, no
\"identical cases,\"]{.mark} no facts, and no order]{.underline}.
[Whatever order we see in the world, we ourselves have
projected]{.underline} into it. By itself, the world has no order [:
there is no intrinsically stable \"world order,\" no \"nature.\" Yet
metaphysics, logic, and language]{.underline} indeed, our whole
conceptual scheme [is grounded in the assumption that there is such a
stable order]{.underline}. Why? . • . die Annahme des seienden ist
nothig, um denken und schliessen zu konnen : die Logik handhabt our
Formeln fiir Gleichbleibendes deshalb ware diese Annahme noch ohne
Beweiskraft fiir die Reali tat : ,,das Seiende\" gehort zu unserer
Optik48• This can perhaps be best clarified by anticipating our
discussion of Nietzsche\'s perspectivism. Even if reality is a chaos of
power-quanta, about which any statement is already an interpretation and
\"falsification,\" we nevertheless must assume some sort of order and
continuity in order to function at all. But the assumption of order and
continuity even if it is a necessary assumption is certainly not any
sort of proof. [[We]{.mark} ourselves, as will to power, [gain control
over our environment by \"interpreting\"]{.mark}]{.underline} it, by
simplifying and adapting it to our requirements. [Life itself is an
ongoing process of interpretation, a process of [imposing]{.mark} a
[superficial order]{.mark} upon a chaotic reality]{.underline}. In
Wahrheit ist Interpretation ein Mittel selbst, um Herr iiber etwas zu
werden. (Der organische Prozess setzt fortwahrendes /nterpretieren
voraus42• Thus we create for ourselves a world in which we can live and
function and further enhance and increase our will to power. Even [our
perceptual apparatus is not geared to gleaning \"truth\"]{.underline}
from the objects of our experience. Rather, it arranges, structures, and
interprets these objects so that we can gain control over them and
utilize them for our own ends. [The \"truth\" about things is something
we ourselves have projected onto them purely for the purpose of
furthering our own power]{.underline}. Thus Nietzsche can say Wahrheit
ist die Art von Irrthum, ohne welche eine bestimmte Art von lebendigen
Wesen nicht leben konnte. Der Werth fiir das Leben entscheidet
zuletzt43. Thus the \"truth\" about reality is simply a variety of
error, a convenient fiction which is nevertheless necessary for our
maintenance[. In the last analysis [it is not a question of
\"truth\"]{.mark} at all, [but rather]{.mark}, a matter of [which
\"fiction,\"]{.mark} which interpretation of reality [best enables me to
survive]{.mark} and increase my power.]{.underline} In an absolute
sense, the traditional standard of unchanging truth is no more true or
false than Nietzsche\'s own. But on the basis of Nietzsche\'s criterion
for truth we can make a vital distinction. [All statements about the
truth or falsity]{.underline} of our experiential world [are functions
of the will to power]{.underline}, and in this sense, all equally true
(or false). The difference lies in the degree to which any particular
interpretation increases or decreases our power. [[The notion that truth
is unchanging is]{.mark} the interpretation of a comparatively **[weak
will to power, which demands that the world be]{.mark} simple, reliable,
[predictable]{.mark}**]{.underline}, i. e. \"true.\" [[Constant change,
ambiguity, contradiction, paradox]{.underline}]{.mark}, etc. [are much
more difficult to cope with, and [require a]{.mark} comparatively [high
degree of will to power]{.mark} to be organized]{.underline} (i. e.
interpreted) into a manageable environment. The ambiguous and
contradictory the unknown is frightening and threatening. [Therefore [we
have constructed]{.mark} for ourselves [a model]{.mark} of reality
[which is eminently \"knowable,\"]{.mark} and consequently subject to
our control.]{.underline} Pain and suffering have traditionally been
held to stem from \"ignorance\" about the way the world \"really\" is :
the more predictable and reliable the world is, the less our chances are
of suffering through error, of being unpleasantly surprised. However, \"
darin driickt sich eine gedriickte Seele aus, voller MIBtrauen und
schlimmer Erfahrung . . . 44.\" [[The demand that reality]{.mark} and
truth [be]{.mark}]{.underline} stable, reliable,
[[predictable]{.underline}]{.mark}, and conveniently at our disposal
[[is]{.mark} a **symptom of [weakness]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[The glossing over of the chaotic]{.mark}, contradictory, changing
aspect of [reality is the sign of a will]{.mark} to power [which must
reduce]{.mark} the conflict and [competition]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
world [[to a minimum]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet resistance and
competition are the very factors which enable any particular
power-constellation to express itself and grow in power. As we saw
earlier, [the will to power can only express itself by meeting
resistance, and any [interpretation]{.mark}]{.underline} of reality
[which attempts to minimize these factors [is **profoundly
anti-life**]{.mark}]{.underline} (since life is will to power).
Furthermore, [[a person embodying a strong]{.mark} and vigorous [will to
power will \"interpret\"]{.mark} the \"threatening\" aspect of the world
the [chaos]{.mark}]{.underline}, ambiguity, [contradiction,
danger]{.underline}, etc. [[as stimuli, which]{.mark} continually
[offer]{.mark} \[them\] a high degree of [resistance which \[they\]
must]{.mark} meet and [overcome]{.mark} if \[they are\] to survive and
grow. [Rather than negate change and make the world predictable, a
\"strong\" person would]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to Nietzsche,
[**[welcome the]{.mark} threat and [challenge]{.mark}** []{.mark}of a
constantly changing world]{.underline}. Referring to those who require a
world as changeless as possible in order to survive, Nietzsche says . .
. (eine umgekehrte Art Mensch wiirde diesen Wechsel zum Reiz rechnen)
Eine mit Kraft iiberladene und spielende Art W esen wiirde gerade die
Aff ekte, die Unvernunft und den Wechsel in eudamonistischem Sinne
gutheissen, sammt ihren Consequenzen, Gefahr, Contrast, Zu-Grunde-gehn
usw-45. A large part of the [intellectual energy]{.underline} of the
West [has been spent]{.underline} in [trying to discover
\"facts]{.underline},\" \"laws of nature,\" etc., [all of which are
conceived to be \"[truths]{.mark}\" and [which]{.mark}, therefore, [do
not change]{.mark}]{.underline}. For Nietzsche, [this conceptualization
of our experience [is tantamount to a \"mummification\"]{.mark} : when
an experience is conceptualized, it is wrenched from the everchanging
stream of becoming which is the world. [By turning]{.mark} our
[experiences into]{.mark}]{.underline} facts, concepts,
[[truths]{.underline}]{.mark}, statistics, etc. [[we \"kill\" them, rob
them of their]{.mark} immediacy and [vitality and embalm them,]{.mark}
thus transforming them [into the convenient bits of knowledge which
furnish our comfortable, predictable, smug
existences]{.mark}]{.underline}46• Der Mensch sucht ,,die Wahrheit\" :
eine Welt, die nicht sich widerspricht, nicht tiiuscht, nicht wechselt,
eine wahre Welt, eine Welt, in der man nicht leidet : Widerspruch,
Tauschung, Wechsel Ursachen des Leidens l47 For Nietzsche, [this whole
tendency]{.underline} to negate change which is so intimately connected
with the presupposition that \"truth\" always means \"unchanging,
eternal truth,\" [is a symptom of decadence, a symptom of the weakening
and disruption of the will to power]{.underline}. [This outlook
says]{.underline}, in effect, \"[[This far shall you go]{.mark}, and
this much shall you learn, **[but no more than
this]{.mark}**]{.underline} . . . . \" In the absence of any fixed and
ultimate standard for truth, of course, this outlook is no more true or
false than Nietzsche\'s own. Yet [it is not a question here of rightness
or wrongness, but a question of]{.underline} power. More specifically,
it is a matter of [vital power]{.underline}. \"Der Werth fur das Leben
entscheidet zuletzt48.\" Nietzsche\'s conclusion is that [this
[static]{.mark} world [interpretation has a negative]{.mark}, depressing
[effect on a person\'s vital energies ]{.mark}]{.underline}(will to
power). [[It]{.mark} constricts growth, it [**sets limits** and
hampers]{.mark} the self-assertion of the [will to power.]{.mark} The
strong individual]{.underline}, whom Nietzsche so much admires,
[flourishes only in an environment of change, ambiguity, contradiction,
and danger]{.underline}. [The chaotic and threatening aspect of the
world is a stimulus for such individuals]{.underline}, demanding that
they constantly grow and increase their power, or perish49• [It demands
that they constantly exceed their previous limits, realize their
creative potential and surpass it, become more than they
were]{.underline}. [[In the absence of]{.mark} any [stability]{.mark} in
the world, [the strong individual]{.mark} who can flourish in such an
environment [is radically free from any constraint, **radically free to
create**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It need scarcely be said that
[this]{.underline} world-interpretation [is immeasurably more conducive
to]{.underline} the [growth and enhancement of the will to power than
the static worldview]{.underline}. And the increase of will to power is
Nietzsche\'s only criterion : Alles Geschehen, alle Bewegung, alles
Werden als ein Feststellen von Gradund Kraftverhaltnissen, als ein
Kampf.

#### Militarized knowledge DA\-\--centering debate around technocratic analysis of defense policy fuels imperial violence 

**Bond-Graham and Hell 3** - PhD Sociology UC Santa Barbara AND UC Fiat
Pax Research Project Group (Darwin and Emily, "THE MILITARIZATION OF
AMERICA'S UNIVERSITIES",
<http://santacruz.indymedia.org/usermedia/application/5/ucsc_demil.pdf>,
dml)

[The militarization of knowledge is found in its pure form in the
university. [Militarized knowledge is a way of knowing the world]{.mark}
and relationships between humans, [characterized by an acceptance and
promotion of violence and war]{.mark}]{.underline}. In militarized
society we come to know the world and our fellow humans in terms of the
hostile other. Other nations become enemies. Other peoples become
dehumanized. [[The world becomes]{.mark} possess-able if we are strong
enough, [disposable]{.mark} if we so choose. [Militarized knowledge
adopts a worldview of]{.mark} force **not understanding**,
[violence]{.mark} **not peace**. Militarized society relies on knowledge
to create technological solutions to our problems and
conflicts]{.underline}. [This is **always** at the expense of humanistic
knowledge -- the ways of knowing and relating to the world which find
solutions in peace and organization]{.underline}, not violence and
quantity. [[Because universities are **at the center** of knowledge
creation]{.mark} in our society, [we find our institutions of higher
learning imbued with violence. The militarization of universities leads
to a spiraling effect further strengthening the forces of war]{.mark}.
Militarized universities produce]{.underline}: military technologies
including -- new weapons, warfare systems, [ways of thought and
organization distinct to the goals of coercion and force]{.underline},
and the permanent technological revolution of warfare itself.
[Universities in service of the warfare state also produce the human
resources demanded by the militarized society. [Universities churn out
the **politicians**, **technocrats**, **bureaucrats**, and **skilled
workers** demanded by the society which so diligently **produces** and
**executes** the means of destruction.]{.mark} [These graduates, having
learned about the world]{.mark}]{.underline}, its society, and applied
sciences [[through the lens of warfare go forth and **recreate this
calamity**]{.mark}. The future [politicians will lead the nation
into]{.mark} future [wars]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the future engineers
will construct future combat systems, [[while we all]{.mark} obey and
simply \"**[do our jobs]{.mark}**.\" The system **further entrenches
itself**, war begets war, the institutions of knowledge produce
destruction at the expense of creation]{.underline}. [The technologies
meant to banish war as unimaginabley destructive, and obsolete have only
accomplished the former. New technologies meant to make war more humane,
and conductable have only accomplished the latter]{.underline}.
TechnoWar & How the University Makes War Possible [The greatest effect
the militarization of universities has had is by making war more
conductable. Modern America]{.underline}, being the "civilized" and
"peaceful" society it is, [will not conduct a war that extols to large a
cost in innocent civilian lives,]{.underline} and the lives of US
soldiers. [The technological revolution in aerial
bombardment]{.underline}, missile capabilities, and weapon accuracy
since the Vietnam war [was intended to address this very issue. By
making weapons more accurate and deployable from a distance, the
military]{.underline} and its partners in science [hoped to remove the
US soldier from combat equation, while making state violence humane and
survivable. This supposed injection of ethics into the arsenal of the
United States was **lauded**]{.underline} in the Gulf War, Afghan War,
and now with unprecedented emphasis in the second war against Iraq. [War
becomes more automated, increasingly technology withdraws the soldier
from the battlefield]{.underline}. The arsenal becomes deployable
through computer interfaces, warfighters sit behind computer screens
hundreds, even thousands of miles from where they wreak havoc. [Soldiers
who must still encounter the enemy face to face are made into
superhumans with high tech body armor, night vision, network
communications, advanced sensors, all intended to make the US soldier
invulnerable.]{.underline} Science in the service of warfare reinforces
a political establishment more willing to use violence than diplomacy.
[US politicians become sure of their military's capabilities to defeat
the enemy, and to do so in a manner that the American public can
accept]{.underline}. The population falls into a similar mindstate. The
technological revolution to make war more effectively against the enemy
leads us only to more war. Does science, technology, and knowledge
emanating from our universities produce an ethical and just form of
warfare? [Can war be made humane through technological solutions?
**Absolutely not** -- Historically we know this. New
technology]{.underline} leveraged in war [has had the net effect of
**more war** and **more killing**. Most prominent are the examples of
past weapons whose inventors claimed would make war impossible. The
machine gun]{.underline} being the most famous case [was said to have
made warfare so destructive and technologically advanced that nations
would no longer fight. World War I immediately ensued]{.underline}, and
millions died. The technologies meant to banish war as unimaginabley
destructive, and obsolete have only accomplished the former. New
technologies meant to make war more humane, and conductable have only
accomplished the latter. [[What is at Stake? **The future, and
everything**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The university takes its namesake
from this fact. In Latin, universum - \"The whole of created or existing
things regarded collectively.\" [[The university is **the whole of human
knowledge**]{.mark}; the knowledge we have about our
existence]{.underline}, past present and future. [The university is the
attempt of the scientific system of knowledge to understand the human
condition, our place in the world, and the realm of
possibility]{.underline}. The university is more: In its most worthy
incarnation, [the university makes room for, even thrives from
nonscientific, non-rational forms of knowledge including the arts and
humanities]{.underline}. It is inarguably the most powerful attempt
humanity has made to understand and re-make the world. With this fact in
mind [there are two conclusions to be drawn from the militarization of
the university]{.underline}. [First, [it can be
described]{.mark}]{.underline} as simply a matter of fact [[that
knowledge creation and the university serve the military]{.mark}. Humans
make war with one another, and that universities are involved in this
effort is a truism]{.underline}. Humans will continue to make war, and
so the inclusion of the university should be expected. [This answer is
of no value. It assumes a set of universal permanent truths (a nature)
about the human condition **with no possibility of
disproving**]{.underline}. Furthermore [it offers **no future for
humanity** **other than annihilation**]{.underline}, and it completely
betrays the fundamental idealogical basis of the university which is
progress through enlightenment. [In contrast, it can be said that [the
militarization of universities is a problem **directly related** to the
condition of a society]{.mark}]{.underline}. [How much and in what ways
a society's institutions of knowledge creation serve the forces of war
is a measure of that society's worth. A nation that demands the
enlistment of its knowledge base in the production of war and the
perpetuation of violence is a nation not worthy of life. [The only
alternative]{.mark}s left [would be]{.mark} the dismantling of that
nation, or [a **radical reform** of its institutions and a fight against
the forces of war. This]{.mark}]{.underline} publication [[is dedicated
to nothing less than the **complete** and **radical** reform of our
society's **institutions of knowledge creation**, from universities in
service of the warfare state, to universities in resistance]{.mark}, in
peace, [and toward the creation of a meaningful
future.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Dear Joe MIller, Yes, the statement about the American debate circuit
you refer to was made by me, though some years ago. I strongly believed
then \--and still do, even though a certain uneasiness about
\"objectivity\" has crept into the \"philosophy of debate\" \-- that
[[debate]{.underline}]{.mark} in both the high schools and colleges in
this country [[is assumed to take place nowhere]{.mark}, even though the
issues that are debated are profoundly historical, which means that
positions are always represented from the perspective of power, and a
matter of life and death. I find it grotesque that in the debate world,
it [doesn\'t matter which position you take]{.mark} on an issue \-- say,
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates\' [unilateral wars of
preemption \-- [as long as you \"score points\"]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The world we live in is a world entirely dominated by an
\"exceptionalist\" America]{.underline} which has perennially claimed
that it has been chosen by God or History to fulfill his/its \"errand in
the wilderness.\" [That claim is powerful because American economic and
military power lies behind it]{.underline}. [And any alternative
position in such a world is virtually powerless]{.underline}. [Given
this inexorable historical reality, [to assume]{.mark}]{.underline}, as
the protocols of debate do, **[[that all positions are equal is to
efface the imbalances of power that are the fundamental condition of
history]{.underline}]{.mark}** and to annul the Moral authority inhering
in the position of the oppressed. This is why I have said that the
appropriation of my interested work on education and empire to this
transcendental debate world constitute a travesty of my intentions. [My
scholarship is not \"disinterested.\"]{.underline} [It is militant and
intended to ameliorate as much as possible the pain and suffering of
those who have been oppressed by the \"democratic\" institutions that
have power precisely by way of showing that their language of \"truth,\"
far from being \"disinterested\" or \"objective]{.underline}\" as it is
always claimed, is informed by the will to power over all manner of
\"others.\" This is also why I told my interlocutor that he and those in
[the [debate]{.mark} world]{.underline} who felt like him [[should call
into question the]{.mark} traditional [\"objective\" debate protocols
and the]{.mark} instrumentalist [language they privilege]{.mark} in
favor of a concept of debate and of language in which life and death
mattered.]{.underline} I am very much aware that [**[the arrogant
neocons who now saturate the government]{.mark}** of the Bush
administration]{.underline} \-- judges, pentagon planners, state
department officials, etc. [**[learned their \"disinterested\"]{.mark}
argumentative [skills in]{.mark}** []{.mark}the high school and [college
**debate societies**]{.mark} **and** tha]{.underline}t, accordingly,
**[they [have become masters at disarming]{.mark} the [just causes of
the oppressed]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This kind leadership will
reproduce itself]{.underline} (along with the invisible oppression it
perpetrates) [as long as the training ground]{.underline} and the debate
[protocols from which it emerges remains in tact. A revolution in the
debate world must occur]{.underline}. [It must force that unworldly
world down into the historical arena where positions make a
difference]{.underline}. To invoke the late Edward Said, [only such a
revolution will be capable of \"deterring democracy\"]{.underline} (in
Noam Chomsky\'s ironic phrase), of instigating the secular critical
consciousness that is, in my mind, the sine qua non for [avoiding the
immanent global disaster]{.underline} [towards which the ~~blind~~
arrogance of Bush Administration and his neocon policy makers is
leading]{.underline}.

#### Elite overproduction DA\-\--society is already oversaturated with "skilled advocates"\-\--training more leads to resentment and political instability 

**Economist 20** - citing Peter Turchin (Economist,
<https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/10/24/can-too-many-brainy-people-be-a-dangerous-thing>,
EM)

[[As far back as ancient Rome and imperial China,]{.underline}]{.mark}
Mr Turchin shows, [[societies have veered from periods of political
stability to instability]{.mark},]{.underline} often at intervals of
about 50 years. Consider America. Every pundit knows that Congress has
become gridlocked, with Democrats and Republicans unwilling to
compromise with each other. Fewer know that it was also highly polarised
around 1900, before becoming more co-operative in the mid-20th century.
[[What causes these lurches from calm to chaos?]{.underline}]{.mark} Mr
Turchin views societies as large, complex systems that are subject to
certain patterns, if not laws. That is an entirely different approach
from much of academic history, with its preference for small-scale,
microcosmic studies, argues Niall Ferguson of Stanford University. In a
paper published this year Mr Turchin (with Andrey Korotayev of the
Higher School of Economics in Russia) examines the prediction of
instability he made in 2010. His forecast model contains many elements,
but [like Karl Marx, Mr Turchin seems to believe that "the history of
all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles." Where
Marx focused on the proletariat, though, [Mr Turchin is]{.mark} more
[interested in the elite]{.mark}---[and how its members struggle against
each other.]{.mark}]{.underline} Who counts as the elite, and how
competition manifests itself, varies from place to place; one example
could be a large number of highly educated folk relative to the number
of government offices (and therefore jobs). But a [struggle is most
likely when economic inequality is high.]{.underline} The [rewards for
being at the top are]{.underline} then [especially
lucrative]{.underline}, both in terms of earning power and political
influence, [and those who miss out feel their loss more keenly. The
feeling of [resentment]{.mark} is particularly [strong among people
brought up to believe that they ought to be in the elite. Worse still,
societies tend to produce ever more would-be elites,]{.mark} in part
[because access to education]{.mark} tends to
[improve]{.mark}]{.underline} over time. Mr [Turchin sees all this as a
[recipe for political chaos.]{.mark} [Articulate, educated people rebel,
producing a scramble for]{.mark} political and economic [power. Elites
stop co-operating, counter-elites emerge, and order breaks
down.]{.mark}]{.underline} The argument undoubtedly papers over
historical nuance. Yet [focusing on dissatisfied elites is not a bad way
of understanding political instability.]{.underline} Hugh Trevor-Roper,
a historian, noted that "social crises are caused not by the clear-cut
opposition of mutually exclusive interests but by the tug-of-war of
opposite interests within one body." The French Revolution was not
primarily the product of misery but instead of a battle between an
underemployed educated class and hereditary landowners. Historians
identify "the problem of an excess of educated men" as contributing to
Europe's revolutions of 1848. Mr Turchin suggests that though slavery
was the proximate cause of the American civil war, a more fundamental
one was resentment from up-and-coming Northern capitalists towards
stuck-in-their-ways Southerners. [[Elite overproduction]{.mark} can also
help [explain the malaise gripping the rich world of late.]{.mark} It
has become extraordinarily difficult for a young person to achieve elite
status, even if she works hard and goes to the best
university.]{.underline} House prices are so high that only inheritors
stand a chance of emulating the living conditions of their parents. The
power of a few "superstar" firms means that there are few genuinely
prestigious jobs around. Mr [[Turchin reckons that each year America
produces some 25,000 "surplus" lawyers.]{.mark}]{.underline} Over [30%
of British graduates are "overeducated" relative to their jobs. [All
this goes some way to explaining]{.mark} an apparently puzzling trend:
[why apparently well-off people are drawn to
radicalism.]{.mark}]{.underline} Under Jeremy Corbyn Britain's Labour
Party attracted more upper-middle- and middle-class folk than it used
to, even as it moved further left from the Tories; its lead among recent
graduates was clear. Joe Biden's lead over Bernie Sanders in opinion
polls during the Democratic primaries was far smaller among
college-educated Americans than among those who did not finish high
school.

#### Content-based restrictions stymie efforts to overcome militarized education - refusing limits is key to encourage improvisation and creativity 

**Graeber 15** \[David Graeber, arguably the most important

Secret Joys of Bureaucracy,* Melville House printing (Brooklyn, NY):
February 2015, p. 201-5\]

Let me finish with another example from my own political experience.
Over the last thirty or forty years, anti-authoritarians around the
world have been working on creating new, and more effective, modes of
direct democracy-ones that might operate without any need for a
bureaucracy of violence to enforce them. I\'ve written about these
efforts extensively elsewhere. A lot of progress has been made. But
those working on such projects often find themselves having to deal with
exactly this sort of horror of \"arbitrary\" power. [[Part of]{.mark}
the work of [developing new forms of consensus]{.mark} process, for
example, [is to]{.mark} **create institutional forms that
[encourage]{.mark}**, **rather than inhibit, [improvisation and
creativity]{.mark}.**]{.underline} As activists sometimes put it: in
most circumstances, if you bring together a crowd of people, that crowd
will, as a group, behave less intelligently, and less creatively, than
any single member of the crowd is likely to do if on their own.
**[[Activist decision-making]{.mark} process [is]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
instead, **[[designed to make that crowd smarter and more imaginative
than any individual participant]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is indeed
possible to do this, but it takes a -lot of work. And the larger the
group, the more formal mechanisms have to be put in place. The single
most important essay in this whole activist tradition is called \"The
Tyranny of Structurelessness;\'110 written in the 1970s by Jo Freeman,
about organizational crises that occurred in early feminist
consciousness-raising circles when those groups began to attain a
certain size. Freeman observed that such groups always started out with
a kind of rough-and-ready anarchism, an assumption that there was no
need for any formal, parliamentary rules-of-order type mechanisms at
all. People would just sit down in a sisterly manner and work things
out. And this was, indeed, what happened at first. However, as soon as
the groups grew to over, say, twenty people, informal cliques invariably
began to emerge, and small groups of friends or allies began controlling
information, setting agendas, and wielding power in all sorts of subtle
ways. Freeman proposed a number of different formal mechanisms that
might be employed to counteract this effect, but for present purposes,
the specifics don\'t really matter. Suffice it to say that what is now
referred to as \"formal consensus process\" largely emerges from the
crisis Freeman described, and the debate her intervention set off. What
I do want to bring attention to is that almost everyone who is not
emerging from an explicitly anti-authoritarian position-and no
insignificant number even of those who are-completely misread Freeman\'s
essay, and interpret it not as a plea for formal mechanisms to ensure
equality, but as a plea for more transparent hierarchy. Leninists are
notorious for this sort of thing, but Liberals are just as bad. I can\'t
tell you how many arguments I\'ve had about this. They always go exactly
the same way. First, Freeman\'s argument about the formation of cliques
and invisible power structures is taken as an argument that any group of
over twenty people will always have to have cliques, power structures,
and people in authority. The next step is to insist that if you want to
minimize the power of such cliques, or any deleterious effects those
power structures might have, the only way to do so is to
institutionalize them: to take the de facto cabal and turn them into a
central committee (or, since that term now has a bad history, usually
they say a coordinating committee, or a steering committee, or something
of that sort.) One needs to get power out of the shadows-to formalize
the process, make up rules, hold elections, specify exactly what the
cabal is allowed to do and what it\'s not. In this way, at least, word
again. It comes from accountancy procedures.) It won\'t in any sense be
arbitrary. From a practical, activist perspective, this prescription is
obviously ridiculous. It is far easier to limit the degree to which
informal cliques can wield effective power by granting them no formal
status at all, and therefore no legitimacy; whatever \"formal
accountability structures\" it is imagined will contain the
cliques-now-turned-committees can only be far less effective in this
regard, not least because they end up legitimating and hence massively
increasing the differential access to information which allows some in
otherwise egalitarian groups to have greater power to begin with. As I
pointed out in the first essay, structures of transparency inevitably,
as I\'ve described, begin to become structures of stupidity as soon as
that takes place. So say one argues this point, and the critic concedes
it (which usually they have to because it\'s pretty much common sense).
If so, the next line of defense is generally aesthetic: the critic will
insist it\'s simply distasteful to have structures of real power that
are not recognized and that can, even if they entirely lack any degree
of violent enforcement, be considered arbitrary. Usually, one\'s
interlocutor won\'t go so far as actually admitting their objections are
aesthetic. Usually they will frame their arguments in moral terms. But
occasionally, you will find some honest enough to admit that\'s what\'s
going on. I well remember having an Occupy Wall Street-sponsored debate
in Central Park (I\'m sure it\'s recorded somewhere) with Norman
Finkelstein-a brilliant and altogether admirable activist, who had come
of age with the Civil Rights Movement and still saw groups like the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference as his inspiration. At this
debate, Finkelstein stated the matter outright. Maybe it\'s true, he
admitted, that the best way to keep such cliques from attaining too much
power is to maintain a principle that they should not exist. But as long
as such cliques are allowed to exist without being formally acknowledged
and regulated, you\'re maintaining a system that says it\'s okay to be
governed, even a tiny bit, from the shadows. It might not be that much
of a practical problem. You might well be right that formally
recognizing their existence might actually end up creating less overall
freedom than leaving well enough alone. But in the final analysis, I
just find the idea of being governed from the shadows, in any sense,
distasteful. In such arguments, **[[we are witnessing a direct clash
between]{.mark} two different forms of materialized
utopianism]{.underline}**: on [the one hand, [an
**anti-authoritarianism** that,]{.mark} in its emphasis on creative
synthesis and improvisation[, **sees freedom**]{.mark} **basically [in
terms of play]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} on the other, [a
**tacit republicanism that sees freedom** ]{.mark}**ultimately [as the
ability to reduce]{.mark} all forms of [power to a set of clear]{.mark}
and transparent [rules]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} For the last two
hundred years, in Europe and North America- and increasingly,
elsewhere-that latter, bureaucratized notion of freedom has tended to
hold sway. New institutional arrangements that operate by rules so
strict and predictable they essentially disappear, so that one doesn\'t
even know what they are (such as the physical or electronic post offices
with which I began) tend to be put forward as platforms for human
freedom that emerge from the very technical contingencies of running
efficient structures of power. These arrangements seem to preserve the
positive elements of play while somehow circumventing its more
disturbing potentials. But time and again, we have seen the same
results. [Whether motivated by a faith in \"rationality\" or a fear of
arbitrary power, [the]{.mark} end [result of]{.mark} **this
[bureaucratized]{.mark}** notion of **[freedom]{.mark}** [is to move
toward]{.mark} the dream of [a world where play has been limited
entirely]{.mark}]{.underline}-[[or]{.underline}]{.mark}, at best,
**[[boxed away in some remote location]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[far
from any serious, consequential human endeavor-[while every aspect of
life is reduced to some kind of]{.mark} elaborate, [rulebound
game]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [It\'s not that such a vision lacks appeal.
Who hasn\'t dreamed of a world where everyone knows the rules, everyone
plays by the rules, and-even more-where people who play by the rules can
actually still win? The problem is that this is just as much **a utopian
fantasy** as a world of absolute free play would be. **It will always
remain a glimmering illusion that dissolves away as soon as we touch
it**]{.underline}. [Such illusions are not always bad
things]{.underline}. One could make a case that most of the greatest
human accomplishments were the result of such quixotic pursuits. [But
**in this particular case**, and **[in]{.mark} this [larger
political]{.mark}-economic [context]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[[where
bureaucracy has been the primary means by which a tiny percentage of the
population extracts wealth from the rest of us]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[they have created a situation where the pursuit of freedom from
arbitrary power simply [ends up producing more **arbitrary**
power,]{.mark}s and]{.underline} as a result, **[regulations choke
existence]{.underline}**, [armed guards and surveillance cameras appear
everywhere]{.underline}, **[science [and creativity are
smothered,]{.mark} and all of us end up finding increasing percentages
of our day taken up in the filling out of forms]{.underline}**.

### AT: Skills

#### Policy debates are an endless production of mediocre case-law journalism, which translates the outside world into intellectually complicated, but ultimately vacuous jargon\-\--procedural constraints on deliberation are irrational conceits of our own making

**Schlag 9** \[Pierre, Byron R. White Professor of Law and Former
Associate Dean for Research, University of Colorado Law School, "ESSAY
AND RESPONSE: Spam Jurisprudence, Air Law, and the Rank Anxiety of
Nothing Happening (A Report on the State of the Art)," March, 2009,
Georgetown Law Journal, 97 Geo. L.J. 803\] \*\*edited for ableist
language

All of these three moments\--the Langdellian systematizations, the
realist revolt, the \"law and . . .\" enlightenment\--were reinventions
of the discipline. They failed in the sense that they failed to
reproduce themselves as vital intellectual enterprises. But they did not
fail in making people think. Now, [[we live amidst]{.mark} their
[ruins]{.mark}. We are [in need of another re-invention]{.mark}. [That
does not seem to be happening. Instead]{.mark} what [we have]{.mark}
is]{.underline}: A. CASE-LAW JOURNALISM **[[Case-law
journalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** is a legacy of Langdellianism. As an
intellectual enter-prise, Langdellianism came to an end when the work of
taxonomic organization was completed. Now, as mentioned above,
Langdellianism did leave some \[\*822\] academics in each field to do
the useful work of entering the new cases into the old taxonomies and to
make modest modifications of the latter whenever it seemed advisable.
This took care of keeping six or seven legal academics in each field
busy (for a lifetime). n45 As for the other what\--ninety-eight
percent?\--they would have to do something else. The legal academy
clearly did not need five hundred contracts teachers to write treatises
on contracts (six would do). How then to keep the other 494 duly
employed? A three-pronged answer: (1) heighten the intricacy of
analysis, (2) let the academics issue lots of normative recommendations,
and (3) have them argue incessantly amongst themselves. The possibility
of outdoing the courts in terms of intricacy was a natural for the legal
academy. Courts have dockets. Legal academics have time. Given this
asymmetry, the academics could always outdo the courts in the intricacy
of their analysis. For legal academics, more searching, more precise,
more detailed analyses were always possible. And it was also possible
along the way to chastise the courts for their analytical shallowness.
Indeed, one legal-process wag in the 1950s once complained very soberly
that the essential work of the Supreme Court was suffering because the
Justices clearly did not have sufficient time to give proper attention
to writing their opinions. n46 The second possibility\--to issue lots of
normative recommendations\--was also a successful full-employment
strategy. To the extent that legal academics could make recommendations
to the courts as to what should be done, the work would never dry up.
Indeed, normative prescription pretty much opened up the world of legal
scholarship to the future\--in fact, to all kinds of futures, ranging
from the modestly improved to the wildly utopian. The third prong\--to
[[let the academics argue among themselves]{.underline}]{.mark}\--[was
also well suited for the legal academy]{.underline}. Surely [[if
Professor X had a better solution]{.mark} than the courts, then, of
course, [it]{.mark} [should be published]{.mark}. And surely [if
Professor Y found that]{.mark} Professor X\'s proposed solution was
somehow [flawed]{.mark}, it would be useful to [publish that
too]{.mark}.]{.underline} [And surely, further responses might also add
to the storehouse of knowledge]{.underline}. And surely too there would
be value-added for \[\*823\] Professor Z to show that while both
Professor X and Professor Y had made valuable contributions, neither of
them understood the problem quite as well as Professor Z. And so on. The
possibilities were endless (in a kind of mock common law sort of way).
And because all the legal materials (as had been demonstrated over and
over again) were fraught with contradictory values and imperatives, the
game could keep going forever. [These three prongs are very much a part
of case-law journalism]{.underline}. But they are too formal to capture
the ethos of the practice\--for [[this is a practice]{.mark}, not a set
of rules to follow, [not a model, but a well-settled]{.mark}, fully
socialized, [thoroughly **internalized way of thinking and
writing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. By way of analogy to this practice,
consider the mythical reporter covering the police beat. Think 1950\'s
film noir here. In the opening scene, the reporter waits at the police
station (today, by his pager) for the suspects to trickle in. The action
starts. He interviews the cops, then reads the arrest report, calls the
wife or husband or girlfriend, as appropriate. Then, should zeal strike,
he might visit the crime scene. In the end, he writes and files his
report, which is then published in the morning paper. Case-law
journalism is much the same except for three things. First, the case-law
journalist is a professor of law. And she writes law review articles,
not newspaper articles. Second, she does not wait by the police desk.
She is by her PC looking at Lexis or Findlaw or the SCOTUS website. n47
Third, unlike the journalist who is supposed to stick to the facts, the
case-law journalist inserts the cases into some sort of normative
narrative. Almost invariably, the case-law journalist ends on a cheery
normative prescription for betterment of law, nation, or world. (Indeed,
when was the last time you saw a law review article end on the note,
\"Oh my god, there\'s nothing we can do. We\'re ruined.\"?) [B. LCM The
most critical aspect of [case-law journalism]{.mark}]{.underline} and
its variations [is the submission of issues]{.underline}, problems,
artifacts, methods, or whatever else might come over the transom [to the
logic of judicial discourse in a way that [produces **legally cognizable
material**]{.mark}]{.underline} [(\"LCM\").]{.underline} There is a
great deal of LCM produced in the legal academy. One gets the sense here
of a great machine composed of many legal academics\--each one ready and
able to process the materials through the logic of judicial discourse.
In the early days, up until the late 1960\'s say, [it was mainly cases
that were crunched.]{.underline} Today, the field has opened up. [[We
will crunch anything]{.underline}]{.mark}. No matter what comes
up\--[[O.J.,]{.underline}]{.mark} thick description,
[[po]{.mark}st[mo]{.mark}dernism]{.underline},
[[blogs]{.underline}]{.mark}, Bush v. Gore, the anniversary of Brown v.
Board, [[anything]{.mark} at all]{.underline}\--[[we will turn it into
LCM]{.underline}]{.mark}. \[\*824\] When the thing really needs a lot of
crunching, we will hold a symposium and get a small group to crunch the
thing together. [We are ready, willing, and able to crunch the
stuff]{.underline} (any stuff) [and turn it into LCM]{.underline}. [The
consumption metaphor is also apt here]{.underline}. [Anything that comes
to us, we legal academics will chew on and ultimately digest. [Our job
is to be there]{.mark}\--[ready to process the cases]{.mark}, to answer
the call from CNN or NPR]{.underline} or 9NEWS, [to provide a pithy
quote for the morning paper, to argue importantly at the law review
symposium, [and]{.mark} then [to go back to our office]{.mark}s [and
**do**]{.mark} **[it again]{.mark}** the next day (for
life]{.underline}). This is not nothing, of course. If you do this, [it
allows you to display knowledge-mastery]{.underline}. In turn, [this
will please your dean and get you lots of lines in the alumni
magazine]{.underline}. [[Like this]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance:
[[Professor Brancroft]{.underline}]{.mark} [[spoke on at
NPR]{.underline}]{.mark} on July 20. He [[published three
articles]{.underline}]{.mark} on the Bankruptcy Act and Putative
Spouses\--and a sequel to his earlier . . . . He also [[presented a
talk]{.underline}]{.mark} at to the State Commission on special courts
and appeared on CNN to discuss . . . . [[And so on]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Or **[[more candidly]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [Professor
[Brancroft]{.mark} has not become a **world-class party
animal**]{.underline} (**[surprise]{.underline}**\--that one) [and **is
not visibly suffering from jungle rot**]{.underline}. [What\'s more,
**[he shows evidence of]{.mark} [working on]{.mark}** the kinds of
[**things** that the **mental giants** at CNN believe is **worth air
time**]{.mark}. So the upshot is that **he\'s doing something** and the
rest of us at the law school are doing something]{.underline}. [**[We
are all doing something]{.mark}**. [**The future looks bright**.]{.mark}
[So **give us your money please**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Legal thought
is]{.mark}]{.underline} a lot like that these days. Notice that if this
is the job description\--producing lots of LCM\--it\'s kind of hard to
have ideas. It is a lot like trying to have a truly creative idea in the
middle of taking a law school exam\--(which, as we all know, is seldom a
good idea). C. THE PERPETUAL LAW SCHOOL EXAM And there\'s a thought: the
state of the art really is **[[like a perpetual law school
exam]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The prototype of the contemporary legal
academic is someone who is constantly either preparing to take or is in
fact taking a law school exam. In one sense, of course, it\'s not quite
a law school exam because the law professor is talking about things that
are actually happening: court proceedings, legislative deliberations,
etc. On the other hand, it has that same sort of form\--[[answering
stock questions in terms of stock issues by deploying stock
arguments]{.underline}]{.mark}. Go to the blogs: I speak truth. This is
a weird job description. It is even weirder that people (besides the six
who are very helpfully writing the treatises in each field) would choose
to make this their job description when they could clearly choose to
make their job \[\*825\] description something else. I strongly suspect,
though I cannot prove, that this has a lot to do with the kinds of
people we hire. By and large, we vet people very seriously for doing
really well on exam-like tasks, writing law review kinds of things,
while hardly vetting them at all on anything else. Not surprisingly,
when they set about writing, many of them take up the familiar spot and
crunch of the perpetual law school exam. What else would they do? What
else could we reasonably expect? Even much of the recent flurry of
interdisciplinary activity seems to have come down to a highly
academicized case of LCM production. Earlier, in the introduction, we
encountered James Boyd White looking at the pile of reprints on his desk
with dread and ennui. n48 I ask you now to imagine something
different\--namely, a stack of interdisciplinary university press
monographs on your desk. The first thing to notice is their
covers\--beautiful colors, awesome designs. But then you imagine
actually reading one of them. Do you not, gentle reader, dread the
dryness of the prose, the lumbering lurch of the argument, and the
deadening thuds of the footnotes? n49 For apart from the striking cover,
is there not this uncanny sense that what you see before you is simply a
very, very, very long law review article? Still, we should take heart.
There may be something highly functional about all this. [As
intellectually pointless as [the perpetual law school exam]{.mark} may
be, it [serves to display mastery]{.mark}\--namely, mastery of the law
by the individual legal thinker]{.underline}. [To be really good at the
perpetual law school exam is to confirm that one is really well-prepared
to be a really good case-law journalist. Also [it]{.mark} [means]{.mark}
putting out [lots of LCM]{.mark}]{.underline}. The exercises also show
mastery at a higher level of abstraction[. [They show the
mastery]{.mark} of \"the law[\" over]{.mark} current [cultural
trends]{.mark}, intellectual currents, [and social events]{.mark}. This
is an important task because [it demonstrates]{.mark} performatively
[that law and its]{.mark} authorized [agents are still]{.mark}
[dominant]{.mark}]{.underline}. n50 LCM. Moreover[, case-law journalism
is the way in which we confirm to each other and to outside
parties]{.underline} (lawyers, judges, the press, tenure committees,
other departments in the university) [that we really are in possession
of some kind of expertise]{.underline}. And we are. [LCM does not just
happen. [It takes years of effort]{.mark} and hard work]{.underline}
\[\*826\] **[[to be really good at putting out]{.mark} first-rate
[LCM]{.mark}]{.underline}**. \<Schlag continues\> G. WHY THINGS WILL GET
WORSE Two things: Personnel and Institutionalization. Personnel. Well,
enough on that subject. Institutionalization. Ironically, it is
[[at]{.mark} this very moment\--[the moment when legal]{.mark}
[scholarship seems so]{.mark} thoroughly
[compromised]{.mark}]{.underline}\--[that [law schools have
decided]{.mark}]{.underline}, seemingly en masse, [[to]{.mark} intensify
the monitoring of scholarly quality and quantity as well as to
[enforce]{.mark} scholarly [output maximization
strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Law faculties and administration are
all increasingly heavily invested in mentoring, career positioning,
[[SSRN download rates]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[citation
indices]{.underline}]{.mark}, [article placement strategies, blog
announcements,]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} glossy
scholarship [[advertising]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It\'s]{.mark} all
[a]{.mark} kind [of massive \"no law professor left behind\"
scheme]{.mark}]{.underline}. All these techniques and strategies are
ways in which law professors and law schools can all watch each other
with great ease and in great detail. The important part is not so much
the watching, but rather that we all know we are being watched. [It\'s
[as if we]{.mark}]{.underline}, who are responsible for all this (and
this would seem to be nearly all of us), [[had read Foucault\'s account
of the panopticon]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[\*831\] **[[decided it was way cool and that we should institute our
own version as soon as possible]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The upshot sadly
is that, at the very moment (1) that some terribly unenlightening
paradigms are holding sway over legal scholarship, we also have (2) a
radical intensification of quantity and quality control mechanisms. For
my part, I believe it would vastly improve matters if at least one of
those two things were not happening. Things will get worse. On the
cheery side, one can always count on (1) the contributions of exogenous
forces and (2) the fact that Malthus was and still is wrong. I\'m a
reasonable person (as well as a law professor) so all I came back with
was one really tiny insight. Not only is it tiny, but it\'s not even
very original. And it begins like this: There is something pervasively
neurotic about the structures of contemporary life. The excruciating
intricacies of everyday demands, the symbolic overinvestment of meaning
in the trivial, the obsessive monitoring of everything to within an inch
of its life, the constant piling on of little local meta- and
infra-layers of thought\--all these things are, from the \[\*832\]
perspective of the river, pervasively neurotic. n64 Contemporary life
ensnares us in all sorts of little maze-games that seem to matter
tremendously and yet ultimately do not\--except in the negative sense
that they distract our attention from what does or at least could
matter. Now, lots of people have had this sort of insight\--the most
famous perhaps being Heidegger (the \"fallenness\" thing). n65 But my
insight, and it really isn\'t much of an insight at all, is about legal
scholarship. [I think [the practices]{.mark} and institutions
[of]{.mark} [contemporary legal scholarship]{.mark}]{.underline} (spam
jurisprudence, case law journalism, rank anxiety, nothing happening,
etc.) [[are]{.mark} extremely **[intense versions]{.mark}** [of this
generalized]{.mark} ~~neurotic~~ [structure]{.mark}]{.underline}. It\'s
as if we were all working really hard on an imaginary bus schedule.
Someone writes an article saying we need to optimize the number of
buses. Another person can\'t resist pointing out that it might be
preferable to start by optimizing the number of bus stops instead. Soon
someone writes that we should reconstruct the entire schedule. Someone
else will suggest that we should split the schedule along eight
different parts. Someone says, the eight parts are really sixteen. Some
truly original thinker says there are ten. And then, some ranker comes
along and starts ranking whose law school has the best bus scheduling
program going. And somebody else decides to hold a symposium on bus
schedule rankings. (Remember the traveling show on Bush v. Gore?) n66
And then fifty years from now, someone will write a book: How Should the
Bus Schedules of 2000-Whatever Have Been Decided? n67 Pretty soon,
we\'ve got a collective imaginary going and we\'re pushing buses and bus
stops all across pages of the Yale Law Journal and it all feels kind of
real and pretty important. And it\'s not hard to believe that it\'s
important. For one thing people are getting real rewards\--prestige
jobs, chairs, program funding\--for \[\*833\] imaginary bus schedule
breakthroughs. And adding to the increasing reality of the thing is the
undeniable fact that we can\'t just dismiss buses or bus schedules as
unreal. (If everything else fails, by the way, this is your takeaway:
Buses are real.) But the thing of it is, our legal academic bus schedule
remains imaginary. Even if it looks a lot like the real thing, it\'s
still imaginary. When we put out our bus schedule, no buses run. Word.
And no Rapid Transit District (RTD) that I know of is going to change
its schedule just because some new bus stop entries have been introduced
in the pages of the Yale Law Journal or wherever. Not going to happen.
So here we are, legal academics working on our collective imaginary bus
schedule. And one of the things that troubles me about this is that the
imaginary bus schedule is in some important ways not at all like the
RTD\'s bus schedule. The RTD faces real stakes. We legal academics
don\'t. Our reality principle\--to the extent we have one at all\--is
decidedly indeterminate: get tenure/avoid showing cause. So if we want
to construct a bus schedule with stops every ten yards (all in the name
of rigor or precision) then we can have at it. And realize, please, that
I\'m not being extreme here. It\'s not like this hasn\'t been done. Over
and over again. n68 And then there\'s the normativity thing. I once read
an article that purported to elaborate about what the Constitution
should be. Now what struck me as odd was that the author really did want
to free himself (and his reader) from any official pronouncements of
what the Constitution is. This struck me as incredibly weird. What an
odd thing to do. If the question \"What should the Constitution be?\" is
not anchored in what the Constitution is (whatever that might be), then
why not go for broke: I say let\'s have a constitution that guarantees
universal health care, tastes a lot like Ben & Jerry\'s ice cream, and
is laugh-out-loud funny. You leave it to me? I say: Go big. Is this
flip? Well, of course, it is. But hey, I\'m not the one who invented
this practice of normative legal thought. I\'m just pointing it out. In
fact, that\'s what I do these days. Check that: It\'s what I used to do.
I used to have a pretty good job as a satirist. Good working conditions.
Not much competition. I\'m out of business now: Legal thought satirizes
itself. For me now, it\'s all just point and shoot. There\'s something
gratuitous about legal scholarship. No one, of course, writes that the
constitution should be like Ben & Jerry\'s ice cream. But just what is
it that precludes anyone from suggesting that the Constitution should
guarantee universal health care. (I\'d be in favor\--I really would.)
The answer: \[\*834\] there are constraints on what we argue. [Sure
there are]{.underline}. n69 [And who generates . . . the constraints?
Well, in part, **we do:**]{.underline} n70 **[So [what we have is an
imaginary legal thought shaped by]{.mark} [imaginary collective
constraints]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[one of which is the injunction
that we]{.mark} should **[follow]{.mark} [those]{.mark} constraints
[with great rigor]{.mark}**]{.underline}. My question: [Is
this]{.underline} a [neurotic]{.underline} structure? [Yes]{.underline},
it is. Straight out\--full-flower. It has to be because [[without
the]{.mark} ~~neurosis, \[~~[obsession\], there would be nothing]{.mark}
there. **[No constraints at all]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Now please
understand: As a matter of form, I have nothing against collective
imaginaries. My only problem is this: [[if we]{.mark} law professors
**[have to work so hard]{.mark}**]{.underline} (and so painfully[)
[on]{.mark} our [collective imaginaries, **couldn\'t we pick something
more interesting, or important, or aesthetically enlivening, or morally
salient, or politically relevant than bus
schedules**]{.mark}?]{.underline} **[I mean, [couldn\'t
we]{.mark}]{.underline}**? [Uh, no]{.underline}. Which raises perhaps my
final point. It\'s not very nice, but someone\'s got to say it, and
apparently it\'s going to be me. As mentioned earlier, our people are
not cognitively challenged. They are, bell curve and all, very
intelligent. It is easy then for people like you and I, when we look at
the extreme intricacy of the work produced by these very intelligent
people, to associate the intricacy of their work with their manifest
intelligence. Indeed, we are likely to think of the relation in
reciprocal terms: Because they are intelligent, their work is intricate,
and because their work is intricate, it shows great intelligence. n71
But the thing I want to suggest as a possibility here is that all this
intricacy of legal scholarship is less a function of intelligence than
it is a manifestation of ~~neurosis~~ in the face of intractable
conflicts. What conflicts? Consider the prototypical needs of the legal
academic: A need to display great intelligence in a discourse (law) that
will ultimately not bear it. A need to contribute to disciplinary
knowledge in a discourse which is not really about knowledge or truth in
any profound sense of those terms. [[A need to say something]{.mark}
[intellectually respectable within a]{.mark} disciplinary [paradigm that
we know]{.mark}, on some level, [is intellectually
compromised]{.mark}]{.underline}. \[\*835\] [[A need to display control
over social, political, and economic transactions]{.mark} that are in
important senses **[not subject to control]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [A
need to activate moral and political virtue in a discourse that uses
both largely as window dressing.]{.underline} [[A need to make one\'s
thought seem real and consequential in a discourse that is
neither]{.underline}]{.mark}. I want to suggest then, and this is
perhaps the unkindest cut of all, that [within the dominant paradigm of
legal scholarship, it may be that there is very little of enduring value
to be said.]{.underline} [In the main it\'s the rehearsal of a form, a
genre\--**and not a self-evidently good one**]{.underline}. n72 I have a
cheery ending and a not so cheery ending [[The cheery ending is that it
has not always been like this]{.mark}. And, **[maybe it doesn\'t have to
be]{.mark}** like this [now]{.mark}]{.underline}. The non-cheery ending
goes like this: [It\'s going to get worse in many ways. The forces are
in play\--the rankings, the administrators who want to enhance the reps
of their schools, the status insecurities of young]{.underline} (and
old) [faculty members, the pervasive triumph of porno]{.underline}
(ahem, ahem, told you so) n73[\--all these forces will converge to
produce ever more spam jurisprudence. And then something else will
happen]{.underline}. \<Schlag continues\> In terms of social
organization then, there may be something to be said for creating a
professional corps (lawyers) whose modes of communication are widely
shared and relatively standardized. Notice that if this is the
objective, then the only place where that sort of standardized
communication can be widely shared is somewhere close to the middle of
the bell curve. Both intellectual sloth and intellectual excellence are,
by definition, aberrant and thus detract from our efforts at
standardization. Thus, [training for [mediocrity does serve a social
function]{.mark}]{.underline} (within limits, of course). [Mediocrity is
not the only aim here]{.underline}. [One would like this mediocrity to
be the best it can be]{.underline}. [[We]{.mark}]{.underline} would like
legal professionals [to [share a language and a mode of thought]{.mark}
and]{.underline}, at the same time, [for that language and mode of
thought to be as perspicuous and intelligent as possible]{.underline}.
Given the omnipresence of the bell curve, these desiderata are obviously
in tension. The economists would likely talk about achieving \"the
optimal degree\" of intelligence and mediocrity at the margin, but my
sense is this will only get us so far. For law professors, the tension
is bound to be somewhat frustrating. What many law professors would
like\--because many of them are intellectually inclined\--is to bring
intelligence to bear within legal discourse. This is bound to be a
somewhat frustrating venture. [[Legal discourse is not designed to
produce intelligence and]{.underline}]{.mark}, frankly, [[the]{.mark}
materials and the [discourse can only bear so much]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Good judgment]{.mark}, groundedness, [reasonableness\--any]{.mark} [of
these]{.mark} virtues [is]{.mark} often [enough to snuff out **real
thinking**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, whatever appeal good judgment,
groundedness, and reasonableness may have for a judge or a lawyer (and I
am prepared to say the appeal is considerable), [[such virtues are
not]{.mark} particularly [helpful to **intellectual
achievement**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the contrary, intellectual
achievement requires the abandonment of received understandings. In
fact, I would go so far as to say that **[[intellectual
vitality]{.underline}]{.mark}** (at least in the context of a discipline
like law) \[\*829\] [[requires]{.mark} some degree of
[**defamiliarization**,]{.mark} [some reach for the
exotic]{.mark}]{.underline}. The thing is, [[those]{.mark} sorts of
[efforts are not going to get very far if they]{.mark} constantly [have
to answer to]{.mark} good judgment, [groundedness]{.mark},
reasonableness, [and the like]{.mark}]{.underline}. And at this point, I
would like to flip the argument made earlier in the paper. Here, I would
like us to [[think of]{.mark} [appeals to]{.mark} good judgment,
groundedness, and [reasonableness]{.mark} in legal]{.underline} [thought
[as appeals to mediocrity]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Making people see
things involves things far different from good judgment]{.mark},
[groundedness, or reasonableness]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It
involves]{.mark} a kind of **[artistry]{.mark}**\--[a **reorientation of
the gaze**, a **disruption of complacency**, a **sabotage of habitual
forms of thought**]{.mark}, a **[derailing]{.mark} of [cognitive
defaults]{.mark}**. [This is]{.mark} part of [what **a really good
education is about.** **Constant obeisance**]{.mark} to good judgment or
groundedness or reasonableness, by contrast, [will **systematically
frustrate** such efforts]{.mark}. n57]{.underline} This is all rather
vexing. [[Legal academics]{.underline}]{.mark}\--with aspirations to
intellectual excellence[\--[are]{.mark} thus [destined to]{.mark} [play
out]{.mark} the myth of [Sisyphus]{.mark}. [The main
difference]{.mark}]{.underline}, of course, [[is that **Sisyphus had a
real rock**]{.mark} to push up a real hill]{.underline}. [[The law
professors\']{.mark} rock and hill,]{.underline} by contrast [[are
symbolic]{.underline}]{.mark}\--[imaginative [constructions of their own
making]{.mark}]{.underline}. Arguably, [[pushing a symbolic rock up a
symbolic hill is substantially easier]{.mark} than doing it for real.
[At the very least, it is easier to fake it and to claim
success]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the same time, though, the symbolic
nature of the exercise perhaps makes it more transparently pointless. As
between these two points, there is a certain dissonance. On the one
hand, we are dealing with pushing rocks up hills\--and that is surely
hard work. On the other hand, the rocks and hills are of our own
imagination\--so it should be easy. This is very confusing. n58 My best
guess (and I offer this only as a preliminary hypothesis) is that the
dissonance here might yield a certain degree of neurosis. n59 [Still
[the question pops up again: \"So what]{.mark}?\" So
what\--so]{.underline} [[you have]{.mark} maybe [seven
thousand]{.mark}-something law [professors]{.mark} in the
nation]{.underline} and you know, maybe ninety-six percent are [[engaged
in]{.underline}]{.mark} a kind of [[vaguely neurotic scholarship. So
what]{.mark}?]{.underline} Maybe it\'s borderline tragic. Maybe, these
people could have done so much better. None of this, by the way, is
clearly established. But let\'s just assume, it\'s true. [Who cares?
Seven thousand people\--that\'s not a lot of people.]{.underline} Plus,
it\'s hard to feel for them. I know that nearly all of them would be us
(but still). It\'s an extraordinarily privileged life. So [why care
about this?]{.underline} Here\'s why. The thing about [[legal
scholarship]{.underline}]{.mark} is that it
[[plays]{.underline}]{.mark}\--through the mediation of the professorial
mind\--[[an important role in shaping the ways]{.mark},]{.underline} the
\[\*830\] forms, **[[in which law students think with]{.mark} [and about
law]{.mark}]{.underline}**. n60 [[If they are taught to think in
**essentially mediocre** ways, they]{.mark} will [reproduce
those]{.mark} ways of thinking [as they practice law and
politics]{.mark}]{.underline}. If [they are incurious, [if]{.mark} they
are [lacking in political]{.mark} and legal [imagination]{.mark}, if
they are [simply repeating]{.mark} the [standard
moves]{.mark}]{.underline} (even if with impressive virtuosity) [[they
will]{.mark}, as a group, be [wield]{.mark}ing [power in]{.mark}
essentially [mediocre ways]{.mark}]{.underline}. And the thing is:
**[[when mediocrity is endowed with power, it yields violence.]{.mark}
And [when]{.mark} mediocrity is [endowed with great power]{.mark}, it
yields [massive violence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. n61 All of which is to
say that in making the negotiation between the imprinting of standard
forms of legal thought and the imparting of an imaginative intelligence,
we err too much on the side of the former. (Purely my subjective call
here\--but so is everybody else\'s.) Another way to put it is that while
there is something to be said for the standardization point made
earlier, generally, standardization is overdone. n62

### 2AC\-\--AT: Antiblackness

#### Blackness has become datafied and only the aff can prevent a new planter class from emerging -- otherwise they ensure a new omnipresent racial-colonial hierarchy

[Humanity's nervous system has adopted into itself synchronised patterns
of behaviour that rhythmically conform to highly modulated
electromagnetic frequencies. These conjoined phenomena contribute to a
heavily assayed atmosphere, where 'wearables and the movements of
capital steadily converge along with ever**-widening circuits of
extraction and expressivity'** (Seigworth 24). Here]{.underline} it
becomes of paramount concern to discern whether the information being
received portends 'promise or threat' (24). [What humans regard as their
world is now made both substantial through interaction, and valuable
through an immaterial architecture of discernment which draws upon the
**ubiquity of consciousness as a natural resource**, that can
artificially refine down to the granular level of apprehension and thus
**seized upon as data**]{.underline}. At a meta-level, the planet itself
is being primed to contribute to ongoing processes of soliciting and
securing its own patterns of extrusion. The skin of the world and the
skin of the body act as conduits for the premutation of entry and
retrieval. The Anthropocene looms over these surfaces as a posthuman
assemblage capable of redirecting complex modes of entrainment that can
no longer be classed as essentially biotic. The world to come is one
teeming with a multiplicity of animistic awareness, and therefore its
energies cannot be exhausted by the limitations of humanoid language and
human intelligence.

A seemingly depleted environment can now be imbued with unbounded
nonhuman vitality such that the digital marketplace will eventually
cease to rely solely on human capacities for perception to produce their
grounds for advancement. [The Earth's engineered milieu, then becomes a
territory of extended cognition, through the **colonial imposition** of
a range of digitally enhanced concepts and points of view that **dilute
humanity's powers of imagination**. These entities need not be highly
intelligent themselves, but simply capable of drawing an account of
their aliveness and intention to act as agents for the progress of this
situation. This allows data to evolve organically as an active entity
replete with its own history, traits, behaviour, and
personality]{.underline}. Their patterns of accrual has nothing whatever
to do the formal texture of life. It is for the very reason that they
become favoured modes of survival on a dying planet necessarily
requiring of its subjects that they be post-cognitive, post-user and
post-human in their intelligent design strategy, throwing off the
previous constraint of having to consume responsibly and adopting its
place a new condition of obligation to extort critically within the
context of human and nonhuman digital cohabitation. If posthuman is a
term that connotes the upper limits of humanity as a construct, what
must necessarily reside beneath is a less than a human which remains
subject to extractive labour, beholden to the privatisation of property
and artificially tethered.

[The posthuman represents yet another iteration of (**white) racial**,
historical and geographic appropriation in the sense that postdigital
imperialism does not reciprocate rights of ownership when it comes to
its plotting of the virtual world in terms of property, enclosure,
measure, or meaning. Its project to generate a global configuration of
knowledge, marked by its **omnipresent coloniality** by maintaining an
intimate form of connectivity with the structures of colonial and
plantation societies that previously positioned the category of humanity
as an **enlightened figure of representation cast against the shadow
bodies of transatlantic slavery and indigenous dispossession**. The
viable behaviours of nonhuman life and their related ecologies became,
in turn, the raw material of the property of which he was to
govern]{.underline}. The posthuman in many ways extends that contract to
include sentience and the deadening thereof.

Arthur Kroker anticipates a future where [the human sensorium will be
digitally outsourced and that such evacuation consciousnessious will
result in 'generalized feelings of boredom mixed with random acts of
terror and panicked attempts by leaders to put back together what can
never really be reassembled -- the technologically shattered remains of
lives, economies, politics and policies in the aftermath of the digital
blast' (191). These conditions leave humanity stranded at the limits of
digital mobility and forced to dwell within an **oscillating reality of
terror and boredom, zeros and ones**]{.underline}. Humanity has yet to
become the stuff of technopoesis, but even now it is clear that certain
bodies won't matter enough to warrant the transition. Kroker argues that
[where humanity stands now nothing has prepared it 'to live out a deeply
consequential future prefigured by the spectre of drones, algorithms,
image vectors, distributive consciousness, artificial intelligence,
neurological implants, and humanoid robotics' (21).]{.underline} What it
is preparing for is an otherwise disconnection requiring of our mass
re-assignation of meaning toward a future of deadened affect. What is
enlivened in its place are image streams and data feeds, which prepare
themselves to survive culture if need be. Our demise comes to us
increasingly by way of accident, rather than incident, as there is no
human agency left to point to in rendering our reality as the engrossed
causalities of a technologically augmented capitalism.

[**Blackness itself may be read here** as the basis it which it becomes
possible to assume that life can be collectively constrained to act in
ways conferring distinction by **perpetuating an unequal property
order** in which humanity is ranked according to the ability of the
individual body to assimilate property in-one-self]{.underline}.
Property itself assumes consciousness in this century by seeming to
afford the individual access to a great assemblage of power in which it
becomes possible not only to be self-made but equally self-possessing
within the parameters of an algorithmic estate that was purpose-built to
expand, augment, atomise, and level the governance of human life. [This
occurs in a world dominated by a **new planter class** eager to
cultivate the cognitive labour of othering human beings and determined
to extract value from immaterial cerebral and relational activities from
within the already occupied minds of human beings,]{.underline} as well
as their artificial counterparts whose intelligence is classed as virgin
territory, and therefore, exempt from prior claims of ownership.

Such a system relies on differential valuation and the assignment of
materiality to consciousness and value to an ever-widening province of
contact and exchange developed along a continuum of novel distinctions
in kind. [As a form of discipline, such sorting relies on the **merger
of race with any number of possible subject positions** that can
moderate habits of perception, and modes of embodiment that confer with
the administration of cognitive capitalism and technological
determinism]{.underline}. Jefferson's narrative of [slave apprehension
and expulsion prefigures here the necessity of surveillance to ensure
the maintenance of valorised life as **synonymous** with capital gain
and that escape is prevented escape by plotting consent as muting force
extends its unspeakable power to the ends of the earth; this time
without sociobiological qualification. The **datafication of blackness
or whiteness is no longer strictly reducible to personhood** but now
grows outward to encompass specific sympathies and inform both doubt in
and affirmation of the whiteness of planetary intelligence. It also
represents a future enclosure of humanity within a technological order
on premised on the ongoing defence and legitimation of calculable
deprivation and precarious inhabitation wearing heavily on the fabric of
meaning.]{.underline}

#### The will to technology explains whiteness better and is the root cause of the world plantation

Everything that the wearer experiences and conveys is thusly made
available to its enslaved sensor who freely refines that material into
the stuff of further dependency and then moves it onwards into a greater
commercial channel of mass amplification. [Through the ubiquity of these
**technologies**, it is possible to conceive of the world itself as a
**vast plantation** where fugitive thought, expression and movement of
one sort, or another within the algorithmic estate can be restrained and
recaptured, in instances where it cannot be initially deterred. The
development of the Internet of Things is systematically contingent on
the **existence of a central master**, which coordinates the
communications between slave devices and the Internet. Here **whiteness
is 'metaphorically represented by technology'**]{.underline}
(Chude-Sokei 89).

This metaphor, Louis Chude-Sokei argues, can only succeed through the
presumption that [slavery is synonymous with blackness, the Negro slave
is construed as a '"**device**"' and the machine standing in for the
white master is '**potentially "autonomous**"' in carrying out its
orders]{.underline} (90).

Notes on the State Intrusion

[This metaphor dates back to the very origins of industrialisation in
America. The predominance of agrarianism within the South is challenged
by the rise of industrialisation in the North. There is much concern
expressed amongst the Southern planter class about how to restrain its
rampant progress. As industrialisation continues its advancement, it is
increasingly coupled with 'an image of planetary destruction' (90). Such
anxieties are **twinned with race** from the very beginning of the
American experiment]{.underline}. When one of the founders of its
republican project, Thomas Jefferson, paints a troubling picture of
machinic intrusion into the virgin territory of Virginia, he is also
tacitly referring to slave intrusion. In his narrative Notes on the
State of Virginia, Jefferson projects their intersection would hasten
'the extinction of one race by the other' (92). [What White Americans,
like Jefferson fear most is their subordination to technology. This is
the case, because they have already manufactured race as the instituting
technology of their New World style of imperialism. The potential for
slave rebellion lies at the centre of obedience to that same system,
which must subdue nature, as well as **blackness**, as an extension of
the nation's founding logic of territorial conquest.]{.underline}

It was widely believed that Southern plantations would eventually become
the settings of a full-scale race war. Jefferson's solution to the
looming spectre of a slave rebellion on America's burgeoning plantations
was the immediate liberation and colonial resettlement of American
slaves into parts of Africa that would serve the parallel function of
extending America's planetary territorial domain. In 1816, Jefferson's
fellow Virginia liberal slaveholders established the American
Colonization Society. It is built on ideas articulated by Jefferson, who
acts 'as a "founding father" of colonisation' through ['his advocacy of
a massive, centralised, state-sponsored scheme to enumerate, deport, and
resettle African Americans in Africa, and then to **surveil and control
that resettlement** after deportation' (Kazanjian 42).]{.underline} His
fervour for African colonisation was matched by his desire to import
'white laborers' which he interchangeably refers to as 'Germans', making
these respective populations, units subjectable to geographical
manipulation. What will, in time, be held up as Jeffersonian democracy
[defines what is held up to be '"American freedom" through a distinctly
modern, **calculable logic of racial governmentality'** (42). The
American liberal doctrine that Jefferson promotes in his role as founder
of this institutional body is entirely consistent with a long-standing
project of European colonisation.]{.underline}

#### Pem do the aff through the lens of the alt -- only thinking through affect AND blackness allows for generative thought around black capacity

**Ashley and Billies 19** (Colin Patrick Ashley and Michelle Billies,
CUNY Graduate Center, CUNY Kingsborough Community College,  3-27-2019,
CUNY, \"Affect & Race/(Blackness) \",

[For Wilderson]{.underline}, for Hartman, for Fanon, for Aimé
Cesaire---[the possibility of black liberation means that the world must
be destroyed]{.underline} and at the center of that destruction is the
human. (See Ball, 2014, interview with Wilderson.) This is why
[theorists concerned with questions of liberation can no longer engage
in materialisms]{.underline} that assume the exploitation of the human
but refuse to engage in the ontological question of what the human is.
It is telling that [within black studies those beings that enter the
world produced through blackness as black beings, black objects, black
capacities are increasingly at the heart of breaking down the
ontological assumptions of the status of the human]{.underline}. The
post-human nature of affect theory is at a great loss if it doesn't
consider the question of blackness as it relates to the idea of the
human---especially if blackness is itself 'pre-human.' Clough and Wilse
(2010) reminds us that "future governance will continue to engage
methods of manipulating affective potential" (p. 60). Likewise[, Harney
and Moten's work on debt and governance is a political directive to take
seriously this affective capacity of blackness. **Taking affective
blackness seriously questions the idea of 'affect and race'**, modeling
a focus on specific racial productions and capacities for their singular
(complex, proliferating, historical, future-oriented)
capacities]{.underline}. [The distinct ways in which blackness has been
used to shape philosophies of the human is just one devastating outcome
of its capacity toward death that has played a fundamental role in
Western thought and world formation]{.underline}. [Thinking through
blackness and capacity **allows for generative thought around black
capacity**]{.underline}---[what black bodies or black space or black
populations do---more specifically what blackness
produces]{.underline}---**[without being stuck in the quagmire of binary
structuring that is the space of essentialism vs constructionism and
identity vs structure]{.underline}**. This also actually [allows us to
fully embrace some of the ontological assumptions of affect theory and
therefore becomes the direction in which we believe that a field of
affect ultimately needs to head]{.underline}, in order to account for
its own theoretical history, [acknowledge how it has either shunned
blackness in its desire for universality and distance from human
subjects, or gotten trapped by thinking blackness, race, and ethnicity
are primarily about human interaction]{.underline}, in order to
participate in maximizing the potential for understanding blackness, as
well as any other specific racial and ethnic formation for their
affective capacities. And, if the response to this piece is "Why
blackness and not \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (insert other "race")" this is the
point of our piece, part of our critique of the utilization of race, and
why we find value in affect theory.

#### Thinking blackness through ontology and structural antagonism traps blackness the prison of history, thereby negating the potential of becoming to escape the exclusionary and violent machinations of history. Beginning with structural antagonism and ontology constrains the subject in a calculable grid; against this predetermined structuralism we must assert a strategy of becoming minoritarian.

Jackson" *Genre*, Vol. 44, No. 2 Summer 2011 DOI
10.1215/00166928-1260183/

In "The Case of Blackness" Moten (2008b: 187) perceptively remarks,
"[[What is inadequate to blackness is already given
ontologies]{.underline}]{.mark}." What if we were [[to think of
blackness as a name for an ontology of becoming]{.underline}]{.mark}?
How [[might]{.underline}]{.mark} such a thinking [[transform our
understanding of the relation of blackness to history and its specific
capacity to "think \[its\] way out of the exclusionary constructions" of
history]{.underline}]{.mark} and the thinking of history (Moten 2008a:
1744)? [[Existing ontologies tend to reduce blackness to a historical
condition]{.mark},]{.underline} [a "lived experience," [and]{.mark} in
doing so [effectively eradicate its unruly character]{.mark} as a
transformative force.]{.underline} [Deleuze and Guattari]{.underline}, I
think, offer a compelling way to [think]{.underline} of [this
unruliness]{.underline} when they write, "[[What History grasps of the
event is]{.underline}]{.mark} its effectuation in states of affairs or
in [[lived experience, but the event in its becoming]{.mark}, in its
specific consistency]{.underline}, in its self- positing as concept,
[[escapes History"]{.underline}]{.mark} (Deleuze and Guattari 1994:
110). [[To bring this relation]{.mark} between blackness and
becoming]{.underline} further into the open [--- [toward an
affirmation]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of the
unexpected]{.underline}]{.mark} insinuation of blackness signaled by the
use of Jackson's line as an "[event in its becoming]{.underline}" --- a
few more words need be said about Deleuze's method. The use of Jackson's
writing is just one instance of a procedure that we find repeated
throughout Capitalism and Schizophrenia, where [we constantly encounter
unexpected injections of]{.underline} quotations, names, and
[ideas]{.underline} lifted from other texts, [lines that appear all of
sudden as though propelled by their own force.]{.underline} One might
say they are deployed rather than explained or interpreted; as such,
they produce textual events that readers may choose to ignore or pick up
and run with. [Many names]{.underline} are proposed for this method ---
"[schizoanalysis]{.underline}, [micropolitics]{.underline},
[pragmatics]{.underline}, diagrammatism, [rhizomatics]{.underline},
[cartography]{.underline}" (Deleuze and Parnet \[1977\] 2006: 94) ---
[but [the crucial issue is to affirm an experimental practice that
opposes itself to the interpretation]{.mark}]{.underline} of texts,
[[proposing instead that we think of]{.underline}]{.mark} a book as "a
little machine" and ask "[[what it functions with]{.underline}]{.mark},
in connection with what other things does it [[or does it not transmit
intensities?"]{.underline}]{.mark} (Deleuze and Guattari \[1980\] 1987:
4).8 Studying how Soledad Brother functions in Deleuze's books,
connecting Jackson's line to questions and historical issues that are
not always explicitly addressed in those books, involves one in this
action. And further, it opens new lines where the intensities
transmitted in Jackson's book make a claim on our own practice. [This
method can be seen as an effort to disrupt the hierarchical opposition
between theory and practice]{.underline} and to challenge some of the
major assumptions of Western Marxism. In an interview with Antonio Negri
in the 1990s, Deleuze (1997: 171) clarifies that he and Guattari have
"remained Marxists" in their concern [[to analyze the ways capitalism
has developed]{.underline}]{.mark} but that their political philosophy
[[makes three crucial distinctions with]{.underline}]{.mark} respect to
more [[traditional theoretical approaches]{.underline}]{.mark}: first, a
thinking of "war machines" as opposed to state theory; second, [[a
"consideration of minorities rather than classes"]{.underline}]{.mark};
and finally, [[the study of social "lines of flight" rather than]{.mark}
the [interpretation]{.mark} and critique of social
contradictions]{.underline}. Each of these distinctions, as we will see,
resonates with Jackson's political philosophy, but as the passage from
Anti-Oedipus demonstrates, the concept of [the "line of flight" emerges
directly in connection]{.underline} to Deleuze and Guattari's encounter
[with Soledad Brother]{.underline}. [[The concept affirms those social
constructions that would neither be determined by preexisting structures
nor caught in a dialectical contradiction. It names a force that is
radically autonomous from existing ontologies, structures, and
historical accounts]{.underline}.]{.mark} [It is]{.underline} above all
[for this reason]{.underline} that [D]{.underline}eleuze [and
G]{.underline}uattari [insist that [society be thought of not as a
"structure" but as a "machine,"]{.mark}]{.underline} [[because such a
concept enables the thinking of]{.mark} the [movements]{.mark},
energies, [and intensities]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e., [the lines of
flight) [that such machines transmit. The thinking]{.mark} of machines
[forces us not only to consider]{.mark} the social and historical [labor
involved in producing society but also]{.mark} the [ongoing potentials
of constructing new]{.mark} types of [assemblages]{.mark}]{.underline}
(agencement). [[One of the key adversaries]{.mark} of this machinic
approach [is]{.mark}]{.underline} "interpretation" and more specifically
[[structuralist interpretations of society in terms of
contradictions]{.underline}.]{.mark} According to Deleuze and Guattari
(\[1980\] 1987: 293), [[structuralism]{.mark} persisted in the
"submission of the line to the point" and as a result [produced a theory
of subjectivity, and]{.mark} also [an account of language and]{.mark}
the [unconscious, that could not think in terms of movement and
construction]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[Defining lines only in
relation to finite points]{.underline}]{.mark} (the subject, the
signifier) [[produces a calculable grid]{.mark},]{.underline} a
structure that then appears as the hidden intelligibility of the system
and of society generally. Louis Althusser's account of the "ideological
State apparatus" as the [[determining structure]{.mark} of
subjectivity]{.underline} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} perhaps [[the
extreme]{.underline}]{.mark} expression of this [[gridlocked
position]{.underline}]{.mark} (an example we will come back to in a
later section). [Opposed to this theoretical approach,
[diagrammatism]{.mark}]{.underline} (to invoke one of the terms given
for this method) [[maps vectors that generate an open space]{.mark} and
the potentials]{.underline} for giving consistency to the latter.9 In
other words, [[rather than tracing the hidden structures of an
intolerable system]{.mark}, D]{.underline}eleuze [and
G]{.underline}uattari['s method aims [to map the ways out of
it.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### This also accesses a Ressentiment DA because the reactive definition of blackness to a merely opposable term destroys the possibility of freedom and the active creation of value.

Physiologically speaking, [it requires [an outside stimulus in order to
act at all; all action is reaction]{.mark}]{.underline}\" (Nietzsche,
The Birth, 170-171). [[The slave blames the other,]{.mark} or outsider,
[for his suffering, makes]{.mark} him or her the symbol of evil and [a
phobic object]{.mark}]{.underline}. This response remains reactive.
[[The slave does not act on the basis of]{.mark} his or [her
sovereignty, but in opposition to]{.mark} the other\'s
[domination]{.mark}.]{.underline} Nietzsche argues that [[ressentiment
indicates a failure]{.underline}]{.mark}, not so much to accept
responsibility for one\'s existence (Sartrean \"bad faith\"), but a
failure [[to **affirm life as a spirit of becoming**]{.underline}.
[Fanon terms it a]{.underline}]{.mark} [slavish, [**reactive attitude**
toward the **future and the past**.]{.mark} In this \"pessimism of
indignation\" [one assumes that one can do nothing because one is
wretched, and one blames someone else for one\'s wretchedness. This is
why,]{.mark}]{.underline} in Wretched of tlte Earth, Fanon argues that
[[the first stages of spontaneous anticolonial violence are always
reactive:]{.underline} [\"racism, hatred,
resentment,\"]{.underline}]{.mark} [\"the legitimate desire for
vengeance,\" [cannot sustain a war of liberation.]{.mark}]{.underline}
14 Such reactive moments are linked to questions of time but in a
negative sense, as examples of a reactive affirmation of history. It is
precisely because he recognizes racist historicity in these attitudes
that Fanon\'s work is taken up with the problem of time and death. [If
the limit set to black life is the significance conferred on presence by
racism which voids all black life of value as life, with the result that
one cannot live it, racism also robs the black of his or her ability to
live and so to die as a free subject]{.underline}. Spurned by history,
[the [attempts]{.mark} by blacks [to reimmerse]{.mark} themselves [in
time have resulted in]{.mark} a turn toward [allegory and
myth]{.mark}]{.underline}. [These attempts]{.underline} are condemned
because they [restrict the life as lived to one held in abeyance, in
suspension, [a life ossified]{.mark} either [by its]{.mark} slavish
[reverence for the precolonial past or by its abject sacrificing of
itself to the future to come]{.mark}]{.underline}, the freedom always to
come in eternity. [Both attitudes are positings of finite being that
refuse to tarry with death as the true scandal of black historical
experience and so become even less capable of resolving]{.underline}
[it]{.underline}. This is not to say that Fanon has lost faith in a
redemptive future, or that he wants to routinize and categorize such
temporal ecstasies by representing death as life\'s categorical
commandment. Rather that, as in the letter to Tayeb, [what matters is
the life earned when it plunges into the inexplicable and emerges from
it]{.underline}; what matters is [how we]{.underline}, like Orpheus,
[take up the cunning and creativity of ressentiment as a culture on the
edge of nothingness]{.underline}. Only [[by negotiating power and
violence can we engage and reconfigure virtue for the modem
polity]{.mark}]{.underline} (the \"new humanism\" that emerges from the
\"tabula rasa\" [[open]{.mark}ed [up]{.mark} by]{.underline} the
colonized on [[the path toward revolution]{.underline}]{.mark}-a
possibility which is [neither an end nor a beginning but an endless
\"tension of opening]{.underline}\" between the twO).IS That is, [[death
as lawless violence is the]{.mark} predicament and [possibility of who
we are and might become,]{.mark}]{.underline} here, now, the tenses
through which we belong irreducibly to this time. This is also why Fanon
rejects Sartrean, Hegelian, and other forms of determinate historicism,
the logic according to which everything that happens had to happen.
Against dialectical logic -- and its view that out of experience, no
matter how negative. something emerges -- Fanon posits a black
existential time in which what happened happens and keeps on happening
in ways that remain unforeseeable and unknowable but which nonetheless
forces us to be responsible at the level of ethics, politics, and will.
Throughout Fanon\'s oeuvre. [antihistoricism turns on the difficulty of
naming and situating a black orphism beyond identity and alterity,
beyond loss and the annihilation of being. True anticolonial violence,
if it is to go beyond such Manichacism,]{.underline} [must arrive at a
teleological suspension of the ethical]{.underline} and so go beyond the
spurious opposition between murder and illegitimate right, or murder
dressed up as political vengeance. [Manichean violence is ressentiment,
for liberation is not a higher ethical law than murder and can only be
justified in the pursuit of freedom, which is incommensurable with
domination but nevertheless implicated in its violence.]{.underline}
Hence Fanon is not trying to ethically justify the violence of
anticolonial war (as he is often accused of doing). but trying to
account for the use of violence in the revolutionary pursuit of
freedom.\" Liberatory violence. in brief. as one possible memory of the
future; as one possible pathway through the unjust violences of the
political world. Both the conclusions to Black Skill, While Masks and
Wretched of t/-ie Earlh define that memory as thc horizon of
revolutionary hope and politics. as a rupture of time without end but
within time\'s workings. POl\' this reason, I cannot accept Patrick
Taylor\'s dircrnpuvc opposition between Black Skill, While Masks as a
work that ends with ethics over history. and Wretched of the Earth as a
work that moves from ethics to revolutionary history (Taylor.
Narratives, 74-76). Such opposition misreads the conclusion to Black
Skill, White Mllsks. where [Fanon writes, \"I am not the slave of the
Slavery that dehumanized my ancestors]{.underline}\" (230). [Antillean
culture is a slave culture]{.underline} for Fanon, [following Nietzsche,
because its ressentiment represents a cultural-historico paralysis which
has not yet become creative and so achieve that active forgetfulness of
the past that accompanies successful repression and defines a noble
memory of the will.]{.underline} This peculiar anamnesis, which is the
result of historically distinct configurations of power, dominarion. and
race war, reveals how, for Fanon, the traumas of cultural assimilation
for the colonial subject is already marked by historical forces and
decisive events whose trauma cannot simply be dispelled by the time of
analysis or the methods of genealogy. 17 [Slave ethics, insofar as it is
reactive and denies responsibility and its ability to act, cannot
achieve this cultural-historico transmutation. Through decolonization
and violence the colonized can break through the impasse of ressentiment
and enter into history. The task for the colonized]{.underline}, Fanon
implies, [is to risk the orphic \"leap\" into the \"black hole\" while
also moving Out to the universal]{.underline} (199). One must move
beyond the \"absurd drama\" of colonialism dialectically. [One must move
to ethics from history because ethics is the affirmation of the radical
transformation of time, a decision to change both the meaning of the
deathliness of black life and its sign of ressentiment.]{.underline} In
the essay \"West Indians and Africans,\" Fanon writes, \'The task
consists of removing the problem, puuing the contingent in its place,
and leaving the Martinican the choice of supreme values. One sees
everything that could be said by envisaging this situation in accordance
with the Kierkegaardian stages. \"18 These stages arc the aesthetic, the
ethical and the religious, Fanon\'s turn to Kierkegaard is not, as
Patrick Taylor presents it, [a move from ethics to history or, more
accurately, inner morality to objective or ethical freedom]{.underline}.
but a recognition of how violence and law pervade each other, and of how
[ethics is an encounter with the violence of power and its legitimation.
**[The task is to move]{.mark}, not from values based on race [to human
values understood as transcending the old humanisms of Europe]{.mark},
which formed the foundations of colonial racism, but [to address the
phantasmatic and racist underpinnings of value as
such]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Fanon explicitly mentions Kierkegaard when
discussing how law and violence remain implicated in the movement from
ethics to freedom in history. The slave\'s struggle for freedom cannot
only be defined in ethical terms. On the other hand, it is naive to
assume that the decolonial world will exist beyond law and coercion. In
Black Skin, W!tiLe Masks Fanon writes, \"The former slave, who can find
in his memory no trace of the struggle for liberty or of that anguish of
liberty of which Kierkegaard speaks, sits unmoved before the young white
man singing and dancing on the tightrope of existence\" (22t). Because
the slave has no memory of that \"anguish of liberty,\" the ethical and
the historical condition of freedom remains unavowable. The slave
remains a dumb wimess to his own violated singularity which he can
neither comprehend, renounce nor test. Fanon says that \"[[the real leap
consists in **introducing invention into
existence**]{.mark}\"]{.underline} (229). [[One shows how the ethical is
mediated by the promise and actuality of such \"invention\" by
**becoming actively creative at the level of
history**]{.underline}.]{.mark} [Acceptance of this coexistence does not
\"eliminate \... the ethical in oneself,\" but forces one to return to
the ethical as the always potential encounter with the violence of the
world as a test of one\'s faith]{.underline} (Taylor, Narmtives, 76).

### 2AC\-\--AT: Baudrillard

#### Baudrillard was [wrong]{.underline} -- it's no longer [Disneyland]{.underline}, it's [Robotland]{.underline}

**Kroker** and Kroker **21** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and
adjunct professor of political science at the University of Victoria,
Marilouise Kroker - feminist scholar, publisher, editor, writer,
theorist, and performance artist, "Technologies of the New Real",
University of Toronto Press, Pages 132-134, October 2021, MG)

[While Jean Baudrillard might once have noted that the seduction of
Disneyland is its convincing pretence that its fantastic simulations are
an escape from the real world rather than what Disneyland really
is]{.underline} -- a perfect model of the real-time model of soft power,
modulated violence, and crowd management -- [**Robot Land was to be the
technological rider after the age of simulacra**. Here, there would be
technologically enabled thrills -- roller coasters dangling from the
outstretched arms of massive robots -- mesmerizing robotic spectacles,
and spectacular feats of imagination, but **no order of simulacra**, no
sense that the new order of robotics is anything than what it really is:
a key component of the Korean version of the power of the new
real]{.underline}. With its mixture of entertainment spectacles,
industrial promotions, and a graduate school in robotics[, Robot Land
was to be a place where fun illusions and delirious spectacles would
always be underwritten by a **very visible undercurrent of dead-eyed
economic seriousness** of purpose and **carefully orchestrated research
visions of (certain) robotic futures**. This notion of place is, of
course, the proposed theme park's biggest problem: the future of
robotics will probably have nothing to do with any territorial referent;
certainly, it will not be a "land" in any physical or even symbolic
meaning of the term but will most definitely constitute a new order of
time -- robotic time. In this case, Robot Time, rather than Robot Land,
would probably be a more accurate description of the new epoch ushered
in by all futurist robotic designs, from mass entertainment spectacles
to the complex artificial sensors working the assembly lines of the
manufacturing world. When **the future of robotics**, one **already
anticipated by contemporary developments**, turns away from its
ready-to-hand terrestrial manifestations -- artificial fish,
mega-statues, humanoid machines -- and enters the databases of
globalized networked culture as their indispensable artificial
intelligence and machine-to-machine and machine-to-human communication,
then we will recognize that we are not following a **technological
pathway that will lead to a certain place (Robot Land)** but one that
will lead towards a certain (robotic) order of database time that is
networked, communicative, and neutral]{.underline}. As with all things
having to do with theme parks, actually expressing such a fundamental
eschatological rupture in the order of things -- the displacement in
importance of visible space by the invisibilities of (database) time --
is challenging. Such a challenge is probably why, although it takes
momentary refuge in the comfortable referential illusion of Robot Land,
[this proposed theme park is one that will probably always be known for
the hauntological traces of its essential missing element -- the once
and future epoch of Database Robot Time. There are definitely **no
"magical kingdoms," no "fairy-tale princesses," no "pirates" -- just a
proposed theme park on the edge of the rising time of the
Eas**t]{.underline}, which announces that, for all the psychic
exuberance of its robotic fossils, from fish and statues to carousel
animals, it is one Tomorrowland that will not be able to camouflage for
much longer what is really taking place in this second invasion of
Incheon: the newly emergent order of the time of the robots, with humans
kept on standby as their necessary prosthetics. [Now that the original
vision of I, Robot Land has been discarded, we may never have an answer
to the question concerning the time of robots, but we definitely know
that, in the future as in the present, design based on speculative
fiction is still at the mercy of real historical time with its rise and
fall of both human and robotic imaginaries.]{.underline}

#### Even if they win Baudrillard was right, only the aff can solve -- everything is now encoded and programmed, coopted by technology

**Kroker 14** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct professor
of political science at the University of Victoria, "Exits to the
Posthuman Future" , Polity Press, Pages 72-73, 2014, MG)

[Certainly, in the present circumstance, **Jean Baudrillard was
correct**]{.underline}. Like all the great referential signs before it
-- power, consciousness, desire, sex, money -- [history now also begins
to follow a reverse movement, instantly repolarizing, energizing itself
by a fatal, interminable exhumation of the past. Which is probably why
everything now appears to operate under the historical injunction that
the past must be **exposed, deciphered, coded, programmed** -- endless
histories of war, chilling histories of ethnic massacres, media exposés
of the rise and fall of celebrities, histories transmitted by mass
media, histories written in the language of cinematography, histories
that are mobile, cellular]{.underline}, networked. Of course, with each
repeated media exposure, historical events grow successively colder,
further removed from the temporality of human passion, more distanced
from immediate emotional response the closer they are to the eye of
digital perception. [When historical narratives disappear into the image
simulacrum, when history is literally captured by the speed of the
information machine, what remains is an imploding field of fractured
debris, fully exposed, imaged, and narrated, but, for all that,
ultimately unknowable as to its ultimate purposes.]{.underline}

[Like all other sign-forms, history has probably always yearned to
escape its heavy referential destiny, to finally decouple itself from
the language of social signification and the epistemological
responsibility of hermeneutic interpretation in favor of something else,
history as a radical paroxysm of future events, never really knowable in
advance nor understandable in the past tense precisely because **history
has now mutated into a recombinant sign** -- complex, mediated,
bifurcated, fractured, multiple, and contradictory]{.underline}. In this
case, the precession of history stipulates that there can no longer be
any definitive end of history because the question of the end has itself
become something enigmatic: temporally enigmatic since with light-time
ends are often beginnings; and spatially enigmatic since with
light-space ends are matters of pure artifice. Or perhaps something more
perverse -- [that fascination with the end of history functions as a
psychological displacement of anxiety about the impossibility of framing
the question of history itself.]{.underline} Consequently, historical
archives everywhere, memories recorded, stories decoded, past events
patiently exhumed, premonitory signs of the future anxiously
interpreted, museums of history reanimated -- all this because real time
may move too quickly for traditional historical interpretation, just as
light-space throws the object of history into a gathering darkness.

Mythic nemesis has its implacable rules that will not be violated by
even the most cosmically daring of all the species. [If the human
species allied itself in the past with pagan spirits, and perhaps now
seeks to usurp the gods by **taking control of the technical direction
of human destiny** -- condensing the necessarily variegated nature of
time into the degree-zero of real time and accelerating space itself
into light-space moving at the speed of electrons -- the fates will not
long be silenced]{.underline}. This may explain the mysterious
association between the multiple ends of history and sacrificial
violence. If the ends of history would seek to exceed the transcendent
dreams of the supernatural, overcome the limits of the physical, and
vivisect the realm of the biotic, then this gift of the posthuman must
certainly be repaid with a completion of the cycle of sacrificial
violence. But how to complete the cycle of sacrificial expiation when
the new, self-proclaimed creator of the history of the posthuman is
itself the human species? [What sacrifice would equal the unanswerable
gift of a species that would seek to recreate the metaphysical order of
time and space itself? In this case, will the extinction of the human
species as presently understood prove to be the **sacrificial price to
be paid for the technological gift** of genomic engineering or of those
intense efforts to blast neutrons free from their entombment in
elementary matter?]{.underline} Certainly, ominous signs of human
species extinction are pervasive: apocalyptic scenarios of climate
change, desultory images of leaking radiation, the physical exhaustion
of fish, animals, plants, and even of the traditional cycle of
climatology itself. [It is as if the four humors -- earth, sky, fire,
and water -- stand silent watch over the sudden emergence, with
brilliant kinetic energy, of the human species and its sudden
disappearance into delirious designs of its own making.]{.underline}

#### The world isn't simulation it's virtualization -- only by disrupting the will to technology can you solve both the aff and their K

of political science at the University of Victoria, "THE WILL TO
TECHNOLOGY AND THE CULTURE OF NIHILISM: HEIDEGGER, NIETZSCHE, AND MARX",

And why not? [It's the **age of the streamed body,** the data
body.]{.underline}

[The body has always been the site of the most radical political, indeed
eschatological, struggle -- the decisive site for the inscription in
**flesh of power as its speaks the body** future.]{.underline}

[The data body is the recombinant body: cloned by the biotech industry,
spliced by artificial skin, digital nerves, and networked intelligence,
resequenced by the liquid signs of brand-name consumer]{.underline}
[advertising]{.underline}. Simultaneously the targeted axis of the
interfacing of digital reality and biotechnology and [the **site of
future political struggle where flesh rubs against the will to
virtuality**, the data body is, for better and for worse, the spearhead
of techno-culture.]{.underline}

[In the age of Christianity, the body was]{.underline}
[virtualized]{.underline}, split into warring bodies of flesh and grace,
with the corporeal body undergoing almost two millennia of dogmatic
purification, with fire, with the rack, with pincers, with the rope. [In
the age of capitalism, the body was commodified, sometimes colonized as
exchange-value]{.underline}, invested by all the signs of advertising
culture in that fateful transition of capitalism from the commodity-form
to the sign-form, [vivisected by a fourfold strategy of domination,
**from alienation (Marx) and reification (Lukács) to simulation
(Baudrillard) and now virtualization**. In the age of technology, the
so-called autonomous body, this always doubled body of flesh and grace
and use-value and exchange-value, shatters into a thousand digital
mirrors. The data body. The android body. The mutant body. The designer
body. The cloner body. The transsexual body. Digital flesh loop-cycling
furiously within the limited space and time of a single (biological)
life cycle: indeterminate, neutralized, floating. **The data body itself
as the new media future**.]{.underline}

With or without our consent or public discussion, [the digital future
leaps beyond the old forms of twentieth-century politics, finance,
culture, and society to create an unpredictable future in which the
programmer, the engineer, the eugenicist, the multinational multimedia
czar install the ruling codes of the digital eye.]{.underline}

[What is the future of digital reality]{.underline}? What is the
consequence of the fateful meeting of digital experience and biotech
engineering? What is the fate of the future itself when, as Paul Virilio
argues in Open Sky, [time and space as the deep horizon of our existence
**have been accidented**, have been radically derealized, into the
dimensionless void of 'space-light' and the real time, the
instantaneous, global networked time of light-time? After the mutation,
the galactic debris of local time and local space gets in our eyes, and
history as a chronological succession of events collapses into random
events with mutable meanings. Or when reality suddenly flips, and we
**are no longer living in hyper-reality**, broken boundaries moving at
the speed of light, but just the opposite -- **reversed into a digital
universe** moving at the slow speed of light.]{.underline}

### 2AC\-\--AT: Capitalism

#### Trying to overcome capital outside of the cybernetic sphere is rooted in the language of technicity and the will to technology -- either the alt fails or the perm solves

**Kroker 4** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct professor
of political science at the University of Victoria, "THE WILL TO
TECHNOLOGY AND THE CULTURE OF NIHILISM: HEIDEGGER, NIETZSCHE, AND MARX",
University of Toronto Press, Pages 145-147, March 2004, MG)

[For Capital, it's bitter irony. The emergence of the will to virtuality
out of the economic disguise of the circuit of circulation implies not
only that labour is factored out of (Capitalist) production, but
**Capital itself now is factored out of (virtual)
reproduction**]{.underline}. The cycle of history, with its stories
replete of [the rise and fall of all the dominant signs -- power, war,
labour, Capital, sex -- breaks with the ossified structures of modernist
myth, setting in motion the latest historical play, that of virtuality
to be the once and always hoped for unifier of the siren of
history.]{.underline} However, to speak of virtuality and history in one
breath, to see in the circuits of virtuality a terminus ad quem of
historical indeterminacy, is already to escape the present dialectic of
Capital and virtuality, [to say that in the valorization of the
value-form of Capital lie not only the origins of the will to
virtuality, but the future as the metaphysics of technicity. To say this
is impossible, because **to speak of the overcoming of Capital in the**
**language of technicity**]{.underline}, to announce Marx's famous
'circuit of circulation' for what it is, the basic code of the fully
realized technological future, would be also to brush Heidegger against
Marx, to speak, that is, of the hidden presence in Marx's Capital of
Heidegger's will to technicity. But we all know that Marx was a prophet
of the left and Heidegger a tombstone of the right, so this encircling,
indeed this declension of the invisible Heidegger in the visible Marx,
is not permitted. Unless, that is, the equally famous 'forgetting' in
Heidegger's ontology of being is not the withdrawal of the gods from the
'desolation of the earth,' but another more proximate forgetting: [the
withdrawal of the visible signs of Capitalist accumulation from the
(virtual) circuit of circulation]{.underline}. Marx, then, as the
precondition of Heidegger, and Heidegger as the epiphany of Marx: a
historical incompossibility.

From [the 'Circuit of (Capitalist) Circulation' to the **Circulation of
(Digital) Circuits**]{.underline}

[In circulation, the Capitalist and worker confront each other only as
the vendors of commodities, but owing to the specific, opposed nature of
the commodities they sell to each other, the worker necessarily enters
the process of production as a component of the use-value, the real
existence, of Capital, its existence as value]{.underline}. And this
remains true even though that relationship only constitutes itself
within the process of production, and the Capitalist, who exists only as
a potential purchaser of labor, becomes a real Capitalist only when the
worker, who can be turned into wage-labor only through the sale of his
capacity for labor, really does submit to the commands of Capital. [The
functions fulfilled by the Capitalist are no more than the functions of
Capital -- viz. The valorization of value by absorbing living labor
power -- executed consciously and willingly.29]{.underline}

[When capitalism finally breaks with the materiality of production,
entering its **metaphysical stage as a pure 'value-form**,' then the
classic Marxian model of the Capitalist 'circuit of circulation' gives
way to the **circulation of circuits**. While the circuit of circulation
is the basis of the original Capitalist model of production, the circuit
of circulation is the new model of the virtual model of
production]{.underline}. This is a predictable outcome of the Marxian
model. Everywhere in Marx's writings lurks the spectre of circulation.
[There is no Capitalist, only a 'Capitalist function\[ing\] \... as
personified Capital, Capital as a person, just as the worker is no more
than labour personified]{.underline}.'30 Everything and everyone is a
function of their relationship to the value-form of Capitalist
circulation. [No autonomous labour, only labour valorized as use-value;
**no independent Capitalist**, only the bourgeoisie valorized as a
command function for the extraction of surplus value from living labour
power; no terminal production, only production as a twofold sign of the
beginning and ending of the circuit of Capitalist circulation; and
certainly no autonomous processes of consumption, exchange, and
distribution, only a general circuit of circulation that requires for
its growth that the (economic) phases of production, consumption,
distribution, and exchange align with one another in that spectacular
circular flow, that speed and magnitude of circulation, that
valorization of the pure valueform of Capitalism.]{.underline} What was
previously the fate of the individual Capitalist -- his reduction to
'Capital personified' -- and the destiny of the worker -- 'use-value'
submitting to the 'commands of Capital' -- quickly becomes the ruling
axiomatic of virtual capitalism. Pure circulation, pure speed, pure
value-form, pure technicity.

Indeed, if Marx could speak so hauntingly in Capital of the relationship
between labour and capital as that of 'animals and machines,' perhaps
that is because his image of the circuit of capitalist circulation is
deeply biological. Capital, then, as an extended biogenetic description
of the original, governing cellular matter of the DNA of Capitalism. In
this case, Marx's searing vision of workers as use-value objectified and
Capitalists as Capitalism personified quickly generalizes into a
biologi- cal theory of the circuit of circulation
(production-exchange-distribution-consumption) as the original economic
genome, not only for the historical development of the process of
Capitalist production, but as the cellular material for mixing,
splicing, recombining circuits of virtual clones. When not only
labourers and Capitalists but also [the circuit of circulation itself is
**violently thrown into circulation**, when production is blasted apart
by the globalization of manufacturing, when consumption is consumed by
the circulation of signs, when exchange is digitally networked, when
distribution is resequenced as a digital nervous system, then at that
point we can speak of recombinant Capitalism as the destiny prefigured
by Capital. Circuits of (virtual) consumption, circuits of (technical)
production, circuits of (networked) distribution, circuits of (fast)
exchange, all of which are simultaneously linked in a global model
spearheaded by the **circuit of virtual circulation**, but all of which
also immediately condense into the fourfold logic of the original
circuit -- production, consumption, distribution, exchange. Faithful to
their cybernetic expression as the final value-form of advanced
Capitalism and, consequently, the original prototype of **virtual
Capitalism**, what matters are not the terminals of production,
consumption, exchange, and distribution but the speed and magnitude of
the process of circulation itself. Here, everything enters into
circulation, and no one is allowed to refuse circulation; everything is
circuited, **no one can abandon the power of the circuit**. Pure
circulation then as the precondition and product]{.underline} of the
virtual model of the circulation of circuits.

That's the real effect of the technological process of production. [Not
simply a circuit of (Capitalist) production, but other circuits as well:
circuits of production, circuits of consumption, circuits of
distribution, circuits of exchange. All linked and overlapping, all
autonomous and **indeterminate in their origins**.]{.underline}

The classic model of the circuit of circulation can give rise to a
process of multiple circulation of circuits because the 'value-form' can
be cloned, replicated, reproduced, re-circuited. No longer embedded in
the facticity of material production, circulation is about speed,
magnitude, and vectors.

TECHNOLOGY AND THE CULTURE OF NIHILISM: HEIDEGGER, NIETZSCHE, AND MARX",

[Or is something else at work in the contemporary era? Not simply the
Capitalists' ability to supervise and discipline labor,27 but just the
opposite, **technology's ability to supervise and discipline
Capital**]{.underline}. Just as the Capitalist 'will always seek to
extend the duration and intensity of work,' [the will to virtuality
necessitates the extension of the duration and intensity of Capital. The
process of Capitalist production is **not allowed to
pause**:]{.underline} consequently, the twenty-four-hour stock market
pacing the celestial movements of the earth as it rotates around the
sun, after-hours trading as a way of disturbing the rhythms of daytime
trading, [streamed capitalism as the final triumph of extensiveness over
duration, of **dead (technological) space over the time of living
Capital**.]{.underline}

Whereas in the industrial Capitalism of the twentieth century, the
decisive political struggle was between labour and Capital, in the
virtual Capitalism of the twenty-first century, the key historical
contradiction lies between Capital and virtuality, between, that is,
[the will to Capitalist accumulation and the accumulative instincts of
the will to virtuality.]{.underline}

In a fantastic intensification and abstraction of the historical drama
between living labour and dead Capital charted in all its theoretical
precision and economic granularity by Marx's Capital, [virtual
Capitalism means, in its essentials, that in the twenty-first century
Capital will, and does, occupy the same position as labour in the modern
era. Just as the worker in relation to the Capitalist appropriation of
surplus-value creates a 'value alien'28 to himself, namely the
valorization of the Capitalist process of production, so too Capital in
relationship to virtuality also creates a value alien to
itself.]{.underline} Incorporated into the digital process of
production, at first as its necessary condition of historical
development and later as its spectacular product, [Capital now creates a
surplus-value of virtuality, a speed and magnitude of digital technology
that is **not reducible for its explanation to the laws of Capital
accumulation**, and on behalf of which Capital is forced to serve as its
historical incubator.]{.underline} While in industrial Capitalism,
Capital in its fateful contestation with labour was the leading
historical force, in virtual Capitalism, Capitalism declines into a
residual historical category, a transitional state between the
historically particular absorption of labour into the machinery of
Capitalist accumulation and the global appropriation of Capitalism into
a dynamic medium for the valorization of the technological process of
(digital) production.

The Genealogy of Virtual Capitalism

Consequently, the great value of reading Marx's Capital retrospectively,
not from the vantage-point of the modern century on the cusp of the
supposed post-Capitalist future but from the perspective of the
muchvaunted digital future looking backwards, is that Marx provides both
a brilliant genealogy of the birth of Capitalism and an equally
insightful 'futurology' of its eclipse. Not, however, the eclipse of
Capitalism by its 'objective' historical opponent -- living labour --
but [the overcoming of Capitalism by its historical transformation into
its **pure (metaphysical) form**, what Marx glimpsed from afar as the
'circuit of circulation' and what we now experience directly as the will
to virtuality. Shedding the necessity of actual production, transcending
the model of consump- tion, transforming distribution into networked
vectors, and accelerating the language of exchange into mathematics of a
'three-tiered digital architecture,' **the will to virtuality exists now
as the pure form of the circuit of Capitalism that Marx first
prophesied**]{.underline}, and which in its first tentative steps
announces itself, at first hesitatingly and then gathering strength from
its global momentum, as the triumph of the will to virtuality.

Relentlessly focused on the political struggle of Capital and labour,
socialization and privatization, collective consciousness and individual
accumulation, [Marx's thought is primarily about labour, only
secondarily about Capital, a matter of dialectics, not code. Thus the
great irony. It is not to the dialectics of living labour and dead
labour that we are compelled, finally and critically, to look for the
sources of the overcoming of Capitalism, but to **the metaphysics of
Capitalism itself**. Capitalism will not, and does not, survive its
transformation from content to form, from its material-form to its
value-form, from a circuit of **production to a pure circuit of
circulation**]{.underline}. And why? Because Capitalism as a 'circuit of
circulation,' in its contemporary representation as a pure form of
valorization, is only apparently the value-form of Capital accumulation,
but concretely the value-form of virtuality. At the heart of Marx's
Capital is less a haunting analysis of the dialectics of labour and
Capital than a prophetic diagnosis of the hidden code of virtuality.
Because that's what Marx's language of the 'value-form' of Capitalism
really concerns, [not Capital accumulation in its strict economic
determination but the accumulative energies of the 'circuit of
circulation' in its dynamic technological determination. Set in motion
by the historical alibi of market-driven Capitalist accumulation, by the
market-subordinated language of production, consumption, distribution,
and exchange, the 'circuit of circulation' cannot, and does not, resist
valorizing itself as its own value-form]{.underline}. Not the value-form
of Capital which now occupies a position with respect to it previously
assumed by (industrial) labour in relationship to Capital, namely
use-value, but the value-form of virtuality. Once stripped of its
use-value of Capital, Marx's 'circuit of circulation' is the
(technological) successor of Capitalism, the matrix of the will to
virtuality. Ironically, just when everyone thought that Marx had been
safely dispensed by historical events, in this period when the
revolutionary fires of the early socialism of living labour-power have
been withered away by the autocratic policies of official state
socialism in the East and by official (trade) unionism in the West, at
this precise moment the labyrinth of history reverses itself. [The pages
of Capital open to the section on the 'circuit of circulation' and we
suddenly exit Marx's theological narrative of (living) proletariat and
(dead) Capital, falling into the future of the will to virtuality in its
first appearance as the **pure value-form of the circuit of
circulation**.]{.underline}

In his semantic taking over of the concept and emptying it of all things
political and class-related, Kelly argues that [the **emerging** form of
**socialism** is "uniquely tuned for a **networked**
**world**"]{.underline} and far away from "your grandfather's socialism
\[...\] [It is **not** **class** **warfare**. It is **not**
**anti**-**American**"]{.underline} (Kelly 2009). In Kelly's
cyber-utopian rhetoric, [**digital** **social** becomes in fact "**the
newest American innovation**", a type of "**socialism without the
state**", running over "a borderless Internet" and "designed to heighten
individual autonomy and thwart centralization"]{.underline} (Kelly
2009). In his colourful techno-language, [**digital** **socialism**
**replaces** the **tedious** **bureaucracy** of the five-year plans with
the "**brilliant chaos of a free market**", refashioning **state**
**factories** into "**desktop factories connected to virtual co-ops**",
and **exchanging** **national** **production** with **peer**
**production**, "government rations and subsidies" with a "**bounty of
free goods**"]{.underline} (Kelly 2009). In his apology of digital
socialism, Kelly feels to have to justify the choice of "such an
inflammatory heading" and "redeem" it, as "technically it is the best
word to indicate a range of technologies that rely for their power on
social interactions" (Kelly 2009). In his over excitement for all things
tech, [when the **masses** "contribute labor **without** **wages** and
enjoy the **fruits** **free** of **charge**"]{.underline} (Kelly 2009),
[**that's socialism**.]{.underline} As much as
**[Amazon]{.underline}'s** Mechanical Turk **[is
socialism]{.underline}**, real-time Twitter and RSS feeds are socialism,
unlimited free cloud computing and passionate opinions on the Huffington
Post are socialism of the digital type that Kelly heralds as the new,
perfect form of "cultural OS" elevating "both the individual and the
group at once" (Kelly 2009). One might excuse this over-enthusiastic
apology by looking at the time in which it was authored, 2009, a year
that was, for many, still full of digital promises and utopias. But
Kelly believes so staunchly in digital socialism that he makes sure to
declare his long-term view over the matter. Even if this phenomenon has
not yet reached the mainstream at the time of his writing, "clearly the
population that lives with socialized media is significant", Kelly
emphasises. "[The **number** **of** **people** who **make things for**
**free**, share things for free, use things for free, belong to
**collective** **software** farms, work on **projects** that **require**
**communal decisions**, or experience the **benefits** of
**decentralized socialism** has reached **millions** and
**counting**]{.underline}" (Kelly 2009). And, he vigorously concludes,
"[**revolutions** have **grown** out of **much smaller
numbers**]{.underline}" (Kelly 2009). Ten years after this passionate
attempt to redefine the meaning of socialism, the USA's enemy number one
[**China** seems to have **learned** the]{.underline} guru's [**lesson**
and **embedded** it into **institutional** **forms**]{.underline},
[**implementing** an up-to-date version of state-led digital
socialism.]{.underline} In 2020, the so-called "[social credit system"
will **standardise** the **assessment** of citizens' **reputation**
**producing** a mechanism for **ranking** them according to their
**social** **and** **economic** **behaviours** and sanctioning them if
they fail to pay taxes on time]{.underline}, as much as if they do not
show up after having booked a restaurant table or a hotel room. In this
dystopian, Black-Mirror like15 framework, [the **Chinese**
**government** seems,]{.underline} in its turn, [to have borrowed
**mechanisms** of **control** and **surveillance** not from
**repressive** institutions or **authoritarian regimes**, but precisely
from the **new digital social** of social networking
**platforms**.]{.underline} A way to visualise and quantify, therefore
[to **evaluate**, **control**, and **sanction** social
**relationships**, that is possible to adopt at a **state level and in
such a pervasive**, dystopian fashion only after the **mechanism** has
become not just **acceptable** and **familiar** but, also, **desirable**
for the **global masses**.]{.underline} While this semantic redefinition
is carried out, albeit in different ways, both by Silicon Valley's
libertarian utopians and by China's new institutional form of
authoritarianism concealed under the more attractive guise of the
digital, the European Union responds to the hegemonic re-appropriation
of the social by emphasising its citizens' rights to own their data and
to protect their privacy. The General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR)16 is probably the most striking example of such a timid,
apprehensive reaction to the takeover of the social, which reveals a
lack of a proper understanding of this phenomenon happening at a global
scale. GDPR attempts at building a defence against the aggressive
pervasiveness of the digital social by giving individuals the (illusion
of) control and ownership of their data, upon which they would enjoy the
right to request a portable copy and also, under certain circumstances,
the possibility to have them erased. However, this promise of opening
"the algorithmic 'black box' to promote challenge, redress, and
hopefully heightened accountability" (Edwards and Veale 2017, 18) might
just result into yet another "transparency fallacy" (Edwards and Veale
2017, 43), as there are complicated legal and infrastructure-related
issues that might prevent the granted rights to be properly exercised by
their holders. And yet even these legal or infrastructural impediments
are not what is really at stake with the GDPR and similar policies. Its
underlying problem is rather, in my view, an approach responding to the
pervasive appropriation of the digital domain that renders all things
digital "social" by simply reaffirming values such as ownership and
property. The stark contradiction between data that have constantly to
move and circulate -- that have to be "spreadable" (Jenkins, Ford and
Green 2013) -- as per the business model of all things social, and the
right to own and control such fluctuating, pervasive, and
ever-multiplying immaterial goods, becomes apparent here. [It's the
**overall** **acceptance** of a giant money machine and
**revenue**-**making** **system** in the **hope** of regaining control
of it by **tweaking** some **small** **details**.]{.underline} It's a
David and Goliath situation, where the actual little stone being thrown
at the latter's forehead does not affect the whole gigantic immaterial
apparatus firmly in place. The contradiction inherent in a GDPR-like
approach is that while we struggle to regain little bits of ownership
and control over our data, the "feedback infrastructure" (Morozov 2019)
stays firmly in the hands of platform capitalism. This rights-based
attitude and the values themselves that it claims to defend and protect
-- property, ownership and privacy -- are the core of the problem, not
its antidote. [**Claiming back ownership** and privacy **does** **not**
**challenge** the **system**, instead it seeks to **mitigate** the
**worst** **effects** of **communicative** **capitalism**]{.underline},
[protecting **small** **territories** of individual freedoms against a
**market** that stays as **greedy** as ever]{.underline} (if not more),
[appealing to **individual** **personal** **rights** and
responsibilities **rather** **than** addressing a **political**
**collective**.]{.underline}

#### The worker has disappeared \-\-- the lack of spatial proximity and continuity between workers denies the possibility of class solidarity fomenting meaningful resistance. Moreover, Marx's economic theory understands labor as divisible into discrete units of time, but the floating, arbitrary value of money combined with the depersonalization of time means today's cognitive worker no longer has no discrete surplus-value to be stolen

[The [recombinant **alliance** of **cognitive work and financial capital
was over**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The young army of free agents,
selfexploiters and virtual prosumers was transformed into modernity's
horde of precarious cognitive workers: **cognitarians**]{.underline},
[cognitive proletarians and internet-slaves who invest nervous energy in
exchange for a precarious revenue.]{.underline}

**[[Precarity is the]{.mark} general [condition of
semio-workers]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [The essential feature of
[precarity in the social sphere is not the loss of regularity in the
labour relation, since labour has always been more or less
precarious]{.mark}]{.underline}, notwithstanding legal regulations[. The
essential transformation induced by the digitalization of the labour
process is the fragmentation of the personal continuity of work, the
fractalization and cellularization of time. The **[worker disappears as
a person]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and is replaced by abstract fragments
of time. The cyberspace of global production can be viewed as an immense
expanse of depersonalized human time. [In the sphere of industrial
production, abstract labour time was embodied in a worker of flesh and
bone, with a certified and political identity]{.underline}. When [the
boss]{.underline} was in need of human time for capital valorization, he
[was obliged to hire a human being, and was obliged to deal with the
physical weaknesses]{.underline}, maladies and rights of this human
being; was obliged to face trade unions reclaims and the political
demands of which the human was a bearer.

As we move into the age of info-labour, [there is [no longer a need to
invest in the availability of a person for eight hours a
da]{.mark}y]{.underline} throughout the duration of his or her life.
[[Capital]{.mark} no longer recruits people, but [buys packets of time,
separated from their interchangeable and occasional
bearers]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the internet economy, flexibility has
evolved into a form of fractalization of work.

Fractalization is the modular and recombinant fragmentation of the
period of activity. [The [worker no longer exists]{.mark} as a
person]{.underline}. He or she is only an interchangeable producer of
micro-fragments of recombinant semiosis that enter into the continuous
flux of the internet. Capital no longer pays for the availability of a
worker to be exploited for a long period of time; it no longer pays a
salary that covers the entire range of economic needs of a person who
works.

The worker (a machine endowed with a brain that can be used for
fragments of time) is paid for his or her occasional, temporary
services. Work time is fragmented and cellularized. Cells of time are
put up for sale online, and businesses can purchase as many of them as
they want without being obligated in any way to provide any social
protection to the worker. [Depersonalized time has become the real agent
of the process of valorization, and depersonalized time has no rights,
no union organization and no political consciousness]{.underline}. It
can only be either available or unavailable -- although this latter
alternative remains purely theoretical inasmuch as the physical body
still has to buy food and pay rent, despite not being a legally
recognized person.

[The time necessary to produce the info-commodity is liquefied by the
recombinant digital machine]{.underline}. The human machine is there,
pulsating and available, like a brainsprawl in waiting. The extension of
time is meticulously cellularized: cells of productive time can be
mobilized in punctual, casual and fragmentary forms. The recombination
of these fragments is automatically realized in the network. [The mobile
phone is the tool that makes possible the connection between the needs
of semiocapital and the mobilization of the living labour of
cyberspac]{.underline}e. The ringtone of the mobile phone summons
workers to reconnect their abstract time to the reticular flux.

In this new labour dimension, people [have no right to protect or
negotiate the time of which they are formally the proprietors, but are
effectively expropriated. That time does not really belong to them,
because it is separated from the social existence of the people who make
it available to the recombinant cyber-productive circuit.]{.underline}
The time of work is fractalized, reduced to minimal fragments that can
be reassembled, and the fractalization makes it possible for capital to
constantly find the conditions of the minimal salary. **[Fractalized
work can punctually rebel, here and there, at certain points -- but this
does not set into motion any concerted endeavour of
resistance.]{.underline}**

**[[Only]{.mark} the [spatial proximity of the bodies of labourers and
the continuity of the experience of working together lead to the
possibility of a continuous process of
solidarity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Without this proximity and this
continuity, the conditions for the cellularized bodies to coalesce into
community do not pertain.]{.underline} [Individual behaviours can only
come together to form a substantive collective momentum when there is a
**continuous proximity in time, a proximity that info-labour no longer
makes possible.**]{.underline}

Cognitive activity has always been involved in every kind of human
production, even that of a more mechanical type. There is no process of
human labour that does not involve an exercise of intelligence. But
today, **[[cognitive capacity is becoming the essential productive
resource]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the age of industrial labour, the
mind was put to work as a repetitive automatism, the neurological
director of muscular effort. While industrial work was essentially
repetition of physical acts, mental work is continuously changing its
object and its procedures.

Thus, the subsumption of the mind in the process of capitalist
valorization leads to a true mutation. [The conscious and sensitive
organism is subjected to a growing competitive pressure, to an
acceleration of stimuli]{.underline}, to a constant exertion of his/her
attention. As a consequence, [the mental environment, the info-sphere in
which the mind is formed and enters into relations with other minds,
becomes a psychopathogenic environment.]{.underline}

[To understand semiocapital's infinite game of mirrors, we must first
outline a new disciplinary field, delimited by three aspects: the
critique of political economy of connective intelligence; the semiology
of linguistic-economic fluxes; and the psychochemistry of the
info-sphere, focused on the study of the psychopathological effects of
the mental exploitation caused by the acceleration of the
info-sphere.]{.underline}

In the connected world, the retroactive loops of general systems theory
are fused with the dynamic logic of biogenetics to form a post-human
vision of digital production. [Human minds and flesh are integrated with
digital circuits thanks to interfaces of acceleration and
simplification: a model of bio-info production is emerging that produces
semiotic artefacts with the capacity for the auto- replication of living
systems. Once fully operative, the digital nervous system can be rapidly
installed in every form of organization.]{.underline}

[The digital network is provoking an intensification of the
info-stimuli, and these are transmitted from the social brain to
individual brains]{.underline}. This **[[acceleration is a pathogenic
factor that has wide-ranging effects in society.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Since capitalism is wired into the social brain, [a [psychotic meme of
acceleration acts as pathological agent: the organism is **drawn into a
spasm until collapse**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### The bourgeoisie has disappeared: in the regime of semiocapitalism, there's nothing to rebel against. Their replacement, the "elsewhere class," engages in a constant reterritorialization of random financial value that makes effective resistance impossible.

Semiocapital and the Ethics of Baroque

Crime used to be a secret act. In the age of repression and
industriousness, when the morality of the bourgeoisie was reigning,
crime wanted to be secret. Law aimed at preventing crime, and it
encouraged investigations of criminals in order to punish them.

This order of things has irrevocably changed in the last turn of time,
especially since the advent of the semiocapitalist regime.

[Semiocapitalism occupies the sphere of randomness of value, as well as
the sphere of **randomness of law** and of moral judgement]{.underline}.

[The entire strategy of the system lies in this **hyper-reality of
floating values**]{.underline}. It is the same for money and theory as
for the unconscious. [Value rules according to an ungraspable
order]{.underline}: [the generation of models]{.underline}, [the
indefinite chaining of simulation]{.underline}. Cybernetic
operationality, the genetic code, [the random order of
mutations,]{.underline} [the principle of uncertainty]{.underline}, and
so on: all of [these replace a determinist and objectivist science, a
dialectical vision of history and consciousness]{.underline}.1

Baudrillard is talking of value in economic terms. In the post-Fordist
transition, the relation between work-time and value is jeopardized, as
immaterial production and cognitive work are difficult to properly
gauge. But the random effect is not limited to the sphere of the
economy, as it spreads both to the sphere of social relations and to
that of ethics.

[The current, generalized perception of widespread corruption is neither
a superficial impression, nor the effect of a deterioration of the moral
character of people]{.underline}.

**[It is a systemic effect of the randomization of value]{.underline}**.
[When value can no longer be determined by the precise relation to
work-time]{.underline}, [its determinant factors]{.underline} [become
**deception**, **swindle**, **violence**]{.underline}. Mafia ceases to
be a marginal phenomenon of lawlessness, instead becoming the prevailing
force of emerging capitalist economies like Russia and Mexico. At the
same time, [fraud is legalized and organized in the global financial
market as a systemic feature]{.underline}.

As it becomes increasingly institutionalized, [crime loses its secrecy
and demands access to the spectacle]{.underline}. [The visibility of
crime becomes part of the effectiveness and persuasiveness of
power]{.underline}. [Competition is all about subduing, cheating,
predating]{.underline}. [Blaming the victims is part of the
game]{.underline}: [you are guilty of your inability to subdue,
to]{.underline} [cheat and to plunder]{.underline}, [therefore you will
be submitted to the blackmail of debt and to the tyranny of
austerity]{.underline}.

Nazism already enacted spectacular crime as a means to secure absolute
power, but the criminal acts conducted in the name of the 'Final
Solution' were secretly organized and performed away from the public
eye. [Evil was proclaimed and simultaneously denied in the name of the
superior values of family, homeland and God]{.underline}. [On the
contrary, reclaiming evil has become commonplace in today's financial
markets, as the old ethics of bourgeois Protestantism is progressively
cancelled by the]{.underline} [neobaroque, post-bourgeois ethics of the
deterritorialized financial class.]{.underline}

The bourgeoisie was a strongly territorialized class, whose power was
based on the property of physical assets, and on the fact of belonging
to a stable community. Protestant ethics was based on the long-lasting
relationship between the religious community and the labourers and
consumers who shared the same place and the same destiny.

Nowadays, **[the bourgeoisie has disappeared]{.underline}**. The
financial deterritorialization is generating a post-bourgeois class,
which has no relation to the territory and to community.

It is a class that is not concerned with the future of any specific
territorial community, because tomorrow it will move its business to a
different part of the world. We might call it [the 'elsewhere
class']{.underline}, as it [continuously displaces the stakes of its
investment]{.underline}. But [we may also call it a 'virtual
class']{.underline}, for two reasons: [because it is the class that
gains profits from virtual activities, like net trading, and high tech
immaterial production]{.underline}; and because it is the class that
does not actually [exist. Identifying those who are investing in the
financial market is difficult, impossible, as everybody is obliged to
depend on it.]{.underline}

In a sense, [everybody is part of the class that is investing in the
financial market]{.underline}. Including myself. [As a teacher I am
bound to wait for a pension, and I know that my pension will be paid if
some investment funds will be profitable, therefore I am obliged to
depend for my **future revenue** on the **profitability of the financial
market**]{.underline}. **[The 'elsewhere class']{.underline}** [has
re-established the economic rationale of the rentier, as profit is no
longer linked to the expansion of the existing wealth, but is linked to
the mere possession of an invisible asset]{.underline}: money, or, more
accurately, credit.

According to Thomas Stewart:

[Money has dematerialized]{.underline}. [Once upon a time officials of
the Federal Reserve Bank]{.underline} of New York [were loading gold
bars onto trolleys and rolled them from one]{.underline} [country's
basement to another. Today some 1.3 trillion in currency is traded every
day, and never takes a tangible form.]{.underline}

[Money has turned ethereal, volatile and electronic]{.underline}.
[Nothing more than an assemblage of ones and zeros that are piped
through miles of wire, pumped over fiberoptic]{.underline}
[highways]{.underline}, [bounced off satellites, and beamed from one
microwave relay station to another.]{.underline} [This new money is like
a shadow]{.underline}. It has no tactile dimension, no heft or weight.
[Money is an image.]{.underline}2

[The **post-bourgeois class of virtual finance has no homeland, no
community, no belonging, and also no money**. Just faith. Faith in
signs, in figures. The post-bourgeois class announces the return of the
baroque.]{.underline}

Although defeated and marginalized during the age of bourgeois progress
and the rational organization of social life, the baroque has never
disappeared.

[Its spirit is based on the primacy of the spectacle, on the
multiplication of possible interpretations, on randomness of value and
of meaning, or the potency of **arbitrary** and **violent
will**]{.underline}. Not surprisingly, Curzio Malaparte, a writer who
took part in Italian Fascism before changing his position during the
Second World War, in Europa vivente, published in 1925, speaks of
Italian Fascism as a return of the baroque. Northern Europeans are wrong
to think that modernity is only a Protestant business, says Malaparte.
Fascism is the reclaiming of the modern soul of Southern Europeans, and
the political spectacle of Mussolini is the resurgence of the baroque
cult of inessentiality, decoration, excess: arbitrary power.

But [arbitrariness is not only a **defining feature** of Fascism, it is
also the **quintessential character** of the **semio capitalist** form
of **accumulation**]{.underline}. The power of the resurgent baroque is
[fully exposed by the transformation of the economy into
**semioproduction**]{.underline}. [When **language**, **imagination**,
**information** and **immaterial flows**]{.underline} [become the force
of production and the general space of exchange]{.underline}, [when
property is deterritorialized and becomes immaterial]{.underline}, [the
**baroque spirit** becomes the all-encompassing form, both of the
economy and of ethical discourse]{.underline}.

longer think of itself or function in a society of other cyborgs being
confined to these categories of difference and distinction. Notably, the
rise of technological networks in the 1980s and beyond made some
theorists hopeful that this would signify an end to sex differences
being defined within the realm of embodiment (Puar, 2012; Wajcman, 2004,
2007), and the transhumanist movement started to formally organize and
attempt to disseminate its ideology into the world during the same
period (Bostrom, 2005). It was not necessarily the promise of machines,
per se, that began peeling away the very definitions of what it meant to
be human, but rather the sophistication and intelligence of the machines
themselves and their capabilities that started to break down the idea of
bodies 'ending at the skin' (Wilkerson, 1997). [However, instead of
shifting away essentialized notions of gender and sex away from the
body, the technological revolution of the late 20th and early 21st
century may have further **reified and cemented these differences**
rather than usurping them -- and, as recent conversations have begun to
point out, this extends beyond gender and affects subjectivity and
embodied notions of sexuality, race, and ability.]{.underline}

[Although Haraway famously made her claim that she would rather be a
cyborg than a goddess]{.underline} to mark the departure of the idea of
the woman being a natural, biologically driven 'goddess' of the Earth
and to embrace the potential of science and technology in what it could
provide in shifting the idea of woman as a naturalized, essential
concept, [the issue still remains that **technology is shaped by human
factors**, and that in turn, it **shapes us and our humanity.** Further
adding to this entangled shaping and shifting that occurs is the
rejection of the nature driven idea of the woman (the goddess) and
replacing it with the cyborg. Is this desire to replace the concept of
woman as goddess with the identity of the cyborg an indicator of washing
away humankind's need to tame nature? Or does it merely replace **one
technology of control with another**? Indeed, the idea of the cyborg is
a seductive one because it would potentially replace all of the fragile
parts of our humanity with artificial and indestructible ones, but the
epistemic groundings upon which much of science and technology are built
upon and of which the cyborg is built upon are **fraught with
violence**.]{.underline}

I will never forget the first time I read 'A Cyborg Manifesto' and felt
completely and utterly overwhelmed with a certain brand of imposter
syndrome reserved for first generation women of color in the academe.
Rather than feeling liberated, I felt I was [introduced another
definition of being through 'cyborg' that seemingly served to further
**privilege a certain kind of body above others (i.e., a white,
able-bodied one).**]{.underline} As Wajcman notes, 'the possibility and
the fluidity of gender discourse in the virtual world is constrained by
the material world', (Wajcman, 2007: 292), and [when technology is
predominantly controlled and made by men, this further adds material
constraints to what technology is capable of in granting the agency to
redefine race, gender, and sexuality for those that seek to reconfigure
themselves by their own terms.]{.underline} As Puar notes by citing
Currier, ['the theorization of cyborgs winds up unwittingly
'**reinscribing the cyborg into the binary logic of identity which
Haraway hopes to circumvent'**]{.underline} (Currier 2003: 323)' (Puar,
2012: 56--57). Although Haraway's intention with A Cyborg Manifesto was
to break new ground in conceptualizing about bodies during the
transhumanist turn, [the cyborg does no**t necessarily represent a
breakaway** from essentialized and dichotomized notions of identity, but
exists in the liminal space not oppositionally but frictionally against
other subjects and identities (Puar, 2012).]{.underline}

[The cyborg does not come without baggage, and in fact comes with its
own value codes, which is perhaps **amplified** by our increasingly
data-driven society that is run by algorithms and other agents that
exist in technological infrastructures]{.underline}. Atanasoski and Vora
discuss in their essay how these technological, networked
infrastructures have begun to bring into question not even who counts as
cyborg, but who and what even qualifies as human (Atanasoski and Vora,
2015). Their essay illustrates the limits of posthumanist fantasies of
surpassing the boundaries of humanity, and how the views of this techno
utopia formulate the 'surrogate human'. [Further, the fantasy that
humans can be freed by technology from labor has perhaps **collapsed in
the age of the networked society**, and although surrogate humanity may
mark a shift away from capitalism, 'it does so by **reaffirming existing
paradigms of racialized and gendered value** through the figure of a
surrogate human who performs degraded work that is always already meant
to be invisible', (]{.underline}Atanasoski and Vora, 2015: 7). Although
not dealing with the concept of cyborg per se, this essay marks the
introduction of the concept of the transhuman, the posthuman, and the
surrogate human that technology has promised to create -- and its
failures to transcend identity in the form of gender, race, class, and
ability, and rather continues to function and uphold in a colonialist,
historical, capitalist power structure. Technology, the Internet of
Things, data, and algorithms that enable the structure of modern day
society are never neutral, and in fact all of [these data-driven
practices further 'materializes assumptions of what constitutes a human
. . .']{.underline} (Atanasoski and Vora, 2015: 13).

['Techno-utopics]{.underline} surrounding big data, smart objects, and
internetworking of humans and machines, however, do not dwell in the
vitality of matter, but rather propose the thing as a surrogate human.
In this way, they [**replicate the violent neoliberal impetus** to
enfold difference into sameness -- into a shared space and time',
(Atanasoski and Vora, 2015: 16).]{.underline} However as Holland notes
in their work The Erotic Life of Racism, there are beings that exist in
time (white people) and beings who exist in space (Black people) -- and
when these two beings collide, there is an affront to the material and
societal order within which they exist. [The idea of technology, the
cyborg, the transhuman and the posthuman as identities that exist in a
utopia, in a beyond, **is a myth** that is being perpetuated and shifted
by those who already benefit from hegemonic paradigms of what counts as
being human in the first place]{.underline}. Bhattarai's essay then
further illustrates these concepts in their essay discussing algorithmic
value, and how even [investments in algorithms that seem benign are in
fact reproducing a certain **cultural logic of power** in terms of
knowledge, labor, and bodies]{.underline} (Bhattarai, 2017). [The
idea]{.underline} of source code, of algorithms, of data being the
genesis of action [is **naïve** -- 'because their agency is enabled and
constrained by a larger network of cultural and economic encodings that
render them executable']{.underline}, (Bhattarai, 2017: 21),
illuminating again that attempts to make technology and the tech world
more inclusive and diverse as well as the attempts to use the category
of cyborg as transcending difference are merely the master's tools
disguised as revolutionary action.

[Technology (and thus, cyborgs), since it is created by humans, carries
with it the **same limitations as humanity** in terms of its ability to
provide transcendence of our categorizations of race, class, gender, and
ability. In effect, the 'source code' is already imbued with certain
assumptions of all of these categories of difference, since it is
written from the epistemological standpoint and values of those who
create it]{.underline} (Benjamin, 2019; Noble, 2018). [If
the]{.underline} tech industry and [tech world is heavily dominated by
whiteness, by maleness, then in what capacity do those who do not fit
into hegemonic notions of humanity (white, cis, hetero, male) figure
into these infrastructural equations? Epistemic sites of thought in the
theorization of the transhuman, of the posthuman, of the cyborg all
exist within the same epistemic paradigms upon which all science and
technology are built upon -- **colonialist, Western, white** -- and thus
are **limited in fully conceptualizing a beyond**.]{.underline}

The concept of the cyborg has been fundamental in informing multiple
fields -- most notably, science and technology studies, women and gender
studies, communication, postmodernism, digital culture, and more
(Glazier, 2016). Haraway's influence on these fields and even beyond
them is irrefutable -- however[, the 'universality' of the cyborg is the
issue at hand. The concept of the cyborg has continued to allow for the
**centering of whiteness and white identity** and a techno-utopic
worldview where technology is seen to be emancipatory, **rather than
oppressive**. Indeed, many problems in our society in the 20th and 21st
century in particular have all had technology thrown at them as a way of
'fixing' the issue -- everything from climate change to racism to even
pandemics]{.underline} (Benjamin, 2019; Engler, 2020; Eubanks, 2012;
Huesemann and Huesemann, 2011). [But time and time again, all of these
'fixes' have rather revealed the **limits of technology** in solving
human problems --]{.underline} however, this has not stopped the slew of
apps, devices, and other technological attempts in an attempt to do so,
with no regard for the people behind the screens. In studying global
digital cultures, [Haraway's notion of the cyborg is **deeply Western**
in its theorization, and **leaves behind** those who do not exist in
Western conceptions of personhood.]{.underline}

Further research on my part revealed that the love affair with A Cyborg
Manifesto had been fraught earlier than I had imagined or seemed to
perceive within my own graduate program and peers -- in an essay from
2001, Maria Fernandez and Suhail Malik wrote, ['Cyborg theory is mostly
a **self-serving sexying up of critical liberalism** through great
gadgetry and concept-busting movements in the technoscientific
organization of living material and extended systems.]{.underline}
Tie-dye T-shirts are swapped for leather deathpants and ethnic beads for
prosthetic hardware in a desperate bid for contemporaneity', (Fernandez
and Malik, 2001). Even going so far to [refer to the notion of the
cyborg as a form of **dogmatism**,]{.underline} Fernandez and Malik note
that [the concept itself is **hypocritical**. Haraway did encourage the
embrace of new technologies as a means of liberation -- however, time
and time again we have seen the ways that technology only continues to
**reify existing power structures, notably white supremacy and
misogyny**]{.underline} (Benjamin, 2019).

[Cyborgs]{.underline}, then, useful as they are in conceptualizing a
departure from traditional notions of identity, [**reify the very
technological institutions which they were meant to disrupt** -- one
that privileges certain bodies and identities and embodiments above
others. Even the idea of the cyborg itself is borne out of a Western
philosophy of selfhood and technology,]{.underline} further adding to
its limits in dismantling categorical conceptions of the self. As
Holland notes, we are not capable of living without categories of
difference (Holland, 2012), and perhaps although the cyborg metaphor
holds so much potential in breaking down our ideas of how the body --
and the self -- are constructed, this reconstruction of the embodied
self through the metaphor of technology indeed has its limits. The
purpose of this essay is not only a collection of my reflections, but
serves to point out the limitations in conceptualizing cyborg as
identity category and form of embodiment, and provides some directions
in which we can begin to build upon and challenge the potential -- and
the potential of its limits -- of the cyborg.

Potentials of its limits: who gets to be a cyborg?

[The identity of cyborg is indeed a privileged one that invokes certain
issues surrounding categorization and of embodiment. The cyborg body is
one that is littered with not only **epistemic violence** in regard to
the foundations on which it is grounded (a Western philosophy of the
self as well as Western views of science and technology), but also in
regard to **class, race, sexuality, and ability**. Technology and the
desire to create and control machines is a realm dominated by Man, and
thus technology itself may **inherently be patriarchal** (Wajcman,
2004), yet women have always been present and have indeed always had a
presence in the design and use of these technologies as
well]{.underline}. In particular, the rise of the networked society and
the ability to shift and shape identity in cyberspace as well as the
rise of the Internet of Things makes the idea of the cyborg woman more
possible than ever before. However, is women's participation in
cyberspace and the technological sphere disruptive of the very basis on
which technology is built? Or is it merely, as Audre Lorde puts it, [a
futile attempt to 'dismantle the master's house with the master's
tools'?]{.underline} (Lorde, 1984). How much potential do science,
technology, and the cyborg identity really hold for women, for people of
color, for the disabled, and for queer persons?

### 2AC\-\--AT: Psychoanalysis

#### The libidinal economy has been cyberneticized -- desire is now formulated through data and virtual capitalism which only the aff can solve

**Kroker 4** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct professor
of political science at the University of Victoria, "THE WILL TO
TECHNOLOGY AND THE CULTURE OF NIHILISM: HEIDEGGER, NIETZSCHE, AND MARX",
University of Toronto Press, Pages 135-139, March 2004, MG)

Now, many working theorists have been this way before. Jean-François
[Lyotard recognized the death knell in the war machine of labour power,
immediately calling for a **recovery of a 'libidinal economy**,'23 a
primitive pre-Marxism that would take labouring flesh back to an economy
of pleasure and pain, an economy of sex and muscle, with the
psychoanalytics of the suppressed id as the wild card in
between]{.underline}. In The Mirror of Production, Jean Baudrillard was
less utopian, more severe.24 In a twentieth-century reprise of that
earlier meeting of French revolutionary thought of 1848 with the
philosophy of the German Enlightenment, Jacobins with Hegel, the Paris
Commune with German conservative reactionism, Baudrillard diagnosed
Marx's sleight of hand at the splitting of labour and labour-power for
what it was: the foundations of a 'structural law of value'25 in which
Capitalism was to be cyberneticized in the form of the ruling axiomatic
of signifier (use-value) and signified (exchange-value). More than
Lyotard, who placed his theoretical bets on drawing out the differend in
Marx's theory of labour, Baudrillard wrote The Mirror of Production as
Marx's avenging angel, always insisting [that the labour theory of
value, far from inaugurating a new possibility of proletarian, let alone
universal, emancipation, only functioned to install the '**rational
terrorism of the code'26** as the ruling order of the Capitalist
axiomatic.]{.underline} For his fateful insights into the happy
complicity of Marxism and Capitalism in sharing exactly the same
episteme of the structural law of value, Baudrillard has suffered the
usual fate: denounced everywhere as a cynic, this the most political of
all thinkers, the most rigorously and naturally Marxist of all the
post-Marxists, banished to an early twilight of thought on the
(Parisian) margins.

[If the twin gestures of Lyotard's Libidinal Economy and Baudrillard's
The Mirror of Production cannot be assimilated into conventional
Marxism, perhaps that is because Marx himself is the first
post-Marxist]{.underline}, the first theorist, that is, who, unsettled
by the ambiguities of identity and difference disguised here as the
language of labour and labour-power, there as the supposedly warring
poles of use-value and exchangevalue, wrote out his labour theory of
value as a secret prolegomenon to a stage of Capitalism not yet
existent**. [A code waiting for a material form]{.underline}**[, a
theory of value awaiting its definite historical conditions of
labour]{.underline}. Marx's Capital, then, not so much an analysis of
the definite conditions for the socialization of labour, although that
too, but [a secret history, written much in the tradition of the cabal,
of a future Capitalism that would represent]{.underline}, as Marx
theorizes in the third volume of Capital, [the really existent history
of 'dead labour.' It is, of course, around the corpse of Marx's 'dead
labour' that Libidinal Economy and The Mirror of Production circle,
sometimes settling in the desert sands for a feeding frenzy of delirious
theory, sometimes startled by the approach of passing armies of the
night, taking flight]{.underline}, almost like a permanent evocation of
ecstasy that was the Paris Commune and the slow decline of the German
bourgeois restoration. Whether by way of Marx, who studiously wrote out
the codes of the (industrial) Capitalist axiomatic only to write 'dead
labour' as its epitaph and future, or by virtue of the chilling
lightness of being of the French mind in the form of Lyotard and
Baudrillard, who always and only begin with the last rites of dead
labour, [the spectre of post-labour haunts the Capitalist
axiomatic.]{.underline}

[And this is as it should be]{.underline}. Because whether expressed in
the language of the 'structural law of value' or in terms of the 'labour
theory of value,' [Capitalism has never been about really existent
labour, but always about the **subordination of labour to the theory of
value.** Modern Capitalism, then, as an industrial
semiotics.]{.underline} A critical point because it indicates that if
[contemporary Capitalism -- digital Capitalism with its globalized
markets and circular flows of Capital -- can so easily escape the
question of labour, can so swiftly disappear labour in the (domestic)
form of 'reductions in the work-place' or in the (international) form of
harvesting the world for perpetually new sources of cheap labour, that
does not indicate that Capitalism has escaped the question of
value]{.underline}. So then, two alternative theses. [First, an
**epistemological thesis** concerning the historical transition of the
value-form of Capitalism: modern Capitalism might have been coded by the
labour theory of value, but twenty-first-century Capitalism will be
organized under the sign of the knowledge-theory of value. **Digital
Capitalism as networked knowledge, not a labour exchange.** Certainly
the safest (theoretical) route. It requires for its affirmation only an
acceptance of the received wisdom that the epochal movement from
industrial to cybernetic Capitalism, from modern Capitalism premised on
the labour theory of value to postmodern Capitalism based on the
knowledge theory of value, takes the form of a general historical
movement to a knowledge-based society, with all its implications for the
triumph of a class of networked specialists over traditional labour
based in fading manufacturing and service sectors. Or, an opposing
**ontological thesis**]{.underline}. A strange thesis concerning the
ambiguity of labour and knowledge, [that labouring activity is **always
knowledge-based activity**, that the knowledge-based society has its
deepest genealogical roots in the first worker who mastered the
cybernetics of the machine age, and that if the fantastic knowledge of
the worker was somehow lost sight of in the rush to the labour-theory of
value that is not to say that it was not always labour-value, but
knowledge-value, that was put into play by the Capitalist
axiomatic]{.underline}. Out of this latter thesis, there emerges an
enigmatic Marx. Not Marx as the nineteenth-century theorist of the
approaching struggle of proletariat and bourgeoisie over the
alternatively exploitative and emancipatory rites of the labour theory
of value, but the spectre of Marx as the twenty-first-century theorist
who, in diagnosing the objective historical conditions for labour-value,
was in reality, a hundred and fifty years before its time, analysing the
future-world of an advanced Capitalist society premised on the
knowledge-theory of value. [With the triumph of digital Capitalism, it
may well be that the proletarianization of knowledge-work is only about
to begin. If this is the case then Marx's theory of class struggle may
yet be awaiting its first moment of historical realization in a fateful
struggle over the falling rate of (digital) profit and the exploitation
of knowledge-value]{.underline}. From the exploitation of industrial
labour to the struggle over knowledge-value, understanding the digital
future is in its Marxian past.

From Dead Labour to Virtual Knowledge

[Digital Capitalism is focused on the struggle over the emancipation of
knowledge-value from embodied knowledge: its genealogy, its circulation
as a generalized medium of cybernetic exchange, and its final
appearance, in the residual form **not of dead labour, but of dead
knowledge.**]{.underline}

In exactly the same way that labour functioned in industrial Capitalism
both as an embodiment of use-value and as the dominant valueform of
exchange-value, [knowledge functions in digital Capitalism as a
regulator of use-labour and exchange-labour. The dominant medium of
exchange of digital Capitalism, knowledge breaks forever with its
genealogical roots in individual consciousness, becoming instead the
**key value-form of cybernetic culture**. Not living knowledge with its
origins in individual subjectivity, embodied memory, or granulated
knowledge of specific labour practices, but virtual knowledge as the
dynamic medium of cybernetic culture.]{.underline}

[Virtual Knowledge? That's knowledge when it is first **invested with
the alien quality of value**, when knowledge first ceases to a matter of
individual consciousness, becoming instead a value-form, a circulating
medium within whose deflationary and inflationary flows the world is
**cyberneticized**, coded here with the binary logic of 0/1, there
spoken of as a 'digital nervous system]{.underline}.' In the same way
that labour was a measure of market value in modern Capitalism,
[knowledge is now a value of the measure of cyberneticity of digital
Capitalism. It is around the question of knowledge-value that the
fundamental class conflicts of digital Capitalism first organize,
sometimes in the daily repressed form of the domination of human
imagination by the performancerequirements of the virtual workplace,
at]{.underline} other times by open rebellions of a rising tide of
global counter-knowledge -- environmentalism, collective labour rights,
human rights -- against the 'free circulation' of knowledge-value, which
is to say of cybernetic Capital, so necessary for the continued
functioned of digital Capitalism.

Far from abandoning the generic pattern of use-value and exchangevalue
so endemic to the industrial mode of production, [**digital Capitalism
perpetuates, even intensifies, this pattern**, but at a higher level of
abstraction and generality. Severing the bond of use-knowledge and
individual subjectivity, digital Capitalism codes the question of
useknowledge in its deepest interiority. What once may have accurately
been described as **psychological repression now** takes the form of a
gradual constriction of knowledge to a **doubled code of use**. On the
one hand, knowledge that is instrumentally useful for the seamless
insertion of human flesh into the high-performance speed of digital
culture, and on the other, codes of use that are only apparently
transgressive]{.underline}. Virtual knowledge and abuse knowledge, both
contained as simultaneously explosive and domesticated tendencies in the
same body. 'Be serious' and 'be fake' as the doubled sign of the
knowledge-worker fully prepared for fast integration into the axiomatic
of digital Capitalism. With instrumental (digital) knowledge, the body
is plugged into the disciplinary network of careerism. [With (cultural)
abuse value, the body touches at a distance that which has been
forgotten in the interfacing of human and machine flesh: **libidinal
pleasures, human memory, symbolic exchange**. All these are
simultaneously retrieved in a (cultural) way that immediately shuts down
the anxiety of that which has been forgotten]{.underline}. It is 'be
fake' culture: the appropriation of the original ecstasy spirit of rave
culture by the corporate cultural axiomatic, the assimilation of
sometimes ghetto, sometimes prison, rap culture for the ersatz
entertainment of white suburban boys. [Economically, useknowledge in the
digital axiomatic **binds human flesh to the digital nervous system**.
Culturally, digital use-knowledge is about the cynicism of
forgetfulness.]{.underline}

Connectivity and forgetfulness: that is the paradoxical condition of
virtual knowledge in the ruling capitalist axiomatic.

[It is now clear that the essential result of the **total unreflexive
expansion of these globalizing technologies** under the tutelage of the
American state over the course of the last twenty years has been the
more or less apocalyptic crash of the global economy which was never
governed by value rationality, but rather operated on the basis of
mindless principles of economic struggle]{.underline}, such as
competitive advantage. However, to imagine this crash somehow signals
the end of Americanism and that Obama will be presented with a clean
slate on which to build a more socialistic America is, I think, a
mistake since the standard view of the Chicago School economic thinkers
would be to regard the current economic chaos in posthuman terms by
suggesting that what has happened over the course of the last year or so
is best represented by the image of the personal computer re-booting
itself after receiving the essential software update that the credit
bubble was over-inflated and needed to burst in order for the economy to
start to expand in future. The idea that we should tamper with the
economy on the basis of the essential re-boot, and think in humanistic
terms about the effects of the re-start on the world's human population,
would be lost on a thinker such as Milton Friedman (2002), who would
assert the need to let the economy work itself out of the downturn,
simply because he was possessed by the apocalyptic spirit of technology
that has become normal in the Americanized world[. Unfortunately for the
human population of the planet, the modern / postmodern age has been,
and continues to be, defined by the **dominance of the spirit of
technology** in ways that stretch far beyond the economic theories of
Friedman and the Chicago School thinkers and are perhaps better
illustrated by Heidegger's (1977) theory of completed nihilism that
describes a world totally possessed by **instrumental
reason**.]{.underline}

[Despite the dire warnings of the prophets of technological dystopia
such as Heidegger we remain unable to really conceive of the value of
organic life vis-à-vis the vitality of technology because we are
**infused by the spirit of the machin**e that has no purpose beyond the
endless reproduction of its most basic function to work]{.underline}. As
Kroker (2003) illustrates in his The Will to Technology, [the prophets
of the technological future]{.underline}, such as Marx, Nietzsche, and
Heidegger, understood that the machine, which is transformed into
Deleuze and Guattari's war machine in Wilson's work, [has no thought,
philosophy, or reason. It simply works for the sake of working and
ensuring that it continues to works in the future]{.underline}. In
Kroker's view this image of what Deleuze and Guattari call the
mecanosphere was predicted by Marx, who advanced the notion of
circulation, Nietzsche, who made the idea of the will central to this
thought, and Heidegger, who linked Marx to Nietzsche in his theory of
completed technological nihilism that simply wills the will that wills
itself and so on. However, we know that this is not the end of the
story. Akin to Kroker (2006), who shows that [the closed circle of
completed nihilism produces a mythical resurrection effect that pushes a
primitive God who hires and fires and sort winners from losers centre
stage, Wilson explains that the total expansion of the **supercapitalist
war machine** through the various scalings of global space-time produces
a **utopian moment of convulsive pleasure** comparable to the mystical
union with an omniscient tech-no God for a post-Nietzschean nihilistic
universe.]{.underline}

This is a truly apocalyptic event in Wilson's view because [the
sensation of **anorganic mechanistic joy** is the product of the
realization of a ghoulish utopia-dystopia of **total control or
over-determination** which sees the supercapitalist machine start to
threaten the elimination of organic life itself in favor of a new brand
of post-organic cybernetic life that does not suffer from any of the
imperfections or malfunctions of its organic predecessor]{.underline}.
In this situation the war function and the state function of
supercapitalism are merged in the form of a violent control mechanism
set on over-determining organic life by [transforming it into code that
can easily flow through the imaginary body of the globalized
communications network in quantums]{.underline} that are equivalent to
both basic financial and telecommunications data. Under these
conditions, where organic life itself is under threat from the spirit of
technology, we have entered the realm of Agamben's (1998) state of
exception where there is no rule of law, but that made by those in
executive power who manage the endless unfolding of the supercapitalist
machine.

For Wilson (2008a), [we are currently living in the Americanized
supercapitalist state of technological second nature where we are
totally exposed to the coding mechanisms of state power]{.underline}. In
Agamben's work this means that the liberal individual is completely open
to construction through discourse and that they can, therefore, easily
be reduced to a state of bare life by stripping away their legal
identity. However, Wilson's postmodern, surrealistic, take on the
significance of [the new **coding technologies** of the supercapitalist
state takes this Foucauldian theory a step further]{.underline}. In his
view, [the contemporary supercapitalist empire, which is in the process
of reducing everything and everybody to the status of code, deconstructs
and reconstructs the individual as either normal or pathological on the
basis of their sociological and biological identity that flows through
the globalized communication network as streamed data]{.underline}. At
this point the individual, who has already been reduced to the status of
a quantum of economic power by the Hobbesian / Lockean logic of the
supercapitalist system, is totally surveilled by the normalizing power
structures implicit in the Americanized global communication network.

In many respects this vision of a total system that covers every
conceivable scaling on the planet, reaching from the global level of
networked communications to the micro-biological level of individual
genetic code, represents Foucauldian (2008) biopower in its ultimate
form. [What the contemporary American supercapitalist war machine
achieves through the reduction of the individual to digital data is the
**complete immersion of humanity** into a technological coding system
that simply works by endlessly circulating information.]{.underline} The
difference between this Americanized biopolitical machine and what
Roberto Esposito (2008) calls the archetypal biocracy of modernity,
Nazism, is that the Nazi machine was never able to globalize its model
of normality and pathology because its central mechanism for reducing
humanity to the status of bare life, the camp, remained at an
experimental level that required the relatively primitive industrial
production of corpses, rather than the system we live with today which
creates postindustrial postmodern Muslims or muselmänner through the
reduction of humanity to the status of code. In this respect Nazism was
nowhere near as effective in achieving the normalization of humanity as
the contemporary American supercapitalist machine because its mechanism
for creating robotic men relied on brutal violence and the systematic
humiliation of the embodied human.

We know that the American system sometimes slips back into the same
logic, because we have all seen the images from Abu Ghraib, but these
kind of events represent a primitive or, in Wilson's Lacanian language,
real form of punishment that the supercapitalist war machine would
prefer to avoid where possible, simply because it understands that
[surveillance and normalization through data is a far more effective
means of ensuring that humanity is perfectly streamed through the
channels of technological mecanosphere than ritual humiliation ever
could. However, the supercapitalist machine is **not a static system**
that simply turns over endlessly]{.underline} because the effect of the
closure of mechanical circuit is the production of a new mythological
subject that functions to make the process of total robotization
bearable. [What this means is that somewhere in the realization of the
total technological system, where the global scale is the micro scale of
data that streams across the smooth spaces of the world communication
network]{.underline}, we encounter the real end of history in the
emergence of a kind of metaphysical temporal loop, which connects the
contemporary supercapitalist machine to ancient cosmological notions of
the micro-macrocosm that showed how man was intimately related to the
universe, and, as a consequence, the violent closure of the circuit of
history running from ancient Greece to postmodern America, with the
result that humanity is thrown back into prehistory and mythology.

[This is what Kroker (2006) means by quantum culture because what it
illustrates is the way in which the surrealistic looping of history
creates a new space of **techno-mysticism** based on notions of the kind
of apocalyptic rapture popular in contemporary America (Pfohl 2006). But
in the new American techno-apocalypse it is not simply that the chosen
few vanish into the mystical body of Christ, because this pulp version
of the story is far too close to traditional Old Testament thought, but
rather that the totally **immersed, totally coded, body** of the
normalized individual is overcome by the fantasy of the bioengineered
new man who never wears out and never passes away]{.underline}. In this
sci-fi fantasy, which is, in my view, the hard core or real of
contemporary supercapitalist ideology, [the new man]{.underline}, a kind
of bioengineered Nietzschean übermensch, [resides in a strange
techno-utopia, a new Heaven on Earth characterized by immortality and a
culture of endless life, where everybody and everything simply
works.]{.underline}

#### Prefer the perm -- anticoding against the will to technology is inherently a psychoanalytic enterprise that overcomes technological death and joyless states

**Featherstone 10** (Mark Featherstone PhD - Lecturer in Sociology at
Keele University, "Death-Drive America: On Scott Wilson's Vision of the
Cultural Politics of American Nihilism in the Age of Supercapitalism",

<https://fastcapitalism.uta.edu/7_1/featherstone7_1.html>, MG)

[Given the addition of the notion of joy, Wilson's thesis is **not**
simply that a kind of sensuous violence pervades contemporary American
culture, and that this is paradoxically the product of a repressive
Puritan society, but rather that **the fusion of religion and technology
in America creates a limit situation** defined by perfect mechanization
that recalls the mythic state of **joyess rapture** where the chosen
people leave their fleshy earthbound bodies behind and ascend towards
the heavens to become one with God.]{.underline} It is through reference
to this thesis, which recalls Achille Mbembe's (2003) work on
necropolitics, that Wilson shows how [America has evolved a mystical
culture of negation, where technological death and destruction is
**necessary for the elevation of particular humans to a joyess new
state**]{.underline}. What is more is that this runs parallel to the
Islamic fundamentalists' apocalyptic cult of death of the suicide
bomber, which transforms the ghoulish spectacle of the exploding body
into a cause for celebration. That is to say that in much the same way
that the Islamic fundamentalist body explodes when it reaches the joyess
state of maximum intensity represented by the condition of martyrdom
before God, [the American techno body pushes towards the limit condition
of organic death through a culture of techno-theology that aspires to
reach the mystical state of oneness with the divine through a state of
perfect mechanization that would render the fleshy body obsolete and
signal the emergence of posthuman cybernetic man.]{.underline}

Given that this psychocultural apocalyptic structure has, as Kroker
(2006) shows, been central to American thought from the very beginning
illustrates why it will not be enough for Obama to simply turn back to
multilateral politics and away from the empire talk of Bush II. In
Kroker's theory of American postmodern ideology, what happened under
Bush II is that the ancient Old Testament Puritanism of the original
settlers came back to enchant the postmodern techno-politics of
post-Berlin Wall America that was already gripped by the messianic
language of the end of history. [Thus, the thinkers who inform Kroker's
vision of the America of Bush II are Einstein and Weber who illustrate
the possibility of a quantum culture where religion and techno-reason
fuse to form an **apocalyptic complex** that is endlessly thrown back to
the future in search of salvation]{.underline}. It is this image of
techno-Puritan America that Wilson (2008a; 2008b) extends in his books
through French theory, with the added value that the psychoanalytic
basis of his work may [provide some way out of the psychological complex
of quantum culture through the recognition of the way the compulsion of
repeat sustains the bipolarity of Americanism. In other words, through
recognition it may be possible to work through and eventually overcome
the condition of bipolarity that currently means that the
conservative-paranoid line through Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan, and Bush
II will never end.]{.underline} This is, essentially, the therapeutic
model that sustains the Freudian-Lacanian theory that Wilson employs in
his books to explain the structure of the order of joy that he believes
organizes American culture.

[In order to extend this psychoanalytic model to an analysis of American
cultural politics Wilson makes use of **Lacan's three registers of the
imaginary**, which usually refers to the subject's imagined self, the
symbolic order, which relates to the systems of language and culture
that structure human reality, and the real]{.underline}, which Lacan
employs to explain the hard core of organic existence that can never be
represented by either the imaginary or the symbolic order and persists
on the outer edge of human perception. Wilson employs [this triadic
structure of the imaginary, the symbolic order, and the real to refer to
the body of global capitalism, the state, and the general economy of war
and expenditure]{.underline}. In his Lacanian complex, then, [the
imaginary is represented by the **totality of global capitalism**, the
symbolic order is reflected in the state that provides significance and
**codes the image of the global economy**, and the real is embodied by
the practices of **war, violence, and expenditure** understood in the
widest sense]{.underline}. Regarding the fusions between the three
registers, Wilson explains that economy and war meet in the explosion of
joyful immanence linked to destruction and consumption, [war and state
collide in the production of the mode of anorganic joy related to
perfected mechanization, and the state and economy meet in the event of
the symbolization of empire.]{.underline}

The nightmarish picture of neo-liberal America that emerges over the
course of the first chapter of The Order of Joy (2008a) is, therefore,
one of a state set on the total domination of global space-time through
the endless expansion of a martial economic model that is based on that
mechanistic consumption of organic matter and is for this reason totally
impervious to human reason. While Kroker (2006) paints a similarly bleak
picture of American empire in his outstanding companion piece to Born
Again Ideology , The Will to Technology (2003), through the use of Marx,
Nietzsche, and Heidegger, Wilson fast forwards through Kroker's
essential texts Capital (1990), Thus Spoke Zarathustra (2003a), and The
Question Concerning Technology (1977), until he reaches Deleuze and
Guattari's (1972; 1984) books on capitalism and schizophrenia, which
become the core texts for his work on contemporary Americanism. In
respect of the use of Deleuze and Guattari to conceptualize the rise of
empire there is nothing particularly new in Wilson's work, because Hardt
and Negri (2000) and to a lesser extent Retort (2005) make use of the
core thesis of Anti-Oedipus (1972) and A Thousand Plateaus (1984) to
understand processes of globalization. But I think that what sets
Wilson's treatment apart from these texts is the depth of the textual
relation he establishes between the works of the French schizoanalysts
and the condition of Americanism.

Similar to the thesis explained by Kroker in The Will to
Technology (2003) and Born Again Ideology (2006), The Order of the
Joy (2008a) shows how [the American war machine expands in order to
colonize global space-time on the basis of a ballistic version of
Puritanism that we can trace back to the original settlers]{.underline},
but also the core political theorists of America, such as Thomas Hobbes
(1982) and John Locke (2003). We know Hobbes employed the new physics of
Galileo to conceive of the early modern economy in abstract terms of
competing forces, trajectories, and lines of flight that needed minimal
regulation in order to ensure that collisions between the human
embodiments of those forces continued to be objectified in economic
terms and did not break through the thin crust of civilization to
restart the natural war of all against all (Spragens 1973). The next
step took place when Locke located Hobbes's abstract model of economy in
America, the tabula rasa of the new world which was perfectly suited to
carrying a metaphysical theory of economy, and began [the long history
of the mechanization, or **technologization**, of man through his theory
of property that extended to the idea of the estranged possessive
individual who owns his own body as an objective source of labor power
to be gainfully employed in the world]{.underline} (Macpherson 1962).
Given the theoretical model that the English political philosophers left
America, which enabled the understanding of men as abstract economic
quantums best understood through reference to the new physics of
movement that conceived of reality as a smooth space characterized by
competing quantums of matter in motion, and money that stands in for
some other object and only finds value in relation to other values, it
is clear how the possessive individual could be conceived of in terms of
a piece of hard metal that was endlessly on the move and was meaningless
beyond its relation to the environment that would simply either allow or
disallow future movement. Although my view is that the political
philosophies of Hobbes and Locke may be seen to inform the development
of Americanism on a deep philosophical level, Wilson skips the English
masters and leaps straight to Deleuze and Guattari and in particular
their idea of the war machine to illuminate the condition of postmodern
America. In his view [the purpose of the war machine, which represents
the fusion of economy, state, and war in American empire, is
to **brand reality**, where the practice of branding simultaneously
refers to the ancient process of marking property and the postmodern
practice of image manipulation in order to stimulate consumer desire,
and code the flows of capital as they pass through space-time in order
to continually construct and reconstruct the endlessly deconstructing
economic imaginary.]{.underline}

This is where war enters Wilson's system. The practice of war paves the
way for flows of fast capital by deconstructing traditional territorial
structures in order that new capitalist structures may be constructed in
the image of the globalized capitalist body without organs and the state
may oversee the construction of the correct essential infrastructure to
establish connections between the new virgin territory and the wider
imperial network. Hardt and Negri (2000) make the same point in
their Empire, suggesting that the key role of the American military
machine is to develop smooth space for capitalism to flow through, and
Retort (2005) employ the concept of military neo-liberalism to show how
the American military machine is led by the principle of economic need
in order to first open up and second protect new markets essential for
the maintenance of the heated up global consumer credit society. That
this heated up consumer model crashed while I was reading Wilson's books
illustrates his point that the reason global space-time has become a
battleground of competing economic interests is that the traditional
master signifier of international relations, the balance of power, which
had held since the end of World War II in the form of nuclear
deterrence, collapsed with the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union leaving
the globalizing technologies of finance, telecommunications, and the
American military machine free to colonize global space-time without
human reason or reflexivity.

### 2AC\-\--AT: Settler Colonialism

#### The pandemic flipped the script -- the world has gone digital and their alt obscures settler colonial violence as well as making collective indigenous political struggle impossible absent the aff

**Kroker** and Kroker **21** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and
adjunct professor of political science at the University of Victoria,
Marilouise Kroker - feminist scholar, publisher, editor, writer,
theorist, and performance artist, "Technologies of the New Real",
University of Toronto Press, Pages 3-6, October 2021, MG)

Ironically, the winter months preceding the pandemic were just the
opposite of isolation and social distancing. [As part of a **collective
political struggle** during the winter, many of us in British Columbia
(BC) and elsewhere were involved in an active alliance with youth and
elders involved in Indigenous resurgence and environmental activists to
protest the armed occupation of Indigenous territories]{.underline} by
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in support of aggressive
pipeline expansion. Like an epochal rip in the fabric of normal time and
space, [the provincial Parliament Buildings in Victoria, BC, were
surrounded by a large **Indigenous youth encampment**, vibrant with the
lighting of sacred fires, drumming, inspiring speeches, and a field of
red dresses symbolizing murdered and missing Indigenous women, all
carried out with a **spirit of love**, not violence, and with very
courageous, very determined resolve on the part of the Indigenous youth
and elders]{.underline}. I may have been teaching a seminar on the
politics of race and power by day, with that haunting trilogy of Black
Skin/White Masks, Red Skin/White Masks, and Brown Skin/ White Masks, 2
but by night many students were at the encampment in active solidarity
with Indigenous youth, while others responded to frequent appeals during
the night-time hours to come to the Legislature to help protect the
Indigenous youth from possible police violence[. What I witnessed over
the winter was a glimpse into the possibility of a more just future
traced out in all its **social creativity**, political courage, and
profound ecological understanding by **Indigenous thought and
practice**, and by strong alliances between Indigenous youth and many
other young people conscious of the **historical injustices of settler
colonialism**.]{.underline}

[**Then, the pandemic struck**, with all its globalized panic fear and
political cynicism. The darkness of the pandemic spring was just **the
opposite of the lightness of winter politics**]{.underline}. Watching
President Trump's daily televised orgies of unconstrained narcissism and
spasms of self-pity interspersed with mean-spirited scapegoating and
cynical lies, all applauded by an enormous popular following howling the
deep rage of their discontent, I was reminded of Deleuze and Guattari's
description of [the continuing power of seductive appeals to the
suicidal death drive of fascism.3 Here the political virus of right-wing
populism, fuelled by panic fear and intense anxiety over the loss of
jobs in the very real-life context for many people in the contemporary
economy of work or starve, seeks to attach itself to the host cell of
the television audience, releasing its genetic instructions and then
waiting as the host cell reproduces the virus, whether expressed in the
form of angry white male hysteria, scapegoating of Asians, border
violence against asylum seekers, or studied popular silence concerning
the cynical hijacking of relief funds by large corporations in the
United States and by carbon-heavy energy companies in
Canada.]{.underline}

[The immediate consequences of viral contagion are dire: **the eclipse
of the social and the death of politics**. And there's something else as
well -- something now present as a faint intimation of things to come on
the horizon of perception but then quickly inflating into a really
existent reality. That reality is **bio-fascism**. The signs are
everywhere]{.underline}. A friend from New York texts me to express her
concern about how quickly people are eager to surrender civil liberties
in the face of the pandemic. She points to the Wall Street Journal with
its reports on the alliance between Apple and Google in perfecting
contact tracing. It's definitely a useful medical tool at the present
moment, but after the pandemic, contact tracing is potentially a vast
extension of the power of corporate surveillance over individual privacy
for purposes of targeted relational advertising and, for the national
security state, an emblematic breakthrough in power over the bodies of
its citizens. Moralized first in the name of public health but later
likely to be made permanent in the name of national security and virtual
capitalism, contact tracing could well turn out to be a leading talisman
of bio-fascism, with the workplace future likely to become an experiment
in bio-politics -- segregation of the population, temperature taking,
sudden quarantines, rule by emergency decree. It's [all of these things,
while the virtual capitalism of the ruling financial corporations views
this moment as a convenient time to actualize what has already taken
place -- the shedding of unnecessary living labour once commerce has
fully transitioned to remote labour in the age of the gig economy. Here,
surging gun sales and panic hoarding are only symptomatic signs of the
death of the social and the eclipse of politics, and all of this
disintegration moves to the]{.underline} [background]{.underline} music
of the coming of age of Bob Dylan's dirge, "Murder Most Fowl."

[Along with these developments is the assumption that one lasting
consequence will be to suddenly **accelerate technological tendencies**
that, until now, have remained masked in society. Certainly, the impact
of social distancing and physical isolation has volatized the appeal, if
not everyday necessity, of online services]{.underline}: for shopping,
shipping, and surfing. It's as if the social economy has suddenly split
in two, with face-to-face businesses shuttered, slowed down with
requirements for social distancing, or literally bio-pits for possible
viral infections. The sudden silence in the streets of everyday
business -- stores, restaurants, malls, offices -- contrasts sharply
with the economic clamour in all the Amazons, Apples, and Googles of the
digital world. Here, what appears to be happening is a decisive movement
of the commodity form -- the essence of all capitalist transactions --
from the face-to-face market of the offline economy to the streamed
services of the virtual economy. Following the doubled ideology of
facilitation and command, virtual capitalism can so quickly triumph
because, at this moment of very real social crisis, it easily
facilitates the necessities and consumer choices of daily life, whether
for food, services, banking, medicine, or entertainment. [The question
remains: after the pandemic, will what was so quickly and massively
adopted by the population as a way of facilitating survival in the midst
of social distancing become a new order of economy, less a matter of
choice than a practical imperative imposed by the ruling virtual
corporations?]{.underline} Will offices repopulate, or will business
increasingly move essential services online? Will manufacturing plants
seek to restore previous levels of employment, or will factories take
advantage of this break in normal reality to speed up the transition
long underway towards the automated future of labour promised by
developments in artificial intelligence and robotics? [In other words,
what will be the future of life after the pandemic when the full
adoption of technologies of the new real suddenly introduces us to a
**future as socially unexpected and unpredicted as it was
technologically inevitable?**]{.underline}

This account provides an affective analogue to Innis's political
economy. Grant's passage, like much of his other writing, reads as a
threnody that reveals a resoundingly solipsistic moral imperative
expressed through a consolidating settler perspective. [This is also a
fascinating passage for the way in which it elegiacally construes the
forging of North America as an alienating "break" from "**the old and
the settled**" and a necessary estrangement with "the extremes of the
new land." Because the land did not---and could never---**belong to the
new settlers**, their identity **had to be moulded in wilful opposition
to the land**, which was subsequently seen as needing to be continually
conquered by the will of man. This inhospitable land thus serves an
important symbolic function in the national imaginary; its wildness is
that which needs to be perpetually (re)established, in order that it can
provide an embryonic "wild" against which **the will to technology**
(the rational-scientific imperative to tame and subjugate) can be
emphasized through juxtaposition.]{.underline}

The outer world was not the only terrain fundamentally altered by the
will to technology. A notion that comes up repeatedly through much of
these thinkers\' works is that [technology fundamentally structures our
**psyches and determines the way we think and relate to others**. For
Grant, technology is neither a neutral nor separate entity with which we
are able to choose how we wish to interact---an external \"playground\"
or \"orchard where we can always pick variegated fruit;\" instead,
technology \"**moulds us in what we are, not only at the heart of our
animality in the propagation and continuance of our species, but in our
actions and thoughts and imaginings**\" (Technology 15).]{.underline}
While Grant was perhaps the most pessimistic in his understanding of the
colonizing potential of technology, other thinkers shared his idea that
technology had the force to shape consciousness for better or worse.

The Toronto School of Communication, an influential colloquium of
interdisciplinary scholars at the University of Toronto whose core
included Innis, McLuhan, and Eric Havelock, were joined by their
intersecting interests on the ways that [communication technologies
**shaped our psychology** (de Kerckhove) as well as the "social and
cultural infrastructure of societies"]{.underline} (Marchessault,
Marshall 108). Innis, in as early as his 1923 history of the CPR, was
already putting forth the idea that technology, far from being something
externally located, was in fact \"the necessary condition and lasting
consequence of Canadian existence\" (Kroker 94). While McLuhan is
probably the most eminent of the group for his general postulations
regarding [the psychic/psychological impact of electronic technologies,
he also traced the psychological impact resulting from the
**technological incursions into the landscape**]{.underline}. In his
posthumously published essay, \"Canada and Counter-Environment,\" one of
his rare undertakings of the Canadian question, McLuhan argues that [the
North American inheritance of the \"war on empty wilderness\" from its
**settler ancestors** continues to shape the Canadian spirit. A century
of life on the frontier produced a population defined by their
**antagonistic relations** with the brutality of nature, relations that
resulted in the forging of a particular type in whom was necessitated
"initiative amidst solitude" (75).]{.underline} "Like Wordsworth and
Thoreau," McLuhan further states, \"North Americans spend their time
scanning the environmental mystery, taking spins in the country instead
of spinning thoughts at home\" (79). What we can glean from these
theorists is that [Canadians are invariably marked---in body and
psyche---by the technologically conquest of the land. The **colonization
of the Indigenous inhabitants** of this land, meanwhile, was not a
matter that elicited equivalent consideration.]{.underline}

[Aside from determining external and internal landscapes, technology has
also come to be the often invisible lens through which Canadians see the
\"character\" of the nation as well as each other]{.underline}. As
Arthur Kroker argues, \"Canadian identity is, and always has been, fully
integral to the question of technology\" (12). It is important to think
about the functions served by the demonstration of Canadian identity
through technology. [Technological mediation allows the articulation not
only of romantic **settler-colonial attachment to idyllic landscapes**,
but also a determined will that is forged from the direct confrontation
with the wild. This is a fortitude which conceives its own survival as
indelibly linked to an overcoming of the landscape and its perilous
indeterminacy. We can see this in, for example, Grant\'s assertion that
the \"almost indomitable\" land incites a certain kind of (liberal)
subject and societal character; \"\[]{.underline}t\]he intense seasons
of the continental heartland needed a people who whatever else were not
flaccid. And these people not only forced commodities from the land, but
built public and private institutions of freedom and flexibility and
endurance\" (24). Canadian myths of origin centre not merely on the
wildness of the landscape in and for itself; rather, [wildness serves as
the verdant and receptive ground upon which to emphasize the exercise of
**over-determined technological will**]{.underline}

### 1AR\-\--AT: Settler Colonialism

While the preceding section considered the ways in which technology
shapes both external and internal landscapes, what follows is an attempt
to examine more extensively [the generative capacity of technology to
(re)produce bodies within the folds of nation, and the role of
technology in situating us in an historical narrative through rhetorics
of seduction. Not only is technology interjected into our **affective,
imaginative relationships with nation**, but it in fact plays a primary
role in generating and conducting these relationships in the first
place]{.underline}. Integral to this inquiry is an examination of how,
emboldened by origin myths centering on the confrontation of nature with
technological prowess, Canadians carry forth the embodiment and
reproduction of the will to technology.

A few years before Chief Dan George\'s delivered his indictment of the
colonial state during its one hundredth birthday, another George had
already sounded his ominous \"lament.\" George Grant\'s Lament for a
Nation, published in 1965, centred on what [the philosopher saw as the
inevitable casualties strewn across the path towards unbridled
technological advancement]{.underline}. In his famous treatise, Grant
mourns the sundering of ties to the European tradition of contemplation
inherited from the Greeks, and condemns what he observes to be the
willing surrender of Canadian sovereignty and keen embroilment in
America's imperial injustices in Vietnam. [The technological
imperative]{.underline}, against which Grant warned[, springs from the
\"crucible of pioneering of Protestant liberalism\" that produced
\"those uncomptemplative, and unflinching wills\" which in turn become
the **driving force of a technological society** (Technology 25). The
wellspring of the will to technology is the liberal faith in not merely
the creative capacity but also **necessity to conquer the landscape**,
overcome requisite obstacles, and create the world anew. Any excavation
of such an imperative would be incomplete without an examination of the
idealism that compels us towards this technological striving. Namely,
Grant points to the relationship between our mastery of the human and
non-human world and the perhaps paradoxical liberal discourse of
\"freedom\" and \"values\" with which this mastery becomes inextricably
entwined. Arguably, Grant begins to posit a significant affective
dimension to the technological will in his explanation that \"\[w\]hat
makes the drive to technology so strong is that it is carried on by men
who still **identify what they are doing with the liberation of
mankind**]{.underline}\" (Technology 27). He also maintains that it is
Canadians\' \"belief in progress through technique\" which is \"the
central cause of motion in their souls\" (Technology 64). In other
words, the drive towards technological mastery and imperial expansion is
rarely articulated through the naked language of capitalist accumulation
and power; rather, its efficacy and potency lies in its alignment with
individual freedom and unrestrained human potential.

[Given its underlying ethos, Grant sees the will to technology as
manifested in the imperial desire to **conquer and transform the world
through the scientific-rational conquering of chance**--- or the
\"desire to make the future by mastery, and the closing down of all
thinking which transcends calculation\" (Technology 40). Unsurprisingly,
this process involves the overcoming of the cruel indifference of the
external world---both in terms of body and]{.underline} nature. North
Americans according to Grant are, afterall, the heirs of a Calvinist
conviction that righteousness can be achieved by both body and nature
having been brought to submission. In this view, [human freedom is
actuated not only through its severance from nature, but also in the
form of **technologically determined incursion** into nature as separate
and external terrain. Further, the will to technology as way of knowing
determines the tenacious warrant with which the external terrain is
dominated; Grant]{.underline} writes, \"the technological society is not
for most North Americans, at least at the level of consciousness, a
\'terra incognita\' into which we must move with hesitation, moderation
and in wonder, but a comprehended promised land which we have discovered
by the use of calculating reason and which we can ever more completely
inherit by the continued use of calculation\" (Technology 28).

Furthermore, Grant observes that the [rise of the homogenisation under
American **technological imperialism**---which he diagnoses as the
threat of continentalism---results in the **rationalization and
instrumentalization of culture**, as well as what can be characterized
as the tragic clamping down of the sense of wonder and awe with which
one can engage with the world]{.underline}. To return to the passage of
Grant\'s quoted in the preceding paragraph, [the will to technology
creates a \"**comprehended promised land**,\" a space stripped of wonder
and replaced by an unrelenting drive towards technological advancement.
It can be argued that, alongside this loss of wonder, is the
proliferation of further myths regarding freedom and progress, as well
as the reproduction of liberal capitalist faith in the individual human
capacity \"**to shape the world as we see it**\" (Technology
114).]{.underline}

When [politically marginalised refugees]{.underline} set out to resist
their unequal position in a particular political context, [they often
organise their protests in a loud, vocal manner]{.underline}. By
expressing their resistance through loud outcries of dissent, [refugees
attempt to make their political claims for equality heard as clearly and
as widely as possible]{.underline}. [These kinds of protests **can
sometimes be effective** in gaining public attention]{.underline}.
Occasionally, however, refugees organise protests without recourse to
loud vocality. Sometimes egalitarian refugee protests emerge in a mode
that can be characterised as silent action. In silent political action,
refugees express their resistance in a non-verbal, embodied way. Refugee
activists' bodies communicate politically in silent acts of resistance.
Silent politics often emerges in restricted, prisonlike conditions, such
as detention centres where the persons confined within these places do
not have access to public spaces where they could organise loud, vocal
protests. Sometimes, however, refugees who succeed in entering a public

[Silent protests, such as the two refugees' protest in Finland, can be
described as expressions of a certain kind of **political 'spirit'**.
This spirit can be defined in many ways. It can be named, for example,
the spirit of autonomy, the spirit of freedom or the spirit of
equality.]{.underline} In On Revolution (1963), Hannah Arendt discusses
the idea of the revolutionary spirit, which is the spirit of actualising
something new politically. In Arendtian theory, this spirit appears as
the urge and courage for miraculous political action that initiates
something new in the world (Arendt, 1958, 1963).

[An alternative way of describing the spirit of politics would be to
call it a '**revolting spirit'**. This definition would perhaps capture
something of the Zapatista conception of political refusal as an
expression of that something that in us intuitively says **no to
domination**]{.underline} (Holloway and Pel´aez, 1998: 184--5).
[Expressions of a revolting spirit can be politically
meaningful.]{.underline} We must here argue against, for example, Slavoj
Zizek, who attacks as a basic weakness of many contemporary political
protests the fact that they remain mere expressions of rage and, as
such, cannot result in positive programs of socio-political change. The
problem, Zizek argues, is that ['(t)hey express a spirit of revolt
without revolution' (Zizek, 2012: 78). As the spirit of political
subversion, however, and of the active representation of autonomous
definitions of the world, the revolting spirit can be politically
meaningful. This spirit can materialise in acts of resistance that
powerfully bring into view the oppressiveness of the prevailing
aesthetic political order and point toward the possibility of realising
a more egalitarian one.]{.underline} The revolting spirit can thus
indeed be just another name for the revolutionary spirit: the spirit of
actualising something new politically. Refugee protests are examples of
the emergence of the revolting, revolutionary spirit in contemporary
political contexts.

Refugee protests expressing this spirit undermine the aesthetic
sensibility of prevailing aesthetic refugee regimes. The persistent
reoccurrence of protests led by this spirit holds the potential for
bringing about continual aesthetic revolutions in the sensibility of law
and politics.

[Especially silent protests can initiate such **aesthetic revolutions**.
[Against the backdrop of]{.mark} what could be described as frameworks
of **[loud]{.mark} representative [vocalisation]{.mark}** and the noise
pollution of statist rhetoric, [they emerge as a radical, subversive
form of political communication]{.mark}. The refugees' protest in
Finland, for example, as a verbally silent, **embodied act of political
communication**, appeared as a potentially subversive act. In the
statist context of citizen-centred politics and a representative speech
system privileging loud extrovert modes of verbal speech, its silent
reaching out had a **special quieting effect**.]{.underline}

[Silent protest acts by politically marginalised people can sometimes
succeed in making their audience speechless as well. A silent act can
cause a pause in the midst of a loud message-filled reality and it can
be experienced as something meaningful. In these moments of silence, the
logic of prevailing **aesthetic orders of politics can be sensed anew**.
When many such silences take place simultaneously, a broader, common
subversion in the aesthetic orders can start to evolve. The silent
political act that brought about these many silences can then be
understood as an aesthetically revolutionary act.]{.underline}

[^1]: There are some debaters who have become exceptionally good at
    meshing poetry with competitive debate. I would point out Nader
    Hadad from Cal State Long Beach and Lana Langsweirdt from the
    University of Vermont as debaters who have both become powerful
    poets and good debaters (who use poetry in their rounds).

[^2]: For more on this see Gordon Mitchell's (1998) article on the
    pedagogy of public debates. He outlines a number of debate
    initiatives that have used public debate outside of the policy
    debate realm.

[^3]: Gilles Deleuze writes about Nietzsche's unique take on the will to
    power. "The will to power alone is the one that wills, it does not
    lend itself be delegated or alienated to another subject, even to
    force. (49).

[^4]: Detournement is most well known from the Canadian magazine
    *Adbusters*, who re-popularized Debord's work in the 1990s doing
    mock-ups of popular advertisements.

[^5]: In my theorizing about this essay, I contemplated including a
    reference to Ernest Callenbach's novel *Ecotopia*. In this novel,
    Callenbach's protagonist enters a closed off zone of ecologically
    sustainable territories in the Pacific Northwest of the former-USA.
    One of the most hotly contested differences between the protagonist
    and the Ecotopians is a game. The Ecotopians use ritual physical
    combat to explore the visceral experience that is part of humans.
    Young men will gather and fight each other with spears. It seems as
    though there is a good comparison between my proposal of the
    potlatch and Callenbach's war games. Both are visceral games that
    are intended to alter the state of the participants. In Ecotopia,
    the war game is the turning point of the book, where the
    protagonist, torn between two worlds appreciates the Ecotopian world
    and begins to consider living in Ecotopia. I would hope that my
    reference to the potlatch would have a similar affect.

[^6]: Debord was a committed life-long abuser of drugs and alcohol, and
    he certainly would have appreciated gifts of these sorts.
