In a 1990 interview in !e Postcolonial Critic, Gayatri Spivak described
how she related her theoretical positions to her more 'political'
interventions. She argued that although -- theoretically and
intellectually -- she was opposed to 'universalism' or 'essentialism',
it was necessary to make a 'strategic choice'2 when intervening
politically. !is strategic choice involved recognising that since the
language of universalism or essentialism was the language in which
political debates were conducted, one had to adopt this language in
order to make an intervention. !us, she 'spoke of universality because
universality was in the air from the other side in the talk of female
discourse \... and since I believe that one shouldn't throw away things
but use them, strategically \... perhaps here was an item which could be
used as a universal signi#er'.3 !is position -- that anti-essentialists
should not simply discard essentialism, but must instead deploy
essentialist arguments in concrete political contexts -- has come to be
known as 'strategic essentialism'.4 Yet although such a position has an
evident attraction, one can immediately imagine several problems with
it. !e #rst problem is when one should use essentialism and when one
should not. Spivak's argument simply seems to be that there are some
times that essentialism should be used and other times when it should
not, what is lacking is any broader criterion as to its use or non-use.
!e second problem is that of legitimation. Is it really the case that we
should always engage in debates purely on the terms that we #nd them? In
so doing, do we not risk winning the particular argument, whilst at the
same time legitimating those broader structures that we wish to
undermine? !e combination of these two arguments points to the third
objection we can raise. If one uses essentialism whenever it is
e\$ective to do so, having no concern as to whether one's behaviour is
legitimating that very language, in what sense is one's behaviour
di\$erent from anyone else's? In other words, does strategic
essentialism, in this sense, not simply collapse into essentialism? !ese
problems stem from the fact that, notwithstanding its characterisation,
Spivak's position is not one of strategic essentialism at all. Although
her position clearly is one that pays attention to the pragmatic
dimensions of political interventions, these dimensions are con#ned
purely to the short term. Whilst she gives an account of how immediate
arguments might be won, she gives no consideration of how to recon\"gure
the terms of these arguments, thus undermining essentialism itself. At
best, her position is one of tactical essentialism, paying little or no
attention to the deeper or longer term aspects of the critique of
essentialism. !is is not simply a matter of semantics. In con\"ating
strategy and tactics -- a distinction that will be explored more fully
below -- Spivak completely subsumes the former into the latter, with the
essential outcome that all matters of 'e\$ectiveness' are reduced to
purely short term considerations. **[What relevance does this have for
international law? [Whilst international law has always been a central
feature of international politics, it is only in recent years that it
has become a regular feature]{.mark} in the news media, and a more
important part of 'everyday' political life.]{.underline}** **[[This has
been particularly evident in the centrality that international law has
come to assume in the construction and contestation of foreign
policy]{.mark}.]{.underline}**5 !ere have been various moments that were
especially important in this process:
**[[beginning]{.underline}]{.mark}** perhaps **[[with Kosovo]{.mark} and
culminating in the War on Terror and the 2003 Iraq war.]{.underline}**
**[[Most recently, debates around]{.mark}]{.underline}** the killing of
Bin Laden and **[[the NATO intervention in Libya have been conducted in
fiercely juridical terms]{.underline}]{.mark}**.6 [**[For those scholars
and practitioners of international law who identify themselves as part
of the left this has raised considerable
problems]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[[The main question has been how to
intervene in these debates in a distinctively left or critical
fashion]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[This is linked to the more general
question of how -- or even whether -- the left can utilise international
law in such a way as to advance the interests of the oppressed and
exploited]{.underline}**.7 It is here that the above considerations on
Spivak become relevant. As will be argued below, Spivak's strategic
essentialism is a sophisticated articulation of the basic logic that
underpins a great deal of critical thinking on how to intervene in these
debates. The[se accounts rely on the idea that a 'strategic'
intervention has to be made into the existing debates, whilst focusing
almost exclusively on short term, tactical considerations. **Thus,
strategy has become systematically confused with tactics, resulting in
its exclusion from theoretical discourse.**]{.underline} **[Those same
problems]{.underline}** identified in Spivak's approach **[continually
resurface in critical legal scholarship]{.underline}**. This article
seeks to challenge the above position and construct an alternative
account of how critical international lawyers might intervene
politically. To this end, Section 2 of this article brie\"y reconstructs
the distinction between strategy and tactics. In Section 2.1 this is
achieved through examining the original context in which this
distinction was articulated, that of military theory. Section 2.2 turns
to a slightly di\$erent sphere -- that of political theory -- and
attempts to see how the originally military distinction has been
understood in political terms. Section 3 examines how the distinction
can illuminate the attempts of critical legal scholars to intervene in
political debates. In section 3.1 an attempt is made to imagine what a
strategic objective for critical legal theory might look like, through
examining the theoretical commonalities of some of its participants. !is
is followed by section 3.2 which uses the letter written by several
academics against the Iraq war as a lens to examine how critical
scholars have understood the relationship between strategy and tactics.
Here it will be argued that these writings have fallen into the trap
outlined above -- confusing strategy with tactics -- and ultimately end
up collapsing into liberalism. Section 3.3 argues that one of the
central elements of this position is that it erects a rigid dichotomy
between 'liberal legalism' and 'legal nihilism', in which liberal
legalism cannot help but seem attractive. Section 4 examines a number of
writers in the Marxist tradition, arguing that their understanding of
strategy allowed them to bridge the divide between liberal legalism and
legal nihilism. Finally, in section 5, the article puts forward a
speci#cally legal conception of the relationship between strategy and
tactics, developing a position of 'principled opportunism'. 2. !e
Anatomy of a Distinction 2.1. Politics as War Although today strategy is
perhaps seen as synonymous with the world of business, it has its
origins in what we might call military science, and continues to be a
central term in the contemporary military world. Indeed many of those
who used the terms 'strategy' or 'tactics' in describing politics were
in\"uenced directly by these military theorists.8 Accordingly, before
turning to the political usage of the term, it is wise to begin with how
these military theorists have dealt with these notions. Carl von
Clausewitz, one of the most in\"uential exponents of modern military
theory, de#ned strategy as: \[T\]he use of the engagement to attain the
object of the war \... It must therefore give an aim to the whole
military action. !is aim must be in accord with the object of the war.
In other words, strategy develops the plan of the war, and to the
aforesaid aim links the series of acts which are to lead to it; that is,
it plans the separate campaigns and arranges the engagements to be
fought in each of them.9 Strategy is -- in essence -- how it is that one
would #ght and win a war: connecting the various individual battles
together so as to achieve this broader objective. In contradistinction
to this is tactics, which is concerned with smaller and shorter term
matters. Tactics are concerned with how to win the individual battles
and engagements of which the war is composed.10 If we wish to translate
this metaphor into more general terms[, **[we might say that strategy
concerns the manner in which we achieve and eventually fulfil our long
term aims or objectives]{.underline}**,]{.mark} **[[whereas tactics
concerns the methods through which we achieve our shorter term aims or
objectives]{.underline}]{.mark}**. !e obvious conclusion here, and one
that will be important to bear in mind throughout this article, is that
when we talk of 'pragmatism' or 'effectiveness' it need not be referring
to only the immediate situation. As will be explored more fully below,
any tactical intervention will also have strategic consequences. !is
means that when thinking about e\$ectiveness, it is necessary to
understand the inherent relation between strategy and tactics.11 **[[In
so doing, the distinction allows us to consider how effective
particular]{.underline}]{.mark}** (seemingly 'short term'**[)
[interventions might be in the longer term]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The
very obvious difficulty here is that in practical terms it may be quite
dif- #cult to distinguish between the long term and the short term. !is
is particularly true in the case of political interventions. More than
this, however, temporality does not quite capture the distinction
between a 'battle' and a 'war'. Although it is clear that there are
temporal di\$erences between the two, there could be innumerable
examples of long battles or short wars. **[Instead, the difference
between]{.underline}** a battle and a war (and therefore **[between
tactics and strategy]{.underline}**) **[seems to turn on a structural
distinction, lying in the particular aims and objectives of the
different types of engagement]{.underline}**. Whilst the task of a
battle is generally simply to defeat a given enemy militarily, the task
of a war will be more complex, involving the disposition of forces,
decisions about whether some battles should even be fought (or whether
some ought to simply be lost) and complex political and diplomatic
aspects.12 [Of course this difference in kind generally does correspond
to a distinction between the long and the short term, but this does not
represent the 'essence' of the problem. As such, whilst temporality
remains an important part of the distinction, it cannot be the sole
factor underlying it.]{.underline} 2.2. Organic and Conjunctural
Accordingly, it is not the case that the particular way in which the
distinction operates in military terms can be directly mapped onto the
political and legal sphere. !is is especially true given that war is --
to quote Clausewitz again -- 'the continuation of policy by other
means'13. **[Despite this, there is a common thread running between
military and political theory on this subject, with political thinkers
sharing a similar understanding of strategy as operating in the 'long
term']{.underline}**. In order to understand how this has been
'translated', [it is useful to turn to Antonio Gramsci's distinction
between organic and conjunctural moments and the type of
'criticism']{.underline} that both entail: \[I\]n studying a structure,
it is necessary to distinguish between organic movements (relatively
permanent) from movements which may be termed "conjunctural" (and which
appear as occasional, immediate, almost accidental). [Conjunctural
phenomena too depend on organic movements to be sure, but they do not
have any very far-reaching historical significance**; they give rise to
a political criticism of a minor, day-to-day character, which has as its
subject top political leaders and personalities with direct governmental
responsibilities.**]{.underline} Organic phenomena on the other hand
give rise to socio-historical criticism, whose subject is wider social
groupings -- beyond the public #gures and beyond the top leaders.14
**[[Gramsci articulated this distinction]{.mark} -- in part -- in order
to understand the logic of strategic and tactical interventions in the
political sphere]{.underline}**.15 **[[In this account, strategy is
related to organic phenomena, that is to say those relationships which
are relatively permanent,]{.mark} [and serve as the basic]{.mark} or
fundamental [structure of the field in which the intervention is
made]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In terms of Marxist political economy, the
prime example of such a phenomenon would be the mode of production (for
instance feudalism or capitalism) and the relations of production of
which it is composed. Strategic questions are those that are addressed
at critiquing and overturning these relationships. Accordingly, we might
say that strategic interventions are 'revolutionary',16 inasmuch as they
address critiquing or abolishing the basic logic of the system.
Moreover, since they address relationships that operate at a broader and
less immediate level than other struggles, strategic decisions are
likely to be informed in a greater sense by 'theory' (hence Gramsci's
reference to 'socio-historic' criticism) as it becomes more important to
understand and unpack the logic of the system. However, these
considerations remain 'prudential' or 'pragmatic' inasmuch as they aim
at #nding the most e\$ective methods to achieve a goal. !e di\$erence is
simply that this goal is related to structural or systemic issues.
**[[By contrast tactics are concerned with conjunctural moments]{.mark},
that is to say those which are not structural in a direct sense.
[Tactics address those transitory conflicts and battles that occur in
the political sphere,]{.mark} which could be a whole range of different
issues[: from an individual election, to a particular protest]{.mark}
and so on.]{.underline}** Consequently, there is a sense in which, in
contrast to strategy, tactics would be more concerned with 'reform' than
with revolution,17 since tactics deals with those occurrences which do
not directly call the system into question. Of **[course, ta[ctics and
strategy do not exist in rigid isolation from each other.]{.mark} this
is because -- as above -- [any given act which has to be reckoned with
'tactically' will at the same time make up the broader pattern of
engagements to which strategy directs our
attention]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Equally, there are situations in which
the very 'dayto-day' issues may take on an immediately structural
character, meaning tactical decisions will be immediately strategic.
However, **[[these 'revolutionary' situations are in fact extremely
rare, occurring only in extraordinary historical conjunctures. For the
majority of time the distinction between strategy and tactics is a
necessary one because the critique of the basic structural logic of the
system is not identical with every day struggles within
it,]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and the critique of this structure is not
one that has an immediate appeal to the majority of
people.]{.underline}** !us, to go back to an earlier point[, **[the
distinction between strategy and tactics could be said to be a
consequence of advancing a 'revolutionary' critique in nonrevolutionary
times]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** !is is where the issue
of temporality returns, for whilst the distinction between strategy and
tactics is a structural one, in non-revolutionary times it will almost
always assume a temporal form. If the overturning of the social
structure is not immediately on the cards, it must become a long term
goal, whereas conjunctural issues necessarily operate in the shorter
term. Since the strategy and tactics distinction only makes sense in
non-revolutionary times, it follows that it will almost always appear in
a temporal form. To put it simply, we might say strategy concerns #nding
methods to achieve long term, systemic aims, whereas tactics concerns
#nding methods to achieve short term, conjunctural aims.
