# Queer IR

A lot of this appears confusing but most of the cards are really
straightforward if you read them fully. Good luck! -sam

Thank you very much resident K debater seiji for helping me with this
file so that it's coherent enough to put out \<3

A lot of these cards can be swapped/answered by fem IR stuff---so if
there's something you need that's not in here or if you would like to
use those cards it could be very helpful

There are a lot of things I have to say about a lot of cards in this

**The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of
America,** When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for
one people to **[[dissolve]{.underline}]{.mark}** the political bands
which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers
of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature
and of Nature\'s **[[God]{.underline}]{.mark}** entitle them, a decent
respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the
causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\--That
to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among
**[[Men]{.underline}]{.mark}**, deriving their just powers from the
consent of the governed, \--That whenever any Form of Government becomes
destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to
abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on
such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them
**[[shall]{.underline}]{.mark}** seem most likely to effect their Safety
and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long
established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and
accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to
**[[suffer]{.underline}]{.mark}**, while evils are sufferable, than to
right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the
same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it
is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to
provide new Guards for their future security.\--Such has been the
patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity
which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The
history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated
injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment
of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be
submitted to a candid world.

#### The aff's representation of IR is inherently implicated by gender and sexuality---the 'perverse homosexual' in opposition to the 'sovereign man'

**Weber 2016** (Cynthia Weber is a Professor of International Relations
at Sussex University, "*Queer International Relations -- Sovereignty,
Sexuality, and the Will to Knowledge"*, Chapter 3, Oxford University
Press, 2016, accessed 7/17/2022)//sfs

This chapter and the next argue that four **[figures that consistently
appear in]{.underline}** the **[discourse]{.underline}** of 'Western' /
global 'Northern' 'developed' states **[as perverse---the
'underdeveloped', the 'undevelopable', the 'unwanted immigrant', and the
'terrorist']{.underline}**---**[are among]{.underline}** the specific
(if surprising) **[articulations of the 'perverse homosexual' in
international relations.]{.underline}** These particular figurations of
the 'perverse homosexual' matter for transnational/ global queer studies
and international relation because **[they make possible (by being
opposed to) specific figurations of 'sovereign man' as '(neo) imperial
man' and as '(civilizationally) developed man'.]{.underline}** All of
these figurations of or against 'sovereign man' appear to arise out of
**[and]{.underline}** in turn **[produce]{.underline}** what Berlant and
Warner call **[heteronormativity]{.underline}**, 'the institutions,
structures of understanding, and practical orientations that make
heterosexuality seem not only coherent \... but also privileged' (1998,
548 n. 2). By tracing where, when, and how these 'perverse homosexuals'
are spoken of in past and ongoing colonial, imperial, and developmental
heteronormative discourses that incite them as a concern, stabilize them
as a problem, and regulate solutions to the problems they raise through
specific policies, these chapters analyze how figurations of the
'perverse homosexual' are made to function as instances of 'statecraft
as mancraft' (Ashley 1989). In these discourses, **[the 'perverse
homosexual' is figured as that threat to 'sovereign man']{.underline}**
who enables the production of (and is produced through) specific
order-versus-anarchy binaries. **[These either/or binaries participate
in the regulation of international politics because they establish
sexualized orders of international relations.]{.underline}** To be
clear, **[I am not arguing that the figure of the 'homosexual' as the
'underdeveloped', the 'undevelopable', the 'unwanted im/migrant', and
the 'terrorist' alone explains all sovereign statecraft as sovereign
mancraft. Rather, I am suggesting that if we dig down into the
evolutionary theories that produce figurations of and opposed to
'sovereign man', what we find is that these theories depend upon
understandings of civilization and its relationships to evolutionary
time and geopolitical space that are deeply racialized, (dis)ableized,
classed, sexed, gendered, and sexualized.]{.underline}** This is by no
means a new proposition, either empirically or theoretically. For
example, even a cursory reading of (neo)imperial discourses and their
supporting discourses of racialization makes it explicit that various
precursors to and variations of the 'underdeveloped' owe their temporal
and spatial figurations as perverse in part to how they are coded as
perversely sexed, gendered, and sexualized. Institutions and cultural
understandings of encumbered versus unencumbered sexuality (Mead 1928),
whiteness versus blackness (Fanon 1967), orientalism (Said 1978),
savagery and coloniality (Stoler 1995 and 2002), and postcoloniality and
imperialism (Spivak 1988) have fueled imaginaries of what came to be
known as the 'underdeveloped'. We see this in figures such as the 'noble
savage' unencumbered by sexual prohibition in modern Western anthro-
pology (Mead 1928), the 'barbaric savage' and the 'colonial' in
Victorian discourse (Stoler 1995 and 2002), the 'blackman' marked by
race in white colonialism and psychoanalysis (Fanon 1967), 'the black
female body' (hooks 1982; Hammonds 1999; Spillers 2003), 'the illiterate
peasantry, the tribals, the lowest strata of the urban sub-proletariat'
called the 'subaltern' in imperial discourse (Spivak 1988, 283), and
'the timeless oriental who does not advance with modernity' in Western
discourse (Said 1978), for example. While international relation
scholars are increasingly aware of how these figures are produced
through complex networks of racialization, (dis) ablization, gender,
class, indigeneity, and empire (beginning with Roxanne Doty's \[1996\]
seminal international relation study of 'imperial encounters'), they are
just beginning to grasp how **[these figures are also implicated in and
produced by complex networks of power/knowledge/pleasure in relation to
the figure of the 'homosexual'.]{.underline}** Yet as V. Spike Peterson
has long argued (1992, 1999, 2010, 2013, 2014a, 2014b) in her
groundbreaking international relation analyses of gender and sexuality,
figures like the **['heterosexual' and the 'homosexual' are foundational
to international relation conceptualizations of states, nations, and
international politics more widely.]{.underline}** My contention in this
set of chapters is that figurations of the 'homosexual' in Western
discourses of statecraft as mancraft and the sexualized organizations of
international relations to which they give rise are among those
modalities of power/knowledge/pleasure that are the least examined such
networks that in part underwrite international relation theories to this
day. My suggestion is that **[to ignore these moves is to not fully
understand how international relation theories and practices function,
how they can be improved, and how they can be resisted.]{.underline}**

#### heteronormative politics justifies US interventionism, war crimes, and systematic discrimination against the LGBTQIA+ community

**Emond 18** (Rachel Emond, Herbert Scoville Jr. Peace Fellow at the
Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, University of Tennessee
at Chattanooga August 2018, "American foreign policy has a masculinity
problem: a discourse analysis of the Iran deal," pg. 7)//sfs

**[Men who portray only the ideals of masculinity have historically been
rewarded with success]{.underline}** in their pursuit of power **[in
American society]{.underline}**. The fervor with which our society has
held on to this idea of what men should act like has led to what has
been coined hegemonic masculinity. **[Because the men in power portray
characteristics like strength and dominance, we associate these terms
with what "real" men should act like.]{.underline}** Over time, **[the
United States military has used this idea of hegemonic masculinity to
draw on who they most want to be the members of the armed forces. The
military has consistently portrayed its ideal candidate as an
able-bodied male who is both heterosexual and cisgender, someone they
can build into a strong, dominant, patriotic man]{.underline}** (Locke
2013). Thus military masculinity and hegemonic masculinity have become
virtually synonymous with one another, **[creating a problem when we
seek to create soft power policy solutions---characterized as
feminine---in opposition to military solutions]{.underline}**. We also
know of course that the terms listed above do not define the
characteristics of all men; or in other words, **[not all men fit into
one classification of masculinity]{.underline}** (Paechter 2006; Hoffman
2001; Lansky 2001). **[Hegemonic masculinity in practice devalues not
only women, but also men who do not fit into the idealized version of
masculinity]{.underline}**. "Masculine gender role training is probably
more rigid than its feminine equivalent...**[men are confined to a much
narrower range of acceptable gender performances]{.underline}**,"
(Lansky 2001) and we can see examples of how this plays out in our
society fairly easily. **[Conservatives heavily ridiculed President
Obama, questioned his authenticity, and called him "pathetic" and "weak"
after he shed tears when discussing the 2012 Sandy Hook School
Shooting]{.underline}** (Bobic 2016; Lussenhop 2016). **[Homosexual men
have been systematically discriminated against throughout the history of
the military]{.underline}** (Sinclair 2009). Up until President
Clinton's 1993 policy of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, **[homosexual men were
strictly banned from the United States military, a policy that presumed
that homosexuality inherently rendered someone not masculine
enough]{.underline}**---or rather, too feminine---to be capable of
serving in the military (Sinclair 2009). Even the DADT policy assumes
that homosexuality, once known of, has a negative effect on an
organization structured on idealized masculinity (Sinclair 2009).

#### Vote NEG to "Queer IR"\-\--enabling affective assemblages that deconstructs the normative conceptions of state-sanctioned militarism

**Wilcox 14** (Lauren Wilcox \| Associate Professor in Gender Studies,
Director of the University of Cambridge Centre for Gender Studies, and a
fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge. \| "Queer Theory and the "Proper
Objects" of International Relations" pg 612-615 \|
doi:10.1111/misr.12187 \| DOA: 7/21/2022 \| SAoki)

An important feature of "Queer IR," whether or not it is written in the
disciplinary spaces of IR, is that the object of study is not
necessarily the identities or individual sexual practices of particular
individuals. **[Queer IR challenges heteronormative assumptions in IR
theory by arguing that certain actors in global politics can be read as
queer]{.underline}**; **[in so doing]{.underline}**, such work
**[challenges the dichotomization of masculine and feminine, straight
and gay]{.underline}**. This reading of international politics as
"queer" is echoed in Jasbir Puar's provocative work of **["queer
assemblages"]{.underline}** which **[posits queerness in the ability of
a terrorist]{.underline}**, for example, **[to defy binary
classifications and embrace paradoxes in relation to categories of
gender and sexuality]{.underline}** (Puar and Rai 2002; Puar 2007). In
keeping with queer theory's critique of sexuality as a stable identity,
these works **[emphasize identifications rather than identities as
shifting, fluid, and sometimes contradictory]{.underline}**. Judith
Butler's theory of **[performativity conceptualizes "gender" as a
performance of imitation and parody: Gender and sexuality are
performances that do not reflect an underlying reality, but materialize
reality in ways always unstable and subject to multiple
interpretations]{.underline}** (Weber 1998a; Butler 1990; Sjoberg, this
forum). This approach is exemplified in Cynthia Weber's reading of
"post-phallic" US foreign policy in the Caribbean, in which the United
States never really held the phallus in the first place (1999). While
her first reading traces the tensions and inconsistencies in the
symbolic politics of sexuality and gender, her second reading argues
that neither "masculine" or "feminine," nor "gay" or "straight" are
subject positions that can ever be fully occupied---they are always
"troubled." Weber also argues that **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[as victim of attack and al-Qaeda as attacker
cannot be read as easily as feminized victim and racialized,
hypermasculine aggressor]{.underline}**. **[Rather, the sexual/symbolic
politics of al-Qaeda are far more complicated: al-Qaeda can be read as
feminine in terms of its representation as fluid and unlocatable, but
its gender is also changeable as in the hypermasculinity of evil in the
figures of the airline hijackers. Al-Qaeda's sexuality is also
ambiguous: while its ideology is of strict heterosexuality in pursuit of
a violent homosociality, its global presence makes it open to foreign
flows that might penetrate it as well]{.underline}**. The America that
was under attack on September 11, 2001 can be read not only as feminized
homeland, but also the masculine site of the projection of military
power (the Pentagon) and World Trade Center as site of neoliberal
globalization that is the morally neutral ground for the adjudication of
moral claims. Weber refers to this dual symbolic gender and sexuality as
"both/ and" and describes it as "queer" in contrast to the "either/or"
logic of sexual difference (Weber 2002:143, and also the introduction to
this forum). Belkin (2012) performs a similar theoretical move, arguing
that **[US hegemonic military masculinity is not premised upon exclusion
and distancing from the feminine and queer]{.underline}**, as theorists
of hegemonic masculinity have argued. **[Rather, military masculinity
often entails an embrace of these very qualities]{.underline}**. In his
study of sexuality at US military academies, Belkin argues based on the
experience of cadets that **[being sexually penetrated is not
necessarily a feminizing act, but can also be a manly act of
endurance]{.underline}**, while being forced to penetrate can also be
understood as a loss of control and masculinity Shifting Meanings of
Queer Another **[understanding of what it means to "queer"
I]{.underline}**nternational **[R]{.underline}**elations **[is found in
scholarship that stresses the shifting location of the "queer" subject,
noting that "queer" subjects often occupy ambiguous places in societies,
rather than purely excluded or stigmatized]{.underline}**. Developments
such as the US Supreme court ruling laws against "sodomy"
unconstitutional, the spread of legal same-sex marriage in many US
states, European countries, and elsewhere, and the shift of the dominant
LGBT agenda from a radical critique of norms of sexuality, family, and
kinship to the emphasis on inclusion and recognition in state
institutions of marriage and the military (which has led to the
ambivalences describes by Lind in this forum) has also given rise to a
critique of "queer liberalism" (Eng 2010). "Queer liberalism" refers to
the inclusion of queer subjects as economic subjects and subjects of
rights before the law, abetting the erasure of racial difference and as
constituting a public of individualism and meritocracy, an image of the
subject that, as feminists (and Marxists) have taught, takes for granted
the gender and sexual hierarchies of the private sphere. Queer theorists
have argued that **[the inclusion of sexuality as a "private" matter
leaves the norms and hierarchies of gender and sexuality beyond
political contestation and has played on constructions of monstrous
corporealities and sexualities in the production of racialized
others]{.underline}**. One such critique is Puar's
"**[homonationalism]{.underline}**" thesis, which crit**[iques the
"collusion of homosexuality and American nationalism that is generated
both by national rhetorics of patriotic inclusion and by gay and queer
subjects themselves"]{.underline}** (Puar 2007:39). Queer theorists have
also coined the phrase "**[pinkwashing]{.underline}**" as an
articulation of homonationalism to **[describe the co-option of white
gay people by antiimmigrant and especially anti-Muslim
forces]{.underline}** in North America, Western Europe, and Israel (Puar
2007; Schulman 2012; Lind, this forum) **[and critiqued the ways this
reproduces discourses of civilization/barbarism]{.underline}**. Noting
that the figure of "queer" is no longer, if it ever was, solely defined
by stigmatization and exclusion, queer theorists of "murderous
inclusions" that embody the "both/and" logic of queer theory, in which
**[queer figures can be both included and excluded, can be both rescued
and disposable]{.underline}** (Haritaworn, Kuntsman, and Posocco 2013a,
2014). In light of such complicated and shifting dynamics of race,
gender, sexuality, and nationality, **[the figure of "the
queer"]{.underline}** (or "the queer theorist," for that matter)
**[cannot be taken for granted as an oppositional figure in relation to
hegemonic regimes of the state, neoliberalism, or
militarism]{.underline}**. **[Theorizing "queer" as an event or a
contingent assemblage highlights the salience of the turn to affect, or
the complex emotions and attachments through which subjects and
alignments are brought into being]{.underline}**, which has
characterized much of the last decade or so in queer and critical theory
writ large. Works such as Ahmed (2004a,b) and others that grew out of
**[queer theorizing]{.underline}**14 are **[engage]{.underline}**d
**[with the ways in which emotional, affective investments are shaped
by, and inform, public policy and questions of identity, belonging in
ways that speak to the burgeoning literature in IR on
emotion]{.underline}** (Crawford 2000; Fierke 2013; Ross 2006, 2013). In
**[keeping]{.underline}** the term **["queer" open to its own
exclusions, the turn to "affect" builds upon work on the materialization
of bodies, publics, and the relations between subjects and norms that
queer theory has emphasized into a scholarly and political agenda that
challenges contemporary "affective economies"]{.underline}** (Ahmed
2004a) and the norms that bring them into being through the formation of
sexualities and racializations. The turn to **[affect is also a critique
of certain forms of queer theorizing, in which "queer" is understood as
"freedom from norms" as a kind of regulatory ideal that demarcates
"proper" queers and excludes other]{.underline}**, such as those who
assimilate to various heterosexual norms of life as a matter of survival
(Ahmed 2004b). Such a model of queer politics ultimately reproduces
liberal ideals of individual freedom and choice and reproduces the
neoliberal fetish for mobility and flexibility of subjects, excluding
certain bodies and certain forms of attachments (Puar 2007:22).
Sexuality, understood as a marker of a set of dynamics of
(de)humanization and hypervisualization of certain racialized, classed
gendered bodies (as in Amar 2013 or gestured to the ambivalences over
queer visibility theorized by Lind in this forum) draws our attention to
"sexuality" as regimes of desire, danger, and attachments that are not a
priori reducible to orientations and identity, and yet nonetheless shape
our political conditions of possibility. One such example of this method
of queering is Agathangelou et al.'s (2008) critique of violent
consequences of neoliberal privatization and the incarceration and
killing of racialized bodies, which traces the "circulation and
mobilization of feelings of desire, pleasure, fear, and repulsion
utilized to all of us into the fold of the state---the various ways in
which we become invested emotionally, libidinally, and erotically in
global capitalism's mirages of safety and inclusion" (Agathangelou et
al. 2008:122). Another example is Puar's (2007) and Butler's (2009)
respective critiques of representations of the "sexual abuse" scandal at
Abu Ghraib as a statement about Arab or Muslim sexual conservatism and
backwardness in opposition to supposedly liberated US sexuality.
**[Queer as "assemblage" calls attention both to the formation of a
"terrorist" subject as queer, as well as a method of being "attuned to
movements, intensities, emotions, energies, affectivities and textures
as they inhabit events, spatialities and corporealities"]{.underline}**
(Puar 2007:215). Puar's appropriation of the Deleuzian term "assemblage"
for her invocation of "**[queer assemblages]{.underline}**" (2007**[) is
put into productive tension with models of intersectionality which
presume that the constituent elements in identity models such as gender,
class, race, and sexuality can be disassembled]{.underline}**. Such
**[methods seek to shed light upon the "queerness" already present in
the world in terms of exclusions/inclusions, brutalities, and differing
regimes of living and dying]{.underline}** (Haritaworn, Kuntsman, and
Posocco 2014), **[while at the same time also seeking to broaden queer
analyses to include an ongoing engagement with shifting identifications,
desires, affects, and emotions that shape global politics. Queering IR
thus becomes a necessarily open-ended critique of the contingent
formations and alignments that set the terms of illegitimate or
"unlivable" lives]{.underline}** (Butler 2004), **[as well as a search
for the possibilities of life for bodies who fail to inhabit normative
conceptions of "the human."]{.underline}**

#### AI use discriminates based on gender and sexuality---its inherent and irreparable

**Segal 21** (Mark Segal is an American journalist. He is the founder
and publisher of Philadelphia Gay News and has won numerous journalism
awards for his column \"Mark My Words,\" including best column by The
National Newspaper Association, Suburban Newspaper Association and The
Society of Professional Journalists, Philadelphia Gay News 03-21-2021,

We are all now being profiled by A.I. If you're on social media, most
likely part of your profile includes your face for facial recognition.
Facial recognition is already being used by corporations, apartment
buildings and even some airports in the U.S. for security. What if this
new technology doesn't recognize you, or what if it recognizes you as
LGBT?

Joy Buolamwini, an M.I.T. student working on an A.I. facial recognition
project, created a program using A.I. that, when you looked in the
mirror in the morning, would show another face that might give you a
smile or inspiration, similar to a filter. But the mirror didn't
recognize her. She did discover, unfortunately, that the mirror worked
if she wore a white mask. Buolamwini is Black, and what she discovered
was that there was discrimination in A.I. This led her to realize that
as facial recognition becomes more widely used it would discriminate
against dark skinned people. The basic point is that **[the code for the
program can only be as good as those writing it, and sometimes those
writing the code write in their own prejudices.]{.underline}**

How serious of an issue is this? **[Amazon]{.underline}** discovered
that they were getting too many resumes to keep up with by humans, so
they **[brought in an A.I. program to]{.underline}** read them and
**[discover which applicants should receive an]{.underline}** in-person
**[interview.]{.underline}** Someone discovered along the way that
**[only a small percentage of women were being
recommended]{.underline}** by the algorithm, and **[if you attended a
women's college or played women's sports, you didn't get the interview
at all.]{.underline}** That's gender discrimination... done by a
computer program, written by a computer programmer who might not even
realize they are writing in their own biases.

So now that we know this new technology discriminates by race and
gender, **[can it not also discriminate against you as an LGBT person?
Yes, for the same reason. People writing those codes sometimes do not
know their own prejudices.]{.underline}**

We've seen A.I. discriminate against people by their race and by their
gender. How long, do you think, before A.I. discriminates based on
sexual orientation and gender identity? How long will it be before A.I.
is used to reject LGBT applicants from jobs? Or how long it will be
before A.I. is used to identify LGBT people in countries where being
LGBT is criminalized?

There may be an answer to that question. **[A Stanford University study
of artificial intelligence utilizing a facial recognition algorithm can
better choose whether an individual is LGBT than people
can.]{.underline}** The study is controversial in the tech world, mostly
due to those who suggest that facial recognition is based solely on a
face structure and don't take into account that many **[facial
recognition programs add the information about those faces that they
received from other sources]{.underline}** like social media. Looking at
your social media, buying habits and info you've given to surveys and
employers, do you believe all that material will not point to who you
are? **[Welcome to the future.]{.underline}**

FSS may ask questions about whether capitalism promotes economic
extractions as racism. Do idle people, for example, challenge the
legitimacy of corporations that presume that their only possibility is
work and extraction of value? How so? For instance, a major category
such as work is problematized by antislavery feminists as they argue
that claims to a fair and equal production do not stand. The system
depends on the co-constitution of the \"slave,\" her work and being and
extraction for its possibility. What notions of violence are imagined
and embodied in the market\'s and state\'s authority practices toward
the ordering and zoning of peoples in the private and public realms? We
might ask questions about how the colonial and racist archives\'
\"accumulated erasures, projections, fabulations and misnamings\"
(Sharpe 2016, 12) and methods force people into positions that run
against what they live everyday, what and how they know.

FGPE and FSS can grapple with the propositional assumptions they share
about subjects, species, value, security, land, violence, and freedom:
how are certain notions of the \"human\" tethered to value extraction?
And others to value theft? Or how does the agricultural industry come to
value (and simultaneously ignore those less than humans\' inhabitants
who do not possess legal rights) the indigenous populated lands as
sparse and mainly for logging and converting to farmland or for sale to
realtors worldwide? What form of violence do these enclosures and mostly
liberal moral assumptions about territory, land, work coproduce? What
form of deaths, privileges and in/security do they make possible?

**[States, militaries, and corporations depend on our feminist
disciplinary inquiry in the making of the international
order.]{.underline}** The familiar and abstract notions that the state
is responsible for its citizens\' security and that the market should
produce fair and democratic work for all become useful propositions
toward the management and governmentality of peoples. Some humans and
workers have value; their lands, institutions, and property ought to be
secured and protected. Others are selected for access or left to death
(and when they work cannot be true workers); they do not register as
humans, so violence can happen to them and their ecologies with impunity
(i.e., they are seen as empty anyway). A feminist compositional reading,
of and by FSS and FGPE, with an attention to race/colonial/neo-colonial
apparatus, interrupts normative notions about security and economy, and
allow us to consider how we go about producing dominant notions about
the zoning of ecologies and people (i.e., those who work and are
deserving citizens; those who are idle/criminals/lazy), their
management, imprisonment, and decimation. This global materiality could
be problematized from the viewpoint of those whose value is extracted
daily and whose existence and ecologies are being policed, criminalized,
and killed.

I]{.underline}**nternational **[R]{.underline}**elations---the body
brought into excruciating pain, the body as weapon, or the body as that
which is not to be targeted and hence is hit only accidentally or
collaterally. **[Such bodily focus is quite distinct from prevailing
international security practices and the disciplinary ways of addressing
those practices in IR]{.underline}**. Convention has it that states or
groups make war and, in doing so, kill and injure people that other
states are charged with protecting. **[The strategic deployment of force
in the language of rational control and risk management that dominates
security studies presents a disembodied view of subjects as reasoning
actors]{.underline}**. However, as objects of security studies, **[the
people who are protected from violence or are killed are understood as
only bodies: they are ahistorical, biopolitical aggregations whose
individual members breathe, suffer, and die]{.underline}**. In both
cases, **[the politics and sociality of bodies are
erased.]{.underline}** One of **[the]{.underline}** deep **[ironies of
security studies is that while war is actually inflicted on bodies,
bodily violence and vulnerability]{.underline}**, as **[the flip side of
security]{.underline}**, are largely **[ignored]{.underline}**. By
contrast, feminist theory is at its most powerful when it denaturalizes
accounts of individual subjectivity so as to analyze the relations of
force, violence, and language that compose our profoundly unnatural
bodies. Security studies lacks the reflexivity necessary to see its
contribution to the very context it seeks to domesticate. It has largely
ignored work in feminist theory that opens up the forces that have come
to compose and constitute the body: by and large, security studies has
an unarticulated, yet implicit, conception of bodies as individual
organisms whose protection from damage constitutes the provision of
security. **[In IR, human bodies are implicitly theorized as organisms
that are exogenously determined---they are relevant to politics only as
they live or die]{.underline}**. Such **[bodies]{.underline}** are inert
objects: they **[exist to be manipulated, possess no agency, and are
only driven by the motivations of agents]{.underline}**. Attentive to
the relations provoked by both discourse and political forces, feminist
theory redirects attention to how both of these compose and produce
bodies on terms often alien and unstable. Contemporary feminist
theorizing about embodiment provides a provocative challenge to the
stability and viability of several key concepts such as sovereignty,
security, violence, and vulnerability in IR. In this book, I draw on
recent work in **[feminist theory]{.underline}** that **[offers a
challenge to the deliberate maintenance and policing of boundaries and
the delineation of human bodies from the broader political
context.]{.underline}** Challenging this theorization of bodies as
natural organisms is a key step in not only exposing how bodies have
been implicitly theorized in IR, but in developing a reading of IR that
is attentive to the ways in which bodies are both produced and
productive. In conceptualizing the subject of IR as essentially
disembodied, IR theory impoverishes itself. An explicit focus on the
subject as embodied makes two contributions to IR. First, I address the
question vexing the humanities and social sciences of how to account for
the subject by showing that IR is wrong in its uncomplicated way of
thinking about the subject in relation to its embodiment. In its
rationalist variants, IR theory comprehends bodies only as inert objects
animated by the minds of individuals. Constructivist theory argues that
subjects are formed through social relations, but leaves the bodies of
subjects outside politics as "brute facts" (Wendt 2001, 110), while many
variants of critical theory understand the body as a medium of social
power, rather than also a force in its own right. In contrast, feminist
theory offers a challenge to the delineation of human bodies from
subjects and the broader political context. My central argument is that
the bodies that the practices of violence take as their object are
deeply political bodies, constituted in reference to historical
political conditions while at the same time acting upon our world. The
second contribution of this work is to argue that because of the way it
theorizes subjects in relation to their embodiment, IR is also lacking
in one of its primary purposes: theorizing international political
violence. This project argues that violence is more than a strategic
action of rational actors (as in rationalist theories) or a destructive
violation of community laws and norms (as in liberal and constructivist
theories). **[Because IR conventionally theorizes bodies as outside
politics and irrelevant to subjectivity, it cannot see how violence can
be understood as a creative force for shaping the limits of how we
understand ourselves as political subjects, as well as forming the
boundaries of our bodies and political communities.]{.underline}**
**[Understanding how "war is a generative force like no
other"]{.underline}** (Barkawi and Brighton 2011, 126) **[requires us to
pay attention to how bodies are killed and injured, but also formed,
re-formed, gendered, and racialized through the bodily relations of
war]{.underline}**; it also requires that we consider how bodies are
enabling and generative of war and practices of political violence more
broadly. **[Security studies]{.underline}**, the subfield of IR that
focuses on violence, **[has defined its topic of study as "the study of
the threat, use, and control of military force"]{.underline}** (Walt
1991, 212), with emphasis on the causes of war and the conditions for
peace. **[Despite the traditional focus on military force, security
studies has by and large ignored the bodies that are the intended or
inevitable targets of the use of such force]{.underline}**. One classic
work in the field, Schelling's Arms and Influence (1966), specifically
addresses coercion as the threat to cause pain and to hurt human bodies
in order to manipulate a certain outcome. Few works are so
explicit---that force involves the threat or use of military power to
hurt and kill human bodies is usually implicit in security studies.
**[Furthermore, when the violence to human bodies is made
explicit]{.underline}**, as in Schelling, **[such bodies are implicitly
theorized precisely as organisms that can be hurt or
killed]{.underline}**. **[Contributing to the neglect of theorizing
bodies has been the emphasis placed on national security.]{.underline}**
National security has long been the center of analysis in security
studies, but in recent decades, the field has broadened to consider the
referent object of security to be the individual, as "people represent,
in one sense, the irreducible basic unit to which the concept of
security can be applied" (Buzan 1991, 18). The concept of "human
security" posits the question of violence against human bodies as a
central issue in security studies, yet this theorization accepts the
individual as an exogenous unit of analysis. The relationship between
bodies, subjects, and violence still remains under-theorized, a matter
at least partly related to the ways in which the conduct of war and
political violence, as violent social practices, have been written out
of the field of IR and, in particular, out of security studies as a
subfield (Barkawi 2011). This lacuna has been noted, if rarely explored
in depth: "**[the absence of bodies in the discourses of a discipline
that was borne of a concern with war and hence violence against bodies,
itself raises curiosity as to the conditions of possibility that enabled
this absence]{.underline}**" (Jabri 2006b, 825). This work addresses
this absence and aims to show what taking bodies seriously would mean to
the study of violence in IR

### IR

#### The aff's representation of IR is inherently implicated by gender and sexuality---the 'perverse homosexual' in opposition to the 'sovereign man'

**Weber 2016** (Cynthia Weber is a Professor of International Relations
at Sussex University, "*Queer International Relations -- Sovereignty,
Sexuality, and the Will to Knowledge"*, Chapter 3, Oxford University
Press, 2016, accessed 7/17/2022)//sfs

This chapter and the next argue that four **[figures that consistently
appear in]{.underline}** the **[discourse]{.underline}** of 'Western' /
global 'Northern' 'developed' states **[as perverse---the
'underdeveloped', the 'undevelopable', the 'unwanted immigrant', and the
'terrorist']{.underline}**---**[are among]{.underline}** the specific
(if surprising) **[articulations of the 'perverse homosexual' in
international relations.]{.underline}** These particular figurations of
the 'perverse homosexual' matter for transnational/ global queer studies
and international relation because **[they make possible (by being
opposed to) specific figurations of 'sovereign man' as '(neo) imperial
man' and as '(civilizationally) developed man'.]{.underline}** All of
these figurations of or against 'sovereign man' appear to arise out of
**[and]{.underline}** in turn **[produce]{.underline}** what Berlant and
Warner call **[heteronormativity]{.underline}**, 'the institutions,
structures of understanding, and practical orientations that make
heterosexuality seem not only coherent \... but also privileged' (1998,
548 n. 2). By tracing where, when, and how these 'perverse homosexuals'
are spoken of in past and ongoing colonial, imperial, and developmental
heteronormative discourses that incite them as a concern, stabilize them
as a problem, and regulate solutions to the problems they raise through
specific policies, these chapters analyze how figurations of the
'perverse homosexual' are made to function as instances of 'statecraft
as mancraft' (Ashley 1989). In these discourses, **[the 'perverse
homosexual' is figured as that threat to 'sovereign man']{.underline}**
who enables the production of (and is produced through) specific
order-versus-anarchy binaries. **[These either/or binaries participate
in the regulation of international politics because they establish
sexualized orders of international relations.]{.underline}** To be
clear, **[I am not arguing that the figure of the 'homosexual' as the
'underdeveloped', the 'undevelopable', the 'unwanted im/migrant', and
the 'terrorist' alone explains all sovereign statecraft as sovereign
mancraft. Rather, I am suggesting that if we dig down into the
evolutionary theories that produce figurations of and opposed to
'sovereign man', what we find is that these theories depend upon
understandings of civilization and its relationships to evolutionary
time and geopolitical space that are deeply racialized, (dis)ableized,
classed, sexed, gendered, and sexualized.]{.underline}** This is by no
means a new proposition, either empirically or theoretically. For
example, even a cursory reading of (neo)imperial discourses and their
supporting discourses of racialization makes it explicit that various
precursors to and variations of the 'underdeveloped' owe their temporal
and spatial figurations as perverse in part to how they are coded as
perversely sexed, gendered, and sexualized. Institutions and cultural
understandings of encumbered versus unencumbered sexuality (Mead 1928),
whiteness versus blackness (Fanon 1967), orientalism (Said 1978),
savagery and coloniality (Stoler 1995 and 2002), and postcoloniality and
imperialism (Spivak 1988) have fueled imaginaries of what came to be
known as the 'underdeveloped'. We see this in figures such as the 'noble
savage' unencumbered by sexual prohibition in modern Western anthro-
pology (Mead 1928), the 'barbaric savage' and the 'colonial' in
Victorian discourse (Stoler 1995 and 2002), the 'blackman' marked by
race in white colonialism and psychoanalysis (Fanon 1967), 'the black
female body' (hooks 1982; Hammonds 1999; Spillers 2003), 'the illiterate
peasantry, the tribals, the lowest strata of the urban sub-proletariat'
called the 'subaltern' in imperial discourse (Spivak 1988, 283), and
'the timeless oriental who does not advance with modernity' in Western
discourse (Said 1978), for example. While international relation
scholars are increasingly aware of how these figures are produced
through complex networks of racialization, (dis) ablization, gender,
class, indigeneity, and empire (beginning with Roxanne Doty's \[1996\]
seminal international relation study of 'imperial encounters'), they are
just beginning to grasp how **[these figures are also implicated in and
produced by complex networks of power/knowledge/pleasure in relation to
the figure of the 'homosexual'.]{.underline}** Yet as V. Spike Peterson
has long argued (1992, 1999, 2010, 2013, 2014a, 2014b) in her
groundbreaking international relation analyses of gender and sexuality,
figures like the **['heterosexual' and the 'homosexual' are foundational
to international relation conceptualizations of states, nations, and
international politics more widely.]{.underline}** My contention in this
set of chapters is that figurations of the 'homosexual' in Western
discourses of statecraft as mancraft and the sexualized organizations of
international relations to which they give rise are among those
modalities of power/knowledge/pleasure that are the least examined such
networks that in part underwrite international relation theories to this
day. My suggestion is that **[to ignore these moves is to not fully
understand how international relation theories and practices function,
how they can be improved, and how they can be resisted.]{.underline}**

problem: a discourse analysis of the Iran deal," pg. 7)//sfs

**[Men who portray only the ideals of masculinity have historically been
rewarded with success]{.underline}** in their pursuit of power **[in
American society]{.underline}**. The fervor with which our society has
held on to this idea of what men should act like has led to what has
been coined hegemonic masculinity. **[Because the men in power portray
characteristics like strength and dominance, we associate these terms
with what "real" men should act like.]{.underline}** Over time, **[the
United States military has used this idea of hegemonic masculinity to
draw on who they most want to be the members of the armed forces. The
military has consistently portrayed its ideal candidate as an
able-bodied male who is both heterosexual and cisgender, someone they
can build into a strong, dominant, patriotic man]{.underline}** (Locke
2013). Thus military masculinity and hegemonic masculinity have become
virtually synonymous with one another, **[creating a problem when we
seek to create soft power policy solutions---characterized as
feminine---in opposition to military solutions]{.underline}**. We also
know of course that the terms listed above do not define the
characteristics of all men; or in other words, **[not all men fit into
one classification of masculinity]{.underline}** (Paechter 2006; Hoffman
2001; Lansky 2001). **[Hegemonic masculinity in practice devalues not
only women, but also men who do not fit into the idealized version of
masculinity]{.underline}**. "Masculine gender role training is probably
more rigid than its feminine equivalent...**[men are confined to a much
narrower range of acceptable gender performances]{.underline}**,"
(Lansky 2001) and we can see examples of how this plays out in our
society fairly easily. **[Conservatives heavily ridiculed President
Obama, questioned his authenticity, and called him "pathetic" and "weak"

that homosexuality inherently rendered someone not masculine
enough]{.underline}**---or rather, too feminine---to be capable of
serving in the military (Sinclair 2009). Even the DADT policy assumes
that homosexuality, once known of, has a negative effect on an

appropriation of ''Brandon Teena'' as ''known'' cannot lay to rest the
**[haunting]{.underline}** that **[persistently destabilizes the anchors
of identity and meaning.]{.underline}** **[As Halberstam explains, if
''haunting is an articulate discourse'' and ''a mode within which the
ghost demands something like accountability,'' then ''to tell a ghost
story means being willing to be haunted'' (73). This willingness to be

only for the past but also for the future, for those who live on in the
borderlands without a home.]{.underline}** If the queer **[appropriation

affirmingly impossible and unnecessary. Using spectrality as a
hypothesis, then, we might wonder what we would see and hear were we to
remain open to]{.underline}** ''Brandon Teena'' 's **[ghostly
returns.]{.underline}** One such moment is the point at which one
survivor, finding himself haunted, ''listens'' to the ghost and speaks
its reminder. Matthew Shepard's homophobically motivated murder occurred
in 1998, four years after ''Brandon Teena'' was killed and the year a
documentary of the events The Brandon Teena Story---was released; it
also occurred four months after the torture and murder of James Byrd in
Jasper, Texas, for being African American. In a statement bordering on
the wishes thus express themselves from beyond the grave. Tellingly, the
ghostly performative ventriloquized by Mr. Shepard, as reported in the
Washington Post, interrupts the logic of revenge and retribution
animating the force of the law: In a dramatic and surprising end to the
Matthew Shepard murder case, convicted killer Aaron J. McKinney, 22,
today was sentenced to two life sentences for beating the gay University
of Wyoming student to death last year. McKinney accepted a deal brokered
by Shepard's parents just as a jury was about to begin hearing testimony
about whether he should be put to death\.... His son, Shepard said,
believed in the death penalty for certain crimes, and had called it
justified in the racially motivated murder in Texas of James Byrd Jr.,
who was dragged to death behind a pickup truck in another hate crime
that shocked the nation's conscience. ''Little did we know that the same
response would come about involving Matt,'' Shepard said. ''I too
believe in the death penalty,'' he added. ''I would like nothing better
than to see you die, Mr. McKinney. However, this is the time to begin
the healing process. To show mercy to someone who refused to show any
mercy. ''Mr. McKinney, I'm going to grant you life, as hard as it is for
me to do so, because of Matthew . . .''18 Ghostly returns are thus a
sign of trauma and its mourning.19 This trauma, Derrida argues, is a
''politico-logic of trauma,'' that ''répond à l'injonction d'une justice
qui, au-delà du droit, surgit dans le respect même de qui n'est pas,
n'est plus ou n'est pas encore vivant, présentement vivant''
**[(''responds to the injunction of a justice which, beyond right or
law, rises up in the very respect owed to whoever is not, no longer or
not yet, living, presently living'').20 This mourning is not a form of
nostalgia, a longing for what is gone, but a kind of mourning that
is]{.underline}** ''en fait et en droit interminable, sans normalité
possible, sans limite fiable, dans la réalité ou dans le concept, entre
l'introjection et l'incorporation'' (160; ''**[in fact and by right
interminable, without possible normality, without reliable limit, in its
reality or in its concept, between introjection and
incorporation]{.underline}**,'' 97).21 **[Thinking historicity through
haunting thus combines both the seeming objectivity of events and the
subjectivity of their affective afterlife.]{.underline}** As Wendy Brown
remarks of spectrality's modality---what Derrida calls a ''being-with
specters'' that is also ''une politique de la mémoire, de l'héritage et
des générations'' (15; ''a politics of memory, of inheritance, and of
generations'' \[xviii--xix\])---''**[We inherit not 'what really
happened' to the dead but what lives on from that happening, what is
conjured from it, how past generations and events occupy the force
fields of the present, how they claim us, and how they haunt, plague,
and inspirit our imaginations and visions for the
future.]{.underline}**''22 Ghostliness and homosexuality have a long
history of association, most frequently referenced in the clichéd and
homophobic phrase ''the specter of homosexuality.'' In its most virulent
deployment, that specter is always lurking in an alley or behind a bush,
waiting to pounce upon some unsuspecting innocents. When invoked more
sympathetically, it hovers secretively around the edges of an otherwise
perfectly straight and open---albeit presumably anxious---scene. Indeed,
Derrida defines the specter in terms strikingly reminiscent of
homosexual panic, the sense of a not-quite-visible contaminating
near-presence that is also an anxious, often paranoid projection, the
material immateriality I tracked through the term queer in chapter 2: Le
spectre, comme son nom l'indique, c'est la fréquence d'une certaine
visibilité. Mais la visibilité de l'invisible. Et la visibilité, par
essence, ne se voit pas, c'est pourquoi elle reste . . . au-delà du
phénomène ou de l'étant. Le spectre, c'est aussi, entre autres choses,
ce qu'on imagine, ce qu'on croit voir et qu'on projette: sur un écran
imaginaire, là où il n'y a rien à voir. Pas même l'écran, parfois, et un
écran a toujours, au fond, au fond qu'il est, une structure, une
structure d'apparition disparaissante. Mais voilà qu'on ne peut plus
fermer l'oeil à guetter le retour. (Spectres de Marx, 165) The specter,
as its name indicates, is the frequency of a certain visibility. But the
visibility of the invisible. And visibility, by its essence, is not
seen, which is why it remains . . . beyond the phenomenon, or beyond
being. The specter is also, among other things, what one thinks one
sees, and which one projects---on an imaginary screen where there is
nothing to see. Not even the screen sometimes, and a screen always has,
at bottom, in the bottom or background that is, a structure of
disappearing apparition. But now one can no longer get any shut-eye,
being so intent to watch out for the return. (Specters of Marx, 101)
**[Like the closet, whose very existence suggests the opening onto what
is concealed, Derrida likens the specter to the screen whose structure
is always already that of a disappearing appearance. The ghost is thus
also structural.]{.underline}** Terry Castle observes this phenomenon in
relation to the ''apparitional'' history of the lesbian: ''When it comes
to lesbians . . . many people have trouble seeing what's in front of
them. The lesbian remains a kind of 'ghost effect' in the cinema world
of modern life: elusive, vaporous, difficult to spot---even when she is
there, in plain view, mortal and magnificent, at the center of the
screen. Some may even deny that she exists at all.''23 For those who
live ''on the other side'' of the expression, ''the specter of
homosexuality,'' those who might be said to be named, ''ghosted'' by
that phrase, ghosts are neither scary nor menacing, however terrifying
the prospect of being turned into one might be. For one may also reverse
the perspective and understand the specter as that which sees without
being seen, as what produces the sense of being seen, observed,
surveilled.24 Hélène Cixous declared, concerning one famous gynephobic
patriarchal figure of woman, ''You only have to look at the Medusa
straight on to see her. And she's not deadly. She's beautiful and she's
laughing.''25 To be a ghost among ghosts is to ''see'' the ghost not as
a feared and fearful projection---the way Medusa cannot be directly seen
by men---but perhaps as beautiful, though rarely laughing, for the
specter is the form a certain unfinished mourning takes. Thus **[part of
what it might mean to live with ghosts would be to understand oneself as
''ghosted,'' and to understand ''learning to live'' as something that
takes place ''between life and death'' as the ''non contemporaneity with
itself of the living present.''26 This would then be an approach to
history---and to justice---that would neither ''forget the dead'' nor
''successfully'' mourn them.]{.underline}**27 Exploring further the
notion of haunting as the way history registers as affect in the social
and psychic lives of beings, and the reciprocity of haunting and being
haunted, Avery Gordon follows the figure of the ghost and the poetics of
haunting in other contexts to understand the specificity of this way of
coming to terms with historical trauma.28 Ghostly Matters looks to Toni
Morrison's Beloved to see how haunting conveys the traumatic effect and
affect of the historical event on the subject and the social
responsibility that is thereby entailed.29 Thus what Derrida analyzes in
the work of Marx and philosophy, Gordon studies in a kind of embodied
poetics, tracking how the ghost's figurative ''materialization''
elicits, even as it emblematizes, traumatic repetition and working
through.30 In that process of materialization, or poetic embodiment,
Hamlet's father undergoes a morphological transformation, from Danish
king to African slave and from father to daughter; the ghostly exchange
takes place not between a father and his son but between a daughter and
her mother; and the ''allegory'' of haunting moves from Europe to
America.31 Like Gordon, in what follows I track a transatlantic passage
from an earlier moment and an earlier historical trauma as they haunt
both within and outside of their own time. In Premodern Sexualities,
Louise Fradenburg and I raised questions concerning the fantasmatic
relationship that we, as scholars of the past and scholars working
''queerly'' in the history of sexuality, might affirm in relation to the
past, ''ours'' or that of others, in the name of pleasure.32 It was an
effort, in part, to honor the complex pleasure positivity of queer
theory in its resistance to the heteronormatively disciplining
discourses that came self-righteously to the fore when aids in the
United States became associated with ''homosexuals'' and
''promiscuity.'' It was also a way of examining how desires and
identifications---queer theory's psychoanalytically inflected
terminological legacies---are at work in historical scholars'
investments in the differences and similarities between the past and the
present. Finally, it was a way of noting historiography's own
(self-)disciplining force, its ''repudiations of pleasure and fantasy''
in spite---or because---of its queer wishes (xvii); thus we argued for a
queer historiography that would devote itself to a critical
revalorization of the places and possibilities of pleasure within the
serious and ''ascetic'' work of history. **[Insofar as queer historicism
registers the affective investments of the present in the past, however,
it harbors within itself not only pleasure, but also pain, a traumatic
pain whose ethical insistence is to ''live to tell'' through complex and
circuitous processes of working through.]{.underline}** Thus we
concluded the introduction with an ethically impelled wish: **[The past
may not be the present, but it is sometimes in the present, haunting,
even if only through our uncertain knowledges of it, our hopes of
surviving and living well. The questions we are raising about the
practice of history may help us understand better the living and dying
of twentieth-century bodies and pleasures. And we hope that
consideration of the ways in which historicisms are currently
questioning sexuality, and sex studies questioning historicism, will
work to affirm the pleasures of mortal creatures.]{.underline}** (xxi)
**[The past is in the present in the form of a haunting. This is what,
among other things, doing a queer kind of history means, since it
involves an openness to the possibility of being haunted, even
inhabited, by ghosts. What is transmitted in the cohabitation of ghostly
past and present is related to survival, to ''living well,'' and to the
''pleasures of mortal creatures,'' survivals and pleasures that have
little to do with normative understandings of biological
reproduction.]{.underline}**

conceptions of international governance. In doing so, **[queer theorists
use existing literature or audio-visual material such as movies or even
performances to go beyond the apparently obvious to deconstruct and then
reconstruct IR events and processes.]{.underline}** They often exhibit a
critical perspective towards naturally assumed conditions of space and
time that tend to conceal and flatten differences among actors and
interpretations of international events. For example, Cynthia
**[Weber]{.underline}** (2016) **[uses Hillary Clinton's sexual rights

statecraft' that contests traditional, gendered and binary approaches to
governance. Weber highlights how despite transforming the notion of the
homosexual from deviant into normal rights-holder in her speech, Clinton
still produced an international binary of progressive versus intolerant
states. On the other hand, Conchita Wurst -- a character created by
Thomas Neuwirth -- challenged accepted notions of what is considered
normal or perverse by performing in drag with a beard.]{.underline}** In
the course of this, Wurst destabilised racial, sexual, gendered and geo-
political notions of what it means to be a European. Taken together,

An important feature of "Queer IR," whether or not it is written in the
disciplinary spaces of IR, is that the object of study is not
necessarily the identities or individual sexual practices of particular
individuals. **[Queer IR challenges heteronormative assumptions in IR
theory by arguing that certain actors in global politics can be read as
queer]{.underline}**; **[in so doing]{.underline}**, such work
**[challenges the dichotomization of masculine and feminine, straight
and gay]{.underline}**. This reading of international politics as
"queer" is echoed in Jasbir Puar's provocative work of **["queer
assemblages"]{.underline}** which **[posits queerness in the ability of
a terrorist]{.underline}**, for example, **[to defy binary
classifications and embrace paradoxes in relation to categories of
gender and sexuality]{.underline}** (Puar and Rai 2002; Puar 2007). In
keeping with queer theory's critique of sexuality as a stable identity,
these works **[emphasize identifications rather than identities as
shifting, fluid, and sometimes contradictory]{.underline}**. Judith
Butler's theory of **[performativity conceptualizes "gender" as a
performance of imitation and parody: Gender and sexuality are
performances that do not reflect an underlying reality, but materialize
reality in ways always unstable and subject to multiple
interpretations]{.underline}** (Weber 1998a; Butler 1990; Sjoberg, this
forum). This approach is exemplified in Cynthia Weber's reading of
"post-phallic" US foreign policy in the Caribbean, in which the United
States never really held the phallus in the first place (1999). While
her first reading traces the tensions and inconsistencies in the
symbolic politics of sexuality and gender, her second reading argues
that neither "masculine" or "feminine," nor "gay" or "straight" are
subject positions that can ever be fully occupied---they are always
"troubled." Weber also argues that **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[as victim of attack and al-Qaeda as attacker
cannot be read as easily as feminized victim and racialized,
hypermasculine aggressor]{.underline}**. **[Rather, the sexual/symbolic
politics of al-Qaeda are far more complicated: al-Qaeda can be read as
feminine in terms of its representation as fluid and unlocatable, but
its gender is also changeable as in the hypermasculinity of evil in the
figures of the airline hijackers. Al-Qaeda's sexuality is also
ambiguous: while its ideology is of strict heterosexuality in pursuit of
a violent homosociality, its global presence makes it open to foreign
flows that might penetrate it as well]{.underline}**. The America that
was under attack on September 11, 2001 can be read not only as feminized
homeland, but also the masculine site of the projection of military
power (the Pentagon) and World Trade Center as site of neoliberal
globalization that is the morally neutral ground for the adjudication of
moral claims. Weber refers to this dual symbolic gender and sexuality as
"both/ and" and describes it as "queer" in contrast to the "either/or"
logic of sexual difference (Weber 2002:143, and also the introduction to
this forum). Belkin (2012) performs a similar theoretical move, arguing
that **[US hegemonic military masculinity is not premised upon exclusion
and distancing from the feminine and queer]{.underline}**, as theorists
of hegemonic masculinity have argued. **[Rather, military masculinity
often entails an embrace of these very qualities]{.underline}**. In his
study of sexuality at US military academies, Belkin argues based on the
experience of cadets that **[being sexually penetrated is not
necessarily a feminizing act, but can also be a manly act of
endurance]{.underline}**, while being forced to penetrate can also be
understood as a loss of control and masculinity Shifting Meanings of
Queer Another **[understanding of what it means to "queer"
I]{.underline}**nternational **[R]{.underline}**elations **[is found in
scholarship that stresses the shifting location of the "queer" subject,
noting that "queer" subjects often occupy ambiguous places in societies,
rather than purely excluded or stigmatized]{.underline}**. Developments
such as the US Supreme court ruling laws against "sodomy"
unconstitutional, the spread of legal same-sex marriage in many US
states, European countries, and elsewhere, and the shift of the dominant
LGBT agenda from a radical critique of norms of sexuality, family, and
kinship to the emphasis on inclusion and recognition in state
institutions of marriage and the military (which has led to the
ambivalences describes by Lind in this forum) has also given rise to a
critique of "queer liberalism" (Eng 2010). "Queer liberalism" refers to
the inclusion of queer subjects as economic subjects and subjects of
rights before the law, abetting the erasure of racial difference and as
constituting a public of individualism and meritocracy, an image of the
subject that, as feminists (and Marxists) have taught, takes for granted
the gender and sexual hierarchies of the private sphere. Queer theorists
have argued that **[the inclusion of sexuality as a "private" matter
leaves the norms and hierarchies of gender and sexuality beyond
political contestation and has played on constructions of monstrous
corporealities and sexualities in the production of racialized
others]{.underline}**. One such critique is Puar's
"**[homonationalism]{.underline}**" thesis, which crit**[iques the
"collusion of homosexuality and American nationalism that is generated
both by national rhetorics of patriotic inclusion and by gay and queer
subjects themselves"]{.underline}** (Puar 2007:39). Queer theorists have
also coined the phrase "**[pinkwashing]{.underline}**" as an
articulation of homonationalism to **[describe the co-option of white
gay people by antiimmigrant and especially anti-Muslim
forces]{.underline}** in North America, Western Europe, and Israel (Puar
2007; Schulman 2012; Lind, this forum) **[and critiqued the ways this
reproduces discourses of civilization/barbarism]{.underline}**. Noting
that the figure of "queer" is no longer, if it ever was, solely defined
by stigmatization and exclusion, queer theorists of "murderous
inclusions" that embody the "both/and" logic of queer theory, in which
**[queer figures can be both included and excluded, can be both rescued
and disposable]{.underline}** (Haritaworn, Kuntsman, and Posocco 2013a,
2014). In light of such complicated and shifting dynamics of race,
gender, sexuality, and nationality, **[the figure of "the
queer"]{.underline}** (or "the queer theorist," for that matter)
**[cannot be taken for granted as an oppositional figure in relation to
hegemonic regimes of the state, neoliberalism, or
militarism]{.underline}**. **[Theorizing "queer" as an event or a
contingent assemblage highlights the salience of the turn to affect, or
the complex emotions and attachments through which subjects and
alignments are brought into being]{.underline}**, which has
characterized much of the last decade or so in queer and critical theory
writ large. Works such as Ahmed (2004a,b) and others that grew out of
**[queer theorizing]{.underline}**14 are **[engage]{.underline}**d
**[with the ways in which emotional, affective investments are shaped
by, and inform, public policy and questions of identity, belonging in
ways that speak to the burgeoning literature in IR on
emotion]{.underline}** (Crawford 2000; Fierke 2013; Ross 2006, 2013). In
**[keeping]{.underline}** the term **["queer" open to its own
exclusions, the turn to "affect" builds upon work on the materialization
of bodies, publics, and the relations between subjects and norms that
queer theory has emphasized into a scholarly and political agenda that
challenges contemporary "affective economies"]{.underline}** (Ahmed
2004a) and the norms that bring them into being through the formation of
sexualities and racializations. The turn to **[affect is also a critique
of certain forms of queer theorizing, in which "queer" is understood as
"freedom from norms" as a kind of regulatory ideal that demarcates
"proper" queers and excludes other]{.underline}**, such as those who
assimilate to various heterosexual norms of life as a matter of survival
(Ahmed 2004b). Such a model of queer politics ultimately reproduces
liberal ideals of individual freedom and choice and reproduces the
neoliberal fetish for mobility and flexibility of subjects, excluding
certain bodies and certain forms of attachments (Puar 2007:22).
Sexuality, understood as a marker of a set of dynamics of
(de)humanization and hypervisualization of certain racialized, classed
gendered bodies (as in Amar 2013 or gestured to the ambivalences over
queer visibility theorized by Lind in this forum) draws our attention to
"sexuality" as regimes of desire, danger, and attachments that are not a
priori reducible to orientations and identity, and yet nonetheless shape
our political conditions of possibility. One such example of this method
of queering is Agathangelou et al.'s (2008) critique of violent
consequences of neoliberal privatization and the incarceration and
killing of racialized bodies, which traces the "circulation and
mobilization of feelings of desire, pleasure, fear, and repulsion
utilized to all of us into the fold of the state---the various ways in
which we become invested emotionally, libidinally, and erotically in
global capitalism's mirages of safety and inclusion" (Agathangelou et
al. 2008:122). Another example is Puar's (2007) and Butler's (2009)
respective critiques of representations of the "sexual abuse" scandal at
Abu Ghraib as a statement about Arab or Muslim sexual conservatism and
backwardness in opposition to supposedly liberated US sexuality.
**[Queer as "assemblage" calls attention both to the formation of a
"terrorist" subject as queer, as well as a method of being "attuned to
movements, intensities, emotions, energies, affectivities and textures
as they inhabit events, spatialities and corporealities"]{.underline}**
(Puar 2007:215). Puar's appropriation of the Deleuzian term "assemblage"
for her invocation of "**[queer assemblages]{.underline}**" (2007**[) is
put into productive tension with models of intersectionality which
presume that the constituent elements in identity models such as gender,
class, race, and sexuality can be disassembled]{.underline}**. Such
**[methods seek to shed light upon the "queerness" already present in
the world in terms of exclusions/inclusions, brutalities, and differing
regimes of living and dying]{.underline}** (Haritaworn, Kuntsman, and
Posocco 2014), **[while at the same time also seeking to broaden queer
analyses to include an ongoing engagement with shifting identifications,
desires, affects, and emotions that shape global politics. Queering IR
thus becomes a necessarily open-ended critique of the contingent
formations and alignments that set the terms of illegitimate or
"unlivable" lives]{.underline}** (Butler 2004), **[as well as a search
for the possibilities of life for bodies who fail to inhabit normative
conceptions of "the human."]{.underline}**

#### "queering IR" creates cracks in the boundaries that allows us to imagine the world in terms other than nationalism 

**Kangas et al 18** (Anni Kangas, Tampere University, Tampere University

international through collaging," accessed 07-21-2022)//sfs

The term [queer]{.underline} [lacks a straightforward
definition]{.underline}. While there are multiple queer traditions, it
is possible to argue that three key components underpin most queer
perspectives: queer theory, radical activism and gender or gay/lesbian
studies (Wickman 2016). However[, the term queer is **not just another
signifier** of sexual difference]{.underline}; as a social science
notion, it is a broader notion than a synonym for non-heterosexuals.
Halberstam argues that [queer should be used to mark radical models of
sexual politics]{.underline}, "it is important to resist using \[it\] as
an umbrella term for sexual minorities" (Halberstam 2000, 632) or as "an
object to be studied" as Richter-Montpetit emphasizes. [The radical
contingency of queer perspectives distinguishes them from those LGBT
perspectives that assume that a (liberal) rights-seeking subject is
pre-formed before entering the political field.]{.underline} [Refusing
to assume such a stable subject, queer perspectives are able to inquire
into **subject-making as a political process**.]{.underline} While
sexuality, gender and desire are seen to play a normalizing role in this
process, they are examined as a part of wider power relations. [This
extends IR queer inquiries to also address questions related to racism,
imperialism, transphobia, and so on (Richter-Montpetit 2018). The fact
that queering is not limited to theorizing sexual identifications is
crucial for the attempt to smash containers]{.underline} (Wilcox 2014).
We understand [queering as a way of thinking and doing -- or an
analytical category -- that resists "proper objects" and **avoids
exclusionary moves** that could be made to signify
monolithically]{.underline} (Richter-Montpetit and Weber 2017). Sjoberg
characterizes queer as [something that is unsettleable, uncaging and
engaged in projects of destruction]{.underline} (Sjoberg 2014, 608). The
theme of smashing is also present in Richter-Montpetit's (2018, 3)
argument that [queer analytics **"crack open for investigation" such
dimensions of social life and international politics** that have been
overlooked or misunderstood by mainstream approaches: "Queer analytics
have produced insights not only on the political character of sexual
norms and logics, but also offer a more expansive notion of the
political in IR"]{.underline} (Richter-Montpetit 2018, 3; see also
Wilcox 2016). We argue in this article that collaging provides one
possibility to acknowledge and visualize such a more expansive notion of
the political. Collaging is a form of inquiry that can make visible
alternative spaces of justice across various power political dividing
lines, spaces that are relational, multiscalar and non-fixed.
Arguably, [this enables **moving beyond forms of methodological
nationalism that take nation-states as containers for
analysis**]{.underline} (see also Wimmer and Schiller 2002). National
imaginaries can dominate analyses of sexuality and gender, for example,
by creating binary oppositions between "gender equal" vs. "traditional"
national societies. At classes where collages were made, we also
discussed the ways in which methodologically [nationalist thinking
easily forms part of debates]{.underline} on the politics of sexuality
and how such debates often assume certain binaries. However, the
politics of gender and sexuality are frequently analyzed through, within
or across national framings. Despite Lauren Berlant and Elizabeth
Freeman's suggestion that queer theorizing's consent to national
normativity must be made provisional (Berlant and Freeman 1993), this
may also be the case in queer studies (e.g., Essig 1999). In these
discussions, [similarities within nationally defined groups are
emphasized and differences are identified across state borders. Space is
thought about in absolute terms, as a container]{.underline}: it is seen
to contain things in the same way as any container contains things. As
Berlant and Warner emphasize, [queer theorizing challenges us here: It
prompts imagining the "world" in terms other than containers, such as
established communities or groups:]{.underline} "[The queer world is a
space of entrances, exits, unsystematized lines of acquaintance,
projected horizons, typifying examples, alternate routes, blockages,
incommensurate geographie]{.underline}s" (Berlant and Warner 1998, 558).
Collaging, as we argue in this article, enables crafting such a world
into being. The point of the collaging exercise is not to deny the power
and influence of states and nation-states in the politics of gender and
sexuality but rather to see and imagine other spaces of justice across
and beyond national borders. Despite this, some of the collages
reproduce the idea of a nation-state as the framework within which
politics of gender and sexuality are examined. As one of the
participants of the workshop (to be discussed later on) wrote, in my
collage, I critiqued the narrow role reserved for Finnish women and the
heteronormative assumptions -- as well as the assumption of whiteness.
But I did not for a minute problematize the fact that by doing that I
actually took an imaginary "nation" as the subject of my collage. In the
next section we discuss the epistemological potential of collages to
trouble container images.

#### Exclusion DA\--Disciplinary International Relations excludes queer perspectives

**Weber 14** (Cynthia Weber, Professor of International Relations at
Sussex University, European Journal of International Relations
04-03-2014, "Why is there no Queer International Theory?,"
http://ejt.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/04/02/1354066114524236)//sfs

My claim is that the presumed non-existence of Queer International
Theory cannot be explained merely by its absence from prestigious IR
journals and book series because this absence is the (un)conscious
effect of how so-called **[Disciplinary IR codes various types of theory
as failures.]{.underline}** '**[Disciplinary IR]{.underline}**' ---
which aspires to be but is not equivalent to the discipline of IR as a
whole --- **[is]{.underline}**, of course, as **[imagined as it is
enacted, and it changes as social, cultural, economic, and political
forces change.]{.underline}** Yet, at any particular historical moment,
IR scholars have a working knowledge of Disciplinary IR because **[it
embodies the general commitments and standards that regulate, manage,
and normalize 'the conduct of conduct']{.underline}** (Foucault, 1994:
237) regarding IR publishing, funding, hiring, promotion, and tenure
decisions. While there are certainly institutional and national
variations in how these standards are enacted (Hoffmann, 1977; Waever,
1998), most IR academics are required to justify their work with regard
to these standards at some point in their careers.

Disciplinary IR's commitments and standards are as much the performative
result of so-called 'mainstream' agendas of learned societies,
universities, independent funding agencies, and governments that support
socially, culturally, economically, or politically 'policy-relevant,'
'useful,' or 'impactful' research as they are the performative outcome
of so-called 'dissident' practices (Ashley and Walker, 1990; also see
Soreanu, 2010) that seek to rewrite, resist, or rebel against so-called
mainstream agendas, be they 'scientific,' 'positivist,' or 'neoliberal,'
for example. Together, these intricately **[intertwined positions
produce a Disciplinary IR that claims to speak for the whole of the
discipline of IR because it wields sufficient power to (de)legitimate IR
scholars and their work for many user communities. Because of its power,
Disciplinary IR is as often contested as it is assimilated to by IR
scholars of virtually all intellectual dispositions.]{.underline}**4

A central tenet of what I am calling Disciplinary IR is embedded in the
work of Martin Wight. Wight claimed that for international theorizing to
succeed, it must accumulate knowledge about interstate relations (Smith,
2000; Wight, 1966). My claim is that from a Disciplinary IR perspective,
**[theories --- including queer international theories --- fail because
they are judged not to be making progress toward this goal. This is what
explains the subsequent absence of queer international theories from
prestigious IR journals and book series and the presumed non-existence
of Queer International Theory.]{.underline}**

To substantiate this claim, I investigate how Disciplinary IR employs
three strategies **[--- homologization, figuration, and
gentrification]{.underline}** --- to **[make it appear as if there is no
Queer International Theory.]{.underline}** **[Homologization describes
the act of]{.underline}** **[using a homology to describe relationships,
relative positions, and structures in a set of elements in order to
prescribe how relationships ought to be ordered and how elements and
their aims ought to be valued]{.underline}** (e.g. Wight, 1966).5
**[Figuration describes the act of employing semiotic tropes that
combine knowledges, practices, and power to shape how we map our worlds
and understand actual things in those worlds]{.underline}** (Haraway,
1997). **[Gentrification describes the replacement of mix with
homogeneity while pretending difference and privilege do not
exist]{.underline}** (Schulman, 2012b).

My analysis is grounded in Martin Wight's famous homology: 'Politics is
to International Politics as Political Theory is to Historical
Interpretation' (Wight, 1966).This is not only because Wight's homology
illustrates and/or authorizes homologization, figuration, and
gentrification. It is also because Wight's **[homology elegantly
encapsulates how Disciplinary IR has traditionally thought of itself
since its formation in the wake of the First World War --- as separate
but parallel to the discipline of politics and as capable of achieving
its aim to produce unique cumulative knowledge]{.underline}** about
international politics only if it models itself on how political theory
is practiced. In the 1960s, Wight mobilized this generalized view to
make his case for a historical approach to the study of IR --- both as a
participant in the first 'great debate' over method and methodology
between traditionalists and behavioralists and as a historian who
founded an International Relations department. This in part accounts for
Wight's contentious claim that international theory can only succeed if
it transforms itself into historical interpretation and his contentious
placement of the term 'Historical Interpretation' in the place one would
expect to find the term 'International Theory' in his homology. IR
debates about methodology and history have certainly moved on since
Wight's time (e.g. Lapid, 1989; Rosenberg, 2006). Even so, the values
and relationships expressed in Wight's homology are still widely
accepted in Disciplinary IR, to the point that Wight's **[homology
remains a generalizable guide to regulating how international theorizing
ought to be conducted.]{.underline}**

Beginning with Martin Wight's homology, I trace how Wight's strategy of
homologization equates international theory and the discipline of
International Relations with failure, authorizes the figuration of
specific types of international theory and specific ways of producing
international theory as failures, and embraces a gentrified strategy of
substitution as a legitimate response to these failures. Applying these
logics to queer international theories, I suggest that homologization,
figuration, and gentrification combine to make it appear as if there is
no Queer International Theory. In so doing, they authorize the
discipline of IR (on Disciplinary IR's behalf) to dismiss queer
international theories as International Theory, resulting in negative
consequences not only for the scholars who produce this type of work,
but for the discipline of IR as a whole.

I conclude by reflecting on the costs of using Wight's homology to
regulate, manage, and normalize the scholarly conduct of international
theorizing --- for queer international theories and for the discipline
of IR as a whole. I argue that while most scholars in the discipline
(un)consciously embrace Wight's homology as their guide to disciplinary
success, my analysis of Queer International Theory reveals that Wight's
**[homology has three detrimental effects on the discipline: it limits
how international politics is enriched by critical inquiry, it cedes
consideration of key international phenomena to other disciplines, and
it paradoxically leads to disciplinary failure on the discipline's own
terms.]{.underline}**

Because the case of Queer International Theory illustrates how
Disciplinary IR manages not just queer international theories, but all
theories that profess to be International Theory, generalizable lessons
can be drawn from this case for the discipline as a whole. Primary among
these is that IR's disciplinary attachment to Wight's homology
compromises possibilities for doing international theorizing and
thinking international politics not only on terms the discipline
rejects, but on terms the discipline embraces.

[What does it mean to be an ally to not only communities mobilizing for
justice but also to a ﬁeld of study/scholars?]{.underline} I contend
that this question is vital and pivotal as we try to grapple with Queer
International Relations (IR)/Global Queer Studies' relationship with the
IR discipline. In the context of academic institutions and practices, [I
see "allies" as those who may not regularly cite, rely upon, study,
teach, or participate in a particular ﬁeld of studies but are interested
and invested in the development and endurance of that scholarship. But
what is done to and with Queer IR by allies? Are ally politics aiming to
deconstruct, dismantle, and radically transform the very systems of
which they are beneﬁciaries? Or **are allies leaving power relationships
intact because they are actually uneasy with, dismissive of, or unclear
about Queer IR theorizing?**]{.underline} Scholars working in queer

2009; Ahmed 2012; Gutierrez y Muhs, Niemann, Gonzalez, and Harris 2012).
Perhaps, for some, being an ally means establishing queer-friendly
credentials, so they might support the work of a scholar who does Queer
IR or devote a week of attention in their IR class to Global Queer
Studies to illustrate the "diversity" of IR theories. Or, they might
enfold Queer IR insights within slightly "safer" research agendas, such
as "human rights." [But **how far are they willing to go in creating
space for Queer IR to challenge how IR is performed, or how marginalized
scholars are treated as different, anomalies, and
incompetent? **]{.underline}Anecdotal evidence reveals that scholars
doing Queer IR, like other marginalized academics, face troubling
encounters on blogs and Facebook pages, in conferences, job search
committees, tenure and promotion committees, and reviews of journal
articles and manuscripts. [These interactions **include thinly veiled
homophobia or transphobia, scornful dismissal of queer studies as "not
rigorous enough" or "not legitimate," and attempts to make deviant and
intolerable those doing Queer IR **]{.underline}(Weber 2014b).
But ["well meaning" self-proclaimed allies]{.underline} in ﬁelds such as
Feminist IR, Global Politics, or Postcolonial IR [may also participate
in acts of exclusion and dismissal, even as these very scholars may ﬁnd
their allies, including in queer studies, "don't get
it."]{.underline} In interrogating resistance by not only those
adamantly opposed to but also alleged/potential allies of Queer IR, [I
have been contemplating Queer IR's promise (and threat) of revealing the
instability of IR as a discipline.]{.underline} I contend that [it is
not just in the mainstream-alternative approaches debate but also in the
acts of alleged solidarity and support that we see how tenuously IR
operates.]{.underline} My hope is that we do a better job in
interrogating ally politics among and between various communities of
scholars. In my classes, I have unsurprisingly discovered that many of
my [students hold a perception that]{.underline} there is a difference
between international LGBTQ activism and [Queer IR
theory.]{.underline} The latter, they claim, [is "elitist" and
inaccessible.]{.underline} Many queer or allied students see themselves
and their struggles as intimately connected with queerness,
circumscribed as identity politics or the implementation of rights for
"sexual minorities." [When we discuss]{.underline} examples of gay
rights movements or trans-rights movements around the world, they
respond favorably, understanding such attempts for social justice within
a human-rights framework of perpetrator/victim. But when I assign
readings that I think of as Queer IR/ Global Studies,
regarding **[homonationalism]{.underline}** (Puar 2005,
2007), [postcolonial and global antiracist engagement with
queerness]{.underline} (Hawley 2001), [and heteronormative and
cis-normative ontologies underlying global politics and
statecraft]{.underline} (Cohn 1987; Weber 1994a,b, 1998a,b, 1999, 2002,
2014a; Richter-Montpetit 2007; Agathangelou et al. 2008; Canaday 2011;
Rao 2012; Sjoberg, this forum), [many]{.underline} (not all)
students [see the work, or at least parts of it, as divisive,
inaccessible, and even "dangerous" for the "real struggles" of queer
communities.]{.underline} It is not uncommon that [students may cling to
a perceived praxis/theory divide.]{.underline} I see it when I teach
feminist theory and try to push past discussions on sexual violence
prevention or reproductive rights to also include postcolonial or black
feminist theory. I see it when I teach human rights and try to move the
conversation beyond successful international criminal legal cases to
questioning the very premises of human rights discourses. A signiﬁcant
number of students are indeed willing to sit with the discomfort of
acting toward justice while simultaneously questioning and challenging
what motivates and counts as "action" and "justice."
However, [the **students who show resistance** want to see IR as a ﬁeld
with terminology, jargon, and "skills" to master so that they can "do
something" in the real world to protect people from persecution and
harm. **Anything else seems too negative, too threatening to their
relationship to the IR discipline**, which to them holds the promise of
allowing them to "understand" global politics and to become career
professionals in changing the world.]{.underline} The same students who
might excitedly read Feminist IR scholarship or human rights work on
sexual minorities, balk or seem taken aback when I mention Queer IR or
Queer Global Studies, thinking that this scholarship belongs in some
strange, otherworldly "theory" universe. Yet, they would call themselves
allies, or part of the "movement" for LGBTQ rights.Optional card---can

[National recognition and inclusion]{.underline}, here signaled as the
annexation of homosexual jargon, [is contingent upon the **segregation**
and **disqualification** of **racial and sexual others** from the
national imaginary.]{.underline} At work in this dynamic is [a form of
sexual exceptionalism---the emergence of]{.underline} national
homosexuality, what I term ''[homonationalism''---that corresponds
with]{.underline} the coming out of the exceptionalism of **[American
empire.]{.underline}** Further, [this brand of homosexuality operates as
a **regulatory script** not only of normative]{.underline} gayness,
[queerness]{.underline}, or homosexuality, [but also of the racial and
national norms that reinforce these sexual subjects. There is a
commitment to the global dominant **ascendancy of
whiteness**]{.underline} that is implicated in the propagation of the
United States as empire as well as the alliance between this propagation
and this brand of homosexuality. The fleeting sanctioning of a national
homosexual subject is possible, not only through the proliferation of
sexual-racial subjects who invariably fall out of its narrow terms of
acceptability, as others have argued, but more significantly, [through
the simultaneous engendering and disavowal of populations of
sexual-racial others]{.underline} who need not apply. In what follows I
explore these three imbricated manifestations---sexual exceptionalism,
queer as regulatory, and the ascendancy of whiteness---and their
relations to the production of terrorist and citizen bodies. My goal is
to present a dexterous portrait, signaling attentiveness to how, why,
and where these threads bump into each other and where they weave
together, resisting a mechanistic explanatory device that may cover all
the bases. In the case of what I term ''U.S. sexual exceptionalism,'' a
narrative claiming the successful management of life in regard to a
people, what is noteworthy is that [an exceptional form of national
heteronormativity is now joined by an exceptional form of national
homonormativity]{.underline}, in other words,
[homonationalism]{.underline}. Collectively, [they continue or extend
the project of U.S. nationalism and imperial expansion endemic to the
**war on terror**]{.underline}. The terms of degeneracy have shifted
such that homosexuality is no longer a priori excluded from nationalist
formations. I unearth the forms of regulation im- homonationalism and
biopolitics 3 plicit in notions of queer subjects that are transcendent,
secular, or otherwise exemplary as resistant, and open up the question
of queer re/production and regeneration and its contribution to the
project of the optimization of life. The [ascendancy of
whiteness]{.underline} is a description of biopolitics pro√ered by Rey
Chow, who [links the violence of liberal deployments of diversity and
multiculturalism to the ''**valorization of life**'' alibi that then
allows for rampant exploitation of the very subjects included in
discourses of diversity in the first instance]{.underline}. I elucidate
how these three approaches to the study of sexuality, taken together,
suggest a trenchant rereading of biopolitics with regard to queerness as
well as [the intractability of queerness from biopolitical arrangements
of life and death.]{.underline}

Science at the University of Florida, in "The Routledge Handbook to
Rethinking Ethics in International Relations" 06-09-2020, "Trans\*
theorizing for ethics in International Relations" doi:
https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315613529)//sfs

Judith Butler, in Precarious Life, made the argument that,
in **[neoliberal capitalist imperium]{.underline}**,1 '**[dissent is
quelled]{.underline}**, in part, **[through threatening the speaking
subject with uninhabitable identifcation']{.underline}** (2006, xix),
given that a **[dissenter must choose silence over being labelled
treasonous or communist or some other label that has an unbreakable
identifcation]{.underline}** with evil in contemporary Western political
performance.This catch-22, Butler argues, limits not only what we can
hear, what we can see and what we can mourn, but also how we live, which
she frames (in Levinas' terms) as 'the surplus of every sociality over
every solitude' (2006, 128). Butler argues that it is the
over-infusement and policing of meaning, which serves not only the
performative function of constituting human experience as such but also
the regulatory function of rendering uninhabitable (deemed) unacceptable
political space.Trans\* theorizing has suggested that the trans\* is
treated as such an uninhabitable space that is nonetheless
inhabited. **[Most of that discussion takes place in terms of outness
and visibility. Being 'out' is a (controversial) concept that, in
gay/queer/trans\* communities, discusses the acknowledgment of one's
gender identity/sexuality/sexual preference to one's friends, family, or
community]{.underline}**. In trans\* theorizing, th**[e controversy can
be even stronger, because some would argue that being 'out' is a
contradiction for the trans\* because it implies something
'in']{.underline}**---a secret, or hidden truth.A trans\* man is a man,
there's no outness as trans\* because the trans\* is not an essential
part of the person's identity as a man---**[it is not a secret, or a
hidden truth, but just an identity]{.underline}**. Others suggest that
outness requires an audience, but 'it is common, that is, for non-trans
people to neither know or care about the existence of trans-people'
(Shotwell and Sangray 2009, 59).This sometimes-invisibility, though, is
paired with a sometimes-hypervisibility. Hypervisible things are things
that are the object of gaze, fascination and/or sensationalism and
abjection. In these contexts, Butler (1993, 227) characterized outness
as a class privilege, looking for who has outness as 'a historically
available and affordable option'. On the one hand, some people and
actors in global politics have the privilege of the visibility of the
'true' self, and others cannot or will not be heard (e.g., Spivak 1988).
On the other hand, if visibility can be a privilege, **[hypervisibility
can be deeply problematic and frequently dangerous]{.underline}**.
Moreno (2008, 140--141) suggests that there are 'different dimensions of
(in)visibility as an analytical category,' including the
individual/collective dichotomy, the universal/particular dichotomy and
questions of cultural representation. In Moreno's (2008) analysis,
'group "outness" might actually present a condition of impossibility for
individual "outness" or individual counternarratives to the dominant
group narrative' (Sjoberg 2012). If being trans\* is the process of
becoming or recognizing **[who one is rather than changing who one is,
then the visibility of a trans\* narrative]{.underline}** would be
problematic for the experiences of individual trans\* persons.
Furthermore, visibility as trans\* has been argued to 'reinscribe the
position that genitalia are the essential determinants of sex' (Bettcher
2007, 50) by suggesting that some transformation is necessary to make
someone with female sex organs into a man, rather than recognizing that
the person was always and already a man.'Trans-theorists express concern
that the continued emphasis on difference between how trans-people look
and what they "are" is "fundamental to transphobic representations"'
(Sjoberg 2012, 345; citing Bettcher 2007, 50). **[It is precisely the
understanding that there is something to see/make visible in the trans\*
that creates a politics of hypervisibility of the
trans\*.]{.underline}** What happens is that 'visibility yields a
position in which what one is doing is represented as make-believe'
while 'to opt for invisibility ... generates the effect of revelation,
exposure, or hidden truth' (Bettcher 2007, 50).Visibility creates
hypervisibility, which leads to the potential for the violent
enforcement of sameness; invisibility creates silence, which leads to
the potential for the violent assumption of sameness. In other words,
there are violences of invisibility/exclusion (Bettcher 2007) and
violences of hypervisibility/inclusion (Haritaworn, Kuntsman and Posocco
2013) that trans\* theory both illuminates and provides some instruction
for navigating. Sometimes, placing a person in a group (e.g.,'citizens'
or 'patriots') creates a set of expectations of that person which might
feel as unnatural as exclusion if not more so (e.g., particular
behaviours or observations). Demands for conformity with dress, values
and/or behaviours pressure those who are included, with sometimes
violent results. **[So what implications for ethics in global politics
can be found in this discussion of visibility? First, it contributes a
suggestion that our interpretation of visibility for ethics purposes
should be more complicated]{.underline}**.Visibility and recognition are
often either implicitly or explicitly considered in dichotomous
terms---where someone (or someone's rights, or someone's status) is
either seen or unseen, recognized or unrecognized.Trans\* theorizing
suggests that there are several more statuses---in addition to visible
and invisible, there are situations of hypervisibility; situations of
outness but invisibility; situations of visibility without outness.
These statuses are not only applicable to trans\* bodies in global
politics; there are many complicated situations of not only who and what
can be seen, but of what the material and ethical implications of
visibility are/can be.A potential application of these expanded
categories might be in the debate and discussion about when/if confict
sexual violence is invisible (e.g., Henry 2010; MacKinnon 2006), and
when/if confict sexual violence is too visible (e.g., Buss 2007;
Eisenstein 2003). Both/and (e.g., Weber 2016)
hypervisibility/invisibility can and do coexist, and that complication
is necessary for ethical analysis of seeing/recognizing confict sexual
violence (see, e.g., my discussion in Sjoberg 2016). **[Second, trans\*
theorizing's contributions to thinking about visibility suggests that
ethical analysis about global politics needs to take account of the
moral implications of different visibilities in more complicated
ways]{.underline}**.T**[hinking about visibility and recognition as
ethical goods is]{.underline}** (and must be) **[oversimplifed. Instead,
it is important to start asking questions about what it means to be
seen]{.underline}**, what dimensions of a person or group are seen, who
benefts from and who is harmed by certain recognitions, and what
implications about naturalness and truth are inherent in any given
visibility and/or invisibility. In trans\* theorizing, the recognition
as 'really an x' or 'really a y' can be either liberating (when the 'x'
or 'y' matches the person's understanding of self and recognition is
desirable), mundane or annoying (when the 'x' or 'y' matches the
person's understanding of self, but blending in is more desirable), or
torturous and violent (when the 'x' or 'y' does not match the person's
understanding of self).All of these are different moral situations, with
different moral implications that need to be evaluated. **[Finally,
trans\* theorizing about visibility framing 'outness' or
even]{.underline}** (contingent) **[truth as a privilege suggests for
ethics in global politics that revisiting the debate about what voices
can be heard]{.underline}** (e.g., Spivak 1988) **[and how the
invisibility of certain persons and/or groups in global politics affects
the dimensions that ethical thinkers see in the problems that they
analyze]{.underline}** (e.g., Hansen 2000). **[It is not just that some
voices are seen and heard and others are not, it is also that the seeing
and hearing of some voices costs those voices, especially in certain
situations of external consumption. So two dimensions are important to
consider: which voices are being heard,]{.underline}** and what are the
costs of visibility to marginalized voices in global politics? How are
the costs of visibility to be factored into thinking about diversity,
rights and security when substantive ethical calculations are to be had?
While it is beyond the scope of this chapter to resolve these questions,
they are questions that trans\* theorizing inspires with broad
applicability to ethical thinking in global politics.

# 2AC\-\--AT: Queer IR

#### Queer IR [doesn't explain international relations.]{.underline} 

**Currah 14** --- Paisley Currah, Professor of Political Science and
Gender Studies at Brooklyn College, 2014 ("The State," *TSQ: Transgender
Studies Quarterly,* Vol. 1, No. 1-2, Accessible Online via e-Duke
Journals Scholarly Collection, Accessed On 07-13-2016)

According to Gilles Deleuze, a concept ''should express an event rather
than an essence'' (1995: 14). Molar, **[large-scale accounts of sex and
the state have assumed a sameness to sex and a singular rationality to
state actors, decisions, and projects. If the state is not unitary,
coordinated, and hierarchically organized in an ultimately rational
way]{.underline}**---if, as Michel Foucault suggests, ''the state is
only a composite reality and a mythicized abstraction whose importance
is much less than we think'' (1991: 103)--- **[then it should come as no
surprise that state definitions of sex are also plural]{.underline}**. A
contradiction is something that does not make sense, a position that is
logically inconsistent. To begin by letting go of the assumption that
there is any ''there there,'' any whatness, to (legal) sex apart from
what an agency says it is, the contradiction evaporates. **[The official
sex designation]{.underline}**---or, more precisely, the M or the F---
**[stamped on documents or coded in records becomes the starting point.
Then an analysis can focus not on what sex is, or what it should be, but
on what it does, what it accomplishes, what it produces.]{.underline}**
Indeed, if **[the only thing we know for sure about sex is what any of
these many state actors say it is in any particular instance, sex will
turn out to be as messy and diffuse a concept as the state. Entering
into the analysis without a firm sense of what sex is or what the state
is---as a priori facts, as edifices---makes the processes through which
they come into being more visible. It might be better to defer attempts
to resolve--- theoretically or politically--- the messiness in order to
understand what a particular system of sex designation does for a
particular state project such as recognition or
redistribution]{.underline}** (Currah, forthcoming). Of course, states
should not only or always be imagined as messy, scattered nodes of local
and arbitrary power arrangements. The Leviathan state's terrible
concentrated authority to impose sanctions (death, imprisonment, fines)
has been the subject of theories of sovereignty for centuries. For this
purpose, the most apt definition of the state begins with the simple
description from Max Weber: ''A human community that (successfully)
claims the monopoly of the legitimate physical violence within a
particular given territory'' (1991: 78). To create a truly compelling
account of sovereign violence and the paradox of sovereignty, one must
take Weber's definition, put question marks around ''legitimate,'' and
add the observation made by scholars such as Walter Benjamin, Carl
Schmitt, Hannah Arendt, Jacques Derrida, and Giorgio Agamben that the
force that creates the law and makes it legitimate cannot be justified
by a law that does not yet exist. Still, **[much of what states
do]{.underline}**--- regulating the health, safety, and public welfare
through myriad regulations, rules, decisions, practices--- **[does not
reach the threshold of juridical violence, even if those actions are
ultimately undergirded by its threat. Fetishizing a generalized idea of
the state and its terrifying or redemptive power]{.underline}**
(depending on one's perspective) **[can obscure what is actually
happening in the local, micro, particular sites where most public
authority is exercised. While it is crucial to theorize the singular
finality of state violence, neglecting to examine the messiness of
actually existing and potentially incommensurate policies, practices,
rules, and norms risks substituting the conceptual for the concrete and
gets in the way of understanding what might actually be going
on]{.underline}** (Latour 1995: 48).

IR." Duck of Minerva. 11/28/2018.

David Brook's latest column in the New York Times, banging on the same
themes about "the kids are just not right," raises some questions about
**[what it means to engage in radical politics in the Trump
era]{.underline}**. Brooks compares **[the]{.underline}** younger
generation's **[belief "that the system itself is rotten and needs to be
torn down"]{.underline}** to accomodationist and gradualisms. He
continues on to speculate about how these new attitudes might affect
older, more "pragmatic," liberals who desire to work within the system.
Brooks, as usual, uses a conservative argument to position himself in
the "middle." **[I have been thinking]{.underline}** a lot **[about this
issue of "radicalism" contra arguments about working within systems that
are unjust in thinking about liberal world order and its
futures]{.underline}**. It has led me to a question **[I
am]{.underline}** currently **[exploring]{.underline}** in a
work-in-progress about what **[the possibilities]{.underline}** are
**[of radicalism as a way of approaching international
politics]{.underline}**. Against arguments like Brooks', and even more
sophisticated arguments about agonistic democracy developed by thinkers
like Chantal Mouffe, I think **[there is a place in IR for radical
conceptions of transformation, order, and politics]{.underline}**.
**[What is radicalism?]{.underline}** Brooks never fully fleshes out
this concept. **[Philosophy and political theory have engaged with the
issue of radicalism as a concept, though the results are often
divergent]{.underline}**. To quote Agnes Heller, in her treatise on
**[radical philosophy]{.underline}**, it "**[can give the world a norm,
and it can will people to want to give a world to the
norm]{.underline}**." **[Radicalism as an idea, and as a form of
critique, mobilizes many different modes of thinking about the social
and the political]{.underline}**. The most comprehensive definition of
radicalism is that provided by Paul **[McLaughlin]{.underline}**, who
**[defines radicalism]{.underline}** "**[in terms of]{.underline}** (i)
**[a fundamental orientation]{.underline}** (toward fundamental objects)
(ii) **[in the political domain]{.underline}** (iii) **[of an
argumentative nature]{.underline}**." More than that, though, we can add
that **[radicalism intervenes in the political domain with the goal of
fundamental transformation]{.underline}**. Additionally, **[though
radicalism]{.underline}** indeed **[proceeds in an argumentative nature,
this methodology for argument is one that is aimed at critiquing, and
seeking the destruction/replacement of existing
institutions]{.underline}**. **[A revised]{.underline}** working
**[definition of radicalism]{.underline}**, therefore, **[is: a way of
thinking about politics that focuses on totalities, praxis and political
action, and the deployment of historicist methods with an eye toward
"getting to the root of things."]{.underline}** Thus, **[radicalism is
both a broad range of critical thought and practice, but also is
specific in the realms of focus, action, and method]{.underline}**. If
Brooks is right that there is a major clash between a radical younger
generation and a more pragmatic and moderate older generation in
American politics, these differences are not well expressed in
contemporary thinking about IR. **[Some of the biggest divisions are
between]{.underline}** what Robert Cox called **["problem-solving
theories"]{.underline}** **[and theories that critique such approaches,
but provide little argumentation aimed at tearing structures of
injustice down altogether]{.underline}**. **[In short: IR, even at its
critical ends, is not radical]{.underline}** (for an excellent exception
see here and here). **[Why is this important?]{.underline}** This
morning, I taught a seminar on the question "Is Liberal World Order
Finished?" **[I asked my students to think about what makes a liberal
order "liberal," and then asked: "Can we fix the liberal world order, or
can we imagine a world without it?]{.underline}**---**[and what would
that look like?]{.underline}**" **[The students were quick to point out
the violences, inequities, and problems inherent in a liberal world
order, but]{.underline}** **[it took a good bit of pushing and prodding
to get them to articulate whether/how we should/could take this order
apart and rethink it]{.underline}**. **[This was not just a difficult
task for the students---it is something IR has not spent enough time
meditating on]{.underline}**.

**[There is a lot to be critical of these days]{.underline}**. And, I
disagree with Brooks's pessimism about a younger radical generation.
**[Politics is deeply intertwined with engagements with
radicalism]{.underline}**. **[What]{.underline}** I think **[is
missing]{.underline}** **[when we consider global
politics]{.underline}**, though, **[is that many of our pressing
questions about institutions, order, and state action proceed from the
same sort of moderation, accomodationism, or---at the most---an
immanently critical vein]{.underline}**. If **[we want to intellectually
and politically approach issues]{.underline}** like: **[What do we make
of the future(s) of liberal world order?]{.underline}** IR needs to
engage with radicalism.

#### Alt fails---Trump era cemented heteronormative views within politics, cooption inevitable

**Weber 16** (Cynthia Weber, Professor of International Relations at the

Queer IR Analysis And Response," 11-27-2016, accessed 07-21-2022,

**[Crucially, the Trump campaign didn't just roll out its vision of this
'US sovereign subject' by employing either/or logics,]{.underline}**
even though much of the time this seemed to be the case. Yes, Trump
pitted 'trustworthy' and 'untrustworthy' US citizens against one
another. But **[he constantly flip flopped on who these trustworthy and
untrustworthy citizens were, whether in the case of women, 'the blacks'
or the first black President]{.underline}** of the United States of
America**[. The campaign also rolled out Mike Pence to deny many of the
things Trump said. And Trump made a lot of inherently contradictory
statements that suggested he was for and against some groups or policies
at the same time. For example, Trump said, 'There can be no
discrimination against gays. I'm against gay
marriage']{.underline}** (although in his 60 Minutes interview, Trump
said gay marriage was a legally settled issue). **[Trump also made
inconsistent statements about the anti-trans\* bathroom
law]{.underline}** in North Carolina. **[Comments like these were
implicitly and explicitly made in the register of sex, gender and
sexuality throughout the campaign, and they were more consistent with
and/or logics and neither/nor logics than they were with either/or
logics. These statements demonstrate how some of ]{.underline}the
paradoxical figures and logics found in queer discourses were
coopted[ by the Trump campaign for its own purposes. All of this left
many politicians, pundits, and ordinary US American citizens wondering
if Trump was a clown who should be laughed off or an existential threat
to the American democratic project. Trump positioned himself as either
and both and even neither as it suited his ambitions. And he will likely
continue to do so]{.underline}** as the 45th President of the United
States. **[What is to be done?]{.underline}** As the US and the world
face up to the realities of the impossible Presidency that the Trump
campaign made possible, **[there is no shortage of recommendations
circulating in critical camps about what is to be done. These include:
Organizing new coalitions and devising experimental techniques to make
them effective; ]{.underline}Disarming[ the ]{.underline}specific
modalities of citizenship, governance and reason[ that make
(un)reasonable identifications with a will to Trump possible;
and ]{.underline}Resisting all[ xenophobias, forms
of ]{.underline}racism[, ]{.underline}misogyny[, ]{.underline}homo/bi/trans\*phobias[,
and other oppressive ideologies and social relations that violently
order the world in whatever name -- be it ]{.underline}white
supremacy[, ]{.underline}rightwing nationalism[, conservatism,
or ]{.underline}neoliberalism[. I am less hopeful]{.underline}** than
Joan Cocks might be **[that these new political alliances and
institutions will be forged 'without sovereign aspirations, delusions,
or pretensions',]{.underline} whatever their scale[. And I may be more
persuaded]{.underline}** than Cocks **[is that the counter-Trump
re-imaginings of the US that will support these political alliances and
institutions are ]{.underline}an essential part of what makes radical
change possible, even if these re-imaginings fail to escape the
'delusion of sovereignty' and its corresponding delusions of things like
sex, gender and sexuality[. This, it seems to me,
is something]{.underline} Trump's radical re-imagining of the US as his
platform for winning the White House underscores**. As we all move
forward and ready ourselves for some difficult conversations, **[this
queer IR analysis suggests we keep the following two points in
mind]{.underline}**. First, connections between sovereignty, sex, gender
and sexuality are neither academic nor trivial. Nor are they separable
from racisms, xenophobias and other systems of power. How sovereignties
are specifically sexualized, racialized, classed and otherwise
configured to authorize the defense of particular nationalisms and
internationalisms has real effects on real people. This is as true in
relation to the hate speech and physical violence authorized in the name
of Trump as it is for the policies that will emerge from a Trump
administration. Second, **exclusively anti-normative, always contrarian,
somehow liberating understandings[ of 'queer', 'queers', and 'queer
logics' can ]{.underline}obscure[ the fact that 'queer' -- just
like ]{.underline}any (dis)position, strategy, or tool -- can be
captured, mimicked, and mobilized[ to map the world in despicable
ways. ]{.underline}Alt-Right[ offers one important example of a white
supremacist organization ]{.underline}adopting techniques of the
left[ for such purposes. How the Trump campaign ]{.underline}mobilized
what (otherwise) might appear to be queer logics of statecraft to
de-normalize Clinton's 'neoliberal US sovereign subject' on behalf of
Trump's (re)normalized 'repressed, entitled, white US sovereign
subject'[ is another. ]{.underline}There is no reason to believe that,
as President, Trump will abandon the very logics and tactics that helped
win[ him the Presidency]{.underline}**. These are among the stakes a
queer IR analysis of a will to Trump makes plain. For me, **opposing a
will to Trump[ starts by reminding myself that -- like 'queer' -- a
'state's sovereign subjectivity is..."\[i\]llusive, always on the
move]{.underline}**." It is "at best like something, but it never is
that something"'. Trump is of some ever-changing United States of
America, but Trump is not the United States of America. The same can be
said of the 'US sovereign subject' Trump's campaign strategically
figured to authorize Trump's will to power. **[It is in these gaps and
fissures where I will pitch my political tent and stage
my ]{.underline}practical political resistance[ to a will to
Trump.]{.underline}**

Although he/she stands as an emblem of Cynthia's hope for pluralizing
the monolithic concept of sovereign man and for queering an integrated
Europe, I'm going to gesture only briefly to the border-straddling
Eurovision song contest winner Neuwirth/Wurst. I have to confess that
I've never watched Eurovision and so must trust Cynthia's reading of N/W
entirely, but as she depicts him/her, unlike the normal homosexual, this
bearded lady from Austria and Colombia managed to provoke wildly
clashing reactions from leaders and peoples in different countries and
of different political stripes by impaling him/herself on the border of
masculine and feminine, the Global North and Global South, secularism
and religion, white and brown racial identities, and national
particularity and regional integration. Still, while Cynthia's layered
reading of N/W is as sophisticated an interpretation of identity
deconstruction as any cultural theorist could hope for, **[a performance
of ambiguities in identity on stage]{.underline}**, **[and the parsing
of those ambiguities in a queer IR theory text]{.underline}**, **[can
push the world forward]{.underline}** (or, to the minds of N/W's
critics, backward) **[only so far]{.underline}**.

In summarizing some of these themes, controversies and tensions, [I am
unavoidably reading queer theory as an IR scholar steeped in a
literature that, for the most part, has not accepted and has even been
actively hostile to a 'queer IR']{.underline} (Weber 2014b).
Nevertheless, [an **intersection of queer and 'dominant' IR is
potentially fruitful**, but it is not a matter of 'mixing and stirring'
since the **queer has been relevant to IR and world politics all
along**, in its dominant narratives of discipline as they extend through
the halls of power]{.underline}, products of media and culture, and the
offices, conference rooms [and journals of the field of International
Relations]{.underline} (Weber 2013; 2014a, 2014b; Wilcox 2015). In other
words, [I am interrogating IR]{.underline} from a body of literature
that has become known as 'queer theory' [but this effort should not be
read as a neglect of the ways in which a growing contingent of IR
scholars have read world politics through a queer lens to make up a rich
variety of critical and innovative approaches]{.underline}
