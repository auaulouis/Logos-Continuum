[Whether a]{.underline} conviction under this [statute
requires]{.underline} possession of **[all]{.underline}** ([as opposed

Possibilities, P.S.C., 207 F.3d 335, 338-39 (6th Cir. 2000) HN9 (\"The
starting point in a statutory interpretation case is the language of the
statute itself.\"). Obviously, the multiple manufacturing methods and
the availability of a broad range of readily available chemicals and
equipment necessary for each manufacturing process militates against
itemizing within the statute all of the possible chemical and equipment
combinations by which methamphetamine could be manufactured.
Nevertheless, KRS 218A.1432(1)(b) does not read \"\[p\]ossesses
chemicals or equipment,\" or \"\[p\]ossesses some of the chemicals or

why the U.S. should ditch Turkey as a military partner," Responsible
Statecraft,
<https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2021/11/23/eight-reasons-why-the-u-s-should-ditch-turkey-as-a-military-partner/)//BB>

Turkish President Recep Tayyip [Erdogan has transformed his country and
its relationship with America]{.underline} --- but **[not for the
better]{.underline}**. President Donald Trump's personal ties to Erdogan
may have disguised the widening divergence in interests, but [a chasm
has now truly opened between the two governments]{.underline},
**[requiring a much tougher approach toward Ankara]{.underline}** than
in the past. The Republic of Turkey grew out of the ramshackle Ottoman
Empire, which collapsed at the end of World War I. Ankara joined NATO in
1952, controlling access to the Black Sea and serving as the alliance's
southeast foundation. [The Pentagon was always Ankara's strongest
booster]{.underline}, since Incirlik and Izmir Air Bases extended
Washington's military reach in the Middle East. Turkey also was
presented as a model of Islamic democracy, despite the military's
ruthless intervention in the illiberal political system, staging soft
and hard coups, and invading the Republic of Cyprus in 1974. For
America, the Cold War was more important than human rights. Erdogan's
Justice and Development Party (AKP) won the 2002 election and began to
transform Turkey. After a decade of modest reform and good press,
Erdogan turned Turkey in an authoritarian, corrupt, and Islamist
direction. Repression accelerated after a failed coup in July 2016,
months before Trump was elected, provided Erdogan with a Turkish version
of the Reichstag fire. [Freedom House rates Turkey as not
free]{.underline}, reporting that the government "has pursued a dramatic
and wide-ranging crackdown on perceived opponents" since that attempted
coup event. Based on scant evidence, Erdogan accused the Hizmet
movement's Fethullah Gulen of being behind the putsch. He has tried, but
so far unsuccessfully, to have Gulen extradited from his exile in
Pennsylvania. [Erdogan then turned his country into a prison
state]{.underline}. Even the slightest connection --- teaching at a
Hizmet school, or using a bank owned by a Hizmet member --- resulted in
dismissal, arrest, and/or imprisonment. Journalists and opposition
politicians remain frequent targets, especially when Erdogan's poll
ratings dip. Reported Freedom House: Opposition gains and economic
troubles "have given the government new incentives to suppress dissent
and limit public discourse." Moreover, [Turkish foreign policy is
**increasingly at odds** with U.S. policy]{.underline}. The challenge is
not that [Erdogan]{.underline} is taking independent positions, but
rather **[is actively undermining U.S. policies]{.underline}**. [Among
the problem areas:]{.underline} One: **[Treating]{.underline}** another
**[NATO]{.underline}** ally, Greece, and a European Union member,
Cyprus, **[as adversaries]{.underline}**. Unhappy over Greece's
possession of islands near Turkey's coast, Ankara refuses to recognize
Greek airspace and territorial waters, leading to dangerous military
confrontations. The Erdogan government continues to resist efforts to
end the partition of Cyprus and interfere with efforts by the
internationally recognized government of Cyprus to develop nearby
hydrocarbons. Some observers fear a Turkish-Greco war. Two: [Forging a
military relationship with Russia]{.underline}. Ankara purchased
Moscow's S-400 air defense system, resulting in Turkey's ouster from the
F-35 program. The Erdogan government plans to buy additional S-400
missiles. Turkey also has reached accommodations with Moscow involving
Syria and other regional issues, though the two governments' alignment
is not perfect. Erdogan has negatively contrasted his relationship with
President Joe Biden to that with Putin. Ozgur Unluhisarcikli of the
German Marshall Fund opined that Erdogan seeks "a counterbalancing
alliance with Russia against the US." [If Ankara was forced to choose
between NATO and Russia in a conflict, the allies could not be confident
that Turkey would fulfill its alliance commitments]{.underline}. Three:
[Adopting a]{.underline}n expansive, neo-Ottoman [maritime
doctrine]{.underline} known as Blue Homeland, [which seeks to dominate
the Mediterranean]{.underline}. Once stuck at the policymaking fringe,
this strategy envisions controlling waters claimed by Greece, Cyprus,
Egypt, and Israel. Clashes over contending territorial claims have
increased chances of violent confrontation. Ankara's desire to
strengthen its maritime position spurred its intervention in Libya's
civil war. Four: [Arming Azerbaijan and encouraging it to restart
hostilities with Armenia over the disputed territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh]{.underline}. The result was a bitter fight and
abundant war crimes. There were unverified claims that Ankara shot down
an Armenian aircraft and deployed Syrian mercenaries on Azerbaijan's
behalf. A side impact was to deepen Russia's role. Five: [Intervening in
Libya's civil war]{.underline}. Ankara backed the Islamist Tripoli-based
Government of National Accord, violating the United Nations weapons
embargo. Turkish vessels confronted French and German ships tasked with
preventing arms smuggling. In return the Tripoli authorities accepted a
maritime boundary agreement privileging Ankara in waters also claimed by
Greece and Cyprus. Six: [Treating the Islamic State and other radical
groups operating in Syria as]{.underline} co-belligerents if not
[allies]{.underline}. Ankara brazenly facilitated ISIS border crossings
and oil sales; charges of corruption tainted Erdogan's family. Even Vice
President Joe Biden inconveniently acknowledged Ankara's role. Seven:
[Targeting the Kurdish-dominated People's Defense Units]{.underline}, or
YPG, in Syria. The Erdogan government twice invaded Syrian Kurdish
territory, utilizing U.S.-supplied weapons and employing jihadist forces
previously active elsewhere in Syria. Amnesty International cited "a
shameful disregard for civilian life, carrying out serious violations
and war crimes, including summary killings and unlawful attacks that
have killed and injured civilians, during the offensive into northeast
Syria." The YPG was Washington's main ally fighting ISIS on the ground,
yet Ankara is threatening to invade again. Eight: Using Syrian fighters
as mercenaries via private military companies, in particular, the SADAT
International Defense Consultancy, to meddle in conflicts abroad,
including Libya and the Caucasus. These forces are essentially
accountable to no one. Despite this terrible record, Ankara's ambassador
to the US, Hasan Murat Mercan, recently argued that "Turkey stands as a
reliable ally that can deliver at the moment of crisis --- a friend in
need." However, policy differences have been exacerbated by Erdogan's
personal hostility. He recently went before the Turkish National
Assembly to denounce "those who ignored our country in the region for
years --- and confronted us with maps and demands that would imprison us
into our coasts --- irst tried the language of threat and blackmail
after the steps we took." Moreover, Erdogan's ambitions have grown
increasingly radical. As he told the National Assembly: "There is no
chance left for this distorted order, in which the entire globe is
encumbered by a handful of greedy people, to continue to exist the way
it currently does." There was little doubt about who he meant. [The
greater his domestic political problems, the more **aggressive** his
foreign policy is likely to become. Which is dangerous to the
US]{.underline}. In 2015 the Erdogan government recklessly downed a
Russian warplane that briefly entered Turkish airspace. Had Russia's
Vladimir Putin responded with force America and Europe could have ended
up at war. Today Moscow's and [Ankara's]{.underline} respective
[proxies]{.underline}, the Syrian government, and Idlib-area insurgents,
[also]{.underline} could [spark a conflict]{.underline}. So could
**[Ankara's increasingly aggressive activities]{.underline}** elsewhere
--- North Africa, Mediterranean, Mideast, and Central Asia --- which
often **[are at variance with NATO's interest]{.underline}**. Turkey's
band of American friends is diminishing. Some are stuck in the past,
remembering the ally Ankara once was. Other analysts prefer to wait for
Erdogan's passage across the River Styx, given rumors about his health.
However, in two decades he would still be younger than Joe Biden. The
political waters at home have grown rougher, but so far he has
surmounted every challenge with increasing force. Nor would a new
president and parliamentary majority necessarily transform Ankara's
policies. Turkish public opinion is nationalistic, conspiracy-minded,
and ever more hostile toward the U.S. Indeed, a recent poll found that
six of ten Turks viewed America as the greatest threat to Turkey,
compared to just 19 percent who fingered Russia. Today Ankara could not
enter the transatlantic alliance. [Washington should minimize its
reliance on Turkey]{.underline} and the latter's threat to U.S.
interests. [The U.S. should]{.underline} remove its nuclear weapons
stored at Incirlik Air Base, and **[downgrade]{.underline}** use of the
facility, access to which remains under Erdogan's erratic control. If
Washington intervened in the Mideast less often, the base would matter
less. In any case, there are alternatives: In response to **[Ankara's
policies]{.underline}** U.S.-Greek military ties have recently expanded.
[The Pentagon should]{.underline} limit arm sales,
**[build]{.underline}**ing **[on the F-35]{.underline}** sales
**[ban]{.underline}**. Finally, the [Biden]{.underline} administration
**[should]{.underline}** begin NATO discussions on options ranging from
**[limit]{.underline}**ing **[Turkey's role in]{.underline}**
decision-making to ousting Ankara from **[the transatlantic
alliance]{.underline}**. Two months ago Erdogan admitted: "I cannot say
that a healthy process is running in Turkish-American ties." Yet
[Washington's policy reflects the continuing illusion that Turkey
remains a **loyal and reliable** U.S. ally]{.underline}, European
partner, [and NATO member]{.underline}. **[None of these are
true]{.underline}**. **[A change in policy is long
overdue]{.underline}**.

of its own creation. The alliance worried more about using Turkey as a

strategic Bosporus strait closed under the 1936 Montreux Convention and
keep the Russian Black Sea Fleet bottled up in the Black Sea. [NATO
looked the other way while Erdoğan purged the Turkish armed forces of

critical media just like]{.underline} Vladimir [Putin]{.underline}. [Our
NATO ally]{.underline} supports the SADAT paramilitary organization that
spreads jihadism across the Islamic world, not unlike Russia's Wagner
paramilitary group that acts on behalf of Putin's interests. It
[**militarily threatens** neighboring fellow NATO member Greece and has
repeatedly invaded Syria]{.underline}. Blinken warned Turkey against
further military operations in Syria on June 1. Kurdish activists accuse
Ankara of systematic ethnic cleansing. Turkish agents have abducted
followers of exiled Turkish Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen from around
the world and brought them back to Turkey in the wake of the July 2016
"false-flag" coup attempt. Gülen and his followers have been strong
opponents of Erdoğan's policies. Erdoğan has played both sides of the
fence with Russia for the past decade. On one side there was the Turkey
that shot down a Russian jet in 2015 and sold Ukraine the Bayraktar
drones manufactured by a company owned by Erdoğan's son-in-law. On the
other hand, you had the Turkey that went out of its way to annoy its
NATO partners by purchasing the formidable Russian S-400 anti-aircraft
missile system. The alliance helped enable the development of the
current impasse by turning a blind eye to Turkey's covert backing of
ISIS and al-Qaida jihadists that necessitated the use of Kurdish
fighters to push back ISIS. Turkish National Intelligence (MIT) helped
tens of thousands of al-Qaida and later ISIS jihadists cross its
territory to fight in Syria and also trained them. NATO also helped
create the refugee flow from Syria by arming and supporting the uprising
against Assad starting in 2011. NATO aircraft reportedly ferried Libyan
arms to Turkey from Libya starting in late 2011 with covert support from
the Obama administration. "[Turkey's antidemocratic nature **isn't just
a bad look** for an alliance that claims to be grounded in democratic
principles. It **also undermines NATO's security**.]{.underline} [Turkey
wields its veto within the alliance **like a cudgel**, slamming its
allies **on unrelated issues** to punish it]{.underline} for not
validating Erdoğan's obsession with punishing the Kurds. Erdoğan is in
it for what Erdoğan wants --- and that frequently doesn't align with the
alliance's interest and security," former U.S. diplomat Elizabeth
Shackelford wrote in the Chicago Tribune. The alliance's charter makes
it impossible for it to suspend or expel a member; consequently,
[Erdoğan believes he can **act with impunity** and **hold the alliance
hostage**]{.underline}. Kurdish activist Hadi Elis accuses NATO of being
anti-Kurdish. "\[It\] acts in accordance with Turkish policies against
Iraqi and Syrian Kurds," Elis told me. "\[The\] Western coalition ...
started putting distance between themselves and Kurds, because Turkey
was using all trade and other ties to give them hard times. No one
wanted to confront Turkey's anti-Kurdish policies." [It's time the
alliance **took a stand** against Turkey's bad behavior]{.underline},
especially now that the Turks are threatening their third invasion of
Syria in eight years. The West has relied on Syria's PKK-linked People's
Defense Units (YPG in Kurdish) to keep ISIS in check. The YPG-led Syrian
Democratic Forces (SDF) warn that ISIS is coming back in Syria, and a
Turkish invasion would only destabilize and oppress the Kurds and Syriac
Christians who live in the proposed buffer area along Turkey's border
with Syria. The commander of Kurdish forces said he would turn to the
Assad regime should Turkey invade. "[The]{.underline} [justifications
for **appeasing Erdogan** have never served NATO well, and made it
**more difficult to constrain other rogue actors** and to **retain

#### The impact is global WMD conflict

**Burke-White 4**, Lecturer in Public and International Affairs and
Senior Special Assistant to the Dean at the Woodrow Wilson School of
Public and International Affairs, Princeton University and Ph.D. at
Cambridge (William, "Human Rights and National Security: The Strategic
Correlation," *The Harvard Human Rights Journal*, 17)//BB

For most of the past fifty years, U.S. foreign policymakers have largely
viewed the promotion of human rights and the protection of national
security as in inherent tension. Almost without exception, each
administration has treated the two goals as mutually exclusive: promote
human rights at the expense of national security or protect national
security while overlooking international human rights. While U.S.
policymakers have been motivated at times by human rights concerns, such
concerns have generally been subordinate to national security. For
example, President Bush's 2002 U.S. National Security Strategy speaks of
a "commitment to protecting basic human rights." In the same document,
President Bush makes it clear that "defending our Nation against its
enemies is the first and fundamental commitment of the Federal
Government."1 This [subordination of human rights to national security
is both **unnecessary** and **strategically questionable**]{.underline}.
[A more effective U.S. foreign policy would view human rights and
national security as **correlated**]{.underline} and complementary
**[goals]{.underline}**. [Better protection of human rights around the
world would make the United States safer and more secure]{.underline}.
The [United States needs to restructure its foreign policy
accordingly]{.underline}. This Article presents a strategic\--as opposed
to ideological or normative\--argument that the promotion of human
rights should be given a more prominent place in U.S. foreign policy. It
does so by suggesting a correlation between the domestic human rights
practices of states and their propensity to engage in aggressive
international conduct. Among the chief threats to U.S. national security
are acts of aggression by other states. Aggressive acts of war may
directly endanger the United States, as did the Japanese bombing of
Pearl Harbor in 1941, or they may require U.S. military action overseas,
as in Kuwait fifty years later. Evidence from the post-Cold War period
\[\*250\] indicates that states that systematically abuse their own
citizens\' human rights are also those most likely to engage in
aggression. To the degree that [improvements in]{.underline} various
[states\' human rights records **decrease the likelihood of aggressive
war**]{.underline}, [a foreign policy informed by human rights can
significantly enhance U.S. and global security]{.underline}. Since 1990,
a state\'s domestic human rights policy appears to be a telling
indicator of that state\'s propensity to engage in international
aggression. A central element of U.S. foreign policy has long been the
preservation of peace and the prevention of such acts of aggression. 2
If the correlation discussed herein is accurate, it provides U.S.
policymakers with a powerful new tool to enhance national security
through the promotion of human rights. A strategic
**[linkage]{.underline}** [between national security and human rights
would result in a number of important policy modifications]{.underline}.
First, it changes the prioritization of those countries U.S.
policymakers have identified as presenting the greatest concern. Second,
it alters some of the policy prescriptions for such states. Third, it
offers states a means of signaling benign international intent through
the improvement of their domestic human rights records. Fourth, [it
provides a way for a current government to prevent future governments
from aggressive international behavior through the institutionalization
of human rights protections]{.underline}. Fifth, [it addresses the
particular threat of human rights abusing states obtaining]{.underline}
weapons of mass destruction (**[WMD]{.underline}**). Finally, it offers
a mechanism for U.S.-U.N. cooperation on human rights issues.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip [Erdogan has transformed his country and
its relationship with America]{.underline} --- but **[not for the
better]{.underline}**. President Donald Trump's personal ties to Erdogan
may have disguised the widening divergence in interests, but [a chasm
has now truly opened between the two governments]{.underline},
**[requiring a much tougher approach toward Ankara]{.underline}** than
in the past. The Republic of Turkey grew out of the ramshackle Ottoman
Empire, which collapsed at the end of World War I. Ankara joined NATO in
1952, controlling access to the Black Sea and serving as the alliance's
southeast foundation. [The Pentagon was always Ankara's strongest
booster]{.underline}, since Incirlik and Izmir Air Bases extended
Washington's military reach in the Middle East. Turkey also was
presented as a model of Islamic democracy, despite the military's
ruthless intervention in the illiberal political system, staging soft
and hard coups, and invading the Republic of Cyprus in 1974. For
America, the Cold War was more important than human rights. Erdogan's
Justice and Development Party (AKP) won the 2002 election and began to
transform Turkey. After a decade of modest reform and good press,
Erdogan turned Turkey in an authoritarian, corrupt, and Islamist
direction. Repression accelerated after a failed coup in July 2016,
months before Trump was elected, provided Erdogan with a Turkish version
of the Reichstag fire. [Freedom House rates Turkey as not
free]{.underline}, reporting that the government "has pursued a dramatic
and wide-ranging crackdown on perceived opponents" since that attempted
coup event. Based on scant evidence, Erdogan accused the Hizmet
movement's Fethullah Gulen of being behind the putsch. He has tried, but
so far unsuccessfully, to have Gulen extradited from his exile in
Pennsylvania. [Erdogan then turned his country into a prison
state]{.underline}. Even the slightest connection --- teaching at a
Hizmet school, or using a bank owned by a Hizmet member --- resulted in
dismissal, arrest, and/or imprisonment. Journalists and opposition
politicians remain frequent targets, especially when Erdogan's poll
ratings dip. Reported Freedom House: Opposition gains and economic
troubles "have given the government new incentives to suppress dissent
and limit public discourse." Moreover, [Turkish foreign policy is
**increasingly at odds** with U.S. policy]{.underline}. The challenge is
not that [Erdogan]{.underline} is taking independent positions, but
rather **[is actively undermining U.S. policies]{.underline}**. [Among
the problem areas:]{.underline} One: **[Treating]{.underline}** another
**[NATO]{.underline}** ally, Greece, and a European Union member,
Cyprus, **[as adversaries]{.underline}**. Unhappy over Greece's
possession of islands near Turkey's coast, Ankara refuses to recognize
Greek airspace and territorial waters, leading to dangerous military
confrontations. The Erdogan government continues to resist efforts to
end the partition of Cyprus and interfere with efforts by the
internationally recognized government of Cyprus to develop nearby
hydrocarbons. Some observers fear a Turkish-Greco war. Two: [Forging a
military relationship with Russia]{.underline}. Ankara purchased
Moscow's S-400 air defense system, resulting in Turkey's ouster from the
F-35 program. The Erdogan government plans to buy additional S-400
missiles. Turkey also has reached accommodations with Moscow involving
Syria and other regional issues, though the two governments' alignment
is not perfect. Erdogan has negatively contrasted his relationship with
President Joe Biden to that with Putin. Ozgur Unluhisarcikli of the
German Marshall Fund opined that Erdogan seeks "a counterbalancing
alliance with Russia against the US." [If Ankara was forced to choose
between NATO and Russia in a conflict, the allies could not be confident
that Turkey would fulfill its alliance commitments]{.underline}. Three:
[Adopting a]{.underline}n expansive, neo-Ottoman [maritime
doctrine]{.underline} known as Blue Homeland, [which seeks to dominate
the Mediterranean]{.underline}. Once stuck at the policymaking fringe,
this strategy envisions controlling waters claimed by Greece, Cyprus,
Egypt, and Israel. Clashes over contending territorial claims have
increased chances of violent confrontation. Ankara's desire to
strengthen its maritime position spurred its intervention in Libya's
civil war. Four: [Arming Azerbaijan and encouraging it to restart
hostilities with Armenia over the disputed territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh]{.underline}. The result was a bitter fight and
abundant war crimes. There were unverified claims that Ankara shot down
an Armenian aircraft and deployed Syrian mercenaries on Azerbaijan's
behalf. A side impact was to deepen Russia's role. Five: [Intervening in
Libya's civil war]{.underline}. Ankara backed the Islamist Tripoli-based
Government of National Accord, violating the United Nations weapons
embargo. Turkish vessels confronted French and German ships tasked with
preventing arms smuggling. In return the Tripoli authorities accepted a
maritime boundary agreement privileging Ankara in waters also claimed by
Greece and Cyprus. Six: [Treating the Islamic State and other radical
groups operating in Syria as]{.underline} co-belligerents if not
[allies]{.underline}. Ankara brazenly facilitated ISIS border crossings
and oil sales; charges of corruption tainted Erdogan's family. Even Vice
President Joe Biden inconveniently acknowledged Ankara's role. Seven:
[Targeting the Kurdish-dominated People's Defense Units]{.underline}, or
YPG, in Syria. The Erdogan government twice invaded Syrian Kurdish
territory, utilizing U.S.-supplied weapons and employing jihadist forces
previously active elsewhere in Syria. Amnesty International cited "a
shameful disregard for civilian life, carrying out serious violations
and war crimes, including summary killings and unlawful attacks that
have killed and injured civilians, during the offensive into northeast
Syria." The YPG was Washington's main ally fighting ISIS on the ground,
yet Ankara is threatening to invade again. Eight: Using Syrian fighters
as mercenaries via private military companies, in particular, the SADAT
International Defense Consultancy, to meddle in conflicts abroad,
including Libya and the Caucasus. These forces are essentially
accountable to no one. Despite this terrible record, Ankara's ambassador
to the US, Hasan Murat Mercan, recently argued that "Turkey stands as a
reliable ally that can deliver at the moment of crisis --- a friend in
need." However, policy differences have been exacerbated by Erdogan's
personal hostility. He recently went before the Turkish National
Assembly to denounce "those who ignored our country in the region for
years --- and confronted us with maps and demands that would imprison us
into our coasts --- irst tried the language of threat and blackmail
after the steps we took." Moreover, Erdogan's ambitions have grown
increasingly radical. As he told the National Assembly: "There is no
chance left for this distorted order, in which the entire globe is
encumbered by a handful of greedy people, to continue to exist the way
it currently does." There was little doubt about who he meant. [The
greater his domestic political problems, the more **aggressive** his
foreign policy is likely to become. Which is dangerous to the
US]{.underline}. In 2015 the Erdogan government recklessly downed a
Russian warplane that briefly entered Turkish airspace. Had Russia's
Vladimir Putin responded with force America and Europe could have ended
up at war. Today Moscow's and [Ankara's]{.underline} respective
[proxies]{.underline}, the Syrian government, and Idlib-area insurgents,
also [could]{.underline} [spark a conflict]{.underline}. So could
**[Ankara's increasingly aggressive activities]{.underline}** elsewhere
--- North Africa, Mediterranean, Mideast, and Central Asia --- which
often **[are at variance with NATO's interest]{.underline}**. Turkey's
band of American friends is diminishing. Some are stuck in the past,
remembering the ally Ankara once was. Other analysts prefer to wait for
Erdogan's passage across the River Styx, given rumors about his health.
However, in two decades he would still be younger than Joe Biden. The
political waters at home have grown rougher, but so far he has
surmounted every challenge with increasing force. Nor would a new
president and parliamentary majority necessarily transform Ankara's
policies. Turkish public opinion is nationalistic, conspiracy-minded,
and ever more hostile toward the U.S. Indeed, a recent poll found that
six of ten Turks viewed America as the greatest threat to Turkey,
compared to just 19 percent who fingered Russia. Today Ankara could not
enter the transatlantic alliance. [Washington should minimize its
reliance on Turkey]{.underline} and the latter's threat to U.S.
interests. [The U.S. should]{.underline} remove its nuclear weapons
stored at Incirlik Air Base, and **[downgrade]{.underline}** use of the
facility, access to which remains under Erdogan's erratic control. If
Washington intervened in the Mideast less often, the base would matter
less. In any case, there are alternatives: In response to **[Ankara's
policies]{.underline}** U.S.-Greek military ties have recently expanded.
[The Pentagon should]{.underline} limit arm sales,

Partnerships, among people and nations, have a wide range of possible
meanings and scope. But [alliances are]{.underline} formal agreements
that indicate a specific kind of commitment, such as
[marriage]{.underline}. [An alliance is a promise between nations to
support and defend each other, in good times and bad, sickness and
health, or more specifically, peace time or war]{.underline}.

Alliances shouldn't be entered into casually, **[but]{.underline}** they
shouldn't be unalterable either. [If an alliance becomes an obstacle to
a nation's ability to secure its needs, the standards and path for
getting out should be clear and reasonable]{.underline}. [This brings me
to Turkey]{.underline}. As any real friend to **[NATO]{.underline}**
would, I have to ask: is Turkey today really the Turkey you were drawn
to as a partner 70 years ago? I fear you **[and Turkey have grown
apart]{.underline}**, [most recently with its]{.underline} threat to
**[block]{.underline}** NATO membership **[for Sweden and
Finland]{.underline}**. I worry the growing **[differences
are]{.underline}** becoming **[irreconcilable]{.underline}**. In the
early NATO days, Turkey was sitting on the border of the Soviet Union.
When stopping Soviet expansion was NATO's primary purpose, Turkey's
geography might have been compelling enough to overcome other
shortcomings. This was easy to do, too, given Turkey's potential at the
time. It seemed to be moving firmly toward a Western identity and
embracing liberal, democratic values that NATO saw within itself. As
often happens in relationships, that promise didn't turn out, and Turkey
saw coups and unrest in the coming decades. In 2002, the West thought
this time could be different, with the democratic election of Recep
Tayyip Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP), but the commitment
to democracy still wasn't real, and Turkey took a hard turn toward
illiberal, authoritarian rule. [Turkey's antidemocratic nature isn't
just a **bad look** for an alliance that claims to be grounded in
democratic principles. It also **undermines NATO's
security**]{.underline}. [Turkey wields its veto]{.underline} within the
alliance like a cudgel, [slamming its allies **on unrelated
issues**]{.underline} to punish it for not validating Erdogan's
obsession with punishing the Kurds. Erdogan is in it for [what Erdogan
wants]{.underline} --- and that frequently [doesn't align with the
alliance's interest and security]{.underline}. While they clash on
several issues, Erdogan is still close to Putin, as he tries to play
both sides. Turkey's purchase of Russian missile defense systems in 2019
was a slap in NATO's face and direct violation of U.S. sanctions. Can
Turkey still be trusted with NATO's weapons systems, or does Turkey's
snug relationship with Russia risk the compromise of classified NATO
weapons system information? [NATO, you can do better. Finland and Sweden
are courting you, after all]{.underline}. [Like Turkey, they have
capable, professional militaries and strategic geography, but they also
share]{.underline} your values, such as **[democracy and the rule of
law]{.underline}**. [You're not likely to catch Finland or Sweden
imprisoning political opponents or threatening journalists]{.underline}.
And [Erdogan's objection to]{.underline} the [accession of Finland and
Sweden raises the question of whose side Erdogan is on at]{.underline}
all. Other [NATO members have **long tired** of Turkey's duplicity and
games. This isn't the first time booting Turkey out of the alliance has
been a topic of debate]{.underline}. The possibility was raised after
Erdogan's harsh crackdown in 2016 following a failed coup attempt, as
well after Turkey invaded northeastern Syria in 2019. But since NATO has
no mechanism for suspending or expelling an ally, a path out isn't
clear. **[If the]{.underline}** rest of the **[alliance finds that
Turkey has consistently violated NATO principles]{.underline}**, [they
can]{.underline} unanimously agree to withdraw Article 5 protections
from Turkey, effectively **[suspend]{.underline}**ing its participation
and any **[assistance it receives from NATO]{.underline}**. **[This
is]{.underline}** probably **[the closest to divorce it can
get]{.underline}**, but even this determination would require a
clear-eyed assessment of the benefits Turkey brings to the table and the
risks too. Perhaps **[Turkey would]{.underline}** agree to a no-fault
divorce --- it can always **[choose to withdraw]{.underline}**. If not,
marriage counseling might be in order. No ally is the perfect ally, and
no spouse the perfect spouse. Some manner of compromise and
understanding is always necessary. It's ultimately up to
[NATO]{.underline} to decide whether Turkey is worth the formal defense
commitment, but it's a decision they [should **feel
empowered**]{.underline} to make [rather than accept the alliance as
is]{.underline}. Periodically reconsidering the value and legitimacy of
these commitments isn't unreasonable. In fact, it's one marker of a
healthy relationship.

#### The addition of Sweden and Finland [improves]{.underline} burden sharing, [bolsters]{.underline} deterrence of Russia, and is makes the Asia pivot tenable.

Membership of [Finland and Sweden]{.underline} in NATO reinforces each
of these imperatives. Both [are members of America's largest **trade**
and **investment** partner, the EU.]{.underline} Sweden has the
ninth-largest economy in the 27-member EU, Finland the 15th. [Both are
home to advanced **manufacturing** and vibrant **tech startup**
communities]{.underline}

[Finland and Sweden are among the world's most **robust
democracies**]{.underline}. The [greatest threat to **freedom** in
Europe today is Russia, which has **invaded** neighboring democracies
like Ukraine and Georgia and made efforts to **undermine** democracy
across the Continent]{.underline}. Given their proximity to this threat,
Finland and Sweden clearly understand this.

Their perspectives are especially important as the alliance is revising
its strategy and debating whether and how to privilege collective
defense relative to its other two core tasks---cooperative security and
crisis management. It's also important given debates over where NATO
should focus its efforts between the multi-faceted Russian threat on the
one hand and the challenges posed by terrorists and nonstate actors on
the other. [**Finnish** and **Swedish** membership in the alliance
should **strengthen** NATO's determination to **prioritize** the
**Russian threat**. This will likely be welcomed by Washington, given
its focus on strategic competition with Russia (and China).]{.underline}

[When it comes to **burden-sharing**, Finland and Sweden have already
**proved** themselves up to the task.]{.underline} If they join the
alliance, it will mark the first time since Spain's 1986 accession that
NATO will expand to countries that likely will be net contributors to
security. [Both countries decided to **increase** defense spending
recently, despite the challenges created by the pandemic-induced
recession.]{.underline}

[Both Finland and Sweden have small but **advanced** professional
military forces]{.underline}. Finland has a land-centric military force,
including a national conscription system that can generate a force of
216,000 troops. Sweden's force is somewhat smaller, but it recently
reinstituted national conscription to strengthen its military capacity,
and it plans on expanding Swedish force structure. [Both countries
**contribute** to the U.K.-led Joint Expeditionary Force, a
multinational force capable of conducting a **variety of missions**.
They also both participated in NATO's mission in **Afghanistan**, and
Sweden took part in NATO's mission to protect civilians in
**Libya**.]{.underline}

[Given their **capabilities** and **track record** of participation in
**multinational** military missions, Finnish and Swedish membership in
NATO would likely lead to **improved** trans-Atlantic
**burden-sharing**. This is especially important as the U.S.
**increases** its efforts in the **Indo-Pacific** theater.]{.underline}

[In pushing the case for the US **pivot to Asia**, one of the underlying
catalysts was the **increasing relevance** of Asia to
America.]{.underline} Approximately 28 per cent of American goods and
services are exported to Asia; some 32 per cent of jobs are generated
through these exports and close to 40 Asian states account for 30 per
cent of their exports to the US. USA remains the favored destination for
Asian students and tourists who contribute about US \$70 billion to the
US economy annually. [Strategically, Asian geopolitics is more
complex]{.underline} than Cold War dynamics. [It involves complex
**political** and **economic forums** such as the Association of
Southeast Asian States (**ASEAN**), East Asian Summit (**EAS**), and the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization (**SCO**) on the one hand, and the
Trans-Pacific Partnership (**TPP**), and the Regional Comprehensive
Economic Partnership (**RCEP**) competing for favorable **trade
parameters** on the other]{.underline}. Ideological positions are not as
rigid as witnessed during the Cold War. Consequently, [Asian geopolitics
is not a zero-sum game and is dominated by economic
**interdependencies** and trade **considerations** but is also **glued
together** by a common recognition]{.underline} that whilst economic
rivalries may exist, security threats emanating from terror and
calamities require coordinated and consultative approaches for their
resolution. To that end, the US had to contend with the core issue of
diplomatically containing regional space, nuclear and ballistic missile
programs, the absence of a NATO or Warsaw Pact arrangement in Asia and
the primacy of trade and economics over security and sovereignty
considerations. The [peripheral but important issues of **unsustainable
growth** of Asian economies impacting **climate change**, **water**,
**food**, **natural disasters**, **pandemic diseases** such as the avian
flu, and contesting freedom of US Pivot to Asia navigation in
international waters may promote **regional instability**, and **fierce
nationalism**.]{.underline}

**[when they need his cooperation]{.underline}** in containing Russian
adventurism. Ornery in the best of times[, [Erdogan has
grown]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[even more quarrelsome]{.mark} with the
West]{.underline}** [[as he has become]{.underline} **[politically
vulnerable]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[at home]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
His fortunes are now at their lowest ebb since he first took the reins
in Ankara in 2003. [He and his party have slipped in opinion
polls]{.underline} over the past couple of years[, [as Turkey's economy
has been hammered by]{.mark}]{.underline} a combination of [[the
pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark} and the president's economic policies.
[Although]{.underline} the lira has tanked and [inflation has soared,
Erdogan has stubbornly resisted calls to raise interest
rate]{.underline}s. "Turkey is again stuck in a vicious cycle. High
inflation causes the lira to weaken, which results in even higher
inflation" said Ziad Daoud, chief emerging markets economist at
Bloomberg Economics. "Lifting interest rates would break this cycle, but
that's unlikely to happen." [With [little prospect of]{.mark} an

enemies]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- real and imagined. Some **[of his
[favorite bogeymen are]{.mark} now [out of

[Erdogan]{.underline} to **[[make nice with]{.mark} the Gulf Arab
[states]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[he used to

portray the ruling families of Saudi Arabia]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} the [United Arab Emirates as perfidious
reactionaries]{.underline} **[while pleading with them
for]{.underline}** investment and trade **[deals]{.underline}**.
[Erdogan]{.underline} has also **[softened his rhetoric against
Israel]{.underline}**, thanks in no small part to a friendship he has
struck with President Isaac Herzog. [This [leaves him with one]{.mark}
familiar fall guy[:]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[the

to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[ratchet up his rhetoric]{.mark} [against the

**mendacious and untrustworthy**]{.underline}. He [has lashed out at
another old bugbear]{.underline}, demanding that Greece **[demilitarize
islands in the Aegean Sea]{.underline}**, adding that he was "not
joking." In the months ahead, [expect Erdogan to **build on the general
themes of Western duplicitousness**]{.underline} and to double down on
his conspiracy theory that Turkey's woes are the result of a deliberate
campaign by "global barons of politics and money." [Turks]{.underline}
groaning under the twin burdens of inflation and currency depreciation
[will be encouraged **to blame the US**]{.underline} and the Europe
**[rather than their president.]{.underline}** In addition to using
progressively more astringent rhetoric, [the [president will be **less
cooperative in** ]{.mark}**his dealings [with the
West]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[We're [already seeing]{.mark} [this
in]{.mark}]{.underline}** his refusal to budge on
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** expansion: [By framing his
objection]{.underline} to Sweden and Finland as a matter of national
security (he accuses them of harboring Kurdish terrorists) [[Erdogan is
**exaggerating the threat**]{.underline}]{.mark} as well as [portraying
his recalcitrance as **patriotic resistance** **in the face of foreign
bullying**]{.underline}. [There is [no point in **expecting
reasonableness from any politician**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[who has
their]{.underline} **[back to the
wall]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[,]{.underline}** [and certainly not from
one who has [decided **intransigence is** ]{.mark}**in [his best

President Biden and European leaders, they should recognize where
Erdogan is coming from, and act accordingly. Threats won't work since
they will only play into his narrative of heroic defiance. [Their best
bet might be to signal to him that if Turkey won't join the
consensus]{.underline}, **[they will devise workarounds]{.underline}**.
**[This may [require the NATO powers]{.mark} to [build a

**[[architecture]{.underline}]{.mark}** for Sweden and Finland outside

#### Strengthening partnerships with [non-Turkey]{.underline} members [effectively]{.underline} sidelines Turkey

The recent guilty plea by Former National Security Advisor Michael
Flynn, and the indictment of Trump campaign officials Paul Manafort and
Rick Gates, should highlight the fact that violators of the Foreign
Agents Registration Act have reached the highest levels of government. 1
Flynn's long delay in registering as a foreign agent is particularly
problematic in view of his lobbying efforts on behalf of the Turkish
government. 2 As detailed below, [[Turkey is no longer reliably aligned
with US and NATO interests,]{.mark} despite being a military partner
of]{.underline} the US as well as a member of [NATO]{.underline}.
Indeed, [Turkey now appears to be [more firmly aligned with
Russia]{.mark} than with the US or NATO]{.underline}. Turkey's
penetration into our political system is therefore of significant
concern from the standpoint of national security. This paper will argue
that [Turkey [has become a **threat** to]{.mark} [US and
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} security, and that this fact has not resulted
in the policy shift it merits. Notably, US strategy regarding Turkey is
nowhere to be found within the White House National Security Strategy
document, suggesting that the current Administration is insufficiently
attuned to the risks of our present alliance with Turkey. 3 This paper
will propose several policy adjustments warranted by Turkey's shifting
orientation towards Russian interests. I. Introduction On December 2,
2017, US Secretary of Defense James Mattis told reporters that as the
war against ISIS enters its final stages, US strategy would move towards
holding territory instead of arming Syrian Kurdish fighters.4 This
statement came a week after US President Donald Trump informed Turkish
President Recep Erdoğan in a phone call of "pending adjustments to the
military support provided to our partners on the ground in Syria," a
reference to Kurdish fighters that have been working in tandem with the
US military in Syria.5 This abrupt about-face in American policy, which
includes the recouping of weapons and vehicles from Kurdish militias, is
an imprudent attempt at détente by the Trump administration towards the
Turkish government.6 Erdoğan is a vociferous critic of American support
for the Kurds in Syria. This issue, among others, has strained
US-Turkish relations. For the US, [the di[plomatic crisis with Turkey is
a matter of critical national security]{.mark}]{.underline}, given our
intelligence and military collaboration with Turkish forces. In July
2017, [the Turkish state-run]{.underline} news organization, Anadolu,
[revealed the location of 10 US bases and outposts in northern
Syria]{.underline}.7 In late August 2017, [US troops stationed in
northern Syria came under direct fire from Turkish- backed
forces.]{.underline}8 In December 2017, [Turkey finalized the purchase
of the S-400 surface-to-air missile defense system from Russia, the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's]{.underline} (hereinafter "NATO" or
the "Alliance") historical [adversary]{.underline}.9 [These are but a
few recent examples of increasingly [**overtly hostile acts** taken by
Turkey]{.mark} [against NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}, [actions that suggest a
[growing alliance between Turkey and the Kremlin]{.mark}, and a lack of
commitment to democratic ideals]{.underline}. Erdoğan once revealed his
attitude towards democracy by remarking, "Democracy is like a bus, when
you arrive at your destination, you step off."10 Turkey possesses a
formidable military and a robust economy. NATO's only Muslim-majority
state, Turkey serves as NATO's bridge to the Middle East, sharing as it
does a border with Syria, Iraq, and Iran. Turkey also helps to stem the
tide of migration into Europe. It is in Russia's interest to drive a
wedge between NATO and Turkey, both to diminish NATO and to bring Turkey
increasingly within Russia's sphere of influence. Turkish recalcitrance
towards contributing forces and capacities to NATO operations may
reflect an enhanced Turkish-Russian relationship[. [Strengthening
bilateral relationships **with other NATO nations**]{.underline}]{.mark}
as well as pursuing a multilateral NATO approach towards Turkey, [in a
judicious combination of]{.underline} "[carrots and
sticks]{.underline}," [appears to be [the **optimal path** moving
forward]{.mark} for the US]{.underline}.

#### Absent [exclusion]{.underline}, Turkey spoils "security cooperation"

Foreign and Defense Policy: From "Zero Problems" to "Precious
Loneliness"

The AKP has moved away from the strategy of its first years in power,
which gave priority to European integration, good relations with the
United States, and the leveraging of Turkey's economic strength and
Ottoman heritage to build good relations with all its neighbors---a
policy that was dubbed "zero problems." [[Erdoğan]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[pursuing]{.underline}]{.mark} a realist
[[balancing]{.underline}]{.mark} strategy in foreign affairs, seeking to
leave open options [that]{.underline} will [best [advance his
consolidation of power]{.mark}]{.underline} and Turkish national
interests. [[Erdoğan's]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[provocative
actions]{.underline}]{.mark} and rhetoric [that express]{.underline} his
[disappointment with Europe, the United States, and Israel]{.underline}
have [further **[strained]{.mark} [relations]{.mark}**
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} these [longtime [allies]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Erdoğan]{.mark} is **[more focused]{.mark}** [on]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[building]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[country's stature]{.mark}
in]{.underline} the [Islamic world [and **forging new ties** with Russia
and China]{.mark}]{.underline}. He has not given up on the West but
appears to hope that he can elicit favorable policy changes from allies
and partners by demonstrating that he has options. Up until U.S.
President Donald Trump announced his decision to move the U.S. embassy
in Israel to Jerusalem in December 2017, Turkish officials expressed
hopes that Trump would bring a fresh start in relations with Washington,
and Erdoğan has been using his budding relationship with French
President Emmanuel Macron to bring a reset in relations with the EU.

Turkish leaders have tried to forge wary partnerships with historic
rivals Russia and Iran, particularly as these two gained control over
the end game in the Syrian civil war since 2015. Differences with Iraq,
many Gulf states, and Egypt over the AKP's ties to the Muslim
Brotherhood, policies in the wake of the Arab Spring, and stance on
Qatar have seemed to diminish the stature in the Arab world that Turkey
had around 2010. As policy differences with nearly all its neighbors and
allies have mounted, leaders of the AKP and the MHP have argued that
Turkey must be more self-reliant in protecting its interests and accept
a "precious loneliness" in taking principled stands to defend its values
and national interests. The [AKP's foreign policy]{.underline} continues
to [reflect]{.underline} an [anticolonial nationalism borne
of]{.underline} this [period and]{.underline} a [[suspicion of
**globalization** and **foreign influence**]{.mark}
widespread]{.underline} in all segments of Turkish society. Polls
conducted in November 2017 indicated that more than 84 percent of Turks
overall agree at least somewhat that global economic and political
elites have too much power over Turkey and should be resisted, and 83
percent of respondents stated that they hold unfavorable views of the
Unites States.2 If a viable opposition leader or coalition were to
emerge in Turkey and dislodge Erdoğan and the AKP from power after 2023,
one could expect a more conciliatory approach from Turkey, because the
three leading opposition par- ties in the 2018 elections ran on
platforms calling for revitalizing relations with NATO allies and the
EU. Nevertheless, [[**deep public suspicion** of the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and Europe]{.mark}]{.underline} would
[**[constrain]{.mark}** the [pace and scope of a future
rapprochement]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[**Continuation** of]{.underline} current [trends]{.underline} over the
next five to ten years likely [will lead to [Turkish]{.mark}
[**foreign** and **defense**]{.mark} [policies]{.mark}]{.underline} that
are [[contrary]{.underline}]{.mark}, in varying degrees,
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**interests** of]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} other [NATO]{.mark}
allies]{.underline} and [[that **undermine**]{.mark}]{.underline}
long-standing aspects of [defense and **[security
cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This situation warrants a
fundamental reassessment of U.S. and European strategy toward Turkey,
preparations for disruptive developments in all aspects of relations,
and initiatives that could maintain cooperation on abiding mutual
interests over the next decade and help restore long-standing ties if
these trends are reversed.

#### Ex ante exclusion is the only solvent approach. Turkey spoils all NATO business.

The warships were escorting a vessel suspected of smuggling weapons into
Libya, violating a United Nations arms embargo. Challenged by a French
naval frigate, the warships went to battle alert. Outnumbered and
outgunned, the French frigate withdrew.

But this mid-June naval showdown in the Mediterranean was not a
confrontation of enemies. The [**antagonists** were France and
**Turkey**, fellow members of NATO, **sworn** to **protect one
another**.]{.underline}

[A similarly **hostile encounter** between Turkey and]{.underline} a
fellow NATO member happened just two weeks ago, when Turkish warplanes
buzzed an area near [the Greek island of Rhodes after Greek warships
**went on alert** over Turkey's intent to drill for undersea natural gas
there.]{.underline}

[Turkey --- increasingly assertive, **ambitious** and **authoritarian**
--- has become "the **elephant in the room**" for NATO, European
diplomats say]{.underline}. But it is a matter, they say, that few want
to discuss.

A NATO member since 1952, Turkey is too big, powerful and strategically
important --- it is the crossroads of Europe and Asia --- to allow an
open confrontation, alliance officials suggest.

Turkey has dismissed any criticism of its behavior as unjustified. But
some [NATO ambassadors believe that Turkey now represents an **open
challenge** to the group's **democratic values** and its **collective
defense**.]{.underline}

[A more aggressive, **nationalist** and **religious** Turkey is
increasingly **at odds** with its **Western allies** over **Libya**,
**Syria**, **Iraq**, **Russia** and the **energy** resources of the
eastern Mediterranean. Turkey's tilt toward **strongman rule** after 17
years with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the helm also has
**unsettled** other NATO members.]{.underline}

"It's [**getting hard** to describe Turkey as an ally of the
U.S]{.underline}.," said Philip H. Gordon, a foreign policy adviser and
former assistant secretary of state who dealt with Turkey during the
Obama administration.

Despite that, Turkey is getting a kind of free pass, analysts say, its
path having been cleared by a lack of consistent U.S. leadership,
exacerbated by President Trump's contempt for NATO and his clear
admiration for Mr. Erdogan.

"You can't say what U.S. policy on Turkey is, and you can't even see
where Trump is," Mr. Gordon said. "It's a big dilemma for U.S. policy,
where we seem to disagree strategically on nearly every issue."

Those [strategic divides are **proliferating**]{.underline}. They
include [Turkey's support for different armed groups in Syria; its 2019
purchase of a sophisticated Russian antiaircraft system over **fierce
objections** by the United States and other **NATO
members**]{.underline}; its [**violation** of the **arms embargo** in
Libya; its **aggressive drilling** in the eastern
Mediterranean]{.underline}; its [constant **demonization** of
Israel]{.underline}; and its [increasing use of state-sponsored
**disinformation**]{.underline}.

But NATO officials' general meekness in standing up to Turkey has not
helped, analysts say, pointing to the group's secretary-general, Jens
Stoltenberg, whose job is to keep the 30-nation alliance together, but
who is considered excessively tolerant of both American and Turkish
misbehavior.

The last serious discussion of Turkey's policies among NATO ambassadors
was late last year, despite the purchase of the antiaircraft system, the
S-400.

Other countries, like Hungary and Poland, also fall short on the values
scale, argued Nicholas Burns, a former NATO ambassador now at Harvard.
But [**only** Turkey blocks **key alliance business**.]{.underline}

[NATO operates by **consensus**, so **Turkish objections** can **stall**
nearly **any policy**, and its diplomats are both diligent and
knowledgeable, "on top of every ball,"]{.underline} as one NATO official
said. France has also used its effective veto to pursue national
interests, but never to undermine collective defense, NATO ambassadors
say. But [Turkey has **blocked NATO partnerships** for countries it
dislikes, like Israel, Armenia, Egypt and the United Arab
Emirates.]{.underline}

More seriously, [for many months Turkey **blocked** a NATO plan for the
**defense** of Poland and the **Baltic nations**, which all border
Russia. And Turkey wanted NATO to list various armed Kurdish groups,
which have fought for their independence, as **terrorist groups** ---
something that NATO **does not do**.]{.underline}

Some of these same Kurdish groups are also Washington's best allies in
its fight against Islamic State and Al Qaeda in Syria and Iraq.

[A deal was supposedly worked out at the last NATO summit meeting in
December in London, but **Turkey** created **bureaucratic
complications**, and it was only in late June that Turkey relented ---
after **considerable pressure** from official Washington]{.underline},
which has lost patience with Mr. Erdogan and is infuriated by his
insistence on buying the S-400.

Spoilers [[**Trust-deficit** within the Western
camp]{.mark}]{.underline} In the early stages of the Ukraine-Russia war,
NATO praised Turkey's attempts to mediate the conflict and sent messages
of appreciation to President Erdoğan.\[57\] However, the widespread
consensus supporting Ankara started to wane following Turkey's veto of
Sweden and Finland's membership bids for NATO. After a short-lived thaw
in relations, the [[current impasse]{.mark} seems to have
[brought]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**Atlantic Alliance** back into the
cold]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [first round of bilateral meetings held
in an attempt to clear]{.underline} the [air between Turkey
and]{.underline} the [two **Scandinavian countries** were
inconclusive]{.underline}.\[58\] Ankara's outright hostility toward
Sweden and Finland's NATO bids rests on the two Nordic countries'
semi-overt sympathy to exiled exponents of AKP's historical nemesis, the
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), and the Gülen movement.\[59\] Although
Sweden and Finland approved legislations declaring the Kurdish guerrilla
group a terrorist organization, the two countries -- but especially
Sweden -- have historically expressed interest in the Kurdish movement's
political ambitions.\[60\] Stockholm and Helsinki are refusing to
extradite to Ankara those charged with terrorism offences or thought to
be linked to Fethullah Gülen,\[61\] which has led to tensions soaring on
minor issues. The election of a former Iranian Kurdish peshmerga, Amineh
Kakabaveh, as a member of parliament in Sweden, and the media coverage
of a PKK affiliate, Salih Muslim, by Swedish state television channel
SVT, are but two examples.\[62\] Turkey has legitimate security concerns
regarding the military activities linked to the PKK and considers the
separatist group a primary threat to its national security.\[63\] In an
op-ed published by The Economist, President Erdoğan maintained that
Ankara is ready to enter into genuine negotiations on condition that the
Nordic candidate countries are willing "to curb the activities of all
terrorist organizations and extradite the members of these
organizations."\[64\] However, [[Ankara's **steadfast opposition** has
been met with **discontent**]{.mark} rather than solidarity
from]{.underline} its [[NATO]{.mark} [allies]{.mark}]{.underline}, [who
[perceive Turkey's posture as uncooperative]{.mark} [and
**provocative**]{.mark}]{.underline} in a moment of extreme

veto** Sweden and Finland's]{.mark}]{.underline} bid for Nato
membership, the [[stalemate]{.mark} [will]{.mark} likely [**nurture

above dynamics**]{.underline} are not handled deftly, the temporary cold
[could drive a **major wedge** between Turkey and]{.underline} the
[other members of the Atlantic Alliance]{.underline}. Needless to say,
such a fractured Western camp significantly waters down the chance of a
successful Turkey-led mediation.

### S\-\--Cohesion

#### Punishing Turkey causes [other allies]{.underline} to fear being singled-out. Causes buy-in for alliance initiatives.

**Carothers 21**, senior vice president for studies at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace and Benjamin Press, research assistant
in the Democracy, Conflict, and Governance Program (Thomas, "Navigating
the Democracy-Security Dilemma in U.S. Foreign Policy: Lessons from
Egypt, India, and Turkey," *Carnegie Endowment for International Peace*,
<https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/11/04/navigating-democracy-security-dilemma-in-u.s.-foreign-policy-lessons-from-egypt-india-and-turkey-pub-85701>)//BB

In addition, [[policymakers should not limit]{.mark} their
[expectations]{.mark} for positive change [only to potential
liberalizing actions by the partner
government]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} They should also ask whether
greater attention from the United States on democracy issues helps
bolster the will and steadfastness of embattled leaders in civil society
or the political opposition of the country in question. A common mistake
is to think of the push on democracy and rights issues with a
problematic security partner only in terms of effects on the government.
But other parts of the political and civic communities are highly
important and reactive to external signals. However, U.S. policymakers
need to be careful of crossing the line between support and perceived
(or real) interference in a foreign country's domestic politics. For
example, pushing the government hard on maintaining electoral integrity
may be more effective than expressing direct support for opposition
forces. [U.S. officials should also evaluate the [regional and global
signaling effects of]{.mark} stepping [engagement]{.mark} up [on
democracy]{.mark} [with a particular
country]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[Speaking out on]{.mark}
democracy [challenges in India]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, [may
[have]{.mark} [positive]{.mark} signaling [effects]{.mark} [on other
countries in South Asia]{.mark}]{.underline} given India' s heft in the
region; [so, too, may **[raising these issues with Turkey]{.mark}
[signal what is in store if other NATO allies]{.mark}**, [like **Hungary
and Poland**]{.mark}**, [continue]{.mark} down the path of democratic
[backsliding]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [There are often wider benefits to
engaging on democracy and human rights, so policymakers should avoid the
tendency to think of responses to the democracy-security dilemma in a
particular country as relating **only to that country**]{.underline}.

#### Making the US support seem [somewhat conditional]{.underline} paradoxically improves allied buy-in

**Gannon** and Kent **21**, PhD in Political Science @ UC-San Diego,
\*\*PhD in Political Science @ Ohio State ("Keeping Your Friends Close,
but Acquaintances Closer: Why Weakly Allied States Make Committed
Coalition Partners," *Journal of Conflict Resolution*, 65.5)//BB

[Because alliance membership is a club good, not a pure public good,
**worries about being excluded** from the security benefits of an
alliance can incentivize a state to try to **shore up the alliance** by
sending a]{.underline} costly [signal of their commitment to their
alliance partners]{.underline}. "[Today, we should expect the European
allies to]{.underline} find that the best way to
**[strengthen]{.underline}** (or avoid weakening) **[their bonds with
the United States]{.underline}** is to contribute to out-of-area
operations like ISAF. According to this line of reasoning, the allies
who put the highest premium on NATO's traditional products should be the
ones---together with the United States---shouldering the heaviest
burdens in Afghanistan" (Ringsmose 2010, 331). Yet the Afghanistan case
demonstrates [this is not just a story about club goods in formal
alliances, but **security cooperation more generally**]{.underline}.
[States may]{.underline} use war efforts as a [signal of their
willingness to accept large costs in the hopes that this will **improve
their relationship with the coalition leader** in the
future]{.underline}. States use conflicts that are not of immediate
strategic importance to--- hopefully---gain the attention and respect of
important international players. [Closer alignments may be valued
inherently, for unspecified reasons, or to help the state acquire side
payments or **policy concessions on unrelated issues**]{.underline}.
Henke (2019a) argues that **[states]{.underline}**
**[contribute]{.underline}** to coalition conflicts **[when the "pivotal
state"]{.underline}**--- **[what we call the coalition
leader]{.underline}**---**[provides]{.underline}** side **[payments as
incentives to contribute]{.underline}**. This highlights our broader
logic about variation in club goods and public goods in alliances and
coalitions. States contribute to coalition warfare when there are
benefits to contributing troops that fall outside the traditionally
understood alliance mandates or security concerns. In US-led conflicts
since the Korean War, Henke (2019a) find that future benefits offered by
pivotal states can induce coalition participation. We extend upon this
finding by arguing that **[states]{.underline}** with unrealized
alliance potential are most likely to be moved by that logic.
Furthermore, they **[will go above and beyond]{.underline}** in their
coalition participation [to try to secure future
benefits]{.underline}--- **[whether side payments or unrelated
payments]{.underline}**---[that extend from a **closer relationship**
with the coalition leader]{.underline}.

### S\-\--Russian Espionage

#### Including Turkey means Russia [gets full access]{.underline} to every element of the plan

The cooperation between the two countries appears paradoxical only if
their relationship is viewed against the backdrop of their past rivalry,
and trust is thought necessary to sustainable relations. [Turkey and
Russia's ability to cooperate without a relationship of trust suggests
that the trust factor is **overestimated**]{.underline}. According to
Russian foreign policy expert Timofei Bordachev, Moscow's military
superiority enables it to regard Ankara as something like a "good
enemy". Nevertheless, [both sides also have other good reasons to
persist in ignoring their history of animosity.]{.underline}

Since relations were normalized in 2016, [**too much** has been at stake
for either side to jeopardize the **cooperation**. In Syria, Moscow and
Ankara are dependent on each other for preserving vital
interests]{.underline}: in Russia's case, preventing regime change and
in Turkey's, containing the Kurdish push for autonomy. On a bilateral
level [their mutual **dependence** is **maintained** through **strategic
projects** like Akkuyu, TurkStream and S-400.]{.underline} An important
aspect of TurkishRussian relations since the 2016 normalization is thus
their expansion into areas with structural components. "No longer do
construction, tourism, textiles, and fruit or vegetables define
Turkish-Russian economic ties," says Galip Dalay. "Instead, [cooperation
has shifted to **strategic industries** that create **long-lasting**
mutual dependencies]{.underline}".

When examining Turkish-Russian relations, then, we should focus not on
the form, but on the substance of their interdependence. This has two
implications for the West. First, personal relations between the Turkish
and Russian presidents should not be overestimated. Western political
circles should be prepared for the possibility of continuity in the
respective foreign policies of Ankara and Moscow beyond the incumbent
presidents' terms of office. A change of leadership need not mean a
change in foreign policy, either in Turkey or in Russia.

Secondly, the nature of the current Turkish-Russian partnership should
not be underestimated. [The relationship is often dismissed as purely
transactional, but in fact it is precisely this **transactional aspect**
that must be taken **seriously**]{.underline}: [the transactional
dynamics of the partnership, defined as an interested **negotiation
process** aimed at **mutually beneficial** interaction, allow Turkey and
Russia not only to **upgrade** their **bilateral
relations**]{.underline}, [but to enter into]{.underline} a regional
[**coop**eration that is **unparalleled**]{.underline} in the history of
the countries' relationship.

Although a major component of Turkish-Russian interaction, the Astana
format alone does not make the partnership in Syria unique. [The most
important aspect of Turkish-Russian cooperation in Syria is the **strong
bond** resulting from their mutual involvement; it allows both Ankara
and Moscow to **combat** what they **perceive** as existential threats
to their countries.]{.underline} In this way, the potential for
confrontation or cooperation inherent in the Syrian conflicts has
nothing to do with the countries' past rivalry, and everything to do
with their current priorities. Similarly, [it **doesn't matter** what
side of the conflict Russia and Turkey are on; what counts are their
**motives**.]{.underline}

[This **extraordinary interdependence**, meanwhile, increases the
likelihood that Ankara and Moscow will]{.underline} go on to
[**cooperate** in]{.underline} other regional [**conflicts** in which
they are on opposing sides]{.underline}. If we compare the level of
Turkish-Russian cooperation before and after the Syrian conflict, we
find that not only have [**bilateral relations** considerably
**improved**, but there is a significant difference in the "**export**"
of their **regional interaction**. Turkey and Russia recently
**expanded** their regional agenda]{.underline} for the next two years.
[It now reaches well beyond Nagorno-Karabakh, Syria and Libya to take in
the Balkans, the eastern Mediterranean including Cyprus, and the Black
Sea including Ukraine]{.underline}. This new expanded agenda contrasts
starkly with the pre-crisis agenda of 2015 when there was a much lower
level of cooperation. In 2010, for example, Moscow offered Turkey the
chance to cooperate with Russia in the Middle East. At that time the
Turkish leadership's shared regional agenda was limited to the Caucasus
and the Balkans, because it believed it could operate better in the
Middle East without Russia. These regional dynamics in Turkish-Russian
relations show once again that first, the relationship between Ankara
and Moscow is not shaped by ancient rivalry‚ but by the question how and
to what extent they respect each other's interests. And secondly, [there
is a **reciprocal effect** between the level of their bilateral
relations and their ability and **readiness** to **consult** on regional
challenges]{.underline}.

#### Turkey leaks anything important to Russia

**GM 19** (Geopolitical Monitor, "Point Counterpoint: Turkey Should Be
Expelled from NATO,"
https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/point-counterpoint-turkey-should-be-expelled-from-nato/)//BB

Lastly, [Turkey has been flirting with Russia -- which remains NATO's
main security concern]{.underline} -- to the point of buying its S-400
air-defense system. [This represents a major break from the Alliance and
raises a myriad of operational issues]{.underline} because the platform
is not interoperable with Western hardware. In response, the US has
expelled Turkey from the F-35 program, also due to the risk that by
operating both systems, **[Turkey could leak important information on
NATO]{.underline}** aircraft **[to the Russians]{.underline}**. It is
also possible that Washington will introduce economic sanctions against
Ankara under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.

has the second largest armed forces in the organization.94
[[Dismissing]{.mark} thousands of officers, pilots, and other critical

for NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially because they are being
replaced with individuals with far less experience. [NATO's top
commander]{.underline} in Europe, Joseph Scaparrotti, [underscored this
point when he spoke of the Turkish military's
"degradation]{.underline}."95 Scaparrotti stated: "Those are ones that
have spent a career now and have a great deal of experience... I think
it will take some time for them to overcome that."96 One exiled officer
echoed Scaparrotti's sentiment when he told CNN: "To be very blunt over
here, ([**[the]{.underline}**) **[Turkish

### AT Unanimity Key

#### Including Turkey means [other actors]{.underline} bow-out of NATO initiatives

As tensions grow, [a **key risk** for NATO relates to the crisis'
potential to hamper its **cohesion** and ability to **act decisively**,
as the alliance relies on the principle of **consensus** to
**successfully operate**]{.underline}. Every major NATO decision
embodies the collective will of all allies and results, therefore, from
a complex but fragile process of negotiation wherein nations are invited
to compromise on matters of mutual interest. The inevitable drawback to
this is that every ally possesses a de facto right to veto any NATO
issue if its demands are not met, which they may be incentivized to use
as leverage to pursue national interests. The same can be said of the
European Union, which operates on unanimity and where Cyprus recently
made headlines for blocking sanctions on Belarusian President Alexander
Lukashenko's regime, insisting on the imposition of E.U. measures on
Turkey for its energy exploration in Mediterranean waters. The European
Union was criticized for failing to agree on timely sanctions.

Unlike the European Union, NATO consultations are held behind closed
doors, and disagreements largely avoid public scrutiny. In principle,
however, [any nation's objections could stall **key alliance** policy or
**business**.]{.underline} Last year, leaks revealed that [Turkey had
threatened on the eve of a NATO summit to **block** a key **defense
plan** to protect the **Baltic states** and Poland against **Russian
aggression** unless NATO backed its own recognition of the Kurdish
People's Protection Units militia as terrorists]{.underline}. Likewise,
for years, Turkey had vetoed NATO cooperation with neutral Austria under
its partnership program in response to Vienna's calls for the European
Union to halt membership talks with Ankara. Though in both cases deals
were eventually reached to break the deadlock, and though such
negotiation tactics are not uncommon, [these incidents highlight a
**mounting climate** of **uncooperativeness** and **unwillingness** to
compromise between allies, making interaction **increasingly
difficult**.]{.underline}

[As Ankara grows more defiant, NATO members are indeed finding it
**difficult** to **reign in** their southeastern ally]{.underline}. With
the 2011 Arab Spring and its aftermath, the rapid deterioration of
Turkey's regional and domestic security environments has coincided with
a growing perception that its Western allies are not giving enough
credence to its core security interests. The [stalled European Union
membership project, together with America's disengagement from the
Middle East, support for the Kurdish]{.underline} People's Protection
Units militia, [and]{.underline} persistent [refusal to
extradite]{.underline} cleric Fethullah [Gülen]{.underline}, the
presumed mastermind of the failed 2016 coup attempt, [have all
contributed to **strengthening** the conviction that Turkish security
interests are likely **best served** through **autonomous
action**]{.underline} [--- and not by relying on a **suspicious** and
divided West.]{.underline} This impression is reinforced by Europe's
vocal criticism of Erdoğan's concentration of executive power, and by
the country's worsening economic and social woes.

Overall, [these factors have eroded **NATO's credibility** and influence
over Ankara]{.underline}, just as the latter has become more conscious
of its own considerable leverage over Europe due to its key role in
Syria, which NATO sees as the defense of its southern frontier, and in
easing the pressure to accommodate large arrivals of refugees on
European shores. [The former is linked to **Turkey's vetoing** of NATO's
defense plan for Poland and the Baltics]{.underline}, which aimed at
compelling NATO to provide greater support in Turkey's defense of the
alliance's southern flank --- something Ankara has demanded for years.
Likewise, Turkey's handling of its four million-strong refugee
population, the largest in the world, has contributed to Ankara's
influence over Brussels through its instrumentalization of fears that it
would "open the gates" to Europe for migrants and refugees, which
Erdoğan announced earlier this year in violation of a 2016 E.U.-Turkish
agreement. Given its shrewd sense that the tables have turned, [Ankara
**has lost many incentives to cooperate**.]{.underline} Of course, one
key risk is that Turkey's bold strategy backfires and leads to a fresh
round of retaliatory measures such as collective sanctions or cutbacks
in E.U. funds, with damaging effects on Turkey's weakening economy.

[For NATO, another **conceivable consequence** lays in the
**reinforcement** of calls for greater European "**strategic autonomy**"
in the realms of defense and security, with potentially **harmful
repercussions** on the future of the transatlantic
community.]{.underline} Against a backdrop of deteriorating
Euro-Atlantic relations, [**several leaders** have begun to publicly
**question** the **relevance** and **effectiveness of NATO** as an
organization]{.underline}. A staunch advocate of the "strategic
autonomy" concept, [Macron reacted]{.underline} to the clash
[with]{.underline} Turkey over the arms embargo on Libya by reiterating
his [assertion that NATO was "**brain dead**" for being **unable** to
temper Turkish adventurism]{.underline}. In a recent interview,
[Armenian President]{.underline} Armen Sarkissian echoed these remarks
by [putting at stake **NATO's credibility** over the organization's
seeming **inability** to influence its member's involvement in the
Caucasus. Were NATO to become **increasingly**]{.underline}
paralyzed\[**[limited]{.underline}**\] [by souring internal relations,
**doubts** about the **effectiveness** and **reliability** of the
organization could **further incentivize** E.U. countries into **acting
beyond** the NATO framework]{.underline}. Regrettably, this could result
in accelerating E.U. states' ostracizing of Ankara, while persuading
some allies into seeking additional bilateral arrangements as more
reliable forms of security guarantees.

#### France will [leave NATO]{.underline} if Turkey is appeased

French President Emmanuel [[Macron]{.underline}]{.mark} created a stir
last November when he [[said]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[NATO]{.mark} is
[experiencing]{.mark} a]{.underline} "**[[brain
death]{.underline}]{.mark}**." This single comment created a flurry of
reactions as Member States attempted to justify the existence of NATO.
Macron's comments [must be taken seriously]{.underline} when we consider
that [France]{.underline} in 1959 [withdrew]{.underline} its
[Mediterranean Fleet from NATO command]{.underline} [and]{.underline} in
1966 the French military [left NATO's integrated military
command]{.underline} and demanded all foreign NATO soldiers to leave
France. US Secretary of State Dean Rusk attempted to guilt the highly
independent French President Charles [de Gaulle]{.underline} for his
decision to [kick out foreign soldiers]{.underline} by asking if "the
bodies of American soldiers in France's cemeteries" who died in the two
world wars also had to leave.

It was the Anglo-American hegemony that de Gaulle resisted, and it can
be argued that [Macron]{.underline} is [attempting to **re-[establish
France's independence]{.mark}**]{.underline} after former French
President Nicolas Sarkozy reintegrated France into NATO in 2009. A
[clear indicator]{.underline} that [Macron]{.underline} is [following
in]{.underline} the [steps of de Gaulle]{.underline} is when he
furthered the former president's famous phrase that Europe stretches
"from Lisbon to the Urals" in Russia by saying Europe's territory
stretches all the way to Vladivostok near the Chinese and North Korean
borders.

However, Macron's stinging attacks against NATO did not end with that
single comment from November 2019. Last week [Macron said]{.underline}
that the [[Franco-Turkish naval incident]{.underline}]{.mark} was "one
of [**the most [beautiful]{.mark}** [demonstration]{.mark}s]{.underline}
that [there is a brain death]{.underline}" [of NATO]{.underline}. A
[Turkish warship harassed]{.underline} a [French]{.underline} navy
[vessel]{.underline} participating in a NATO mission, [prompting
France's defence ministry to say]{.underline} that

> "[[this is]{.underline}]{.mark} an [**extremely aggressive**
> act]{.underline} that is [[unacceptable]{.mark} by]{.underline} an
> [ally against a NATO ship]{.underline}. [We consider this]{.underline}
> [an extremely grave]{.underline} matter. [We cannot
> accept]{.underline} that an [ally behaves this way]{.underline}, that
> it does this against a NATO ship, under NATO command, carrying out a
> NATO mission."

[NATO is **certainly**]{.underline} "[brain dead]{.underline}" as it
primarily exists to pressurize Russia despite the collapse of the Soviet
Union nearly three decades ago. To justify its existence, it has gone on
campaigns of aggression by destroying Yugoslavia and Libya, and
supporting reactionary forces like jihadist groups in Syria. It is now
strongly suggested that [[France wants to embark on an **independent
path**]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially [as]{.underline} a **[[lack of
comradery]{.underline}]{.mark}** is [found with[in the
Alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Turkey, leveraging its large military, geostrategic positioning on the
crossroads of Europe and Asia, and controlling the Straits into the
Black Sea, is attempting to balance its relations with NATO and Russia
to pursue its own ambition to dominant the entire region, including the
Eastern Mediterranean. [Moscow]{.underline} wants to [strengthen
relations with Turkey]{.underline} knowing it will antagonize NATO,
while [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} continues to [tolerate
Turkey's]{.underline} unilateral and [aggressive actions]{.underline}.
[NATO's tolerance to Turkish aggression]{.underline} is [so
high]{.underline} that [it is **always [silent]{.mark}** [on Turkey's
**daily violations** of Greek]{.mark} maritime and
[airspace]{.mark}]{.underline}, despite Greece being a fellow NATO
member.

The Turkish aggression against France in the Mediterranean a few weeks
ago was one that could not be ignored. As Greece is not as
geostrategically important to NATO in comparison to Turkey, aggression
against it is always ignored and tolerated by NATO. However, Turkish
aggression against a nuclear power like France was never going to be
sidelined and ignored. Ankara made a blunder thinking that the same
aggression it does against Greece would be tolerated by France.

As [Turkey]{.underline} is [[propping up]{.underline}]{.mark} and
protecting the Muslim Brotherhood Government of National Accords based
in the Libyan capital of [[Tripoli]{.mark} and]{.underline} their
[jihadist allies]{.underline}, [France]{.underline} is
[backing]{.underline} its rival, [the Libyan National Army]{.underline}.
This has been another cause of division between France and Turkey,
prompting [[Macron]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[say]{.underline}]{.mark}
yesterday:

> "I think [this [is a **historic** and **criminal**
> responsibility]{.mark} for]{.underline} someone who claims to be a
> member of [NATO]{.underline}."

He made the comments after holding talks with German Chancellor Angela
Merkel, considered Turkey's closest ally in Europe. He [added that
Turkey's conduct in Libya is]{.underline}
"**[unacceptable]{.underline}** to us" and that Ankara needs to
"urgently clarify" its stance.

[[Macron is not hiding his contempt for]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Turkish]{.mark} government and [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} at all. He
is also the only major Western leader that is open to friendly relations
with Russia. [[France]{.underline}]{.mark} is now [[pushing for
a]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[European Army]{.underline}]{.mark}"
**[[outside of NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[As the Alliance continues
to tolerate Turkey's aggressive actions]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
Mediterranean, [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} could [[push France
further]{.underline}]{.mark} away [[from NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}, an
interesting turn of events considering the past two years there were
endless speculations that it was Turkey being pushed away from NATO over
its acquisition of the Russian S-400 missile defense system.

[[NATO's]{.underline}]{.mark} continued [[appeasement of Turkish
aggression]{.underline}]{.mark} that even [threatens Member States
[could be **the**]{.mark} **very [catalyst that]{.mark} will [see
France]{.mark} once again [leave the Alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Although a Pew survey from February found that only 37% of Greeks were
favorable towards NATO, the second lowest surveyed, the Greek political
elite will continue to be subservient to NATO, counter to Greece's own
interests and defense concerns. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that
Greece would leave NATO. The same survey found that only 49% of French
people were favorable towards NATO, which surely has dropped even
further after Macron's most recent statements and Turkish actions
against the French Navy. Effectively, **[[as NATO continues to appease
Turkish aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}** against even fellow Member
States[**[, the Alliance is only]{.mark}** [**pushing France out** as
Macron sets himself up to be the]{.mark}]{.underline} Charles [[de
Gaulle of the **21st century**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### AT CP Hurts US-Turkey Relations

At this stage, [there is limited room for progress on]{.underline} the
above-mentioned five main [areas of contention in
relations]{.underline}. [[A mutually acceptable formu]{.mark}la on the
S-400 systems is [unlikely to be found]{.mark}]{.underline} anytime
soon, [and this issue is set to become a **long-lasting** irritant in
the relationship]{.underline}. On the Eastern Mediterranean, at best,
the crisis can be refrozen, which means launching bilateral talks
between Turkey and Greece and both sides refraining from sending ships
into contested waters for exploration. Plus, on the Eastern
Mediterranean, we are likely to see more policy coordination between the
U.S. and Europe. The future of Turkey's policy towards the Syrian Kurds
is intimately linked with the future of the ruling coalition in Turkey,
and political developments inside Turkey. [As long as Erdoğan's
coalition with the far-right MHP remains in place, [the prospect for a
policy recalibration is **limited**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[And]{.underline} the [[Biden administration will likely be more vocal
on high-profile, politically-motivated cases]{.mark} such as against the
former co-chairman of the pro-Kurdish]{.underline} Peoples' Democratic
Party ([HDP]{.underline}) Selahattin [Demirtaş]{.underline},
philanthropist Osman Kavala, and novelist Ahmet Altan. Similarly, [the
Halkbank case will continue to cast a shadow over bilateral ties. [All
these feuds will make **crisis a permanent fixtur**]{.mark}**e** of

[In Washington, some still believe Ankara remains a bulwark against
Russian expansionism on NATO's southeastern flank]{.underline}.11 While
areas of fruitful cooperation with Turkey do still exist, this report
demonstrates that [under Erdogan]{.underline}, [Turkey's drift from the
West and tilt toward Russia reflect a [**fundamental transformation** of
Ankara's foreign and security policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Just as
Moscow and Ankara will not soon become stalwart allies, [**[Erdogan's
Turkey is]{.underline}** equally **[unlikely to be a steadfast member of
the Western allianc]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[e]{.underline}**. Rather,
Ankara likely will aim to leverage the two camps against one another.
[[Washington and its transatlantic allies therefore must take **urgent
and coordinated action**]{.mark}]{.underline} to clarify their strategy
[toward Turkey]{.underline}. The West should pursue cooperation with
Turkey where interests align, such as countering Russia in the Black Sea
region and promoting alternatives to Russian energy supplies. But [the
West should also seek to contain challenges from Turkey by **[imposing
firm consequences]{.mark}** for further aligning with Russia or
otherwise undermining NATO]{.underline}, while providing incentives if
Ankara does the right thing.

Why it matters: Critics have accused Turkish President Recep Tayyip
[[Erdoğan]{.underline}]{.mark} of [[employing]{.underline}]{.mark} a
\"**[[hostage-taking]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" tactic [also practiced by
Hungary]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} for weeks has been
[singlehandedly blocking]{.underline} the [European]{.underline} Union
[from imposing]{.underline} an [embargo on Russian oil]{.underline}.

The [**outsized [influence]{.mark}** [of single]{.mark}-member
[states]{.mark} in]{.underline} the EU and [NATO]{.underline} has drawn
increased scrutiny in recent years, especially as both Hungary and
Turkey have drifted toward authoritarianism and strengthened their ties
with Russia.

Their resistance to two critical Western priorities risks
[[undermin]{.mark}ing the **[united front]{.mark}**]{.underline} that
[leaders]{.underline} like President Biden [have **touted** as key to
**effectively responding**]{.underline} to Russia\'s invasion of
Ukraine.

Driving the news: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has said
he is \"very confident\" all NATO allies will ultimately approve Sweden
and Finland\'s applications, will meet on Wednesday with Turkish Foreign
Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu.

Çavuşoğlu said Sunday that in exchange for Turkey lifting its
opposition, Sweden and Finland must end their alleged support for
Kurdish groups that Turkey views as terrorists and a top national
security threat.

Turkey is also expected to use its leverage to seek bilateral
concessions from the U.S., including speeding up the potential sale of
F-16 fighter jets.

Between the liens: Özgür Ünlühisarcıklı, director of the German Marshall
Fund\'s office in Ankara, told Axios that Erdoğan \"saw an opportunity
to extract some benefits both for Turkey and for his own political
standing\" ahead of a crucial election next year.

[[Erdoğan]{.mark} believes he\'s]{.underline} \"more or less [free to
[do **whatever he wants**]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Ünlühisarcıklı said.

He argued it\'s [[hard to stand up]{.mark} to Erdogan on this
issue]{.underline}, [[given]{.underline}]{.mark} the [high
stakes]{.underline} of Sweden and Finland\'s NATO applications, [and the
**unique [role]{.mark}** [Turkey is playing]{.mark}]{.underline} in
Ukraine as both a mediator in peace talks and supplier of highly
effective drones.

Critics, meanwhile, say the [[stunt]{.underline}]{.mark} could
[[set]{.mark} a **[precedent]{.mark}**]{.underline} for [[other NATO
leaders]{.mark} to **essentially [seek]{.mark}** [bribes in]{.mark}
moments of [crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} --- with some going as far as to
call Turkey a \"Trojan horse\" within the Western alliance.

Headnote 13

Special counsel do not perform \"**[the duties]{.underline}**\" of any
office. [[The use of the definite article]{.underline}]{.mark} preceding
both \"duties\" and \"office\" in the definition in the Dictionary Act,
1 U.S.C.S. § 1, [restricts the court\'s interpretation of that
language]{.underline}. The word \"the\" frequently (but not always)
indicates a particular thing. It can also be used to refer to something
generically, as may be the case with \"the office.\" By way of example,
officers include any person authorized by law to perform the duties of
the office in question\--which could be the (Ohio) Office of Attorney
General or some other public office. However, [the word \"the\" that
precedes \"duties\" [has only **one** sensible
construction]{.mark}]{.underline}\--that [it refers to]{.underline} a

1\. **[It Depends On What the Word \"The\" Means]{.underline}**

[The]{.underline} first [skirmish involves the word
\"the.\"]{.underline} The claim language states \"circuitry for
recycling the magnetizing energy stored in said transformer to reset
it.\" (Emphasis added). [Lambda asserts that the word \"the\" means
**all**]{.underline} of the magnetizing energy in the transformer.
[Vicor contends]{.underline} that the claim allows for the possibility
that some of the energy may be recycled \[\*\*10\] to reset the core
while other energy is delivered to the load. In other words, it argues
that [the word \"the\" can mean \"**some**]{.underline} of the,\" and
explains that the word \"the\" was used to distinguish \"the
magnetizing\" energy from the more general term \"energy\" that is used
earlier in the preamble. **[Nice linguistic jousting]{.underline}**, but
the use of the word \"magnetizing\" alone would have been an adequate
adjective to single out the kind of energy intended for recycling. [[If
only **some**]{.underline}]{.mark} of the transformer\'s energy
[[needed]{.underline}]{.mark} to be recycled, [[the word \"the\" would
not have been used]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Lambda\'s argument that the word \"[the\" connotes
**all**]{.mark}]{.underline} the magnetizing energy [is **persuasive**
because it gives [**ordinary** and **common sense**]{.mark} effect to
the word \"the\" in the claim language]{.underline}. See
Merriam-Webster\'s \[\*352\] Collegiate Dictionary 1221 (10th ed. 1993)
(giving one definition of \"**[the]{.underline}**\" as: \"[used as a
function word before a noun . . . to indicate reference to a **group as
a whole**]{.underline}\"). This claim thus describes an invention that
recycles all of the magnetizing energy to reset the transformer core.

#### It denotes the entire group

**Supreme Court of Wisconsin 53** ("De Witte v. Kearney & Trecker
Corp.," No Number in Original, Lexis)//BB

In the instant case [[the words used]{.underline}]{.mark} in the letter
are \"[[the small group of officers]{.mark} of the EIU]{.underline}.\"
The complaint states that for the entire period of time referred to in
the letter, the four plaintiffs were the officers of the EIU. Four
persons would certainly constitute a \"small group\" and the use of [the
word]{.underline} [\"**[the]{.underline}**\" **[denotes the entire
group]{.underline}**]{.mark} or all the officers. The persons who
received the letter are all members of the union of which plaintiffs
were the officers and it may be \[\*\*\*9\] presumed they knew who their
officers were. Under such \[\*138\] circumstances it requires no
innuendo to identify the plaintiffs as constituting the small group of
officers to whom the letter referred. The plaintiffs being definitely
ascertainable as the persons to whom the defamatory statements referred,
the complaint must be held sufficient in stating a cause of action by
each. See annotations under \"Public boards or groups of officers\" in

10 things you need to know about NATO

Collective defence: [The **North Atlantic Treaty
Organization**]{.underline} (NATO) was founded in 1949 and [is a **group
of 30 countries** from Europe and North America that exists to protect
the people and territory of its members]{.underline}. The Alliance is
founded on the principle of collective defence, meaning that if one NATO
Ally is attacked, then all NATO Allies are attacked. For example, when
terrorists attacked the United States on 9/11 2001, all NATO Allies
stood with America as though they had also been attacked.

#### "The NATO" is the whole body, not constituent members

Dr. Loreto **Todd 5**, Professor and Reader in International English at
the University of Leeds & Author of More Than 20 Books on Linguistics &
English Usage, International English Usage, Ed. Hancock and Todd, p.
133\-\--from UM starter packet

[The]{.underline} term [***[collective noun]{.mark}*** refers to a
**singular noun** that has a plural implication (e.g. \[for example,\]
***government***) and [is used when the **whole body (and not the
constituent members)** is being considered]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
category *collective nouns* is not discrete, and it can be argued that
some usages are midway between collective and mass nouns. For example,
*team* is clearly a collective noun and *butter* is clearly a mass noun
but it is not so easy to decide the status of such nouns as: hair linen
royalty.

assistance]{.underline}. Those [are]{.underline}
**[obviously]{.underline}** **[critical foreign policy
debates]{.underline}**, but the authors focus on improving the ability
of U.S. officials to make coherent policy decisions by first creating an
effective management and organizational structure of security
assistance. This will also require major reform to the State
Department's own security assistance programs, which routinely and
without deliberation provide billions in aid to nondemocracies. Security
assistance should not be a diplomatic handout or entitlement; it should
serve U.S. foreign policy and be flexible enough in its administration
to align with U.S. foreign policy objectives and values. That not only
requires consolidating security assistance programs in one place, but
also demands significant reforms to the decision-making structure and
security assistance system at the State Department.

The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations also addressed the matter in
its report on the treaty. Once again, the relevant passage is worth
quoting in full: [The treaty has been criticized]{.underline} in some
quarters [because it contains no provision for expulsion]{.underline} or
the suspension of rights of a recalcitrant member which might fail to
carry out its obligations as a result, for example, of its succumbing to
communism. Given the nature of the pact and the close community of
interests of the signatory states, the committee believes that such a
provision would be both unnecessary and inappropriate. Obviously,
however, **[if a member persistently violates the principles contained
in the pact, the other members will no longer be obligated to assist
that member]{.underline}**. Clearly [it would fail "to safeguard the
freedom]{.underline} \* \* \*" of its people, "[founded on the
principles of democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of law" as set
forth in the preamble, and to strengthen its "free
institutions]{.underline}" as provided in article 2. Presumably [it
would also decline to participate in "mutual aid]{.underline}" (art. 3),
[and]{.underline} might well [violate]{.underline} its undertakings in
[article 8 "not to enter into any international engagement in conflict
with this treaty]{.underline}." [A country suffering such a fate would
be in no position either to carry out its own obligations under the
treaty or to expect assistance from the other parties]{.underline}.(The
Vandenberg Resolution and the North Atlantic Treaty: Hearings, page
379.) "Material Breach" under the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties These passages confirm that [maintaining and furthering the
principles on which the Alliance is based --- democracy, individual
liberty and the rule of law --- forms part of the object and purpose of
the]{.underline} North Atlantic [Treaty]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline}, in turn, **[suggests that a failure to comply with
these principles may amount to a material breach]{.underline}** of the
treaty [within the meaning of Article 60 of the Vienna
Convention]{.underline} on the Law of Treaties. Pursuant to Article 60,
a material breach consists of: (a) a repudiation of the treaty not
sanctioned by the present Convention; or (b) the violation of a
provision essential to the accomplishment of the object or purpose of
the treaty. To constitute a material breach pursuant to sub-paragraph
(a), [the violation of the principles underlying the treaty would have
to be so extensive in scope, so severe and so persistent as to
effectively "disavow" or repudiate the treaty]{.underline} (cf. Namibia
Advisory Opinion, para. 95). Turning to sub-paragraph (b), there can be
little doubt that continued compliance with the values set out in the
preamble and Article 2 is essential for the accomplishment of the object
and purpose of the treaty. Official statements issued by the member
states, including at the Brussels Summit in 2018 and more recently on
the occasion of NATO's 70th Anniversary, repeatedly affirm these
principles. A member nation that violated them in a systematic and
egregious manner would thus cast doubt on the very resolve of the allies
to "unite their efforts for collective defence and for the preservation
of peace and security" (preamble, North Atlantic Treaty). [Should the
conditions for the existence of a material breach be satisfied, NATO's
member states would be entitled, by unanimous agreement, to suspend the
operation of the treaty]{.underline} in whole or in part or [to
terminate it]{.underline} either in their relations with the defaulting
state or among them all (Article 60(2) of the Vienna Convention). For
these purposes, a unanimous decision of the North Atlantic Council,
excluding the defaulting state, would suffice. No further procedural
requirements apply, including those laid down in Article 65 of the
Vienna Convention. Whether or not Turkey is in **[material breach of its
commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty]{.underline}** is therefore
a question to be determined by the other members of the Council. As
Klaus Kress has observed, there is a "very serious possibility that
Operation 'Peace Spring' could constitute a manifest violation of the
prohibition of the use of force." Coupled with President Erdoğan's
threat to "open the gates" for Syrian refugees to migrate to Europe, a
threat fundamentally at odds with the unity and solidarity of the
Alliance, characterizing these developments as a material breach is not
entirely far-fetched. In any event, they [entitle other NATO nations to
**suspend**]{.underline} or scale back [**their military cooperation**
with Turkey, **even without** declaring Turkey to be in material
breach.]{.underline} Although Article 3 of the North Atlantic Treaty
commits the parties to maintain and develop their individual and
collective capacity to resist armed attack, this obligation is meant to
pursue the objectives of the treaty. The duty to develop military
capabilities and to cooperate to this end therefore does not override
the commitment to further the principles of democracy, individual
liberty and the rule of law. [A number of Allies, including France,
Germany and Norway, as well as official NATO partner Finland, are
reported to have suspended the sale of military equipment to
Turkey.]{.underline} Overall, **[the absence of a suspension and
expulsion mechanism in the North Atlantic Treaty does not prevent the
North Atlantic Council from suspending or terminating the membership of
an ally]{.underline}** found to be in material breach of the treaty.
However, with the 70th anniversary of the treaty just past, this is a
sorry position for the Council to be in by any measure. Suspending, let
alone terminating, a nation's membership of NATO would be an extreme
measure to be contemplated only once other attempts to restore unity and
respect for the Alliance's founding principles have been exhausted.

However, [**Erdogan's [Turkey]{.mark} [is in no hurry to see a
strengthened NATO]{.mark}.** Erdogan's Turkey could be closer to Putin's
Russia in spirit than it is to the democratic nations of the Western
world]{.underline}. The affinity between authoritarian leaders and
autocracies should not be underestimated. The [strengthened and
reinvigorated NATO does not seem to be a priority for
Erdogan]{.underline}. [Erdogan\'s preconditions to withdraw Turkey's
veto are not only unrealistic but impossible for the two Nordic
countries to implement.]{.underline} They range from the extradition of
certain Swedish citizens or residents of Kurdish and Turkish origins to
banning their activities in Sweden and terminating Sweden's relations
with the Syrian Kurdish groups. Turkey considers a major force within
the Syrian Democratic Forces --- a top ally in US-led fight against the
Islamic State --- to be a terrorist organization. SDF remains under the
American security umbrella in northern Syria, where they can survive
thanks to the American military presence in the region. Finland and
Sweden would have to change their laws on freedom of demonstration and
freedom of expression to comply with Ankara's demands. This, in turn,
almost amounts to upending Finland and Sweden's democratic governance.
"Mainstream Turkish politicians, as well as many humbler Turks, see the
PKK purely as a security threat and criticize the West for not taking
their concerns about the group seriously,\" the Economist summarized in
a June 16 article, using the acronyms for the outlawed Kurdistan
Workers' Party, which has been fighting the Turkish government for
almost 40 years. \"Turkey equates PKK and the Syrian Kurdish groups. ...
Westerners meanwhile, tend to believe that Turkey bears much of the
blame for the PKK's emergence by refusing to grant the country's Kurds
the rights they demand." **[[Ankara's position]{.mark} has also
[unleashed a debate over Turkey's NATO membership]{.mark}.
"[Turkey]{.mark} is a member of NATO, but under Mr. Erdogan, it [no
longer subscribes to the values that underpin]{.mark} [this]{.mark}
great [alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}**," a Wall Street Journal op-ed
said on May 18. \"[Article 13 of the NATO charter provides a mechanism
for member states to withdraw. Perhaps [it is time to]{.mark} amend
Article 13 to [establish a procedure for the expulsion of a
member]{.mark} nation that meets neither the principled nor the
practical requirements for membership.\"]{.underline} Almost a month
after the WSJ article, [The Economist echoed a similar sentiment,
underscoring the mounting frustration among Western
capitals.]{.underline} "**[[Erdogan's]{.mark} [move to block Sweden's
and Finland']{.mark}s accession to NATO [further damaged Turkey's
standing in the alliance]{.mark},"]{.underline}** the article said.
"[Obstructing Finland's and Sweden's membership while war rages in
Europe is bound to have consequences,]{.underline} even if Erdogan backs
down. ... Western countries will try to work round Turkey's veto by
providing Finland and Sweden with security guarantees. **[[This]{.mark}
may [leave Turkey sidelined]{.mark} within the alliance,]{.underline}**"
it added. Currently, the text of the North Atlantic Treaty doesn\'t
allow member states to expel or suspend another member state under any
circumstances. The 2004 EU summit where Turkey secured a date to start
negotiations with the European bloc is a distant memory. Erdogan's
brinkmanship may not work in Madrid. Even if the Madrid summit ends
without a compromise, Sweden and Finland will likely become NATO members
one way or another. If NATO leaders fail to find a face-saving formula
at the summit, [Erdogan\'s [veto may backfire]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Furthermore, it looks like Madrid would not be a cost-free enterprise
for Turkey regardless of the outcome. **[[It]{.mark} [will be difficult
for NATO to forget]{.mark} the bitter taste that Erdogan left in the
alliance\'s ranks]{.underline}**.

**The counterplan signifies Turkey is [no longer wanted]{.underline} as
a NATO ally. That solves, [even without]{.underline} a treaty-exit
provision**

[[Turkey]{.mark} [has long since abandoned the
West]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its president, Recep Tayyip
[[Erdogan]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[has aligned his country with an
axis]{.mark} [of powers]{.mark} openly [hostile to West]{.mark}ern
interests: [China, Russia]{.mark} and [Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
is his prerogative as a popular, elected leader. But Erdogan also craves
the protection of the West's military partnerships and membership in its
economic associations. He wants Turkey to remain within the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization even as he buys weapons systems that
undermine the alliance's security and hurls insults at heads of member
states. And he seeks "mutual trust" with the European Union even as he
threatens to flood it with millions of migrants. [The [West should
respond by demonstrating]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [its tolerance for
Turkish]{.mark} [truculence]{.mark} [is **at an
end**]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[The [best forum to do so is
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [where [patience]{.mark} for Erdogan [is
already wearing thin]{.mark}.]{.underline} The alliance's first summit
since President Joe Biden's swearing-in takes place next week, and he is
scheduled to meet Erdogan on June 14. Erdogan has deployed especially
bellicose oratory against the U.S. Such hostility was met with amused
tolerance by President Donald Trump, who showed little interest in
American leadership. Now that Biden has said he will resume that
responsibility, he should make it clear to Erdogan that Turkey can't
have it both ways. Biden has had plenty of opportunities to size Erdogan
up over the years, and he has clearly concluded that the Turkish leader
is an autocrat. Turkey, he has said, has "got to understand that we're
not going to continue to play with them the way we have." Turkey is
already testing this assertion by ratcheting up the rhetoric. Interior
Minister Suleyman Soylu has openly accused the U.S. of ordering a failed
2016 coup attempt against Erdogan, and claimed Europe was enthusiastic
in its support. This goes well beyond previous accusations, some aired
by Erdogan himself, that the U.S. had sided with the coup plotters. In
fact, Biden was vice president at the time of the coup attempt, and flew
to Turkey to assure Erdogan of American support. Although Ankara has
conducted exhaustive investigations into the events, and arrested
thousands of people, it has not provided a shred of evidence that the
U.S. or Europe were in any way involved. Yet Erdogan hasn't thought to
correct his minister's charges, much less chastise him. As for NATO,
[Turkey has [brushed aside]{.mark} its repeated [warnings against
acquiring Russian missile-defense systems]{.mark}]{.underline}, and is
in fact proposing to buy even more. [It has ratc[heted up disputes
with]{.mark} alliance members [Greece]{.mark}]{.underline} (over
hydrocarbon exploration) [[and France]{.underline}]{.mark} (over the
Libyan civil war). More recently, [it [used its membership to further
Moscow's agenda by insisting that NATO water down]{.mark} its [criticism
of Belarus]{.mark} for the forced landing of an airliner and seizure of
a dissident on board]{.underline}. [NATO's founding charter doesn't
allow for members to be expelled, but **[Turkey can be
told]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in **various ways**
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[it's no longer wanted]{.mark} as a
member]{.underline}**. A good start would be to reduce the alliance's
footprint on Turkish soil, starting with the withdrawal of nuclear
weapons and other strategic assets. [[The group can]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[coordinate punitive measures]{.mark} against Turkey]{.underline},
**[[including the suspension of arms]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[sales]{.underline}]{.mark}** and economic sanctions. The European
Union should underline the message by confirming it has no intention of
reviving the long-stalled talks over Turkey's accession. **[[Biden could
back NATO with unilateral American measures]{.underline}]{.mark}**. His
administration has already indicated it may extend sanctions on Turkey's
defense industry and will uphold the country's suspension from the F-35
fighter program. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said even tougher
penalties would be considered. This would be welcomed by Congress, where
a bipartisan consensus on punishing Turkey had been frustrated by
Trump's tendency to cut Erdogan ever more slack. The site where
Alexander ran his sword through the Gordian knot is an hour's drive from
modern Ankara. [**Cutting Turkey loose** from the West should be
a]{.underline} more [straightforward undertaking]{.underline}.

Turkey's Incirlik Air Base to launch air attacks against ISIS. To be
sure, [[Erdogan has]{.mark} [been]{.mark} successful in [blackmailing

We ought to do Turkish caudillo Recep Tayyip Erdogan the courtesy of
being frank with him: [A NATO that includes Sweden and Finland but
excludes Turkey is **preferable** to one that includes Turkey but
**excludes** Sweden and Finland. **It is time for Turkey to
go**.]{.underline} As Russian war criminals murder and rape their way
through Ukraine, Russia's long-suffering neighbor, Finland, has finally
decided that it is time to formally join NATO. Sweden, though a larger
and more powerful country (twice as big by population and by GDP), is
following Finland's lead and is ready to sign the North Atlantic Treaty,
as well. [Turkey]{.underline}, the odd man out in NATO, [plans to veto
any move to bring Finland and Sweden into the alliance]{.underline}. At
least, that is the official position. [Erdogan's]{.underline} real
[agenda is]{.underline} something simpler: [blackmail]{.underline}.
Notionally, this is about the presence of a handful of Kurdish militants
in Nordic exile. In reality, this is about the fact that [Turkey under
Erdogan has come to]{.underline} much more closely
[resemble]{.underline} Vladimir [Putin's Russia]{.underline} in its
fundamental political character than it does any of its fellow NATO
members. [Turkey has developed close economic and political relations
with Russia]{.underline}, and [Erdogan has worked hard not to irritate
Putin during the Ukraine war.]{.underline} [Every political axis needs a
third member, and Ankara today fits]{.underline} [more easily between
Moscow and Beijing than it does between Paris and Berlin. NATO
is]{.underline} not only a military alliance. It is also [a community of
liberal-democratic values --- values which Turkey rejects with
increasing vigor and openness.]{.underline} The West once hoped ---
naively, as it turns out --- that [Erdogan]{.underline} would carry the
banners of secularism, democracy, and liberty for the Turkish people,
but he [has led Turkey in the opposite direction: toward Islamist
politics, authoritarianism, and tyranny]{.underline}. [**It is time to
expel Turkey from NATO**.]{.underline} This is a possibility that has
been considered before. Erdogan's brutal suppression of dissent
beginning in 2016 and his cooperation with Moscow in acquiring Russian
air-defense technology both led to calls for NATO to sever ties with
Turkey. Booting Turkey out of NATO will be tricky on both the legal and
political fronts, not least because the North Atlantic Treaty does not
contain an explicit mechanism for expelling a member. The lawyers will
no doubt dice it pretty fine if NATO members argue that Turkey is in
material breach of its treaty obligations, but as a matter of fact
**[Turkey is undermining NATO in the service of Erdogan's domestic
political needs.]{.underline}** [Turkey is advancing the interests of
Moscow and Beijing and making it more difficult for NATO members to
engage in collective self-defense]{.underline}, which is the point of
NATO. And morally, [Turkey does not deserve to be in NATO. NATO's job is
to defend its members against police states, not to provide a snug
harbor in which authoritarianism may be cultivated.]{.underline} NATO's
neighboring bureaucracy in Brussels should also do Erdogan the courtesy
of being frank and formally ending all consideration of Turkey as a
candidate for membership in the European Union. Turkey was not a very
good fit for the European Union at its best, and it is far from at its
best today. Beyond its backsliding into soft dictatorship, Turkey is an
economic basket case with 70 percent inflation and increasingly
irresponsible economic policies. The European Union had a hard enough
time with Greece's financial shenanigans, and Greece is Denmark compared
to Turkey. Geopolitics is not a matter of friendship. As Lord Palmerston
put it (and here the full quotation is more illuminating than the
apocryphal proverb attributed to Charles de Gaulle), "We have no eternal
allies, and we have no perpetual enemies. Our interests are eternal and
perpetual, and those interests it is our duty to follow." There was a
time when it seemed that Turkey was fitted to NATO's permanent
interests. Turkey joined NATO in 1952, when the organization was not yet
a decade old and Joseph Stalin was still extant, if only barely that.
NATO's optimism was perhaps excessive, but, at the time, Turkey
identified itself very strongly with the West and looked westward toward
its future. [Today's Turkey looks eastward]{.underline}, and that fact
should be acknowledged. Things did not have to go this way, but Turkey
has made its choices --- not only the autocratic junta of Recep Tayyip
Erdogan but the Turkish people, too. Perhaps that looks like a tragedy
when seen from Brussels and like something else when seen from Ankara.
But however we feel about them, [the facts on the ground are what they
are, and it is time for NATO to recognize this and act
accordingly]{.underline}.

[Protecting Europe from any further expansion of the Soviet
Union]{.underline}'s sphere of influence and interference was the main
argument for expanding NATO membership, to include Turkey in 1952.
Turkey, in turn, sought to be part of the European club and approached
the West. [That is why the US military presence in Turkey with
conventional and nuclear forces was against the Soviet threat as well as
against the potential effects of instability and conflicts in the Middle
East]{.underline}. Where the strategic interests of the allies always
dominate relations between Turkey and NATO, during and after the Cold
War. That is why Turkey was under the protection of NATO and its supply
of advanced weapons. [Turkey is an important member of NATO because of
its strategic location between East and West]{.underline}, and its
control of the Bosporus and Dardanelles to prevent Russia from reaching
the Mediterranean Sea. [Also hosting the Turkish Incirlik
base]{.underline} for the American forces and the Patriot missiles,
Turkey's contribution to NATO with its soldiers in Kosovo and
Afghanistan and supporting NATO's military and financial tasks. [That is
why Erdogan takes advantage of all this to use him in his despotic
policies and practices that are angering NATO countries and increasing
their division]{.underline}. The preamble to the 1949 NATO Treaty states
that NATO members are "determined to protect the freedom, shared
heritage, and civilization of their people, based on the principles of
democracy, individual freedom, and the rule of law." That is why the
member states of NATO are very concerned about the changes taking place
in Turkey, but nonetheless [NATO seeks to preserve the relationship with
Turkey and not leave the alliance.]{.underline} **[This policy towards
Turkey tarnishes the alliance's image and mission, weakens democracy and
the rule of law, and further weakens the alliance]{.underline}**. [It
contributes to]{.underline} encouraging [Erdogan]{.underline} to
escalate his [influence by supporting extremist Islamic movements, ISIS,
Al-Qaeda and Al-Nusra Movement,]{.underline} and thus the terrorism
industry in the Middle East, and its export to Europe. So, they should
deal Turkey practices as a "frenemy" and adopt the term that has been
applied to Pakistan. As a [result, if NATO remains silent toward
Erdogan's authoritarian policies, which are hostile to liberal and
democratic values, and his cooperation with Iran and Russia, we will
find NATO implicated and responsible for Turkey's crimes,]{.underline}
where [war crimes in]{.underline}side [Syria]{.underline} and [ethnic
cleansing of the Kurds, as well as its interference in
Libya]{.underline}. **[This will send NATO into wars to defend a member
of the alliance. This will bring disaster, instability and the
possibility of Iran and Russia affecting NATO's security and military
affairs through their relations and strategic cooperation with
Turkey.]{.underline}**

Ousting Turkey: The Benefits

These [multiple divergences between Turkey and its Western allies cast
doubt on the validity of Ankara's ongoing membership in
NATO]{.underline}. Despite its official stance, [Ankara has proven
resistant when called to intervene in defense of the Organization's
common interest]{.underline}; however, it has not hesitated to pursue
its own objectives, even when this meant contravening the NATO line.
[Turkey]{.underline} often [behaves like an unreliable and ambivalent
partner, and its participation in the Alliance creates more problems
than benefits]{.underline}:

First, [any attack on Turkish territory would be considered an attack
against all members]{.underline}, which would leave the Alliance facing
the dilemma of either being involved in a war or losing the credibility
of its collective security guarantee. While an attack from Russia is a
calculated risk since NATO mainly exists to deter this scenario, it is
also true that [Turkey's occasional recklessness]{.underline} -- such as
the downing of a Russian military aircraft in 2015 -- **[could lead to
an escalation]{.underline}** with unforeseeable consequences. [Yet
Ankara can pursue its assertive policy **largely because it is part of
the Alliance**]{.underline}, [meaning that it exposes the collectivity
to useless risks for its own benefit]{.underline}. In addition, Russia
is not the only potential antagonist: [any standoff between Turkey and
Iran could produce the same effects.]{.underline} At present, Turkey's
improving relations with both powers would seem to exclude the
possibility, but it cannot be ruled out in the future.

Alliance]{.underline}. Both retain effective militaries focused upon
great-power war; neither would need overwhelming American logistical

U.S., Sweden and Finland can pull their own combat weight. [Hungarian

Hungary a more likely candidate to oppose any NATO expansion. Orban has

[**[Overconfidence]{.mark}** about Controlling Nuclear
Escalation]{.underline}?

In light of their confidence about avoiding nuclear escalation, how much
control do Chinese experts believe that their leaders would have over
escalation in both conventional conflict and from a conventional war to
a nuclear war? Although their views vary, [[Chinese experts]{.mark}
likely **[overstate]{.mark}** the **[ability]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
[China's]{.mark} leaders [to **control escalation**]{.mark}, [even if
nuclear weapons are not used]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[161\] Their
confidence is also an exception to China's generally skeptical views
about nuclear escalation control, because it reflects a belief similar
to that of the Cold War proponents that Chinese and U.S. perceptions of
each other's desire to avoid nuclear war would be robust even once a
conflict began. Chinese experts hold these beliefs not because they
share the views of proponents about controlling nuclear escalation, but
because they underplay the pressures to escalate to a nuclear war that
could result from interactions between the United States and China in a
conventional conflict.

One reason why the amount of control is likely overstated is that
[Chinese experts may [equate the CCP's strict control over the PLA, and
its nuclear forces]{.mark} in particular, [with a]{.mark} corresponding
[ability to **control escalation**]{.mark} once a crisis or conflict
erupted]{.underline}. In addition to the PLA's centralized command
structure, the presence of political commissars, officers who are tasked
with ensuring party decisions are implemented within the PLA, is seen as
strengthening escalation control by ensuring that subordinates comply
with the intent of China's top military decisionmakers on the
CMC.\[162\] More generally, a recent defense policy study guide for
party cadres underscores that China's nuclear missiles and ballistic
missile submarines "are under the direct control of the CMC." Thus, all
command decisions flow from the CMC: ["When the country is under a
nuclear threat, according to the commands of the CMC, \[they will\]
increase **alert status**, make good **preparations** for nuclear
**counterattack**, prevent the enemy from using nuclear weapons against
us; when the country receives a surprise nuclear attack, \[they will\]
use **nuclear missile weapons** to carry out a **resolute**
counterattack against the enemy."]{.underline}\[163\] Given the CMC's
tight control, and how it is discussed, it is more difficult for experts
to imagine accidents and mistakes involving nuclear weapons. In
addition, in some campaigns the CMC may also directly control the
conventional missile force.\[164\] Some PLA texts also suggest that
anti-satellite weapons and strategic cyberattacks would be similarly
strictly controlled.\[165\] Chinese leaders' strict control over
strategic weapons, however, is not the same as strict control over how
an adversary acts in a conflict or how a crisis unfolds.

A second reason why the amount of control exercised by China's national
leaders may be overstated is that [many written sources and some experts
do not consider [how China's actions]{.mark} in a crisis or war [could
be **misperceived** and **increase** the odds of **nuclear escalation**
by **the U**]{.mark}**nited [St]{.mark}ates**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The
2004 Science of Second Artillery Campaigns, for example, suggests arming
an ICBM with a conventional warhead to attack an opponent's homeland as
a way to signal resolve and counter air raids against China. [The goal
would be to "to shock the adversary **psychologically**, and **create
terror** in the strong adversary's population, making the strong
adversary's domestic anti-war sentiment increase
sharply]{.underline}."\[166\] Of course, [such a launch would be
**indistinguishable** from a nuclear attack to the U.S. **early
warning** system, creating **great risks** (however unwanted) of
**nuclear escalation**]{.underline}. Although there are no indications
that China is preparing to use ICBMs in this way, the point is that
[sources like the 2004 Science of Second Artillery Campaigns do not
assess the potential consequences of the actions that they
propose.]{.underline}

A third reason why the amount of control exercised by China's national
leaders may be overstated is that [Chinese sources and experts tend to
assume that conventional escalation can be **controlled** because an
adversary will respond proportionately to China's actions]{.underline}.
An adversary's response can be accurately predicted if its intentions
and interests in the conflict are well understood. [Chinese sources **do
not** generally acknowledge the possibility that an adversary could
respond in a crisis or war with a **disproportionate
counterattack**.]{.underline} For example, the 2017 Science of Military
Strategy argues that long-range warning shots, most likely using
conventional missiles or air strikes, would need to be calibrated to
prevent an adversary overreaction or underreaction. The strike would
require "a small amount of intimidation \[oderniz zhenshe\] to affect a
military or political target that is clear, relatively isolated and easy
to attack, and does not injure the population." As the purpose of the
strike is not war but deterrence, "it is necessary to precisely judge
the situation, strictly control the means and scope of the attack to
prevent the action from escalating and expanding to develop into
war."\[167\] Likewise, the 2004 NDU text Coercive Warfare, authored by
missile force officers, noted that it is necessary to "strictly control
the intensity of deterrence at the precise deterrence opportunity."
[China must be able to select the **correct intensity** of escalation
for the circumstances, but regarding high-intensity actions, "it is
**necessary** to know **when to stop**]{.underline} \[shike erzhi\],
[you do not want to make the situation **expand**]{.underline}."
Optimistically, the book states that if China considers adversary
interests and intentions, "only then can employing a certain level of
escalation be sufficient to affect \[chongdong\] the adversary's
psychology."\[168\]

A fourth reason, also related to misperceptions, concerns China's
nuclear signaling. [In general, Chinese sources indicate that China
would engage in **nuclear signaling** to **prevent** nuclear coercion or
to **deter** an imminent **nuclear strike**]{.underline}.\[169\] [An
adversary, however, might view such **signals** as **preparations** to
**use nuclear weapons** in a crisis or **conflict**. An example is the
"**strategic deterrence**" step of "implementing movements of land-based
and sea-based strategic nuclear weapons" when war is
**imminent**.]{.underline} This action is described in the 2017 Science
of Military Strategy as one way of "adjusting deployments" of different
military capabilities.\[170\] Such [actions could be taken to ensure the
**survivability** of the arsenal, but they could be mistaken as
**preparations** to conduct a **first strike**.]{.underline}\[171\] A
textbook for party cadres on defense policy indicates that "when the
country suffers a nuclear threat, according to the order of the CMC,
\[nuclear missile units and ballistic missile submarine units\] increase
their alert status and prepare for a nuclear counterattack, to stop
\[shezhi\] an enemy from using nuclear weapons against us," which could
involve such signaling. The text states, however, that only "when our
country suffers a nuclear attack, \[will they\] use nuclear weapons to
carry out a resolute counterattack."\[172\] This [distinction between
nuclear signaling and preparations for first use could, however,
**easily be lost** on U.S. decisionmakers who are **skeptical** that
China will adhere to its no-first-use policy in an **actual conflict**.
Chinese experts' confidence in their country's no-first-use policy makes
them **less likely** to recognize the **risks** of nuclear escalation
that could arise from **misperceptions** of intent and **unintended
consequences** of Chinese and U.S. actions]{.underline}.\[173\]

The [erosion of US general **deterrence** in maritime **East Asia** has
attracted significant attention over the last few years]{.underline}. To
a certain extent, the discussion has been more focused on how to bolster
US deterrence posture --typically through changes to the forces deployed
by the US in the area. This approach has generated remarkable insights
into the shortcoming of the US position, but it has at the same time
pushed the question of the mechanisms of deterrence erosion in the
background. This question is, however, important because it clarifies
the limits of what could be achieved by changes along one dimension of
US deterrence posture. In broad terms, this section argues that the
erosion of US general deterrent posture in maritime East Asia can be
explained by three primary mechanisms: an enduring local imbalance of
interest that favors China, a changing balance of power that has eroded
US position in the region and a difficulty in drawing red lines that has
been compounded by China's "circumvention" strategy.

Credibility and the imbalance of interests

[Deterrence threats are **inherently linked** to the ability to make a
credible **commitment**]{.underline}. As explained by Glenn Snyder, the
calculations of a prospective "aggressor" directly depend on

> \(1\) his valuation of his war objectives; (2) the costs which he
> expects to suffer as a result of various possible responses by the
> deterrer; (3) the probability of various responses; and (4) the
> probability of winning the objectives with each possible response.

[A **non-credible** commitment implies that the probability of response
is **negligible** and makes "**aggression**" inherently **more
attractive**.]{.underline}

A debate exists among deterrence theorists about the malleability of
commitments and the degree to which they can be manufactured. In his
seminal works, Thomas Schelling argued that the credibility of one's
commitment could be manipulated by the employment of proper techniques
and strategies. Multiple studies have however shown that, in practice,
credibility depends primarily on the actual interests that the deterrer
seeks to protect. Alexander George and Richard Smoke famously argued
that credible commitments could not be created ex nihilo: "[**effective
deterrence** and effective **signaling** require in the first instance
that the interests of the United States be **sufficiently engaged** by
what is at stake in the area or the country in question]{.underline}."
Subsequent research conducted in the 1980s have largely confirmed this
point: the [deterrer's level of **interest** in the protégé played a
**pivotal role** in the **success** or failure of
**deterrence**]{.underline}.

More recently, researchers have shed new light the importance of
"intrinsic interests" as a constitutive part of the credibility of
deterrent threats. Daryl Press distinguishes between three categories of
interests:

Vital interests are those related to a state's survival. Important
interests is a broad category; it encompasses crises over stakes with
real material value that do not significantly threaten the state's
survival. Concerns, on the other hand, relate to a state's values and
ideals but do not involve significant material stakes.45

All other things being equal, the more vital interests are -i.e. the
more is at stake for the deterrer- the more credible is the deterrent
threat.

Press proposes, however, a problematic definition of vital interests.
While the inclusion of the protection of a state's territorial
integrity, sovereignty and population is uncontroversial, the inclusion
of the objective of "ensuring that no country \[...\] consolidates its
control over the world's major economic regions" overextends the notion
of vital interest and appears at least partly incompatible with the
classic distinction between the interests covered by direct --which are
truly vital- and those covered by extended deterrence --which are not.
This is not to say that preventing the rise of a hegemon in a distant
region will not rank high among the "important interests" of a great
power that already has controls over its own region is secured. But the
emergence of a peer competitor in a distant region simply does not
present the same immediate risk and threat than a direct attack on one's
state.

Reclassifying the "distant hegemony" problem as an important rather than
vital interest highlights an issue with the broad category of "important
interests." "Countries," Press argues, "have a myriad of 'important
interests,'" but this pluralistic nature of "important interests" makes
it difficult to treat them as a homogenous category. Some interests are
bound to be more important than others. The existing literature proposes
two complementary avenues to assess the relative significance of any
given important interest. On the one hand, a deterrer's assessments of a
protégé's importance can be largely determined by the latter's
geographical position, the existence of a formal alliance, the level of
economic ties and the level of arms transfers. On the other hand, the
relative importance of a protégé might result from the interest the
deterrer has, not in the protégé per se, but in the region or subsystem
where deterrence occurs. This translates into the notion of "regional
salience" that represents "the tightness of political, military, and
economic linkages between a major power and a region." Though difficult
to assess directly, regional salience can be typically approximated by
the relative importance of the region in the major power's alliance
portfolio and foreign trade.

When considered through the prism of "intrinsic interests," maritime
East Asia presents the US with a significant problem: a significant
imbalance of interests exists between the US and China, which favors
Beijing and tends to make credible deterrence threats more difficult to
formulate for Washington.

China has vital interests in maritime East Asia. Beijing's enduring
ambiguity on the possible application of the concept of "core interest"
(hexin liyi) beyond the traditional issue of Taiwan, Tibet and Xinjiang,
has generated some debate over the last decade, but there is little
doubt that Beijing considers both the ECS and SCS to be vital interests.
Beijing has repeatedly stated that it has "indisputable sovereign
rights" over the Diaoyu/Senkaku, Paracel and Spratly islands and
adjacent waters and has, quite unsurprisingly, listed the defense of its
sovereignty as one of its "core interest," turning these islands and
waters into de facto "core interests."

From a more perhaps practical perspective, Chinese strategists are
moreover acutely aware of China's vulnerability to threats coming from
the sea. The 2013 edition of Academy of Military Science's The Science
of Military Strategy archetypically argues:

Opposing an enemy invasion from the sea is the foundational strategic
idea behind the establishment of our Party's navy; it is the
fundamental, long-term strategic mission of the People's Liberation Army
Navy. Our political, economic, cultural and communicational centers are
located in coastal provinces. Twelve coastal provinces \[...\]
concentrate 38.5% of the population, 34.3% of the middle-sized and large
cities, 66.1% of \[China's\] GDP.

China's interest in the near seas, or maritime East Asia, follows in
this sense the logic of a buffer, providing China with a modicum of
strategic depth. Toshi Yoshihara and James Holmes have also evoked the
possibility for China to adopt a "bastion strategy" for its sea-based
nuclear deterrent, making the near seas a critical component of China's
nuclear deterrence strategy as a whole.

By contrast, [US interests in maritime East Asia, while undoubtedly
significant, do not meet the threshold for vital interests]{.underline}
described above. To a very large extent, the list of US interests in the
region matches the list of examples offered by Daryl Press to illustrate
the notion of "important interests": "defending allies, protecting trade
partners, protecting the rights of commercial shipping to navigate
through international waters." The 2015 Asia-Pacific Maritime Security
Strategy lists, for instance, three main objectives for the US - "to
safeguard the freedom of the seas; deter conflict and coercion; and
promote adherence to international law and standards" - which almost
perfectly match Press's list of important interests.

Other approaches to the notion of interest also suggest that US
interests in the region are important but not vital. The criterion of
economic dependence that measures the relative importance of a protégé
is difficult to apply in the context of maritime Asia. In narrow terms,
data gathered by the CSIS61 shows that only six percent of US trade
transits through the SCS. Details about US's reliance on ECS trade
routes are less clear, but non-China-bound US trade routes in the area
are essentially limited to South Korea, which accounts for less than 4
percent of US foreign trade.62 The second element that contributes to
the relative importance of the ECS and SCS is the direct involvement of
two US allies as claimants in the disputes -Japan in the ECS and the
Philippines in the SCS. The two alliances have evolved in different
directions over the last decades, with the US-Japan alliance being
considerably reinforced under the tenures of Koizumi and Abe while
US-Philippines relations were put under significant strain under the
tenure of Rodrigo Duterte. It remains that in both cases, the US is
involved in a game of (primarily conventional) extended deterrence,
which, by definition, covers important but not vital interests.

An application of the "regional salience" framework, which focuses on
the relative importance of regional trade and regional alliances in the
deterrer's portfolio,65 suggests a higher level of US interests that are
not sufficient to transform US important interests into vital ones. On
the one hand, East Asia accounted for around one quarter of US trade in
2018. But the fact that this figure includes US-China trade --which
alone accounts for 16% of US trade66- creates an awkward situation where
the relative importance stems from the high level of trade between the
US and the prospective target of US deterrent efforts. On the other
hand, Washington has important alliances in the region as Japan, South
Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand all belong to the list of Major
Non-NATO allies --though relations between Washington and its Southeast
Asian allies came under significant strain over the last decade. As
explained above, however, these alliances create a situation of extended
deterrence, where, by definition, the US is not protecting vital
interests. In fact, Press takes the example of South Korea to illustrate
the distinction between US vital and important interests, arguing:
"South Korea has been an American ally for decades and helps the United
States frequently \[...\]. But South Korean sovereignty is not vital to
America."67 This conclusion applies more generally to US East Asian
allies.

A changing balance of power

[One of the most obvious **requirements** of deterrence is for the
deterrer to possess the **means** to **carry out** its threat should the
deterree decide to **ignore threats** and cross **red
lines**]{.underline}. As argued by Colin Gray: "[even a **credible
determination** to fight might avail little if the quantity and quality
of combat power threatened **falls short** of some **critical
threshold** of effect as seen by the intended deterrees]{.underline}."
One of the critical points repeatedly raised by deterrence theorists has
been that military capabilities relevant to a given deterrence situation
often do not reflect the overall balance of military power between the
two parties. [The **success** of deterrence is tightly linked to the
**credibility** of a threat, and \[n\]ormally, one cannot readily
threaten to use force in retaliation without having **force at hand**.
This means that, to deter, a state **must threaten** not just verbally
but with **specific** and appropriate **military preparations** which
place it in some **position** to **respond**.]{.underline}

What is an "appropriate" --or relevant quantity and quality of-- forces
can however be difficult to identify clearly. In his study of the Cuban
Crisis, Daryl Press considers three relevant balances of power --the
conventional balances in the Caribbean and in Europe, and the nuclear
balance between Washington and Moscow.

The debate about what capabilities should be factored in the "relevant
balance of power" remains in many ways open, but the "local" balance of
military power is most likely to play a predominant role in determining
deterrence calculations. This predominance makes intuitive sense because
"decisionmakers are not interested in abstract measures of national
power," but "ask themselves: Can the adversary do what he threatens to
do and achieve his objectives at a reasonable cost?" In other words, an
aggressor has few reasons to be concerned with capabilities that, for
any number of reasons, cannot be brought to bear in the theater where
the challenge takes place, and a deterrer without the adequate denial
capabilities "onsite" leaves open a window of potential vulnerability
that can be exploited for a rapid victory and changes to the status quo.

The above argument suggests that the most pivotal "capability factor" in
the US-China deterrence equation lies essentially at the local, East
Asian balance of power. For the clearest part of the post-Cold War, [US
ability to **deter** what "**Chinese adventurism**" has been essentially
linked to US **denial capabilities** and the fact that "the United
States enjoyed **dominance** vis-a-vis China in nearly all military
domains]{.underline}." This dominance was essentially linked to
Washington's "command of the commons, i.e. "command of the sea, space
and air," which has provided the US with the ability to project
overwhelming power in the East Asian region and guarantee that any
Chinese attempt to change the status quo through the use of force or
coercion could be rapidly thwarted. The pivotal importance of US command
of the commons appeared perhaps at its clearest in the context of the
1995-6 Taiwan Strait crisis. While Washington's decision to deploy two
carrier groups constituted an unmistakable signal of US commitment to
the security of Taiwan, it also made obvious that Taiwan and the US
could maintain air superiority in a war fought in the Taiwan Strait.75
Put simply, the US dominated the escalation ladder in the Taiwan Strait,
and more broadly in the East Asian region, leaving Beijing with few
attractive options to mount a challenge against Washington's preferred
regional order.

[This situation has been **rapidly changing** over the last **two
decades** or so as Beijing engaged in the fast-paced **modernization**
of its military]{.underline}. The scale of China's military
modernization in the last two decades admittedly suggests that Beijing
is pursuing multiple objectives, but [there is **little doubt** that a
large part of Chinese efforts is **driven** by the desire to **erode**
Washington's capacity to project **military power** in the **East Asian
theater**]{.underline}. A debate has recently emerged about the adequacy
of the "counter-intervention" or Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD)
concepts to depict China's strategy, but as Timothy Heath and Andrew
Erickson rightly point out:

> [\[t\]he actions China's military has taken to **modernize** its
> capabilities **speak volumes**]{.underline}. Open sources reveal
> clearly: [China is **developing**, deploying, doctrinally supporting,
> and **training** to effectively employ many **sophisticated**,
> expensive systems clearly tailored to **counter U.S**.]{.underline}
> intervention.

This strategic ambition is reflected in the particular direction that
the modernization of Chinese military capabilities has taken. China was
the first nation to deploy operational Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles
(ASBMs) designed to target aircraft carriers and possibly other large
moving warships, DF-21D and DF-26,79 and operates 1.000+ km-range YJ-62
and CJ-10 anti-ship missiles. The PLA Air Force (PLAAF) and the PLA
Naval Air Force (PLANAF) deploy today more than 1,200 4th-generation
fighter aircraft, which carry long-range air-to-air (i.e. PL-15) and
anti-ship missiles (YJ-12). China has also devoted considerable effort
to the improvement of its land-based long-range air defense systems,
with the purchase of large numbers of Russian S-300 and S-400 and the
deployment of the HQ-9 air defense systems.82 HQ-9 batteries have been
deployed in the Paracels, and structures built on China's artificial
islands in the Spratlys suggest that one of those SAM systems will be
deployed in this area in the near future.

In parallel, the PLA Navy has dramatically consolidated its sea denial
capabilities in the near seas and beyond. As of 2020, China deploys the
largest fleet of diesel-electric submarines of modern design worldwide
with 42 boats --Kilo, Song, Yuan-- that are or will likely be equipped
or retrofitted with the Russian Klub or China's brand-new YJ-18 ASM.84
China has also progressively replaced its obsolete Han-class SSN by six
Shang. The first pair of Shang was reportedly disappointing in terms of
quietness, but the four Shang-II, launched in the 2010s, are reportedly
on par with US Los Angeles-class SSN in terms of quietness and are
likely to carry YJ-18.85 Surface forces might play a relatively less
central role in an A2/AD campaign, but it still worth noting that China
has built more than 40 major combatants over the last fifteen years, as
well as its sixty Houbei fast missile boats and forty Jiangdao
corvettes, and that all carry a wide array of long-range anti-ship
missiles.

The rapid modernization of China's military forces over the last decades
brings about major changes in the balance of power in maritime East
Asia. At the turn of the millennium, China operated an antiquated force,
with a handful of modern platforms imported from Russia that it often
struggled to operate properly. In any scenario of conflict in maritime
East Asia, US forces benefited from a decisive advantage -as exemplified
for instance by the fact that the PLAAF operated fewer 4th generation
aircraft than two US carriers. Today's PLA Navy, Robert Ross argues,
operates "submarines, surface ships armed with antiship cruise missiles,
and ballistic missiles \[that\] now challenge U.S. access to East Asia's
'internal' seas, including the South China Sea." In the air, the PLA Air
Force might not be able to gain air superiority over the region, but it
can already effectively contest US air superiority, and the balance is
moving fast in China's favor. All other things being equal, [the
relative **rise** of Chinese capabilities **alters** the **equilibrium**
in a way that **erodes** US general **deterrence posture** because it
modifies the cost/benefit calculations of both Washington and Beijing
--in the latter's favor - regarding the alteration or preservation of
the status quo.]{.underline}

While [the United States]{.underline} cannot avoid a stronger China able
to exert significant regional influence, it [can nonetheless secure its
longstanding political, **security**, and **economic interests** in the
region and **avert** the conditions that would most directly threaten
them]{.underline}. Since the late nineteenth century, the United States
has sought to prevent a hostile hegemon from dominating Eurasia, as this
condition would impede commercial interests and potentially expose the
U.S. homeland to military threats.19 Potential domination may come in
novel forms, but the same objective remains worthy today. [The United
States should seek to avert the **hostile domination** of
Asia]{.underline}. We cannot envision the precise form it will take, but
[Xi Jinping is seeking some form of a **sphere of influence** in
Asia]{.underline}. And while a state's domestic regime preferences do
not neatly predict its regional behavior, Xi's affection for a closed
Chinese information environment already has a foreign policy analogue.
Other international governance attempts may have similar features. For
several years, strategists have argued that [the United States **must
oppose** a Chinese regional sphere---a geographic area in which China
exercises **predominate** influence in **military**, diplomatic, or
**economic terms**.]{.underline} Chinese influence in parts of Southeast
or Central Asia, however, is not a prima facie threat to American
interests. Nonetheless, [U.S. strategy must hedge against the
possibility that China's regional aspirations are **fundamentally
irreconcilable** with its own objectives.]{.underline}

[Washington should seek to **prevent** China from establishing a closed
sphere of influence---a bloc that would allow it to **dominate** part or
all of Asia in a manner that **displaces** U.S. political, economic, or
**military power**]{.underline}. [An exclusive zone could leave the
United States **unable** to access **vital markets** and strip it of its
forward defensive position, thereby threatening U.S. **prosperity** and
**national security** and, by extension, **domestic
freedom**]{.underline}. This grave condition would occur if China
co-opted the political, economic, or military independence of other
states, preventing them from making free choices through coercion.
[Closure of the global commons could have similarly **grievous
effects**.]{.underline}

The positive objective of U.S. strategy should therefore be an open
Asia. Openness characterizes both American strategic priorities in the
region as well as the types of interactions the United States should
seek to facilitate in their service. An open Asia is one in which
regional states have political and economic freedom of action and are
able to make independent strategic decisions without being forced into
blocs or camps that could result in their hierarchical dominance. Under
this concept, Asia's commons must also remain open, essential as they
are to international commerce. Openness favors sustained interstate
cooperation, beneficial trade, and the free flow of information across
borders. It also calls for transparent international governance, even
among those states that are not themselves full-fledged democracies.

An openness-based strategy seeks to prevent shuttered economic,
political, and security spheres in Asia by helping regional states
preserve their flexibility and independence and doing the same in the
skies and sea lanes. It rejects the notion that regional states should
"choose" between the United States and China and instead incentivizes
them to eschew great power dominance in favor of agency. At a time when
the CCP seeks a more closed Chinese society, commons, and domestic and
international information space, [the United States should strive to
preserve the region's **dynamism** and **fluidity**]{.underline}. An
openness-based strategy acknowledges that the United States will not
retain strategic primacy in Asia. It also recognizes that Washington
does not require unequivocal regional dominance to prevent China from
establishing a hierarchy of its own.

Securing Openness

Openness in Asia will not be easily obtained. [It will require the
United States to **focus consistently** on Asia as its primary foreign
policy theater, **allocate** substantial **military resources** to the
region, develop a viable island chain defense strategy, improve its
**coordination** against **sub-conventional threats** within U.S.
agencies and with foreign partners, and invest in regional openness
economically, technologically, and domestically]{.underline}. Despite a
relatively more constrained position in Asia, the United States can
secure openness, but its objective is far from guaranteed.

[Regional openness requires a **strong** American **military
presence**]{.underline} but does not demand military primacy. [The
**United States** and its allies must retain **sufficient strength** to
deter China from making a bid that could result in its **hierarchical
dominance** of any part of the region]{.underline}, to defend against it
if it were to mount one, and to keep the global commons open. These
[**defensive requirements**, in turn, mean that the United States
absolutely must **maintain** its treaty alliances and **forward
position** in Asia]{.underline}. Since the early Cold War, Washington
has understood the First Island Chain archipelago to be its defensive
front line, but China's anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) approach makes
the direct defense of allies increasingly tenuous. [If it lacks the
ability to **defend** and deter on behalf of its treaty allies, the
United States will struggle to maintain the regional position that will
allow it to meet its minimum **deterrence requirements**]{.underline}.
Washington currently lacks a strategy for First Island Chain defense. A
counter-A2/AD strategy that relies on land- and sea-based missiles may
be the most feasible approach but will be politically taxing to enact.
Beyond an ally-focused defense strategy, [military openness will be far
easier to obtain if the United States can continue to **strengthen** its
**strategic position** in Southeast Asia. It should buttress
capacity-building efforts]{.underline} with Vietnam, Indonesia, and the
Philippines; [**prioritize** defense **cooperation**]{.underline} with
India; and synchronize similar disparate efforts with Japan and
Australia. Despite modest improvements, it must also increase
significantly its Foreign Military Financing to the region.

### Swinland !\-\--NATO

#### Sweden and Finland provide vital [deterrence]{.underline}, [technological]{.underline}, and [perceptual boosts]{.underline} to NATO.

Erik **Brattberg 22**. Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Atlantic
Council's Europe Center. \"Finland and Sweden Would Make NATO
Stronger.\" National Interest. 4-22-2022.
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/finland-and-sweden-would-make-nato-stronger-201951.
accessed 6-22-2022 //ART

For starters, [Finnish and Swedish NATO **membership** would serve as a
**powerful rejoinder** to Vladimir Putin's unprovoked war in
**Ukraine**]{.underline}. It would underscore what a colossal strategic
mistake the invasion is for Russia by tipping Finland and Sweden over
the edge, thus bringing NATO closer to Russia's own border. While Russia
has repeatedly warned of "military and political consequences" should
the two countries join NATO---including recent threats by Dmitry
Medvedev to deploy nuclear weapons to the area---[their membership would
demonstrate that Russia **cannot** rule by **intimidation** or deny
European nations the right to make sovereign decisions about their own
**security**.]{.underline} This is ultimately what the war in Ukraine is
all about. By [granting them membership, NATO would also signal that its
**open-door** policy remains **vibrant**. For **aspiring countries**
like Ukraine and Georgia]{.underline}---both of whom view Finland and
Sweden as key partners---[this should be **welcome news**.]{.underline}

Second, [NATO **deterrence** and **collective security** efforts in the
**Baltic Sea** region would get a **boost**, reducing the likelihood
that the war in Ukraine would ever **spill over** into NATO
territory.]{.underline} While Finland and Sweden already cooperate
closely with NATO on regional security matters, [becoming full members
of the alliance would **help** NATO **defend** the Baltic states in the
event of an Article V contingency.]{.underline} As NATO is planning
additional steps to enhance the security of its eastern flank at its
upcoming summit in Madrid in June, [Finland and Sweden are
**well-positioned** to make vital **contributions**]{.underline}.
[Stronger Nordic defense cooperation with members Denmark and Norway
would also **benefit** the **wider region**]{.underline}, as would
closer EU-NATO collaboration.

Third, [Finland and Sweden would bring a **unique set** of assets and
**capabilities** to the alliance. Both countries have **advanced
militaries** that are already highly **interoperable** with NATO forces
and have **contributed** to all major NATO operations in recent
years]{.underline}. For its part, [Finland, which can mobilize a
**280,000-strong** force and has committed to a **70 percent** increase
in defense spending, was the first European country to receive the
American-made Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (**JASSM**) and
recently decided to purchase **sixty-four F-35 fighter
jets**]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [Sweden has a highly professional
military and recently **boosted** defense spending]{.underline} with the
goal of reaching the 2 percent defense spending target "as soon as
possible." [Sweden has also]{.underline} beefed up its military
readiness since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, including by
being the first non-NATO country to [purchase the Patriot air defense
system.]{.underline}

Besides military capabilities, [both countries have a long tradition of
implementing a "**total defense**" doctrine that emphasizes **civil
defense** and **resilience** and would bring important **first-hand**
knowledge of countering **hybrid warfare** and **disinformation**
threats to the alliance]{.underline}. Both countries are also
sophisticated technological leaders home to companies such as Nokia and
Ericsson. [Finland and Sweden could help the alliance deepen its
**technological edge** in **artificial intelligence** and **5G**/6G.
Moreover, with geographical **proximity** and a **long history** of
dealing with Russia, Helsinki and Stockholm have a unique **knowledge**
and **understanding** of Russia and the "High North" that would
**benefit** the alliance in supporting Europe's **territorial
defense**]{.underline}.

Finally, [at a time when Western democracy is **under pressure** from
**populists** and **nationalists** at home, the fact that Finland and
Sweden are both solid democracies]{.underline}---ranked among the top
five democracies in the world according to the Economist Intelligence
Unit's Democracy Index---is not insignificant. Their membership [would
help **reinforce** NATO's role as a **political alliance** of
**democracies** with **shared values**, an increasingly urgent priority
as the West **confronts** growing **authoritarian** challenges from
Russia and China.]{.underline}

#### Adding Sweden and Finland would bolster NATOs deterrence to Russian aggression BUT Turkish opposition prevents it.

**Cropsey 22**, founder and president of Yorktown Institute. He served
as a naval officer and as deputy Undersecretary of the Navy (Seth, "The
Turkish Question on NATO: A larger strategic opportunity in the Black
Sea," The Hill,
https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3497038-the-turkish-question-on-nato-a-larger-strategic-opportunity-in-the-black-sea/)//BB

[Swedish and Finnish NATO membership would be a **strategic gain** for
the Atlantic Alliance and the United States, both to **counter** Russian
**aggression** and to ensure a **united front** on Eurasian
policy.]{.underline} However, there is dissent within NATO about whether
Sweden and Finland should be accepted, with Turkish President Recep
Tayyip [Erdogan **opposing** both states' participation in the
alliance.]{.underline}

President Biden must act swiftly, recognize Erdogan's incentives, and
court Turkey properly to strengthen NATO's long-term position. His
response should involve inducements and concessions --- Erdogan
receiving desired Western military technology, and in return giving NATO
warships access to the Black Sea.

Sweden and Finland's NATO bids break with both states' long-standing
foreign policies. Each has retained connections with the Atlantic
Alliance through the Partnership for Peace and peacekeeping deployments;
each deployed forces under International Security Assistance Force
auspices in Afghanistan. Sweden has a relatively independent
defense-industrial base; Finland, by contrast, has increasingly
committed to using NATO technology and is now an F-35 purchaser.
Nevertheless, both are formally neutral between NATO and Russia, a
policy that served them reasonably well throughout the Cold War,
primarily because high-end ground combat would be concentrated in
Germany, not northern Europe or Scandinavia.

The [**Russian invasion** of Ukraine overturned this situation and
**demonstrated** the **Atlantic Alliance's value**. Moreover, the
**geography** of the Russia-NATO military rivalry has **changed**: The
Baltic States' membership in NATO makes a **Russia-NATO** conflict
**likely** to involve **Finland** and **Sweden**, or at least to occur
within their territorial waters.]{.underline}

Both states would benefit the Atlantic Alliance. [Both **retain**
effective **militaries** focused upon **great-power war**; neither would
need overwhelming American logistical support.]{.underline} Unlike
nearly all of NATO's current members apart from the U.S., [Sweden and
Finland can pull their own combat weight.]{.underline}

Hungarian President Viktor Orban's positive disposition towards the
Kremlin made Hungary a more likely candidate to oppose any NATO
expansion. Orban has been restrained, however, focusing instead on
opposing EU sanctions on Russian energy exports. Instead, [it is
**Turkey** that **opposes** Swedish and Finnish NATO
membership.]{.underline}

[A **single country's** opposition can **derail** a NATO
bid]{.underline}. Greece, for example, kept Macedonia out of NATO until
2019 because it deemed the country's name to be an affront to Greek
culture: it only relented when Macedonia added "North" to its name.
Cyprus remains out of NATO primarily because of Turkey's opposition,
based on Turkish-Greek rivalry.

However, [**Turkish opposition** to Swedish and Finnish NATO membership
is neither **strategic** nor **ideological**. It is, instead, a
**diplomatic signal** to the Biden administration.]{.underline}

Erdogan's public reasoning is that Sweden in particular and, by
extension, Finland offer shelter to Gulenists and Kurds, the two great
enemies of the Turkish state. Additionally, Sweden and Finland imposed
an arms embargo on Turkey after its offensive in northeastern Syria in
2019.

Both charges have extremely limited substance. Census data is not
current, but Finland likely has no more than 30,000 Turks and Kurds,
making Erdogan's Gulenist charge unfounded. Sweden has 150,000-plus
Turks and around 85,000 Kurds; however, there is scant evidence of
Swedish Turks or Kurds engaging in activities against the Turkish
government. Swedish attempts to create a European Union-wide arms
embargo against Turkey failed; Turkey's military-industrial complex has
not been hindered by Swedish and Finnish sanctions.

Turkey is employing a "stick" alongside its "carrot" to NATO. After
briefly sitting on the sidelines of the Russo-Ukrainian war, Turkey
closed the Dardanelles to all warships. Its legal procedure includes an
exemption for Russian Black Sea Fleet warships transiting to their
homeport after deployment --- but Russia cannot transfer additional
warships to the Black Sea, thereby capping Russian naval combat power.
Additionally, Turkey has served as a valuable interlocutor between
Ukraine and Russia --- it is virtually the only power Kyiv and Moscow
have trusted to host talks --- and the Turkish military-industrial
complex produced many of the combat drones that Ukraine has used to
extreme effect against Russian forces. Overall, Turkey has sided with
Ukraine and NATO in resisting Russian aggression.

Erdogan, however, surely hopes to extract broader concessions before
coming in from the cold. [Turkey has been at odds with its NATO allies
previously, with its Syria intervention receiving the most
attention.]{.underline} Equally relevant, however, was Turkish
intervention in Libya; by the summer of 2020, a Franco-Russian-Saudi
coalition opposed Turkey and the Tripoli government it backed, creating
serious spillover risks. Although Libya's second civil war legally ended
in October 2020, Libya remains unstable --- and renewed conflict may
resurrect a Franco-Russian partnership against further Turkish
intervention.

Technologically, [Erdogan's desire for foreign policy **independence**
cut off Turkey from high-end **Western** military equipment. Its
purchase of Russian S-400 air-defense missiles led to its **exclusion**
from the U.S.'s F-35 fighter jet program]{.underline} and may jeopardize
its ability to obtain additional F-16s.

A **[strong norther deterrence]{.underline}**

In terms of military strategy, [the **Finnish** and **Swedish**
formations can be **easily integrated** into NATO. The armed forces of
both countries are already NATO-compatible, having participated in
multinational **operations** and **exercises** for
**decades**]{.underline} in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Norway, among
other places.

In the next few years, [the Nordic countries will build up a
**significant fleet** of modern combat aircraft]{.underline}. In total,
Norway, Finland and Denmark will then have about 150 F-35 fighter
aircraft and Sweden a considerable number of JAS 39 Gripen. That is an
impressive air military capability. [With this comes significant
**potential** for cost-effective **cooperation** in **bases**,
**logistics** and **training** and **education**.]{.underline}

Adding Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK as part of the North Sea
cooperation, Northern Europe then has approximately 250 to 300 F-35s
plus the Swedish fighters. [This creates a **comprehensive** and
**robust deterrence** regime in Northern Europe. And it **increases**
NATO\'s ability to **protect** the **transatlantic link** across the
North Atlantic against **Russian disruption** strategies]{.underline}.
The latter is a crucial point to ensure that [**formations** and
**reinforcements** from the US can reach Europe in case of crisis or

<https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/05/19/why-nato-should-swiftly-admit-sweden-and-finland)//BB>

For finland and Sweden to join NATO is a rebuke to the anti-NATO
arguments of Russia's president, Vladimir Putin. Two countries that are
proud of their long history of military non-alignment think the risk of
antagonising their neighbour to the east is outweighed by the security
they will gain. It is the direct result of the invasion of Ukraine,
which Mr Putin ordered ostensibly to forestall nato's expansion.

[Finland and Sweden]{.underline} submitted their applications on May
18th. Despite Turkey's stalling tactics, over Kurdish militants and
possibly American fighter planes, their admission is likely. They [will
bring formidable capabilities in Arctic warfare and, in Finland's case,
the largest artillery force in Europe]{.underline}. [Membership will
more than double the length of NATO's border with Russia. It will also
**make the Baltic states easier to defend**]{.underline}. Mr Putin's
regime has responded by cutting electricity supplies to Finland and
threatening "military-technical" action, whatever that is supposed to
mean. He is not the first Russian leader to object to enlargement. In
the 1990s Boris Yeltsin complained when members of the old Warsaw Pact
applied to join the alliance. Over the years this hardened into the line
of argument cited by Mr Putin as justification for invading Ukraine.
Russia's president says that enlargement breaks an undertaking that
James Baker, then America's secretary of state, gave the Soviet Union in
February 1990. Many Western commentators argued that enlargement was
unwise, because Russia would feel threatened. The West had other ways to
enhance security, such as the Partnership for Peace, which sets out to
strengthen relations between the alliance and non-members. These
arguments do not stand up. Mr Baker was speaking about eastern Germany.
His words were overtaken by the collapse of the Warsaw Pact nearly 18
months later. nato and Russia signed an agreement in 1997 that did not
contain any restriction on new members, though enlargement had been
discussed. The Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland joined almost two
years later. The undertaking that has been violated is Russia's pledge
to Ukraine not to use economic or military coercion, given in 1994 when
it surrendered the nuclear weapons based on its soil. In fact NATO has
every right to expand. Under the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, signed by
the Soviet Union, countries are free to choose their own allies. The
Warsaw Pact suffered grievously under Soviet rule. Why would its
ex-members not seek a haven? For many years Finns and Swedes mostly
opposed joining nato. This shifted after the invasion of Ukraine in
February. Indeed, the right for sovereign countries to determine their
own destinies is one of the many things currently at stake in Ukraine.
But was nato expansion wise? [A spiral of mutual suspicion between
Russia and nato clearly exists, but to blame nato expansion for
triggering it is **scarcely credible**]{.underline}. Mr Putin has
increasingly used nationalism and Orthodox religion to shore up his
rule. He needs enemies abroad to persuade his people that they and their
civilisation are under threat. That is why he seized territory in
Georgia in 2008 and in Ukraine in 2014. Besides, Russia has a long
history as an imperial power. Like most declining empires, it was likely
to resist as its periphery drifted off, regardless of nato expansion.
[Finland and Sweden are both long-term members of the Partnership for
Peace]{.underline}. If one of them were attacked, nato would have no
commitment to intervene. Nor would American and British nuclear weapons
cover them. Their choice to join NATO suggests that the partnership was
not able to cope with Russian aggression. Likewise,
**[denying]{.underline}** central and eastern Europe
[membership]{.underline} of nato [would]{.underline} have
**[create]{.underline}**d [a security vacuum that Russia
may]{.underline} very well have been tempted to [fill]{.underline}.
[Finland and Sweden are right to have concluded that Mr Putin is
dangerous and unpredictable---not because of NATO, but in the way he
governs Russia]{.underline}. **[Their applications should be rapidly
approved]{.underline}**. ■

#### That's the [most likely]{.underline} nuclear risk\-\-- [limiting commitment]{.underline} solves

Most Likely To Begin", July 20^th^,
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-the-baltic-states-are-where-nuclear-war-most-likely-17044>\]

While [[nuc]{.mark}lear weapons could potentially be [use]{.mark}d in
any number of future warfighting scenarios, there are multiple reasons
to suspect that [the **greatest danger** ]{.mark}**exists with regard to
[the]{.mark} three [Baltic s]{.mark}tates**. Here are eight of those
reasons]{.underline}.

First, both [[Washington and Moscow **assign high strategic
significance**]{.mark} to the future disposition of the Baltic
states]{.underline}. [From Moscow\'s perspective, the three states are
located **close to the centers of Russian political and military
power**, and therefore are a potential base for devastating
attacks]{.underline}. For instance, the distance between Lithuania\'s
capital of Vilnius and Moscow is less than 500 miles \-- a short trip
for a supersonic aircraft. [From Washington\'s perspective, failure to
protect the Baltic states from Russian aggression **could lead to the
unraveling of America\'s most important alliance**]{.underline}.

Second, **[[Washington has been]{.mark} very [public about]{.mark} it
[commitment]{.mark} to the Baltic states]{.underline}**. For instance,
[in 2014 President Obama stated during a visit to Estonia that defense
of the three countries\' capitals was \"just as important as the defense
of Berlin and Paris and London]{.underline}.\" That is an extraordinary
assertion considering that the population of metropolitan London (about
8 million) is greater than that of all three Baltic states combined
(about 6 million), and that the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea is so
close to the Russian heartland.

Third, [[there is]{.mark} a [**disconnect** between]{.mark} the
[rhetoric]{.mark} that [Washington applies]{.mark} to Baltic security
[and the]{.mark} tactical [situation]{.mark} that would [likely]{.mark}
obtain [in]{.mark} a future [war. Russia has **massive**]{.mark}
**[local superiority in every form]{.mark} of military force**, and the
topography of the three states presents few obstacles to being quickly
overrun]{.underline}. The RAND Corporation reported earlier this year
that in a series of war games, [Russian forces were always able to
overcome indigenous defenders and reach Baltic capitals **within a few
days**. The forces of other NATO nations had little time to
respond]{.underline}.

[Fourth]{.underline}, for all of its talk about reinforcing NATO at the
recent alliance summit (\"we will defend every ally\" President Obama
said), there is scant evidence the U.S. is willing to make the kind of
commitment of conventional forces needed to blunt a Russian invasion in
the Baltic region. [The proposed placement of NATO-led battalions in
each state totaling about 1,000 soldiers each is widely described as a
\"**tripwire\" defense**, meaning it might **trigger a [bigger alliance
response]{.mark} but [would not]{.mark} be able to [prevent Moscow
from]{.mark} [reaching]{.mark} its military [objectives
quickly]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[Fifth, any [counter-attack]{.mark} by NATO in the Baltics could easily
be [misconstrued by Moscow as]{.mark} a **[threat to]{.mark} its
[core]{.mark} [interests]{.mark}**, in part because some
[strikes]{.mark} against attacking forces would **[occur on Russian
territory]{.mark}**, and in part because [Russia\'s fragile]{.mark}
[recon]{.mark}naissance system [would]{.mark} quickly [be overwhelmed
by]{.mark} the **[fog of war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Anthony Barrett of
the RAND Corporation has recently produced a worrisome analysis
detailing how [an East-West conventional conflict along the Russian
periphery could [escalate to nuc]{.mark}lear-weapon[s]{.mark} use
[through **miscues or misjudgments**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Sixth, [both sides]{.mark} in any such conflict would **have military
[doctrine]{.mark} potentially [justify]{.mark}ing the [use of
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}** to prevent defeat. In the case of
Russia, it has stated repeatedly that it needs non-strategic nuclear
weapons to cope with the superiority of NATO conventional forces, that
**it would use such weapons** in order to protect its core assets and
values, and even that nuclear weapons might **sometimes be useful tools
for de-escalating** a conflict.]{.underline} Successive [U.S.
administrations have stressed that nuclear weapons underpin alliance
commitments]{.underline}.

[Seventh, **both sides have [n]{.mark}on-[s]{.mark}trategic
[n]{.mark}uclear [w]{.mark}eapon[s]{.mark} in theater [ready for quick
us]{.mark}e** if tactical circumstances dictate]{.underline}. For
example, Hans [Kristensen noted the presence of [several]{.mark}
[nuclear]{.mark}-capable military [systems in]{.mark} the Russian
enclave of **[Kaliningrad]{.mark}** located between Lithuania and
Poland]{.underline}. Although the Russians have not disclosed whether
nuclear warheads are also located in the district, [there is little
doubt that hundreds could quickly be deployed to areas around the Baltic
states in an escalating conflict]{.underline}. Nuclear-capable NATO jets
could reach the area within hours.

[Eighth, **[new tech]{.mark}nologies are gradually being incorporated**
into forces on both sides that could [accelerate]{.mark} the [pace and
confusion of]{.mark} a local [conflict]{.mark}. For instance, **[the
F-35]{.mark} fighter** that will replace F-16s in the tactical nuclear
role **[can]{.mark}no[t be tracked by Russia]{.mark}n
radar**]{.underline}. [The **integrated air defenses** that Russia has
deployed in Kaliningrad and elsewhere on its territory could severely
impede NATO use of local air space in support of ground forces, and
Russian **electronic-warfare** capabilities could impede coordination of
ground maneuvers]{.underline}.

[The bottom line is that **all the ingredients are present in the
eastern Baltic area for an East-West conflict escalating to nuclear
weapons use**. [Neither side understands what actions might]{.mark}
provoke [nuclear use]{.mark} by the other, and once war began both sides
would likely have a tenuous grasp of what was happening. The [high
stakes]{.mark} assigned to the outcome of such a conflict [and]{.mark}
the [ready availability of \"non-strategic\"]{.mark} nuclear
[weapons]{.mark} in a context where either side might view their use as
strategic in consequences [is]{.mark} a **[prescription for
catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[This]{.mark} situation [calls for a **reassessment** by
Washington]{.mark}]{.underline}. While losing the Baltic states would
undoubtedly be a blow to NATO, their location makes them of far greater
importance to Russia than America. [It simply **makes no sense to tie
America\'s security to countries of such modest importance** that are
situated in such **unpromising tactical circumstances**]{.underline}. If
the Obama Administration took the threat of nuclear war more seriously,
it would [find a way of **[loosen]{.mark}ing the
[commitments]{.mark}**]{.underline} it has made.

#### [Only]{.underline} U.S.-Russia war causes extinction \-- other nuclear wars [don't]{.underline}.

1.1.1 Nuclear war

The [bombings]{.underline} of Hiroshima and Nagasaki [demonstrated the
**unprecedented** destructive power of nuclear weapons]{.underline}.
However, even [[in]{.mark} an **all-out [nuclear war]{.mark}** [between
the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, despite horrific casualties, neither
country's population is likely to be completely destroyed by
[the]{.underline} direct effects of the blast, fire, and radiation.8 The
[[**aftermath** could]{.mark} be much worse: the
**burning**]{.underline} of flammable materials could [[send]{.mark}
**massive amounts** of [smoke **into the atmosphere**]{.mark}, which
would **absorb sunlight** and [cause]{.mark} sustained **global
[cooling]{.mark}**, severe [**ozone loss**, and
**ag**]{.mark}**ricultural [disruption]{.mark}** [-- a **nuclear
winter**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

According to one model 9, [an]{.underline} all-out [[exchange of **4,000
weapons**]{.underline}]{.mark} 10 [could lead to a drop in]{.underline}
global [temperatures of]{.underline} around [8°C, [making it
**impossible to grow food**]{.mark}]{.underline} for 4 to 5 years. This
could leave some [survivors]{.underline} in parts of Australia and New
Zealand, but they [would be in a **very precarious** situation and [the
**threat of extinction**]{.mark} from other sources [would be
great]{.mark}. An **exchange on [this]{.mark} scale** [is **only
possible** between]{.mark} the US and Russia who have **more than
[90%]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the world's nuclear [weapons]{.mark}, with
stockpiles of]{.underline} around [**4,500 warheads** each]{.underline},
although many are not operationally deployed.11 Some models suggest that
even a small [[regional]{.mark} nuclear [war]{.mark}]{.underline}
involving 100 nuclear weapons would produce a nuclear winter serious
enough to put two billion people at risk of starvation,12 though this
estimate might be pessimistic.13 Wars on this scale [[are **unlikely**
to lead to]{.mark} outright **human [extinction]{.mark}**,
but]{.underline} this does suggest that [conflicts]{.underline} which
are around [an **order of magnitude** larger may]{.underline} be likely
to **[threaten civilisation]{.underline}**. It should be emphasised that
there is very large uncertainty about the effects of a large nuclear war
on global climate. This remains an area where increased academic
research work, including more detailed climate modelling and a better
understanding of how survivors might be able to cope and adapt, would
have high returns.

It is very difficult to precisely estimate the probability of
existential risk from nuclear war over the next century, and existing
attempts leave very large confidence intervals. According to many
experts, the most likely nuclear war at present is between India and
Pakistan.14 However, given the relatively modest size of their arsenals,
[the [risk]{.mark} of human **extinction** [is]{.mark} **plausibly
[greater]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} a [conflict between the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and
**Russia**]{.mark}. Tensions between these countries]{.underline} have
**[increased]{.underline}** in recent years [and it seems unreasonable
to rule out]{.underline} the possibility of [them rising
further]{.underline} in the future.

### Swinland !\-\--Arctic

#### Adding Sweden & Finland bolsters [NATO credibility]{.underline}, [deterrence]{.underline}, and [military capabilities]{.underline}.

Sweden." 4-27-2022.

As for NATO, [the Finnish bid would **certainly** make sense
**militarily**]{.underline}. Although it has a small standing army,
[Finland's **reserve force** is Europe's **largest**; some **900,000**
Finns have military training. The country's **air force** and
**intelligence** services are among the **most advanced** in Europe. If
Sweden joins, its military's **air-defense** and **submarine prowess**
would **bolster** NATO's ability to **counter** hostile **Russian
activity** in]{.underline} the Baltic Sea and the
[**Arctic**.]{.underline}

There would be political benefits as well. It's true that previous
rounds of expansion, particularly to less-developed democracies in
southeastern Europe, have strained the alliance's resources and forced
it to do business with illiberal governments. But [adding Finland and
Sweden, both **prosperous** democracies, would only **bolster** NATO's
**credibility** as a defender of **liberal values**. It would also help
**distribute** the **long-term costs** of maintaining European security,
allowing the U.S. to devote **more attention** to the
**Pacific**]{.underline}. Despite Putin's repeated threats, [**history**
shows that a **larger alliance** provides **greater deterrence** against
Russian aggression in Europe, not less]{.underline}.

#### [Doctrine]{.underline} and [deployments]{.underline} mean Arctic War [goes nuclear]{.underline}.

**Féron, 18**---Postdoctoral Research Associate at Columbia University
School of Law (Henri, "A New Ocean: The Legal Challenges of the Artic
Thaw," 45 Ecology L. Q. 83 (2018), dml)

[The [Arctic is]{.mark} at risk of becoming [a]{.mark} **military
[flashpoint]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The likelihood of military tensions
over control of newly accessible natural resources should not be
overstated, as most Arctic resources are clearly in the EEZs or
continental shelves of this or that Arctic State.270 Yet [[the]{.mark}
Arctic [thaw]{.mark} **inevitably [opens]{.mark}** [new invasion
routes]{.mark}]{.underline} that Arctic States must take into account
when planning their defense---be it through the Arctic Ocean, the Bering
Sea, or the RussoScandinavian borders.271 [Loud calls on all sides
against the militarization of the Arctic have been followed by **quiet
improvements** in Arctic military capabilities, especially by
Russia]{.underline}.272 [The **central concern**]{.underline} here [is
the **deep fracture** between]{.underline} the seven [**Arctic NATO
states** and **Russia**]{.underline}, the geographically largest Arctic
state. [[Russia was **not represented** at]{.mark} **Arctic security
[forums]{.mark}**]{.underline} following the Ukraine crisis,
[[increasing]{.mark} the room for **distrust**, **misunderstanding**,
and **[overreaction]{.mark}** in the Arctic context]{.underline}.273
Indeed, **[[key Russian]{.mark} security
[documents]{.mark}]{.underline}** such as the 2014 Military Doctrine,
the 2015 Maritime Doctrine, and the 2015 National Security Strategy
[[identify **NATO**]{.mark}**'s expanding influence** [as]{.mark} being
among the **[top]{.mark} security [threats]{.mark}** to Russia, [and
highlight]{.mark} the need to **defend Russian [Arctic
interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}.274 Security tensions are already
having economic implications, as anti-Russia sanctions in the wake of
the Ukraine crisis have blocked a number of Russian Arctic resource
development projects by preventing U.S. and EU companies from
contributing equipment, technology, and financing.275

These outcomes appear to have been wholly preventable---a product of
mutual fear rather than necessity. Four periods can be distinguished in
Russian Arctic security policy in the post-Cold War era, with none
clearly directed at threatening the interests of other Arctic states.
Ekaterina Klimenko, writing for the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute, first notes an almost complete disbanding of Russian
Arctic forces in the 1990s, as the country was reeling from the Soviet
collapse.276 The 2000s then ushered a period of national power
restoration, notably through the State Rearmament Program, which
unsettled neighbors despite the spending targets remaining much more
modest than in the Soviet era.277 Klimenko notes for instance that while
the Program paid particular attention to the overhaul of Russia's
northern fleet, in particular for submarine patrols in the Arctic, the
number of operational submarines at Moscow's disposal actually fell by
three-quarters from 1986 to 2010.278 Klimenko then highlights a period
of attempted cooperation beginning [in 2008]{.underline}, as a key
Russian policy document insisted that [it was a **top strategic
priority** for Russia to keep the Arctic a "zone of **peace** and
**cooperation**."]{.underline}279 This posture presumably reflected the
fact that [[Russia]{.mark} **simply [cannot afford]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
substantially [fortify **its**]{.mark} **extremely [long]{.mark}
northern [coastline]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially considering that
the Russian military budget is only about a seventh of America's, and
that the country's economy was hit hard by plunging oil prices.280 In
any case, [this period was marked by Arctic **advances**]{.underline}
such as the Ilulissat Declaration of 2008, the Norway-Russia Agreement
on the Barents Sea in 2010, [and]{.underline} the setting up of Arctic
**[security roundtables]{.underline}**.281 Note also that
[**[Russia's]{.mark} 2013 Arctic [Strategy]{.mark}** [outlines
**exclusive**]{.mark}**ly [defens]{.mark}ive goals**]{.underline} for
Russian armed forces in the region, such as safeguarding sovereign
rights, providing strategic deterrence, and repelling aggression.282
Finally, the [[2014]{.underline}]{.mark} Ukraine crisis [[began]{.mark}
a period of **rapidly [deteriorating]{.mark} Russo-Western
[relations]{.mark}** and a **[strengthening]{.mark}** of
[Russia's]{.mark} Arctic [posture]{.mark}]{.underline}, for instance
[[through]{.mark} **large military [exercises]{.mark}**
[mirroring]{.mark} those of [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} and the setting
up of a Joint Strategic Command for Russia's northern forces.283
Klimenko notes, however, that many Russian military developments in the
region since 2013 are products of plans that were announced long before
the Ukraine crisis, such as the State Rearmament Program.284 So while it
may be expected that other Arctic States would seek, like Russia, to
proportionately protect their Arctic interests, there does not yet
appear to have been any particular event making Arctic militarization an
ineluctable necessity.285

Be that as it may, [the [Arctic]{.mark} is]{.underline} also [at
[risk]{.mark} of **[nuc]{.mark}lear [escalation]{.mark}**. Because it
represents [a]{.mark} **direct [way]{.mark}** [for the **two most
important nuc**]{.mark}**lear [powers]{.mark}** [to bomb each
other]{.mark}, it has been **regularly [patrolled]{.mark}** [by]{.mark}
**long-range [nuc]{.mark}lear [bombers]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} by
**nuclear-armed [sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} since the
Cold War.286 The mutual downsizing of arsenals after the collapse of the
Soviet Union did relax the nuclear danger for a time.287 Yet [tensions
are **on the rise** again after Washington noticed its withdraw from
the]{.underline} Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (**[ABM
Treaty]{.underline}**) roughly three months after 9/11.288 President
Bush claimed this move was necessary to defend against "terrorists who
strike without warning, or rogue states who seek weapons of mass
destruction," but [the ensuing development of]{.underline} ballistic
missile defense (**[BMD]{.underline}**) capabilities also
[**destabilized** the global nuclear balance]{.underline}.289 [[BMDs
fuel]{.mark} an **[arms race logic]{.mark}** insofar as [countering them
requires]{.mark} **firing [more missiles]{.mark}** than they can
intercept, so the expected response to U.S. BMD development by nuclear
powers not allied to Washington is to **maintain**, **modernize**,
and]{.underline} perhaps [**develop** their nuclear
arsenals]{.underline}.290 [BMDs are [**particularly relevant** to the
Arctic]{.mark} [because **the most important**]{.mark} **American BMD
[base]{.mark}** [is **Fort Greely**]{.mark} **in Alaska**]{.underline},
where dozens of ground-based mid-course defense (GMD) interceptors are
emplaced to defend against incoming ballistic missiles by intercepting
them midcourse.291 [Russia has]{.underline} in response
[deployed]{.underline} some [**S-400** missile defense
units]{.underline}, which are similar to American Patriot systems in
their multi-role ability to target both aircraft and ballistic missiles,
albeit with a greater range.292

[The Arctic [thaw could]{.mark} **further [destabilize]{.mark}** [the
global nuc]{.mark}lear [balance]{.mark}. It could [facilitate]{.mark}
the deployment of]{.underline} the American sea-based
**[[Aegis]{.underline}]{.mark}** BMD [[in the Arctic]{.mark}
Ocean]{.underline} (designed to intercept midcourse
short-to-intermediate range missiles), [as well as]{.underline} the
deployment of [**surface [anti-sub]{.mark}marine warfare
[capabilities]{.mark}** to hunt nuclear-armed
submarines]{.underline}.293 The development of [American BMD
capabilities in the Arctic could also [provoke **China** into developing
a **larger**]{.mark} **nuclear [arsenal]{.mark}** [and
**deepening**]{.mark} **military [coop]{.mark}eration** with
Russia]{.underline}, as Beijing is already actively developing
counter-measures against the development of U.S. BMD capabilities in the
Pacific.294 [The Doomsday Clock]{.underline} of the Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists now [suggests [we are]{.mark} **only ["two
minutes"]{.mark}** [away from]{.mark} **an apocalyptic
["midnight,"]{.mark}**]{.underline} closer than we were during the

### AT Turkey Doesn't Leave

#### If NATO humiliates Turkey, they'll leave

**Pandey 6-22** (Ansh Pandey, Associate Editor at TFIGlobal News,
TFIGlobal, June 22, 2022, "Turkey could quit NATO,"
<https://tfiglobalnews.com/2022/06/22/turkey-could-quit-nato/>; accessed
6/25/2022) ng

[Everything is not okay between NATO and Turkey, as [NATO]{.mark}
[wants]{.mark} to induct [Finland and Sweden]{.mark} into NATO.
[Turkey]{.mark} is quite adamant to [oppose]{.mark} the
motion]{.underline}. Erdogan stated that his opposition to Sweden and
Finland joining NATO is the Kurdish insurgency, which Turkey views as a
security danger.

But, **[[this is not the first time]{.mark} that [Turkey and NATO have
sparred]{.mark} with each other]{.underline}**. There have been many
more reasons earlier as well where Turkey has disagreed with NATO
allies. A famous case is [Jamal Khashoggi]{.underline} when [Turkey
started softening its stance with Saudi Arabia ditching NATO's
efforts.]{.underline}

You see, [Turkey has a sense of being exploited inside the
alliance]{.underline}, and so, for the first time ever,
[**[Turkey]{.mark} has [indicated]{.mark} that [it wants to leave the
alliance]{.mark} and explore more opportunities,** and it could prove to
be a major setback for NATO.]{.underline}

Media alarms NATO

Turkish media has openly started raising voices against its own allies
in NATO. Recently, a [[Turkish media]{.underline}]{.mark} has uploaded
an article against the US entitled, "US will not cut the NATO bond,
Turkey should". In this article, the author [[openly states]{.mark} and
proves, [why]{.mark} will [NATO and Turkey]{.mark} a[part]{.mark} their
[ways soon.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The article asserts that there is no single satisfactory answer to what
advantage Turkey and the Turkish people have seen in 70 years.
**[[Ankara has faced only humiliation]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

For instance, [[the US]{.mark} continues to [aid Greece]{.mark}, the
arch-nemesis of Turkey]{.underline}. With its new defence deal, the
United States has transformed Greece into an "American garrison"; [the
US has made a military build-up from Alexandroupoli to Crete which [is
clearly against Turkish interests]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Moreover, [Turkey is also concerned as the [US]{.mark} has
[pitched]{.mark} a new [NATO border with Greece, Southern Cyprus, and
Israel]{.mark} line carving out Turkey.]{.underline}

The author of the article also believes that [the US wants to keep
Turkey]{.underline} in NATO for multiple purposes, **[but [none of that
is beneficiary for Turkey]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The US wants to make
the Black sea a NATO lake; wants to continue Caucasus plans and
importantly, wants to dampen Greater Eurasia's dream. All of these serve
no substantial gain to Ankara.

What could Turkey do?

We all know very well that [Turkey is an opportunist country and it can
go to any extent to secure its gains]{.underline}. Talking along the
same lines, the article stresses that Turkey should close the Black Sea,
the Caucasus, and the Western gate of Central Asia for the USA, and
become a part of the Great Eurasian Partnership and the new world.

This all could be done at one cost which would be **[[leaving
NATO]{.mark}. [For Turkey]{.mark}, it [will be
worth]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[it]{.underline}**.]{.mark} The USA does
not want to cut ties with Turkey, it wants the nation to get anchored by
the West despite differences. Therefore, it is up to Turkey to cut that
bond.

[The article is indicative of the growing political atmosphere in
Ankara. **[It would not be a surprise if Turkey]{.mark} eventually
[quits]{.mark} NATO.**]{.underline}

There are also a number of observers who believe that [Turkey and the
West are moving **steadily**, even inexorably, toward a more formal,
**definitive** and acrimonious **break**.]{.underline} Like Tolstoy's
unhappy families, these scenarios are all disastrous in their own unique
way. Some imagine [Turkey **formally leaving NATO**, launching a nuclear
program or going to war with one of its neighbors. Some picture Turkey
**going rogue** like Iran, becoming **indebted** to China or entering
into an **alliance with Russia**]{.underline}. In many cases these
scenarios are accompanied by a more nakedly authoritarian turn in
Turkey's domestic politics, with Erdoğan forcibly overturning elections
and violently crushing protests.

Interestingly, pessimistic predictions vary in the degree to which they
see this geopolitical break as the fulfillment of Erdoğan's own
ideological agenda or the result of circumstances escalating beyond his
control. [Erdoğan has made it **clear** how **committed** he is to a
more "**independent**" Turkish foreign policy, one that would make his
country a civilizational and **geopolitical center** in its own right,
rather than a part of any other great power's sphere of
influence]{.underline}. He has also made it clear that he expects to
have to achieve this in the face of sustained Western resistance. Yet,
as laid out in the previous scenario, Erdoğan seems convinced that
Turkey's success in this venture will eventually bring Western powers
around. [Thus, while there is good reason to think Erdoğan's worldview
or **domestic** political **needs** might lead him to take provocative
measures that could **trigger a break**]{.underline}, it seems unlikely
that he would see the break as a goal in itself.

#### Even if Turkey doesn't [formally]{.underline} leave, the CP [still solves]{.underline} Turkish aggression. Punishment forces Erdogan to stop external aggression

**Ellis 20**, analyst @ Ekathimerini (Tom, "Time for the West to punish
Turkey," *Ekathimerini*,
<https://www.ekathimerini.com/opinion/258084/time-for-the-west-to-punish-turkey/>)

[If]{.underline} Turkish President Recep Tayyip [Erdogan achieves his
maximalist goals, it will be a huge defeat]{.underline} -- not just for
Greece, Cyprus and other countries in the region, but [for the **Western
system of stability and peace**]{.underline}. [To those]{.underline}
high-ranking US diplomats and officials from both parties [who cite the
"risk" of losing Turkey]{.underline} and see it evolve into a new
Pakistan or Iran, [the answer is that the country is not behaving as if
it is part of the Euro-Atlantic project and **should not be treated with
subtlety and criticism limited to mere rhetoric**]{.underline}. [Not
after Ankara purchased the Russian S-400, invaded Syria with the aim of
attacking the Kurds, got involved in Libya with forces and military
equipment and plays a negative role in the hostilities in
Nagorno-Karabakh]{.underline}. [Not to mention past allegations of
dealings with Islamic State]{.underline}. All this is before we mention
the numerous provocations that affect Hellenism, such as consecutive
navtexes near Kastellorizo's territorial water, surveying inside the
Cypriot exclusive economic zone, opening Varosha despite the
international outcry and UN resolutions, but also converting Hagia
Sophia into a mosque. [Turkey's complete impunity undermines the West's
credibility]{.underline}. [Erdogan has crossed every line]{.underline}.
He denounced the joint military exercises of Greek and American forces
in Thrace. Lately he is even turning against Turkish-Cypriot leader
Mustafa Akinci because he dares to refuse to align with Ankara's
appetites, and openly undermined him in order to make him lose the
elections in the occupied north of the island. [The Erdogan regime
insults everyone]{.underline}, from French President Emmanuel Macron to
US presidential nominee Joe Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and
Republicans in Congress who are critical of him. He invests exclusively
in his personal relationship with President Donald Trump -- whatever the
motives behind it. But even Trump has limits and priorities. When
Erdogan jailed pastor Andrew Brunson, angering the Evangelicals, a key
part of the US president's electoral pool, Trump threatened to "destroy"
the Turkish economy if the pastor was not released. The Turkish
president complied. To return to the issues that concern us, it is
obvious that other countries, no matter how friendly and supportive they
are to Greece, are not going to get involved in a military confrontation
on our account. **[Our allies and partners can]{.underline}**, however,
**[do enough damage to Turkey to force it to stop its
aggression]{.underline}**. It is in this light that, at last, the
imposition of severe and substantial sanctions that will really hurt the
Turkish economy must be seriously considered, both by the EU and the US.
It is a fact that we have witnessed direct criticism from the US State
Department against Turkey rarely seen in the past. It was preceded by
France, while Germany is also starting to raise -- slowly and belatedly
-- its voice. [Strong statements]{.underline} by the powerful players
that Erdogan counts on are a first step. They [send clear messages that
are **difficult** for the Turkish ruler to ignore]{.underline}. Athens
is always reaching out to Ankara for friendship and dialogue, proposing
that we delimit our maritime zones, stop the tension and reap the
benefits that will result. [If Erdogan continues the "calculated
provocations"]{.underline} -- which is how the Americans described them
and not the Greeks or Cypriots -- [the next step should be **targeted
sanctions** that will seriously affect Turkey]{.underline}. At the same
time, the readiness of the Greek armed forces completes the puzzle of
the potential cost that Erdogan is called upon to bear. As Turkish
forces are spread too thin and on so many fronts, he must realize that
in the event of a conflict, Turkey will pay a heavy price too. **[The
West must punish the Turkish leader]{.underline}**. [He has turned his
country into a pariah and he must be made to understand that **he is not
invincible** -- before it's too late]{.underline}.

### AT Expulsion Bad\-\--Top-Shelf

#### The alliance is over. [Any benefit]{.underline} to Turkish membership is [long-dead]{.underline}. Kicking them out just formalizes it.

**GM 19** (Geopolitical Monitor, "Point Counterpoint: Turkey Should Be
Expelled from NATO,"
<https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/point-counterpoint-turkey-should-be-expelled-from-nato/)//BB>

As such, many claim that [ousting Ankara from NATO]{.underline} is an
option to be seriously considered. In principle, this [raises costs in
the form of losing a powerful partner in a strategic position, but in
practice the problem may be **less serious than it
appears.**]{.underline} [The assets currently based on Turkish territory
can be moved to more trustworthy partners, even though this would have
some operational consequences]{.underline}. [Most importantly, Turkey's
own uncooperative, if not outright abrasive, attitude **already
offsets** the advantages its membership is supposed to
bring]{.underline}. At the same time, [expelling Turkey would allow the
Organization and its members to simply counter Ankara whenever the
latter's actions go against its common interests, and NATO would be
freed from any obligation to protect an untrustworthy ally that does
little to promote the common interest and often acts openly against it
in a manner that **undermines NATO's cohesion and
policies**]{.underline}. As such, [Ankara's exit from NATO would put an
end to the numerous problems linked to its membership]{.underline}. And,
arguably, **[it's the Turkish government itself that is choosing this
path]{.underline}**. [Ankara's recent tilts toward rival powers like
Russia and Iran seems to indicate that it is already drifting away from
its trans-Atlantic commitments]{.underline}; therefore, [expelling the
country from NATO would **simply make official** the de facto break-up
that Turkey has been actively seeking over the past decade]{.underline}.

### AT Expulsion Bad\-\--Countering Russia

#### Turkey is actively working to help Russia and Iran, against US interests 

**Rubin 21** - is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute (Michael Rubin, "To Use Turkey as a Bulwark Against Russia and
Iran Is Wishful Thinking," July 12 2021,
<https://nationalinterest.org/feature/use-turkey-bulwark-against-russia-and-iran-wishful-thinking-189524)//mcu>

[For decades, Turkey was a staunch Cold War ally]{.underline}. One of
only two NATO members to border the Soviet Union, [Turkey went above and
beyond]{.underline} in its partnership with the United States: Turkey
contributed more men under arms to NATO than Germany and France
combined. Turkey subsequently joined the Baghdad Pact and Turks fought
alongside the United States in the Korean War. Behind the scenes, Turkey
proved crucial to numerous intelligence and counter-terror operations.
[With the end of the Cold War, bilateral relations remained
strong]{.underline}, at least **[until the rise of]{.underline}**
Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip **[Erdoğan]{.underline}**. Slowly
but deliberately, [Erdoğan turned away from the West]{.underline}. He
picked fights like a master tactician, confident that he could find
former ambassadors and others in the State Department, White House, or
pay-to-play think tanks. He artfully played and rewarded those inclined
to apologize for any Turkish outrage or desperate to preserve the
alliance. The frequency of U.S. elections and new U.S.
administrations---at least in comparison to the last two decades in
Turkey---meant Erdoğan could always find an American official eager for
a reset. Often, [those seeking to promote rapprochement with Turkey
argue that repairing the relationship is necessary given the broader
strategic imperative of checking Russia's and Iran's geopolitical
ambitions. **The idea that Turkey can be a bulwark against either is
magical thinking**]{.underline}. [It rests upon an embrace of an
Istanbul bubble not representative of broader Turkish
thinking]{.underline}, [a wholescale embrace of]{.underline} the notion
that [Turkey's depiction]{.underline} of its enemies and its narrative
[of history]{.underline} is accurate, [and an anachronistic idea that
Turkey has not changed over the decades]{.underline}. The idea that it
is possible to ignore the ideology and volatility in Erdoğan is
analogous to embracing Iranian reformists in the hope that they will
somehow nullify the influence of the supreme leader. Likewise, [to
believe that nearly two decades of Erdoğanism has not changed Turkish
society is to believe that twenty years of Khomeinism did not change
Iran. Both are foolish delusions.]{.underline} Consider, for example,
the notion that **[Turkey checks Russia's interests]{.underline}**. In
May 2010, [Russia and Turkey signed energy cooperation agreements to
give Turkey its first nuclear power plant,]{.underline} with help from
Russian energy companies. Earlier this year, Russian president Vladimir
Putin and Erdoğan jointly celebrated the start of the construction of
the new Akkuyu power plant. **[Such cooperation has become the rule
rather than the exception]{.underline}**. [Turkey's purchase of
S-400]{.underline} missiles from Russia has made headlines not because
it represents a lucrative contract for Russia, but because the
integration of S-400s into Turkey's air defense would **[require
compromising NATO electronics and computer codes to Russian
engineers.]{.underline}** [Even if Turkey kept the S-400s on a separate
system, they might be used to track and gather data on NATO air
platforms.]{.underline} In 2016, the two counties signed an agreement on
the TurkStream gas pipeline and, on January 8, 2020, they launched the
pipeline. To suggest Germany's pursuit of Nord Stream 2 is pro-Putin (it
is) but, by omission, bless Turkey's involvement in the TurkStream
pipeline defies logic. [Syria has become a flashpoint for Turkey's
Islamist ambitions]{.underline}. The reason why American officials from
both parties ignore Turkish complaints about U.S. partnership with
pro-PKK groups is not because of some conspiracy to promote Russian or
Iranian interest as some suggest, but rather because Turkey's
partnership with the Islamic State forced that cooperation in the first
place. Given how Turkey and Russia often appear on separate sides in the
Syria conflict[, it might be possible to argue that Turkey's involvement
checks Russian ambitions]{.underline}. The problem,
**[however]{.underline}**, is that **[Turkey's approach to Syrian
president Bashar al-Assad is inconsistent]{.underline}**. In May 2007,
the PKK derailed a train in Turkey that was carrying rocket launchers,
mortar shells, and light arms to Syria, likely destined to Hezbollah.
For example, in 2008 and 2009 Erdoğan was hosting joint cabinet meetings
with Assad and vacationing with the Syrian dictator on the coast of the
Mediterranean Sea. Certainly, the Syrian civil war changed perspectives
but, on January 24, 2017, [Russia, Turkey, and Iran signed an agreement
to establish de-escalation zones and essentially cooperate to create
spheres of influence in Syria]{.underline}. Damascus and Ankara
replicated the same model in Libya and in Nagorno-Karabakh as well.
Officials in both Armenia and Artsakh---as the self-styled Armenian
state in Nagorno-Karabakh calls itself---openly speculate that [Turkey
traded influence in Idlib to Russia in exchange for the Kremlin agreeing
to greater Turkish involvement in the South Caucasus.]{.underline} It is
true that [Turkey's relationship with Russia has not always gone
smoothly]{.underline}. In October 2012, Turkey forced a Syrian passenger
plane to land, accusing it of carrying Russian munitions leading Russian
officials to accuse Turkey of endangering Russian passengers. Three
years later, Turkey shot down a Russian military jet close to the Syrian
border. Putin called the move a "stab in the back." Russia suspended
military contracts, instituted a travel ban against Turkey, and
implemented sanctions in response. After Erdoğan apologized**[, however,
Russo-Turkish relations resumed where they had left off]{.underline}**.
Erdoğan's use of the Gülen bogeyman to deflect blame from the
consequences from his own policy choices proved useful in papering over
other crises, such as when an off-duty Turkish police officer
assassinated the Russian ambassador to Turkey. [Certainly, tensions
remain]{.underline} and the Kremlin is not afraid to play hardball with
Erdoğan but whether out of ideological symbiosis or trade, **[neither
Erdoğan nor Putin appears willing to break their embrace]{.underline}**.
The two leaders have met nearly two dozen times in either Turkey or
Russia since 2012, and that figure does not include phone calls, video
conferences, or mutual attendance at multiparty summits in third
countries. Nor does it factor in Turkish intelligence chief Hakan
Fidan's frequent travels to Moscow. The money at stake is significant.
In 2019, Turkey's exports to Russia totaled \$4.15 billion, and Russian
exports to Turkey were five times that amount. It is likewise farcical
to believe Turkey can be a bulwark against Iranian influence. When, in
2010, [Erdoğan appointed Fidan]{.underline} to be his intelligence
chief, alarm bells sounded in Western capitals where his Western
counterparts knew him as [an Iran sympathizer if not an
asset]{.underline}. To couch a renewed Turkish alliance as good for
Israel or Jews is absurd. [Fidan not only personally supervised efforts
to unravel Turkey-Israel ties but also ordered Turkish intelligence
actively to monitor Jews.]{.underline} He killed two birds with one
stone when [he allegedly exposed an Israeli spy ring targeting Iran's
nuclear program and has also betrayed intelligence to Hamas and
China.]{.underline} [Under Fidan]{.underline}, [Turkey]{.underline} also
[endangered American forces by exposing the locations and supplies of
U.S. forces operating in Syria.]{.underline} To suggest, in each case,
that Turkey is simply acting in pique toward some sleight or following
its own interests misses the point. [Strong allies share not only
short-term interests but also a broader ideological base]{.underline}.
This has been the key to ensuring the stability of the post--World War
II liberal order. [The Turkish government,]{.underline} however, **[no
longer shares common values with the United States or the
West]{.underline}.** Nor after two decades bombarded by vile
anti-Western, anti-Semitic propaganda does a Turkish public, at least
that beyond a few central Istanbul neighborhoods, some more cosmopolitan
areas in Ankara, and the Mediterranean coast. Forty percent of the
Turkish population has lived the entirety of their conscious lives under
Erdoğan's domination. To excuse Erdoğan as transactional is equally
bizarre. In times of crises, allies do not seek to engage both sides in
a bidding war for Turkey's affection but that is at best what Erdoğan
now tries to do. Turkey is skilled at caviar diplomacy; I know. While I
never solicited nor received Turkish money (or that of any other foreign
state), I was a frequent guest at Turkish conferences until the Erdoğan
regime grew frustrated with both my refusal to promote its party line
and my willingness to talk directly in the spirit of independent
research to those it deemed enemies. [Turkey continues to throw out the
red carpet for those who amplify its narrative and offers golden
parachutes for diplomats who amplify Turkish interests]{.underline}.
Conversely, it [restricts access to academics and policy analysts who do
not tow its party line.]{.underline} Such [enticement]{.underline},
however, [is]{.underline} not only intellectually dishonest but also
makes for [buffoonish]{.underline} policy prescriptions, the notion
[that Turkey today can be a bulwark against Russia and Iran chief among
them.]{.underline}

[The **economic crisis** is]{.underline} perhaps [the **single most

#### No Middle East escalation

Islamabad : There is a need to [study the causes of proxy
wars]{.underline}, and what are the potential impacts of such wars on
the overall conflict. These thoughts in a daylong international seminar
on 'Strategic Dimensions of Peace and Conflict in South Asia and the
[Middle East]{.underline},' organised by Pak Institute for Peace Studies
(PIPS), an Islamabad-based think tank[, participated by prominent
national and international scholars]{.underline}. Prof. Shahram
Akbarzadeh, Deakin University, Australia, argued there is significant
gap in the literature on non-state actors. He called for empirical
research, along with concrete policy suggestions, on the topic, so as to
mitigate the conflicts in the region, in particular South Asia and
Middle East. Speakers grappled at the notion of non-state actors and
proxy wars: PIPS director Muhammad Amir Rana said non-state actors often
evoke memories of violent elements. This despite that as per definition,
non-state actors include organizations working for human rights. Prof.
Syed Rifaat Hussain, Department of Government and Public Policy, NUST,
said the term "proxy wars" is a contested notion. There is no universal
agreement on its definition, nor on the set of circumstances behind such
wars. Interestingly, he said, proxy wars are as old as the phenomena of
conventional war itself. Speakers noted [proxy wars are instruments of
state power]{.underline}. As to why states go for it, it was argued, it
is because [they are often cheap undertaking to change the status
quo.]{.underline} Participants noted over the decades, much of the
conflict involves non-state actors. [Interstate conflict]{.underline},
on the other hand, [has declined]{.underline}. In recent times, he said
**[tit-for-tat tactics on behalf of such actors have reduced their
appeal.]{.underline}** Dr. Ibrahim Fraihat, Doha Institute of Graduate
Studies, Doha, termed proxy war as an arms conflict between two parties,
though one of them is not directly involved. This way, domestic
conflicts are escalated by external power intervention. At the same
time, proxy war, if unresolved, can take the shape of conventional war,
the most significant example was of Vietnam War. In contemporary times,
he lamented, [the Middle East has been rendered a stock market of proxy
organizations.]{.underline} William Gueriache, Associate Professor
American University in the Emirates Dubai, said on surface, all states
support open diplomacy and multilateralism. Yet the survival of
patronage has paved the way for foreign intervention during conflicts in
the whole Middle East. Dr. Marwan Kablan, Director Policy Analysis at
the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies Doha, also hinted
multiplicity of actors involved in Syrian conflict, calling it as mother
of conflicts in the region. It was said that wars cannot be ended unless
patron states achieve their interests. Dr. Shaheen Akhtar, Professor
National Defence University Islamabad focused on the apprehension of
Pakistan about India's involvement in Afghanistan. She said Pakistan's
uneasy relationship with Kabul reinforces a perception of encirclement
while growing US-India strategic cooperation further aggravates these
apprehensions. Dr. Muhammad Riaz Shad, National University of Modern
Languages (NUML) Islamabad, said **[fighting through proxies gives
states an opportunity of deniability.]{.underline}**

#### [No]{.underline} great power involvement in Middle East war\-\--[every]{.underline} external actor will [limit damage]{.underline} from regional instability [rather than]{.underline} get involved 

Ekaterina **Stepanova 16**, researcher at the Institute of World Economy
and International Relations, Summer 2016, "Russia in the Middle East:
Back to a "Grand Strategy" -- or Enforcing Multilateralism?"
http://www.cairn-int.info/article-E_PE_162_0023\--russia-in-the-middle-east.htm

[[**In contrast** to]{.underline}]{.mark} the 20th century and [[the
early]{.mark} years of the [21st century, the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[regional [crisis in the 2010s]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[developed]{.underline}]{.mark} at a time [[when]{.underline}]{.mark},
overall, [[the **role and leverage of major powers** external to the
Middle East, as]{.underline}]{.mark} either [active [meddlers or
security guarantors]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region, or both,
actually [**[declined]{.mark} rather than increased**. The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [serves as the most evident
case in point]{.underline}: the "post-interventionist" US administration
has clearly become "tired of the Middle East", struggling and often
failing to keep pace with the dynamically changing situation and unable
to alter or decisively affect the course of events. [The same even more
strongly applies to the European powers]{.underline}. In terms of
activity and impact, **[regional actors]{.underline}** (Iran, Saudi
Arabia, Qatar, UAE and Turkey) increasingly [appeared to outplay
external powers and influence]{.underline}.

For external powers, however, that did not remove a number of risks and
threats connected to, or emanating from, the Middle East. The increase
and diversification of global energy supply and the latest crisis in
energy prices made the region less central to the global economy than it
had been in the past. At the same time, the fundamental socio-political,
statehood and security crisis in the Middle East brought with it new
security concerns and implications. They mostly stemmed from reinforced
perceptions about the long-term nature of regional instability, the
continuing potential for further destabilization, and the related
consequences and implications beyond the region, ranging from terrorist
connections to migration flows. These challenges affect external powers
unevenly. For instance, the role of the Iraq-Syria area as the main
focal point for global terrorism activity and magnet for transnational
flows of violent extremists in the mid-2010s poses a threat to everyone
(but mostly to the countries of the region itself, as well as to those
in Europe and Eurasia). In contrast, the avalanche of refugee and
migrant flows from the Middle East primarily targets Europe (rather than
North America, Eurasia, or other regions).

Until recently, [[the main]{.underline}]{.mark} type of
[[response]{.mark} by key]{.underline} (Western) [external powers to
turbulent developments in the Middle East]{.underline}, while not
amounting to a hands-off approach, [[boils down to **limited
containment**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Examples range from limited air
strikes against "Islamic State" positions in Iraq and Syria, carried out
by the US-led coalition since 2014, to the 2013 deal on Syria's chemical
disarmament co-brokered by the United States and Russia. Not
surprisingly, this limited-containment approach has had equally limited
results for Syria, Iraq and the region -- as well as for the West itself
(as shown, e.g., by the persistent migrant flows and accelerating
terrorist attacks in Europe). [[Despite the]{.mark} growing [centrality
of the Middle East to global politics]{.mark} and security]{.underline},
and its more direct impact on and ties to the West, [[this **damage
limitation** course]{.mark} taken by key external actors [has not
been]{.mark} very [different from]{.mark}]{.underline}, e.g., [[the
approach]{.mark} taken [by the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates and its Western allies (and also by
[[Russia and China]{.mark}) [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[Afghanistan]{.underline}]{.mark} problem in recent years.

#### No scenario for draw in, even with military presence.

Cato Institute., 1-9-2017, \"Does the U.S. Military Actually Protect
Middle East Oil?,\" National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-skeptics/does-the-us-military-actually-protect-middle-east-oil-18995?page=0%2C1

In addition, the balance of power globally and in the region today is
favorable for energy security. [First, an [external power gaining
a]{.mark} [stranglehold]{.mark} over the Persian Gulf region [is
implausible]{.mark}. The Soviet Union is long gone and today's [Russia
**suffers from**]{.mark} **systemic [economic problems that hinder its
potential]{.mark} to project power [in the]{.mark} [Middle
East]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [[China]{.mark}, while increasingly
powerful in its own sphere, [lacks]{.mark} the political [will]{.mark}
to dominate the Gulf . The regional balance of power is also
favorable]{.underline}. According to Joshua Rovner , "[the chance that a
regional hegemon will emerge in the Persian Gulf during the next twenty
years is slim to none.]{.underline} [This is true even if the United
States withdraws completely." **[No state]{.mark} in the region
[possesses the capabilities necessary to conquer neighboring territories
or gain]{.mark} a [controlling influence]{.mark} over oil resources, and
[most are bogged down]{.mark} and distracted [by internal
problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Overall the region is in a state of
defense dominance]{.underline}: [while too weak to project power beyond
their borders, the major states do have the capability to deter their
neighbors, **[making the costs of offensive action prohibitively
high.]{.mark}** So, three of the major scenarios that have traditionally
justified a forward deployed military presence in the Persian Gulf---the
entrance of a hostile external power, the rise of a regional hegemon and
a [military clash]{.mark} among the major states]{.underline}---**[[are
exceedingly unlikely even absent the U.S. military
presence.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### No Middle East war\-\--states are too weak and deterrence solves

Regionally, the circumstances are similarly advantageous. According to
Rovner, "[the [chance]{.mark} that [a regional hegemon will
emerge]{.mark} in the Persian Gulf [during the next twenty years is
**slim**]{.mark} **to none**]{.underline}. This is true even if the
United States withdraws completely." 134 There are only three potential
major powers in the region: [[Iraq, Iran, and Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}. [**[None of them possesses the capabilities
necessary]{.mark}** [to conquer neighboring territories or gain]{.mark}
a controlling [influence]{.mark} over Persian Gulf]{.underline} oil
resources. In addition to being too weak to make a bid for regional
dominance, [[all three are **bogged down**]{.mark} and distracted [by
internal problems]{.mark}]{.underline}. Overall, [the region is in a
state of defense dominance]{.underline}: the [[major states are too weak
to project power]{.mark} beyond their borders]{.underline},
[[but]{.mark} they do [have the capability to deter]{.mark} their
[neighbors]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Deterrence works well in this
environment]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[because]{.mark} the [costs of
offensive action remain **prohibitively high**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 135

Ask 10 experts on Turkish politics whether the United States should

denials. Get beyond the Washington Beltway and you'll get something
different. [The Israelis worry]{.underline} Turkish President Recep

its own nuclear weapons, is party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and has ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty. So, [what suggests Turkey may want to go nuclear in the
not too distant future?]{.underline} Three things. First, President
**[[Erdogan]{.mark} says he [wants the bomb]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Last
fall, [he complained before the UN]{.underline} General Assembly that
[the NPT bars states like Turkey from developing nuclear weapons but
ignores that other states have them]{.underline}. Earlier, he told
members of his Justice and Development Party that "some countries have
missiles with nuclear warheads, not one or two. But \[they tell us\] we
can't have them. This, I cannot accept." He then said nuclear weapons
are an enormous source of power for Israel. Second, **[Erdogan is often
bombastic]{.underline}**, [but on nuclear energy he's taking
action]{.underline}. Along Turkey's Mediterranean coastline, [the
[Russians are building]{.mark} four large civilian [nuclear power
reactors]{.mark} at the Akkuyu Nuclear Facility]{.underline}. [Erdogan
hopes the Russians will complete the first reactor by 2023]{.underline},
in time for the centenary celebrations of the founding of modern
Turkey[. Ankara says it needs nuclear energy to decrease its dependence
on natural gas imports from unreliable partners---Russia and
Iran]{.underline}---[and to meet electricity demand]{.underline}. This
demand has grown at the highest rate of all OECD countries since 2005.
[But **Ankara's case for nuclear power doesn't add up**]{.underline}.
[The Akkuyu facility doesn't make Turkey less dependent on foreign
powers. Russia will own and operate the facility, and it is
well-established that Moscow uses all of its energy
assets]{.underline}---not just fossil fuels---**[for
coercion]{.underline}**. Actually, the Akkuyu plant is a bad investment.
While Rosatom, Russia's state-owned nuclear energy corporation, is
footing the bill for the first reactor, it will not do the same for
Akkuyu's other three reactors. Despite years of searching, the Russians
haven't found a single private investor for the project. To finish
Akkuyu, the Turkish government will have to finance it through public
debt or secure increasingly scarce foreign investment. If President
Erdogan were paying attention to the market, he would know that natural
gas and renewables beat nuclear. Even before the pandemic, Turkey was
importing natural gas for a fraction of the Akkuyu plant's market
electricity price---an uneconomic 12.35 cents per kilowatt hour. And
Turkish access to gas will soon expand; by backing the interim
government in Libya that enjoys UN support, Turkey scored cheap gas and
drilling rights in Libya's maritime zone. More natural gas will allow
Turkey to meet electricity demand today. Cheap domestic renewables
should help it tomorrow. As it stands, 10 percent of Turkish electricity
comes from solar and wind. One of Turkey's top universities recently
reported that these sources could meet 30 percent of Turkey's
electricity demand by 2026, given proper investment. An objective
observer must wonder why bad economics hasn't dampened Erdogan's nuclear
ambitions. What's worrisome is **[[Turkey could exploit nuclear power as
a cover to procure bomb-related techno]{.mark}logy and
hardware]{.underline}**. [The technology transfer is already
occurring.]{.underline} Since the Akkuyu project began, [[Turkish
engineering students]{.mark} have become the second largest national
group [studying nuclear sciences in Russia]{.mark}, where hundreds of
Iranian and North Korean scientists came before them]{.underline}. While
Russia was building Iran's civilian power facility at Bushehr, side
agreements led to the transfer of equipment and exchange of scientists,
which assisted Iran's weapons program at other sites. These actions
fooled US intelligence (who believed Iran had stopped its weapons
program between 2003 and 2007) and international inspectors. [[Many
experts doubt]{.mark} that Turkey would ever go nuclear. They
[emphasize]{.mark} that [Turkey]{.mark} has [signed]{.mark}]{.underline}
an additional protocol agreement with the [[International Atomic Energy
Agency]{.mark}, opening the country up to closer inspections than
Iran]{.underline} had to prevent military diversions of nuclear fuel.
The fuel, however, isn't the only issue. [As a major study of Iran and
similar cases detailed]{.underline} a decade ago, the [[agency
is]{.mark} [disadvantaged in tracking the intangible technology and
dual-use transfers]{.mark} that are critical to bomb
making.]{.underline}

### NATO-Turkey Coop Good

#### Cooperation with Turkey [draws them into]{.underline} NATO-led initiatives

States and Europe\'s Turkey Project at Brookings, with an expertise in
Turkish foreign policy and migration studies. From 2013 until 2020, he

However, **[all is not lost]{.underline}**. [The Ukrainian crisis has
increasing questions about the wisdom of Turkey's cozy relationship with
Russia and a **greater appreciation of NATO's value**]{.underline},
[recently reiterated by]{.underline} [two prominent retired Turkish
ambassadors]{.underline}. Interestingly, their reasoning is not that
different than the Turkish diplomats and ministers of foreign affairs
from the 1940s and 1950s who played a central role in negotiating
Turkey's entry into NATO, revealing the continuity that comes with
geography but also the persistent commitment to a Western vocation
dating from Ottoman times. Moving forward, revitalizing Turkey's
traditional Western vocation and its NATO membership will be dependent
on two developments. Erdoğan is failing to address Turkey's mounting
problems. His approval ratings have dropped from almost 56% at the start
of the COVID-19 pandemic to 38.6% at the end of 2021, while the
governing AKP has also steadily lost support and was down to 23.9%.
Under these circumstances, the opposition stands a growing chance of
winning the next elections if they are reasonably free. However, the
opposition led by the social democratic People's Republican Party (CHP)
has remained by and large quiet on foreign policy issues and shied from
advocating pro-Western policies. This would need to change, and the
opposition would need to adopt an informed and rational platform that
dispels prejudices and better explains to the public why revitalizing
stronger relations with the West would benefit Turkey's interests.
**[The West needs to do its part]{.underline}** too. Foremost, [there
needs to be a recognition that there is political change in the offing
in Turkey]{.underline}. It is far from certain but there is a decent
likelihood that the next elections would be won by the opposition. In
the meantime, [it will be important for the U.S. to
recognize]{.underline} that the current crisis over Ukraine has once
more shown **[the strategic value of Turkey to NATO]{.underline}** and
develop, **[together with other allies]{.underline}**, a constructive
narrative that would welcome a post-election Turkey back into the core
of the trans-Atlantic alliance. Given the stalling out of its
enlargement process, the EU is unlikely to be able to play the robust
role it did in reforming Turkish democracy in the 2000s. But just like
70 years ago, Turkey's **[NATO]{.underline}** membership [could become a
conduit for]{.underline} mutually reinforcing [Turkey's Western vocation
and its democracy while benefiting European security]{.underline},
including that of Ukraine.

[Ultimately]{.underline}, however, [fears of a Turkish realignment with
Russia are]{.underline} likely [overblown. Moscow and Ankara's relations
have]{.underline} historically [been fraught, and the recent
rapprochement stems]{.underline} more [from opportunism]{.underline}
[and coinciding interests]{.underline} than a major reorientation in
Turkish foreign policy at the expense of its traditional alliances. In
fact, [Turkey's forceful posturing is making it]{.underline} steadily
[more at odds with Russia in conflict environments]{.underline} where
both operate, including Nagorno-Karabakh, Syria, and Libya. Its growing
involvement in the Caucasus, for instance, has brought it dangerously
close to armed confrontation with NATO's primary contestant, Russia,
which supports Armenia under the Collective Security Treaty Organization
framework. This was highlighted by Russian President Vladimir Putin's
underscoring of Russia's "obligations to Armenia." Though the violence
ended there, Turkey's proxy saber-rattling contributes to increase risks
of accident or miscalculation leading to armed confrontation with Russia
--- something all parties are eager to avoid. With antagonistic security
interests at stake, [Turkey and Russia are ultimately more likely to
balance against rather than align with each other,]{.underline} though
several NATO allies continue to regard Ankara's ties to Moscow with a
deep-seated sense of suspicion. A Constructive Role for NATO [As Turkey
and the E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [ramp up their
rhetorical joust, it is]{.underline} perhaps [no surprise that **NATO is
better placed to act as a forum for the de-escalation of the crisis**.
It is]{.underline} indeed [Turkey's membership to NATO]{.underline}, and
the daily staff-to-staff contacts which it generates, [that makes the
alliance able to work as a platform where]{.underline} their [diplomats
can negotiate, exchange information, and address issues]{.underline} of
common strategic interest with European counterparts, [thus helping to
undermine the "us-versus-them" mentality]{.underline} which at times
prevails across E.U. institutions. [As the latter hardens its rhetoric,
**NATO can generate the much-needed safety valve where diplomatic
efforts have a chance of succeeding.**]{.underline} To this end, [the
alliance should capitalize on the consultative function of its
institutions to allow for parties to sit together, express their views
and concerns]{.underline} on national and collective security
considerations, [and improve mechanisms to reach a
consensus]{.underline} on the means to address any perceived challenges.
[Consultations]{.underline} have indeed always been at the core of the
alliance, and [remain important vectors for addressing intermember
disagreements]{.underline}. The [recent announcement]{.underline}
[by]{.underline} NATO Secretary General Jens [Stoltenberg that
a]{.underline} military [de-confliction mechanism would be established
between Greece and Turkey is]{.underline} but [one example of the
productive results that such diplomatic efforts]{.underline} can [yield,
and an encouraging sign that the two sides are not willing to see their
relations deteriorate further.]{.underline} Yet a limited arrangement
between Greece and Turkey is also unlikely to address the deep-seated
causes of the political turmoil between Ankara and European allies, and
[NATO should find new and improved ways to act as a forum to discuss,
and]{.underline} to [act]{.underline}, where necessary, [on issues
**affecting the security interests of its member states**. This is key
if the organization wants to remain flexible and relevant in the
increasingly contested and fast-paced security environment of
today.]{.underline}

[While the current standoff between Turkey and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [appears to be moving]{.underline} from bad [to
worse, **it has yet to reach** a breaking point or a **point of no
return.** Although tensions and policy differences continue to plague
US-Turkish relations, efforts by]{.underline} well-meaning
[policymakers]{.underline} within the US government and Turkey's
civilian and military establishment **[point to]{.underline}** perhaps
[**better days to come**, given the resilience and endurance of the
**ties that bind the two nations together**. The US perspective on
Turkey could be traced to many factors, starting with]{.underline} the
[refusal of]{.underline} the [Turkish Parliament to allow US forces to
transit Turkish territory to attack Iraq]{.underline} in 2003 and the
slow Turkish support for the US-led coalition against ISIS. [Turkey
is]{.underline} also [being put on notice by the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [for feuding against other NATO
allies]{.underline}---namely, Germany, the Netherlands, Cyprus, France,
and Greece. In the last case, tensio[ns have been brewing in recent
months over]{.underline} new [border disputes in]{.underline} the Aegean
and the refusal of [Greece]{.underline} to extradite a group of Turkish
officers allegedly involved in the failed coup. Although resolving the
Cyprus issue remains high on the US agenda, [tensions between Turkey and
Cyprus over oil and gas exploration rights and access]{.underline} off
the coast of Cyprus [are forcing the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and the European Union to side with Cyprus and even
entertain sending US naval ships to protect Cypriot gas and oil tracks
at sea. [Despite these and other policy differences]{.underline} over
Syria and other domestic problems facing Turkey, [**both sides seem
reluctant to cause irreparable damage to their alliance**. The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, which [has traditional ties
with Turkey, does not want a military confrontation]{.underline} with
the country over Syria. The most hopeful sign of addressing some of the
protracted problems currently facing US-Turkish relations stems from the
fact that [Turkey is still seen by the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [as important to America's national
security]{.underline} interests, especially [given Turkey's]{.underline}
geostrategic [location and]{.underline} cultural [familiarity with its
volatile neighbors. Turkey]{.underline} is currently self-absorbed with
its ambitions and Muslim neo-Ottoman nationalist revivalism, but its
unique ballot-box democracy, albeit imperfect by Western standards,
**[will work toward increasing harmonization toward the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and its NATO allies in
the long run. This can only happen through a sustained strategic
dialogue.]{.underline}** The idea is to keep Turkey and the United
States engaged while trying to find solutions to the issues that
separate them, because once the current tactical posturing is stripped
away, the strategic alliance becomes more visible. [There
is]{.underline} indeed current [evidence for better US-NATO-Turkish
cross-cultural communication techniques to manage and
resolve]{.underline} outstanding [policy and strategic
differences.]{.underline} In short, [**Turkey is not yet lost**, but
there are challenges]{.underline} facing America and its NATO partners
in how to bridge the growing gap between them and Turkey. This challenge
touches on a fundamental question: What kind of strategic relation- ship
do the United States, NATO, and Turkey want or desire? Clearly, [they
are at a]{.underline} policy and strategic [cross- road.]{.underline}
The answer lies in the need for the United States to craft a new
strategy toward Turkey and vice versa that takes into account the new
realities of Turkish, NATO, and American domestic political dynamics,
their changing nature and character, as well as Tur- key's quest for
regional influence and ambitions and its goal of becoming a great
regional power. **[Turkey, NATO, and the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [**share Western values, and** **these
values**,]{.underline} although not equal for all partners, **[are keys
to better multicultural harmony if applied properly]{.underline}**
across the board.

[Despite]{.underline} the [considerable]{.underline} degree of
[divergence, Ankara acts in parallel but not]{.underline} necessarily
[against the EU and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. In the
grand scheme of things, [Turkey is tightly connected to the European
economy]{.underline}, a fact highlighted by the ongoing recession, which
puts at risk EU investors too. [Turkish trade with EU
members]{.underline} Romania, Greece and Bulgaria [is]{.underline} by
far more [significant]{.underline} than with the Western Balkans, though
Serbia is picking up too. On the security side, [Turkey pursues a policy
independently of NATO]{.underline} and has deepened ties to Russia.
**[Yet, it remains part of the Alliance and contributes to its
initiatives, including those aimed to deter Moscow.]{.underline}** When
it comes to the Balkans, [Turkey]{.underline} has no alternative to
offer to local countries to woo them away from Euro- Atlantic
institutions. Its [resources are limited]{.underline}, too, [in
comparison]{.underline} [with the]{.underline} collective
[West]{.underline}. What is also important is that Balkan elites do not
necessarily see a trade-off between ties to Western organizations and to
Turkey. That is clearly visible in the policy of non-aligned Serbia,
which has also been courting Russia, China and the Gulf while
negotiating its membership in the EU. But it is also the case of
Bulgaria which has emerged as a leading advocate of engagement with
Turkey within the Union. [The only country]{.underline} in Southeast
Europe [which has deep-seated concerns]{.underline} and fears [about
Turkish expansionism is Greece,]{.underline} which has long-standing
territorial disputes with its neighbour only made worse by the looming
conflict over offshore gas deposits in the proximity of Cyprus. [But
Greek policymakers have demonstrated the capacity to be flexible and
deescalate tensions]{.underline} (Christofis in this issue). [Turkey is
embedded in the politics, economies and societies of the
Balkans]{.underline}. It is an autonomous player, and the cult of
Erdoğan has become central to its presence in the region, often with
divisive effects. [However, **there is no evidence that its actions or
policies are geared at replacing the West** as the lynchpin of regional
order. Rather, **Turkey is pursuing a parallel policy,
which**]{.underline} at times **[overlaps with that of
the]{.underline}** EU, **[US and NATO.]{.underline}**

In the recent decade, [the U.S. has pursued a strategy to
support]{.underline} armed [Kurdish groups]{.underline} to repel radical
Islamic terror groups, particularly ISIS. [Nevertheless, Turkey has
become increasingly concerned]{.underline} about the strengthening of
the Kurdish administration and its nationalist ambitions. [These
concerns are pushing Turkey into the arms of U.S. rivals]{.underline} in
the region. Both Iran and Russia are expanding their authority in the
region by establishing political and military support for radical
regimes such as Assad's in Syria and political and militant movements
like Hezbollah. These s[trategic policies are increasingly connecting
Iran's and Russia's allies in an ever-strengthening regional security
complex]{.underline}. Given these regional circumstances, [Turkey finds
itself flip-flopping between these rival regional security
complexes.]{.underline} The primary cause for current problems in
U.S.-Turkey relations is not simply the recent actions of the two
countries. The complex view of the IR system facilitates the
understanding that the [U.S.-Turkey relationship is shaped by the
feedback loops generated under]{.underline} both [regional and global
circumstances. The complexity of the international system can
trigger]{.underline} a dramatically [different evolution of relations
between U.S. and Turkey as a feedback (reaction]{.underline}) caused by
the U.S. For example, the U.S. does not hesitate to use methods like
arming the YPG, even if these methods hurt former allies such as Turkey.
As a result[, U.S.-Turkish relations continue to be vulnerable to the
U.S. approach toward]{.underline} minority, [rebel groups which have
problematic bonds with Turkey.]{.underline} The [international roles
that the U.S. and Turkey pursued]{.underline} for themselves in the
post-9/11 era have [had consequences for perceptions of]{.underline}
historical [friendship or hostilities]{.underline} -- what the Regional
Security Complex Theory ties to cooperative or non-cooperative behavior
of states. [There were hostility perceptions among Turkish]{.underline}
military and Foreign Service [chiefs in the wake of the collapse of the
Soviet Union]{.underline} when the U.S. sought to maintain its global
supremacy role. Given its resources, the [U.S. cannot help but be
superior to smaller,]{.underline} poorer [states that do not have
Washington's military capacity. The issue is the way]{.underline} in
which [the U.S. dominates]{.underline} -- that is, [its treatment of its
allies, not considering their strategic]{.underline} security
[concerns]{.underline}, etc. Turkey was deeply concerned with events in
northern Iraq following the 1991 Iraq war. These events amounted to
challenge Turkey's priority of preventing the emergence of an
independent Kurdish administration in northern Iraq. [The hostility
perceptions in Turkey turned to be reciprocal between the U.S. and
Turkey]{.underline} thanks to the feedback loops generated by the 9/11
attacks. The unilateral U.S. reaction to the 9/11 attacks during the
Bush administration undermined the U.S.-led liberal international order
and played no small role in the inauguration of Trump as a president who
questions this order and views local U.S. allies as burdens on the U.S.
[If we acknowledge that the complexity of the i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elations [system is at play]{.underline} here, the causal
logic of the [complexity approach leads us to expect that Turkey's
internal characteristics can pressure systemic
transformation]{.underline} -- something other than the predictions
generated by the regional security complex approach.83 [A U.S. that
operates with a systemic moral conscience could assist Turkey in
managing its affairs. Facing complexity **invokes improving diplomacy
and collaboration, adopting multilateral solutions**]{.underline} and
soft power **[and constructing]{.underline}** some [**advanced strategic
partnerships**. If the U.S. chooses to nurture its relationships with
allies such as Turkey, the erosion of the U.S.]{.underline} position of
[influence could be mitigated]{.underline} and the U.S. still could be
the primary actor in maintaining stability in the Middle East. The
underlying message of this paper is that [**the U.S. and Turkey are
rebuilding their alliance due to various factors.** Both **countries
could form a revised alliance as an important constituent of the
regional peace system.** Neither]{.underline} of them
[desire]{.underline}s the [continuation of the]{.underline} Syrian
[chaotic status-quo and its accompanying insecurity]{.underline} nor do
they desire Iran to dominate with a greater role in Syria or in the
Middle East. Clearly, [the security of the region is in]{.underline} a
state of greater [flux]{.underline} today than it has been in the past,
yet **[tackling the present challenges]{.underline}** in the Middle East
**[depends on the effective involvement of regional U.S.
partners.]{.underline}**

[The]{.underline} end [result of Turkey's tarnished ties with
its]{.underline} traditional [allies in the West]{.underline} and its
neighborhood(s) [have demonstrated the limits of the illusion of
Ankara's strategic autonomy.]{.underline} Indeed, despite its
aspiration, **[Turkey remains firmly anchored in the Western community
of nations.]{.underline}** In addition to being a NATO member, over 40
percent of [the country's exports are destined for EU member states
and]{.underline} another 6 percent or so each to [the UK
and]{.underline} the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. In
addition, [Turkey gets]{.underline} most of [its]{.underline} foreign
direct investment ([FDI) and tech]{.underline}nology [from Western
countries]{.underline}. EU member states account for almost 70 percent
of all incoming FDI, with another nearly 10 per- cent accounted by the
United States. Against this backdrop, the 2020 economic downturn,
compounded by a sharp drop in FDI, a negative foreign investment balance
sheet (excluding real estate), and a lowering of credit risk
scores---and, more recently, a spike in inflation and a downturn in the
value of the national currency---are to be associated with these frail
political relations. [The next phase of Turkey's foreign relations
paradigm will]{.underline} therefore [be marked **by how well the
country's growing capabilities**]{.underline}---but also its
ambitions---**[can be reframed to allow for]{.underline} a [more
cooperative foreign policy]{.underline}** pattern. [This]{.underline}
objective [will]{.underline} in turn [require three
fundamental]{.underline} [changes]{.underline}. [The first is the
decoupling of foreign policy from domestic political considerations. A
new balance will have to be found between the need for a democratic
government]{.underline} that is accountable to its electorate
[and]{.underline} the need for a more [mature]{.underline} and
predictable [foreign policy.]{.underline} This new understanding should
be instrumental in containing the proclivities of the ruling elites to
instrumentalize foreign policy for domestic goals. This objective will
be greatly facilitated by a [second]{.underline}, namely [the
reinstitutionalization of foreign policy.]{.underline} As discussed
above, [the transition back to a presidential system has led to the
erosion]{.underline} of the role [of traditional
institutions]{.underline} (e.g., ministries) in the policymaking
process---to the benefit of the presidential administration. This is
also true of foreign policy, where the role of the Foreign Ministry has
been diminished. [This]{.underline} domain [requires re- balancing,
which would reempower]{.underline} the [traditional]{.underline}
institution of [policymaking]{.underline}. Such [a rebalancing would
improve the predictability of Turkey's foreign policy]{.underline}, as
the heavier weight of the relevant institutions could more effectively
counter the tendencies fueled by exclusively domestic political
considerations. Third, [the country's foreign policy retransformation
will be more effective if Turkey's partners respond positively to
such]{.underline} an agenda of [change. The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and the EU---Turkey's strategic allies in the
domains of security, defense, and economy---[can help
Ankara]{.underline} in its bid to [develop a new understanding of how
Turkey]{.underline}, as a rising power, [can prioritize positive sum
scenarios]{.underline}. For instance, [**Washington will need to** alter
its approach and **start to engage constructively with the Turkish
leadership to tackle**]{.underline} the corrosive set of **[bilateral
problems,]{.underline}** including the ongoing U.S. relationship with
the PKK-linked Syrian PYD and the dysfunctionalities in defense industry

cease its obstructionism regarding the launch of an ambitious trade
agenda and endorse the start of the negotiations for a modernized
Customs Union between Turkey and the EU. [The outcome of new

Turkey as an awkward partner

[Despite the rift between Turkey and the West, Ankara's]{.underline}
Balkan [policy is neither disruptive nor entirely beholden to
neo-imperialist fantasies]{.underline}. [Rather it reflects a mixture of
ideology and pragmatic calculations and is often a **product of
circumstances** rather than grand designs]{.underline}. To start with,
[there is **no evidence** that Erdogan or the AKP are systematically
exporting authoritarian institutions and practices abroad, undermining
the West]{.underline}. Authoritarianism in the Balkans is a home-grown
phenomenon and not an import. In the 1990s, for instance, both Serbia
and Croatia saw the emergence of strongman regimes led respectively by
Slobodan Milošević and Franjo Tudjman. Such regimes combined democratic
and authoritarian elements, e.g. competitive elections in tandem with
state capture skewing the playing field, the propagation of illiberal
ideology and the suppression of minorities. It would be far-fetched to
fault Erdoğan, Putin, Viktor Orbán or anyone else about the rule of law
and accountability deficits in a region with historical experience with
competitive politics but is still a novice when it comes to democratic
governance. External powers may take advantage of state capture and
corruption, as they often do, but these are by and large local
conditions liable to be exploited (Bechev 2017; Bieber and Tzifakis
2019). Foreign meddling could well exacerbate matters -- e.g. Turkey's
partnership with or outright patronage over certain politicians and
factions in Bosnia and Herzegovina consolidates their grip on power and
public resources -- but is not the root cause of democratic
dysfunctionality. Secondly, [Turkey is not always the lone wolf it
appears to be]{.underline}. [A 'neo-Ottoman' policy would imply that
Turkey acts mostly unilaterally instead of through]{.underline}
institutions or alliances such as [NATO]{.underline}. To be sure,
Turkish foreign policy has a strong unilateralist impulse, as many
scholars and experts have pointed out. Self-reliance and distrust of
foreigners are entrenched in the Turkish public's perceptions and
attitudes (Aydın 2019). Ankara has made moves and asserted its interests
in the Balkans, such as providing economic assistance through TİKA),
supporting domestic political players aligned with the AKP, funding
schools, trying to mediate in regional disputes etc. The same was very
much true of the Middle East before the Arab Spring when Davutoğlu was
touting the notion of Turkey as an order-setter (düzen kurucu ülke)
(Davutoğlu 2001). At the same time, [even with President Erdoğan in
complete control and nationalism rampant, foreign policy has **played
along and adapted to multilateral institutions**]{.underline}. To give
the obvious example, despite its strained relationship with NATO and the
EU, Ankara continues to support their enlargement to the Balkans, as in
the AKP's early years of power. Rather than pursue an obstructionist
strategy, as does Russia, and try to wean countries into its diplomatic
orbit, it ratified without delay Montenegro and North Macedonia's NATO
accession treaty. There is no rhetorical or substantive opposition from
Ankara vis-à-vis the EU's expansion (Daily Sabah 2020). That makes sense
from a purely rational perspective. Bringing new members also means
expanded market access for Turkey thanks to the Customs Union with the
EU. Notably, Turkey is amongst the top five export markets for Romania,
Bulgaria and Greece, all members of the Union.7 In short, there still
remains a multilateral dimension to Turkey's engagement with the
Balkans, even if it gets overshadowed by Erdoğan's leader-to-leader
diplomacy (Büyük and Öztürk 2019). To sum up, despite the overarching
trends towards de-Europeanization affecting both Turkey and the Balkans,
there remains institutional ties and economic ties that bind them both
in the Western sphere. [This creates **space for Turkey and Western
actors** to join forces]{.underline} in the region [on an **ad hoc
basis**]{.underline}.

#### They aren't a terminal spoiler. There's room for cooperation.

**[Turkey]{.underline}** is embedded in the politics, economies and
societies of the Balkans. It is an autonomous player, and the cult of
Erdoğan has become central to its presence in the region, often with
divisive effects. However, [there **is no evidence** that its actions or
policies are geared at replacing the West as the lynchpin of regional
order]{.underline}. [Rather, Turkey is pursuing a **parallel policy**,
which at times overlaps with that of the EU, US and NATO]{.underline}.

### NATO-Turkey Coop Good\-\--AT S-400's

#### Turkey only bought S-400s from russia because there was no US agreement on modalities 

**Pamir et al 20**\-- Ahmet Üzümcü- Former Director-General of the OPCW,

the S-400 spat," European leadership network, 16 December 2020,
https://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/commentary/turkey-and-nato-resolving-the-s-400-spat/)//mcu

Bashing Turkey in international fora has become fashionable. [Some
suggest that Turkey is no longer a reliable]{.underline} or trustworthy
[member of NATO]{.underline}. Some go further, claiming that Turkey is a
liability, ignoring its history as a staunch ally. As former Turkish
Ambassadors to NATO, we believe that a healthy dose of reality should be
injected into this debate, which risks descending into a blame game in
which only NATO's opponents stand to gain. For the good of NATO and
Turkey we offer some constructive proposals and perspectives to restore
a sense of balance. First, we should seek to understand and resolve the
one issue overshadowing all else, the [Turkish purchase of Russian made
S-400 air defence systems]{.underline} and the U.S. decision to both
disengage Turkey from the F35 programme and to place some sanctions on
it. It should be remembered that [Turkey wanted to buy US air defence
systems but there was no agreement on the modalities]{.underline}.
Nevertheless, [this impasse in]{.underline} bilateral [relations between
Turkey and the U.S]{.underline}., and therefore within the Alliance,
[must and can be overcome with a modicum of give-and-take on both
sides]{.underline}. In our opinion, the issue of the Russian-made S-400s
could be satisfactorily resolved if Turkey makes a verifiable pledge
within NATO not to activate the system and the U.S. takes a decision in
parallel to reverse its position on the exclusion of Turkey from the F35
programme and on the recently imposed sanctions. Such conciliatory moves
should be complemented by a decision, backed by Alliance solidarity, to
enable Turkey to reach a deal on the joint production of a missile
defence system under a generous technology sharing agreement. We firmly
believe that such a compromise is achievable.

Ultimately, however, [fears of a **Turkish realignment** with Russia are
likely **overblown**. Moscow and Ankara's relations have
**historically** been **fraught**, and the recent rapprochement stems
more from **opportunism** and **coinciding interests** than a major
**reorientation** in Turkish foreign policy at the **expense** of its
**traditional alliances**]{.underline}. In fact, [Turkey's **forceful
posturing** is making it steadily more **at odds** with Russia in

in the **Caucasus**, for instance, has brought it **dangerously close**

**[Russia]{.underline}**, which supports Armenia under the Collective
Security Treaty Organization framework. This was highlighted by Russian
President Vladimir Putin's underscoring of Russia's "obligations to
Armenia." Though the violence ended there, Turkey's proxy saber-rattling
contributes to increase risks of accident or miscalculation leading to
armed confrontation with Russia --- something all parties are eager to
avoid. [With **antagonistic** security interests at stake, Turkey and
Russia are ultimately more likely to **balance** against **rather than

What does Turkey expect from its cooperation with Russia? First and
foremost, it has a bargaining chip to be used against its Western
partners. This type of flirtation threatens the alliance and forces the
NATO powers to support Turkey's agenda in Syria. However, [Turkey is
**aware** that **Russia** is an **unreliable partner** and that in the
**long-run** it is **no benefit** to be **outside NATO**]{.underline}.
That is why, for instance, [Ministry of Foreign Affairs declarations
**continue** to **stress** Turkey's **place in NATO** and why Turkey
**continues to support** its NATO allies' air strikes against Damascus.

In terms of alliance dependence, [Turkey would not put the **peace** and
**deterrence** provided by NATO at risk in a **volatile neighborhood**.
This approach includes **Russia-originated** threats]{.underline}.
Despite conjunctural cooperation between Turkey and Russia, the [chances
for a new strategic axis centered on the two countries is
**improbable**]{.underline}. Rather, [NATO is an **important asset** for
Turkey, even in **developing** its **relations** with Russia, as
membership **eases** the threat of **domination** by
Moscow]{.underline}. As a NATO member, [Turkey can rely on
**deterrence** that **discourages** regional adversaries from engaging
in a **full-scale** military campaign **against Turkey**.]{.underline}
This deterrence is no less important than having particular weapons,
such as S-400s. [NATO also supports **inter-alliance peace** between
Turkey and Greece, thereby sustaining a **delicate balance** to prevent
the Aegean dispute from turning into a **military
confrontation**]{.underline}. Turkey has a long-term policy of
participating in the international organizations that Greece joins in
order to maintain parity. [Leaving]{.underline} the most crucial one --
[NATO -- would put Turkey in the **difficult position** of confronting
the alliance **alone**]{.underline}. Lastly, [Turkey would not want to
give up the NATO **nuclear umbrella**, given that some of its neighbors
**possess** (Russia) or are striving for the capability of
**developing** (Iran) **nuclear weapons**.]{.underline}

#### Turkey won't leave

**Synergia** Foundation **19** (NATO AND TURKEY: AN IMMINENT DIVORCE?,
https://www.synergiafoundation.org/insights/analyses-assessments/nato-and-turkey-imminent-divorce)

Stung by the continued rejection of its EU membership on grounds of its
"poor human rights record", the authoritarian Erdogan just does not have
the incentive to toe NATO line.

Suspension of GSP benefits and increasing pressure from the Senate to
impose sanctions on Turkey under the Countering America's Adversaries
Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) will only widen the gap between Turkey
and NATO.

However, [Turkey is **unlikely to unilaterally opt out** of the alliance
because the alliance does have many benefits apart from the prestige of
being a member of NATO]{.underline}.

Hardening of the Turkish stand will impinge on conflict resolution in
Syria where Turkish national goals are at a tangent to Western plans.
Here, Turkey may leverage Russia to checkmate US and its allies.

#### Turkey won't leave NATO or respond to the plan

MOSCOW, May 30. /TASS/. [[Turkey]{.mark} will continue to pursue an
independent military policy, **but [will]{.mark} [refrain from
\"challenging]{.mark}\" the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [or
quitting]{.mark} the [North Atlantic alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline},
the head of the Russian International Affairs Council, Andrey Kortunov,
told TASS on Monday. \"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, while
being a full-fledged member of the North Atlantic Alliance, pursues an
independent, externally unrestrained military policy. The way I see it,
he will continue like this this further on,\" Kortunov said.
[Erdogan]{.underline} \"firmly defends his interests, for he **[is well
aware that [Turkey will not be expelled from NATO]{.mark}, while [he
will not leave on his own]{.mark},\"]{.underline}** the analyst said. At
the same time, Kortunov predicts Ankara's conflicts with NATO. \"There
will be harsh statements and threats from both sides, **[but I don\'t
think it will come to Turkey\'s withdrawal or [expulsion from
NATO]{.mark}. It [would cost both sides too
much.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}** Turkey's interests **[[Without
Turkey]{.mark}, Kortunov explained, \"[NATO\'s southern flank will
lose]{.mark} a lot, if not [everything]{.mark},\"]{.underline}**
**[since [the country is the bloc's leading
member]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and its armed forces are inferior only to
those of the US.]{.underline} For this reason, he continued, [the
Turkish leadership will]{.underline} be pressing for concessions from
the US and EU countries, \"but it will [never challenge
them]{.underline}.\" Erdogan has a whole list of complaints against the
United States, Kortunov recalled. For instance, Turkey wants the lifting
sanctions related to its purchase of Russia's S-400 air defense systems
and its return to the US F-35 fighter program. \"There is as great deal
to bargain about. Clearly, Erdogan will not get everything, but he will
be able to get something in the end,\" he believes. The expert also
suggested that the Turkish side might be able to defend its interests on
the issue of Finland and Sweden joining NATO. For one, the Turkish
leadership wants these countries to curtail their traditional support
for the Kurdish opposition. \"I think they will eventually come to an
agreement. Here, concessions are expected not only from Stockholm, but
also from Brussels,\" Kortunov explained. While commenting on the
Turkish leader\'s contacts with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the
expert noted: \"In the alliance, no one would want Erdogan to play his
own game with Moscow behind its back. But it be impossible to prevent
it, so they will have to leave everything as it is.\" The analyst
stressed that Turkey had long had a very special relationship with the
North Atlantic Alliance and declared certain interests that often do not
coincide with the stance of other NATO members. The Turkish leadership,
Kortunov forecasts, will continue to pursue a policy that, in a sense,
might violate the unity of the bloc. \"However, in this regard, [Erdogan
will go as far as he will be allowed to,\"]{.underline} he stressed.
\"He will be declaring his special interests in Libya or the Eastern
Mediterranean, he will put himself in opposition to some European
countries, or position himself as a global advocate of Islam, but **[[I
don\'t think he will go to extremes]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}**

### Expulsion Bad\-\--L-List

#### Turkish inclusion into NATO solves [Russia]{.underline}, [Middle Eastern]{.underline} and [Caucasus]{.underline} war

**Hess 6-22**-2022, Central Asia fellow at the Foreign Policy Research
Institute (Maximillian, "Why the West Should Make Peace With Erdogan
Now: He is the one unsavory character the West urgently needs better
relations with.," Foreign Policy,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/06/22/turkey-erdogan-ukraine-russia-war-west-us-geopolitics-black-sea-europe-energy/?tpcc=recirc_latest062921)//BB>

[The democratic West has a long and controversial history of entering
alliances of convenience with dictators and strongmen around the
world]{.underline}---unsavory but necessary partners in confronting
threats to the international order. Denounced as ethically dubious, this
sort of stance is also realist, balance-of-power politics par
excellence. It enabled the world to unite to defeat Adolf Hitler in
World War II and the West to win the Cold War. [Atop the list of
unsavory partners the West urgently **needs better relations with**
today sits]{.underline} Turkish President Recep Tayyip
[Erdogan]{.underline}. That he is unsavory is clear: He has actively
undermined Turkish democracy, undone decades of liberalization,
weaponized migration, terrorized the Kurdish minority both at home and
in neighboring Syria, and helped Iran violate U.S. sanctions. Most
recently, he has threatened to block NATO membership for Sweden and
Finland. It will take a long time before the West can genuinely trust
him. However, the reality is that [the West needs Erdogan more than
ever]{.underline}. [Russia's brutal, all-out war against Ukraine has
vastly raised Turkey's profile on the geostrategic
chessboard]{.underline}. [Ankara has emerged as a key supplier of drones
to Kyiv]{.underline}---shipments it has luckily shown no intention of
halting. Ukraine's chances of victory would be significantly improved if
Turkish arms deliveries were expanded. [Erdogan, who controls access to
the Black Sea through the Turkish Straits, crucially shut the passage to
warships in late February]{.underline}. At the same time, Ankara has
also been willing to cooperate with Moscow on Ukraine where Erdogan sees
an opportunity. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu discussed
plans to secure a route for Ukrainian grain exports with his Russian
counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in Ankara on June 8, reportedly asking for a
25 percent discount on Turkish grain purchases as part of the deal.
Without Ankara on board, any Western proposals to break the Russian
blockade of Ukrainian ports are dead on arrival. [The West also needs
Turkey on its side in the economic war against Russia]{.underline}.
[Ankara's support alone can restrict the flow of sanctioned Russian
goods in and out of the Black Sea, which continue even as Ukrainian
ships are stuck in port]{.underline}. [Ankara's help is crucial in
cutting ratlines for Russian money and kleptocrats]{.underline}. Turkey
has become a major destination for Russian money (and oligarchs' yachts)
fleeing sanctions and plays a growing role in supporting Russian
President Vladimir Putin's new autarkic economy. Turkey is one of the
few major countries that freely accept Russian payment, undercutting the
impact of Western banking sanctions. Bringing Turkey onboard would plug
one of the largest holes in the sanctions regime. Russia's brutal,
all-out war against Ukraine has vastly raised Turkey's profile on the
geostrategic chessboard. But most importantly, [Turkey will be a key
player in the reordering of European energy supplies]{.underline}, not
least because it controls energy access through a number of crucial
pipelines. The key to Europe's Southern Gas Corridor strategy, for
example, is gas from Azerbaijan supplied via Turkey's Trans-Anatolian
and Trans-Adriatic pipelines---inaugurated in 2018 and 2020,
respectively---and feeding into the European gas grid in the Balkans and
Italy. Erdogan is also actively seeking to develop Turkey's own gas
resources and potentially even link Israeli and Cypriot offshore gas
fields to the European pipeline network. Such efforts are of course
complicated by Greco-Turkish disputes over Cyprus and its surrounding
waters. A revived European-Turkish partnership may be the only way the
Eastern Mediterranean's rich energy resources can be fully utilized.
Such a partnership might also nudge Erdogan to make an about-face
vis-à-vis Russia, where the inauguration of the TurkStream pipeline in
2020 signaled a new high point in Turkish-Russian relations. Finally,
[aligning with Erdogan would offer the West more geostrategic leverage
over the Kremlin beyond the war in Ukraine]{.underline}. [Turkey is also
a key player in]{.underline} three additional conflicts where Russia is
involved: **[Syria]{.underline}**, **[Libya]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan over
**[Nagorno-Karabakh]{.underline}**. Erdogan moved from a policy of
benign neglect to active intervention in these conflicts over the past
decade, motivated by a desire to boost Turkey's role as a regional power
independent of the West. A resumed partnership with Erdogan offers
further pressure points in the effort to constrain Moscow's global
influence. For Erdogan's drift away from the West and closer relations
with Moscow to be reversed, it is important to understand what motivated
it. Today, the West is paying a price for failing to listen to his
concerns. The drift initially began in 2011, as the Arab Spring swept
across North Africa and the Middle East. Erdogan was ebullient, as the
uprisings offered the prospect of bringing Islamists similar to himself
to power across the region. He felt betrayed when then-U.S. President
Barack Obama failed to uphold his redlines in Syria and abandoned
then-Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, affiliated with the Muslim
Brotherhood and publicly backed by Erdogan, when the Egyptian military
ousted Morsi in a coup. "Turkey has learned the hard way that the U.S.
is unwilling to invest in the region," Muhammet Kocak, an international
relations specialist based in Ankara, told me. Similarly, "Turkey's
security concerns have not been perceived as a particularly relevant
issue in the NATO agenda," said Elizabete Aunina, a doctoral researcher
at the University of Amsterdam focused on Turkish security policy. But
what accelerated Erdogan's drift away from the West---and shift to
Moscow---was his sense of betrayal after the 2016 failed Turkish coup,
which he publicly accused the United States of fostering. He also felt
abandoned by his NATO allies when Washington withdrew its Patriot
missile defense systems from Turkey and when NATO barely even reacted
after Turkey shot down a Russian fighter aircraft intruding on its
airspace, the first such incident involving NATO and Russian or Soviet
airpower in 60 years. Since then, Erdogan felt that Moscow offered a
better route to improving his regional and domestic position.
Turkish-Russian cooperation since then includes the TurkStream pipeline,
plans for Russia to build a \$20 billion nuclear power plant in Turkey,
and the 2017 announcement that Ankara would buy Moscow's S-400 missile
defense system. And although Turkey and Russia have occasionally
sparred---they back differing sides in the Syrian and Libyan civil wars,
for example---relations have remained broadly warm and manageable. That
only increases the potential strategic leverage the West would gain if
it reversed Erdogan's orientation. What carrot could the West offer
Erdogan for abandoning Moscow? Turkey's economic crisis may be just the
opportunity. With annual inflation reaching 73.5 percent in May,
currency reserves near all-time lows, and the Turkish lira down by 30
percent versus the dollar year-to-date following a 44 percent drop in
2021, Turkey's risk of default has spiked. Foreign investors have fled
the market. Desperately searching for fresh foreign capital, Erdogan
even patched up relations with his key regional rival, Saudi Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It would be better for the West to offer
Erdogan an economic lifeline than to allow Moscow to do so. The U.S.
Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, for example, should consider
offering Erdogan a currency swap line, a stabilizing instrument they
have significantly expanded in recent decades. Access to dollars and
euros could alleviate many of Ankara's mounting economic challenges and
set the stage for a more cooperative partnership. Erdogan knows he has a
strong hand and is likely to make other demands. He has already exerted
his leverage over Sweden's and Finland's desired accession to NATO,
linking it to a freer hand for Turkey against the Syrian Kurds, who have
been the West's valiant allies in the fight against the Islamic State.
Earlier this month, Erdogan announced plans for a new operation
targeting them. He may well make demands about other regional interests,
and he will certainly seek to blunt Western criticism of his domestic
governance. These concessions could prove costly to other Western
interests. There is clear hesitancy to engage Erdogan at the moment. The
West's strategy appears to be to "count on the possibility Erdogan will
lose the \[June 2023\] elections," according to Kocak. Counting on
Erdogan to allow a free and fair election and a potential peaceful
transfer of power a year from now is idealistic at best and hopelessly
naive at worst. [Erdogan is an unsavory character and will likely remain
one. But it is in the West's interest that he be on its side---not
Russia's---in order to **weaken Putin** and **ensure Ukraine's
survival**]{.underline}. The opportunity is there, and it would be
unwise of the West not to try.

Some analysts evaluate Turkey as among the most militarily powerful
nations, ranking ninth among 137 military powers worldwide.

Do we really want to [kick Turkey out of NATO and have its **military
power** and **strategic geography** aligned with Russia]{.underline}?

Geographically, [Turkey occupies]{.underline} some of the
[most]{.underline} strategically [important **territory** in the
wor]{.underline}ld. [It is the **only NATO member** state in the Middle
East]{.underline}, [bordering **Syria** and **Iraq**]{.underline}, [near
Lebanon and **Israel**]{.underline}, a region that has been --- and
continues to be --- the crucial crossroads of empire and history since
biblical times. [Turkey controls]{.underline} the [Bosporus Straits,
Marmara Sea and Dardanelles Straits between]{.underline} the [**Black
Sea** and]{.underline} the [Mediterranean]{.underline},
[giving]{.underline} it the [capability to contain **Russia's** powerful
**Black Sea Fleet**]{.underline}. [Turkey's geographic location and
strong military makes it]{.underline} the [**anchor** of NATO's
**southern flank** against **Russian aggression**]{.underline}.

Turkey also is an unsinkable aircraft carrier, with 98 airports capable
of supporting NATO air operations over the Middle East, Black Sea and
the Balkans.

It is [one of only five NATO states]{.underline} (the others being
Germany, Italy, Belgium and The Netherlands) [storing U.S. **tactical
nuclear weapons**]{.underline} on its territory. Some 50 B-61 nuclear
bombs are bunkered at Incirlik Air Force Base, controlled by U.S.
personnel stationed there.

Washington's foreign policy elites are so fixated on recent Kurdish
contributions to defeating the Islamic State (ISIS) that they seem to
have forgotten Turkey's much longer record as an ally of the U.S. and
NATO:

- Turkey fought alongside the U.S. during the Korean War (1950-1953).

- During the early Cold War, Turkey agreed to basing U.S. nuclear
  bombers and IRBMs on its territory, making Turkey a nuclear target for
  the USSR. (President Kennedy was able to avoid nuclear war with the
  Soviet Union and resolve the October 1962 Cuban missile crisis by
  secretly promising Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to remove the U.S.
  IRBMs.)

- Turkey joined the U.S. and NATO in bombing Bosnia during Operation
  Deliberate Force (1995).

- Turkey joined the U.S. and NATO in bombing Serbia during Operation
  Allied Force (1999).

- Turkey participated in Baltic Sea air patrols demonstrating support
  for the NATO Baltic states (2006).

- For years and continuing today, Turkish forces have participated in
  NATO peacekeeping in Bosnia and Kosovo.

- Turkey provided military and intelligence support to U.S. operations
  that destroyed the ISIS terrorist "caliphate."

[Turkey's **membership**]{.underline} in NATO [quelled]{.underline} the
[**long cycle of conflicts** and wars with Greece]{.underline}, [also a
**NATO member**]{.underline}. Significantly, even Turkey's controversial
invasion of Cyprus in 1974 did not trigger a war with Greece, in no
small part because both are NATO members.

Unfortunately, Turkey under President Erdogan is abandoning secularism
and democratic norms, becoming an Islamist authoritarian state, and
pulling away from the U.S. and NATO. Indeed, Erdogan is beginning to
align Turkey with Russia, buying Russian military equipment over U.S.
objections.

Erdogan even has threatened to develop nuclear weapons, which justifies
withdrawing U.S. tactical nuclear weapons from Turkey. Yet Turkey,
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel and other Middle East allies all have
legitimate fear of Iran developing nuclear missiles, so threatened
nuclear proliferation by Turkey and others may be a sign of U.S. failure
to uphold its alliance obligations through credible extended nuclear
deterrence and other means.

[Turkey controls]{.underline} the [**flow** of Middle Eastern
**refugees** into European NATO]{.underline}, a [**crucial role**
whereby]{.underline} a [friendly Turkey can]{.underline} help
[**stabilize** its neighbors]{.underline} --- [or]{.underline} an
[unfriendly Turkey could unleash]{.underline} a [**human flood** into
Europe]{.underline}.

Israel, too, will be better served if Turkey remains in NATO and, thus,
a moderating influence on Islamist Erdogan, who eventually may be
replaced by a secular leader. Imagine the threat to U.S. and Israeli
interests if Turkey leaves NATO and becomes another Islamist rogue state
like Iran.

Turkey's withdrawal from NATO may, or may not, be historically
inevitable. But the United States should do everything possible to keep
such a valuable ally in NATO and prevent Turkey from becoming a
dangerous foe.

### Expulsion Bad\-\--NATO

#### NATO needs turkey---acts as a peace bridge to the middle east, Muslim majority, and decisive ally versu China and Russia

Just as Turkey derives immense benefits from NATO membership, the
alliance in general and the United States in particular also benefit
from Turkey\'s membership. First, since its entry to the alliance
[Turkey]{.underline} has [playe]{.underline}d [a key role in European
security by shielding the continent from the east and the south. Turkey
does not only act as a buffer zone]{.underline} insulating the Kantian
Europe from the Hobbesian Middle East [but also as a spearhead enabling
NATO allies to reach out to the Caucasus, Black Sea, Central Asia and
wider Middle East]{.underline}. During the Cold War Turkey acted as a
bulwark against Soviet penetration into the wider Middle East and helped
lessen the Soviet military pressure on central Europe by tying up
sizable Soviet troops. [Turkey\'s role as an unsinkable aircraft carrier
has been well noted.]{.underline} Second, [Turkey is the only ally
within NATO which has a Muslim-majority population.]{.underline}
Turkey\'s [membership serves as an antidote to the claims that NATO is
an alliance of Christian nations.]{.underline} This has
[become]{.underline} more and more [important in the
post-9/11]{.underline} era, as civilizational and identity-related
considerations have increasingly colored international politics. [For
NATO\'s military operations across the globe not to be seen as biased
against Islamic nations, Turkey\'s presence inside]{.underline} the
alliance [has been vital]{.underline}ly important. Third,
[if]{.underline} the [Biden]{.underline} administration [is sincere
about revitalizing the]{.underline} rules-based [international order and
committed to strengthening NATO]{.underline} as a bulwark [against
Russia and China]{.underline}, securing [Turkey's cooperation within
NATO would be decisive]{.underline}. Turkey is too important an ally to
lose to the Russian-Chinese axis. Fourth, as NATO\'s current Secretary
General has underlined many times, [Turkey\'s cooperation within NATO
has been vital to the defeat of radical religious terrorism in the wider
Middle East]{.underline}. Besides, [Turkey is home to millions of
refugees]{.underline} who would like to otherwise go to European
countries. Fifth, having [the second largest army within the alliance
and participated in almost all NATO military operations to date, Turkey
has decisively contributed to NATO\'s overall military
capabilities.]{.underline} Turkey\'s [participation in]{.underline}
multinational NATO operations in [Afghanistan]{.underline} and taking
command of it numerous times [speak volumes]{.underline} in this regard.
[Turkey hosting the upcoming negotiations between the Afghan government
and Taliban could potentially facilitate the peace process]{.underline}.
Sixth, [Turkey\'s membership]{.underline} in NATO [provides western
countries with]{.underline} important opportunities to have an
[influence on Turkey\'s international]{.underline} [and internal
policies/orientation]{.underline} as well. Why to lose this prerogative
by pushing Turkey further away from the alliance? All in all, both
Turkey and NATO allies gain from Turkey's membership. Unless NATO turns
out to become an ideological weapon at the hands of the liberal hawkish
cabals in the West, Turkey would feel quite comfortable within the
alliance.

While [NATO may ultimately be able to expel Turkey, it would not be in
NATO's best interest]{.underline} to do so. First, the [[expulsion of
Turkey]{.mark} could [lead to increased antagonism between Turkey and
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Second, [the loss of Turkey's
military contributions would be a significant loss to the
alliance.]{.underline} Turkey's 1974 invasion of Cyprus placed it in
conflict with fellow NATO member Greece.\[23\] While NATO membership did
not prevent the conflict, in part because Cyprus was not a member of
NATO, Cyprus has maintained an uneasy peace since the invasion, managing
to accede to the European Union in May of 2004.\[24\] [An unaligned
Turkey may be more likely to disrupt the peace in Cyprus,]{.underline}
which is not a NATO member and may not be defended by the international
community. The preserved peace in Cyprus, and the value of the NATO
forum for preserving that peace, may be instructive for influencing
potential future actions by Turkey. While [the results of Turkey's
incursion into Kurdish]{.underline} controlled parts of [Syria
are]{.underline} currently [unknown, [NATO is more likely to influence
Turkey as a member than a non-member]{.mark} potentially [allied with
Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline} Additionally, [a loss of Turkey's military
contributions to NATO would significantly weaken the
alliance]{.underline}. [Turkey's [Incirlik]{.mark} Air [Base serves a
critical role]{.mark} in NATO operations]{.underline}. At the peak of
the fighting, missions from the base dropped an average of 180 bombs per
day.\[25\] [[Turkey is the geographically nearest]{.mark} member [to
Syria]{.mark} and [Russia]{.mark}, as well as the conflicts in [Iraq and
Afghanistan]{.mark}]{.underline}[,\[]{.mark}26\] [and a loss of the base
would hamper NATO operations in the region]{.underline}. NATO has
invested over \$5,000,000,000 on infrastructure in Turkey.\[27\] The
importance of Incirlik Air Base to NATO was affirmed by the inclusion of
\$48,000,000 for its improvement in the National Defense Authorization
Act for the fiscal year 2018.\[28\] In addition to its strategically
vital location, Turkey's military contributions to the alliance would be
missed. [[Turkey has the second-largest military]{.mark} in NATO, larger
than the third and fourth largest militaries
combined]{.underline},\[29\] [as well as the seventh-highest defense
expenditures]{.underline}.\[30\] [Turkey has been part of the NATO
mission in Afghanistan since 2001 and may have advantages in peace
brokering due to shared Islamic religion]{.underline}.\[31\] [[There are
clear benefits to maintaining Turkey's membership]{.mark} and this
course of action has advocates]{.underline}.\[32\] However, the question
of membership may not matter. The United States is considering removing
nuclear weapons from Turkey .\[33\] This would signal that NATO does not
trust Turkey, making it a member in name only, and one unaligned with
the rest of NATO, making the question of membership strategically
irrelevant.

#### Nukes in İncirlik are key to NATO nuclear defense

İncirlik's place on NATO's nuclear deterrence In other words, when Biden
was entering the presidential run of 2020, he started out stating his
discomfort regarding the nuclear weapons in Turkey. The person who has
expressed such worry is currently sitting at the White House. Can these
statements of Biden reflect on the policies he will follow during his
presidency? Let's try to answer this question by examining the moves
Biden has made on foreign policy. Biden sees strengthening transatlantic
ties, that is, relations between the U.S. and Europe, and institutional
cooperation structures as one of his primary foreign policy goals. In
this context, NATO appears as the most strategic institution for the
U.S. president. [His strategy against Russia]{.underline}, which NATO
continues to see as the main threat[, is to protect nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}, as reflected in all relevant documents of the
alliance. In this context, we can remember the decisions of the NATO
summit in Brussels in 2018. According to these, [NATO's nuclear
deterrence is based on "the nuclear weapons deployed by the U.S. in the
allied countries in Europe and the capabilities and infrastructure
provided by the relevant allied countries]{.underline}" - as well as the
contributions of the U.S. strategic forces and the U.K. and France. [One
of the "relevant allied countries" is Turkey]{.underline}. Without a
doubt, [İncirlik has a very essential place in the infrastructure
provided to the U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe.]{.underline} By allowing
the possession of U.S. nuclear weapons in İncirlik and becoming the host
to these weapons, [Turkey has assumed a significant role in NATO's
nuclear deterrence.]{.underline} In this respect[, İncirlik forms one of
the most critical pillars of NATO's nuclear umbrella under current
conditions.]{.underline} Of course, [the proximity of this base to not
only Russia but also to the Middle East is undoubtedly a factor that
needs to be taken into account.]{.underline} Biden will continue the old
policy but... Given that [İncirlik is so heavily integrated into NATO's
nuclear planning, it seems unrealistic to expect Biden's
sentiment]{.underline} in his interview with New York Times to [be
reflected in the U.S. official policy]{.underline} - unless there arises
a major policy change. Next month, the NATO summit in Brussels, where
[Erdoğan and Biden will meet face to face for the first time in the new
period, will probably be finalized with a result that will emphasize
NATO's nuclear deterrence policy once again]{.underline}. Nevertheless,
if the Turkish-U.S. relations do not enter a period of recovery and
continue to be the scene of crises as they are today, the possibility of
further strengthening of the questioning view of the U.S. press, opinion
leaders and the U.S. public opinion regarding the nuclear inventory in
İncirlik should not be underestimated.

[maintaining the **credibility** of the commitment of alliance members

#### Regional arms racing and nuclear war

Adam **Garfinkle 18,** Founding Editor of The American Interest and a
Senior Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, "The
U.S.-Turkish Unraveling and the Arabs", American Interest, 09-03-2018,
https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/09/03/the-u-s-turkish-unraveling-and-the-arabs///SJ

Now, the [logic of the security dilemma is]{.underline} such [that
in]{.underline} the [absence of the credible U.S. provision of
**extended deterrence**]{.underline}, [Turkey would feel **pressure** to
develop its own nuclear weapons]{.underline}. [That it has not exerted
itself in that direction]{.underline}, despite its formidable
engineering and scientific capacities, [illustrates]{.underline} the
[**stability** of **Turkish trust in U.S**.
protection]{.underline}---until recently---[and]{.underline} the
[ability]{.underline} of both sides [to bracket]{.underline} the **[core
security relationship]{.underline}** away from various disagreements. As
with other nuclear-armed states, should Turkey go its own way it would
do so with no active intention of actually using such weapons, but
rather as a kind of insurance policy against diplomatic extortion at the
hands of other nuclear-armed powers.

But of course [if Turkey]{.underline}, no longer tethered to U.S.
security protection in one way or another, [developed nuclear
weapons]{.underline} for such a purpose, [other **regional states**
would]{.underline} probably [feel obliged to develop or]{.underline}
otherwise [acquire their own weapons]{.underline}, if they could, [as an
insurance policy]{.underline} against nuclear extortion by Turkey.3 They
have already practiced that way of thinking in reaction to the
possibility of an Iranian nuclear breakout, of course.

Indeed, [that]{.underline} kind of [hedging]{.underline} behavior
[is]{.underline} exactly [what]{.underline} analysts have discussed for
many years now [as the so-called **N+ danger** inherent]{.underline} in
the development of Iranian nuclear weapons. It is not just the danger
posed by Iranian nuclear weapons, bad enough as that would be, but the
[mousetrap effect of proliferation]{.underline} that [would likely drive
**other states** to want]{.underline} such an **[insurance
policy]{.underline}**: [Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Algeria, and so
on]{.underline}.

Now, some observers have argued that nuclear weapons are really not very
important after all. If the United States and the Soviet Union, as well
as China, France, and the United Kingdom, survived the Cold War without
any nuclear use, it must be because deterrence is easy and hence stable,
since all rational people know that the weapons are unusable save for
the since-become-impossible exception of a state holding a monopoly over
them. One well-known scholar, Kenneth Waltz, argued persistently that
the more nuclear the weapons the better---because they would sober
everyone up and lead to more stability and fewer wars. Happily, those
with actual government responsibility did not agree.

It is unspeakably lazy thinking to glibly superimpose the U.S.-Soviet
Cold War deterrence experience onto places like the Middle East. [It
is]{.underline}, after all, [one thing to maintain stable deterrence
when there are only two]{.underline}, or a small number of, [nuclear
powers]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} quite [another to maintain stable
deterrence when]{.underline} the [number of nuclear actors gets
**larger** and becomes]{.underline} somewhat [**open-ended** as more
states lean that way]{.underline}. Under such conditions
[it]{.underline} [becomes **much more difficult** to calculate what
a]{.underline} sufficient **[deterrent]{.underline}** is, and so efforts
to make sure of having "enough" can touch off a multilateral arms
competition in which sufficiency becomes an ever-moving target, almost
impossible to hit. At the same time [it becomes much more difficult to
imagine **crisis stability** if one or more states resort to
**launch-on-warning**]{.underline} deployment postures, which are more
likely when young arsenals are small and unprotectable against
preemptive attack.

Other important potential differences between U.S.-Soviet Cold War
deterrence and potential multiparty deterrence in the Middle East exist,
too. Let us note just three.

First, [U.S. and Soviet arsenals displayed clear lines of civil-military
authority]{.underline} in highly institutionalized state systems, but
many [Middle Eastern countries lack]{.underline} both such [**clear
lines of authority** and]{.underline} highly [**institutionalized**
arrangements]{.underline}, being instead looser and more personalized by
nature.

Second, it was taken for granted that both [U.S. and Soviet]{.underline}
leaderships [cared about]{.underline} the [safety of their
populations]{.underline}, a necessary assumption for effective
deterrence. But [in]{.underline} some heterogeneous and [authoritarian
Middle Eastern countries]{.underline} this [premise may not]{.underline}
so surely [apply]{.underline}---think both Iraq and Syria under
minoritarian (and coincidentally Ba'athi) leadership, both of which
committed mass murder against its own citizens.

And third, [U.S.-Soviet deterrence]{.underline} operations
[became]{.underline} inextricably [bound up]{.underline} in the minds of
observers [with intercontinental ballistic missile]{.underline} delivery
systems. The result is that some people today think that if missiles can
be limited in one way or another, then the dangers of nuclear weapons,
even if they come to exist, would be much mitigated. This is delusional
because it is technologically obtuse. You need intercontinental
ballistic missiles if you're trying to shoot a warhead across an ocean.
But [if your enemy target is not across an ocean]{.underline}, but, as
in the Middle East, quite nearby, [airplanes are immensely **less
expensive** and **more reliable** as delivery systems]{.underline}.

The basic point is that in both theory and practice, [there is little
difference between]{.underline} the [proliferation stimulating effects
of]{.underline} a [Turkish nuclear weapons **breakout** and]{.underline}
an [**Iranian** one]{.underline}. So [if]{.underline} the
[U.S.-Turkish]{.underline} strategic [partnership unravels]{.underline},
[logic]{.underline} does indeed [suggest a Turkish effort to
develop]{.underline} its **[own nuclear capabilities]{.underline}**. (Of
course, the same kinds of pressures pertain to other key countries were
they to lose, one way or another, their U.S. nuclear umbrellas,
including Germany, Japan, South Korea, and others.)

If that happens, the [Turkish government]{.underline} could probably
[develop deliverable]{.underline} nuclear **[warheads]{.underline}** at
least on its side of the ocean [within]{.underline} two to three
[years]{.underline}. [If]{.underline} the [Iranian
government]{.underline} had [thought]{.underline} for its own good
reasons [to avoid overt testing]{.underline} and breakout postures once
the nuclear deal expires by calendar or "is expired" by volition, a
[Turkish bomb would make that posture far **more difficult** to
justify]{.underline}. One could therefore imagine a situation of twinned
or near-simultaneous breakouts of Turkish and Iranian nuclear weapons
even a mere three, four, or five years from now. The [shock to the
region would be **profound**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} possibly
very **[dangerous]{.underline}**.

[[A
recent [article](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/turkey-secretly-working-nuclear-weapons-13898)]{.mark} in
the National Interest]{.underline} by Hans Rühle, former Head of the
Planning Staff in the German Ministry of Defense, [[argues that Turkey
is positioning itself similarly to Iran in]{.mark} its leveraging of
civilian nuclear power for potential [nuclear weapons breakout
capability]{.mark}]{.underline}. His argument, meant largely to justify
German spying on the NATO-ally, posits that since Turkey is developing
nuclear power plants, potentially developing its own nuclear fuel
production capacity, and does not have a provision for spent nuclear
fuel to be return to suppliers (a provision not necessary if producing
fuel domestically), it is obviously shadowing the Iranian proliferation
formula. [[These arguments are]{.mark} significantly
[flawed]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the Turkish movement into the
nuclear arena could be afforded more clarity, particularly on the heels
of a decade of efforts to corral the Iranian program, nefarious purposes
should not be assumed; nor, are they immediately apparent. Rühle argues
that the size of the nuclear industry that Turkey is planning, as well
as the amount of fuel that would be needed to supply that industry,
would provide ample material for a nuclear weapon. From a purely
technical perspective, nuclear fuel from most civilian power reactors is
not ideal for a weapons program. Turkey plans to construct four
light-water pressurized reactors. These light-water reactors make
breeding the type of plutonium necessary for nuclear weapons difficult
-- as purity is key in having a safe and reliable arsenal. Rühle
dismisses the point that the less-pure plutonium from a civilian power
reactor would not be used for military program. Rather, Ruhle argues
that regardless of plutonium purity, a state will seek to acquire any
form of nuclear material and use it for a nuclear arsenal. However, the
quality of plutonium is a critical factor in understanding and
forecasting proliferation strategies. Not all plutonium is created
equal. Having impure plutonium in a nuclear arsenal, an arsenal that a
nation would use to deter attack by other states, would be extremely
dangerous. When uranium (particularly civilian reactor-grade uranium) is
used in a power reactor, plutonium-239, the fissile material used for
the production of nuclear weapons, is created. However, other
by-products and isotopes of plutonium are also generated. The ratio of
these by-products depends on the type of fuel you start with and how
long the fuel is used in a power reactor. The longer it is in there, the
less pure the plutonium output. While Rühle dismisses this point, other
isotopes of plutonium which would be created in the civilian power
reactor would be dangerous in a nuclear arsenal, particularly Pu-240 due
to its unstable neutron flux which makes the long-term viability of the
warhead questionable. With a quicker decay rate than Pu-239, comes the
potential for spontaneously released neutrons -- which is what starts
the chain reaction to detonation. In the short-term, this is less of an
issue, but the risk of unintended detonation increases over time. For a
state that wishes to have a nuclear arsenal that will be able to deter
the use or proliferation of nuclear weapons, a stable arsenal is
critical for reliable use if necessary and for the warheads not to
detonate on your own territory. The type of reactor that is used is also
important. The reactor models that Turkey plans to build make hiding
illicit activities, such as diverting material, difficult. Reloading the
fuel in the models being sought halts reactor operations and would stop
operations for days or weeks at time. Turkey desperately needs energy.
It imports roughly [90% of its oil and natural gas, and is heavily
reliant on
coal](https://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis_includes/countries_long/Turkey/turkey.pdf).
Domestic energy production, particularly electricity, is lacking.
Expanding its energy capacity is critical to Turkey's economic
development strategy. Shuttering a nuclear reactor for weeks or months
at a time in order to extract costly fuel does not align with this
policy objective. Further, plans for a nuclear energy sector of two
dozen or so power reactors, with contracts in place already for eight,
points to a desperate need for energy, not a mask for illicit
activities. There are also significant differences in Iran and Turkey's
nuclear sectors. Iran purchased one power facility, Bushehr, from
Russia, and then justified its expansion of uranium enrichment by the
need for medical isotopes. This justification enabled Iran to enrich up
to 20% U-235, which accounts for roughly 80% of the work load to get to
weapons-grade material. In terms of breakout capacity, this strategy is
designed to conduct enrichment in the open, and then quickly escalate to
weapons-grade. Turkey, on the other hand, is justifying its nuclear
expansion for economic reasons, driven by shortages in energy.
Additionally, recent studies have found that a [lucrative market for
mining and fuel
production](https://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-T-Z/Turkey/)
could be developed in Turkey. With developing nuclear energy sectors in
number of countries (China, Vietnam, UAE, etc.), uranium ore and fuel
services will likely be in greater demand. Again, the economic
motivations appear to outweigh the security explanations. Furthermore,
the International Atomic Energy Agency would also have greater access in
Turkey than it did in Iran in the early years of the Iranian program.
Currently, Turkey is a member in good standing and a signatory to the
[Additional
Protocol](https://www.iaea.org/safeguards/safeguards-legal-framework/additional-protocol)
(AP). The current safeguards regime in Turkey, which includes the
advanced monitoring and access that comes from the AP, requires early
notification and cooperation with the IAEA as sites that deal with
nuclear energy are developed. This access is well beyond what Iran was
subjected to during the early stages of its program. As Turkey expands
into nuclear energy, be it mining and milling or energy production,
under the current safeguards regime, the IAEA would be engaged during
the planning stages and would be able to identify at the outset possible
anomalies. Turkey, in order to move into the nuclear arena, also [signed
a Cooperative Nuclear
Agreement](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CDOC-110hdoc90/html/CDOC-110hdoc90.htm),
known informally as a 123 Agreement, with the United States in 2008.
This agreement places stringent controls on the technologies that Turkey
receives from the US, or the technologies from any other state that has
a 123 Agreement with the US. With the IAEA safeguards system and other
international regimes, such as the Nuclear Suppliers Group, this
additional layer of protection would help to prohibit illicit use of
materials Finally, [[Turkey's]{.underline} **[external security
outlook]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[alliance
structure]{.underline}** [are]{.underline}]{.mark} also [**[dramatically
different]{.mark}** than that of Iran's]{.underline}. [[Scholars have

[[have [found](https://jcr.sagepub.com/content/58/3/429.abstract) that
**security guarantees significantly reduce the likelihood for
proliferation**]{.underline}]{.mark}. While Iran could be said to have
sponsor states in China and Russia, these relationships are largely
driven by economic interests and self-interested foreign policy.

question of whether Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, is really a US ally was put to US defense secretary Mark
Esper on Fox television this morning. "No, I think [Turkey]{.underline},
the arc of their [behavior]{.underline} over the past several years [has
been terrible]{.underline}," he said. Which brings up a problem: **[The
US is storing perhaps 50 air-dropped thermonuclear bombs at its Incirlik
Airbase in southern Turkey]{.underline}**, less than 100 miles from the
Syrian border where this conflict is taking place. [The nuclear
stockpile dates back to the Cold War]{.underline}, when the US sought to
keep a sufficient supply of atomic weapons deployed in Europe to deter
potential Soviet aggression. Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and
Italy also host similar arsenals, and the US trains the participating
nations in the use of the doomsday devices. Today, [these bombs remain
in place largely because of inertia, and the hope that countries like
Turkey will see the depot as sufficient reason not to develop nuclear
weapons of their own]{.underline}. It doesn't seem to be working: Last
month, Turkish president Recep Tayyip [Erdogan said he could "not
accept" efforts to prevent Turkey from developing its own atomic bombs.
But instability in Turkey and the region, along with Ankara's close
relationship with Russia, have had American strategists talking about
re-locating their weapons for years]{.underline}. (The US does not
officially discuss the arsenal, but there is no indication that the
stockpile has been removed.) A 2016 coup attempt against Erdogan saw
power to the base cut off for several days, raising questions about the
safety of the stash. More recently, [Turkey has purchased advanced air
defense technology from Russia, which has raised hackles in the US
defense community because Turkey was a partner in developing the US F-35
fighter-bomber]{.underline}. [The US Air Force canceled the partnership
over worries that Russia would be able to learn from Turkey how to
better shoot down US aircraft.]{.underline} Now, [Russia and Turkey are
coordinating military policy in northern Syria, with the US as a
bystander]{.underline}. The move to exploit a civil conflict in Syria to
gain a geopolitical advantage typify how strategists see a new era of
great power competition playing out. One reason to be worried is that
the recent shift in US strategy launched by Trump appears to have caught
the US military establishment by surprise. It's not clear how prepared
the US is to deal with the knock-on effects of the about-face, whether
it is disappointed former allies like the Kurds (paywall) or ISIS
fighters escaping from prison camps, much less the calculus of nuclear
deterrence.

grist for the mill.

Still, **[[every]{.underline}]{.mark}** review
[**[conference]{.underline}** [seems to precipitate]{.underline} **[a
sense of unease]{.underline}**]{.mark} over the future of the treaty.
[[This year's no different]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the [NPT will
**survive**]{.mark}]{.underline} this conference, too, because [most
[treaty members]{.mark} **continue**]{.underline} [to
[believe]{.mark}]{.underline} that [an uncontrolled [spread
of]{.mark}]{.underline} nuclear [[weapons would make for a]{.mark} more
[dangerous]{.mark}]{.underline} international [security
[environment]{.mark}]{.underline} than the one we already have.
Moreover, [**[few]{.mark}** states [would want the **NPT**]{.mark} **[to
collapse]{.mark}**]{.underline} and leave the Treaty on the Prohibition
of Nuclear Weapons (which still hasn't been ratified by enough states to
enter into force) in sole possession of the field.

#### [Even if]{.underline} it collapsed, the US can use the alliance network to [tamp down]{.underline} proliferation 

**Onderco 20** \[Michal Onderco, Assistant Professor of International
Relations in the Department of Public Administration and Sociology at

<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2336825X20908469>, y2k\]

An argument could be made that [**[even if]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [rest of the [world]{.mark}]{.underline}
somehow [[lost interest in the NPT]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited [**[S]{.underline}**t]{.mark}ates
[[would remain]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[''enforcer of last
resort'']{.underline}**]{.mark} (cf. Horovitz, 2015 for a version of
this argument). This argument is consistent with the standard account of
the success of the United States' unilateral attempts to constrain the
nuclear developments among friends and enemies alike (Gavin, 2012;
Miller, 2018). Yet [many]{.underline} of the
[[tools]{.underline}]{.mark} that the **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[would use to compel]{.mark}
[countries to give up]{.mark} their]{.underline} [nuclear [ambitions
stem from]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates' [**[unique position]{.mark}** within
the international system]{.underline}, [[where]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited [**[S]{.underline}**t]{.mark}ates
[[sits in]{.underline} **[the center]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} various [[political]{.underline}]{.mark} and
economic [[networks]{.underline}]{.mark} (cf. e.g. Winecoff, 2015).
[These [tools]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [[work]{.underline}]{.mark}
only [[as long as]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and]{.underline} its [**[allies]{.underline}**
[dominate]{.underline}]{.mark} the world (Nexon, 2018). Yet the
centrality of the United States in various networks comes under strain,
not least because the United States decided to 'weaponize' these
interdependence networks (Farrell and Newman, 2019). One only needs to
listen to the repeated calls for alternative payment channels (such as
the EU's Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges, known as INSTEX, a
channel for conducting business with Iran) and different currencies to
settle transactions to understand the phenomenon (for a recent overview,
see McDowell, 2019). And while the rising powers do not fundamentally
question the goal of nonproliferation, they are not as heavily invested
in it. Shell

#### Security commitments are key to [effective non-prolif]{.underline}\-\--sustains the NPT -- Russia cooperation is irrelevant in a world with the NPT BUT we can walk and chew gum at the same time with prolif and Russia

**Daalder 20** \[Ivo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global
Affairs, served as U.S. Ambassador to NATO from 2009 to 2013, "Can 50
Years of Minimizing Nuclear Proliferation Continue?" 3-5,

y2k\]

Imagine we are living in the year 2030. New seismic activity indicates
an underground nuclear explosion somewhere near the Arctic Circle. One
more country announces it's joining the once-exclusive club of nuclear
weapons states that has now grown to 20 nations --- more than double the
number in 2020.

The trouble started in 2023, when a group of former
**[allies]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [renounce]{.underline}d their
**[adherence]{.underline}** [to the]{.underline}
**[N]{.underline}**uclear Non**[p]{.underline}**roliferation
**[T]{.underline}**reaty [and opted to acquire]{.underline} the very
nuclear [weapons capabilities]{.underline} that they foreswore decades
earlier.

Since then, [nations **across the world**]{.underline} had
[race]{.underline}d [to **acquire the bomb**]{.underline}, and [the
global security situation]{.underline} had [become]{.underline}
increasingly **[precarious]{.underline}**. Sooner or later, [as centers
of]{.underline} [nuclear decision making **multiplied**]{.underline},
[one of those weapons]{.underline} was [**bound** to go off,
with]{.underline} [consequences]{.underline}
**[incalculable]{.underline}** [for all.]{.underline}

**[A far-fetched future]{.underline}**? [Perhaps]{.underline}. The
nonproliferation treaty entered into force 50 years ago, on March 5,
1970. At the time, only five nations --- the United States, the Soviet
Union, China, Britain and France --- were recognized as nuclear weapons
states. Just four more countries --- India, Israel, Pakistan and North
Korea --- have since acquired the bomb. And, yet, [this scenario is more
**plausible**]{.underline} now [than many may think]{.underline}.

To understand why, we need to go back to 1963, when President John F.
Kennedy warned of a "world in which 15 or 20 or 25 nations may have
these weapons." Kennedy expressed the widely held belief that further
proliferation was likely, if not inevitable. Every nation that possessed
the capability to build a bomb had done so and American officials
worried that the trend was about to accelerate.

That didn't happen. [Having stood at the brink of]{.underline} nuclear
[war during the Cuban missile crisis]{.underline} in 1962, the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [and
the]{.underline} [Soviet Union]{.underline} [**[redoubled]{.underline}**
[efforts to **stabilize**]{.underline}]{.mark} their **[[nuclear
relationship]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and prevent other states from
**crossing**]{.underline} [the nuclear]{.underline}
[threshold]{.underline}. The **[[n]{.mark}on[p]{.mark}roliferation
[t]{.mark}reaty]{.underline}** [[was]{.mark} one
[result]{.mark}]{.underline} of those efforts. Under the treaty, states
that didn't have nuclear weapons pledged not to develop or acquire them,
while those that did committed to eventual nuclear disarmament.

**[But]{.underline}** [[it wasn't]{.mark} just]{.underline} U.S.-Soviet
[[arms control]{.mark} negotiations [that turned the]{.mark}
**proliferation [tide]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the 1960s. [**[Even more
important]{.underline}** [was **Washington's
determination**]{.underline} [to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[assure]{.underline} its [[allies]{.mark} in **Europe**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[Asia]{.underline}** that [they could **rely on
America**]{.underline} for their nuclear security. [Only after they were
convinced]{.underline} that the [American]{.underline} nuclear
[guarantee was **credible**]{.underline}, [did
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline} like Germany and Japan [decide to
**[forego]{.mark}**]{.underline} a national **[[nuclear
option]{.underline}]{.mark}** and join the nonproliferation treaty.

Whenever new developments seemed to call the American guarantee into
question --- as when a new generation of Soviet medium-range missiles
were deployed in Europe in the 1970s and when North Korea expanded its
nuclear and missile programs in the 1990s and 2000s --- Washington
worked to reassure its allies that its nuclear commitment remained
strong and credible.

[In recent years]{.underline}, **[new questions]{.underline}**
[about]{.underline} the [credibility of the]{.underline} American
[nuclear guarant]{.underline}ee have [returned]{.underline}. [One reason
is the **changing strategic environment**]{.underline}. [In
Europe]{.underline}, [a more **adventurous**]{.underline} and
better-armed **[Russia]{.underline}** [no longer shies away]{.underline}
from using military force, as its invasion of Ukraine and its support
for the Assad regime in Syria have underscored. [In Asia]{.underline},
[**China**'s rapid]{.underline} [rise]{.underline} has
[expanded]{.underline} its [military reach]{.underline} throughout the
Asia-Pacific, and [**No**rth **Ko**rea]{.underline} has [emerged as a
potent foe, armed with nuclear]{.underline} [weapons]{.underline} and
long-range missiles that threaten the entire region.

Even as threats have multiplied, allied doubts about the American
commitment have grown perceptibly since Donald Trump entered the White
House expressing deep distrust of alliances. His early failure to
reconfirm NATO's Article 5 mutual defense commitment, his threat to
leave NATO if allies did not sharply increase military spending, his
insistence that Asian allies greatly increase their financial
contributions to maintain the U.S. military presence, his musings about
some allies acquiring their own nuclear capabilities --- all these have
increased uncertainty in allied capitals about whether they can still
count on the United States.

Which raises the question: [if not the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [who will **assure**
their]{.underline} **[nuclear security?]{.underline}** [So
far]{.underline}, [**[few]{.mark}** experts [argue]{.mark} that
the]{.underline} [answer lies in]{.underline} **[[a]{.mark} national
[nuclear program]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [But]{.underline}]{.mark} as
[**[worries]{.underline}** [about]{.underline}]{.mark} [America's
**[security]{.mark} [commitments]{.mark}**]{.underline} [continue to
[grow]{.mark}]{.underline}, more [[countries may **reach**]{.underline}
[that conclusion]{.underline}]{.mark}.

To forestall this danger, Washington needs to act swiftly.

First, the president needs to unconditionally reaffirm America's
fundamental commitment to the security and defense of its allies. Yes,
the allies need to do more and spend more, but it is in America's vital
interest to ensure that they are safe and secure --- and without their
own nuclear weapons.

Second, America and the other nuclear powers need to resume serious
discussions on arms control. As a first step, Washington and Moscow need
to extend the New START treaty capping their long-range nuclear forces
before it expires next year. Next, along with Britain, France and China,
they should start a serious dialogue on how to limit their nuclear
capabilities and work together to prevent further proliferation. And all
of them should halt nuclear modernization efforts while those talks
continue.

**[[For 50 years]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the
**[[n]{.underline}]{.mark}**on**[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}**roliferation
**[[t]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty [has largely [succeeded in
preventing]{.mark} **more** [countries from going nuclear]{.mark}.
**America's [security alliances]{.mark} have [played an essential
role]{.mark} in that success**]{.underline}.
[[Reaffirming]{.underline}]{.mark} those
[[alliances]{.underline}]{.mark} and committing to serious arms control
efforts [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} help [[ensure]{.mark} its
[continuation]{.mark} in **the next 50 years.**]{.underline}

### Expulsion Bad\-\--ME

#### Turkey is an essential ally in NATO key to stabilization measures in the middle east

**Pamir et al 20**\-- Ahmet Üzümcü- Former Director-General of the OPCW,

But the critics do not stop there. [There is the wider accusation of
Turkish unreliability]{.underline}. It should not be forgotten that
[Turkey has been a reliable member of NATO for the past seven
decades]{.underline}. [It contributed significantly to the Alliance's
collective defence and deterrence in the Cold War]{.underline}. By tying
up a large portion of Soviet troops in its region, it considerably
reduced the pressure on Central Europe. Ironically, the [Western
European countries were able to build their Union gradually in a secure
and stable environment ensured by NATO, with Turkey shouldering a heavy
military burden]{.underline}. [With the end of the Cold
War]{.underline}, alone among the existing allies, Turkey's security
situation worsened. [Turkey found itself]{.underline} increasingly
[exposed in a region of turmoil engulfed by]{.underline} several [armed
conflicts.]{.underline} The [new and emerging security
risks]{.underline}, including terrorism, [have impacted
Turkey]{.underline} as much, if not [more]{.underline}, [than any other
Ally]{.underline}. Turkey feels itself on a new front line. But
throughout this period, [Turkey has remained an island of stability in a
volatile region]{.underline}. Even though instability and disorder are
on our doorstep, Turkey has fulfilled all its NATO obligations and
provided security and stability rather than consuming them. [Turkey has
stood solid behind every key NATO decision. NATO invoked Article
V]{.underline} of the Treaty for the first time [following the
9/11]{.underline} terrorist [attacks]{.underline} against the U.S. Under
the Taliban, Afghanistan had become a haven for international terrorism.
As a staunch ally, **[Turkey has played a significant role in NATO's
stabilization efforts in Afghanistan.]{.underline}** [It has deployed
troops and other military assets]{.underline} in harm's way alongside
other allies and partners. **[Turkey has never deviated from the NATO
policy "in together-adjust together-out together".]{.underline}**
Moreover, [Turkey's especially close and long-standing ties with
Afghanistan has enabled the Alliance as a whole to benefit from its
knowledge, expertise and political weight in that country]{.underline}.
Moreover, [the fight against ISIS]{.underline}, a serious concern for
the whole world, wo[uld not have been so successful without Turkey's
participation and assistance.]{.underline} **[Turkey has become an
essential partner]{.underline}** in this struggle by joining the
coalition against ISIS. [It made three air bases, including Incirlik,
available for the Allies, enabling decisively effective military
operations]{.underline}. Elsewhere, in the Balkans and Iraq, **[Turkey
has contributed to NATO's stabilization efforts]{.underline}**. [In
terms of NATO's priority core task, collective defence, successive
governments in Turkey have never wavered in their commitment to the
Alliance]{.underline}. [Turkey's current contribution cannot be
overstated.]{.underline} [It]{.underline} currently [hosts]{.underline}
a range of NATO commands and and assets, essential to NATO's collective
defence, including Allied Land Command ([LANDCOM]{.underline}) in Izmir
[and]{.underline} the NATO Rapid Deployable Corps ([NRDC]{.underline})
in Istanbul. Significantly, [Turkey will be the lead nation]{.underline}
in 2021 [in command of the 'Spearhead Force']{.underline} of NATO
(VJTF). This force can be deployed at short notice to any allied country
considered under threat. We, as former Turkish Ambassadors to NATO, are
proud to confirm that our country has assumed its responsibilities
toward the Alliance in their entirety[. Turkey is one of the few allies
to fulfil its commitment to spend 2% of its GDP on defence]{.underline};
[it has the second largest army in NATO]{.underline}, [and it ranks
fourth in contributions to NATO operations and fifth in NATO
expenditures]{.underline}. In an Alliance of thirty nations, there are
inevitably [ups and downs]{.underline} in the relations between allies.
[In the past]{.underline}, these differences **[have turned out to be
circumstantial and temporary.]{.underline}** They were eventually
resolved, mostly bilaterally, but sometimes with the use of good offices
of the Secretary General or other Allies. **[There is no reason to
suppose that the current spate of disputes will not be resolved in the
same way]{.underline}**. [During the recent tension]{.underline} in the
eastern Mediterranean, the [NATO]{.underline} Secretary General, Jens
Stoltenberg, took the welcome initiative of [invit]{.underline}ing
G[reece and Turkey to agree upon deconfliction measures.]{.underline}
[The parties concerned must be engaged in a dialogue in order to achieve
an equitable solution]{.underline} in line with international law.
[Other countries should facilitate this process by encouraging
dialogue]{.underline} among two longstanding allies. To conclude, there
needs to be a solution to the impasse presented by the procurement of
Russian-made S400s and the U.S. decisions both to disengage Turkey from
the F35 program and to apply sanctions on its ally's defence procurement
agency. A compromise would unleash much positive momentum. We believe
that [Turkey will continue to observe its obligations and commitments as
a reliable member of the Alliance]{.underline}. It will continue to
support the Alliance efforts toward global peace and security. **[The
Alliance would, no doubt, be weaker without the active participation and
support of Turkey.]{.underline}**

In February 2020, after more than a year of direct negotiations, [the
U.S. government and the Taliban signed a peace agreement that set a
timeline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from
Afghanistan]{.underline}. Under the agreement, the United States pledged
to draw down U.S. troops to approximately 8,500 within 135 days and
complete a full withdrawal within fourteen months. In return, the
[Taliban pledged to prevent territory under its control from being used
by terrorist groups and enter into negotiations with the Afghan
government]{.underline}. However, [no official cease-fire was put into
place]{.underline}. After a brief reduction in violence, the Taliban
quickly resumed attacks on Afghan security forces and civilians. Direct
talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban began months after
the agreed upon start of March 2020, faced multiple delays, and
ultimately made little progress. Viol[ence across Afghanistan continued
in 2020 and 2021 as the United States increased air strikes and raids
targeting the Taliban]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [the Taliban attacked
Afghan government and Afghan security forces targets and made
territorial gains.]{.underline} [Civilian casualties across Afghanistan
have remained high]{.underline} over the past several years. The United
Nations documented a then--record high of 10,993 civilian casualties in
2018. Although 2019 saw a slight decline, civilian casualties exceeded
10,000 for the sixth year in a row and brought the total UN-documented
civilian casualties since 2009 to more than 100,000. Despite another
decline in 2020, [the first half of 2021 saw a record high number of
civilian casualties as the Taliban ramped up their military offensive
amid the withdrawal of international troops. In addition to the
Taliban's offensive, Afghanistan faces a threat from the Islamic State
in Khorasan, which has also expanded its presence in several eastern
provinces, attacked Kabul, and targeted civilians with suicide attacks.
Uncertainty surrounding the future of international assistance has
strained the Afghan economy]{.underline}. Although [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and its allies pledged in late
2020 to continue providing support to the Afghan government, they [could
reduce aid following the Taliban takeover. Such a move could compound
Afghanistan's **deteriorating economic situation.**]{.underline}
Concerns The United States has an interest in attempting to preserve the
many political, human rights, and security gains that have been achieved
in Afghanistan since 2001. [The Taliban takeover of the country could

al-Qaeda. [The takeover also threatens to reverse advances made in

The [Turkish Armed Forces left Afghanistan]{.underline}, [but **Ankara
is poised to play key security and diplomatic roles in the
country**]{.underline}. Turkish officials announced the evacuation of
the Turkish military contingency from the Kabul Airport on August 25,
2021, despite separate discussions with the United States and the
Taliban for Turkey to continue running the Kabul International
Airport.\[1\] Top Turkish officials had argued that the Turkish forces
could continue to manage the security and operations of the airport as
they had since 2015 if the Taliban so desired.\[2\] [Ankara]{.underline}
also [pivoted to establishing relations with the Taliban]{.underline}
through the Turkish Embassy in Qatar at least as early as August 15,
when the Taliban reached Kabul, in a likely bid [to maintain and expand
the Turkish role in Afghanistan]{.underline}.\[3\] [The bulk of Turkish
forces left Afghanistan by August 27 under reported Taliban pressure,
but the Turkish Embassy is continuing its operations]{.underline} as of
September 3.\[4\] Recent statements by both the [Taliban and Ankara
indicate that Turkey is exploring ways to help run the Kabul Airport and
support the new Taliban government]{.underline}.\[5\] [Ankara and the
Taliban both believe Turkey can play a role in shaping the new
Afghanistan. Ankara will likely double down on its political and
reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan to **prove its ability to
stabilize and shape conflicts as a regional power**.]{.underline} Turkey
has provided training for Afghan security forces, political outreach to
various Turkic communities, aid and private sector investment, and
non-combatant military services. [Turkey refrained from participating in
military campaigns against the Taliban and instead took on logistical
and security duties like Kabul Airport security, intelligence sharing,
and funding and training at Afghan military schools]{.underline}.\[6\]
[Turkish officials leveraged this non-combatant history when they
offered the Taliban further "technical and security
assistance]{.underline}" in August.\[7\] Taliban spokesperson Mohammad
Naeem said that the [**Taliban wants Turkey's support** in areas ranging
from reconstruction and economy to healthcare and education]{.underline}
on August 25.\[8\] Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan views such a
Turkish role as a natural one, underlining Turkey's long-standing ties
to its fellow Muslim country with a significant Turkic population.
Ankara and the Taliban are also in talks about the future of Kabul
Airport. President Erdogan stated that the [Taliban asked Turkey to run
the operations of Kabul International Airport]{.underline} if the
Taliban provided its security instead of Turkish forces. However,
anonymous Turkish officials claimed that Turkey would only run the
airport in partnership with Qatar and only if security was provided by a
private security firm of former Turkish soldiers.\[9\] SADAT
International Defense Consultancy, known for credible reports of its
supervision and payment of Turkish-backed Syrian fighters in Libya and
Azerbaijan, is the only private Turkish security company that could
adopt such a duty.\[10\] Discussions are ongoing as of September 3 and
the Taliban's position remains unclear. Turkey's Ambitions and
Constraints Afghanistan is a theater of opportunity, but not an
existential security problem for Ankara. Afghanistan poses little direct
threat to Turkish national security, in contrast to the perceived
terrorism and internal stability threats the country is fighting in
northern Iraq and Syria. [Afghanistan's current situation presents an
opportunity for Ankara to maximize its political and]{.underline}
security reach by filling growing gaps in foreign investment, projects,
and support and by **[advancing NATO interests]{.underline}**. [Turkey
can advance its mutual interests with NATO in Afghanistan while pursuing
its own objectives as an aspiring power in the region]{.underline}. [A
successful bid in helping stabilize Afghanistan could elevate Turkey as
a necessary and capable security player in the region and to its
allies]{.underline}---two longstanding goals of the Erdogan government.
During an August 25, 2021, speech to celebrate the anniversary of a
historic Turkic battle, Erdogan said "We transformed from a country of
existential battles inside its own borders to one that has a say in
every critical matter in the world."\[11\] This self-perception of
Turkey as a regional powerbroker helps drive President Erdogan and
Ankara's top leadership's pursuit of more activist policies beyond
Turkey's immediate neighborhood---including in Afghanistan.

Turkey will likely perceive one or multiple of the following objectives
in the near term as advantageous to its regional and global standing:
Deliver legitimacy to a new Afghan government: [**As a Muslim NATO
country**, Turkey could be a useful partner for the Taliban leadership
to gain international acceptance and legitimacy as well as access to
global financial systems]{.underline}. Advance the Turkish security role
in line with, and beyond, NATO [goals: Turkey has been offering military
training and security cooperation]{.underline} deals to an increasing
number of developing countries. Turkish forces have hosted Afghan,
Somali, Azerbaijani, Pakistani, Libyan, and other security forces for
capacity-building trainings as part of, or beyond, NATO missions. Turkey
will likely continue its trainings with Afghanistan and offer new
technical and military cooperation opportunities to the Taliban
government. Insert Erdogan-friendly Turkish companies to Afghanistan for
profit: Turkish companies with strong ties to the Erdogan government
have won significant reconstruction contracts in Libya, Iraq, Somalia,
Syria, and elsewhere. Turkey will likely look for similar construction
and investment opportunities in Afghanistan for profit and to benefit
the crony network Erdogan cultivates for government-friendly companies.
Improve Turkey's position within NATO: **[Turkey is one of the few, if
not the only, NATO countries that will maintain a diplomatic mission in
Afghanistan.]{.underline}** [It has also been in frequent contact with
many NATO allies to discuss developments in Afghanistan and demand
financial support.]{.underline}\[12\] Ankara will seek to use its unique
position in and access to Afghanistan to improve relations with NATO
allies, particularly the United States, and gain concessions. Posi[tion
Turkey as a regional power for security and stabilization]{.underline}:
President [Erdogan suggested that Turkey]{.underline}, Turkic Central
Asian countries, and Pakistan [could work with the Taliban if they take
"positive steps]{.underline}" during a speech on August 29.\[13\]
Erdogan has not specified what those steps include or how Turkey might
support them, but [Turkey could leverage its ties to Central Asian
countries to promote regional security initiatives.]{.underline}
Meanwhile, Ankara also faces the risks of deteriorating public opinion,
increased refugee flows, and growing financial costs

"Change in Turkish foreign policy toward the Middle East," MAR 04, 2022,
https://www.dailysabah.com/opinion/op-ed/change-in-turkish-foreign-policy-toward-the-middle-east)//mcu

Turkish foreign policy mainly aims to protect its interests in a
strained global and regional environment. Turkey always tried to create
conditions for sustainable peace and development with both neighboring
and more distant states. Ankara has recently become more involved and
active in the Middle East. Some analysts are of the view that this
change indicates Turkey is moving away from the West, as they observe
that Turkey\'s confidence in the region is mismatched with its Western
coordination. However, others believe that security, power projection,
rational considerations and a mix of national interests have forced
Turkey to drive its foreign policy toward the Middle East. After the
Arab uprising, regional geopolitics and security challenges opened new
channels for Turkish foreign policy, which led Ankara to even get
involved in the region. It started humanitarian and economic
engagements. With the passage of time, [Ankara's involvement in the
Middle East has extended and it has become the third party in the
regional conflicts]{.underline}. [To normalize ties with the Middle
Eastern countries,]{.underline} especially with [Saudi
Arabia,]{.underline} the United Arab Emirates [(UAE) and Israel, would
open new channels for]{.underline} augmenting [Turkey's diplomatic,
strategic and economic assets in its foreign policy.]{.underline} The
strained ties the between leading regional actors have proven
deleterious to understanding the true prospect of economic relations. A
shift and a response The shift in Ankara's Middle East policy is a
response to external factors -- both regional and international, and
domestic issues related to security and economy. [Turkey has begun to
change its positions and restart its relations]{.underline}, which had
previously been based on hostility. Washington has always remained a key
player in the Middle East, but the United States administration under
President Joe Biden prioritized East Asia, focused on its own domestic
matters and has pushed away diplomacy in the Middle East, unlike the
previous Donald Trump administration. In the meantime, the U.S. has
started reevaluating its military forces from the region. The U.S. has
made it clear that it will not be part of the Saudi intervention of
Yemen, and Washington may go back to the nuclear deal with Iran. These
changes triggered and pushed Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt and the
UAE towards a de-escalation process. On the other hand, Russia\'s
growing influence and the U.S. decreasing engagement in the region
pushed Turkey to act it to balance between the two. Turkey has a long
relationship with the U.S. and Russia, but with some differences --
however, it has maintained a good balance in Syria and Libya. In this
context, **[Ankara's Middle East policy has shifted into a new track to
rebalance the region]{.underline}**. Saudi Arabia a key actor Last year
at the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Summit, [Gulf countries signed the
Al-Ula declaration]{.underline} and formally ended the dispute with
Qatar. [This]{.underline} regional development [created further
encouragement for Ankara to take the plunge]{.underline} with Riyadh,
Cairo and Abu Dhabi. Since then, [Turkey and Qatar have started
negotiations with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE for
reconciliation]{.underline}. [Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [is one key
regional player in the Middle East region]{.underline}. The [good
relations between Ankara and Riyadh would prove to be a game
changer]{.underline} for this region. **[The cooperation initiative has
been started between Ankara and Riyadh]{.underline}**, [their relations
have appeared]{.underline} in a [positive]{.underline} dynamic after a
phone conversation between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Saudi
Arabia's King Salman ahead of a G-20 leaders summit in 2021. Recently,
Erdoğan visited the UAE for bilateral and economic cooperation with a
flurry of agreements during his first visit to the Gulf state since
2013. No doubt, [Riyadh also wants close relations with
Ankara]{.underline}, which will help Saudi to counter rivals or
disrupters. [The normal ties between Riyadh and Ankara would take
preference over all regional reconciliation efforts. This move would be
a good option for Saudi Arabia]{.underline} to get much-needed space [to
enhance its capacity for political activity, connectivity, and
cooperation]{.underline} with various other regional states, which are
perceived as Riyadh's rivals. **[Better relations between both states
would open new economic, political and defense
opportunities]{.underline}**, where Saudis may retain their traditional
regional role and effectively deal with security challenges. [The
regional power game]{.underline} between the main stakeholders of the
region [is persistent strategic competition, which will **only
destabilize** their diplomatic positions, and create more economic cost
than benefits]{.underline}. The current developments and [the changing
nature of their regional de-escalation approach is a sign of a
**reconciliatory drift** in the region, which will normalize the
strategic and economic situation in the region]{.underline}. To sum up,
regardless of the problems in balancing Saudi Arabia, Iran and Israel,
[the current change in the foreign policy of the Middle East is a good
option for Turkey to move forward with win-win cooperation]{.underline}.
Certainly, [Turkey possesses such capability to go with Middle Eastern
countries for their collective cooperation.]{.underline}

### Swindland Bad

#### Inducting Sweden and Finland leaves NATO [exposed]{.underline} and [vulnerable]{.underline} to Russian aggression.

Emma **Ashford** **22**. Senior fellow, Scowcroft Center for Strategy
and Security at the Atlantic Council. \"NATO Should Think Twice Before
Accepting Finland and Sweden.\" Washington Post. 5-30-2022.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/nato-should-think-twice-before-accepting-finland-and-sweden/2022/05/30/b412ee2a-dff7-11ec-ae64-6b23e5155b62_story.html.

Yet [from the point of view of]{.underline} existing NATO members ---
and particularly [the US --- it's still not necessarily a net win.
Finland and Sweden have long focused their militaries on defending
**their own territories**, raising **doubts** about their value in
contributing to a common defense]{.underline}, which is at the heart of
NATO's charter.

And while both nations have pledged to increase their military spending
and ability to bolster Europe's broader defenses, it is also possible
that they would not. Instead, [they may **free-ride** on America's
military strength --- and its **nuclear umbrella** --- as so many
European states have done for years]{.underline}. According to the
International Monetary Fund, [**neither** country **comes close** to
meeting the NATO goal of **spending 2%** of GDP on defense.]{.underline}

History suggests [the most likely outcome is two more states **adding**
to America's **defense burden** at a time when Washington should be
**pivoting** to **Asia**.]{.underline}

Consider also the question of the defensibility of new NATO territory.
Admitting Sweden could be strategically beneficial, allowing NATO forces
to better control the Baltic Sea and to use Gotland Island, at an
important chokepoint off the Baltic States, as a staging ground for any
future conflict.

[Finnish territory, in contrast, is a **strategic nightmare**. It would
**dramatically increase** the alliance's **exposure** to any **future
attacks** by Moscow: the country shares an **800-mile** border with
Russia that]{.underline}, as a recent study from the Center for
Strategic and International Studies put [it, is "**highly exposed** to
Russian military threats."]{.underline}

There are grab bag of other reasons for caution, including the usual
concerns about expanding the alliance to an ever-more unwieldy set of
member states. It doesn't take a genius to predict that [32 nations will
be **even harder** to manage than 30]{.underline}. Before its Ukraine
moment, NATO was struggling to maintain the peace between Greece and
Turkey, few nations were meeting the 2% spending goal, and President
Emmanuel Macron of France had drawn headlines for suggesting the
alliance was experiencing "brain death."

Even in the face of Russia's aggression, [support for adding the two
members isn't unanimous]{.underline}. Turkey's vehement opposition to
Finland and Sweden may be an attempt to wring political concessions from
the alliance, but also owes a lot to these countries' support for
Kurdish causes.

[Alliance leaders should also consider the risk of **Russian
overreaction**. Moscow has started **three wars** over **potential**
NATO expansion --- **invading Georgia** in 2008 and **Crimea** in 2014
before the current war.]{.underline} While Moscow is clearly not able to
stage another major military campaign right now, [one cannot rule out
President Vladimir **Putin** doing something **irrational** in
**response** to a NATO expansion that takes the alliance within **200
miles** of his birthplace of St. Petersburg.]{.underline}

At the same time, it's not clear that Finland and Sweden are at
increased risk unless they are allowed NATO membership. [They have long
**relied** on their **neutral status** and **domestic** defense capacity
to **prevent crises**. Refusing to admit them to NATO is not hanging
them out to dry, but simply **retaining** a **workable status
quo**.]{.underline}

#### Expansion [alienates]{.underline} Russia\-\--triggers arms racing and escalation.

aspect of Sweden and Finland\'s application to join NATO.\" CNN.

The [most striking aspect]{.underline} of Sweden and Finland\'s
application to join NATO [is how **little debate** there is about
whether it\'s a **wise idea**.]{.underline}

The entry of the two Nordic nations would be the most significant
geopolitical outcome of the Ukraine war, transforming the strategic
security picture in northeastern Europe and adding hundreds of miles of
direct NATO borders with Russia.

For decades, even during the most tense moments of the Cold War, neither
country seemed to feel the need to join the Western military alliance
despite their proximity to the giant to their east. But that changed
this year, after Putin sent tanks rolling across the border into Ukraine
in February.

Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson on Sunday called the invasion
of Ukraine \"illegal and indefensible,\" and worried that Moscow might
do something similar \"in our immediate vicinity.\" Finnish President
Sauli Niinistö told CNN the same day that the invasion indicated Russia
was ready to attack an \"independent, neighboring country.\"

Many analysts believe that one of the main goals of Russia\'s invasion
was to weaken NATO by taking Kyiv\'s possible future membership off the
board. If so, it has backfired spectacularly. The alliance is now
stronger and more united than it has been for years, and it could soon
be much larger.

But [**expanding** NATO could also trigger **serious reverberations**.
Doubling the security alliance\'s direct frontier with Russia would be a
**personal blow** for Putin]{.underline}, who has focused on undermining
the Western alliance since he first became Russia\'s President, more
than 20 years ago. And [if Putin felt Russia was **already** being
**hemmed** in on its western flank]{.underline}, could [adding **two
more** NATO members during the **worst tension** between the West and
Moscow in decades **exacerbate** the Russian leader\'s
**paranoia**]{.underline}?

In the 1990s, revered US diplomat George Kennan --- the founder of the
Cold War containment policy of Russia --- warned that [NATO expansion
would **alienate Russia** and cause an **adverse**
reaction.]{.underline} A contemporary counterargument would be that
Moscow\'s terrible losses in Ukraine, dented military prowess and
failure to siege Kyiv show that it is too weak to do anything about an
expanding NATO. And why should Putin get any say in who joins the
alliance anyway?

The Kremlin\'s response to Finland and Sweden hasn\'t exactly been
thundering so far. But [it\'s still a formidable **nuclear power** and
any decision to move missiles or tactical nuclear weapons **closer** to
**NATO borders** could **trigger** a new game of **brinkmanship** in
Europe.]{.underline}

#### Sweden and Finland in NATO incurs [multiple paths]{.underline} of Russian retaliation\-\--[provocations]{.underline}, [cyberattacks]{.underline}, [energy wars]{.underline}, etc.

[1) More **NATO provocations**]{.underline}

Over the years, [Russia has made **repeated** provocative **incursions**
near or into NATO allies' airspace and these seem to have **increased**
in **frequency** in the last few years. With **Sweden's** and
**Finland's** latest move to join NATO, **experts** believe the alliance
should prepare itself for more **provocations** from
Russia]{.underline}.

"[This **changes** the **security environment** for the entire **Baltic
Sea** and for the **Arctic**]{.underline}," retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges,
former commanding general of the U.S. Army in Europe, told CNBC on
Monday.

"Of course there will continue to be airspace violations, just like
there are over other NATO countries, but we're a defensive alliance and
we're going to react coolly and professionally. The last thing that the
Russians want is to get into a fight with all 30 NATO nations, soon to
be 32," he told CNBC's "Capital Connection."

"\[Putin's\] going to complain about it, he's going to threaten things
but he actually has nothing that he can do as most of his military is
tied up in Ukraine, so I don't see any real threat against Sweden or
Finland."

Russian provocations of NATO are nothing new. [In 2020, NATO air forces
across Europe were scrambled more than **400 times** to **intercept**
unknown aircraft approaching the alliance's airspace with almost 90% of
these missions **in response** to flights by Russian **military
aircraft**]{.underline}, NATO said in a statement.

Last March, NATO planes were scrambled 10 times in a six-hour period in
response to an "unusual peak" of Russian warplanes near the alliance's
airspace over the North Atlantic, North Sea, Black Sea and Baltic Sea.

[2) **Cyberattacks** and **soldiers**]{.underline}

Sweden and Finland have both insisted that joining NATO is not a move
against Russia but both concede the decisions have been taken in light
of Moscow's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.

Sweden's prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, told CNBC on Sunday that
her country felt NATO membership was the best thing for its security,
saying "[what kind of retaliation there can be is up to Putin, we see
there can be **cyberattacks** and **hybrid attacks** and other
measures]{.underline}, but it is all up to them," she told CNBC's Steve
Sedgwick in Stockholm.

Meanwhile, Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde said in the transition
period before Sweden and Finland become full NATO members, heightened
tensions are likely, noting "[we foresee more military **troops** close
to our border]{.underline}."

[3) **Energy wars**]{.underline}

[Another potential space for **retaliation**, and possible **Russian
punishment** for NATO's expansion, could come in the **energy
sphere**]{.underline}.

[Russia still holds a **powerful card** in this area because it has
traditionally accounted for around **40%** of the EU's **gas
imports**]{.underline}. And while [Europe]{.underline} scrambles for
alternative energy sources to reduce its dependence on Russia as a
provider of oil and gas, it [is **still reliant** on it.]{.underline}

Gilles Moec, group chief economist at AXA Investment Managers, said in a
note Monday that [there was an "ever so present possibility Russia
'**turns the tap off'**]{.underline} its supply to the EU" although he
noted that, so far Moscow has restricted itself to "half measures" which
have not dried up supply --- reflecting the country's own dependence on
these financial resources.

A [day after Finland's leaders announced their **support** for **NATO
membership**, Russian state-owned utility company Inter RAO announced it
would **stop** exporting **electricity** to Finland]{.underline} from
Saturday (Finland gets about 10% of its electricity from Russia) citing
a lack of payment as a reason, although [the move was widely seen as
**retaliatory**.]{.underline}

#### Escalates to nuclear war

**Buchanan 22**, author of "Nixon's White House Wars: The Battles That
Made and Broke a President and Divided America Forever." (Pat, "Why
would US give a war guarantee --- to Finland?," *The Journal*,
<https://www.journal-news.net/why-would-us-give-a-war-guarantee-to-finland/article_01922d40-31e0-5711-9225-ee78c610b3e4.html)//BB>

Nervous about Russian President Vladimir Putin's intentions, [Finland
wants America legally and morally bound to fight Russia on its behalf,
should Putin invade Finland as he invaded Ukraine]{.underline}. From the
Finnish point of view, this is perfectly understandable. But why would
the United States consent to go to war with Russia, the largest nuclear
power on earth, for violating Finland's frontiers? Finland is not
Alaska; it is not Canada; it is 5,000 miles away. And no one ever
asserted during the Cold War, or for the decades since, that Finland was
a U.S. vital interest. Why, then, would we consent, in advance, to go to
war with Russia over Finland? President Joe Biden said last week that
NATO has an "open door" policy and Finland and Sweden are welcome, and
he looks forward to their joining. Consider what Biden is actually
saying and doing here. He is ceding to Finland, a country of 5.5 million
people with an 830-mile border with Putin's Russia, the right to
obligate the United States of America to go to war with Russia, if
Russia attacks Finland. What patriot would commit his own country, in
perpetuity, to go to war on behalf of another country not his own? Why
would America surrender to the Finns our freedom of action in deciding
whether or not to fight a nuclear-armed Russia? NATO is not a country
club; it is a military alliance Putin regards as an enemy. Every member
of that alliance is obliged to treat an attack on any one of its 30
members as an attack on all, and all are obligated to come to the
defense of the nation attacked. By welcoming Finland into NATO, Biden is
offering Helsinki the kind of war guarantee Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain gave to Poland in the spring of 1939, which led to Britain's
having to declare war on Sept. 3, 1939, two days after Germany invaded
Poland. How did that work out for Britain and the empire? In his
farewell address, President George Washington warned his countrymen
against "permanent alliances." In conscious echo of our first president,
Thomas Jefferson warned against "entangling alliances." NATO is a
military alliance that has been in existence since 1949. While it began
with the U.S., Canada and 10 European nations, it ended the Cold War
with 16. We have since added 14 more. Six of the nations NATO added
since the Cold War --- Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia,
Bulgaria, Romania --- were members of the USSR's Warsaw Pact. Three of
the newest NATO members --- Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania --- are former
republics of the Soviet Union. The last quarter-century of NATO's
encroachment into Russia's space and onto Russia's front porch has been
a leading cause of the worsening relationship between the world's two
great nuclear powers. [The repeated refusal of Biden and Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to rule out NATO membership for Ukraine
was a primary cause of Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. This
does not absolve Putin of culpability in launching the war on Ukraine,
but [it should tell us that any new members of NATO]{.underline}, [in
Russia's "near abroad," especially a new NATO member with an 830-mile
border with Russia from the Baltic to the Arctic, is **running a real
risk and raising the possibility of war**]{.underline}. Indeed, with
Russia's war in Ukraine in stalemate, having failed to achieve its
objectives in Kyiv, Kharkov and Odessa, [Russian officials have
repeatedly raised the prospect of a desperate resort to tactical nuclear
weapons to stop the bleeding. "Escalate to de-escalate" is the
slogan]{.underline}. [Bringing Sweden and Finland into
NATO]{.underline}, which has already elicited rage from Moscow and
ominous threats, is unlikely to reduce whatever pressure currently
exists to **[escalate to nuclear war]{.underline}**.

### AT Baltic War

#### There's [no chance]{.underline} of US/Russia war.

Aleksandr **Khramchikhin 18**, Deputy Director of the Institute for
Political and Military Analysis in Moscow, 1/25/2018, "Rethinking the
Danger of Escalation: The Russia-NATO Military Balance", Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace,
https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/01/25/rethinking-danger-of-escalation-russia-nato-military-balance-pub-75346

In an atmosphere of crisis permeated by mutual recriminations and
suspicions, both sides---[NATO and Russia]{.underline}---[have engaged
in a series of **military activities**]{.underline} [along the line of
contact.]{.underline} [These]{.underline} maneuvers in turn [have
triggered multiple warnings from both sides of a sharp deterioration in
European security, a growing [threat of]{.mark} a **military
[confrontation]{.mark}** [between Russia and NATO]{.mark}]{.underline},
and an urgent need to deescalate the situation in order to avoid a
catastrophic war with disastrous consequences for all. An emerging
[conventional wisdom maintains that the new Cold War in Europe, if
allowed to continue unchecked, runs the risk of escalating into a hot
war]{.underline} unless steps to reduce tensions are taken swiftly.

But [conventional wisdom [is]{.mark} often **[wrong]{.mark}**, and so it
is this time. The **hysteria** that has engulfed public
commentary]{.underline} throughout Europe about this ostensibly dire
military situation on the brink of getting out of hand [has
little]{.underline}, if any, [basis in fact. [Both]{.mark} sides in the
standoff **[exaggerate]{.mark}** the [tensions]{.mark} and the danger of
escalation]{.underline}, and the risks of the military moves---their own
and their adversary's---supposedly driving these tensions.

In reality, [the military [balance]{.mark} between Russia and NATO [is
**stable**]{.mark}, the [danger of escalation is **hardly**]{.mark}
approaching **[critical]{.mark}** levels, and little needs to be done
militarily to defuse the current tensions. The true cause of the
tensions is not military, but political and diplomatic]{.underline}.
Until those causes are resolved, tensions between Russia and the West
will remain high. **[The [likelihood of]{.mark} a military
[confrontation will remain low]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however,
[[because neither]{.mark} side's [posture points to]{.mark} a
[heightened]{.mark} state of [readiness]{.mark} or intention to go on
the offensive]{.underline}. Until that changes, political and diplomatic
tensions will remain mere tensions.

THE BALANCE, THEN AND NOW

The best evidence that the military situation in Europe is stable and
that the continent is not on the brink of World War III is in the forces
that each side has available for conducting military operations. [Even a
brief [comparison of]{.mark} the [present]{.mark}-day [arsenals]{.mark}
of Russia and NATO [to]{.mark} those of the Soviet Union and NATO during
the height of [the Cold War]{.mark} should **[allay fears]{.mark} of
military conflict**]{.underline} (see table 1). This comparison should
also take into account critically important political and psychological
factors. Russia's and NATO's present-day forces do not measure up well
against their predecessors of a generation ago.

[One remarkable feature of the present situation is that even though the
number of NATO member states has nearly doubled since the end of the
Cold War, the alliance's order of battle across many classes of weaponry
has decreased since 1982]{.underline}, when East-West tensions were
high. Over the past quarter century, [military technology has developed
rapidly, new weaponry has come online, and many advances in warfare have
taken place. However, the [arsenals]{.mark} of most European countries
[have had **minimal**]{.mark} qualitative [improvements]{.mark} that do
not begin to compensate for the major reductions in their military
capabilities.]{.underline} Major acquisitions of military hardware have
been limited mostly to wheeled armored personnel carriers (APCs) to be
employed in expeditionary warfare.

[The [size of]{.mark} the [U.S.]{.mark} military [presence]{.mark} in
Europe has [decreased]{.mark} to an even greater degree since the end of
the Cold War]{.underline}. At the beginning of 2016, the U.S. military
had deployed ten brigades in Germany, but only two of these (the 2nd
cavalry regiment and 12th combat aviation brigade) were actual fighting
elements; the remaining eight were purely support units.1 One American
airborne brigade is deployed in Italy.2 In 2017, the U.S. Air Force
component deployed in Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom had nine
wings, but these are primarily support units, and there are only six
fighting squadrons.

[These [cuts in]{.mark} military [hardware are consistent with]{.mark} a
general tendency in the West]{.underline} (to a greater extent in Europe
than in the United States) [to embrace ideas of]{.underline} hedonism,
**[[pacifism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, postmodernism, tolerance, and
political correctness. A 2016 Pew survey found that [Europeans
overall]{.underline}, with the exception of the Poles and Dutch, **[do
not support increasing defence spending]{.underline}**. [Many Europeans
are reluctant to support the use of hard power in international
affairs]{.underline}. A 2017 Pew survey found that Europeans are also
divided in terms of their willingness to come to a NATO ally's defense
against Russia, with Germany, the UK, and Spain demonstrating the least
support. Along with the falling birth rates experienced in these
countries, this shift in defense dynamics makes it virtually impossible
to conduct a war that would result in major loss of life.

[As a result of these shifts in attitudes and ideological trends, NATO
troops may be unlikely to demonstrate heroism and willingness to make
sacrifices, elements that are absolutely essential in
wartime]{.underline}. [Almost all NATO countries have transitioned to an
all-volunteer military force, which has further **decreased the
motivation of their military personnel**]{.underline}, [or at least
suggests that they are motivated more by money than by
patriotism]{.underline}. The transition to an all-volunteer force has
also resulted in increased defense spending, for reasons that deserve
further consideration.

Like those of its NATO rivals, [Russia's modern-day military
capabilities do not compare favorably with the combined military machine
of the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies]{.underline} (see table
2). Even a cursory comparison of Soviet and Eastern European militaries
at the height of the Cold War---in 1982---and now makes clear that
Russia is not poised for offensive action in the European theater.

THE HIGH COST OF WAR

[[NATO forces are highly sensitive to]{.mark} the risk of incurring
[casualties]{.mark}]{.underline}, and this heightened sensitivity was
one of the reasons many Western countries chose to develop a concept of
noncontact network-centric warfare heavily reliant on precision-guided
munitions (PGM). However, this approach requires extremely expensive
weaponry, equipment, ammunition, and supplies. Shrinking NATO military
forces and arsenals mean that significant losses of lives or hardware
have become unacceptable: losing even a few tanks and aircraft is now
almost a catastrophe, comparable to losing a battleship or an armored
division.

[A [high-intensity war that calls for large stocks of ammunition
is]{.mark} also becoming **[prohibitively
expensive]{.mark}**]{.underline}---a trend illustrated by the evolution
of wars that NATO countries have waged over the last quarter century. In
1991, NATO countries, with significant support from both Egypt and
Syria, roundly defeated Iraq's large and well-equipped army in Operation
Desert Storm. The coalition against Iraq used PGMs only against
high-value targets in the Desert Storm campaign.

### AT Arctic War

#### No Arctic war\-\--their ev is all hype.

Øystein **Tunsjø 20**, professor and head of the Asia programme at the
Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies, Norwegian Defence University
College, "The Great Hype: False Visions of Conflict and Opportunity in
the Arctic," Survival, Vol. 62, No. 5, 09-23-2020,
https://doi.org/10.1080/00396338.2020.1819649

In recent years [there has been an abundance of studies, reports,
articles and statements presenting the Arctic as a new
frontier]{.underline} for resource extraction and sea lanes of
communication.1 These studies claim that the receding Arctic ice
provides not just commercial opportunities, but also security challenges
that could fuel great-power rivalry and conflict.2 Yet, despite the
hype, there is little likelihood of a shipping bonanza or a
natural-resource boom in the Arctic.3 This does not mean that climate
change is unimportant for the region -- we can expect more shipping
activity, investment and competition as the ice cap recedes. But it is
important to maintain a balanced view of the opportunities and
challenges presented by the 'new Arctic'.4

Equally important, the **[[stakes in a changing Arctic are not high
enough to warrant]{.mark} a [great-power
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As in the past, [[it remains
unlikely]{.mark}]{.underline} that [military [force will be
used]{.mark}]{.underline} to resolve a conflict originating in the
Arctic. It is more likely that any [potential great-power
[competition]{.mark}]{.underline} in the High North [[between Russia and
NATO]{.mark} will [reflect]{.mark}]{.underline} the [more consequential
sources]{.underline} of competition and conflict [in [Eastern or
Southern Europe]{.mark}]{.underline} -- in other words, that conflict
might spill over into the High North from somewhere else.5 Developments
in the Arctic appear to have caused some observers to forget that
[[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} recent [naval [build-up
is]{.mark}]{.underline} [primarily focused on [safeguarding
traditional]{.mark} Russian security [interests]{.mark}]{.underline},
such as maintaining its sea-based nuclear deterrent and contesting sea
lanes of communication in the North Atlantic. Thus, it is a familiar
security challenge -- Russia's rivalry with the United States and NATO
over the European security order -- that has the highest potential for
creating conflict in the Arctic.

Similarly, the recent focus on [[China's]{.mark} Arctic [ambitions
minimises]{.mark}]{.underline} the [importance of the changing balance
of power in [East Asia]{.mark}]{.underline} as the primary source of
US--China competition. Beijing's foremost security concern is the US
response to China's activities in its own maritime periphery, but
Chinese behaviour will also determine the United States' global
strategic priorities. Sino-American competition will compel the US to
prioritise the Asia-Pacific, and thus to draw down its commitments to
other regions. This will constrain its options in the High North.

[Since [European states are **unprepared** to substitute]{.mark} for
American power, **Russian [advancements]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Europe
and the Arctic **[will primarily [reflect US retrenchment and]{.mark}
[European inertia]{.mark}, rather than improved Russian
capabilities]{.underline}**. Moreover, heightened US--China competition
in the Arctic, much like heightened competition with Russia, will be a
spillover effect of US--China rivalry in East Asia.

The new Arctic: land of opportunity?

[One of the [leading champions]{.mark}]{.underline} of the new Arctic
[has been [the Norwegian government]{.mark}]{.underline}. It defined the
region as a national priority in 2005 and launched an international
diplomatic offensive to increase international awareness of its
supposedly vast potential. In a speech in 2006 at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, Norway's
then-minister for foreign affairs Jonas Gahr Støre declared that 'in the
years to come ... the High North will be one of the most important
strategic areas in the world'.6 In 2014 Oslo released 'Norway's Arctic
Policy', which stated that 'the Arctic is the Norwegian Government's
most important foreign policy priority', adding that 'access to energy
resources and other natural resources is becoming easier, and new trade
routes are opening up in the north. All this is creating new
opportunities.'7 [Such claims have been echoed in other
countries]{.underline} too. US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, for
example, emphasised in a speech to the Arctic Council in May 2019 that

the Arctic is at the forefront of opportunity and abundance. It houses
13 percent of the world's undiscovered oil, 30 percent of its
undiscovered gas, and an abundance of uranium, rare earth minerals,
gold, diamonds, and millions of square miles of untapped resources ...
Steady reductions in sea ice are opening new passageways and new
opportunities for trade.8

[This kind of [public diplomacy, along with **exaggerated**]{.mark}
media [reporting]{.mark}]{.underline}, appears to have [[contributed
to]{.mark} the circulation of [imprudent claims and unfounded
assumptions about]{.mark} the opportunities presented]{.underline} by
the new Arctic -- and [about the [likelihood of conflict]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}.9

#### Russia's [peaceful]{.underline} in the Arctic and will [pursue cooperation]{.underline}.

Exaggeration". Valdai Club. Jul 7 2020.

[As [Russia's government]{.mark} has [promoted]{.mark} a more **[visible
presence in the Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}---nervously observed by
international governments aware of Russia's increased military presence
in its High North---a few **[related critical points seem often
disregarded.]{.underline}**

In summer 2007, while both the Mir-1 and Mir-2 submersibles were
assisting a planned Russian government expedition to map the seabed, the
famous flag-planting performance was funded by Frederik Paulsen, a
Swedish pharmaceutical entrepreneur and the event was organized by an
Australian-American group of deep-sea exploration enthusiasts. In other
words, this feat, which drew the ire of Canada's Foreign Minister and
focused international media attention on a "new Cold War," was unlikely
prearranged either to perform scientific research in support of Russia's
Lomonosov territorial claims nor as a statement of territorial
acquisition.

Although Moscow has always maintained interest in its Arctic, arguably
this interest is growing. A [[Russian]{.mark} naval
[doctrine]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}acknowledges that the Arctic is
among its priority regions, and Russia not only already possesses the
world's largest fleet of nuclear icebreakers but plans to increase its
size. This [[is used]{.mark} by some Western commentators [to point to
Russia's]{.mark} **military [advantage]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[]{.mark}relative to the United States in the Arctic. [From here,
[it]{.mark} then [is a **short-stretch**]{.mark} for some
commentators]{.underline} [[to]{.mark} note]{.underline} that [the 2014
events]{.underline} [concerning]{.underline}
Russian-[[Ukrain]{.underline}]{.mark}ian relations
[demonstrate]{.underline} [Russia's]{.underline} [readiness to **bend
and at times break** the rules of international conduct.]{.underline}

[**[But]{.underline}**]{.mark} as have other Arctic and non-Arctic
states, so too has **[[Russia benefited from]{.mark} international
[cooperation and rules-following in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
This is not least because the [complexities of operating in the Arctic's
exceptional environment demonstrates that [collaboration is]{.mark}
**inherently [positive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It is [this "exceptional
environment]{.mark}" that [makes]{.mark} certain [Arctic
endeavors]{.mark}---such as **search and rescue efforts, scientific
research, and marine pollution response**---[transnational]{.mark}, and
consequently **encourages collective responses**]{.underline}. Further,
the economic development of the Arctic---a transnational region with
major emerging market opportunities---is a key strategic objective of
Russia. President Putin, for example, recognizes that "The Northern Sea
Route as an international transport artery will rival traditional trade
lanes." Businesses require certainty and regulatory stability in order
both to minimize their risks and to pursue investing in the Arctic.
Uncertainties associated with an unstable political environment can lead
to a reduction in investment and diminished economic interest in the
Arctic---a situation both Arctic and non-Arctic stakeholders are
determined to avoid.

Although the placement on August 3, 2007 of a titanium flag on the
seabed grabbed headlines, this was not the first time a flag was planted
in the vicinity of the North Pole. On his third polar expedition, and
his eighth and final journey to the circumpolar north---later
investigated and approved by the National Geographic Society---US
Commander R. E. Peary placed an American flag at a point on the
ice-covered Arctic Sea, somewhere nearby the earth's north geographical
pole. To commemorate this event, Peary claims to have written a note,
placed it in a glass bottle, and then hid it in an ice crevice:

> I have this day hoisted the national ensign of the United States of
> America at this place, which my observations indicate to be the North
> Polar axis of the earth, and have formally taken possession of the
> entire region, and adjacent, for and in the name of the President of
> the United States of America.

When Peary reached Indian Harbor, Newfoundland in early September 1909,
he sent President Taft a telegram:

> William H. Taft, President of the United States, Washington, D. C:
> Have honor of placing North Pole at your disposal. R. E. Peary, U. S.
> N.

In contrast to the media headlines generated by Artur Chilingarov's
titanium flag-planting, Peary's attempt to do precisely what Foreign
Minister MacKay was so against produced at least one attention-grabbing
headline in the September 9, 1909 edition of the San Francisco Call:
"Taft Does not Want Pole." Indeed, in partial response to Peary's
generous offer, President Taft replied, "Thanks for your interesting and
generous offer. I do not know exactly what I could do with it." Of
course, there is an even more recent example of the United States
flirting with the possibility of buying US sovereignty further into the
Arctic. Not only in 1946 did the US propose to pay Denmark \$100 million
to buy Greenland, but according to National Public Radio, "No Joke:
Trump Really Does Want to Buy Greenland" (NPR, August 19, 2019).

Although Greenland and Denmark made it clear to President Trump that
Greenland was not an empty lot with a "For sale" sign, Trump's fumbled
attempt at a real estate deal did further highlight that the Arctic is
increasingly viewed by some observers as an arena for geopolitical
competition. It further drew attention to the fact that the Trump
Administration has been slow to turn its attention to the Arctic region.
Consequently, the Department of Defense and the Navy each recently
issued Arctic strategy documents. And not only did the Coast Guard
produce its own Arctic strategy document, but to augment its two
operational polar icebreakers, the US Senate finally approved in summer
2019---after a two-decade delay---the Coast Guard's request for funding
to acquire the first of three planned new polar icebreakers. Although
the acquisition of new icebreakers is clearly intended to defend and
protect US interests in the Arctic, it is critical to note that the
Coast Guard's icebreakers are deliberately called "polar" because they
operate in both the Arctic and Antarctic. Further, a significant
proportion of icebreaker activities are conducted in support of the
National Science Foundation's (NSF) research activities in both polar
regions. Thus, it is problematic to distinguish actual new White House
policies from existing nor to identify statements made by President
Trump concerning the Arctic. Perhaps the clearest---if
unrevealing---statement offered by Trump on the Arctic was delivered
after his meeting with the Finnish president on April 23, 2018: "Both
leaders affirmed that it is essential to increase security in the
Arctic."

Although the Arctic has not been a high priority for the current
president, as in other international policy domains his administration
has nonetheless applied an uncooperative "America First" approach to
interactions with both allies and competitors. Such an unnuanced
strategy to international relations has led to uneven results and has
even caused uneasiness between the United States and Canada, its
principal Arctic partner. Although former Vice President Biden, Trump's
democratic rival in the approaching November 2020 presidential election,
has offered sharp criticism of President Trump's "America First"
approach, he has not yet clearly outlined how his administration would
work with Arctic state and non-state stakeholders. What is known,
however, is that **[the major global challenge of [climate change can
only be solved if countries cooperate]{.mark} with each other and reject
isolationism]{.underline}**. What is also clear is that [should
[Biden's]{.mark} bid to become America's 46th president be successful,
his [foreign policy]{.mark} priorities [would]{.mark} include
[re-build]{.mark}ing **[trust]{.mark} and unity among US partners while
[pursu]{.mark}ing [cooperation with]{.mark} its perceived [rivals
on]{.mark} issues where interests converge, which notably includes
[climate change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, Biden was among the
first US politicians to propose a climate change bill in the Senate:
More than three decades ago, Biden introduced the Global Climate
Protection Act of 1986. More recently, [Biden spoke]{.underline} in
January 2020 [on the importance of protecting the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge from oil and gas drilling and
development]{.underline}---a clear contrast with Trump's attempts to
encourage more fossil fuel production in Alaska.

The [increasing economic and strategic importance of the circumpolar
north requires more attention from US federal policymakers]{.underline}.
The Trump administration's neglect of Arctic policy has implications
beyond---but obviously including---the extended Arctic region. As
provocatively expressed in the Valdai Discussion Club's June 10, 2020
concept paper, "[The 'Arctic triangle' is emerging, consisting of the
USA, Russia and China, whose capabilities, ambitions and diplomatic
potential will **determine the future development of the Arctic
region**]{.underline}." **[[Strengthening "Arctic]{.mark} Triangle"
[relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**---and relations among all Arctic,
near-Arctic, and non-Arctic stakeholders more
generally---[[requires]{.mark} promoting possibilities where [**mutual
interests**]{.mark} can be developed]{.underline}; ensuring
international laws and institutions will continue to be respected; and
maintaining a peaceful and stable environment that is attractive to
investors and protects indigenous communities. **[[Despite disagreements
over NATO]{.mark}'s potential role in the Arctic]{.underline}**, the
inclusion of non-Arctic states in Arctic governance, and the place of
indigenous peoples in circumpolar decision making, **[both
[Russia]{.mark} and China [maintain respect for regional
governance]{.mark} structures [and]{.mark} international [institutions,
in]{.mark} particular [the Arctic]{.mark} Council]{.underline}**.
[Whether [through]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}Trump's benign neglect,
or President [[Biden]{.mark}'s application of Obama era Arctic
policies]{.underline}---and despite the National Geographic and other
news media's continued call for an "Arctic Cold War"---[[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will]{.mark} also continue to [respect
regional governance]{.mark} structures and international institutions,
and to pursue cooperation in the Arctic.]{.underline}
