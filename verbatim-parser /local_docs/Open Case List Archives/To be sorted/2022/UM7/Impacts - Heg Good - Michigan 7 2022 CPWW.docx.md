kav

Welcome and good afternoon.

I want to thank all of you for joining me here today when I know how
very busy all of you are.

[Last Spring, Secretary Blinken set out the **[Biden]{.mark}-Harris
Administration['s vision]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **a foreign
[policy]{.mark}** [that **leads with**]{.mark} **[diplomacy]{.mark},
revitalizes our global network of [alliances]{.mark} to meet emerging
global challenges, [and delivers for the]{.mark} American
[people]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is a vison, as the Secretary noted,
that springs from two fundamental principles: [that **[American
leadership]{.mark} and engagement** [matters]{.mark}, and those
countries need to engage and cooperate, now [more than
ever]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is the role of the State Department -- and
America's diplomats and development workers -- to engage around the
world and build that cooperation.

Today, I am happy to be here to present my priorities as Under Secretary
of Arms Control and International Security; known inside of the State
Department as 'T.'

The ideas I list today are in light of the many changes that we see in
the international security landscape. I chose today to present my
priorities, just as we mark the 50th Anniversary of the signing of the
Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I) in 1972. To me, it is a
humbling reminder that [even as we face monumental international
security challenges today, our predecessors prevailed through the power
of diplomacy]{.underline}. In everything we do, we will look not only to
make progress on short-term problems, but also to address their root
causes and lay the groundwork for our long-term strength.

I should note that while I am presenting these ideas, adjustments will
be made as we continue to better understand the changes that are taking
place and the security environment around us settles. [Little did we
know last year at the beginning of the Biden Administration that Putin
would invade Ukraine. Things are continuing to change on a large
scale.]{.underline}

[[Some of today's **arms control and international security landscape**
remains the same]{.underline}, [such as the DPRK]{.underline}]{.mark}['s
insistence on advancing its unlawful **weapons of mass destruction
[and]{.mark} ballistic missile programs** and refusing to engage in
diplomacy. The future of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),
still the most viable option to prevent [Iran]{.mark} from developing a
nuclear weapon, remains unclear. We remain strongly committed to our
efforts regarding both the DPRK and the JCPOA. In the meantime, there
are other changes -- like Russia's brutal and **unprovoked war in
Ukraine** and the growing challenges posed by the People's Republic of
China (PRC) -- that present us with many more questions than
answers.]{.underline}

Now is the time to consider a new way to address what are new
challenges. Russia's unprovoked invasion has led us to consider what
gaps now exist. What does the new landscape mean for us and the issues
within T such as arms control, deterrence, nonproliferation, security
assistance, and emerging technologies? [The People's Republic of China
is also posing new challenges in many areas of our
responsibility.]{.underline} How do we address those challenges?
[Technology is advancing, as are the opportunities and challenges posed
by an increased interest in space, while at the same time, climate
change and resource limitations can lead to conflict if not
addressed]{.underline}. [We need to focus on the headlines of today,
while keeping an eye on the trendlines for the challenges to
come.]{.underline}

The T Family is comprised of three Bureaus: The Bureau of Arms Control,
Verification, and Compliance, the Bureau of International Security and
Nonproliferation, and the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. It is my
honor to lead these Bureaus and work closely with their leadership to
use our diplomatic engagements and programs and when needed, sanctions
and other pressure, working with the interagency, to implement these
priorities of mine.

Let me give you a preview. I have nine priorities. They are as follows:

Fortify Arms Control, Nonproliferation, Disarmament, and Related
Activities

Reimagine Security Sector Governance (SSG) and Security Assistance

Address Emerging Technologies from a National Security Perspective

Protect and promote the U.S. and Allies Technological, Military, and
Economic Advantages

Promote, protect, and advance the U.S. Civil -- Nuclear Industry

Strengthen Existing Alliances and Partnerships and Establish New
Partnerships

Building the "T Family Brain Trust" to Address New and Emerging
Challenges to International Security

Examine "New" Areas of Conflict in International Security

Strengthen and Amplify the T Bureaus

The three T Bureaus are developing or will develop a way forward on
these priorities, including new priorities I have asked them to
incorporate. While these are my priorities, I note that [all of the work
of [the Bureaus are important]{.mark} to the **U.S. and [to
international security]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Priority One: Fortify Arms Control, Nonproliferation, Disarmament, and
Related Activities

[[The T Family]{.mark} [will]{.mark} continue to [engage the
international community in]{.mark} **strengthening existing [arms
control]{.mark}, [nonprolif]{.mark}eration, [and]{.mark}
[disarmament]{.mark} regimes, and related activities,** including in
light of recent challenges to those regimes. This includes, where
possible, meaningful engagements and dialogues with Russia and the
People's Republic of China.]{.underline}

I have worked in the areas of arms control, nonproliferation, and
disarmament for 30 years and I can say that [arms control remains as
important today as it ever was]{.underline}. While there have certainly
been challenges to and violations of international arms control
agreements by a handful of countries, arms control is not dead as some
would like you to believe. [Arms control remains an important means to
increase allied and global security by reducing risk and enhancing
stability.]{.underline} The importance of arms control will also grow as
we face competitors pursuing reckless and destabilizing buildups of
their nuclear forces combined with opaque, nontransparent nuclear use
doctrines. However, progress can only be made in a situation of
de-escalation, not escalation. [In all cases, we need willing partners
sitting across and around the table.]{.underline}

We remain committed to the implementation of New START and eventually
getting back to the table to continue the dialogue on laying the
groundwork for future arms control and to the pursuit of follow-on
measures to the New START treaty. As you know, following Russia's
unprovoked and brutal war of aggression against Ukraine, we have
suspended our Strategic Stability Dialogue (SSD). That said, the issues
that have been laid out prior to Russia's further invasion of Ukraine
are even more important now. In that respect, we want to sustain limits
on the Russian systems covered under New START beyond 2026, limit the
new kinds of nuclear weapons Russia has fielded or is developing, and
address all nuclear weapons including Russian non-strategic nuclear
weapons.

We must also be flexible as we consider the ways in which we pursue risk
reduction and future arms control measures. We will be looking at the
different types of forms these efforts can take, including but not be
limited to a traditional approach of focusing on negotiating treaties.
The way forward in this new international security landscape may be in
the form of initiatives like the U.S. voluntary commitment not to
conduct destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) missile testing
recently announced by Vice President Harris, or codes of conduct, or
best practices. We can see from the current crisis that the security
environment remains complex and is becoming more complex[. There is no
single, elegant solution to managing nuclear or other 21st century
risks. [The U.S.]{.mark} is prepared to be creative in finding ways
forward and partnering with others to make the world safer. That is what
being a leader in arms control is about.]{.underline}

On nuclear disarmament, [we [remain committed to a **world without
nuclear weapons**]{.mark} in the context of **enhancing international
security overall.**]{.underline} While our concerns about the ability of
the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) to achieve its
goals have not changed, we remain committed to engaging in pragmatic
efforts to pursue effective measures related to nuclear disarmament.
This includes work conducted by the International Partnership for
Nuclear Disarmament Verification (IPNDV), the Creating an Environment
for Nuclear Disarmament (CEND), the Stockholm Initiative for Nuclear
Disarmament, and the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Initiative (NPDI),
with whom we work closely.

We support the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and will
work to achieve its entry force while maintaining our moratorium on
nuclear explosive testing. We also continue to seek negotiations on a
cut-off in the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons
or other nuclear explosive devices and call on all relevant countries to
join us in declaring and maintaining a moratorium on such production. We
will also continue to work with our P5 colleagues, circumstances
permitting, to strengthen the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and
its three pillars. The U.S. assumes coordination of the P5 Process in
June, and we hope to build on previous efforts. The recent P5 statement
on the prevention of nuclear war is a good example of the important work
we can do together; we must hold each other to those commitments.

We will put renewed focus on these efforts and now that travel
restrictions have lifted, we are looking at when we can meet face to
face with partners in these forums and discuss ways to move ahead,
especially taking into account how the Kremlin's further invasion of
Ukraine has impacted the landscape of that work. Indeed, Russia's
nuclear saber-rattling only underscores the importance of preserving the
record of non-use of nuclear weapons.

Our Bureaus will also continue to lead efforts to maximize support for
enhanced verification capabilities throughout [the U.S. government by
partnering with the interagency, academia, the scientific community,
non-Governmental Organizations, private industry, and
others.]{.underline}

There are other new challenges that require continued attention. [**The
People's Republic of [China]{.mark} (PRC**) [is]{.mark} **rapidly
[building]{.mark}** up [a **larger**]{.mark}**, more diverse [nuclear
arsenal]{.mark}.** The accelerating pace of the PRC's nuclear expansion
may enable it to have up to **700 nuclear warheads by 2027**. The PRC
likely intends to have at least 1,**000 warheads by 2030**, exceeding
the estimated size that the United States projected just two years ago
in 2020.]{.underline}

As I noted in my speech last year at the NATO Weapons of Mass
Destruction (WMD) Conference, and it remains true to this day, the U.S.
continues to request that the PRC be more transparent about the purpose
and direction of its nuclear strategy. There is currently no formal
dialogue between our governments on this subject, and limited tools are
available to mitigate risk and prevent crisis escalation with the PRC.
[We will continue to seek engagement with appropriate PRC officials on
risk reduction.]{.underline}

As you know, [the **Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty Review Conference,
or NPT** RevCon, will at long last take place in August in New
York]{.underline}. With the Russian government's reckless and
destabilizing rhetoric, it is more important now than ever for all
States Parties to reaffirm the importance of the nuclear
nonproliferation regime and recommit to its goals. The August NPT RevCon
provides an opportunity to do that. [While [the U.S.]{.mark} recognizes
the challenges that Russia's actions pose to the NPT, we [will
emphasize]{.mark} **practical [actions]{.mark}** responsible nuclear
powers can take [to reduce nuclear risks and pursue]{.mark} a
**realistic path on arms control and [disarmament]{.mark}**, and to
ensure that all NPT Parties can realize its full benefits.]{.underline}
The RevCon presents an opportunity to reflect both on how much has been
accomplished and on what can and must be done to preserve and extend
that progress. [[The NPT remains instrumental in limiting the risk of
nuclear war]{.mark} by avoiding a cascade of nuclear proliferation and
laying the groundwork for progress on disarmament.]{.underline}

[[The U.S. will]{.mark} use the Review Conference **to [promote]{.mark}
its objectives in all three of the NPT's pillars** -- the areas of
nonproliferation and [strengthened safeguards, peaceful uses of nuclear
energy, and nuclear disarmament]{.mark}.]{.underline} We plan to find
areas of common ground on measures to reduce the risks of nuclear war
and a positive dialogue among Nuclear Weapons States (NWS) and
Non-Nuclear Weapons States (NNWS).

[[The U.S. is]{.mark} also [committed **to**]{.mark} **the third pillar
of the NPT -- the [peaceful uses of nuclear energy, science, and
technology]{.mark}.**]{.underline} In that respect[, [the
U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} and the UK have co-led an effort to build a
multilateral deliverable, called the "Sustained Dialogue on Peaceful
Uses," to promote peaceful uses of nuclear energy, science, and
technology. The Sustained Dialogue aims to integrate non-traditional
stakeholders in the NPT process to promote broader acceptance of
peaceful uses as a solution to development challenges and to create a
lasting framework that better captures peaceful use assistance as a
dividend of the NPT. It provides a benefit of the NPT that often gets
overshadowed by political debates on nuclear disarmament and
nonproliferation.

Here, I want to thank my colleagues, Ambassador Adam Scheinman, Special
Representative of the President for Nuclear Nonproliferation, for his
leadership as we prepare for the NPT Review Conference, and for the work
that former Assistant Secretary Tom Countryman has accomplished since he
agreed to return to us and assist in this process.

We also see the Review Conference as an opportunity to recognize the
continued need for a strong International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
and its work on safeguards, safety, and security. [The IAEA has been
doing significant work in the area of peaceful uses as well as in other
areas of concern, including convening the recent first Review Conference
of the Amended Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear
Materials, its work on **cybersecurity, on nuclear law, and in other
areas.**]{.underline} Strong U.S. leadership on nonproliferation will
also involve continuing to promote the combination of an IAEA
Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement and an Additional Protocol (AP) as
the de facto international standard for verifying that nuclear material
is not diverted from peaceful uses. This year marks the 25th anniversary
of the AP, and so now is the time to reinvigorate our efforts in support
of its universal adoption. [We will also reiterate our support for the
negotiation of a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty (FMCT) and for all
states to halt production of fissile material for use in nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}

Moving on to the other important areas in priority one, there is a
renewed focus on the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). As I noted at
the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva last year, for the past two
decades, efforts to strengthen the Convention have been treading water.
States Parties have been unable to agree to significant action. We face
a biological weapons threat that is real and, in many respects, growing.
Some states continue to possess sophisticated, well-established
biological weapons programs, while non-state actors have shown
continuing interest in acquiring biological weapons capabilities.
Additionally, the widespread availability of sophisticated scientific
and technological tools and methods is gradually eroding barriers to the
development of biological weapons.

COVID-19 is a wake-up call for all of us. The astonishing human toll of
the pandemic has illustrated our shared vulnerability to novel
pathogens.

In Geneva, I noted a two-pronged approach. The Review Conference should
take near-term, concrete action to strengthen the Convention and benefit
States Parties. These actions include further operationalizing
assistance under Article VII; establishing a voluntary fund for
technical cooperation; creating a mechanism to review advances in
science and technology; deepening collaborations on biosafety and
biosecurity; staffing the Implementation Support Unit to carry out these
roles; and enabling more agile decision making. The second way forward
is for the Review Conference to take steps to address the harder issues.
It should establish a new expert working group to examine possible
measures to strengthen implementation of the Convention, increase
transparency, and enhance assurance of compliance.

I was very happy this year to appoint a new BWC Special Representative
and Deputy Special Representative to lead the government's engagements
on the BWC. I am pleased that the States Parties reached consensus to
delay the Review Conference until November, which allows time for the
newly nominated RevCon President to prepare for the meeting. Our Special
Representative Ken Ward will spend the next few months working closely
with allies and like-minded countries as we turn our broad concepts into
specific proposals.

[Along with this effort is work by my team to [enhance\[s\] biosafety
and biosecurity norms, practices, tools, and resources to bolster
cooperation]{.mark} in forums such as the **BWC, Global Partnership, and
the Global Health Security Agenda**. We will work to ensure the tools
needed to address these challenges have the attention and resources
needed to confront biological challenges. We will work to build national
capacity to mitigate biological threats.]{.underline}

Regarding the Chemical Weapons Convention or CWC, the United States is
on track to complete destruction of its chemical weapons by September
2023, and we have destroyed over 97 percent of our fully declared
stockpile. [Given the potential chemical weapons threat to Ukraine, the
United States is again leading and working closely with allies and
partners.]{.underline} I am proud of the bilateral security assistance
that the United States has provided to Ukraine, including over \$100
million in life-saving protective and detection equipment and related
medical countermeasures, in addition to funds provided to the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) that will be
used to assist Ukraine to protect against the threat of chemical
weapons.

The Bureau of Arms Control, Verification, and Compliance is also
continuing to work with the OPCW to hold Russia and Syria accountable
for their past chemical weapons use and to deter further use. We look
forward to additional OPCW reports this summer from its Investigation
and Identification Team that will identify those responsible for
chemical weapons attacks in Syria. The Bureau will continue to make
advances in chemical forensics to improve the ability of the United
States, allies, partners, and the OPCW to attribute the use of chemical
weapons. The CWC States Parties Review Conference in 2023 is another
opportunity for States Parties to reaffirm their commitment to the CWC
and its implementation. We are now considering our goals for the Review
Conference to advance its work.

In all our work, we will continue to combat disinformation against U.S.
activities and engagements.

[[The U.S. has been a leader in]{.mark} the development of
**conventional [arms control instruments]{.mark}**, including the Treaty
on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and the Vienna Document on
Confidence- and Security-Building Measures]{.underline}. Despite
Russia's war on Ukraine, we continue to see a role for conventional arms
control in the Euro-Atlantic region and beyond. This kind of arms
control can enhance mutual confidence and transparency among states and
reduce the risk of conflict. The Bureau of Arms Control, Verification,
and Compliance continues to support full compliance with existing
conventional arms control agreements and the development of new ideas
for future confidence- and security-building mechanisms, including the
modernization of the Vienna Document to reflect the new
political-military realities in Europe. It is important to have a base
of existing conventional arms control instruments that we can build on
to restore a more enduring peace.

[Moving on to fortifying related activities as I also noted in this
priority, we will enhance the role of export controls and counter
proliferation measures in preventing the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction and their delivery systems, destabilizing advanced
conventional weapons, and related technologies.]{.underline} [The
multilateral export control regimes]{.underline} -- Missile Technology
Control Regime, Nuclear Suppliers Group, Wassenaar Arrangement, and
Australia Group -- [remain important bodies through which we work with
our allies and partners to address proliferation challenges. The regimes
protect nonproliferation imperatives while providing predictability for
exporters and are the basis for preventing advanced technologies from
falling into adversarial competitors. These regimes and institutions
must adjust to the challenges in the international security landscape.
We will enhance [U.S. leadership]{.mark} in these regimes and
institutions and advance novel approaches to the challenges each regime
face.]{.underline} We will also support the important work of the Bureau
of International Security and Nonproliferation's programmatic offices
that promote adherence to the regimes' guidance and updates to the
control lists among non-member countries, thereby expanding the reach of
nonproliferation norms. In that respect, I commend you to go online and
learn more about the extensive programmatic work of the T Bureaus.

Priority Two: Reimagine Security Sector Governance (SSG) and Security
Assistance

[The T Family [will continue to promote **democracy**]{.mark}**,
transparency, and accountability** among our **allies and partners** as
we lead the Department's Security Sector Governance (SSG)
efforts]{.underline}. [This includes ensuring SSG is accounted for in a
methodical, transparent way in our arms transfer and **security
assistance decision-making**, **supported by holistic diplomatic
engagement**, **[and]{.mark} [protecting human rights]{.mark} and
civilian security**.]{.underline} SSG is about encouraging the
leadership and security institutions we partner with to provide security
to their people as a public good, rather than leveraging their power to
further the narrow interests of the elite. The T Family will reassert
the imperative of democratic principles and human rights at the center
of our nation's security assistance programs.

A fundamental aspect of this future work is to ensure that we integrate
SSG into larger issues of foreign policy. Assistance should be an
integral part of a longer, holistic, diplomatic strategy for our foreign
policy goals and approach with countries rather than be transactional.
We seek SSG integrated in a methodical, transparent way in our arms
transfer and security assistance decision-making with diplomatic
engagement.

For example, the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs will continue
providing advisory assistance through the Global Defense Reform Program
(GDRP), which seeks to improve security sector governance and
institutional capacity of select partners at the service, ministerial,
and national levels. By focusing on systems and processes, GDRP projects
aim to build the resilience of U.S. partners and their security
institutions, enhance effectiveness and accountability, and better align
the security sector to the needs and challenges of the partner nation
and its citizens.

SSG is shaped by hard lessons learned. [Americans are rightly wary of
prolonged [U.S.]{.mark} military interventions abroad]{.underline}. We
have seen how they have often come at far too high a cost, both to us
and to others. When we look back at the past decades of our military
involvement in the world, we must remember what we have learned about
the limits of force alone to build a durable peace; that the day after a
major military intervention is always harder than we imagine; and how
critical it is to pursue every possible avenue to a diplomatic solution.
Security sector assistance cannot overcome or 'fix' underlying
structural or political challenges. Rather, it must be part of a broader
effort alongside lines of effort in the areas of justice,
democratization, economic growth, countering corruption, and addressing
stakeholder equities and concerns across the political spectrum. It is
not enough to build defense institutions in tandem with "train and
equip" missions; security sector governance must be the pacesetter.

Priority Three: Address Emerging Technologies from a National Security
Perspective

As part of the Secretary's modernization efforts to address 21st Century
threats, [the T Family is important to the Department's [efforts to
address **emerging technologies**]{.mark} **from a national security
perspective**. [That includes leading efforts to prevent]{.mark} the
[prolif]{.mark}eration [of]{.mark} these technologies for purposes
related to **[w]{.mark}eapons of [m]{.mark}ass [d]{.mark}estruction,
delivery system[s]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} destabilizing advanced
conventional weapons**, **to enhance alliance military [cooperation on
these technologies]{.mark}**, and **to develop appropriate norms of
responsible behavior regarding their use.**]{.underline} T Bureaus will
enhance their work on emerging technology with new offices and
expertise.

Our Bureaus are also engaged in discussions on other threats posed by
emerging national security challenges presented by new technologies such
as artificial intelligence (AI), quantum information sciences, and
biotechnology, among others. We are looking at ways in which these
challenges can be addressed considering the changing nature of the
technology and threats posed by adversarial uses. The PRC's
Military-Civil Fusion strategy, which blurs the lines between civil and
military development, further compounds these challenges.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} risk that sensitive technologies can be
transferred via intangible means make it critical to conduct outreach to
academia and industry and ensure proper vetting of foreign visitors and
students, so they do not contribute to programs of concern.

We will work to implement related national security-focused strategies
developed by the T Bureaus and including by supporting related
Department efforts in the United Nations. [This work will focus on how
new technologies could present opportunities and risks to the security
of [U.S.]{.mark} allies and partners]{.underline}.

The T Bureaus and I will also promote the use of norms of responsible
behavior or codes of conduct when promoting risk reduction in areas of
emerging technologies such as space. AVC's Office of Emerging Security
Challenges [[has been consulting with **allies**]{.mark} **and partners
at multilateral forums** and there is broad support for this approach.
Other areas where we will seek [to advance efforts to develop norms of
responsible behavior include]{.mark} [a]{.mark}rtificial
[i]{.mark}ntelligence, [biotech]{.mark}nology, [and quantum
computing]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The U.S. is also part of the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on
emerging technologies in the area of Lethal Autonomous Weapons (LAWS)
under the auspices of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons
(CCW).]{.underline} In March 2022, the U.S. Delegation submitted a
proposal for consideration by the GGE titled "Principles and Good
Practices on Emerging Technologies in the Area of Lethal Autonomous
Weapons Systems" cosponsored by delegations from a number of other
countries. This document builds on how International Humanitarian Law
applies to LAWS and proposes additional measures that will be discussed
by the GGE in July 2022. I will continue to support this effort.

Priority Four: Protect and promote the US and Allies Technological,
Military, and Economic Advantages

[American and allied technological advancements are core elements of the
U.S. industrial strategy and President Biden's key priorities, and the T
Family will continue efforts to keep such technology and advancements
from illegal acquisition.]{.underline} As noted, we are particularly
concerned with threats posed by the PRC's Military-Civil Fusion Strategy
that will fuse together its civilian economy and defense establishment
so that advanced and emerging technologies drive economic and military
modernization simultaneously.

The T Family has led U.S. participation in the four nonproliferation
export control regimes for over 30 years and is partnering with allies
and partners in other regional and bilateral efforts as we further build
on these coalitions to protect sensitive technologies from adversarial
acquisition and exploitation.

The T Family will also continue its updates to the U.S. Munitions List,
engaging foreign governments as well as industry and university partners
at home and at abroad to bolster their understanding on how to comply
with applicable U.S. export control regulations, and strengthen allies
and partners' end-use monitoring programs for U.S. defense articles and
services.

Priority Five: Promote, protect, and advance the US Civil -- Nuclear
Industry

[[The T Family]{.mark} \[The Bureau of Arms Control, Verification, and
Compliance, the Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation,
and the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs\] [supports]{.mark} the
Department's efforts to promote **U.S. nuclear power
[alternatives]{.mark}** that support global norms of nonproliferation,
safety, and security, including traditional large nuclear power plants
and new, innovative small modular reactors, [as part of]{.mark} **the
solution to global [climate change]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The U.S. will
also continue to promote and support global norms of nonproliferation,
safety, and security, and help to protect allies and partners' critical
energy infrastructure.

The Foundational Infrastructure for the Responsible Use of Small Modular
Reactor Technology (FIRST) is one such endeavor.

[The FIRST program provides capacity-building support consistent with
the IAEA's Milestones Approach to enable partner countries to benefit
from advanced nuclear technologies and meet their clean energy goals
under the highest standards of nuclear safety, security, and
nonproliferation.]{.underline}

We will continue to seek engagements with countries through FIRST and
other efforts that build capacity under the highest international
standards and meet their energy needs.

[FIRST was one of the Presidential deliverables for the April 2021
Leaders' Summit on Climate and at the COP26 Climate Change
Conference.]{.underline} We spearheaded an announcement by Special
Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry and Romanian President Klaus
Iohannis on cooperation to build a first of a kind small modular reactor
in Romania. We have begun engagements under FIRST in recent months with
the Philippines and Ghana, and we continue to seek engagement with other
countries considering nuclear power for their clean energy needs. We
have also recently signed two Memorandum Of Understandings on nuclear
cooperation with the Philippines and Armenia.

We will also continue to engage all who are looking to take advantage of
nuclear energy's benefits to carefully consider the larger political,
economic, and strategic consequences of their choices for peaceful
nuclear energy cooperation partners, and---as countries are reminded of
the urgent security risks posed by Russia and others' energy
diplomacy---we will aim to greatly deepen cooperation and coordination
among like-minded allied and partner nuclear suppliers.

Priority Six: Strengthen Existing Alliances and Partnerships and
Establish New Partnerships

This goal connects all the other priorities. While it remains important
to strengthen our relationship with traditional allies and partners, it
is also important that we build new relationships with other countries
who also are within our national security interests. In that respect,
the T Family will enhance consultations with allies and partners and
establish dialogues with new partners to develop and deepen a shared
understanding of the changing international security environment and
thereby further national goals and objectives. We will also negotiate
security agreements to support closer cooperation.

For example, where appropriate, arms transfers and defense trade offer a
key tool to strengthening alliances and establishing new partnerships.
In the wake of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, many of Russia's
traditional security partners express concern on their own dependance on
Moscow in terms of the demonstrated performance of Russian systems in
their inventories as well as potential future difficulties obtaining
future support and sustainment. [[We will work]{.mark} with industry to
encourage countries [to diversify away from **Russia**]{.mark}**n
dependance**.]{.underline}

**[The international order is in deep trouble]{.underline}**, and not
only since the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic. [This is not how
things were supposed to turn out.]{.underline} The collapse of the "evil
empire," the end of the Cold War and the integration of Central and
Eastern Europe into the EU were supposed to bring about a new era of
stability and prosperity, the latter epitomized most prominently by
China's embrace of the market. Liberalism was supposed to reign supreme.
In the grand battle of ideas, Marx had lost out, Hegel had won --- or so
his American acolyte, Francis Fukuyama, claimed. Fukuyama proclaimed
that the "end of history" was at hand, and the cognoscenti and would-be
cognoscenti on both sides of the Atlantic enthusiastically applauded.
[Three decades later, **the world is in disarray.**]{.underline} The
attacks of September 11 were a drastic reminder that not everybody was
sold on Fukuyama's utopia. The financial crisis that followed the
collapse of Lehman Brothers and, with it, the house of cards built on a
derivatives market that had spun out of control exposed the
irrationality of rational behavior --- taking more and more risks simply
because everybody else did so. Finally, [COVID-19 has demonstrated how
quickly the]{.underline} beautiful [world of ever-expanding consumer
choices]{.underline}, sustained by cheap labor in remote parts of the
world, [can grind to a]{.underline} screeching [halt.]{.underline}
Benign Hegemon It is too early to tell whether or not global turbulences
have reached a point of no return. The prospects are not great, and that
has a lot to do with the United States. There is a strong sense that
**[America's hegemonic position]{.underline}**, which [it assumed after
World War II, **is on the wane and**, with it, **the country's
"commitment to promoting a liberal international order."**]{.underline}
Or, perhaps, the United States suffers from a severe case of "leadership
fatigue" and no longer wants to play the role of the "benign hegemon."
The notion of the benign hegemon is derived from **[hegemonic stability
theory]{.underline}**, popular among some experts in international
relations. The theory [**posits that order and stability in world
affairs crucially depend on a Great Power** capable of sustaining them
and willing to do so.]{.underline} As Stephen Kobrin, of the Wharton
School, has recently put it, "A stable, open economy requires a hegemon,
a dominant power who can provide some of the necessary public goods,
absorb costs, and order the system." Although [this
pertains]{.underline} particularly [to international economic
relations]{.underline}, it can be applied to [other areas, such as
international security. **Order and stability require**, among other
things, **that the hegemonic power formulate and underwrite the rules
that define and govern** the **interactions** between states in the
international system.]{.underline} This was the case in the second half
of the 19th century when Great Britain assumed this role, providing and
guaranteeing global public goods such as free trade, capital mobility
and the British pound, backed up by the gold standard, as the global
reserve currency. The system came to an end with [World War
I]{.underline}. The conflict [left Britain weakened]{.underline} and
largely unable to reassume its prewar role. [The interwar period was
characterized by turmoil and crises, paving the way for the rise of
autocratic regimes]{.underline}, committed to establishing a new order
on the ruins of the old one. They accomplished the latter, but the new
order was not theirs to create. The new hegemonic power that emerged
from the war was not Hitler's Germany but the United States, which
filled the void left by an exhausted Great Britain. [This was anything
but a natural transition.]{.underline} In fact, for most of the interwar
period, the United States had refused to get entangled in international
affairs. America's retreat from internationalism after World War I was
epitomized by Congress's refusal to join the League of Nations --- and
that despite the fact that the league had been the brainchild of US
President Woodrow Wilson. Isolationism went hand in hand with
protectionism. Throughout the 19th century and way into the beginning of
the 20th, the United States boasted some of the highest tariffs in the
world. The culmination was the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930,
which had a devastating impact on international trade and contributed to
the Great Depression. It was not until the United States entered the war
against Nazi Germany that it assumed the role commensurate to its
position as the economically and militarily by far strongest power in
the world. Alternative Options The failure of the most recent G20
meeting in Rome to arrive at a meaningful common position on global
warming and climate change ahead of the COP26 in Glasgow is further
proof that [the United States is no longer in a position to fill this
role.]{.underline} Instead of leading, President Joe Biden blamed China
and Russia "for any disappointment over the level of commitment by G20
leaders to fight climate change." This is not to deny that Biden has a
point. But given the enormity of the impact climate change is bound to
have on the natural environment and life on this planet, it is little
more than an exercise in passing responsibility. Biden's remark,
however, does address a serious issue, namely the role of China in a
rapidly changing world. A few weeks ago, [Chinese coal production
reached new historic highs]{.underline}, amounting to an estimated 4
billion tons for this year. Accelerated coal production is supposed to
alleviate energy shortages that have threatened to slow down the
country's growth. Unfortunately, [emissions-wise, coal happens to be one
of the worst sources of energy. **A new study on the impact of carbon
dioxide emissions** on coastal areas **predicts catastrophic
devastation**]{.underline} as a result of rising sea levels for some of
the world's megacities, particularly in India, Indonesia, Vietnam and
China --- all major coal consumers. Given the concentration of China's
population in a string of coastal cities, one might assume that it has a
particular interest in **[combating climate change]{.underline}**. In
theory, this [**would entail** an **active involvement** in global
governance]{.underline}, a proposition that China has been more than
reluctant to embrace, presumably because it would entail directly
challenging the United States. At the same time, however, China has
launched major initiatives, such as the foundation of the Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank and particularly the One Belt, One Road
initiative. Together with China's massive engagement in Africa, these
projects leave the impression that they are part of a comprehensive
drive designed to establish China as an alternative to the United
States. This might herald the emergence of a new system, no longer
dominated by one power but multipolar, and certainly very different from
the one established after World War II. For, as Princeton's John
Ikenberry has noted a few years ago, **["there is no liberal
internationalism without American and western hegemony --- and that age
is ending."]{.underline}** With the decline of the United States and the
parallel rise of China, countries have the option to "seek alternative
patrons rather than remain dependent on Western largess and support."
**[The end result might very well be a bifurcated world order, on the
heels of a period of instability and turmoil]{.underline}**, or what Ian
Bremmer and Nouriel Roubini have called a "G-Zero" world, **[one without
clear leadership and global cooperation.]{.underline}** Bifurcation
means the coexistence of competing systems that follow fundamentally
different rules. This can already be observed in the realm of economic
governance. Olga [Petricevic and]{.underline} David [Teece
have]{.underline} recently [warned of a "noticeable defiance of the
principles of classical economic liberalism and the rule-of-law" by
Russia and China.]{.underline} The Chinese "alternative model of
governance," they note, "is deploying coordinated protectionist trade
and investment policies and government intervention aimed at accessing
and acquiring foreign intellectual property, thereby influencing the
global economic and innovation system." Its success is likely to inspire
imitation and attempts to jump on the bandwagon, resulting not only in
bifurcation but in polarization reminiscent of the Cold War period.

#### US heg boosts transatlantic unity, keeps Russia and China in check, spreads democracy, and leads world peace

The war in Ukraine is a world-historical moment -- a pivotal event that
comes around maybe once every decade. Already the Russian invasion has
upended the post-Cold War European security order. However, beyond
shattering established structures, crises tend to create opportunities.
In this regard, the war in Ukraine is no different. From the standpoint
of the United States, Moscow's blatant aggression has creating an
opening to reassert its leadership of the Western alliance and even
recapture some of its post-Cold War hegemonic position, which has been
challenged by revisionist powers China and Russia and domestic
travails.\[1\] A little over six months after a chaotic exit from
Afghanistan, [**President [Biden]{.mark} and his administration**
[are]{.mark} being [hailed]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the **successful
[coordination]{.mark}** [of a]{.mark} **joint transatlantic
[response]{.mark} in sanctions [against Russia]{.mark} and military aid
to Ukraine**. Joe Biden's triumphant inaugural declaration looks
prescient: "[America is back]{.mark}".]{.underline}

However, in the midst of such triumphalism, it is vital to pause and
consider pathways forward. As the old international order receded, the
Biden administration is facing questions regarding the future direction
of America's international engagement in the "post-February 24, 2022"
world.\[2\] After briefly outlining how the Biden administration arrived
at its pivotal date with history, this article zooms in on five sets of
challenges that the U.S. needs to deal with to sustain the current
"hegemonic moment." Without attention and resolve to mitigate these
challenges, the re-emergence of U.S. leadership in the transatlantic
domain, not to mention any visions of reasserting U.S. hegemony more
broadly, may prove but a flash in the pan.

From Relief to Trepidation and Back Again

In Europe and within the U.S. alliance network more broadly, the Biden
presidency was greeted by and large with a sense of relief. After four
years on Donald Trump's America First rollercoaster, transatlantic
relations would -- so the logic went -- give way to a smoother ride.
[For America's friends and allies, Joe [Biden was a]{.mark} known
quantity, an **experienced [foreign policy leader]{.mark}** with
transatlanticism and alliance solidarity near his heart; a stark
contrast to Trump's unilateralist and transactionalist tendencies.\[3\]
[Biden]{.mark}'s team [articulated a willingness to reassume **America's
place**]{.mark} **at the relevant tables [of]{.mark} international
politics** to "earn back \[... its\] **[leadership]{.mark}
position**".\[4\]]{.underline}

Relatedly, [the leadership role the U.S. has presently assumed remains
in **stark contrast** to how the Trump administration dealt with the
Covid-19 pandemic, shutting borders, hoarding medical supplies, and
engaging in vaccine nationalism.]{.underline}

In the context of these high expectations, the first year of the Biden
administration was a disappointment for many on the old continent. There
were, of course, early successes. The U.S. decision to re-enter the
Paris Climate Agreement and return to the fold at the World Health
Organization (WHO) were greeted with applause by many in Europe. The
President's "feel-good tour" of the old continent in June produced
pledges of support for the EU and NATO as well as headline-grabbing
developments like the B3W (Build Back Better World) infrastructure
initiative and a deal on the 17-year-old EU-U.S. dispute over airline
subsidies.\[5\]

However, dark clouds were brewing on the horizon. The U.S. had already
failed in consulting its European allies on the decision to withdraw
U.S. troops from Afghanistan, ultimately taken in mid-April. The chaotic
exit from the country in August, on the heels of a surprising Taliban
takeover, led observers to question U.S. reliability and credibility and
the Biden administration's policy competence.\[6\]

The Afghanistan debacle was followed in short order by an announcement
of a security pact by the U.S., UK, and Australia, dubbed AUKUS. The
arrangement would grant Australia access to nuclear propulsion
technology for its submarines. In the process, the French -- the one EU
member with ambitions of a sustained security footprint in the
Indo-Pacific -- lost out on a lucrative \$66 billion deal to build
diesel-powered submarines for Australia. In the ensuing dust-up between
the U.S. and France, Paris even called home its ambassador to the United
States.\[7\]

After these debacles, Russia's maximalist calls to renegotiate the
European security architecture and build-up of forces around Ukraine
provided the Biden administration with an opportunity for a
transatlantic reset after a challenging year. By airing intelligence
findings about Russian troop movements and intelligence regarding the
Kremlin's plans, [the [U.S. eroded Moscow]{.mark}'s **ability to rely on
the element of surprise**. Just as importantly, [the U.S. took the lead
in diplomacy]{.mark} before Russia shut the door on such endeavors with
its invasion on 24 February 2022]{.underline}.\[8\]

Because of astute diplomacy and coordination in the weeks leading up to
the invasion, the U.S. and the EU were swift in responding with punitive
sanctions and have been able to up the ante as the Russian attack has
continued. The provision of Western military aid to Ukraine has also
been a joint transatlantic undertaking, and despite some public spats,
such as over the fate of Polish MiG-29 fighter jets, the effort has
allowed Ukraine to inflict considerable damage upon the invading forces.
Meanwhile, NATO is bolstering its defenses on the Eastern flank and has
regained a sense of purpose. In the span of less than three months,
[[doubts over]{.mark} **U.S. [credibility]{.mark}** [have been
traded]{.mark} in [for **celebrations of transatlantic
unity**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}\[9\] Yet the war in Ukraine still
raises several open questions about the future role of the United States
in the world writ large and the shape of the transatlantic relationship
in the coming years. Five sets of challenges appear particularly
pertinent, namely, making most of the transatlantic unity, selling the
U.S. and Western approach globally, engaging in two-theatre great-power
competition, finding a balance between safeguarding democracy, and
dealing with autocracies, and, last but not least, finding domestic
backing for a sustainable foreign policy line.

Cashing in on Transatlantic Unity

[**[The]{.mark} pronounced [unity]{.mark} on sanctions against Russia**
[and]{.mark} the steady stream of **weapons deliveries and humanitarian
[assistance to Ukraine]{.mark}** speak volumes for the
**[reinvigorated]{.mark} strength of [the]{.mark} transatlantic
[bond]{.mark}**. Even Germany has gone against the grain of its
strategic culture]{.underline}, pledging a €100 billion increase in
defense spending and endeavoring to meet NATO's 2-percent-of-GDP
military spending target.\[10\] Declared "brain dead" by French
President Emmanuel Macron in 2019,\[11\] NATO has found a new sense of
purpose, and is now debating the entry of two new members: Finland and
Sweden. Both countries possess a long history of military non-alignment,
robust democratic credentials and relatively strong militaries.\[12\] In
fact, the entry of these two Nordic countries to NATO enjoys broad
support within the alliance, and bipartisan support in Congress.\[13\]
Such seismic shifts would have been unimaginable at the beginning of the
year, let alone in the Trump era.

Yet, barring a leadership change in the Kremlin or a drastic Russian
policy shift, a long era of "neo-containment" beckons on the
continent.\[14\] After years of uncertainty over the future direction of
the Western alliance, [the **[U.S. commitment]{.mark}** to the
**transatlantic relationship** [seems secure]{.mark}]{.underline}, at
least for the time being. The U.S. has, for instance, increased its
troop presence in Europe from 60 000 to 100 000 after the Russian
invasion, alongside its material support for Ukraine.\[15\] In the long
run, however, the future American military presence and shape of NATO's
deterrence posture on the old continent will depend on how the war in
Ukraine ultimately plays out. The extent to which Russia's military
capabilities can be further degraded in Ukraine and the ability of
either the Ukrainians or Russians to achieve successes on the
battlefield before a negotiated solution or a stalemate are just two
vital vectors that will impact contingency planning.

Whether the U.S. can cash in on its allies' manifest willingness to
invest more in defense is an even broader question[. Europeans are
finally answering a call for more equitable burden-sharing that U.S.
administrations have been making for decades.]{.underline} At the same
time, however, the transatlantic relationship has always presented
Washington D.C. with a dilemma. [The ability of the U.S. to influence
its allies has depended on an asymmetry of power between the two sides
of the Atlantic.]{.underline} At the same time, a more capable and
autonomous Europe would likely be less willing to follow Washington's
lead.\[16\] This mode of thought has historically been at the core of
D.C. insiders' gripes regarding European strategic autonomy. Going
forward, U.S. policymakers would need to drop such antiquated views in
favor of a more approach to transatlantic security, one where the U.S.
views European capacity building as positive progress regardless of the
framework wherein such developments take place.\[17\] A more capable
Europe would not only assume more responsibility for the continent's
security, but free up U.S. resources for use elsewhere around the globe.
A stronger Europe thus makes for a better -- even if at times more
independent-minded -- partner. Here the Europeans' manifest demand for
sustained U.S. hegemony and calls for strategic autonomy need not be
irreconcilable.

A Worrying Global Context

While European solidarity has been on display in media headlines, and
the U.S.' traditional allies in the Indo-Pacific have been supportive, a
prominent chunk of the world does not share the American and European
understanding of the war.\[18\] Nor are they willing to take measures to
sanction Russia either symbolically or materially. When the UN General
Assembly voted to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council on 7
April 2022, 93 members voted for the resolution, but 24 voted against
and 58 abstained. Notable abstainers included India, Brazil, South
Africa, Mexico, Malaysia, Indonesia, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia. Vietnam,
which the U.S. has sought to woo in recent years, voted against.\[19\]
In the Middle East, the U.S.' traditional partners have refused to pump
more oil into the market amidst soaring energy prices.\[20\] Meanwhile,
despite U.S. courtship of India in the Quad framework, New Delhi
continues to balance American demands and its historical relationship
with Moscow.\[21\] Testament to the difficulty of selling the West's
message in the global south, South African President Cyril Ramophosa has
blamed NATO enlargement for the outbreak of the war.\[22\]

The world remains a messy place, and [the ability of the U.S. to counter
**Chinese or Russian influence** globally hinges on the U.S.' ability to
work pragmatically with regimes that possess few democratic
credentials.]{.underline}

From the U.S. and Europe standpoint, this lack of support from outside
the traditional West is a problem. Although the hegemony of the U.S.
dollar makes going against its sanctions difficult,\[23\] how the U.S.,
EU, and their allies have managed to shut Russia out of the global
economy is a warning sign to other potential targets of sanctions.
Therefore, the war could hasten movement away from the dollar and euro
as reserve currencies, eroding the future efficacy of sanctions.\[24\]
Relatedly, the leadership role the U.S. has presently assumed remains in
stark contrast to how the Trump administration dealt with the Covid-19
pandemic, shutting borders, hoarding medical supplies, and engaging in
vaccine nationalism.\[25\] While Covid vaccinations have progressed with
vigor in the West, vaccination rates are lagging in the global south.
There is a stark contrast between the U.S. Congress approving a \$40
billion package to support Ukraine, and its inability to agree on
sufficient funding for the global vaccination drive.\[26\] In this vein,
what might appear as newfound U.S. leadership in the West, can easily be
construed as yet another manifestation of American and Western hypocrisy
elsewhere.\[27\]

Competing on Two Fronts

In the process of upending the European security architecture,
[[the]{.mark} **Ukraine [crisis]{.mark}** [has thrown the U.S.
into]{.mark} the center of [a]{.mark} "**two-front great-power
[competition]{.mark}"**]{.underline}.\[28\] At the start of the Biden
presidency, there were few areas of bipartisan consensus in Washington
D.C., but [the imperative of engaging China in **great-power
competition** came close]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} incoming
[admin]{.mark}istration [recognized China as a priority]{.mark} over
other security challenges, including Russia.]{.underline} In fact, there
was little discernible change beyond rhetorical nuance from the Trump
administration when it came to China policy. The Biden team kept
Trump-era tariffs in place, and despite a joint U.S.-China pledge made
at the COP26 summit, competition has been the order of the day. Joe
Biden's recent statements indicating U.S. willingness to defend Taiwan
against a Chinese attack -- which would be a departure from decades of
"strategic ambiguity" -- underline how the [U.S.' China policy's tides
have shifted in the span of two presidential
administrations.]{.underline}\[29\]

When it came to Russia, [the initial intention of the administration was
to manage the relationship so that the U.S. could finally reorient
towards the Indo-Pacific]{.underline} -- although there was no
expectation of an actual "reset" with Moscow. Although the June meeting
between Biden and Putin in Geneva appeared to pave the way for more
predictable relations initially, [Russia's decision to pursue **regional
revanchism** in Ukraine has laid any such plans to rest]{.underline}.
[The success of Ukraine in withstanding the Russian onslaught, [with the
help of]{.mark} **Western weapons deliveries**, has also enabled [the
U.S.]{.mark} to reframe its approach towards the Kremlin. In the words
of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, the U.S. "want\[s\] to see [Russia
weakened]{.mark} to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things it
has done in invading Ukraine]{.underline}".\[30\] This shift towards
degrading [Russia's capacity is reflected in the investments the U.S. is
willing to make to support Ukraine's cause]{.underline}. These assets
have broad bipartisan support, as manifested in the recent \$40 billion
bill that passed with comprehensive bipartisan support in both houses.
\[31\]

To further complicate matters, just weeks before Russia embarked on its
military adventure, Xi Jinping met Vladimir Putin at the Beijing Winter
Olympics, and the two states released a statement asserting their
friendship had "no limits". While China has refrained from directly
supporting Russia with military equipment, it has not condemned the
invasion or gone along with Western sanctions, instead looking to
benefit from cheaper Russian energy. While the Russia-China relationship
is hardly a happy marriage, Beijing's reaction proves it does not want
to lose a partner who shares its distaste for American hegemony.\[32\]
China is therefore unlikely to forsake Moscow, at least for the
foreseeable future.\[33\]

The key question going forward is how the United States intends to
maintain such a two-theatre posture in the great game of the 21st
century. Obviously, this is a question of attaining and allocating the
necessary resources to sustain such an approach, whether in terms of
troops or materiel. Critics of the U.S. approach to Ukraine have already
pointed out that the rejuvenated focus on the European theatre is a
distraction, and the "U.S. Should \[...\] husband its critical resources
for the primary fight in Asia".\[34\] Regardless of the constellation of
capabilities [[the U.S.]{.mark} can muster for each theatre, the role of
allies will be magnified, [requiring]{.mark} **astute [relationship
management]{.mark}** from the United States **[in]{.mark} marrying [the
concerns and capabilities]{.mark}** [of its]{.mark} **European and
Indo-Pacific [allies and partners]{.mark}**.\[35\] This will be no mean
feat, given the **different threat perceptions and security concerns**
of U.S. friends across the globe.]{.underline}

Dilemmas of Democracy and Autocracy

[President [Biden]{.mark} has [linked]{.mark} **strategic
[competition]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} a broader contest between
**[democracy and autocracy]{.mark}**. For him **safeguarding democracy**
is "the defining challenge of our time."\[36\] To underline U.S.
commitment to bolster **democracy worldwide**, the President fulfilled a
campaign pledge by hosting the first ever Summit for
Democracy]{.underline} in December 2021, albeit to little fanfare. While
this narrative of the competition as a struggle between systems of
governance plays to audiences at home and in the West writ large, it may
actually operate in the converse direction in the rest of the world.
Branding states as laggards is not ideal for enticing them into
cooperation.\[37\] [The world remains a messy place, and the ability of
the U.S. to counter **Chinese or Russian influence globally** hinges on
the U.S.' ability to work pragmatically with regimes that possess few
democratic credentials]{.underline}.

This dilemma has been on full display in the aftermath of Russia's
attack on Ukraine. In its search for softening the spike in energy
prices, the Biden administration has reached out to Saudi Arabia and its
controversial crown prince Mohammed bin Salman and oil-rich Venezuela, a
state under severe U.S. economic sanctions.\[38\] The current crisis has
also opened up opportunities for authoritarian states to haggle with the
hegemon. The opposition of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to
Finland's and Sweden's NATO membership, for instance, can be seen as a
not-so-subtle ploy to obtain concessions from the U.S.\[39\] Of course,
making deals and cultivating strategic relationships with unsavory
regimes were part of [the American toolbox in the bipolar competition of
the Cold War and during the global "War on Terror."]{.underline} [The
difficult task of balancing between the desire for bolstering democracy
and the **imperative of safeguarding U.S. interests** will certainly
remain at the heart of U.S. international engagement for decades to
come]{.underline}.\[40\]

Domestic Concerns and Presidential Wildcards

The Trump era illustrated that the ability of the U.S. to sustain a
globally engaged foreign policy is intimately tied to domestic politics.
Trump consistently questioned the value of U.S. alliances and
partnerships, was suspicious of multilateral institutions and opposed to
free trade, and showed blatant disregard for democratic norms at home
and abroad.\[41\] [This "**[America First]{.mark}" foreign policy
approach** [undercut **U.S. influence** ]{.mark}**globally** as it
pulled out of critical institutions and eroded allies' and partners'
trust in U.S. security guarantees and America's willingness to provide
global public goods.]{.underline}\[42\] Doubts about the U.S. persisted
throughout the Trump presidency, even though day-to-day U.S. diplomatic
engagement and military cooperation with allies and partners remained
intact, and the administration made substantial investments in its
alliances, for instance in the auspices of the European Deterrence
Initiative (EDI).\[43\] Trump's rise to the presidency would not have
been possible without the extreme polarization and hyperpartisanship
that plagues American politics and the wariness of American voters
regarding an active foreign policy. Despite Joe Biden's pledges to unify
the American people,\[44\] there are few signs of these phenomena
abating. The world is thus justifiably holding its breath in
anticipation of the 2024 presidential election.

It is unclear whether the war in Ukraine has created the conditions that
will forestall a drastic foreign policy shift if a Republican candidate
takes the White House in 2024. Admittedly, on Capitol Hill, the
Republican party has, by and large, sought to portray itself as tough on
Russia, creating an air of bipartisanship on the issue. The same goes
for supporting building up NATO defenses on the Eastern flank or for the
alliance's open-door policy, particularly Finnish and Swedish NATO
accession. At the same time, however, some Trumpian politicians and
pundits have questioned the rationale of supporting Ukraine. Trump
himself made headlines in the lead-up to the Russian invasion by
praising Putin.\[45\]

Of course, beyond questions related to European security, Trump or a
Trump-like President would likely retain the core parameters of **[the
"America First" foreign policy approach]{.underline}**. [This would
entail wariness regarding international institutions, a dogged focus on
competition with China and resistance towards multilateralism and free
trade]{.underline}. Even in the event of Democrats holding the White
House, these tropes will continue to impact foreign policy. This is
clear in the remarkable continuity between the China policies of the
Trump and Biden administrations and Biden's "Foreign Policy for the
Middle Class".\[46\] This entailed a pronounced focus on domestic
initiatives during Biden\'s first year, including the \$ 1 trillion
bipartisan infrastructure bill and the initially \$3.5 trillion Build
Back Better framework, which never made it through Congress. In
addition, the Biden administration has made little substantial progress
on trade agreements, which has left it engaging China in great-power
competition "with one hand tied behind its back" -- much to the chagrin
of its allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific.\[47\]

[It has been a bumpy year for the restraint coalition]{.underline} ---
that loose network of analysts, advocates and politicians calling for a
[sharply **reduced US role** in the world.]{.underline} Having reached
peak influence with the withdrawal from Afghanistan, this group
initially found itself marginalized by Russia's war in Ukraine. Now, the
[restraint crowd is offering a renewed critique of US policy, one that
will]{.underline} probably [prove to be]{.underline} persistent, though
[**not persuasive**.]{.underline} Restraint is a broad church. It
features anti-interventionist academics, who often style themselves as
non-ideological "realists," alongside well-funded think tanks such as
the Quincy Institute. It includes libertarians such as Senator Rand Paul
who deplore the financial costs of US foreign policy and progressives
who contend that American globalism is a cover for imperialism and
neoliberalism. There are pacifists who believe that all wars are
criminal, as well as nationalists such as Senator Josh Hawley who argue
that being appropriately hawkish on China requires being more dovish on
nearly everything else. [Some restrainers seek wholesale global
retrenchment; others mainly decry ongoing US involvement in Europe and
the Middle East. What unites them is a conviction that the overuse of US
power has been catastrophic for America and the world. This coalition
seemed ascendant a year ago, when President Joe Biden denounced the
"forever wars" while pulling out of Afghanistan.]{.underline} That
decision, two analysts argued, marked Biden as a hard-nosed realist ---
[and perhaps an ally in the struggle to reshape American
diplomacy.]{.underline} [Yet the moment **didn't last**. The collapse of
the Afghan state even before the US finished withdrawing showed that,
while waging wars is expensive, losing them can impose a **serious
cost**. Then came Russia's assault on Ukraine. As Vladimir Putin's
forces sought to restore the Soviet empire and murdered Ukrainian
citizens, they revealed just **how awful** a world shaped by great
powers other than Washington might be.]{.underline} Indeed, Biden isn't
getting much praise from self-proclaimed realists today. [While refusing
to intervene militarily, Biden has otherwise backed Ukraine with money,
weapons and other support.]{.underline} NATO --- whose peaceful
expansion allegedly forced Putin to order a campaign of aggression and
murder --- now appears likely to add two new members, Finland and
Sweden. [Biden has even invoked the rhetorical legacy of his cold war
predecessors, declaring that Ukraine is a vital front in the struggle to
save the free world.]{.underline} In response, the restraint coalition
has itself opened a new front, finding multiple reasons to attack
Biden's Ukraine policy. First is cost. Sustaining a medium-sized country
under a ferocious military assault is fantastically expensive. The
latest US support package for Ukraine totals some \$40 billion ---
money, Hawley complained, that could be better spent on giving US
military personnel a generous raise. Some Republicans in Congress seem
to agree --- 57 representatives and 11 senators voted, unsuccessfully,
against the aid package. Second is risk. No one knows how the war in
Ukraine will end. If the US helps Ukraine defend itself too
successfully, the thinking goes, then perhaps a humiliated Russia will
escalate wildly rather than accept defeat. Finally, there is politics.
With Biden having gone all-in on Ukraine, there's little space for the
restraint contingent on the left. But Hawley and other Republicans
seeking to inherit Donald Trump's political base clearly believe that
there is a constituency for claims that supporting a vulnerable
democracy equates to putting "America last." It is uncharitable to label
such arguments "pro-Putin." Forty billion dollars is real money, given
that the Pentagon is struggling to find a 10th of that for urgent
near-term improvements to America's military posture in the Pacific.
There is, undoubtedly, danger in a scenario where Putin worries that he
is losing the war --- and in consequence loses his head. [But the
perpetual problem with restraint is the corresponding unwillingness to
consider what happens after America pulls back. Suppose Washington does
slash support to Ukraine and leave European security to the Europeans.
What does that bring? Judging by the past century --- or even the past
six months --- the answer is **not a stable Europe** and a more solvent
America. Rather,]{.underline} the result is likely to be a partially
[**successful Russian war of conquest** that creates **pervasive
insecurity** in Europe; a continent that, lacking **American
leadership**, is less united and confident in opposing Putin; and
greater **global instability** that ultimately makes it harder to
contain **China**, as well.]{.underline}

### 2AC\-\--UQ\-\--No Heg Decline

#### U.S. hegemony resists collapse

**Kovac 2/19** (Igor Kovac, PhD in political science from the University
of Cincinnati and Foreign Policy Advisor for the Slovenian Prime
Minister, 2/12/22, "Persistent Imbalance of Power -- A Pervasive
Hegemony Theory", pg ii-iii, accessed 6/18/22)//sfs

Most International Relations [literature suggests that when power
becomes imbalanced, such a situation will be corrected -- hegemony
cannot persist over time.]{.underline} However, [history offers us
several examples of hegemonies lasting over a century, e.g., Ancient
Rome, Ming China.]{.underline} So far [scholars have
offered]{.underline} four [explanations for such enduring
hegemony]{.underline} (Coercive Hegemony, Cooperative Hegemony, Cultural
Hegemony, and Opportunist Hegemony), [with a common mechanism:
ineffective balancing.]{.underline} Namely, [the hegemon has the
capacity to put balancing at bay using different strategies flowing from
the nature and fundamental principles of its hegemony.]{.underline}
Hence, the hegemon uses coercion, institutional leverage, ideological
indoctrination, or buyout, in order to assure its hegemony can endure.
[Yet, through time and through crisis the capacities of the hegemon to
make the balancing ineffective diminishes. As such, these theories all
share a similar assumption]{.underline} -- imbalance is transitory and
thus [hegemony will breakdown. But what if that common assumption is
incorrect. What if under certain conditions, imbalance is not resisted,
but rather serves interests of non-hegemonic states as well as the
hegemon? Twentieth and twenty-first century US hegemony suggests such
conditions may exist. This American imbalance displays a different
nature and fundamental mechanism behind its functioning. Although US
relative power is declining, its global monetary network centrality is
not. Moreover, even in times of severe crisis, such as the breakdown of
the Bretton Woods system, or the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, we
have not witnessed US monetary centrality decline. In fact, quite the
opposite is true.]{.underline} The dynamics associated with an imbalance
of power in favor of the United States runs against the expectations of
existing theories. Therefore, we need a different theory to make sense
of these particularities and make better policy recommendations. Thus, I
have developed a Pervasive Hegemony Theory, which is based on a 'buy-in'
behavior, that better explains US hegemony compared to existing
alternatives. The 'buy-in' behavior relates to non-hegemonic states as
well as the hegemon, in which all [countries continue to use hegemon's
monetary unit in their monetary relations, even in times of severe
economic crisis. This reinforces the hegemony. Even though non-hegemonic
states may not prefer the imbalance of power, they prefer conducting
their economic relations within the hegemon's monetary unit and thus
perpetuate the imbalance.]{.underline} Subsequently, [they can only
maximize their selfish interests and autonomy by buying-in to the
hegemony and reproducing the imbalance of power.]{.underline}
Conversely, the hegemon may not like the current rules and norms of the
international system, but it can change those and obtain the support of
the non-hegemonic states if it accepts to provide its monetary unit as
the central currency of the system. In pursuing this argument, I use
both quantitative (Network Analysis and Time Series) and qualitative
methods (Process Tracing). I use the former on available economic data
to establish the claim of US economic centrality, and that it is
something different than what we have seen in the past. Second, I
process trace the mechanisms of hegemonic and non-hegemonic state
behavior in two international monetary systems (Bretton Woods and
post-Bretton Woods) in order to isolate and identify the buy-in
mechanism and provide an explanation of enduring imbalance -- ownership
over the central monetary unit in global economy. The dissertation,
thus, assesses existing theories and indicates their inadequacies in
explaining an important international phenomenon and provides a more
robust explanation of enduring hegemony with the economic centrality,
namely the ownership of the central monetary unit.

CHAPTER 6 The Unipolar Era "If Sparta and Rome perished," the
philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau asked, "what State can hope to endure
forever?"1 The resounding answer given by history is "no state." In
time, perhaps in another century or so, the American empire will crumble
and new powers will rise. But we are not there yet, nor will we be for
many decades. **[We are living in the unipolar era, and it will probably
outlive us.]{.underline}** So what? [The United States might be the most
powerful country in his- tory, but it has a limited presence in many
corners of the globe]{.underline}, and weaker nations routinely trample
on U.S. interests.2 The United States failed to pre- vent the 9/11
terrorist attacks, the rise of the Islamic State, the Russian inva- sion
of Crimea, Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,
North Korean nuclear proliferation, and Chinese island-building in the
South China Sea. Unipolarity, bipolarity, multipolarity: What difference
does it make? In this final chapter, I explain why [this view is
wrong]{.underline} by highlighting several ways that unipolarity
transforms world politics. The good news is that **[unipolarity
dramatically reduces the likelihood of great power war.]{.underline}**
The bad news is that it may increase the likelihood of asymmetric
conflict and undermine American national unity and the liberal world
order. **[No Hegemonic Rivalry]{.underline}** The story of world
politics is often told as a game of thrones in which a rotating cast of
great powers battles for top-dog status. According to researchers led by
Graham Allison at Harvard, [there have been sixteen cases in the past
five hundred years when a rising power challenged a rul- ing
power.]{.underline}3 Twelve of these cases ended in carnage. One can
quibble with Allison's case selection, but the basic pattern is clear:
hegemonic rivalry has sparked a catastrophic war every forty years on
average for the past half millennium. [The emergence of unipolarity in
1991 has put this cycle of hegemonic competition on hold.]{.underline}
Obviously wars and security competition still occur in today's unipolar
world---in fact, as I explain later, unipolarity has made certain types
of asymmetric conflict more likely---but [none of these con- flicts have
the global scope or generational length of a hegemonic
rivalry.]{.underline} To appreciate this point, just consider the Cold
War---one of the four "peaceful" cases of hegemonic rivalry identified
by Allison's study. Although the two superpowers never went to war, they
divided the world into rival camps, waged proxy wars that killed
millions of people, and pushed each other to the brink of nuclear
Armageddon. For forty-five years, World War III and human extinction
were nontrivial possibilities. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union,
by contrast, **[the United States has not faced a hegemonic rival, and
the world, though far from perfect, has been more peaceful and
prosperous than ever before.]{.underline}** Just look at the numbers.
From 1400 to 1991, the rate of war deaths world- wide hovered between 5
and 10 deaths per 100,000 people and spiked to 200 deaths per 100,000
during major wars.4 After 1991, however, [war death rates
dropped]{.underline} to 0.5 deaths per 100,000 people and have stayed
there ever since. Interstate wars have disappeared almost entirely, and
the number of civil wars has declined by more than 30 percent.5
Meanwhile, [the global economy has quadrupled in size]{.underline},
creating more wealth between 1991 and 2018 than in all prior human
history combined.6 What explains this unprecedented outbreak of peace
and prosperity? Some scholars attribute it to advances in communications
technology, from the printing press to the telegraph to the Internet,
which supposedly spread empathy around the globe and caused entire
nations to place a higher value on human life.7 Such explanations are
appealing, because they play on our natural desire to believe in human
progress, but are they convincing? Did humans sud- denly become 10 to 20
times less violent and cruel in 1991? Are we orders of magnitude more
noble and kind than our grandparents? Has social media made us more
empathetic? Of course not, which is why the dra- matic decline in
warfare after 1991 is better explained by geopolitics than sociology.8
[The collapse of the Soviet Union not only ended the Cold War and
related proxy fighting, it also opened up large swathes of the world to
democracy, international commerce, and peacekeeping forces---all of
which surged after 1991 and further dampened conflict.]{.underline}9
Faced with overwhelming U.S. economic and military might, [most
countries have decided to work within the American-led liberal order
rather than fight to overturn it.]{.underline}10 As of 2018, nearly
seventy countries have joined the U.S. alliance network---a Kantian
community in which war is unthinkable---and even the two main challeng-
ers to this community, China and Russia, begrudgingly participate in the
institutions of the liberal order (e.g., the UN, the WTO, the IMF, World
Bank, and the G-20), engage in commerce with the United States and its
allies, and contribute to international peacekeeping missions.11 History
may not have ended in 1991, but it clearly changed in profound
ways---and mostly for the better.

#### Renewed US leadership counters Russia and reinvigorates US hegemony 

**Brands and Beckley, 22** (made the, 3-14-2022, accessed on 6-18-2022,

[The United States and its allies have failed to prevent Russia from
brutalizing Ukraine, but they can still win the larger struggle to save
the international order. Russia's savage invasion has exposed the gap
between Western countries' soaring liberal aspirations and the paltry
resources they have devoted to defend them.]{.underline} The United
States has declared great-power competition on Moscow and Beijing but
has so far failed to summon the money, the creativity, or the urgency
necessary to prevail in those rivalries. [Yet Russian President Vladimir
Putin has now inadvertently done the United States and its allies a
tremendous favor. In shocking them out of their complacency, he has
given them a historic opportunity to regroup and reload for an era of
intense competition---not just with Russia but also with China---and,
ultimately, to rebuild an international order that just recently looked
to be headed for collapse.]{.underline}

[This isn't fantasy: it has happened before. In the late 1940s, the West
was entering a previous period of great-power competition but had not
made the investments or initiatives needed to win it. U.S. defense
spending was pathetically inadequate, NATO existed only on paper, and
neither Japan nor West Germany had been reintegrated into the free
world. The Communist bloc seemed to have the momentum. Then, in June
1950, an instance of unprovoked authoritarian aggression---the Korean
War---revolutionized Western politics and laid the foundation for a
successful containment strategy. The policies that won the Cold War and
thereby made the modern liberal international order were products of an
unexpected hot war. The catastrophe in Ukraine could play a similar role
today.]{.underline}

Utilizing ideal points, we proposed cohesion, deviation, and adhesion
measures to empirically explore security alliance cohesion, Member State
deviations, and third state adhesions. Our findings suggest that
[security alliances such as NATO and the Warsaw Pact had higher cohesion
than other UN members, that external threat increased security alliance
cohesion, and that the United States turned out to be the most
significant deviating member in NATO since 1980, while third countries
such as Australia, South Korea, and Japan were more aligned with the
NATO alliance whereas Israel was more aligned with the United
States]{.underline}. By using our measures, one can study any alignment
pattern among any state groups in the UN, even without a priori
identifications of state groupings. Measures developed and tested in
this study can provide researchers with strong diagnostic tools. The
study contributes to the overall UNGA voting literature by providing
statistical inferences about the validity of the data.

We believe that the approach and new measures presented here could be
useful to investigate cohesion levels in other intergovernmental
organizations such as the EU and the Organization of Islamic
Cooperation, as well as economic communities like BRICS, while
pinpointing each state's political distance vis-à-vis each other or to a
defined group of states. Furthermore, using this approach and these new
measures could help researchers to concentrate on specific questions
(e.g., whether the foundation of BRICS really brought Member States
together on the issues of high politics, or whether Brexit could have
been predicted). In other words, while the approach offered here was
utilized more for descriptive purposes, it presents a superior
alternative to measure variance across time, increasing our predictive
power for actual or potential dramatic policy shifts at Member State and
at (any) group level by using the UNGA voting data.

[As the Trump administration threatened to abandon NATO, and as Russia
revives and China rises, "How long can NATO last in a post-US hegemonic,
multipolar world?" became one of the most important questions in
contemporary world politics. Contrary to Trump's withdrawal rhetoric, we
found that the height of the US ally deviation from NATO was during
2001--2008, coinciding with the presidential term of George W. Bush. In
fact, our findings suggest that Trump's NATO deviation scores came
behind those of two Democrat presidents, Obama and Clinton, when they
were put into an ordinal scale for heuristic purposes.]{.underline}

[Throughout this article, we deliberately tried to avoid any discussion
that might not be empirically verified]{.underline}, keeping the scope
of the article rather descriptive. Still, we believe studying the past
of the security alliances would give us considerable explanatory and
even predictive power. [We observed that threat perception, both for
external and internal]{.underline} (i.e., intra-alliance) [threats,
played a significant role in political alignments for security
alliances. The 9/11 attacks and activation of Article 5 of the
Washington Treaty led to a turning point for the NATO allies, as free
riding was replaced by joining costly global wars that were arguably
triggered by US hegemony in the world. In the past, the United States
provided deterrence against the Soviet Union as a public good for NATO
members. Over the past two decades, however, an increasing number of
NATO members have come to believe that they are being dragged into
"American wars." In this case, the problem would not be one of US
abdication or abandonment but balancing the hegemon.]{.underline}59 NATO
has survived US ally deviation for four decades. The height of US
deviation was actually in the past, not in the present. While alliance
cohesion was an important topic, especially after the end of the Cold
War, discussions about NATO have happened largely at a theoretical
level, revolving around realist, liberal and constructivist propositions
about whether NATO would collapse or survive.60 [The present research,
in contrast, was conducted at an empirical level.]{.underline} By
applying this approach to NATO, we were able to measure the flexibility
of the arrangement and obtain evidence to show what was really happening
with the United States and NATO, despite what might have been expected
from the rhetoric of Trump. [While our findings support some earlier
proposals, such as the external threat hypothesis, they also contradict
some others, including the literature on the decline of US hegemony and
its policy implications.]{.underline} We therefore hope that the new
approach developed here to measure foreign policy preferences by using a
spatial model and UNGA voting data might reignite interest for more
empirically driven future research on NATO and other alliances, as well
as cohesion of states in other organizations, while also strengthening
the overall validity and therefore confidence in using UNGA voting data
with spatial models.61

#### The US is trying to expand hegemony now to compete with China

<https://quincyinst.org/report/ending-primacy-to-end-u-s-wars/#china-and-primacy>,
accessed 6/26/22)//jd

It is painfully obvious today that [U.S. officials remain committed to
primacy even though the strategy has led the United States into several
expensive wars of questionable value to the nation's fundamental
security interests --- Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria --- all of which
have diverted resources that could have been better spent on
improvements at home.]{.underline} Moreover, polling suggests that
younger generations are becoming increasingly skeptical of primacy and
more interested in participating in international organizations, which
indicates that now is an apt time to reconsider a grand strategy that
decision-makers embraced more than 75 years ago.22 Biden's August 31,
2021, speech announcing the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan makes
Washington's continued devotion to primacy very clear. The president
declared that the United States remains committed to combating threats
from "across the world," from Somalia to Syria, from Iraq to Africa and
Asia, and will use its "over-the-horizon capabilities" to launch attacks
when and where it thinks it should.23 [The entire globe, it appears,
remains under the U.S. ambit. Thus the United States retains 750
military bases and other facilities abroad, and thus the nation devotes
almost \$800 billion per annum to its military budget.24 In his
Afghanistan speech, Biden cast China as the central threat to U.S.
interests.]{.underline}25 Indeed, in his first speech to Congress as
president, on April 28, 2021, [Biden affirmed that the United States is
"in competition with China]{.underline} and other countries to win the
21st Century."26 While competition does not necessarily imply military
conflict, Biden's speech was followed by an increased military budget as
opposed to other sorts of investments --- in science, technology, and
education, for instance. In early April 2022, Biden approved an
additional \$29 billion increase in defense spending.27 T[his suggests
that the Biden administration remains fundamentally committed to primacy
--- that is, armed global domination.]{.underline} The idea seems to be
that either the United States militarily dominates China or China
militarily dominates the United States. Among the policy planners, no
third scenario can be imagined. It is painfully obvious today that U.S.
officials remain committed to primacy even though the strategy has led
the United States into several expensive wars of questionable value to
the nation's fundamental security interests. According to primacy's
advocates, the globe cannot peacefully encompass a plurality of powers
and interests: It can accommodate only one power that rules through
domination, or what is euphemistically termed "leadership" when the U.S.
is the hegemon. [This is why "primacists" are so worried about China:
They view international relations as a zero-sum game.]{.underline} As
Ivo Daalder and James Lindsay argue in The Empty Throne, "a world with
no leader would leave the United States poorer and less secure than if
it continued to lead globally."28 Indeed, Daalder and Lindsay are quite
worried about China, affirming in no uncertain terms that "\[a\]
Chinese-dominated world would not be friendly to the United States."29
When making arguments such as this, [primacists fail fully to consider
that a more multilateral world might be defined by **cooperation instead
of security competition.**]{.underline} Rush Doshi, who is currently a
member of Biden's National Security Council, likewise frames
international relations in zero-sum terms. In The Long Game, Doshi
worries that China has developed "a grand strategy to displace American
order" and become "the world's leading state."30 The only thing the
United States can do, Doshi concludes, is "adopt an asymmetric approach
that blunts Chinese advances at lower cost than China expends in
generating them."31 [Cooperation is barely thinkable. Over the past
several years, U.S.--China relations have soured markedly. The Trump
administration, which was replete with China "hawks," instituted several
tariffs on Chinese imports that provoked retaliatory measures and
resulted in a minor trade war between the two countries.]{.underline}
Trump also undertook several other actions that indicated his
administration's hostility toward China. He launched a vigorous campaign
to limit the reach of Huawei, the highly competitive telecommunications
giant, eventually pressuring Canadian authorities to arrest Meng
Wanzhou, the company's chief financial officer, on bank fraud charges
(charges since dropped). In 2019, Trump's Treasury Department officially
labeled China a currency manipulator; that same year, the president
signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which authorized
sanctions against those who commit human rights abuses in Hong Kong.
Trump's insistence that Covid--19 was a "Chinese virus" was merely the
crudest reflection of his administration's view that China was the main
threat to U.S. supremacy.32 [The Biden administration has similarly
pursued a number of policies intended to counter China's
rise.]{.underline} The Federal Communications Commission, the Commerce
Department, and the Treasury have blacklisted numerous Chinese companies
as the administration has sanctioned several individuals in connection
with Beijing's Hong Kong policy and its treatment of the Uighur
population in Xinjiang Province. [The administration has also prevailed
upon NATO to declare China a security risk.]{.underline} Moreover, Biden
has continued Trump's ban on U.S. investment in Chinese
defense-technology companies and, earlier this year, forbade U.S.
officials from attending the Winter Olympics in Beijing.33 Finally, last
June the Senate passed the U.S. Innovation and Strategic Competition
Act, which is specifically intended to combat China (particularly in the
technological sphere); the House approved a related America COMPETES Act
in January 2022.34 What, exactly, is Biden willing to risk in his
attempt to ensure the U.S. remains the prime power wherever and forever?
Might he, or a future president, risk war?

if **[non-hegemonic balancing were to take place, one should expect it

shrinking role in the global economy. Yet, the story we have experienced
since 2008 is very different. Figure 5 shows the contemporary dominant
position of the US dollar in comparison to other currencies according to

dynamically since 2008 brings us to the same conclusion. If anything,
[the global position, and dominance of the US dollar has actually
increased after 2008.]{.underline} It has not stayed the same, nor has
it declined. Figure 6 portrays the issuance of international credits and
what is astonishing is that with the rise of the amount of credits
issued, also the amount of them issued in US dollar increases, while
those in Euro or Japanese Yen decrease. Therefore, [**the US dollar

2\. PERVASIVE HEGEMONY THEORY "In /a/ sense, **[money and languages have
similar characteristics, and the US dollar is the lingua franca for
today's international monetary system.]{.underline}**"58 [The crux of
the Pervasive Hegemony Theory is the 'buy-in' dynamic, by which **the
hegemon and non-hegemonic states both reinforce the
hegemony.**]{.underline} Since the latter is defined as a set of rules,
norms, and principles of how the hegemon centers the world economy
around it. This means that the hegemon and non-hegemonic states either
display their commitment to existing economic rules or consensually
embrace new ones. Hence, assuming that monetary relations are the most
important aspect of economics, and that politics and economics are not
independent, **[the rules composing a monetary system is at the core of
hegemony, and its change is my dependent variable.]{.underline}** Being
interested in enduring hegemony, I want to observe how a hegemony
endures even when it must change this quintessential dimension---the
monetary system. I operationalize the International Monetary System
(IMS) and its rules through the monetary trilemma59 and the manner of
its functioning in terms of adjustment, liquidity, and confidence.60
Still, theoretically the more important question is **[why do
non-hegemonic states and the hegemon alike 'buy-in'?]{.underline}** I
argue that **[it is due to the hegemonic ownership of the central
monetary unit.]{.underline}** Thus, this is my independent variable,
which is composed of two elements: first, the central
position---referring to the most important node in a network;61 second,
the ownership---meaning a control over the production of the monetary
unit. Therefore, I operationalize this variable by measuring the network
centrality of the hegemon's monetary unit over time (e.g., reserves,
transactions). As such, if the global centrality of the hegemon's
currency is stationary (mean and variance do not change through time)62
even in times of economic crises, and during a subsequent change in the
IMS, we can talk about the presence of a 'buy-in' and this hegemony may
be classified as a pervasive hegemony. Hence, [the ownership of a
central monetary unit creates a system where the non-hegemonic states
can extract the benefits of using the hegemon's currency only if they
'buy- in' first]{.underline}, i.e., reproduce the IMS. The latter
sequence is necessary as the hegemon may not be willing to procure its
currency, particularly in times of crisis. Moreover, the ownership of
the central monetary unit plugs into the risk-aversion of non-hegemonic
states, so they do not seek an alternative monetary unit, as existing
monetary centrality sufficiently generates the framework for their
fulfillment of autonomy and maximizing national interests. Instead of
seeking alternatives, [they reinforce the new rules of
hegemony]{.underline}, i.e., of the monetary system. Subsequently, the
hegemon does not roll back its currency, and the non-hegemonic states
may continue to reap benefits from using the hegemon's currency. The
hegemon reaches the same conclusion through an opposite perspective.
Namely, the hegemon realizes that it is through the provision of a
central monetary currency that it can generate a new consensus on the
rules, norms, and principles of the IMS that would reflect its own
selfish interest better. Therefore, the hegemon is interested in
securing such a new monetary system first, before making its currency
available. Hence, [**both sides reinforce the hegemony, while at the
same time both sides follow their selfish and rational national
interests.** US pervasive hegemony, is]{.underline} therefore, [the
story of US dollar centrality.]{.underline}63 Helleiner sums it up
perfectly: "Washington has played little direct role in promoting
dollarization abroad. Nevertheless, the United States has profited from
this development."64 For example, according to one estimate, the annual
return on US investments overseas is 1.2% higher than its payments on
overseas debt.65 However, the literature66 is divided along the fault
line of US dollar persistence in its global dominance,67 and an
evolution away from US dollar-based system towards multi- currency
world.68 Furthermore, it is also skeptical about US benefits from its
hegemony.69 Helleiner and Kirshner "argue that there are three distinct
sets of /\.../ assumptions that dominate the literature on the future of
the dollar: those embodied in market-based, instrumental, and
geopolitical approaches to the subject."70 In all three of these
approaches one finds scholars that support the decline of US hegemony
and predict a bleak future for the US dollar, as well as those who
predict the sustainable dominance of the US dollar and hence US
hegemony.

**The US has created a stable international order, that can be easily
undone by diminishing hegemony.**

However, it is the two great powers, [**China and Russia**, that pose
the greatest **challenge to** the relatively **peace**ful and prosperous
international order created and sustained by the United States. If they
were to accomplish their aims]{.underline} of establishing hegemony in
their desired spheres of influence, [the world would return to the
condition it was in at the end of the 19th century, with competing great
powers clashing over inevitably intersecting and overlapping spheres of
interest.]{.underline} These were the unsettled, disordered conditions
that produced the fertile ground for the two destructive world wars of
the first half of the 20th century. The collapse of the
British-dominated world order on the oceans, the disruption of the
uneasy balance of power on the European continent due to the rise of a
powerful unified Germany, combined with the rise of Japanese power in
East Asia all contributed to a highly competitive international
environment in which dissatisfied great powers took the opportunity to
pursue their ambitions in the absence of any power or group of powers to
unite in checking them. The result was an [**unprecedented global
calamity.** It has been the great accomplishment of the U.S.-led world
order in the 70 years since the end of the Second World War that this
kind of competition has been **held in check** and **great power
conflicts have been avoided.** The **role of the U**nited **S**tates,
however, has been **critical**. Until recently, the dissatisfied great
and medium-size powers have faced considerable and indeed almost
**insuperable obstacles** to achieving their objectives. The chief
obstacle has been the power and coherence of the order itself and of its
principal promoter and defender. The American-led system of political
and military alliances, especially in the two critical regions of Europe
and East Asia, has presented China and Russia with]{.underline} what
Dean Acheson once referred to as ["**situations of strength**" in their
regions that have required them **to pursue their ambitions cautiously**
and in most respects to **defer serious efforts** to disrupt the
international system. The system has served as a **check on their
ambitions**]{.underline} in both positive and negative ways. They have
been participants in and for the most part beneficiaries of the open
international economic system the United States created and helped
sustain and, so long as that system was functioning, have had more to
gain by playing in it than by challenging and overturning it. The same
cannot be said of the political and strategic aspects of the order, both
of which have worked to their detriment. [The growth and vibrancy of
democratic government in the two decades following the collapse of
Soviet communism have posed a continual threat to the ability of rulers
in Beijing and Moscow to maintain control, and since the end of the Cold
War they have regarded every advance of democratic institutions,
including especially the geographical advance close to their borders, as
an **existential threat**---and **with reason**.]{.underline} The
**continual threat** to the basis of their rule posed by the
U.S.-supported order has made them hostile both to the order and to the
United States. However, it has also been a source of weakness and
vulnerability. [Chinese rulers in particular have had to worry about
what an unsuccessful confrontation with the United States might do to
their sources of legitimacy at home. And although Vladimir Putin has to
some extent used a calculated foreign adventurism to maintain his hold
on domestic power, he has taken a more **cautious approach** when met
with determined U.S. and European opposition, as in the case of Ukraine,
and pushed forward, as in Syria, **only when invited** to do so **by
U.S. and Western passivity**. Autocratic rulers in a liberal democratic
world **have had to be careful.** The **greatest check** on Chinese and
Russian ambitions, however, has come from the combined **military power
of the U**nited **S**tates and its allies in Europe and Asia. China,
although increasingly powerful itself, has had to contemplate facing the
combined military strength of the world's superpower and some very
formidable regional powers linked by alliance or common strategic
interest, including Japan, India, and South Korea, as well as smaller
but still potent nations like Vietnam and Australia. Russia has had to
face the United States and its NATO allies. When united, these military
powers present a **daunting challenge** to a revisionist power that can
call on no allies of its own for assistance.]{.underline} Even were the
Chinese to score an early victory in a conflict, they would have to
contend over time with the combined industrial productive capacities of
some of the world's richest and most technologically advanced nations. A
weaker Russia would face an even greater challenge. Faced with these
obstacles, the two great powers, as well as the lesser dissatisfied
powers, have had to hope for or if possible engineer a weakening of the
U.S.-supported world order from within. This could come about either by
separating the United States from its allies, raising doubts about the
U.S. commitment to defend its allies militarily in the event of a
conflict, or by various means wooing American allies out from within the
liberal world order's strategic structure. For most of the past decade,
the reaction of American allies to greater aggressiveness on the part of
China and Russia in their respective regions, and to Iran in the Middle
East, has been to seek more reassurance from the United States. Russian
actions in Georgia, Ukraine, and Syria; Chinese actions in the East and
South China seas; Iranian actions in Syria, Iraq, and along the littoral
of the Persian Gulf---all have led to calls by American allies and
partners for a greater commitment. [In this respect, the system has
worked as it was supposed to.]{.underline} What the political scientist
William Wohlforth once described as the [**inherent stability** of the
unipolar order reflected this dynamic---as dissatisfied regional powers
sought to challenge the status quo, their alarmed neighbors turned to
the **distant American superpower** to **contain their
ambitions**.]{.underline} The system has depended, however, on will,
capacity, and coherence at the heart of the liberal world order. The
United States had to be willing and able to play its part as the
principal guarantor of the order, especially in the military and
strategic realm. The order's ideological and economic core---the
democracies of Europe and East Asia and the Pacific---had to remain
relatively healthy and relatively confident. In such circumstances, [the
combined political, economic, and military power of the liberal world
would be **too great to be seriously challenged** by the great powers,
much less by the smaller dissatisfied powers.]{.underline}

**The only way to preserve liberalism is through American hegemony.**

[The messy truth is that in the real world, the **only hope** for
preserving liberalism at home and abroad is the maintenance of a world
order conducive to liberalism, and the **only power capable** of
upholding such an order is the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}. This
is not an expression of hubris but a [reality rooted in international
circumstances.]{.underline} And it is certainly a mixed blessing. In
trying to preserve this order, the United States has wielded and will
wield power, sometimes unwisely and ineffectively, with unpredictable
costs and morally ambiguous consequences. That is what wielding power
means. [Americans have naturally sought to escape this burden. They have
sought to divest themselves of responsibility, hiding sometimes behind
dreamy internationalism, sometimes behind a determined resignation to
accept the world \"as it is,\" and always with the view that absent a
clear and present danger, they can hang back in their imaginary
fortress. The time has come to tell Americans that there is **no escape
from global responsibility**, that they have to think beyond the
protection of the homeland. They need to understand that the purpose of
NATO and other alliances is to defend not against direct threats to U.S.
interests but against a **breakdown of the order** that best serves
those interests. They need to be told honestly that the task of
maintaining a world order is unending and fraught with costs but
**preferable to the alternative.**]{.underline} A failure to be square
with the American people has led the country to its current predicament,
with a confused and angry public convinced that its leaders are
betraying American interests for their own nefarious, \"globalist\"
purposes. The antidote to this is not scaring the hell out of them about
China and other threats but trying to explain, again, why the world
order they created still matters. This is a job for Joe Biden and his
new administration.

With the election of Donald Trump, a majority of Americans have signaled
their unwillingness to continue upholding the world order. Trump was not
the only candidate in 2016 to run on a platform suggesting a much
narrower definition of American interests and a lessening of the burdens
of American global leadership. ["America First" is not just an empty
phrase but a fairly coherent philosophy]{.underline} with a long lineage
and many adherents in the American academy. It calls for [viewing
American interests through a narrow lens. It suggests no longer
supporting an international alliance structure, no longer seeking to
deny great powers their spheres of influence and regional hegemony, no
longer attempting to **uphold liberal norms** in the international
system, and no longer sacrificing short-term interests]{.underline}---in
trade for instance---[in the longer-term interest of preserving an
**open economic order**. Coming as it does at a time of growing great
power competition, this new approach in American foreign policy is
likely to hasten a return to the **instability and clashes** of previous
eras.]{.underline} These external challenges to the liberal world order
and the continuing weakness and fracturing of the liberal world from
within are likely to feed on each other. [The weakness of the liberal
core and the abdication by the United States of its global
responsibilities will encourage more **aggressive revisionism** by the
dissatisfied powers, which may in turn exacerbate the sense of weakness
and helplessness and the loss of confidence of the liberal world, which
will in turn increase the sense on the part of the great power
autocracies that this is their opportunity to reorder the world to
conform to their interests.]{.underline} History suggests that this is a
downward spiral from which it will be difficult to recover absent a
major conflict. It was in the 1920s, not the 1930s, that the most
important and ultimately fatal decisions were made by the liberal
powers. Above all, it was the [American decision to remove itself from a
position of **global responsibility**, to **reject strategic
involvement** to preserve the peace in Europe, and neglect its naval
strength in the Pacific to check the rise of Japan. The "return to
normalcy" of the 1920 U.S. election seemed safe and innocent at the
time, but the essentially **selfish policies p**ursued by the world's
strongest power in the following decade helped set the stage for the
**calamities** of the 1930s.]{.underline} By the time the crises began
to erupt in that decade, it was already too late to avoid paying the
high price of **global conflict.** One thing for the new administration
to keep in mind: [History tells us that revisionist great powers are not
easy to satisfy short of **complete capitulation**. Their sphere of
influence is never quite large enough to satisfy their pride or their
expanding need for security.]{.underline} The "satiated" power that
Bismarck spoke of is rare---even his Germany, in the end, could not be
satiated. And of course, rising great powers always express some
historical grievance. Every people, except perhaps for the fortunate
Americans, have reason for resentment at ancient injustices, nurse
grudges against old adversaries, seek to return to a glorious past that
was stolen from them by military or political defeat. The world's supply
of grievances is inexhaustible.

### 2AC\-\--UQ\-\--Decline = Fake News

#### US Hegemonic decline is a product of fake news and sensationalist reporting -- sustainability is different from perfection

**Jackson, 22** (Lauren Jackson, 1-7-2022, accessed on 6-18-2022, The
New York Times, \"The Idea of American Decay\",
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/07/podcasts/america-decline-capitol-riot.html)

[The idea that America is in decline isn't new. For decades, academics
have warned that partisan gridlock, politicized courts and unfettered
lobbying were like dangerous substances --- if taken in excess,
America's democratic systems were at risk of collapse. But what happens
when the idea itself gets mainlined? When words like "died," "decline"
and "dagger" sit near "America" on front pages across the country? When
a majority of the American public rewrites the story they tell
themselves about their country's standing in the world? That's what some
experts say is happening now --- that the Capitol riot and its aftermath
have normalized a sense among Americans that the country, its economic
system and its standing in the world are in decline. New data supports
this claim: 70 percent of Americans believe the U.S. is "in crisis and
at risk of failing," according to a recent poll]{.underline}. Fortifying
America's democracy is not just about ensuring the trustworthiness of
elections, but also about safeguarding Americans' belief in the
possibility of change. So what happens when that self-conception falters
[--- when Americans begin to believe their country isn't winning, but
instead is losing a long battle? A fractured collective narrative at
home "Jan. 6 and then the Republican reaction is a really important
turning point in the perception of American decline," said Francis
Fukuyama, a political scientist and author.]{.underline} Mr. Fukuyama
noted that while he had been writing about American political decay for
years, the concept had assumed more systemic import after the Capitol
riots --- and wider acceptance. [Just a few years ago, a majority of
Americans believed the U.S. was one of the greatest nations in the
world. In a Pew Research survey from 2017, 85 percent of respondents
said either that the U.S. "stands above all other countries in the
world" or that it is "one of the greatest countries, along with some
others." Additionally, 58 percent of those surveyed said the American
democracy was working "somewhat" or "very well." "Prior to the rise of
all this populism," Mr. Fukuyama said, "there was a basic progressive
narrative to American history. And that was based on a Declaration of
Independence and a Constitution that were flexible enough to be modified
over time to be made more inclusive." "This American narrative that has
held us together, it doesn't hold anymore," he said, adding that the
riot, "more than anything that happened during the Trump presidency, I
think does underline that." Now, nearly two-thirds of respondents in the
NPR/Ipsos poll agreed that U.S. democracy is "more at risk" now than it
was a year ago.]{.underline} Among Republicans, that number climbs to
four in five. This narrative persists on both sides of the political
spectrum --- with each side pointing the finger at the other as a threat
to the nation's well-being. It's also a narrative that has direct
effects on American democracy --- polarizing partisanship on national
and local levels, affecting critical legislative functions like passing
budgets and limiting social consensus-building in response to crises
like Covid. The Themes of the Jan. 6 House Committee Hearings In light
of these varied crises, "what is most striking is not what has changed
but what has not," Peter Baker, The Times's chief White House
correspondent, wrote on the anniversary of the Capitol Riots. "America
has not come together to defend its democracy; it has only split further
apart." It is this growing chasm that some political theorists say will
be most difficult to reconcile in the interest of shoring up America's
democratic institutions. "We have two Americas," James Morone, a
professor of political science at Brown University, said, with Americans
in urban centers experiencing the benefits of globalization while many
in rural areas feel left behind as the American middle class shrinks.
These two Americas also often inhabit opposing factual realities,
allowing misinformation to persist and even fuel violence. "And here's
the thing: Each is represented by a different party. That's one reason
the two-party system is breaking down." Rippling effects abroad This
national self-doubt also has implications for the perception of American
strength and supremacy globally, a challenge for President Biden's
foreign policy as his administration struggles to win back the global
repute thrown into question by four years of "America First." In his
address at the Capitol on Jan. 6, Mr. Biden said, "Both at home and
abroad, we're engaged anew in a struggle between democracy and
autocracy." Donald J. Trump and his allies continue to push a false
retelling of the 2020 election, in which Democrats stole the vote and
the Jan. 6 riot to disrupt President Biden's certification was largely
peaceful or was staged by Mr. Trump's opponents. This approach is part
of a broader transformation of authoritarian tactics globally, as Max
Fisher, the Interpreter columnist at The Times, points out. "Dictators
have shifted emphasis from blunt-force repression (although this still
happens, too) to subtler methods like manipulating information or sowing
division, aimed at preventing dissent over suppressing it," he wrote.
Now, history is being rewritten in Russia, Hungary and China, where
governments are repressing and sanitizing elements of national history
in favor of contemporary politics --- as is also happening in the United
States. This tactical similarity with foreign autocrats, some experts
argue, throws American ideals into question internationally. "If crucial
facts can be denied by a major American party and millions of American
citizens, aren't all American claims to truth and rationality suspect?"
said Robert Daly, director of the Kissinger Institute on China[. "For as
long as I can remember, U.S. democracy, even with its flaws, was held up
as the gold standard of democracy worldwide," said Cynthia Arnson,
director of the Latin America program at the Wilson Center. Now,
according to a Pew Research survey, a median of just 17 percent of
respondents said democracy in the U.S. is a good example for others to
follow. America still benefits from some positive reputational
assessments around the world, with a majority of respondents to the Pew
survey expressing favorable opinions on America's technology, its
military and its entertainment output.]{.underline} But some experts
argue those sources of soft power are also under threat in conjunction
with democratic backsliding. "One of the side effects of losing the
democracy is losing control over the markets," Rebecca Henderson, a
professor at Harvard Business School, said, adding, "I think it's an
incredibly dangerous moment. I think we absolutely could lose the
democracy."

For years, many believed that a world of global economic networks and
interdependence --- countries intimately connected via supply chains and
finances --- made war obsolete. [That is part of the reason Russia's
invasion of Ukraine was so shocking. But the international economy
itself has turned into a battlefield.]{.underline} [The conventional war
in Ukraine has unleashed a swift and staggering economic conflict, led
by the United States and its allies against Russia.]{.underline} And
that war is being waged with new weapons, forged in the post-Cold War
age of global networks. [As much as we talk about **multipolar
politics**,]{.underline} when it comes to global networks[, **there is
just one superpower: the United States**.]{.underline} [Many global
networks have centralized economic chokepoints, and the United States is
able to seize these, turning them into tools of coercion. **No other
country can match this ability**. America can now redeploy global
networks to entangle and suffocate oligarchs, banks and even entire
countries, as Russia has painfully discovered. It is now up to the
United States to determine how to steward this enormous
power.]{.underline} If it overreaches, it might provoke a military
response or create the incentive for its adversaries to create and
foster their own alternative networks. The Ukraine war may be a turning
point. Will we end up with a fragmented world economy where military and
economic conflict become two sides of the same coin? Or will we figure
out ways to contain economic conflicts and stop them from spiraling into
further military confrontations?

As history will show, realists will argue, and the liberals will nibble
on their thumbs, [unipolarity often exhibits symptoms of the wave
function collapse]{.underline}, a quantum mechanics term which
essentially means the return of an object to an initial level, after
elevating due to external build-up (factors indirectly affected by the
object). Metaphorically applying this definition to the context of
sovereign states, gives us the root cause of all the major events which
have molded our global politics into its present state. Be it the World
Wars, atomic bomb, democratization or the Cold War, [history is
abounding with examples of unipolarity being only a passing stage in a
vicious circle of this global game.]{.underline}

At its climax, the Cold War saw the disintegration of the U.S.S.R., and
the United States left as the only superpower in the world. The world
order was reset, and amidst extreme chaos and failing governments, the
United States emerged as a beacon of hope. Freshly independent states
wanted to rebuild themselves in America's image. Nations worldwide went
into a frenzied state of enhancing their economic and politico-social
conditions. [The underlying principle was simple. The United States was
perceived as an individual hegemon. And states, dubious of the hegemon's
intentions, vied to enhance their own influence and security. As
neoliberalism dictates, the singular rise of a nation state forces the
others to balance its influence, which in turn can only be achieved by
individually augmenting their own influence.]{.underline}

[Such is also the case of smaller nations, which experience extremely
high growth rates due to the catch-up effect, and in the process, get
aspirations for their own national interests.]{.underline} Smaller
powers need not spend as much as the big powers on defense, or global
initiatives, and can use that to budget for economic and societal
development (Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia, S. Africa, etc.). In case of
R&D, [the smaller states can merely acquire the latest technology, or in
the least, receive assistance from allied states to procure it, thus
saving the time and money initially spent on developing it]{.underline}
(Russia-India/U.S-S.Korea, etc.). With a number of such nations
functioning in close proximity to one another, a race to impose
dominance in a region initiates, often leading to political and/or
military clashes (see the Indo-Pak nuclear tests, 1998). [The solo
hegemon, apprehensive of such development as a threat to itself, would
then try to counter these rising states by forming alliances either with
them]{.underline} (China-Pak), [or against them]{.underline}
(China-India). In either case, unipolarity has transitioned into
multipolarity. This new alliance will now be a hegemon, and have a
catalytic effect on a third state, or a group of states, which would
again begin the process of balancing the alliance's power and influence,
thus starting a Domino Effect in the region specifically, and in the
world as a whole.

Also, [the initial big power]{.underline}, in the wake of these
developments, [may try to coerce the rising powers into agreeing to
international frameworks which can be puppeteered by it]{.underline}
(the League of Nations, United Nations). [This persuasive tendency may
make the smaller powers even more vary of the hegemon, and boycott the
frameworks altogether, weakening the hegemon's influence even
further]{.underline} (N. Korea, India and Pakistan against the NPT).

[Unipolarity is, thus, only a repetitive stage in world
politics.]{.underline} Undeniably, [it will always be followed by
multipolarity, which is more of a defensive mechanism to unipolarity, as
opposed to a different world order.]{.underline} The World Wars were a
result of many great nations vying for influence and power in a
multipolar world. So it can be said that unipolarity is an unfortunate
outcome of multipolarity. This balance between the two is the
fundamental clockwork of world politics.

#### No multipolarity - American "renaissance" and decline of revisionist powers ensures that the US will retain global influence

The end of 2021 couldn't come fast enough. A year that started with
January's insurrectionist storming of the Capitol is ending with
Omicron's December surge, threatening a tentative economic recovery. And
plenty of bad news happened in-between. [Social strife, rising
inflation, a disastrous U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan, and
political gridlock in Washington makes it seem like America is an empire
in decline.]{.underline} Except that the [data doesn't back up this
catchy political punchline]{.underline}. [Rather than another year
highlighting the **inevitable end of U.S.** economic and political
**influence** as authoritarian governments rise around the world, 2021
showed an **American renaissance** in the offing. The U.S. economy is
poised for a strong 2022. That's making the world's authoritarian
leaders nervous. Driven by the recovery, U.S. international influence is
growing again after years of retrenchment. From Moscow to Beijing to
Istanbul, excessive state control is causing economic pain for the
people in the grip of authoritarianism. Their **international political
isolation** is growing. It's **easy to take a negative view** on U.S.
prospects.]{.underline} At first glance, perceptions of U.S. democracy
around the world are strikingly low among other advanced democracies,
such stalwart proponents as the UK, Germany, and Japan. According to an
early 2021 Pew research poll, 57% agreed that the U.S. political system
"used to be a good example" for others, but only 17% felt that it still
is. [That seems ominous, but look closer. Another Pew survey of these
same countries, also in early 2021, found 61% had an overall positive
view of the U.S., compared to the 27% who viewed China favorably. This
preference extended to economic relations as well.]{.underline} When
asked which country was more important for "strong economic ties," 64%
preferred the U.S. versus 21% choosing China, despite many viewing China
as the dominant global economic power. [Part of these favorable views
may have to do with the **U.S. re-engaging with allies**. As Russia cuts
back on natural gas sales to Europe just as winter bites, the U.S. is
increasing exports of liquified natural gas to these
countries.]{.underline} Russian troops are on Ukraine's borders, and
Putin is attempting to wring security guarantees out of Washington. But
the White House is refusing to be split off from NATO in a joint
approach to Moscow. China has amped up military threats to Taiwan.
Record numbers of military fly-bys near Taiwan prompted Washington and
Tokyo to state their support for the island. Chinese flights dropped
dramatically shortly after. [China has also sustained its militarization
of the South China Sea, despite losing its case under the U.N.
Convention on the Law of the Sea. In response, the U**.S. has
strengthened military ties** with Australia and India in an actual pivot
to an Indo-Pacific strategy.]{.underline} [These are not the moves of a
country in decline,]{.underline} but rather one that puts alliances
first in lieu of unilateral action. [As the U.S. economy begins to
**thrive again**, it is helping consolidate global influence chipped
away by a more insular approach. The domestic economy has remained
remarkably robust, even with the trifecta of supply chain bottlenecks,
rising prices, and a Covid slowdown that for several months earlier this
year devastated the services industries (restaurants, movie theaters,
hotels).]{.underline} Consumer spending rose a solid 8.5% from the
beginning of November through late December over the same period a year
ago. Holiday-specific sales rose 10.7% over prepandemic 2019 spending
levels. This can be partly attributed to forced Covid-induced savings
and the Federal Reserve's seemingly insatiable desire to print money.
People have been feeling so flush with cash that they've been quitting
their jobs in droves. [Economic resilience is behind yet another
positive trend: Countries around the world are making longer-term bets
on U.S. growth with increased foreign direct investment. After several
years of declines, inbound FDI soared.]{.underline} For the third
quarter of 2021, \$74.5 billion flowed into the country, a 68% increase
over the same period a year ago. Second quarter figures were 144% higher
than the year ago period. And both were significantly higher even
compared with 2019 prepandemic levels. [How are the leading
authoritarian countries faring? According to the OECD, while the U.S.
economy expanded by 0.6% in the third quarter over the second, China
grew only 0.2%, and Russia declined by 0.8%.]{.underline} The challenges
of continued U.S. growth and sustained global influence are hardly
insignificant. Threats to a free and fair 2022 midterm election cannot
be taken lightly. Failure to pass legislation to stem climate change,
bridge the enormous wealth gap, and improve education would certainly
degrade U.S. competitiveness. But these would be entirely self-inflicted
wounds. [And they are largely within **Washington's power to overcome**.
For countries like China and Russia, their **problems are systemic** and
unlikely to improve because the efforts needed to reverse these trends
threaten the authoritarian systems that caused them in the first
place---namely, centralized economic control and a rogue's list of
political-military relationships with countries like North Korea, Syria,
and Iran.]{.underline} Every new year brings with it hopes for change.

### 2AC\-\--LIO Sustainable 

#### The liberal international order is sustainable -- innovation and competition makes it stronger

accessed 6/22/22)//jd

THE RESILIENT ORDER After World War II, liberal democracies joined
together to create an international order that reflected their shared
interests. And as is the case with liberal democracy itself, the order
that emerged to accompany it cannot be easily undone. For one thing, it
is deeply embedded. [Hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people
have geared their activities and expectations to the order's
institutions and incentives, from farmers to microchip makers. However
unappealing aspects of it may be, replacing the liberal order with
something significantly different would be extremely
difficult.]{.underline} Despite the high expectations they generate,
revolutionary moments often fail to make enduring changes. [It is
unrealistic today to think that a few years of nationalist demagoguery
will dramatically undo liberalism. Growing interdependence makes the
order especially difficult to overturn.]{.underline} Ever since its
inception in the eighteenth century, liberalism has been deeply
committed to the progressive improvement of the human condition through
scientific discovery and technological advancements. This Enlightenment
project began to bear practical fruits on a large scale in the
nineteenth century, transforming virtually every aspect of human life.
New techniques for production, communication, transportation, and
destruction poured forth. [The liberal system has been at the forefront
not just of stoking those fires of innovation but also of addressing the
negative consequences]{.underline}. Adam Smith's case for free trade,
for example, was strengthened when it became easier to establish supply
chains across global distances. And the age-old case for peace was
vastly strengthened when weapons evolved from being simple and limited
in their destruction to the city-busting missiles of the nuclear era.
Liberal democratic capitalist societies have thrived and expanded
because they have been particularly adept at stimulating and exploiting
innovation and at coping with their spillover effects and negative
externalities. In short, [liberal modernity excels at both harvesting
the fruits of modern advance and guarding against its dangers. This
dynamic of constant change and ever-increasing interdependence is only
accelerating. Human progress has caused grave harm to the planet and its
atmosphere, yet climate change will also require unprecedented levels of
international cooperation]{.underline}. With the rise of bioweapons and
cyberwarfare, the capabilities to wreak mass destruction are getting
cheaper and ever more accessible, making the international regulation of
these technologies a vital national security imperative for all
countries. [At the same time, global capitalism has drawn more people
and countries into cross-border webs of exchange, thus making virtually
everyone dependent on the competent management of international finance
and trade.]{.underline} In the age of global interdependence, even a
realist must be an internationalist. The international order is also
likely to persist because its survival does not depend on all of its
members being liberal democracies. The return of isolationism, the rise
of illiberal regimes such as China and Russia, and the general recession
of liberal democracy in many parts of the world appear to bode ill for
the liberal international order. But contrary to the conventional
wisdom, many of its institutions are not uniquely liberal in character.
Rather, they are Westphalian, in that they are designed merely to solve
problems of sovereign states, whether they be democratic or
authoritarian. And many of the key participants in these institutions
are anything but liberal or democratic. Consider the Soviet Union's
cooperative efforts during the Cold War. Back then, the liberal world
order was primarily an arrangement among liberal democracies in Europe,
North America, and East Asia. Even so, the Soviet Union often worked
with the democracies to help build international institutions. Moscow's
committed antiliberal stance did not stop it from partnering with
Washington to create a raft of arms control agreements. Nor did it stop
it from cooperating with Washington through the World Health
Organization to spearhead a global campaign to eradicate smallpox, which
succeeded in completely eliminating the disease by 1979. More recently,
countries of all stripes have crafted global rules to guard against
environmental destruction. The signatories to the Paris climate
agreement, for example, include such autocracies as China, Iran, and
Russia. Westphalian approaches have also thrived when it comes to
governing the commons, such as the ocean, the atmosphere, outer space,
and Antarctica. To name just one example, the 1987 Montreal Protocol,
which has thwarted the destruction of the ozone layer, has been actively
supported by democracies and dictatorships alike. Such agreements are
not challenges to the sovereignty of the states that create them but
collective measures to solve problems they cannot address on their own.
Most institutions in the liberal order do not demand that their backers
be liberal democracies; they only require that they be status quo powers
and capable of fulfilling their commitments. They do not challenge the
Westphalian system; they codify it. The un, for example, enshrines the
principle of state sovereignty and, through the permanent members of the
Security Council, the notion of great-power decision-making. All of this
makes the order more durable. Because much of international cooperation
has nothing at all to do with liberalism or democracy, when politicians
who are hostile to all things liberal are in power, they can still
retain their international agendas and keep the order alive. The
persistence of Westphalian institutions provides a lasting foundation on
which distinctively liberal and democratic institutions can be erected
in the future. [Another reason to believe that the liberal order will
endure involves the return of ideological rivalry. The last two and a
half decades have been profoundly anomalous in that liberalism has had
no credible competitor. During the rest of its existence, it faced
competition that made it stronger.]{.underline} Throughout the
nineteenth century, liberal democracies sought to outperform
monarchical, hereditary, and aristocratic regimes. During the first half
of the twentieth century, autocratic and fascist competitors created
strong incentives for the liberal democracies to get their own houses in
order and band together. And after World War II, [they built the liberal
order in part to contain the threat of the Soviet Union and
international communism.]{.underline} The Chinese Communist Party
appears increasingly likely to seek to offer an alternative to the
components of the existing order that have to do with economic
liberalism and human rights. If it ends up competing with the liberal
democracies, they will again face pressure to champion their values. [As
during the Cold War, they will have incentives to undertake domestic
reforms and strengthen their international alliances. The collapse of
the Soviet Union, although a great milestone in the annals of the
advance of liberal democracy, had the ironic effect of eliminating one
of its main drivers of solidarity.]{.underline} The bad news of renewed
ideological rivalry could be good news for the liberal international
order.

#### US-led international liberal order is sustainable -- economics and democracy

Since the middle of the twentieth century, [as American power and
influence has expanded, so have its liberal
accomplishments]{.underline}. Over seven decades under American
auspices, [the post-war liberal international order has lifted more
boats in terms of economic growth and rising incomes than any other
order in world history. It provided a framework for struggling
industrial societies in Europe and elsewhere to transform themselves
into modern social democracies]{.underline}. Japan and West Germany were
integrated into a security community and were able to fashion
distinctive national identities as peaceful great powers. Western Europe
subdued old hatreds and launched a grand project of union. [With
American prodding, European colonial rule in Africa and Asia largely
came to an end.]{.underline} The G7 system of cooperation among Japan,
Europe and North America fostered growth and managed a sequence of trade
and financial crises.61 Beginning in the 1980s, [countries across East
Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe opened up their political and
economic systems and joined the broader order]{.underline}. As the
United States experienced its greatest success as a world power with the
peaceful end to the Cold War, [countries around the globe wanted more,
not less, US leadership]{.underline}. These monumental developments are
rarely mentioned in indictments of American liberal internationalism.62
Modern liberal states are built around various values that are sometimes
in tension with one another -- liberty and equality, individualism and
community, openness and social stability, hierarchy and sovereign
equality. The Western system provided a framework within which liberal
states could manage these trade-offs. The post-war system of 'embedded
liberalism' provided mechanisms and capacities for these states to
define the terms of economic openness. Governments were given tools to
reconcile and balance the benefits of open trade with demands for
economic stability and social protection. The alliance system
facilitated sharing the costs of security protection. Alliances -- along
with the wider system of multilateral institutions -- produced greater
solidarity and community among Western and rising non-Western liberal
democracies. The bargains and institutions behind the
liberal-international order gave these states the ability to balance
hierarchy and sovereign equality. [The United States used its
pre-eminent position to underwrite and lead the order, but its binding
institutional ties with other liberal states produced a restraint on its
power]{.underline}. The fostering of cooperation among the world's
democracies did not eliminate old-style power politics, which the United
States and other liberal states continued to practise inside and outside
the Western system. But [the deep accomplishment of the post-war liberal
order was the construction of a cooperative environment in which liberal
democracies could provide tools and capacities to enable governments to
navigate economic and security interdependence, balance their often
conflicting values and principles, and secure rights and protections for
their societies]{.underline}.63 This US-led order reflected liberal
statecraft, rooted in republican and liberal theory. It was and remains
a pragmatic and reform-oriented endeavour to strengthen the ability of
liberal democracies to survive and flourish. [In a world of rising
interdependence and illiberal great-power challengers, liberal
democracies will surely want to renew rather than abandon their
distinctive, liberal-internationalist approach to order
building.64]{.underline}

#### No war -- Even if American hegemony is unsustainable, the liberal international order acts as a buffer and prevents crisis

**Ikenberry 18** -- is the Albert G. Milbank Professor of Politics and
International Affairs at Princeton University, 3/9/18 (John, \"Why the
Liberal World Order Will Survive\", Ethics & International Affairs,
Volume 32.1, accessed 6/22/22)//jd

This narrative of hegemonic rise and decline draws on the European and,
more broadly, Western experience. Since the early modern era, Europe has
been organized and reorganized by a succession of leading states and
would-be hegemons: the Spanish Hapsburgs, France of Louis XIV and
Napoleon, and post-Bismarck Germany. The logic of hegemonic order comes
even more clearly into view with Pax Britannica, the nineteenth-century
hegemonic order based on British naval and mercantile dominance. The
decline of Britain was followed by decades of war and economic
instability, which ended only with the rise of Pax Americana. For
hegemonic realists, the debate today is about where the world is along
this cyclical pathway of rise and decline. Has the United States finally
lost the ability or willingness to underwrite and lead the post-war
order? Are we in the midst of a hegemonic crisis and the breakdown of
the old order? And are rising states, led by China, beginning to step
forward in efforts to establish their own hegemonic dominance of their
regions and the world? These are the lurking questions of the power
transition perspective. But does this vision of power transition truly
illuminate the struggles going on today over international order? Some
might argue no---that the United States is still in a position, despite
its travails, to provide hegemonic leadership. Here one would note that
[there is a durable infrastructure (or what Susan Strange has called
"structural power") that undergirds the existing American-led order.
Far-flung security alliances, market relations, liberal democratic
solidarity, deeply rooted geopolitical alignments---there are many
possible sources of American hegemonic power that remain
intact.]{.underline} But there may be even deeper sources of why the
liberal world order will survive 19 continuity in the existing system.
This would be true if the existence of a liberal-oriented international
order does not in fact require hegemonic domination. It might be that
the power transition theory is wrong: [the stability and persistence of
the existing post-war international order does not depend on the
concentration of American power.]{.underline} In fact, international
order is not simply an artifact of concentrations of power. The rules
and institutions that make up international order have a more complex
and contingent relationship with the rise and fall of state power. This
is true in two respects. [First, international order itself is complex:
multilayered, multifaceted, and not simply a political formation imposed
by the leading state. International order is not "one thing" that states
either join or resist. It is an aggregation of various sorts of ordering
rules and institutions. There are the deep rules and norms of
sovereignty. There are governing institutions, starting with the United
Nations. There is a sprawling array of international institutions,
regimes, treaties, agreements, protocols, and so forth. These governing
arrangements cut across diverse realms, including security and arms
control, the world economy, the environment and global commons, human
rights, and political relations.]{.underline} Some of these domains of
governance may have rules and institutions that narrowly reflect the
interests of the hegemonic state, but [most reflect negotiated outcomes
based on a much broader set of interests]{.underline}. As [rising
states]{.underline} continue to rise, they do not simply confront an
American-led order; they [face a wider conglomeration of ordering rules,
institutions, and arrangements; many of which they have long
embrace]{.underline}d. By separating "American hegemony" from "the
existing international order," we can see a more complex set of
relationships. [The United States does not embody the international
order; it has a relationship with it, as do rising states.]{.underline}
The United States embraces many of the core global rules and
institutions, such as the United Nations, International Monetary Fund
(IMF), World Bank, and World Trade Organization. But it also has
resisted ratification of the Law of the Sea Convention and the
Convention on the Rights of the Child (it being the only country not to
have ratified the latter) as well as various arms control and
disarmament agreements. China also embraces many of the same global
rules and institutions, and resists ratification of others. Generally
speaking, the more fundamental or core the norms and institutions
are---beginning with the Westphalian norms of sovereignty and the United
Nations system---the more agreement there is between the United States
and China as well as other states. Disagreements are most salient where
human rights and political principles are in play, such as in the
Responsibility to Protect. Second, there is also diversity in what
rising states "want" from the international order. [The struggles over
international order take many different form]{.underline}s. [In some
instances, what rising states want is more influence and control of
territory and geopolitical space beyond their borders.]{.underline} One
can see this in China's efforts to expand its maritime and political
influence in the South China Sea and other neighboring areas. This is an
age-old type of struggle captured in realist accounts of security
competition and geopolitical rivalry. [Another type of struggle is over
the norms and values that are enshrined in global governance rules and
institutions.]{.underline} These may be about how open and rule-based
the system should be. They may also be about the way human rights and
political principles are defined and brought to bear in relations among
states. Finally, the struggles over international order may be focused
on the distribution of authority. That is, rising states may seek a
greater role in the governance of existing institutions. This is a
struggle over the position of states within the global political
hierarchy: voting shares, leadership rights, and authority relations.
[These observations cut against the realist hegemonic perspective and
cyclical theories of power transition. Rising states do not confront a
single, coherent, hegemonic order. The international order offers a
buffet of options and choices]{.underline}. They can embrace some rules
and institutions and not others. Moreover, stepping back, the
international orders that rising states have faced in different
historical eras have not all been the same order. The British-led order
that Germany faced at the turn of the twentieth century is different
from the international order that China faces today. [The contemporary
international order is much more complex and wide-ranging than past
orders.]{.underline} It has a much denser array of rules, institutions,
and governance realms. There are also both regional and global domains
of governance. [This makes it hard to imagine an epic moment when the
international order goes into crisis and rising states step
forward---either China alone or rising states as a bloc---to reorganize
and reshape its rules and institutions]{.underline}. Rather than a
cyclical dynamic of rise and decline, change in the existing
American-led order might best be captured by terms such as continuity,
evolution, adaptation, and negotiation. The struggles over international
order today are growing, but it is not a drama best told in terms of the
rise and decline of American hegemony.

[Within this balance-of-power alliance the United States may be
dominant, but its writ stops far short of empire. It is a hierarchical
order with liberal characteristics -- a mixed and complex system built
around institutions, bargains, partnerships, alliances and norms of
diffuse reciprocity.]{.underline}41 What is distinctive about this type
of order is that [it is bargained, with the lead state providing
services and frameworks for cooperation. In return, it invites
participation and compliance by other states, starting with the
subsystem of liberal democracie]{.underline}s. In formal terms, [there
are three features of liberal hegemony that separate it from
empire.]{.underline} Firstly, [the leading state sponsors and operates
in a system of negotiated rules and institutions. Power disparities
still afford advantages to the hegemonic state, but the arbitrary and
indiscriminate exercise of power is reined in to the degree required to
keep the order going. Secondly, the leading state provides an array of
public goods -- or club goods -- in exchange for the cooperation of
other states.]{.underline} Historically, these have included security
and support for an open trade regime.42 [Thirdly, the hegemonic order
provides channels and networks for reciprocal communication and
influence. These informal 'voice opportunities' arise from informal
access to the policymaking process of the hegemonic state and the
intergovernmental institutions that make up the system.]{.underline}43
Alliances and multilateral institutions provide mechanisms for
communication and 'pulling and hauling' between states within the
order.44 Wh[ile formal decision-making is not shared, the system works
more like a pluralist domestic regime than an empire.45 The United
States' hegemony does afford it asymmetrical power. While this leaves
partners with less influence, it also facilitates collective
decision-making.]{.underline}46 Those exhorting America to 'come home',
motivated by a critique of America as empire, are arguing for a world
order which will advance and not retard empire in the international
system. The Quincy prescription of [radically reducing the US global
footprint is an invitation to other powers to extend their imperial
reach. Other great powers, notably China and Russia, have been quite
explicit in their ambition to extend their domination of neighbouring
peoples and to create regional and world orders that reflect and support
their anti-democratic, anti-liberal and kleptocratic qualities. The
liberal order among democracies, led by the United States, remains the
best middle path between anarchy and empire.]{.underline} For the United
States to abandon it would mark a historic decline in the prospects for
individual liberty, democratic accountability and social justice.

Successive presidents have used U.S. power to bolster the international
order's rules and punish transgressors. In the seven decades since the
world shifted away from a spheres-of-influence order ruled by might
alone, [the liberal order has helped to preserve peace among the great
powers, foster economic prosperity, and facilitate the spread of
freedom. That's why Republican and Democratic presidents alike have
emphasized the importance of world order]{.underline}, while differing
in key ways about how best to shape and bolster it. Democratic U.S.
President Barack Obama's 2015 national security strategy document, for
instance, devotes an entire section to international order, stressing
the United States' obligation to reinforce and create "the rules, norms,
and institutions that are the foundation for peace, security,
prosperity," and human rights. For Republican President George W. Bush,
the goal was "to use our position of unparalleled strength and influence
to build an atmosphere of international order and openness." On the
campaign trail, [Trump articulated a very different view]{.underline}.
[Poorly negotiated trade pacts]{.underline}, he argued, [have killed
American jobs]{.underline} and sent them to lower-wage and
currency-manipulating nations. U.S. taxpayers spend billions of dollars
to uphold the country's disproportionate responsibilities, while free
riders grow prosperous off of the stability Washington provides. [The
United States takes on security responsibilities better left to
locals]{.underline}, and the effort to fill vacuums and right wrongs on
the world stage leads to misguided adventures such as the interventions
in Iraq and Libya. [Put this way, it's clear why many Americans might
reasonably conclude that the United States' traditional role in global
order is a raw deal]{.underline} and that a major course correction is
needed---and soon. Indeed, a key lesson of the presidential election is
that globalization and its current structures aren't working for a major
portion of the U.S. population. The traditional arguments used to defend
globalization have fallen flat. If the global order, buttressed by U.S.
power, purports to generate the blessings of security, prosperity, and
freedom . . . well, a lot of Americans feel they've been missing out.
They're on to something. [The international order so cherished by modern
presidents has become increasingly frayed]{.underline} in recent years.
[Russia continues to challenge basic norms of sovereignt]{.underline}y
and self-determination in eastern Europe, and [the Islamic
State]{.underline} (also known as ISIS) [has upended the notion of
borders]{.underline} in the Middle East. [China's globally competitive
state-owned enterprises have revealed gaps in global trade rules,
and]{.underline} the United States has had little recourse to stopping
its currency manipulation. Beijing's claims over virtually the entire
South China Sea and its attempts to limit freedom of navigation there
pose a serious challenge to the traditional maritime order. [North Korea
and Iran have pursued nuclear programs]{.underline} in defiance of
nonproliferation rules. Despite a formal embrace of universal human
rights by the greater international community, [freedom in the world
continues a decade long decline.]{.underline} And just at the moment
when the order needs bolstering, a number of the United States' closest
allies in Europe have embraced austerity and curtailed their spending on
defense and foreign aid. In turn, they have looked, once again, to
Washington to do the heavy lifting. [It is clearly tempting for the
United States to walk away]{.underline}. [Yet to do
so]{.underline}---or, more likely, to let the liberal order wither under
neglect---**[would be profoundly dangerous]{.underline}**. [Its creation
was a response to the destructive wars, economic depressions, and rise
of dictatorships]{.underline} that marred the first half of the
twentieth century. [**Since then, the world has seen the longest period
of great-power peace in modern history**, the largest number of people
ever pulled up from poverty, and an unprecedented expansion of

xenophobic backlash.]{.underline} Together, these developments have
called into question the legitimacy of liberal democratic life and
created openings for opportunistic demagogues. [[Just as the
causes]{.mark} of this malaise [are clear, so is its solution: a return
to the **fundamentals of liberal democracy**.]{.mark} Rather than deeply
challenging the first principles of liberal democracy]{.underline}, the
[current problems call for reforms to better realize them. To reduce
inequality, political [leaders will need to]{.mark} return
to]{.underline} the [social democratic policies]{.underline} embodied in
the New Deal, [[pass]{.mark} more progressive [taxation, and invest in
education and infrastructure.]{.mark} To foster a sense of liberal
democratic identity, they will need to [emphasize
education]{.mark}]{.underline} as a catalyst for assimilation [[and
promote national]{.mark} and public [service.]{.mark}]{.underline} In
other words, [[the remedy for]{.mark} the problems of [liberal democracy
is more liberal democracy;]{.mark} **liberalism contains the seeds of
its own salvation.**]{.underline} Indeed, [[liberal democracies have
**repeatedly recovered** from crises]{.mark} resulting from their own
excesses.]{.underline} In the 1930s, [overproduction and the
[integration]{.mark} of financial markets [brought about]{.mark} an
economic depression, which triggered]{.underline} the rise of
[[fascism]{.mark}. [But]{.mark} it [also]{.mark} triggered [the New Deal
and social democracy,]{.mark} leading to a more stable form of
capitalism.]{.underline} In the 1950s, the success of [[the Manhattan
Project]{.mark}, combined with the emerging U.S.-Soviet rivalry,
[created]{.mark} the novel [threat]{.mark} of a worldwide nuclear
holocaust. That]{.underline} threat [gave rise to arms control pacts
[and agreements concerning]{.mark} the governance of [global
spaces,]{.mark}]{.underline} deals forged by the United States in
collaboration with the Soviet Union. In the 1970s, [rising middle-class
consumption led to oil shortages, economic stagnation, and environmental
decay.]{.underline} In response, [the advanced industrial democracies
established oil coordination agreements, invested in clean energy, and
struck numerous international environmental accords aimed at reducing
pollutants. The [problems]{.mark} that liberal democracies face today,
while great, [are **certainly not more challenging**]{.mark} than those
that they have faced and overcome in these historically recent
decades.]{.underline} Of course, there is no guarantee that liberal
democracies will successfully rise to the occasion, but [to count them
out would **fly in the face** of repeated historical experiences.
Today\'s dire predictions ignore these past successes. They suffer
from]{.underline} a blinding [presentism. Taking what is new and
threatening]{.underline} as the master pattern is an understandable
reflex in the face of change, but it [is almost never a very good guide
to the future. Large-scale human arrangements such as liberal democracy
**rarely change as rapidly or as radically** as they seem to in the
moment. If history is any guide, [today\'s illiberal populists]{.mark}

A Kindleberger Trap as a Strategic Challenge?

As China's power grows, many observers worry the United States and China
are destined for war, but few consider an opposite disruptive danger in
hegemonic transitions. Rather than acting like a revolutionary power in
the international order, [China might decide to be a free rider like the
United States was in the 1930s.]{.underline} I have called this a
"Kindleberger Trap" after the renowned MIT economist who attributed [the
depths of the Great Depression and the instability of that decade to a
rising America's failure to contribute to global public goods at time
when Great Britain could no longer do so alone.25 In this version of the
failure of hegemonic power transition, China may act too weakly rather
than too strongly and refuse to contribute to an international order
that it did not create.]{.underline} Some Sinologists say that this fear
overstates the "not invented here" problem and that China knows it
benefited from the overall post-1945 international order. As Iain
Johnston has shown, one can distinguish at least eight different orders
related to eight areas of interdependence, and China's support for the
orders is medium to high in most.26

[A Kindleberger Trap is a free rider, or failure by a rising power to
contribute to global public goods.]{.underline}

To date, [China has been quite active in supporting institutions that
facilitate world order and interdependence]{.underline}. [In the UN
Security Council]{.underline}, China is one of five countries with a
veto. [China is now the second largest funder of UN peacekeeping
forces]{.underline}, participating in UN programs related to Ebola and
climate change. China has also benefited greatly from economic
institutions like the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF). On the other hand, China has started
its own Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and a "Belt and
Road" initiative (BRI) of international infrastructure projects that
some see as an economic offensive against the existing order. China has
not practiced full reciprocity as a market economy, and its rejection of
a 2016 Hague tribunal ruling regarding the South [China]{.underline} Sea
[raised questions about whether China would treat its legal
obligations]{.underline} a la carte (as the United States has sometimes
done). US and allied navies' freedom of navigation operations in the
South China Sea remain essential to maintain this point. (It would also
help if the US Senate would ratify the Law of the Sea Treaty.)

Thus far, [China has not tried to overthrow the world order from which
it benefits---rather, it has tried to increase its influence from
within---but this could change as Chinese power grows.]{.underline} The
Trump administration labeled China a revisionist power, but so far [it
is moderate revisionism]{.underline}, unlike extreme revisionist powers
such as Hitler's Germany. [China is interested not in kicking over the
card table but in tilting the table so it can claim a larger share of
the winnings. At the same time, China's growing economic power and its
tilt will create problems for the United States and the international
order.]{.underline} In other words, it may act as a free rider as the
United States did in the 1930s.

[As Chinese power grows, the American "liberal international order" will
have to change]{.underline}. It was never all liberal, orderly, or
global, and [China has little interest in liberalism or American
domination.]{.underline} Therefore, Americans would be wise to discard
the terms "liberal" and "American" and think in terms of an "open and
rules-based" world order to manage the various types of interdependence.
This would mean [framing an open international order in terms of
institutional cooperation. Ideological differences will persist, and
there will be sharp differences over values like human
rights]{.underline}, but this does not prevent negotiations and
institutions to manage interdependence.27 [The US approach to an open
international economy will need to be adjusted for greater oversight of
Chinese trade and investments that threaten our technological and
national security objectives]{.underline}, but there is still a basis
for fruitful interdependence and negotiation of rules of the road to
govern it.

Managing Interdependence

[Some degree of decoupling is bound to increase, particularly in areas
related to technology that directly affect national security. Both sides
will wish to limit vulnerabilities that endanger critical infrastructure
or have important implications for military postures]{.underline}. Some
measures will be unilateral, such as those Beijing has been undertaking
for more than a decade. [As for US measures to restrict sensitive
technology transfer via trade, investment, and scientific exchanges,
"developing a control regime that reduces risk without imposing undue
costs will not be easy."]{.underline}28

[Intricate supply chains are not easily undone. But bilateral and
multilateral negotiations can help to prevent partial technological
disengagement from degenerating into a stampede toward full
protectionism.]{.underline} One example is provided by a group of
American and Chinese [economists who have suggested a framework for
trade policy between divergent nations that distinguishes the areas
subject to bilateral negotiations from those where countries are allowed
to undertake well-calibrated domestic policy adjustments that minimize
harm to its domestic economy or security.]{.underline} Other policies
that involve damage spilling over to third countries could be handled by
multilateral arrangements.29

Negotiations can help prevent partial technological disengagement from
degenerating into a stampede.

As China, India, and other economies grow, [the US share of the world
economy will be less than it was at the beginning of this
century]{.underline}, and the rise of other countries will make it more
difficult to organize collective action to promote global public goods.
But [no other country---including China---is about to replace the United
States in terms of overall power resources in the next few decades. The
United States will continue to lead in production of global public
goods, but it will need to increasingly share that role with
China.]{.underline} Since the Nixon administration, China and the United
States have cooperated despite ideological differences. Various forms of
interdependence have grown, and efforts toward total decoupling would
involve enormous costs. While interdependence has created new strategic
vulnerabilities, it has also produced strategic opportunities.

[Rapid Asian economic growth has encouraged a power shift to the region,
but Asia has its own internal balance of power. Chinese power is
balanced by Japan, India, and Australia, among others.]{.underline} None
want to be dominated by China, though none wants to see a Cold War-style
containment strategy that would force them into an economic divorce from
China, either. [The United States will remain crucial to that Asian
balance of power. If the United States maintains those alliances, the
prospects are slight that China can drive the United States from the
Western Pacific, much less dominate the world.]{.underline} The United
States has high cards for managing the traditional competitive parts of
our cooperative rivalry with China and does not need to seek to sever
the relationship entirely by completely decoupling in a fit of panic.

[The more difficult question for an effective strategy will be whether
the United States and China can develop attitudes that allow them to
cooperate in producing global public goods and managing interdependence
while competing in other areas]{.underline}. Worst case analyses may
make such a balanced policy impossible. The US-China relationship is a
cooperative rivalry where a successful strategy of "smart competition,"
as advocated by Orville Schell and Susan Shirk, will require equal
attention to both aspects of that description.30 But such a future will
require good contextual intelligence and careful management of all
dimensions of our interdependence, both negative and positive.
[Exaggerated fears will make such a balanced policy difficult, and hasty
efforts to decouple will lead to a failed strategy that reduces US
power.]{.underline}

**[China's neighbors can check Chinese maritime expansion and will
remain ca¬pable of doing so for the foreseeable future.]{.underline}**
Given this regional balance of power, [the United States should adopt an
"active denial" strategy to preserve the territorial status quo in East
Asia. The strategy would aim to raise the costs of military aggression
for China, without backing it into a corner, and would have three main
elements. First, the United States would bolster the A2/AD capabilities
of China's neighbors by providing them with loans, arms, training, and
intelligence.]{.underline} The goal would be to turn China's neighbors
into prickly "porcupines," capable of denying territory to China but not
of taking and holding terri¬tory themselves.168 [Second, the United
States would create buffers between U.S. and Chinese forces by
stationing most U.S. forces in hardened bases scattered around the East
Asian periphery]{.underline}, where they could be called upon in the
event of war but otherwise kept beyond the reach of most of China's
forces.169 Decreasing the number of U.S. forces near China's borders
would reduce the likelihood of air and naval clashes, help reassure
China that the United States does not intend to launch massive strikes
on the Chinese mainland at the outset of a crisis, and increase the
resilience of U.S. forces in the region by reducing their exposure to
Chinese preemptive attacks. [Third, the United States would backstop the
local balance of power in war-time, but would plan to do so
gradually.]{.underline} In minor conflicts, the United States would try
to convince China to back down by using nonmilitary forms of
coer-cion.170 The United States is uniquely empowered to impose
financial sanc¬tions and embargoes on hostile countries (and to deny
enemies the ability to respond in kind) because of its central role in
global banking, plentiful energy resources, and unparalleled ability to
disrupt international shipping and communications networks.171 In the
initial stages of a conflict, therefore, [the United States could use
financial sanctions, embargoes, or cyber operations to try to achieve
"victory without violence,"]{.underline} as it did in compelling Iran to
ne¬gotiate curbs on its nuclear program and in deterring Russia from
annexing eastern Ukraine.172 If the conflict escalated to war, [the
United States could initially "lead from behind,"]{.underline}
supporting local forces with logistics, intelligence, and, if absolutely
necessary, limited air and missile strikes on Chinese forces operating
in the combat theater rather than those stationed on the Chinese
mainland. These strikes could be conducted from submarines, stealth
aircraft, or road-mobile shore-based missile batteries strung along the
first island chain---all of which are far less vulnerable to Chinese
A2/AD forces than surface ships and non-stealth aircraft. [If the United
States needed to ratchet up the pain, it could es-calate horizontally
before doing so vertically]{.underline}---that is, by opening new
geographic fronts (e.g., by blockading the Strait of Malacca) rather
than pour-ing U.S. forces into the main combat theater. [This strategy
obviously sacrifices military effectiveness for the sake of en-hancing
crisis stability.]{.underline} The U.S. military could gain a major
advantage over the PLA if it simply unloaded on China's bases, missile
batteries, satellites, and radar installations at the outset of a
conflict. The U.S. military generally favors this type of
knock-out-punch strategy and for good reason: pinprick strikes and
gradual escalation invite a grinding war of attrition. [Why give the
enemy a chance to fight back?]{.underline} Offensive doctrines make
sense against weak states that do not have nuclear weapons. Against
China, however, [a military posture primed for rapid escala¬tion could
be a recipe for disaster.]{.underline} For starters, an offensive
posture risks turning minor disputes into major wars. China might be
tempted to shoot first during a crisis, in a desperate at-tempt to stun
the United States before the U.S. military wipes out the PLA's offensive
forces.173 The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and China's interven-tion
in the Korean War are just two examples of this "use it or lose it"
logic in action. In the years ahead, many events can, and almost surely
will, spark crises between the United States and China; the two
countries have long¬standing disputes over freedom of navigation, North
Korea, Taiwan, and human rights, among other issues. A sensible U.S.
security policy, therefore, must balance the need to deter China with
the need to prevent disputes from escalating. Second, an offensive U.S.
posture vis-à-vis China risks turning conventional wars into nuclear
wars.174 Some of the systems that support China's conven¬tional military
forces---missile batteries, radars, satellites, submarines---also
support its nuclear arsenal, so Chinese leaders might mistake U.S.
strikes on these systems as a preemptive attack on China's nuclear
deterrent. Moreover, some PLA officials have suggested that China would
use nuclear weapons to retaliate against a conventional attack on its
homeland. Perhaps these declara- tions are bluffs, but is it really so
hard to imagine that, in the heat of battle and when facing the
potential loss of its offensive forces, China might fire off a nu¬clear
weapon in the hopes of shocking the United States into a cease-fire? [If
China were poised to overrun East Asia, then it might make sense for the
United States to risk nuclear war to check Chinese
expansion.]{.underline} Better to address the problem than repeat the
mistakes of the interwar period and appease ag¬gressors. [**China**,
however, **is incapable of going on an Imperial Japan--style rampage
across East Asia**, so the stakes for the United States in a war between
China and its neighbors would be moderate, and **the main danger would
be in doing too much rather than too little.**]{.underline}175 Instead
of rushing into a war with China, therefore, the United States should
pick its battles selectively, escalate gradually, and let local actors
do most of the heavy lifting. Some scholars argue that the United States
should simply pull U.S. forces out of East Asia and hand over all
responsibility for balancing China to local actors.176 [Retrenchment,
however, not only would reduce U.S. influence in the region, but also
degrade crisis stability by undermining deterrence.]{.underline} China
might be emboldened by a U.S. withdrawal from East Asia and ramp up
coer¬cive pressure on its demoralized neighbors. As Thomas Christensen
has shown, successful security policy requires a balance of reassurance
and deter-rence.177 Retrenchment is skewed too heavily toward the
former. [**An active denial strategy, therefore, remains the United
States' best defense policy toward China**. The strategy maintains
deterrence, by reducing China's ability to achieve a quick military
victory, while enhancing crisis stability, by reassuring China that it
will not be cold-cocked on the first day of a war.]{.underline} Compared
to slaying the forces of fascism and communism, [stabilizing East Asia
is an admittedly underwhelming call to greatness.]{.underline} It is not
a mission that Americans are any more eager to undertake than the great
geopolitical cam¬paigns of the twentieth century. But it is just as
virtuous and just as vital.

[Understanding power and interdependence in the US-China relationship
depends on understanding strategic objectives. If the US relationship
with China is zero sum and China's long-term objective is to destroy it,
much like the aspirations of Hitler's Germany]{.underline} in the 1930s,
then the less interdependence the better---though, as we have seen, some
will be unavoidable. [If, on the other hand, the relationship is more a
mixed game or a cooperative rivalry in which coexistence is built into
the environment, then US strategic objectives must include stability as
well as competition, and interdependence can be used for both
cooperative and rivalrous goals]{.underline}.

[Deterrence is one example of when interdependence can be beneficial to
enhance cooperative goals. Entanglement, or the existence of various
interdependences, can mean that an attack would cause serious costs to
both the attacker and target]{.underline}; it can mean that [there are
benefits to continuing the status quo]{.underline}. In other words,
[entanglement is an important means of making an actor perceive that the
costs of an action will exceed the benefits, thus contributing to
deterrence]{.underline}.

Entanglement is an important means of contributing to deterrence.

In 2009, for example, [the People's Liberation Army urged the Chinese
government to sell some of China's massive holdings of dollars to punish
the United States for selling arms to Taiwan. China's Central Bank
pointed out, however, that doing so would impose large costs on China.
As a result, the government was deterred from selling the holdings and
ultimately sided with the Central Bank. Similarly, in scenarios that
envisage a Chinese cyberattack on the US power grid imposing great costs
on the US economy, the two countries' economic interdependence would
mean costly damage to China as well.]{.underline} Precision targeting of
minor economic targets might not produce much direct blowback in the
absence of retaliation, but the rising importance of the internet to
economic growth increases general incentives for self-restraint. [The
legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party depends heavily upon economic
growth, and Chinese economic growth increasingly depends upon the
internet]{.underline}.11

[Critics of unsophisticated claims that economic interdependence causes
peace point to World War I as evidence that economic ties did not
prevent catastrophic war among major trading partners.]{.underline} Such
criticisms go too far, however, in dismissing any possibility that
[states will take interdependence into account and thus reduce the
probability of conflict.]{.underline} Norman Angell and others were
wrong to argue before World War I that [economic
interdependence]{.underline} had made war impossible, but they were not
wrong that it [had greatly increased war's cost.]{.underline}12 The
preceding examples of [China's behavior reveal that policymakers do take
interdependence into account.]{.underline} Of course, conflict is always
possible because of human miscalculation. Most European leaders in 1914
incorrectly envisaged a short war with limited costs, and it is doubtful
that the kaiser, the czar, and the Austro-Hungarian emperor would have
made the decision to go to war if they had foreseen the loss of their
thrones and dismemberment of their empires. Miscalculation and accident
can undercut any type of deterrence. [Trade between the United States
and Japan did not prevent the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor.]{.underline} Indeed, the attack was caused, in part, by the US
embargo of exports to Japan. The embargo manipulated the asymmetrical
US-Japan interdependence in a way that led the Japanese to fear that
failing to take a risky alternative would lead to their strangulation.

[An international deterrent relationship is an intricate set of repeated
interactions between complex organizations that are not always unitary
actors.]{.underline} These actors can adjust their perceptions in
non-homogeneous ways over time, as has been the case in the US-China
economic relationship. Deterrence rests on various means: punishment,
denial, entanglement, and norms. As Robert Axelrod notes in his classic
work on cooperation, iterative relationships can develop a long shadow
of the future that can lead to cooperative restraint in prisoner's
dilemma games.13 [In addition, some interdependence is systemic, in
which a state has a general interest in not upsetting the status quo and
may develop interests in systemic stability.]{.underline} Of course,
interdependence is a two-edged sword, and [entanglement]{.underline} is
not the most important cause of deterrence, but it can be easy to
overlook the fact that, if carefully wielded, it [can also contribute to
deterrence and stability.]{.underline}

Dimensions of US-China Interdependence There are many strands of
interdependence in the US-China relationship, and the symmetry of
vulnerability varies with each one. Former Australia Prime Minister
Kevin Rudd recently summarized six different dimensions.9 Trade Over the
past decade, the United States received 19 percent of China's exports,
while China represented only 8 percent of US total exports. [China's
leadership knows that the United States can inflict more damage on China
from trade than vice versa, but they also know that US consumers are
dependent on a range of goods that cannot be readily replaced in the
near-term.]{.underline} Thus, despite a two to one asymmetry, "America
does not have all the cards in this game, and China knows it."10 There
are limits to the power that comes from asymmetrical interdependence.
Foreign Direct Investment In 2019, the total stock of US FDI in China
reached US\$269 billion while Chinese FDI in the United States reached
US\$145 billion, but [annual flow rates have been decreasing as distrust
on both sides tightens policy constraints. Rudd concludes that
decoupling is happening in this area more rapidly than
expected.]{.underline} Technology China's program "Made in China 2025"
and the goal to be first in Artificial Intelligence by 2030 have led
t[he American government and companies to be more wary about a high
degree of technology interdependence with China.]{.underline} Rudd
concludes that [a significant degree of technological decoupling is
underway]{.underline} and that it "began nearly two decades ago when
China decided to embark on internet sovereignty to restrict the free
flow of information to its citizens." A significant degree of technology
decoupling is underway. Capital Markets [The overall financial
relationship is over US\$5 trillion, including nearly two trillion in
Chinese listings on US stock exchanges and US\$l.3 trillion in Chinese
official holdings of US government bonds.]{.underline} Rudd argues that
"whatever strategic difficulties these two governments may have with
each other, it continues to be in each countries' interests to maintain
these arrangements." In other words, [little decoupling.]{.underline}
Currency Markets While China would like to see the yuan play a larger
role in world markets, it is unwilling to make the domestic reforms to
create deep and flexible convertible currency markets and a rule of law
needed for the yuan to become a major reserve currency. Only 2 percent
of global reserves are held in yuan; [62 percent are held in US dollars.
The status quo will persist for a time.]{.underline} Education,
Research, and Talent Over three million [Chinese students have been
educated in American universities over the past 20 years, and over
350,000 Chinese students study in the US each year.]{.underline} Over
the past two years, however, there was a decline in international
enrollments in American universities, and policy changes have made
various types of visas more difficult to obtain. Rudd concludes that
[there are early signs of decoupling in the area of talent.]{.underline}
Military [There are other dimensions of interdependence in addition to
the economic ones surveyed by Rudd, and they include military and
environmental interdependence. In military terms, both countries hold
each other hostage in nuclear deterrence, and despite the aspirations
for strategic missile defense technology, it is unlikely that this
relationship can be decoupled]{.underline} (for one thing, there are
many ways to deliver weapons of mass destruction). Moreover, [both
countries are positively interdependent in slowing the spread of such
weapons.]{.underline} Previously a one-time proliferator, China has
become a supporter of the international non-proliferation regime.
Environmental In the case of the environment, scientific evidence shows
that climate change can do great damage to both countries. For example,
melting glaciers in the Himalayas as well as in Greenland could inflict
serious costs. China has now surpassed the United States as the largest
producer of greenhouse gases, and together, China and the United States
produce 40 percent of the global total. Neither country can solve this
problem alone, nor can either decouple from it. Climate change obeys the
laws of physics, not politics. And the 2020 coronavirus reminds us that
pandemics respond to the laws of biology. Alt[hough epidemiological
interdependence is asymmetrical, using it as a strategic weapon instead
of cooperating would run a high risk of unintended consequences with
uncertain strategic gains.]{.underline} Overall, [while some types of
interdependence produce asymmetrical vulnerabilities that can be used as
weapons, other types produce a mutual vulnerability that is difficult to
escape without cooperative measures. If power is the ability to affect
others to get the outcomes one wants, it is important to distinguish
power over others from power with others. In some instances, such as
climate change, power over interdependence can only be obtained with
others.]{.underline} It is important to distinguish power over others
from power with others.

[A Thucydides Trap as a Strategic Challenge?]{.underline}

[Failure of the United States to successfully cope with the rise of
China could have disastrous consequences for the United States and the
rest of the world. Ever since the Peloponnesian war, realists have
warned that the interaction of an established power and a rising power
could lead to miscalculations that could disrupt this century, much as
the last century was devastated in 1914. Graham Allison has recently
labelled this strategic problem a "Thucydides Trap" and asserted that it
has occurred in 12 out of 16 cases of hegemonic transition in recent
history.]{.underline}14 While his numbers have been contested, the
strategic problem has long been recognized.15

To avoid such an outcome, [a successful US strategy on China must
neither over nor underestimate Chinese power.]{.underline}
Underestimation breeds complacency, while overestimation creates
fear---either of which can lead to miscalculation. Contrary to current
conventional wisdom, China has not yet replaced the United States as the
world's largest economy. Measured in purchasing power parity, the
Chinese economy became larger than the American economy in 2014, but
purchasing power parity is an economist's device for comparing estimates
of welfare, not for measuring power. Current exchange rates are a better
measure of power, and they show that China is about two-thirds the size
of the United States. Many economists do expect China to surpass the
United States someday as the world's largest economy (measured as GDP in
dollars), but the estimated date varies from 2030 to midcentury
depending on what one assumes about the rates of Chinese and American
growth. Moreover, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a crude measure of
power. Including per capita income gives a better index of the
sophistication of an economy, and US per capita income is many times
that of China's. By any measure, however, the gravitational pull of
China's economy is increasing, and China is rising.

A successful US strategy on China must neither over nor underestimate
Chinese power.

[Thucydides famously attributed the Peloponnesian war to two causes: the
rise of a new power and the fear that an established power
creates.]{.underline} Most analysts focus on the first half of his
statement, but the second is more within our control. [It is unlikely
that US foreign policy can prevent the rise of China's economy, but the
United States can avoid exaggerated fears that could create a new cold
or hot war if it uses contextual intelligence well. Even if China
someday passes the United States in total economic size, there are other
measures of geopolitical power. China is well behind the United States
on military and soft power indices.]{.underline} US military expenditure
is several times that of China's. While Chinese military capabilities
have been increasing in recent years and pose new challenges to US
forces, analysts who look carefully at the military balance conclude
that China is not a global peer and will not be able to exclude the
United States from the Western Pacific so long as the United States
maintains its alliance and bases in Japan. And opinion polls as well as
a recent index published by Portland, a London consultancy, ranked China
in twenty-sixth place in soft power, while the United States ranked near
the top.16 Mao's Communism had a far greater transnational soft power
appeal in the 1960s than "Xi Jinping thought" does today.

On the other hand, China's huge economic scale matters. The United
States was once the world's largest trading nation and largest bilateral
lender---in 2001, more than 80 percent of countries traded more with the
United States than with China. By 2018, only 30 percent reported the
same, with 128 out of 190 countries trading more with China than with
the United States.17 China plans to lend more than a trillion dollars
for infrastructure projects with its "Belt and Road" initiative over the
next decade, while the United States has cut back aid. [China's economic
success story enhances its soft power, and government control of access
to its large market provides hard-power leverage. Moreover, China's
authoritarian politics and mercantilist practices make its economic
power readily usable by the government. China will gain economic power
from the sheer size of its market as well as its overseas investments
and development assistance.]{.underline} Of the seven giant global
companies in the age of Artificial Intelligence (Google, Facebook,
Amazon, Microsoft, Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent), nearly half are
Chinese. With its large population and [data resources that are becoming
the "new oil" of world politics]{.underline}, China is poised to become
the Saudi Arabia of big data.18

[The United States has some long-term power advantages that will persist
regardless of current Chinese actions. One is geography. The United
States is surrounded by oceans and neighbors that are likely to remain
friendly; China has borders with fourteen countries and has territorial
disputes with India, Japan, and Vietnam that set limits on its soft
power. Energy is another American advantage. A decade ago, the United
States seemed hopelessly dependent on imported energy. Now, the shale
revolution has transformed it from an energy importer to exporter, and
North America may be self-sufficient in the coming decade.19 At the same
time, China is becoming more dependent on energy imports, and much of
the oil it imports is transported through the Indian Ocean and the South
China Sea, where the United States and others maintain a significant
naval presence. Eliminating this vulnerability will take decades. As we
have seen, the United States enjoys financial power derived from its
large transnational financial institutions. Although the dollar cannot
remain pre-eminent forever, the yuan is unlikely to displace the dollar
as a reserve currency in the near term.]{.underline}

[The United States also has demographic strengths. It is the only major
developed country that is currently projected to hold its place (third)
in the demographic ranking of countries.]{.underline} While the rate of
US population growth has slowed in recent years, it is not shrinking in
population as will happen to Russia, Europe, and Japan. Seven of the
world's fifteen largest economies will face a shrinking workforce over
the next decade and a half, but the US workforce is likely to increase
by 5 percent while China's will decline by 9 percent. China will soon
lose its first place population rank to India, and its working age
population already peaked in 2015.20 Chinese citizens sometimes say they
worry about "growing old before growing rich."

[The United States has been at the forefront in the development of key
technologies (bio, nano, and information) that are central to this
century's economic growth, and US research universities dominate higher
education.]{.underline} In a 2019 ranking by Shanghai Jiaotong
University, eighteen of the top twenty-five global universities were in
the United States; none were in China.21 At the same time, China is
investing heavily in research and development and competes well in some
fields now, including artificial intelligence.22 Given the importance of
machine learning as a general-purpose technology that affects many
domains, China's gains in AI are of particular significance. Chinese
technological progress is no longer based solely on imitation. However,
[a successful US response to China's technological challenge will depend
more upon improvements at home than upon external sanctions. US
complacency is always a danger, but so is lack of confidence and
exaggerated fears that lead to overreaction.]{.underline} In the view of
John Deutch, former provost of MIT, if the United States attains its
innovation potential, "China's great leap forward will likely at best be
a few steps toward closing the innovation leadership gap that the United
States currently enjoys."23

In short, [the United States holds high cards in its poker hand, but
hysteria could cause it to play its cards ineffectively.]{.underline}
When the Clinton administration published its East Asian Strategy Report
in 1995, it decided to reaffirm the US-Japan alliance well before
seeking to engage China in the WTO. The US approach to the rise of China
was to engage but hedge its bets first. Discarding its high cards of
alliances and international institutions would be a serious mistake. If
the United States maintains its alliance with Japan, China cannot push
beyond the first island chain because Japan is a major part of that
chain. Another possible mistake would be to try to cut off all
immigration. When asked why he did not think China would pass the United
States in total power any time soon, former Singapore Prime Minister Lee
Kuan Yew cited [the ability of the United States to draw upon the
talents of the whole world and recombine them in diversity and
creativity that was not possible for China's ethnic Han nationalism. If
the United States were to discard its high cards of external alliances
and domestic openness]{.underline}, Lee could be wrong.24

### 2AC\-\--No China Transition

#### Hegemonic power transition to China won't happen - its neighbors check naval expansion

Naval Expansion",

**[China's neighbors can check Chinese maritime expansion and will
remain ca¬pable of doing so for the foreseeable future.]{.underline}**
Given this regional balance of power, [the United States should adopt an
"active denial" strategy to preserve the territorial status quo in East
Asia. The strategy would aim to raise the costs of military aggression
for China, without backing it into a corner, and would have three main
elements. First, the United States would bolster the A2/AD capabilities
of China's neighbors by providing them with loans, arms, training, and
intelligence.]{.underline} The goal would be to turn China's neighbors
into prickly "porcupines," capable of denying territory to China but not
of taking and holding terri¬tory themselves.168 [Second, the United
States would create buffers between U.S. and Chinese forces by
stationing most U.S. forces in hardened bases scattered around the East
Asian periphery]{.underline}, where they could be called upon in the
event of war but otherwise kept beyond the reach of most of China's
forces.169 Decreasing the number of U.S. forces near China's borders
would reduce the likelihood of air and naval clashes, help reassure
China that the United States does not intend to launch massive strikes
on the Chinese mainland at the outset of a crisis, and increase the
resilience of U.S. forces in the region by reducing their exposure to
Chinese preemptive attacks. [Third, the United States would backstop the
local balance of power in war-time, but would plan to do so
gradually.]{.underline} In minor conflicts, the United States would try
to convince China to back down by using nonmilitary forms of
coer-cion.170 The United States is uniquely empowered to impose
financial sanc¬tions and embargoes on hostile countries (and to deny
enemies the ability to respond in kind) because of its central role in
global banking, plentiful energy resources, and unparalleled ability to
disrupt international shipping and communications networks.171 In the
initial stages of a conflict, therefore, [the United States could use
financial sanctions, embargoes, or cyber operations to try to achieve
"victory without violence,"]{.underline} as it did in compelling Iran to
ne¬gotiate curbs on its nuclear program and in deterring Russia from
annexing eastern Ukraine.172 If the conflict escalated to war, [the
United States could initially "lead from behind,"]{.underline}
supporting local forces with logistics, intelligence, and, if absolutely
necessary, limited air and missile strikes on Chinese forces operating
in the combat theater rather than those stationed on the Chinese
mainland. These strikes could be conducted from submarines, stealth
aircraft, or road-mobile shore-based missile batteries strung along the
first island chain---all of which are far less vulnerable to Chinese
A2/AD forces than surface ships and non-stealth aircraft. [If the United
States needed to ratchet up the pain, it could es-calate horizontally
before doing so vertically]{.underline}---that is, by opening new
geographic fronts (e.g., by blockading the Strait of Malacca) rather
than pour-ing U.S. forces into the main combat theater. [This strategy
obviously sacrifices military effectiveness for the sake of en-hancing
crisis stability.]{.underline} The U.S. military could gain a major
advantage over the PLA if it simply unloaded on China's bases, missile
batteries, satellites, and radar installations at the outset of a
conflict. The U.S. military generally favors this type of
knock-out-punch strategy and for good reason: pinprick strikes and
gradual escalation invite a grinding war of attrition. [Why give the
enemy a chance to fight back?]{.underline} Offensive doctrines make
sense against weak states that do not have nuclear weapons. Against
China, however, [a military posture primed for rapid escala¬tion could
be a recipe for disaster.]{.underline} For starters, an offensive
posture risks turning minor disputes into major wars. China might be
tempted to shoot first during a crisis, in a desperate at-tempt to stun
the United States before the U.S. military wipes out the PLA's offensive
forces.173 The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and China's interven-tion
in the Korean War are just two examples of this "use it or lose it"
logic in action. In the years ahead, many events can, and almost surely
will, spark crises between the United States and China; the two
countries have long¬standing disputes over freedom of navigation, North
Korea, Taiwan, and human rights, among other issues. A sensible U.S.
security policy, therefore, must balance the need to deter China with
the need to prevent disputes from escalating. Second, an offensive U.S.
posture vis-à-vis China risks turning conventional wars into nuclear
wars.174 Some of the systems that support China's conven¬tional military
forces---missile batteries, radars, satellites, submarines---also
support its nuclear arsenal, so Chinese leaders might mistake U.S.
strikes on these systems as a preemptive attack on China's nuclear
deterrent. Moreover, some PLA officials have suggested that China would
use nuclear weapons to retaliate against a conventional attack on its
homeland. Perhaps these declara- tions are bluffs, but is it really so
hard to imagine that, in the heat of battle and when facing the
potential loss of its offensive forces, China might fire off a nu¬clear
weapon in the hopes of shocking the United States into a cease-fire? [If
China were poised to overrun East Asia, then it might make sense for the
United States to risk nuclear war to check Chinese
expansion.]{.underline} Better to address the problem than repeat the
mistakes of the interwar period and appease ag¬gressors. [**China**,
however, **is incapable of going on an Imperial Japan--style rampage
across East Asia**, so the stakes for the United States in a war between
China and its neighbors would be moderate, and **the main danger would
be in doing too much rather than too little.**]{.underline}175 Instead
of rushing into a war with China, therefore, the United States should
pick its battles selectively, escalate gradually, and let local actors
do most of the heavy lifting. Some scholars argue that the United States
should simply pull U.S. forces out of East Asia and hand over all
responsibility for balancing China to local actors.176 [Retrenchment,
however, not only would reduce U.S. influence in the region, but also
degrade crisis stability by undermining deterrence.]{.underline} China
might be emboldened by a U.S. withdrawal from East Asia and ramp up
coer¬cive pressure on its demoralized neighbors. As Thomas Christensen
has shown, successful security policy requires a balance of reassurance
and deter-rence.177 Retrenchment is skewed too heavily toward the
former. [**An active denial strategy, therefore, remains the United
States' best defense policy toward China**. The strategy maintains
deterrence, by reducing China's ability to achieve a quick military
victory, while enhancing crisis stability, by reassuring China that it
will not be cold-cocked on the first day of a war.]{.underline} Compared
to slaying the forces of fascism and communism, [stabilizing East Asia
is an admittedly underwhelming call to greatness.]{.underline} It is not
a mission that Americans are any more eager to undertake than the great
geopolitical cam¬paigns of the twentieth century. But it is just as
virtuous and just as vital.

#### American leadership in Asia-Pacific key to China deterrence 

**Hass 17 -** served as the director for China, Taiwan and Mongolia at
the National Security Council (NSC) staff and served as a Foreign
Service Officer in U.S. Embassy Beijing, 12/29/17 (Ryan, Brookings,

There is a sense that the U.S. has pressing needs at home, that the
North Korea challenge feels dangerous and intractable, and that China's
national power is on the rise --- so China or others should do more to
manage problems in their own backyard. While I support focusing on
getting our house in order at home, I fear that [it would be dangerously
shortsighted for the U.S. to retreat from its 70-plus-year status as the
leading power and agenda-setter in the Asia-Pacific region.]{.underline}
We have to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. Here's why:
First, [the Asia-Pacific region is rapidly becoming the most important
area in the world for the U.S. It accounts for nearly 60 percent of
global economic growth]{.underline}, and U.S. exports to the region
create more jobs (3.4 million) than any other part of the world. It is
home to five U.S. treaty allies, many of the world's most capable
militaries and the most proximate threat to America's national security:
North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. [When America has been
active in the region, it has spurred Asian countries to share the burden
in responding to humanitarian disasters, dealing with climate change,
increasing pressure on North Korea and agreeing on trade rules for
nearly 40 percent of the global economy]{.underline}. At the same time,
the U.S. has led efforts to push China to emerge as a constructive ---
and not a coercive --- actor. [If the U.S. withdraws from these roles,
there is no other country capable of pulling the region together in
common purpose to address shared challenge]{.underline}s. Second,
[America's long and steady presence in the region has helped deter
aggression, cool historical rivalries, and support the spread of
market-based democracies]{.underline}. While the people of the region
deserve credit, [the U.S.-provided security umbrella also enabled
progress]{.underline}. Up to now, [the U.S. has served as a buffer in
regional disputes, and a check **against China or others seeking to use
their military to move borders or seize resources**. If confidence in
U.S. resolve to protect the peace recedes, **the risk of interstate
conflict will rise**. Countries will confront a choice between becoming
more deferential to Beijing's interests in exchange for hoped-for
security and economic benefits, or developing military capabilities ---
including nuclear weapons --- to guard against coercion by China or
North Korea. If Japan goes nuclear, for example, South Korea and Taiwan
could follow. A pattern of nuclear dominoes would **elevate risk of a
catastrophic conflict that could crater the global economy and create
unimaginable destruction**.]{.underline}

### 2AC\-\--No China Rise

#### No China rise -- failing economy, population loss, and lagging technology prove

[China's ascendance shook the world intellectually as well as
geopolitically]{.underline}: It undermined post-Cold War Western beliefs
that prosperity would lead inevitably to political liberalization, that
democracies produced higher rates of growth than autocracies, and that
tyranny was incompatible with sound economic management. As China became
a global heavyweight, a [new orthodoxy solidified---that a hegemonic
transition was approaching as Beijing surpassed the United
States.]{.underline} One dissenter was the political scientist David
Shambaugh. In 2015, Shambaugh argued that [China was suffering from a
deep internal malaise and that Xi's increasingly repressive rule was a
sign of insecurity]{.underline}, not confidence. "\[F\]or all the
Western views of it as an unstoppable juggernaut," he wrote[, China's
economy "is stuck in a series of **systemic traps** from which there is
no easy exit."]{.underline} Shambaugh struck a discordant note at a time
when Beijing was tightening its control of the South China Sea and
spreading its influence across multiple continents. He also happened to
be right. Not least of the oddities surrounding contemporary China is
that much of the world deemed its ascent inevitable just as its
prospects started to dim. This may sound absurd, given all the hype
surrounding China's rise. After all, that country is supposedly
destined, as the Harvard University political scientist [Graham Allison
(channeling legendary Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew) has
written, to become "the biggest player in the history of the
world."]{.underline} It's true that China does boast many apparent
advantages. It has an enormous domestic market and is the leading trade
partner of roughly 130 countries around the world. It is making
concerted investments in artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductors,
and other critical technologies. If the United States doesn't up its
game, a national commission chaired by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt
warned in 2021, China could become the premier "AI superpower." [But
look closer, and China's trajectory starts to seem more
tenuous.]{.underline} [For one thing, many of China's technological
achievements are narrower and less impressive than they first appear.
For example, Beijing has made great strides in AI applications focused
on surveillance (no surprise there), but the United States still **leads
significantly** across the wider expanse of AI subfields and uses.
Despite vast state subsidies, China's Semiconductor Manufacturing
International Corp. is **years behind** in the creation of cutting-edge
semiconductors that make up the foundation of advanced economies in the
information age.]{.underline} Just this year, Peking University
published a candid assessment---which the CCP then predictably
censored---of China's progress in science and technology. [The verdict
was that China is "following \[the United States\] in most fields,
running side by side in a few, and leading in very few."]{.underline}
And while China's other strengths are not illusory, neither can they
hide a reality that Beckley and I discussed last year: [The magic that
made China's economic miracle is unmistakably fizzling.]{.underline} The
country's resource abundance is old news: [Overuse devastated much of
China's arable land; industrialization and pollution left the country
with severe water scarcity. More damaging still, China's abundance of
human resources is also a thing of the past. The one-child policy was a
devil's bargain that is now causing demographic implosion]{.underline}.
China's total population is set to peak by 2028 (or perhaps as soon as
this year, by some estimates) and then plummet by as much as half by
century's end. Its working population crested in 2015; it will fall by
70 million between 2020 and 2035 and even faster after that. [China will
soon combine an enormous geriatric population with a rapidly shrinking
workforce. It will experience one of the worst peacetime demographic
crunches on record, a formula for stagnation at best and **catastrophic
economic contraction** at worst.]{.underline} Making matters worse, the
era of enlightened economic policy is over. The reform agenda has been
stalled for more than a decade because further
liberalization---necessary to make the leap to a more innovative,
knowledge-based economy---would threaten the privileges of entrenched
elites. [If anything, Xi has thrown the country into reverse.
Politically, he is taking China into neototalitarianism through
pervasive repression and indoctrination. And economically, his policies
have a decidedly retrograde feel.]{.underline} Xi's agenda has featured
a preference for state-owned enterprises at the expense of the more
vibrant private sector; the imposition of severe, politically motivated
restrictions on wide swaths of the economy; attacks on the autonomy of
relatively technocratic institutions such as the central bank; and the
empowerment of political minders in companies of nearly all sizes.
China's leaders may talk about the need to transition to a high-tech,
services-based economy, but [Xi's policies are stifling the competence,
creativity, and spontaneity necessary to make that shift. It all
constitutes a "great leap backward"---a reversion to pre-Deng-era
policies that condemned China to stagnation.]{.underline} There is also
the question of what Xi's consolidation of power means for the country's
long-term resilience. As the political theorist Francis Fukuyama has
written, for nearly 40 years after Mao's death China avoided the "bad
emperor" problem---the worst pathologies that accompany authoritarian
rule---by imposing term limits on its rulers and making them more
accountable to other CCP elites. [Yet Xi has systematically disassembled
this system by purging rivals, sidelining potential successors, and
entrenching himself in power.]{.underline} By doing so, he is enabling
China to move faster and more decisively. [But he is also leaving the
country vulnerable to impulsive or unwise decision-making---a perpetual
problem of one-man rule---and creating the potential for terrible
instability when his reign finally ends. Xi's centralization of
authority, while seemingly impressive, is setting the country up for a
fall.]{.underline} Finally, it doesn't help that a more assertive [China
is now facing more international resistance. Trade barriers against
Chinese companies and products proliferated in the decade after the
global financial crisis. Washington has waged a technological cold war
against Huawei, seeking to deprive that Chinese firm of high-end
semiconductors and keep it out of the world's 5G networks. Dozens of
countries are more carefully scrutinizing their economic, financial, and
technological ties with Beijing; the Japanese government is offering to
pay companies to reduce their China exposure.]{.underline} China is
still central to the global economy, but the days when the United States
and other powerful countries eagerly abetted its ascent are over.
Indeed, Xi's effort to cultivate the domestic market is an implicit
admission that China, which rose on the strength of an export-focused
economy, now confronts a very different world. China's predicament has
been thrown into relief, ironically, by COVID-19. Early on, the pandemic
seemed to herald an epochal global shift. Prominent U.S. analysts saw it
as a "Suez moment," the terminal crisis of the U.S. empire. Xi touted
his regime's success in containing COVID-19 at home (albeit after
allowing it to escape to the world) as an advertisement for Chinese
authoritarianism. Two years later, it's clear that COVID-19 was a
turning point but not in the way that Xi hoped. The pandemic
hypercharged global anti-China sentiment, after Beijing concealed the
initial outbreak and then exploited the resulting chaos to bully nations
from Australia to Germany and the United Kingdom. [It thereby encouraged
a host of efforts---through multilateral institutions such as the
Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, AUKUS, and the G-7, as well as the
United States' bilateral alliances in the Pacific---to counter Chinese
power. "A Cold War mentality" had reemerged, a spokesperson for China's
foreign ministry complained, as the United States and its friends
pursued "anti-China encirclement."]{.underline} [COVID-19 also confirmed
how patchy China's rise had been: The country's biotechnology sector
couldn't produce anything like the revolutionary vaccines that
democratic innovation economies in the United States and Europe churned
out.]{.underline} Even China's heavy-handed success in containing
COVID-19 at home became a trap: [The combination of "zero-COVID"
policies, low levels of natural immunity, and vaccines that proved weak
or worthless against highly contagious variants condemned the country to
recurring lockdowns of major cities, with all the accompanying
disruptions.]{.underline} Even before COVID-19, in fact, [China's
economic vital signs were worrying. The government claimed a growth rate
of 6 percent, but Chinese insiders and academic research indicate that
the true number is considerably lower---and even that growth is inflated
by the relentless injection of capital into a less and less efficient
economy. As a result, overall debt grew eightfold between 2008 and the
end of 2020, reaching 335 percent of GDP.]{.underline} In other
countries, this combination of slumping productivity and growing debt
usually presages sharp crises that turn into lasting economic quagmires.
[Xi's Chinese dream involves catching up to the United States. In
reality, his country is slowing down.]{.underline}

Of all Bejing's problems --- demographic decline, a stifling political
climate, the stalling or reversal of economic reforms --- [dwindling
natural resources may be the most urgent.]{.underline} Nature and
geopolitics can interact in nasty ways. The historian Geoffrey Parker
has argued that changing [weather patterns drove war, revolution and
upheaval during a long global crisis]{.underline} in the 17th century.
More recently, climate change has opened new trade routes, resources and
rivalries in the Arctic. And now [China, a great power that often
appears bent on reordering the international system, is running out of
water in ways that are likely to **stoke conflict** at home and abroad.
Natural resources have always been **critical** to economic and global
power.]{.underline} In the 19th century, a small country --- the U.K.
--- raced ahead of the pack because its abundant coal reserves allowed
it to drive the Industrial Revolution. Britain was eventually surpassed
by the U.S., which exploited its huge tracts of arable land, massive oil
reserves and other resources to become an economic titan. The same goes
for China's rise. Capitalist reforms, a welcoming global trade system
and good demographics all contributed to Beijing's world-beating
economic growth from the late 1970s to the early 2000s. [The fact that
China was nearly self-sufficient in land, water and many raw materials
--- and that its cheap labor allowed it to exploit these resources
aggressively --- also helped it to become the workshop of the
world.]{.underline} [Yet China's natural abundance is a **thing of the
past**.]{.underline} As Michael Beckley and I argue in our forthcoming
book, "The Danger Zone," [Beijing has blown through many of its
resources. A decade ago, China became the world's largest importer of
agricultural goods. Its arable land has been shrinking due to
degradation and overuse. Breakneck development has also made China the
world's largest energy importer: It buys three-quarters of its oil
abroad at a time when America has become a net energy exporter. China's
water situation is **particularly grim**.]{.underline} As Gopal Reddy
notes, China possesses 20% of the world's population but only 7% of its
fresh water. [Entire regions, especially in the north, suffer from water
scarcity worse than that found in a parched Middle East. Thousands of
rivers have disappeared, while industrialization and pollution have
spoiled much of the water that remains. By some estimates, 80% to 90% of
China's groundwater and half of its river water is too dirty to drink;
more than half of its groundwater and one-quarter of its river water
cannot even be used for industry or farming. This is an **expensive
problem**. China is forced to divert water from comparatively wet
regions to the drought-plagued north; experts assess that the country
loses well over \$100 billion annually as a result of water scarcity.
Shortages and unsustainable agriculture are causing the desertification
of large chunks of land. Water-related energy shortfalls have become
common across the country.]{.underline} The government has promoted
rationing and improvements in water efficiency, but nothing sufficient
to arrest the problem. [This month, Chinese authorities announced that
Guangzhou and Shenzhen --- two major cities in the relatively water-rich
Pearl River Delta --- will face severe drought well into next year. The
economic and political implications are **troubling**. By making growth
cost more, China's resource problems have joined an array of other
challenges]{.underline} --- demographic decline, an increasingly
stifling political climate, the stalling or reversal of many key
economic reforms --- [to cause a slowdown that was having pronounced
effects even before Covid struck. China's social compact will be tested
as dwindling resources intensify distributional fights.]{.underline} In
2005, Premier Wen Jiabao stated that [water scarcity threatened the
"very survival of the Chinese nation." A minister of water resources
declared that China must "fight for every drop of water or die."
Hyperbole aside, resource scarcity and **political instability** often
go hand in hand.]{.underline}

RING OF FIRE [Eurasia has often been a deathtrap for aspiring hegemons:
there are too many nearby enemies that can make common cause with
offshore superpowers.]{.underline} For almost 40 years, a rising China
avoided strategic encirclement by downplaying its global ambitions and
maintaining friendly relations with the United States. But that period
is over. [As Beijing has become more **aggressive** in the South China
Sea, the Taiwan Strait, and elsewhere, it has engendered hostility
nearly all around. Over the past five years, the **United States** has
abandoned engagement and **embraced neo-containment**. Washington has
carried out its largest naval and missile expansion in a generation,
imposed its most aggressive tariffs since World War II, and implemented
its tightest restrictions on foreign investment since the Cold War---all
directed at China. Arms sales and military support to frontline states
have increased; U.S. technological sanctions are **threatening to
destroy** Huawei and other Chinese firms.]{.underline} In 2021, China's
deputy foreign minister complained that "a whole-of-government and
whole-of-society campaign is being waged to bring China down." [The
United States' **turn against China** has contributed to a broader
backlash against Beijing's power. In Northeast Asia, Taiwan has become
more determined than ever to maintain its de facto independence, and the
government has approved a bold new defense strategy that could make the
island extremely hard to conquer. Japan has agreed to cooperate closely
with the United States to fend off Chinese aggression in the region.
Through its own belligerence, Beijing has given the U.S.-Japanese
alliance an explicitly anti-China cast.]{.underline} The countries
around the South China Sea are also starting to hedge against China.
Vietnam is acquiring mobile shore-based missiles, Russian attack
submarines, new fighter aircraft, and surface ships armed with advanced
cruise missiles. Singapore has quietly become a significant U.S.
military partner. Indonesia increased its defense spending 20 percent in
2020 and another 21 percent in 2021. Even the Philippines, which courted
China for most of President Rodrigo Duterte's term, is now reiterating
its claims in the South China Sea and ramping up air and naval patrols.
China's ambitions are provoking a response beyond East Asia, too, from
Australia to India to Europe. Everywhere Beijing is pushing, a growing
cast of rivals is pushing back. The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue---a
strategic partnership that includes Australia, India, Japan, and the
United States---has emerged as a focal point of anti-China cooperation
among the most powerful democracies in the Indo-Pacific. The new AUKUS
(Australia--United Kingdom--United States) alliance unites the core of
the Anglosphere against Beijing. [The **United States** is forging
overlapping mini-coalitions to ensure that advanced democracies stay
ahead in key technologies, while the G-7 and NATO are staking out
tougher positions on Taiwan and other issues.]{.underline} To be sure,
counter-China cooperation remains a work in progress, because many
countries still rely on trade with Beijing. [But these interlocking
partnerships could eventually form a noose around Beijing's
neck.]{.underline} FLAMING OUT [China is a risen power, **not a rising
one**]{.underline}: it has acquired formidable geopolitical
capabilities, but its best days are behind it. That distinction matters,
because China has staked out vaulting ambitions and now may not be able
to achieve them without drastic action. [The CCP aims to **reclaim
Taiwan**, dominate the western Pacific, and **spread its influence**
around the globe. Xi has declared that China seeks a "future where we
will win the initiative and have the dominant position." Yet that dream
is starting to slip away, as growth slows and China faces an
increasingly hostile world.]{.underline}

Such costs might be acceptable in exchange for peace and security. [But
spheres of influence during the]{.underline} Cold War did not prevent
the Soviets from repeatedly testing American redlines in Berlin,
[causing high-stakes crises in which **nuclear war** was a real
possibility.]{.underline} [Nor did those spheres prevent the two sides
from competing sharply, and sometimes violently]{.underline}, throughout
the "Third World." Throughout history, [spheres-of-influence
settlements]{.underline}, from the Thirty Years' Peace between Athens
and Sparta to the Peace of Amiens between the United Kingdom and
Napoleonic France have often [ended, sooner or later, in war. The idea
that spheres of influence are a formula for peace rests on assumptions
that often go unexamined]{.underline}: that revisionist powers are
driven primarily by insecurity, that their grievances are limited and
can be easily satisfied, that the truly vital interests of competing
powers do not conflict, and that creative statecraft can therefore
fashion an enduring, mutually acceptable equilibrium. [The trouble is
that these premises don't always hold. Ideology and the quest for
greatness---not simply insecurity---often drive great
powers.]{.underline} Rising states are continually tempted to
renegotiate previous bargains once they have the power to do so.
[Offering concessions to a revisionist state may simply convince it that
the existing order is fragile and can be tested further. Conceding a
sphere of influence to a great-power challenger might not produce
stability but simply give that challenger a better position from which
to realize its ambitions.]{.underline} Consider the situation in the
western Pacific. The most minimal [Chinese sphere of influence would
surely include Taiwan. Yet if Taiwan became a platform for Chinese
military capabilities, the defense of other U.S. allies in the region,
such as Japan and the Philippines, would become vastly more
difficult]{.underline}. Nor would such a concession likely satisfy
Chinese ambitions. [A growing body of literature by scholars such as
Toshi Yoshihara, James Holmes, Liza Tobin, and Elizabeth Economy
suggests that China desires at the very least to push the United States
beyond the chain of islands running from Japan to Taiwan to the
Philippines. Even a limited Chinese sphere in the western Pacific would
serve as a springboard to this larger objective.]{.underline} Meanwhile,
the [United States will have sacrificed a]{.underline} number of
critical advantages by pulling out. A free Taiwan offers proof that
Chinese culture and democracy are not incompatible; [subjugating Taiwan
would also allow Beijing to remove this ideological threat. Worse still,
the United States would lose the edge that comes from being the only
great power without significant security hazards near its
borders.]{.underline} It was only after the [United States achieved
dominance in the Western Hemisphere that it could project power
globally. Russia and China, by contrast, still have to deal with **U.S.
allies, partners, and military presences in their own backyards**---a
circumstance that diverts resources they might otherwise use to pursue
more distant ambitions and compete with the United States at a truly
global scale.]{.underline}

## AT: China/Russia

### 2AC\-\--China/Russia\-\--T/L

#### **Expansion of US hegemonic influence in Eastern Europe is vital to deter China and Russia -- perception is key.**

**Rothman 22 --** has a M.A. in International Relations from the
University of Seton Hall, 1/24/22 (Noah, "What the Right Gets Wrong
about Ukraine, Russia, and American Hegemony", Commentary,
<https://www.commentary.org/noah-rothman/what-the-right-gets-wrong-about-ukraine-russia-and-american-hegemony/>,
accessed 6/26/22)//jd

With Russia bearing down on Ukraine and Western nations demonstrating
more willingness to deter Moscow from starting another shooting war on
the European continent, some on the American right are wondering why the
West is invested in Ukrainian security at all. Indeed, they don't see
America's commitment to deterring Russian aggression as deterrence. It
is, to them, America sleepwalking into a disastrous conflict that is
none of our business. They have gotten the stakes of this standoff and
America's interests precisely wrong. One of the primary sources of
confusion among those on the right who favor a more introverted American
foreign policy is that they have adopted Moscow's confused rationale for
its own aggression. Of this impulse, New York Times columnist Ross
Douthat's analysis is instructive. In his latest column, Douthat lays
most of the blame for the current crisis at the Kremlin's feet, but not
all of it. He writes that, in the supposedly bygone era in which the
United States was a "hyperpower," America backed the eastward expansion
of NATO that was both provocative and risky. This, he writes, was an
aspirational foreign policy, not one that accounted for "the realities
of power." Douthat adds, "the attempt to draw Ukraine out of Russia's
orbit, the partway-open door to Ukrainians who preferred
westward-focused alliances, was a foolish overcommitment even when
American power was at its height." This outlook is flawed in two ways.
First, it assigns all agency to Washington and robs America's non-allied
partners of sovereignty[. Washington didn't grab Ukraine by the hand and
guide it toward integration with the West. Ukrainians themselves have
made that desire plain, and they have demonstrated a repeated
willingness to fight for it.]{.underline} Ukraine's present conflict
with Moscow arguably began with the "Orange Revolution" of January 2005,
xwhich culminated in the ascension of Viktor Yushchenko to the
presidency. Almost immediately after that regime change, Ukraine and
NATO inaugurated an "intensified dialogue" around a Membership Action
Plan (MAP) that would one day result in Ukrainian ascension into NATO.
But the conditions NATO attached to ascension were never met and, by
2008, a NATO summit in Bucharest that agreed to Ukraine and Georgia's
ascension only in the distant and indefinite future signaled the end of
Ukraine's progress toward becoming a NATO member. At the same time, the
rise of "non-aligned" Viktor Yanukovych to serve as prime minister and,
eventually, the president seemed like a concession to the "realities of
power" in the region. But that proved a concession that Ukrainians were
unwilling to make. A second revolution in 2014 ousted the Yanukovych
regime, but the Ukrainians who fought and died fighting their own
government in Maidan weren't carrying NATO flags to the front. [They
carried the flags of both Ukraine and the European Union because the
event that catalyzed that rebellion was the Yanukovych government's
unilateral suspension of a free trade agreement with the EU, not NATO's
enlargement. Westward alignment isn't something that Ukrainians are
ambivalent about.]{.underline} As recently as December, polling
indicated that only about one-fifth of Ukrainians support joining a
customs union with Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. [They back
integration with the EU and NATO by 58 and 54 percent respectively---a
national ambition so central to Ukraine's identity it is codified in its
constitution.]{.underline} Consigning Ukraine to the Russian sphere of
influence wouldn't be the natural course of affairs if we only
extricated ourselves from Europe's complexities, and that sentiment
won't go away just because we want it to. That brings us to the second
flaw in Douthat's analysis: Ukraine's ascension into NATO was and
remains a distant prospect. It is Kyiv's desire to integrate
economically and politically with the West that Moscow views as an
imminent threat. Russia retails the notion that the present crisis is a
response to the West's heedless expansionism, but there's no reason to
lend credence to that dubious narrative. It's Ukraine's independence
that so irritates the Kremlin. Douthat proposes an "ideal retreat" from
Ukraine which would leave ["NATO expansion permanently tabled, with
Ukraine subject to inevitable Russian pressure but neither invaded nor
annexed, and with our NATO allies shouldering more of the burden of
maintaining a security perimeter in Eastern Europe.]{.underline}" He
concedes that it would be a struggle to execute an immaculate
retrenchment, as our bitter experience in Afghanistan suggests. But it
might be the "least-bad" of our available options. [This is exactly the
concession Russia is demanding from the West. How else could you
interpret Moscow's demands in exchange for ratcheting down
tensions?]{.underline} The Kremlin has insisted, in writing, that the
United States and the West must commit not just to halting NATO
expansion but must remove all troops and weapons from nations that
entered the NATO alliance after 1997; namely, the entire former Warsaw
Pact. [Thus, Russia has effectively asked the West to gift them a sphere
of influence they cannot secure militarily, diplomatically, or
economically. To do so would abrogate the sovereignty of our partners
and allies in Europe, shatter confidence in America across the globe,
and represent a profound misreading of the imbalance of forces arrayed
against Russian interests in its own backyard.]{.underline} Those who
are attracted to Douthat's argument appear to believe that the West's
only course of action short of war with Russia is retreat. There is, in
the estimation of the American Conservative editor Rod Dreher, an
"eagerness" among "American elites" to get involved in a real shooting
war with Russia. "We have no realistic choice but to cede to at least
some of Russia's demands," he writes, lest we abandon the geostrategic
imperative of containing a revisionist China. Such a theory confuses
deterrence with war-making. [The dispatching of lethal arms into
Ukraine, as well as the deployment of troops, naval assets, and area
denial technology, is designed to raise the stakes of conflict to the
point that Moscow blinks. That would be the best of all imaginable
resolutions to the present conflict, because the refugee crisis,
economic disruptions, and war of attrition in Europe that would follow a
Russian invasion would be catastrophic.]{.underline} After all, the
likelihood that U.S. could avoid becoming entangled in a conflict on
NATO's borders that involves America's ratified allies is negligible.
**[Nor is deterrence a zero-sum game]{.underline}**. Both the Chinese
and Taiwanese are watching events in Eastern Europe closely, the latter
with a sense of existential dread. In recent weeks, Taiwan has committed
to deepening its bilateral ties with post-Soviet states (in particular,
Lithuania) including the establishment of a billion-dollar fund designed
to offset Beijing's economic pressure on these and other nations to
abandon Taipei. In a 2019 report to Taiwan's parliament, the country's
National Security Bureau warned that "the Chinese Communist Party is
copying the methods used by Russia to annex Crimea against Taiwan." [The
Taiwanese would rightly view a Western capitulation to Russian demands
that acknowledges the legitimacy of a security architecture that robs
Kyiv of its right to freely join foreign military alliances as a
precursor to its own abandonment.]{.underline} Douthat is wrong insofar
as the "least-bad" resolution to the crisis in Europe would be to defuse
it without sacrificing either the post-Cold War order or Westphalian
sovereignty. And the only way to secure that outcome amid the crisis
Moscow has inaugurated would be to force it to back down---through troop
deployments, diplomatic offensives, preventative sanctions, or even the
provision of face-saving offramps like the restoration of defunct
security agreements. But back down it must. [What we cannot do is
consign Ukraine to Russian domination. Even if we could, the Ukrainians
themselves have proven they would never accept it. That is a challenge,
indeed, but it's a manageable challenge. By contrast, the wages of
appeasement would be too costly to bear.]{.underline}

What a difference two decades make. In the early years of this century,
the world appeared to be moving toward a single, seamless order under
U.S. leadership. [Today the world is fragmenting, and authoritarian
challengers, led by China and Russia, are chipping away at American
influence in East Asia, eastern Europe, and the Middle
East.]{.underline} In its 2002 National Security Strategy, the George W.
Bush administration envisioned the end of great-power rivalries. [In
2020, the question is how great powers can navigate their rivalries
without stumbling into **war**.]{.underline} Writing in Foreign Affairs
("The New Spheres of Influence," March/April 2020), Graham Allison
offers a road map for this new environment: the United States should
accept the return of "spheres of influence" and effectively let China
and Russia dominate swaths of their respective geopolitical
neighborhoods. Doing so, Allison contends, is actually in keeping with
the United States' best diplomatic traditions, considering that
Washington tolerated a Soviet sphere of influence in eastern Europe
during the Cold War. Reviving that tradition is necessary, simply
because the United States no longer has the military and economic
dominance to deny China and Russia their geopolitical due. And it is
desirable, because mutually accepted spheres of influence can promote
stability and peace in a more rivalrous world. [Allison's argument is
alluring but wrong]{.underline}. In truth, the United States has
resisted the creation of rival spheres of influence for most of its
history, even as it has worked assiduously to build its own. [Ceding
ground to China and Russia today would be not a recipe for stability but
a blueprint for **coercion and conflict**, and it would weaken the
United States' geopolitical hand vis-à-vis its rivals.]{.underline} Nor
is a return to spheres of influence foreordained---[Washington still has
the **power** to prevent Beijing and Moscow from dominating their
regions]{.underline}, so long as it rejects Allison's advice to cut
loose its vulnerable frontline allies. A tougher, more competitive world
is unavoidable. A far more dangerous world, divided into competing
superpower fiefdoms, is not. AN AMERICAN TRADITION Spheres of influence
have been common throughout history, but Americans have never been quite
comfortable with them. In fact, much of [U.S. foreign
policy]{.underline} dating back to independence has [consisted of
efforts to prevent rival powers from establishing such
domains.]{.underline} In the nineteenth century, U.S. leaders rejected
the idea that any European power should have a sphere of influence in
North America or the Western Hemisphere at large. They
maneuvered---often quite ruthlessly---to evict European powers from
these areas. At the turn of the twentieth century, the United States
took this regional policy global. The so-called Open Door policy aimed
to dissuade foreign powers from carving up China, and later all of East
Asia, into exclusive spheres. Washington joined World War I in part to
prevent Germany from becoming the dominant European power. [A generation
later, the United States fought to deny Japan a sphere of influence in
the Pacific and prevent Hitler from establishing primacy over the entire
Old World.]{.underline} During and after World War II, Washington also
engaged in quieter diplomatic and economic efforts to accelerate the
dissolution of the British Empire. Even during the Cold War, Americans
never fully accepted Soviet control over eastern Europe. The Truman and
Eisenhower administrations sought to roll back the Iron Curtain through
ideological warfare and covert action; later administrations expanded
trade and diplomatic ties with Warsaw Pact states as a subtler way of
undermining Kremlin control. The Reagan administration overtly and
covertly supported political movements that were challenging the
Kremlin's authority from within. [And when Washington had a chance to
peacefully destroy the Soviet sphere of influence after the fall of the
Berlin Wall, it did, supporting German unification and the expansion of
NATO.]{.underline} [Opposition to spheres of influence, in other words,
is a part of U.S. diplomatic DNA]{.underline}. The reason for this,
Charles Edel and I argued in 2018, [is that spheres of influence clash
with fundamental tenets of U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}. Among them
is the [United States' approach to security, which holds that
safeguarding the country's vital interests and physical well-being
requires preventing rival powers from establishing a foothold in the
Western Hemisphere or dominating strategically important regions
overseas]{.underline}. [Likewise, the United States' emphasis on
promoting liberty and free trade translates to a concern that spheres of
influence---particularly those dominated by authoritarian powers---would
impede the spread of U.S. values and allow hostile powers to block
American trade and investment]{.underline}. [Finally, spheres of
influence do not mesh well with American exceptionalism---the notion
that the United States should transcend the old, corrupt ways of
balance-of-power diplomacy and establish a more humane, democratic
system of international relations.]{.underline} Of course, that
intellectual tradition did not stop the United States from building its
own sphere of influence in Latin America from the early nineteenth
century onward, nor did it prevent it from drawing large chunks of
Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East into a global sphere of influence
after World War II. Yet the same tradition has led the United States to
run its sphere of influence far more progressively than past great
powers, which is why far more countries have sought to join that sphere
than to leave it. And since hypocrisy is another venerable tradition in
global affairs, it is not surprising that Americans would establish
their own, relatively enlightened sphere of influence while denying the
legitimacy of everyone else's. That endeavor reached its zenith in the
post--Cold War era, when the collapse of the Soviet bloc made it
possible to envision a world in which [Washington's sphere of
influence---also known as the liberal international order---was the only
game in town]{.underline}. [The United States maintained a
**world-beating military** that could intervene around the globe;
preserved and expanded a global alliance structure as a check on
aggression; and sought to integrate potential challengers, namely
Beijing and Moscow, into a U.S.-led system.]{.underline} It was a
remarkably ambitious project, as Allison rightly notes, but it was the
culmination of, rather than a departure from, a diplomatic tradition
reaching back two centuries.

GIVE THEM AN INCH... The post--Cold War moment is over, and the prospect
of a divided world has returned. [Russia is projecting power in the
Middle East and staking a claim to dominance in its "near abroad." China
is seeking primacy in the western Pacific and Southeast Asia and using
its diplomatic and economic influence to draw countries around the world
more tightly into its orbit.]{.underline} Both have developed the tools
needed to coerce their neighbors and keep U.S. forces at bay. Allison is
one of several analysts who have recently advanced the argument that the
United States should make a virtue of necessity---that it should accept
Russian and Chinese spheres of influence, encompassing some portion of
eastern Europe and the western Pacific, as the price of stability and
peace. The logic is twofold: first, to create a cleaner separation
between contending parties by clearly marking where one's influence ends
and the other's begins; and second, to reduce the chances of conflict by
giving rising or resurgent powers a safe zone along their borders. In
theory, this seems like a reasonable way of preventing competition from
turning into outright conflict, especially given that countries such as
Taiwan and the Baltic states lie thousands of miles from the United
States but on the doorsteps of its rivals. Yet in reality, [a
spheres-of-influence world would bring more peril than
safety.]{.underline} [Russia's and China's spheres of influence would
inevitably be domains of coercion and **authoritarianism**. Both
countries are run by illiberal, autocratic regimes; their leaders see
democratic values as profoundly threatening to their political survival.
If Moscow and Beijing dominated their respective neighborhoods, they
would naturally seek to undermine democratic governments that resist
their control---as China is already doing in **Taiwan** and as Russia is
doing in Ukraine---or that challenge, through their very existence, the
legitimacy of authoritarian rule. The practical consequence of acceding
to authoritarian spheres of influence would be to intensify the crisis
of democracy that afflicts the world today. The United States would
**suffer economically**, too. China, in particular, is a mercantilist
power already working to turn Asian economies toward Beijing and could
one day put the United States at a severe disadvantage on the world's
most economically dynamic continent.]{.underline} Washington should not
concede a Chinese sphere of influence unless it is also willing to
compromise the "Open Door" principles that have animated its statecraft
for over a century.

[It sounds too good to be true, and indeed, it is. Once the historically
dubious claims and flawed strategic assumptions are corrected, the case
for offshore balancing **collapses**]{.underline}. [The concept may
remain popular in certain academic circles, but it is no wonder senior
policymakers have consistently rejected it in practice.]{.underline}
REWRITING HISTORY Offshore balancers argue that their strategy
represents the United States' traditional approach to global affairs,
and one that has consistently proved effective in advancing U.S.
interests. [In reality, however, U.S. policymakers have pursued offshore
balancing only when they have been overly focused on avoiding short-term
costs, such as those associated with overseas military deployments, and
have thus been willing to accept a high level of strategic risk. The
results have been]{.underline} ambiguous at best and [**disastrous** at
worst, which is why the strategy has so often been discarded in favor of
a more engaged approach. In the 1920s and 1930s]{.underline}, for
instance, [the United States pursued a version of offshore
balancing]{.underline}, by relying on regional governments to uphold
power balances in Europe and East Asia. [Those efforts failed, forcing
the United States to enter World War II and launch major campaigns in
both theaters. After sacrificing more than 400,000 American lives and
spending the equivalent of \$4.1 trillion today in the process, the
United States rightly discarded offshore balancing as too costly and
risky a way of defending its interests in those regions]{.underline}.
[Instead, U.S. policymakers committed the country to an **onshore
military** presence that continues seven decades later, as well as to an
ultimately successful effort to shape the internal politics and security
dynamics of those areas]{.underline}. [The United States' next foray
into offshore balancing, in Cold War Korea, ended no more successfully.
In 1950, North Korean troops---responding in part to the U.S. withdrawal
from South Korea the previous year---overran nearly the entire
peninsula. U.S. forces then intervened, and, after some 36,000 U.S.
soldiers were killed and the equivalent of \$320 billion today was
spent, the United States once again shifted to an onshore strategy,
which has helped prevent a recurrence of the Korean War to this
day.]{.underline} The United States' longest reliance on offshore
balancing has come in the Middle East---from 1945 until 1990 and again
from 2011 to 2014. The United States did make brief onshore
interventions (notably, in Lebanon in 1958 and again in 1982--84 and in
Libya in 2011), but it primarily used economic aid, diplomatic support,
covert intervention, and arms transfers to get major powers such as
Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, and Saudi Arabia to defend a favorable
balance of power. Even after the Iranian Revolution knocked out a key
U.S. partner, [the United States stuck with offshore balancing,
supporting Saddam Hussein as the price of maintaining an acceptable
balance of power in the Gulf, while also developing the over-the-horizon
military capabilities needed to intervene in an emergency. It ended up
having to do just that in 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait and threatened
to overrun crucial Saudi oil fields, thereby threatening the regional
balance and bringing yet another experiment in offshore balancing to a
bloody conclusion.]{.underline} The subsequent discovery of an
unexpectedly advanced weapons-of-mass-destruction program in Iraq, along
with concerns over the weak Gulf states' ability to balance against
Baghdad on their own, convinced U.S. leaders to shift to an onshore
strategy, which President George W. Bush doubled down on after the 9/11
attacks by invading Iraq. President Barack Obama's decision to withdraw
from the country at the end of 2011 marked a shift back to offshore
balancing in the Middle East, with the exception of Afghanistan, on the
periphery of the region. But the rapid advance of the Islamic State
(also known as ISIS) in 2014 convinced Obama to commit nearly 5,000 U.S.
ground troops to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria, along with thousands more
operating from air bases and ships in the region. In short, [when
leaders have tried offshore balancing, the strategy has tended to fail
in costly ways, convincing them to shift to a more forward-leaning
approach]{.underline}. Thus, Mearsheimer and Walt's sunny claim that
"for nearly a century, . . . offshore balancing prevented the emergence
of dangerous regional hegemons and preserved a global balance of power
that enhanced American security" masks a much darker reality: [offshore
balancing has succeeded only if one considers **World War II**, **the
Korean War**, **the Persian Gulf War**, and the rise of **ISIS** an
acceptable price for remaining offshore. If this is success, one
shudders to imagine what failure might look like.]{.underline} FUZZY
MATH [Offshore balancing's costs are not limited to the wars that must
be fought when regional balances collapse.]{.underline} There are also
the costs of maintaining those balances even when the strategy appears
to be working. O[ffshore balancing requires the United States to become
more dependent on morally bankrupt regimes, subordinating all else to
the narrow realpolitik requirement of short-term stability. In the
Middle East alone, offshore balancing tied the United States to its
partnership with the ill-fated shah of Iran during the 1970s and caused
it to turn a blind eye to Saddam's domestic **terror**, **international
aggression**, and widespread use of **chemical weapons** during the
1980s. In both cases, the consequences for **human rights**, as well as
for longer-term regional stability, were problematic, to say the
least.]{.underline} To make matters worse, [offshore balancing
encourages **nuclear proliferation**]{.underline}. Throughout the
postwar era, maintaining an onshore presence has given the United States
leverage to restrain allies' nuclear ambitions while also mitigating the
insecurity that might otherwise have driven such countries as Germany,
Japan, and South Korea to pursue the bomb. [Withdrawing offshore
threatens to have the opposite effect. It is no surprise that South
Korea expressed nuclear aspirations when the United States gestured at
withdrawing its troops from the peninsula during the 1970s, or that
Taiwan did likewise when U.S. rapprochement with China appeared to
jeopardize the United States' commitment to the island's security.
Offshore balancers may wave away the dangers of proliferation; given the
destructive power of nuclear weapons, policymakers can hardly be so
cavalier.]{.underline}

## AT: Econ Decline

### 2AC\-\--Heg Prevents Econ Decline

#### Hegemony is necessary to prevent economic decline

**Norrlof 17** \[17 July 2017, Norrlof, Carla, Carla Norrlöf is
Professor of Political Science at the University of Toronto, a Senior
Fellow of Massey College and a non-resident Senior Fellow with the
Atlantic Council. Her research is on theories of international
cooperation with a special focus on great powers particularly US
hegemony in the areas of money, trade and security., "Hegemony,
Hierarchy, and Unipolarity: Theoretical and Empirical Foundations of
Hegemonic Order Studies", Oxford University Press\]//AA

Rationale for the Hegemonic Order Several international relations
theories of dominance have emerged: the public goods version of
hegemonic stability theory, the security version of hegemonic stability
theory, the dyadic-hierarchy model, and unipolarity. All of these
perspectives agree that it is worthwhile to study a concentration of
power across different dimensions. Public Goods Version of Hegemonic
Stability Theory (Kindleberger) Kindleberger proposed that **[a dominant
power]{.underline}** was **[necessary for stable, harmonious economic
relations]{.underline}** (Kindleberger, 1973, 1981). He explained
**[international economic cooperation]{.underline}** as **[a public
goods problem, from which everyone could benefit but no one could be
excluded]{.underline}** (Frohlich & Oppenheimer, 1970). Since
beneficiaries can enjoy public goods irrespective of their
contributions, by free-riding, large groups encounter difficulties
providing public goods (Olson, 1965). [If everyone fails to contribute,
the public good will not be fully provided.]{.underline} However, a
single actor with sufficient interest in bearing the full costs of
public good provision can solve the problem (Olson, 1965; Olson &
Zeckhauser, 1966). In Olson's (1965) famous assertion, ["The small
exploit the large."]{.underline} From the theory outlining the
difficulty of collective action, Kindleberger derived his proposition
that, **[for "the world economy to be stabilized, there has to be a
stabilizer---one stabilizer"]{.underline}** (1973, p. 304). For
Kindleberger, global economic stabilization meant ["some country . . .
would undertake to provide a market for distress goods, a steady if not
countercyclical flow of capital, and a rediscount mechanism for
providing liquidity when the monetary system is frozen in
panic"]{.underline} (Kindleberger, 1981, p. 247). He also added
exchange-rate stabilization and coordination of monetary policies. In
the late 1980s, Webb and Krasner (1989, p. 196) invited scholars to
validate Kindleberger's argument, which they said "might not have been
truly tested . . . [The real test of hegemonic leadership arises in
times of crises."]{.underline} Two decades passed before scholars met
this call. The 2008 financial crisis brought renewed interest in the
question of whether the United States, as the world's dominant power,
performed crucial stabilization functions during the crisis. Scholars
were invited to reorient around real problems to explain the emergence
and maintenance of global financial orders (Drezner & McNamara, 2013).
Drezner (2014, p. 153, p. 156) drew on some of Kindleberger's criteria
to examine whether the United States and multilateral institutions
helped stabilize the world economy and found that both played a role.
Cohen (2015a) used Kindleberger's five functions to explore whether
China's rise as a monetary power could be successfully accommodated, and
concluded that accommodation is possible. However, his investigation did
not settle whether and how stabilization occurred during the crisis.
Norrlof and Reich (2015) examined Kindleberger's five functions and
asked whether the world economy requires one stabilizer or if these
functions were shared between the United States and China. They found
limited support for the first proposition, with stronger support for
shared stabilization, during the global financial crisis. As more
Chinese data become available, alternative methods should be used to
determine the robustness of these findings and the validity of
Kindleberger's version of hegemonic stability theory. McDowell (2012)
provided a detailed case study of the capabilities and incentives that
resulted in the United States acting as an international lender of last
resort during the global financial crisis, arguing that the Federal
Reserve's swap program is an example of U.S. structural power as
conceived by Strange (1988b). Norrlof (2014) provided empirical
snapshots of the dollar's sustained preeminence despite deficits, wars,
and the global financial crisis, and theorized how U.S. monetary
capabilities translate into currency influence using power analysis.
Cohen also explained the dollar's supremacy after the financial crisis
through a power lens, seeing autonomy as especially important for
understanding the dollar's global role (Cohen, 2015b). Helleiner (2014)
described the continuity in the global financial order since the 2008
crisis, concurring with McDowell (2012) that Federal Reserve swap lines
reflect U.S. structural power, and that the dollar's reserve role has
remained largely unchanged but Helleiner's metrics are flawed. Security
Version of Hegemonic Stability Theory (Gilpin & Krasner) More than any
other scholar, Gilpin (1975, 1977, 1981) was the progenitor of hegemonic
stability theory: ["Just as the Pax Britannica provided the security and
political organization for the expansion of transnational economic
activity in the nineteenth century, so the Pax Americana has fulfilled a
similar function in the mid-twentieth century"]{.underline} (Gilpin,
1975, p. 111). Krasner's (1976) work was seminal in providing
theoretical justification for why, and under what conditions, a
hegemonic power supported free trade. Gilpin went beyond claims relating
dominance to economic openness, arguing that the **["Pax Britannica and
Pax Americana, like the Pax Romana, ensured an international system of
relative peace and security"]{.underline}** (Gilpin, 1981, pp.
144--145). Reflecting on his contribution, Gilpin observed, "Stephen
Krasner and I each appropriated Kindleberger's basic idea that a
political leader was needed to create and manage an international
liberal economy. However, each of us made several modifications that
placed Kindleberger's insight within a state-centric intellectual
framework of political analysis and thus fashioned a state-centric
version of the theory of hegemonic stability" (Gilpin, 2001, p. 99). In
this version of hegemonic stability theory, [the hegemon provides an
open economy as long as the distribution of gains does not compromise
its security.]{.underline} As Webb and Krasner (1989, p. 184) explained,
". . . **[the dominant state can promote liberalization without
jeopardizing essential security objectives.]{.underline}** This is
because an open system increases the income, the growth, and the
political power of the hegemonic state without seriously affecting its
social stability, and because the hegemonic state has symbolic,
economic, and military capabilities that can be used to entice or compel
others to accept an open trading structure . . . If the pattern of
relative gains threatens the security of powerful states, international
economic liberalization will be restricted even though those states
could have increased their absolute welfare by participating in a more
open system." Thus, the [hegemonic power will only support openness as
long as other states do not gain more than the hegemon from
international economic exchange.]{.underline} If the distribution of
gains were to shift toward other states, economic gains could be
transferred to the security arena, undermining the hegemon's dominance.
These contributions have had tremendous impact and still resonate four
decades later. The central claim embodied in Gilpin and Krasner's
version of **[hegemonic stability]{.underline}** is that an economically
open and peaceful international system is more likely to emerge when a
hegemon is rising and **[has the capability and interest to foster open,
peaceful interstate relations]{.underline}** (Krasner, 1976, p. 323;
Gilpin, 1981). **[Dominance breeds stability because only a dominant
power has the incentive to single-handedly provide public goods from
which everyone benefits.]{.underline}**

Just as these other power factors influence a country's ability to
develop military power, a country's military power also plays a key role
in its development of these other factors of power.

Economic: A state that can protect its territory, resources and trade
routes has a major economic advantage over others that are unable to do
so. Furthermore, [military power can be a catalyst for economic
growth,]{.underline} if applied properly.

Demographic: A state with a relatively high degree of military power has
the capability to protect its population and to allow for its population
to grow at a healthy pace.

Environmental and Natural Resources: A strong military allows a country
to protect its environmental and resource wealth, while giving it the
option to seize the environmental and resource wealth of its weaker
rivals.

Political: For better or worse, armed forces have played a major role in
determining the level of political stability in states throughout
history. When political-military relations are strong and stable, a
country is able to achieve a higher degree of political power.

Technology: The armed forces have been the catalyst and the source for
many of the major technological achievements reached throughout human
history and are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.

Cultural: Military power plays a lesser role in determining a country's
level of cultural power, although states with dominant military
positions are often able to force their cultural norms on weaker states.

[Many states throughout history have used their advantages in terms of
military power to achieve great power status]{.underline}. For example,
Macedonia under Philip II and Alexander was considered a backwater by
other Greek powers, but its military advantages allowed it to become the
most powerful of all of the ancient Greek states. Prussia too was
considered a backwater by other European and German states, but its
development of a strong military allowed it to unify Germany and emerge
as continental Europe's most powerful state. [The Soviet Union's great
power status was also based upon a foundation of military power,
something that it allowed it to emerge as a global
superpower]{.underline} in the wake of the Second World War.

//KS}

The essential fact is that the [United States sits at the pinnacle of a
world order th]{.underline}at it played a central role in designing, and
[which benefits no other country so much as it does]{.underline} --- you
might have guessed --- [America itself.]{.underline}

America [runs a world orde]{.underline}r that might have some collateral
benefits for other countries, but is largely [built around US
interests:]{.underline} to [enrich America and American
business;]{.underline} to keep Americans safe while creating jobs and
profits for America's military-industrial complex; [and to make sure
that America retains, as long as possible, its position as the richest,
dominant global superpower]{.underline}. Rather than global cop, it's
more accurate to call America the world's majority shareholder,
investing its resources in global stability less out of charity than
self-interest.

What this means is that as Trump develops his foreign policy --- a
dealmaking approach whose ultimate outlines we can only guess at --- he
will eventually have to walk back his promise or confront its real
costs. It\'s easy to paint America as the rich uncle whom the world
takes advantage of. That caricature certainly resonates with Trump's
voting base. But if Trump really tries to deliver on his promise and
walk away from the world, the biggest price is likely to be borne by
America itself.

The United States and its allies, in the wake of World War II, built a
web of institutions that had an ideological goal: to reduce the risk of
another murderous global conflagration. The United Nations would serve
as a political-diplomatic talk shop that would reduce the chance of
accidental superpower war and create avenues for managing the conflicts
that did break out. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
were designed to minimize the risk of another Great Depression. An
acronym soup of other institutions sprang up along the same lines. When
memories of fascism were fresh and Washington feared the allure of
communism, it made some far-sighted, pragmatic moves. [It funded the
Marshall Plan for Europe, paying so the continent could recover
economically and emerge to become a pivotal U.S. ally\--and a profitable
market for US companies]{.underline}. U.S. military occupiers in Japan
and South Korea decreed progressive reforms and land redistributions in
order to outflank communists.

In some cases, [America really has underwritten most of the funding for
international institutions,]{.underline} whether their purpose is to
monitor ancient ruins (UNESCO) or inspect nuclear sites (IAEA). It
hasn't done so out of altruism. The [investment has paid itself back
many times over.]{.underline} These institutions have worked
imperfectly, but they build goodwill and reduce risk. That's good for
the world in general, but it's great for America.

It\'s true that America\'s role is expensive. In 2015, America spent
more than the next seven nations combined on defense. Worried about this
gap in the years after 9/11, some American officials and neoconservative
ideologues complained that "Old Europe" should pay more for its defense.
Like Trump, they argued that Europe has been able to reap an economic
windfall because America shoulders so much of the NATO security
umbrella.

At best, this analysis is a dangerous exaggeration; Europe could and
probably should shoulder more of the cost, [but the US investment in
NATO is worthwhile for its own sake]{.underline}. At worst, [by
threatening NATO, the "free-rider" trope sets up America to shoot itself
in the foot -- shaking its security and breaking up a system with huge
direct benefits to Americans.]{.underline}

Rather than a nation rooked by crafty foreigners, it makes more sense to
see America at the center of a web of productive investments. Here's how
it works:

First, most of [America's defense]{.underline} spending [functions as a
massive, job creating subsidy]{.underline} for the U.S. defense
industry. According to a Deloitte study, the aerospace and defense
sector directly employed 1.2 million workers in 2014, and another [3.2
million indirectly]{.underline}. Obama\'s 2017 budget calls for \$619
billion in [defense spending,]{.underline} which [is a direct giveback
to the American economy,]{.underline} and only \$50 billion in foreign
aid -- and even that often ends up in American pockets through grants
that benefit American farmers, aid organizations, and other US interest
groups. The U.S. military, and the Veterans Administration, are an
almost socialist paradise of equality, job security and full health care
when compared to life for Americans not on the payroll of the Defense
Department and its generously (even absurdly) remunerated contractors.
The defense budget, by [playing on America's obsession with security
rather than social welfare]{.underline}, [allows Washington to pump a
massive stimulus into the economy]{.underline} every year without
triggering another Tea Party.

Second, America's steering role in numerous regions \-- NATO, Latin
America, and the Arabian peninsula \-- gives it leverage to call the
shots on matters of great important to American security and the bottom
line. For all the friction with Saudi Arabia, for instance, the Gulf
monarchy has propped up the American economy with massive Treasury bill
purchases, and by adjusting oil production at America's request to
cushion the effect of policy priorities like the U.S. invasion of Iraq
in 2003.

Third, and most importantly, if you listen the biggest critics of the
new world order, what you\'ll hear is that it's rigged -- in America's
favor. [America's "global cop" role means that shipping lanes, free
trade agreements, oil exploration deals, ad hoc military coalitions, and
so on are maintained to the benefit of the U.S. government or U.S.
corporations]{.underline}. The truth is that America puts its thumb on
the scale to tilt the world's not-entirely free markets to America's
benefit. Nobody would be more thrilled for America to pull back than its
economic rivals, like China.

Perhaps that's why analysts in the business of predicting world affairs
don't think Trump is going to abandon America's "world policeman"
portfolio once he looks at the bottom line.

"Trump wants to be seen as projecting strength around the world and
intends to expand spending on U.S. defense," wrote Eurasia group's Ian
Bremmer shortly after the election. He might be more abrasive, and he
might pressure some of America's bottom-tier allies. But if he wants to
be a strongman, he'll have to keep America's stick.

Obama, too, apparently thinks Trump will like being the world's
policeman even more than he'll like being Putin's friend. \"[There is no
weakening of resolve when it comes to **America\'s commitment to**
**maintaining a strong and robust NATO** relationship and a recognition
that those alliances aren\'t just good for Europe, they\'re good for the
United States. And they\'re **vital for the world**]{.underline}**,**\"
outgoing President Obama said on his valedictory trip to Europe,
claiming confidence that Trump shared that view of global alliances.

Within Trumpworld, there's no question a real rift exists on this
question. Isolationist-nationalist America-firsters, like Steve Bannon,
really do want to see America pull back, and downplay the costs in the
interests of their ideological goals. Profit-driven internationalists
like Rex Tillerson, however, are intimately acquainted with the benefits
of keeping an American hand in global affairs.

Kindleberger belongs to the Liberal tradition and his arguments about
the stability of the hegemonic systems are based on the game theory. He
argues that international economic stability is a collective good to the
benefit of all states. Small and medium states know that their
individual contributions won't be enough to provide public goods.
Therefore, they are not expected to contribute to the provision of
public goods. Rather, they tend to free ride and pursue their individual
interests. As a result, the [public goods of stability and free trade
won't be available in an international system composed of only small and
medium-sized countries. **Only a hegemon possesses enough power** and
motivation to provide these public goods]{.underline} (Webb and Krasner,
1989: 184). Therefore, for Kindleberger, one hegemon required **[for a
stable world economy]{.underline}** (Kindleberger, 1981: 247).

Krasner is another important scholar in the HST. Coming from the Realist
tradition, he argues that the interests and capabilities of states with
the aim of maximizing national interest set the structure of the
international trade (Krasner, 1976: 317). He emphasizes that empirical
data largely substantiate the argument that is there is a **[hegemonic
distribution of economic power]{.underline}** in the international
system, this **[brings about an open trading system]{.underline}**
(Krasner, 1976: 318)

the only victor that was not completely devastated. World War II had
brought the country out of the Great Depression, and the US GDP
constituted more than 50 percent of the world's total. Into the
twenty-first century, the members of the Group of Seven (G7) were the
world's political and economic heavyweights. It has only been in the
past several years that the collective GDP of the developing world---led
by China---has surpassed the developed world's. Even as non-Western
powers grow, it is psychologically hard for the West to think about
relinquishing its reins.

Demographically, the West has, for a long time, been in the minority.
What's more recent is the aging of the Western population (analyzed in
chapter 2), which is already occurring in Japan and Europe, beginning to
squeeze the availability of resources for anything but health, social
security, and interest payments on debt. Unless healthcare becomes far
more efficient, the US economy will be overburdened with healthcare and
pension costs as the "baby boomer" generation ages. Healthcare
constitutes a whopping 18 percent of the US GDP---significantly more
than is the case for other industrialized countries---without
necessarily providing better results.

Biggest Problem Is Domestic

The biggest psychological blow to ordinary Western citizens has been
their sagging standard of living (more analysis in chapter 1). Despite a
much better record of overall growth in the United States since the 2008
financial crisis, those with median incomes have taken a hit.

Worrisome for future US growth potential has been the drop in the
labor-participation rate, from the 67 percent range before the 2008
financial crisis to 62-63 percent in the years since. The
labor-participation rate was destined to drop due to a growing numbers
of retirees, but much of the current sharp decrease comes from unskilled
males in their prime working years---forties and early
fifties---dropping out. Additionally, many younger women are not
entering or staying in the job market. Global Trends 2030 looked at two
scenarios for future US growth---one in which the United States
maintained or slightly increased its average 2.5 percent pre-2008 growth
rate, or one in which growth would slow to an average of 1.5 percent a
year. In the first, there would still be the global economic shift to
China. On the other hand, the 2.5 percent average growth would help
boost average living standards, engendering a "feel-good" factor, which
would make more Americans interested in reengaging with world issues.91

Given the record of slower growth and labor-force decline since the 2008
financial crisis, the likelihood of the second scenario is increasing.
That scenario anticipated [[lower growth]{.mark}
rates]{.underline}---which accelerated declines in average living
standards---**[[mak]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing [it [harder]{.mark} to
continue **trade-[liberalization]{.mark} efforts**]{.underline}. Indeed,
the IMF warned in June 2016 that the United States faces potentially
significant longer-term challenges to strong and sustained growth,
saying, "concerted policy actions are warranted, sooner rather than
later... focusing on the causes and consequences of falling labor force
participation, an increasingly polarized income distribution, high
levels of poverty, and weak productivity."92

Moreover, it is not as if traditional US partners---Europe and
Japan---are doing much better. Japan and many European countries are
aging faster than the United States, eliminating labor-force growth as a
driver of future economic growth. Europe's and Japan's economic
performances have been declining since the 1990s.

In Europe, the public discontent with high unemployment and declining
incomes has helped to spur the rise of antiestablishment far-right and
populist parties that want to weaken the EU and transatlantic ties. Even
in richer European countries, such as Germany, a backlash has been
growing against the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership
(TTIP), out of fear that Europe's rewards would be meager and European
standards would be diluted. McKinsey Global Institute, for example,
believes a "return to sustained growth of 2-to-3 percent" is possible
for Europe, but would require many politically difficult reforms.93
These include: reducing dependence on imports (much coming from Russia)
for crude oil and natural gas; fostering a more vibrant digital economy;
increasing workforce participation by the elderly, women, and migrants;
and promoting flexibility in labor markets. China now spends a greater
share of its GDP on research and development than does Europe. The
latest OECD figures show that Europe now spends even less than the rest
of the OECD.94

In both the United States and Europe, there is increasing anti-immigrant
sentiment despite documented economic benefits from immigration.
According to EU Commission Employment Analyst Dr. Jorg Peschner,
productivity, by itself, will not be enough to reverse the negative
employment trend absent more immigration: "EU's productivity growth
would have to double in order to keep the EU's economy growing at the
same pace as it did before the crisis started." For employment growth to
remain positive as long as possible, improving the labor participation
of women, low-educated people, and migrants will also have to be a
priority. In the United States, many of the new businesses started every
year are started by first- or second-generation immigrants.95

Politically, there has been a large rise in support for right-wing and
populist parties in the United States and Europe, undermining
traditional parties. The gaps, for example, between the leadership and
supporters in the US Republican and UK Tory and Labor Parties have been
particularly evident in the selection of Donald Trump as presidential
candidate and the June 2016 victory of the "Leave" vote in Britain.
Unfortunately, there is no end of economic disruption. The job churn
will continue as more and more skills and professions are automated,
also increasing the potential for more "losers" from globalization,
greater political polarization, and inequality. The increased
competitiveness of the developing world with the West is a particular
morale buster for Western middle classes who got used to ever-increasing
prosperity for themselves and succeeding generations. Adapting to a new
norm of economic turbulence---more prevalent in other eras---may be one
of the biggest mental hurdles for Westerners. The West is used to
thinking of the "Third World," not home, as the place where economic
turmoil happens.

And a Multipolar Financial Architecture, Too

Historically, **[US and Western power]{.underline}** has [rested
on]{.underline} having a monopoly on reserve currencies and **[a
Western-dominated financial system]{.underline}**. In 2035, the dollar
will be the biggest reserve currency, but its share of global financial
transactions is expected to drop from 60 percent today to 45 percent.
The euro will probably remain the second reserve currency, while the
Chinese yuan or RMB---which became a part of the IMF benchmark-currency
basket in 2015---will become a third reserve currency, accounting for 10
to 15 percent of global finance in two decades' time.96

The financial architecture will also become more regionalized. The
central role played by the financial centers of New York and London will
also diminish, and a multitiered financial architecture will develop.
Following the UK Brexit, those centers' share in financial
intermediation will decrease, as a second pole of global finance forms
in the Eurozone. A third pole will develop in East Asia and Southeast
Asia.

Gradually, a growing share of global financial resources will be
concentrated in those regional clusters. As with the growth of regional
trade, the regional clusters will be more self-encapsulated, spurred by
rising domestic demand in China and other developing countries with
growing middle classes. With the role of electronic money likely to
grow, the traditional banking system will probably also undergo major
revision, with potential impacts on governmental powers.

A more multipolar reserve system and regionalized financial architecture
should lessen risks and contribute to greater stability. But the
large-scale technological innovations---some of which contributed to the
2008 breakdown---will continue, making global finance still volatile.
Emerging-market countries with fragmentary regulatory regimes will be
particularly prone to suffering financial crises. The aging-population
factor also increases risks to public finances. This report anticipates
modestly increased volatility, lower than what occurred in the global
economy during the 1890s through the 1940s, but higher than in the 1950s
and 1960s---more of a continuation of what has been the trend line since
the mid-1980s.

Are There Alternative Visions to Western Order?

Four years ago, when Global Trends 2030 was published, the answer was
largely no.97 Increasingly, the facts on the ground would suggest
otherwise. They do not add up to a cohesive plan to substitute wholesale
all Western institutions and practices. However, they clearly indicate
that there are some no-go areas, particularly those connected to regime
change, democracy promotion, state control over NGOs, and maintaining
sovereignty. Russia and China, in particular, see themselves as great
powers and, as such, believe they have special rights to dominance in
their regions. However, as other powers like India develop, it is likely
that they will see themselves as regional powers with inherent
prerogatives. It is worth recalling the United States' expansive
Manifest Destiny and nineteenth-century Monroe Doctrine, claiming
special rights to determine the future of the Western Hemisphere.

The Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS) has been closely
following Beijing's efforts to build a network of parallel structures to
existing international organizations. It has concluded that China "is
not seeking to demolish or exit from current international
organizations...It is constructing supplementary--- in part
complementary, in part competitive---channels for shaping the
international order beyond Western claims to leadership."98

As the accompanying chart indicates, China's shadow network of
alternative international structures encompasses everything from
financial and economic partnerships (the Silk Road Economic Belt and the
Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank) to full-blown political groupings
like the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Conference on Interaction
and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA), and the BRICS
association of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.99

Moreover, there is increasing cooperation among many of the emerging
powers---beyond just authoritarians---to not just limit what they see as
Western meddling in domestic affairs, but to go on the attack globally.
According to a recent academic study, the "Big Five" authoritarian
states of China, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela "have taken
more coordinated and decisive action to contain democracy on the global
level." They have sought to "alter the democracy and human-rights
mechanisms of key rulesbased institutions, including the Organization of
American States, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, and international bodies concerned with the
governance of the Internet."100

How durable are these preferences for nondemocracy and state control? By
2035, if not sooner (in the case of Venezuela), some of the
now-authoritarian states could be liberalized, and the perceived threat
posed by Western civil-society NGOs may ease. However, China and Russia
are more likely than not to want to dominate their regions. Nationalism
and democracy have been shown to be highly compatible. It is not clear
that an even more powerful China or India would defer to Western
leadership of the global order, even if both sides' values in other
areas begin to converge.

What Kind of Post-Western World? Clearly, there is a need to [[plan for
a world that will not have the West as **its**]{.mark} **big economic
[powerhouse]{.mark}**]{.underline}---a prospect hard for Western elites
and publics to conceive of, despite a decade or more of publicity about
the "rise of the rest." According to a recent survey, Europeans and
Americans are more comfortable with each other than they are with
anybody else. Although a majority of Europeans said, in the most recent
German Marshall Fund transatlantic-trends polling, that they would like
to see their country take an approach more independent from the United
States, both Americans and Europeans still prefer each other over more
Russian or Chinese leadership in the world.

The Obama administration---considered among the most multilateralist of
recent administrations--- campaigned hard in 2015 to convince Europeans
not to join China's proposed Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank
(AIIB). It was as if the United States was against any governance
structure not "made in the USA," even when those running the AIIB have
made clear their intentions of operating with the World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank.

More and more, the talk among Western elites is about locking in as much
as possible the status quo, which favors the West, so that it will be
harder for the newcomers to overcome. The TPP was sold as a way to set
the rules before China gains much more power. A former Obama
administration official advised that now might be the best time to
undertake UN Security Council reform, before China and other
uncooperative powers become more powerful. "A new US administration may
be able to advance a proposal to address the Security Council's
anachronistic makeup while perpetuating a council that Washington can
work with."101

For Westerners, the challenge will be to plan for a future that will not
be solely run by them, but which they can live with. [[Handovers have
been]{.mark} **historically difficult and fraught**]{.underline}---more
often than not, [decided by **bloody [contests]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
One could [[envisage]{.underline}]{.mark} different scenarios, some
already described in the earlier chapter on conflict, of [**military
contests** between [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [and [China]{.mark}]{.underline}, or the
United States [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} China with
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, or the United States with NATO against
Russia. Without delivering a knockout blow by one side or the other,
these [contests would]{.underline} most likely [pit West against East,
creating]{.underline} something akin to **[[a new Cold
War]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Even if there were a knockout blow by the
United States against China, it is hard to imagine a defeated China
deferring permanently to the West. Its population has been imbued with
such a narrative about the injustices by the West against China that any
defeat or setback would be confirmation that the United States and West
are dead set against a rising China.

Perhaps the most harmful effect of such a contest would be to convince
both sides that neither is trustworthy. For the non-West, it would
confirm the suspicion that the West does not want to relinquish its
leadership position. For the West, it would make it harder to ever reach
out and help establish a truly global system.

Need for a Second-Generation US and Western Leadership Model

[[War is **not**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and should not be,
**[[inevitable]{.underline}]{.mark}** as the West struggles with the
growing clout of China and other developing states on the world stage.
Unlike during other transitions, the tools exist for ensuring more
peaceful outcomes. They will require Western acquiescence to greater
roles for the developing world to set and implement new rules of the
road for the international order. A key feature of the post-1945 US
design for the world order is its multilateralist structures. Many of
these operate below most people's radar. This plumbing of the
international system has enabled the daily functioning of globalization.
To keep it viable, China, as well as other developing countries, must be
accorded more representation. There are too many long-term risks
involved, for example, in China having only the equivalent of France's
voting rights in the IMF, when it is the first or second economic power
in the world. This is how resentments are nurtured---all the more
dangerous in China's case because of its underlying "century of
humiliation" mental complex.

[[As **emerging tech**]{.mark}**nologies** [come online, the lack of
**a**]{.mark} **truly [global]{.mark} institutional [framework]{.mark}**
[could be]{.mark}]{.underline} particularly
**[[dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Assuring the future security of
the Internet is particularly important in this regard, because all the
new emerging technologies---bio, 3D printing, robotics, big data---take
for granted a secure, global Internet. Everyone loses if cyber crime and
cyber terrorism undermine the Internet. In the worstcase scenarios, in
which cyber crime proliferates or strong national borders fragment the
Internet, an Atlantic Council study, as mentioned, found that the
economic costs could be as much as \$90 trillion out to 2030, in
addition to the risk of open conflict.102

Besides bringing the emerging powers into leadership roles in the
panoply of multilateral institutions, the United States will need to
temper its often "exemptionalist" stance to ensure the survival of the
multilateralist order. According to the Council on Foreign Relations'
Patrick Stewart, a prominent scholar of global governance, one of the
persistent paradoxes of the post-1945 decades has been that
[the]{.underline} "[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[is]{.underline} at once [**the world's most vocal champion** of **a
rules-based international order**]{.underline} and the power most
insistent on opting out of the constraints that it hopes to see binding
on others."103 [No country has **the networks and
connections**]{.underline} that [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [does]{.underline}, but the system is now
polycentric, rather than unipolar, and others resent the "exceptional"
privileges that the United States claims. The Global Trends works have
talked about the need for a new model of US global leadership. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [needs to]{.underline} be
**[guid]{.underline}**ing t[he international system as a "**first among
equals**,"]{.underline} and willing to play by its own rules.
Paradoxically, [[there is]{.underline}]{.mark} likely to be
[**[no]{.mark} vibrant global-[governance]{.mark} system** [without
US]{.mark} and Western [leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}, but too much
domineering behavior could doom it.

Even if the United States adapted its global role, this is not to say
that the tensions and differences with many emerging powers would all
disappear, or that the governance system would function seamlessly. In
addition to the growing number of new state actors, the increasing
importance of nonstate actors adds a new complexity to the functioning
of global institutions. Moreover, there are clear-cut differences
between the West and emerging powers on values-based issues, such as
democracy promotion and the responsibility to protect. Many
developing-country publics still resent Western colonialism and equate
any intrusion with past historical wrong. They point to the 2011
humanitarian intervention in Libya, for example, as cover for the
Western goal of regime change. Hence, the UN Security Council failure to
stop the fighting in Syria, with more than two hundred thousand killed
and 7.6 million displaced. Russia and China want to make a stand against
the United States and the West getting their way and ousting the Assad
regime. On the other hand, the lack of a solution smacks more of anarchy
than global governance. Certainly, it shows one of the gaps that
remains, and likely will remain, limiting global governance because of
differences in values.

[The speed with which new technologies]{.underline} are
**[com]{.underline}**ing [online]{.underline} and becoming an important
political, military, and economic tool---for both good and
bad---[carries **big risks**]{.underline} for global governance. Stewart
Patrick lists four potential new technologies that "cry out for
regulation": [[**geoengineering**, **drones**, **synthetic
bio**]{.mark}**logy**, [and **nano**]{.mark}**technology**.
[Without]{.mark}]{.underline} some setting of
[[rules]{.underline}]{.mark} for their operation, there is the
[[risk]{.underline}]{.mark} of major disruptions, if not
**[[catastrophes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, stemming from their abuse. The
recent advances in synthetic biology lower the bar to abuse by amateurs
and terrorists alike, forever affecting human DNA. Geoengineering
involves planetary-scale interventions that could interfere with complex
climatic systems.

However cumbersome, politically unpopular, and ineffective at times,
[there is **little alternative** to **increased global cooperation** if
one does not want to see **higher risks of conflict** and **economic
degradation**]{.underline}. Without some sort of bolstered global
governance, the West would end up with less sovereignty in a
"dog-eat-dog" world, in which it was increasingly in the minority. But
can the United States and the West rise to the challenge of investing in
a global-governance system that will not always favor their interests on
every issue? Historically, the United States could be especially
generous because it was on top of the world in about everything after
the Second World War. Europeans came to truly believe in pooling
sovereignty and joint governance after centuries of internecine
conflict. The tough economic times at home have seen US and European
publics become distrustful of overarching multilateral institutions,
believing the will of the United States or individual European countries
will not be served. It is oftentimes easier for political leaders to
fall in with the public mood rather than display leadership that might
appear to work against it.

## AT: Indo-Pak War

### 2AC\-\--Link Turn\-\--Nuclear Exhange

#### Link turn\-\--US heg [prevents]{.underline} India-Pakistan nuclear exchange. 

**White 19**, associate professor at the Johns Hopkins University School
of Advanced International Studies, nonresident fellow at the Brookings
Institution, Former senior adviser and director for South Asian affairs
at the National Security Council, 3-6-2019, (Joshua, \"Why America can't

kav)

Here is what we know about the most serious India-Pakistan crisis in
more than a decade. On February 14, the Pakistan-based terrorist
organization Jaish-e-Mohammed attacked a paramilitarfy convoy in Pulwama
in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. India, on the cusp of a
general election, retaliated against its neighbor in the early hours of
February 26 with a deep air strike targeting a terrorist camp near the
town of Balakot, squarely within Pakistani territory. The following day,
Indian and Pakistani forces were involved in an air skirmish in which at
least one Indian MiG-21 was shot down; its pilot was captured and
subsequently released. Both nuclear-armed countries placed their
military forces on alert, and sustained vigorous artillery barrages
across the Line of Control that divides them.

Although it might be too early to reconstruct precisely what transpired,
the crisis yields some important lessons for the United States. With
perhaps the exception of the Korean peninsula, [India and Pakistan
represent the world's most likely venue for nuclear conflict. And
Washington remains deeply involved with both countries, viewing India as
a long-term partner that can play a supporting role in blunting China's
rise, and Pakistan as a frustrating but indispensable player in the
negotiations to conclude America's 17-year war in
Afghanistan.]{.underline}

[One unpleasant lesson is that the United States cannot meaningfully
inhibit the sort of Pakistani risk taking that might spark military
escalation with its larger neighbor. Americans have tried for years to
stop Pakistan from using proxy militants to frustrate India. They have
attempted a dizzying array of strategies: Increase security assistance
and decrease security assistance; broaden diplomatic dialogue and
constrain diplomatic dialogue; pursue cooperative counterterrorism
strikes and engage in unilateral counterterrorism strikes; encourage
international engagement and press for international isolation;
threaten, cajole, praise, plead, and ignore.]{.underline}

If anything, the past several weeks have served as a reminder that
neither the United States nor India has the tools to fundamentally
alter, in the near term, what has been a long-standing attribute of
Pakistan's foreign policy. Perhaps Pakistani leaders have made quiet
efforts to rein in India-focused terrorists, but the outcomes speak for
themselves, and damningly: Attacks on Indian territory have continued
unabated. It is foolish to assume that some uniquely clever or
marginally novel combination of entrées from Washington's policy menu
will change this fact.

[The United States can, however, still reduce nuclear risk in South
Asia, first by helping India become more resilient in the face of
terrorist provocation. Largely under the radar, U.S.-India partnerships
in law enforcement, counterterrorism, intelligence sharing, and border
security have advanced considerably, but even more can be done. With
India's political resilience in mind, U.S. officials should also
encourage their Indian counterparts to rethink their often heavy-handed
management of Jammu and Kashmir, which gives unintended succor to
terrorist groups and other enemies of the state.]{.underline}

[Meanwhile, Washington can deliver a clearer public message to
Islamabad. It should assert that Pakistan bears responsibility for these
attacks---not because of any incontrovertible public
evidence]{.underline} that shows directive control by the state over
terrorist organizations, [but because the flagrant openness with which
supposedly "banned" groups operate]{.underline} within Pakistan
suggests, at minimum, a policy of intentional state negligence. [The
United States and its partners should]{.underline} avoid the temptation
to engage the sudden bouts of hyper-legalism that afflict Pakistani
leaders following a terrorist attack in India, and [focus instead on the
uncomfortable truths that are already plainly in public
view.]{.underline}

Moreover, [together with its allies, the United States should continue
to take steps to limit Pakistan's access to global financial markets,
and perhaps even the largesse of international financial institutions,
until Pakistan demonstrates that it is meaningfully addressing the
fundraising and operations of India-focused terrorist
groups.]{.underline} This is best done matter-of-factly and without
bluster, building on U.S. officials' recent efforts in the Financial
Action Task Force. Granted, Pakistan's security elite are unlikely to
fundamentally change course, and even Prime Minister Imran Khan---who
has secured large loans from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
to temporarily bolster Pakistan's weak macroeconomic position---might
feel like he does not need the wider financial backing that the United
States can provide. Nonetheless, Pakistan's economic self-isolation
might, over a longer horizon, serve to clarify for the country's elites
the real choices they face.

Although some Pakistani officials admit in private that groups such as
Jaish-e-Mohammed are indeed a scourge of the state, they fret about
"blowback" should the government act overwhelmingly against them.
Americans might scoff at this argument. But ordinary Pakistanis have
indeed suffered greatly from terrorism and fear poking a hornet's nest.
When I traveled to Pakistan in January, I was astonished at how
dramatically the fear of terrorism had subsided; there was a palpable
optimism about tourism and a return to normalcy.

The United States can and should find a way to acknowledge this concern
while pointing out that Pakistan has already shown the world that it can
deftly leverage all instruments of national power---law enforcement,
media messaging, police and paramilitary forces, international
partnerships, development assistance, and, of course, military
operations---to degrade groups that it sees as a threat, such as the
Pakistani Taliban. America's message can be that uprooting India-focused
terrorists is a decision that Pakistan itself has to make, one that
speaks to its character and its desire to participate fully in the
international community. Washington should signal that it will accept
gradualism so long as Pakistan's efforts are thorough and sustained.

[There is a second important and unpleasant conclusion that American
policy makers can already draw from these recent events: The decision
not to inhibit Indian retaliation comes at some cost.]{.underline}

For many years after the 2001--02 crisis precipitated by a
Jaish-e-Mohammed attack on the Indian Parliament, the political
leadership in New Delhi sought to deflect Pakistani provocation, avoid
escalation, and deny terrorist groups the satisfaction of disrupting
India's steady rise on the world stage. This strategy of restraint
changed in September 2016, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi responded
to a terrorist attack on an Indian army facility at Uri by conducting,
and then publicly touting, so-called surgical strikes against terrorist
infrastructure in Pakistani Kashmir. The strikes were of questionable
tactical value. But what they lacked in producing deterrence they made
up for in catharsis---Modi was widely hailed within India for his
boldness. He was also lucky in that Pakistan chose to deny that the
surgical strikes ever happened. As a result, many Indians felt confident
that they had outmaneuvered their Pakistani rivals with a new template
for action.

They also concluded that perhaps they had found a newly sympathetic ear
in Washington. Some days after the attack at Uri, National Security
Adviser Susan Rice telephoned her counterpart in New Delhi to offer
American support; the readout of that call "reiterated \[the U.S.\]
expectation that Pakistan take effective action to combat and
delegitimize United Nations-designated terrorist individuals and
entities." Then, after India's surgical strikes, a senior White House
official struck a careful tone, but pointedly noted that "we do
empathize with the Indians' perception that they need to respond
militarily."

[I served in the White House during this period, and remember well that
Pakistani officials and media commentators were surprised and dismayed
at these comments. They should not have been.]{.underline} Many of the
most contentious negotiations in advance of the 2015 visit by the
previous Pakistani prime minister---the last official White House visit
by a Pakistani leader---revolved around what Pakistan would say and what
its military would do regarding India-focused terrorists. Assurances had
been given, and had not been kept.

If Uri was an inflection point, this latest crisis---with even more
assertive Indian military actions accompanied by even stronger signals
of American acquiescence to Indian retaliation---might be a watershed.
After the terrorist attack on Pulwama, President Donald Trump hinted
that "India is looking at something very strong," and National Security
Adviser John Bolton was quoted by the Indian government as being
supportive of India's right to self-defense against cross-border
terrorism. Following India's retaliatory strikes, however, Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo pivoted quickly, urging both sides to "exercise
restraint, and avoid escalation at any cost."

India's decisions since 2016 to retaliate against terrorist provocations
are both politically explicable and emotionally satisfying. But they
have also had the effect of raising the minimum, politically acceptable
threshold of response in a way that makes future crises riskier. Over
the past decade, I have observed or participated in more than a dozen
war games that sought to model future India--Pakistan conflicts, and one
lesson from those simulations is that neither party can reliably judge
how or whether its retaliation will escalate the conflict closer to the
nuclear threshold. Neither side can be assured that its move will be the
final one.

For this reason, [the recent crisis should prompt questions about the
wisdom and sustainability of telegraphing that the United States will
tacitly support a major act of Indian retaliation but will disapprove of
further escalation by New Delhi even if Pakistan raises the stakes with
a counterstrike.]{.underline}

[One of the dirty little secrets of diplomacy is that exerting influence
on friends is often harder than exerting influence on adversaries. The
much-welcomed trend toward a deeper U.S.-India relationship has
naturally raised each country's expectation of support from the other in
times of trouble. Perhaps American officials judge that counseling
restraint of a close but independent-minded partner such as Prime
Minister Modi in the face of sustained provocation would be pointless.
Or that structural changes in the international system are making it
harder for the United States to unilaterally influence the course of
global emergencies. But at the very least, the February incidents should
prompt U.S. planners to press New Delhi for more substantive U.S.-India
conversations on crisis management; to find ways to publicly intimate
that U.S. support for India during a crisis is in principle assured but
in practice not unbounded; and to encourage their Indian counterparts to
undertake realistic assessments of the value of military actions that
generate more political fervor than actual deterrence.]{.underline}

//AA

Our collective [failure to end the pandemic]{.underline} now [will cause
even deeper and more costly problems in the future]{.underline} At the
Global Health Summit in May 2021, G20 leaders declared that the pandemic
"will not be over until all countries are able to bring the disease
under control and therefore, large-scale, global, safe, effective and
equitable vaccination ... remains our top priority." Campaigners could
be forgiven, then, for feeling optimistic that meaningful action to
address vaccine inequity would be taken at the G7 leaders' meeting in
Cornwall in June, or the G20 finance ministers' meeting in Venice in
July. Alas, they have been sorely disappointed. The members of the G7
pledged to share just 870 million of their 3 billion surplus doses by
the middle of 2022, a paltry sum compared with the 11 billion doses that
are urgently needed to reach global herd immunity. And the G20 produced
little more than excruciatingly vague "support for collaborative
efforts" on global vaccine distribution. Meanwhile, since that grand
declaration in May, covid-19 has continued to wreak havoc around the
world: an additional 400,000 people have died as the global death toll
has ticked past four million. Africa finds itself in the grips of a
truly devastating third wave of infections, with only 1.4 per cent of
the continent's population fully vaccinated. [There will be a price to
pay for this inaction even beyond the untold human cost. Our collective
failure to end the pandemic now will create and compound even deeper and
more costly problems in the future. **The** immediate knock-on
**effects**, including for the West, **will be severe.**]{.underline}
But [this historic **failure of multilateralism is** also
**undermining** the **trust** and incentives **necessary for effective**
international **cooperation on** the **other existential challenges** of
the day -- most **notably, climate change.**]{.underline} In the short
term, for as long as the virus is raging anywhere in the world, variants
will continue to emerge that have the potential to send us all back to
square one. The World Health Organisation warned last week that there is
a "strong likelihood" that more dangerous variants will develop that may
be even more challenging to control, underlining that ["the pandemic is
nowhere near finished". We're already seeing the damage that can be
done]{.underline} by such variants, even in highly immunised countries.
Cases are rising in Australia among fully vaccinated people due to the
spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant. The United Kingdom,
having vaccinated 68 per cent of its population, is now facing worker
shortages, with up to 20 per cent of the workforce in some firms
self-isolating. In June, a covid-19 outbreak at China's Yantian port
threatened to hold up 5 per cent of global freight capacity. [These
disruptions are, in turn, contributing to rising inflation due to
increased commodity prices.]{.underline} But [the economic impact of the
'great divergence' in the global pandemic response is just
beginning.]{.underline} Last year, the International Chamber of Commerce
estimated that vaccine hoarding by rich countries could cost the global
economy \$9 trillion, half of which would be borne by rich countries
facing supply chain disruptions. In the medium term, [the needlessly
prolonged pandemic is likely to **undermine global security and
stability.**]{.underline} Pandemic-driven [social unrest is on the
rise]{.underline} around the world, including in Africa. The
International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that frustration over
governments' handling of the crisis, as well as mounting inequality and
corruption, may lead to "a new wave of unrest" that could hinder the
recovery from the pandemic, especially in developing countries. Again,
we're already seeing this play out. Nigeria reported recently that the
pandemic has worsened the security situation in the country, as 100
people have been killed during a nationwide lockdown. Nigerian Minister
of Interior Rauf Aregbesola attributed the killings to the frustration
caused by rising unemployment and restrictions on movement. In South
Africa, more than 70 people have been killed and over 1,300 arrested
amid riots triggered by the jailing of former president Jacob Zuma. The
health ministry warned that the country's vaccination rollout and other
essential healthcare services have been severely disrupted, and there
are also reports of an impending food shortage. The European Asylum
Support Office warned that the risk of conflict-related displacement is
likely to increase due to the pandemic -- raising the spectre of the
2015 refugee crisis, which pushed the EU's multilateral institutions to
the brink of collapse. Of course, [**the greatest threat to global
stability is climate change**. There are depressing parallels between
the international responses to the covid-19 pandemic and climate
change.]{.underline} [Like the climate crisis, **the pandemic reveals a
lot about our inability to act in our own** enlightened **self-interest
when faced with an urgent** and obvious **threat**, and provides
overwhelming evidence of the humanitarian **and** economic **costs of
inaction.**]{.underline} As so eloquently argued by the Financial
Times's Martin Wolf, "even against such a self-evidently global threat,
where the costs are huge and immediate, we seem unable to act with
essential urgency," and, consequently, when it comes to the climate, "it
is impossible to imagine we will do much more than fiddle while the
planet burns." Needless to say, [truly global cooperation is required to
effectively address the climate crisis]{.underline}, which is arguably
an even more complex and profound problem than covid-19. But the trust
and goodwill such cooperation demands have been decimated by the West's
short-sighted nationalism in the face of the pandemic. It is hard to
overstate the anger that vaccine inequity has created in Africa, where a
meagre 4.3 vaccines have been administered per 100 people (compared to
77 per 100 in North America and 75 per 100 in Europe). [We have the
resources and capabilities to end the pandemic everywhere; it is simply
a matter of political will.]{.underline}

[Why multilateralism is in such a mess today boils down to three
reasons: disillusionment with globalisation, lacklustre narratives in
support of multilateralism, and the inadequacy of existing multilateral
rules to meet new challenges.]{.underline} Ups and downs in the lives of
individual international institutions are not new, but **[the malaise
that now afflicts multilateralism is unprecedented]{.underline}** in
range and depth. It transcends issue-areas, and occurs at a time when
the need for sensible rules of international cooperation has greater
urgency than ever before. Even as trade wars rage outside, the Dispute
Settlement Body of the World Trade Organization (WTO) finds itself
paralysed due to the blocked appointments/re-appointments of judges in
its Appellate Body. [Public awareness of climate change as a global
emergency may have increased, but the United States has at the same time
delivered a serious blow to the mitigation regime by moving to withdraw
from the Paris Agreement.]{.underline} In his remarkable interview with
The Economist in November this year, [French President Macron declared
the "brain-death" of the NATO and pointed to the fragility of
Europe.]{.underline} Impending Brexit is one thorn in the side of the
European project; the rise of the Alternative for Deutschland (AfD)
party in Germany is another. [**Multilateralism**, in both its universal
and non-universal versions, and across economic and security issues,
**is under severe strain.**]{.underline} Explaining the malaise [It is
commonplace]{.underline} --- especially by those with liberal and/or
centrist inclinations in politics --- [to attribute the crisis of
multilateralism to two factors.]{.underline} First, many observers point
the finger at [President Trump and his "America first" agenda. Is it
surprising then, they ask, that others follow suit when the world's
largest economy behaves with such great irresponsibility and chooses to
turn its back on the very system that it had once led the way in
creating? Second, some see Trump's politics as part of a broader
phenomenon involving the rise of strongmen leaders with populist
inclinations who fan nationalist sentiment, framing the rights and
interests of local populations as pitted against those of a "global
elite."]{.underline} Both explanations, however, are deeply misguided.
Nor is the wrong-headedness of such applications purely an academic
matter. Rather, [the knee-jerk solutions that they result in are likely
to worsen the malaise of multilateralism.]{.underline} Reacting to
Trump's message of "Make America great again," Macron countered with
"Make our planet great again." This was not a bad response per se,
especially given the crudeness of Trump's pledge. Yet, the Yellow Vests
protests showed that Macron's (probably well-meant) moral high-horsiness
did not find many takers. [**The problems of multilateralism predate the
arrival of Trump** on the international scene]{.underline}; failure to
recognise this will keep taking us down the same cul-de-sac as Macron's
"Make our planet great again." Take the case of trade multilateralism.
True, Trump may have called the WTO "the single worst deal ever made"
and severely dented the system by launching his supposedly "good, and
easy to win" trade wars. But amidst this drama, it is too often
forgotten that dissatisfaction with WTO functioning has been brewing for
years. The recurrence of deadlocks in the Doha Round for over the last
15 years is a clear sign of discontent from multiple stakeholders (and
not just the US). Similarly, it is worth recalling that although many
blame the Trump administration for the wreckage that is the WTO's
Appellate Body today, the practice of actually blocking appointments and
re-appointments of judges in fact goes back to the Obama administration
(although admittedly not on the same scale as practiced by the current
US administration). It was also under President Obama that the US
dabbled in the rhetoric of protecting American workers, showed great
reluctance to make concessions during Doha negotiations. And again, it
was the Obama administration that precipitated a turn away from the
multilateralism of WTO and towards the (mega-) regionalism of the
Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and Trans-Pacific
Partnership. [Trump's angry and public pronouncements against various
multilateral institutions, or the rhetoric of some populist movements
against the global order, have certainly multiplied the problems facing
multilateralism. But they are not the root cause.]{.underline} Why
multilateralism is in such a mess today boils down to three reasons:
disillusionment with globalisation, lacklustre narratives in support of
multilateralism, and the inadequacy of existing multilateral rules to
meet new challenges. [First, backing Trump's narrative of "America
First" or the Brexiters' slogan of "Take back control" is the fact that
significant proportions of the electorates of these countries believe
that the gains of globalisation have passed them by. They attribute
increasing inequality within their society]{.underline}, and the job
losses and declining wages that they personally endure, to the costs of
international trade. The hardships that these groups suffer have several
causes, which range from technological change to inadequate welfare
mechanisms that could allow for better wealth distribution. But trade is
often the easy scapegoat, especially as blame can be all too
conveniently attributed to international deal-making. The current US
administration is an example of a government that has effectively
harnessed this discontent --- perhaps even stirred it further by
building a narrative that links domestic inequalities and poverty within
the US to multilateral governance. But [this disillusionment with the
system is a real and potent force, which will survive irrespective of
what happens in the upcoming US elections.]{.underline} [Second, a solid
and convincing counter-narrative has been missing.]{.underline} Telling
the malcontents and the disillusioned --- especially if they face
personal economic hardships amidst increasing inequality --- that they
should think about the planet first will not reassure them. If anything,
such [narratives]{.underline} will only [exacerbate]{.underline} the
[backlash against those increasingly seen as part of a "global elite"
and the values of internationalism that they represent.]{.underline} The
takeaway for many parts of the electorate (in different countries) from
such cavalier attitudes will likely be along the lines of 'only Mr Trump
understands my pain, only the AfD is willing to stand up for my rights.'
[Third, the liberal fixation on Trump as the root cause for the decline
of multilateralism diverts attention from another equally serious cause:
the rise of an increasingly assertive China.]{.underline} One reason for
this blind spot may be that [**China** itself has been doing an
impressive job --- at least until recently \[1\] --- in **presenting
itself as a guardian of** globalisation and
**multilateralism.**]{.underline} Declarations of support for the
system, for example at the World Economic Forum by President Xi, stand
out in stark contrast to the havoc wreaked on the system via President
Trump's angry tweets and trade wars. But recent scholarship by Henry
Farrell and Abe Newman on "weaponized interdependence" has begun to
highlight the use of global economic networks for geostrategic
purposes.\[2\] Combine these insights with China's meteoric rise and
controversial expansionism in its region and beyond (e.g., via the Belt
and Road Initiative), and it is clear that **[the underlying premises of
the postwar multilateral system are being put into
question.]{.underline}** Much of the post-war order was built on an
assumption of the virtues of economic interdependence, which were
supposed to bring nations together and promote peace. But [if
multilateral rules to promote economic interdependence have been used
--- or could be used in the future --- by "systemic rivals" to gain
geo-economic advantage, then a **backlash** against these rules **is
bound to come** sooner or later.]{.underline} While the US has voiced
these concerns most vociferously, others too have been raising them in
different settings as they argue in favour of institutional reform and
updating. Finding sustainable solutions To fix the malaise of
multilateralism, technical solutions --- for example, improving the
WTO's Dispute Settlement Mechanism --- will of course be important. But
given the deep-rooted nature of the challenge, a purely technocratic
response will not suffice. Four sets of additional measures will be
crucial. First, the only way that we will be able to bring the
discontented many on board (and bring them on board we must, if we are
to restore trust in the system) is by taking their concerns seriously.
This means reconsidering past trade-offs and developing a new bargain on
globalisation with better distributive mechanisms, both domestically and
internationally. Trump-bashing --- and its equivalent in other countries
--- on its own and ridiculing populist supporters will only exacerbate
polarisation. Second, [multilateralism will need a brand new
narrative.]{.underline} This narrative will have to convey clearly why
reformed multilateralism is of direct benefit to citizens across the
board, and not only tomorrow but also today. Appealing to global public
goods and the welfare of future generations are likely to prove
insufficient as rationales, especially to those who feel shortchanged
and are enduring economic hardships. This new narrative will need to
have individual and group appeal. It will also need to work across
different levels of politics --- local, regional, national, and global.

## AT: Iran War

accessed 7/5/22)//jd

It is by now clear that Donald Trump does not have an answer to one of
the most bedeviling foreign policy problems of the last four decades:
Iran. In this, he is not alone. Since the Islamic Republic's founding in
1979, no American president has been able to figure out how best to
manage the challenge that Tehran poses for stability and American
interests in the Middle East. But three years into the Trump
administration's erratic and aggressive Iran policy, Washington's aims
and strategy are more adrift than ever. Although it is uncertain whether
Trump's presidency will last another year or five---and whether a
progressive administration will eventually succeed him---the time is
ripe for the United States to develop an intentional, coherent, and
effective policy toward Iran. American voters of different political
stripes are raising fundamental questions about their role in the
world---about U.S. core interests and priorities in a changing global
order---creating an unprecedented opportunity to rethink U.S. foreign
policy, especially in the Middle East. When the time comes, a new plan
with a strong foundation will be needed. [The principles of
de-escalation, diplomacy, and containment should guide U.S. policy
toward Iran going forward.]{.underline} The 2015 nuclear deal with Iran
(the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA) would have provided
an ideal springboard for such a policy. But Trump has withdrawn from
that agreement, and rejoining will not be possible. [If the deal
collapses entirely, Washington will have to rebuild trust in order to
start new, broad negotiations; dial down conflict points; and find less
risky ways to challenge and contain Iran.]{.underline} To this end, [the
United States' first step must be to accept that, while Iran is a
problematic actor, Washington has only a limited capacity to control its
behavior. Second, the United States must compartmentalize regional and
foreign policy as it relates to Iran. Iran cannot continue to be the
lens through which Washington evaluates relationships with every other
country in the region,]{.underline} or its basis for responding to every
crisis. [Third, the United States must right-size the perception of the
Iranian threat---and manage political expectations about the possibility
of reducing it.]{.underline} [Fourth, the U.S. government must decide
how best to engage Iran in diplomacy, and what format this engagement
should take.]{.underline} In the formulation of a new Iran policy,
taking lessons from the past will be important. Barack Obama's policy of
engagement held promise, especially the nuclear deal. Importantly, the
JCPOA successfully mitigated the possibility that Iran could pursue
nuclear weapons. The agreement thus put a tangible constraint on one
aspect of Iran's most threatening behavior, and avoided further
U.S.--Iran tension over Obama's most serious Iran policy priority.
Further, the JCPOA created a framework to negotiate on other important
matters, including Iran's missile program and involvement in regional
wars. Obama's diplomatic engagement came with its own controversies,
however. It didn't slow down Tehran's regional meddling, whether in
Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, or elsewhere. Opponents of the JCPOA also argued
that Iran accelerated its missile program while Washington was focused
on negotiating the nuclear deal.1 More than likely, though, the JCPOA
would have yielded additional positive results down the road. We will
never know. Worse still, the Trump administration's post-withdrawal
campaign, which it dubbed ["maximum pressure," has only emboldened
Iran.]{.underline} Tehran has increased its military activity, raised
its political demands on partners, and begun to downgrade its
implementation of the nuclear deal (which is supposed to remain in force
for the remaining members, but is critically weakened without the United
States). The Trump administration's "maximum pressure" campaign has only
emboldened Iran. Still, new policy must go further than a repudiation of
Trump's failures. Through both the Trump and Obama administrations---and
indeed those of all the other presidencies since 1979---there has been a
lack of reasonable and balanced assessments of the true threat that Iran
poses to the United States and its interests. In some ways, the chaos of
the Trump presidency has opened a door to reevaluate old assumptions,
and to reconsider the goals for Iran and the Middle East that
Washington's strategists and politicians have long taken for granted.
Barriers to Dialogue with Iran The basis for formulating a new approach
to Iran must be a clear-eyed assessment of the challenges that Iran
poses---and the ways that past American policy has failed to meet those
challenges or evolve with them. One of the biggest barriers to
Washington's dialogue with Iran is mutual lack of trust, which dates to
the founding of the Islamic Republic. Following the Iranian Revolution
in 1979, anti-Americanism became one of the main tenets of the new
regime. Washington, for its part, was scarred by the 444-day hostage
crisis, during which a group of Iranian students and revolutionaries
detained fifty-two Americans in the U.S. embassy in Tehran.2 This
watershed moment traumatized the minds of Americans and their officials
alike. It also affected officials of the Islamic Republic, some of whom
later regretted the hostage taking, believing it has since "colored
relations between the two countries."3 This history of mistrust made the
2015 JCPOA agreement, between Iran and the P5+1 (the five permanent
members of the UN Security Council plus Germany), all the more
significant. The nuclear deal not only resolves a long-standing
international concern, but was also the culmination of years of
dialogue, which only came to fruition when the United States engaged
Iran directly. But, as mentioned above, the nuclear deal had its
limitations: while it ensured that the United States and Iran could
engage and compromise on one important matter of substance, the nuclear
talks did not curb or counter Iran in the region. Candidate Trump made
it clear that, as president, he would not hesitate to pull the United
States out of the deal, and he did exactly that in May 2018. As a
result, American credibility, reliability, and reputation as a state
party to an international agreement has taken a real hit. The argument
goes: why negotiate and make deals with the United States if subsequent
administrations can then choose to ignore them---and seek to punish
allies simply for upholding their end of the agreement? [American
credibility, reliability, and reputation as a state party to an
international agreement has taken a real hit. The problems created by
the withdrawal, however, go beyond damage to American credibility and
reliability.]{.underline} The increased partisan nature of U.S. politics
has become brutally apparent to Iranians. Iranian officials now believe
that it is futile to negotiate with a Democratic administration, because
a later Republican administration will likely overturn its decisions. To
them, engagements taken on by a Republican administration are more
likely to last and be respected by subsequent administrations. This
effectively means that Iranians are less likely to engage with a
Democratic president than they are with a Republican. In addition,
today, as a result of [Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign, Iran and the
United States are locked in a spiral of escalating tensions with little
or no off-ramp.]{.underline} The lack of direct communication between
the two governments means that there are more serious risks of
escalation following a miscommunication or misperception. The campaign
has also led to a hardening of Iranian positions vis-à-vis Washington:
the domestic political cost of negotiating with the United States for an
Iranian official is too high, especially after the assassination of
Qassem Soleimani---a high-level and popular Iranian official.4 Many
Iranians do not condone what Soleimani did, and those who protested
against the regime in November 2019 have not forgotten their discontent.
But [the threat from an external enemy has brought them together, at
least momentarily, in a show of unity.]{.underline} The persistent
problem when assessing U.S.--Iran relations is that anti-Americanism is
endemic to the political and security leadership of the Islamic Republic
under the current supreme leader, and being anti-Iran is endemic to the
American political sphere (and arguably so for both major political
parties). Because of these dynamics, many influential decision-makers in
the United Kingdom, for example, believe that a new deal is
"inconceivable until \[Iranian supreme leader Ali\] Khamenei dies,"
according to a recent research paper that polled officials and
analysts.5 In the short term, the political climate in both Iran and the
United States will make it difficult for either side to compromise. The
United States is in full election mode, and after parliamentary
elections in February 2020, Iran will hold presidential elections in
2021. These elections will happen at a turbulent time for the Islamic
Republic, following the nationwide protests in November 2019, which it
brutally suppressed, and the show of unity that followed Soleimani's
assassination. The current environment, as well as the Iranian Guardian
Council's disqualifying of thousands of moderate candidates from the
parliamentary elections, suggest that the Iranian government is likely
to become yet more conservative.6 The greater alignment between factions
in Iran's political system, which Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign
has partly caused, could make it easier to build a consensus in favor of
a new deal. However, conservatives in Iran are tougher negotiators and
less likely to compromise---in other words, the new Iranian consensus
may be for an even more hard-line position. American Priorities in the
Region The United States has not clearly articulated what its policy
objectives are for Iran: To contain it? To change the current
government? To integrate it into international relations in order to
moderate its behavior? Each successive U.S. presidency has focused on
one or a combination of the above. But American objectives for Iran, and
the wider Middle East, have hit a wall, because events in the region
have often overtaken decisions and affected which policy options are
available. The United States must build internal consensus on what it
wants from Iran and the region. In other words, it should carefully
consider and revise its "list of grievances." American priorities in the
Middle East have included counterterrorism, stability, Israel's
security, and energy security---though the latter is becoming somewhat
less important.7 Ideally, [the United States should also prioritize
fostering the establishment of good governance in the
region.]{.underline} But the American government and voters are tired of
their country's decades of risky and costly involvement in the Middle
East. Expensive ventures and considerable policy failures have done
little to effectively secure the United States.8 Washington must decide
how much it can and wants to continue to contribute to regional
security. [Iran policy can only be determined in the context of a wider
Middle East strategy, which should promote regional peace and stability;
de-emphasize military means of promoting American interests; and seek to
de-escalate abusive governance and militarism by regional governments,
whether allied or opposed to the United States.]{.underline} American
priorities in Iran should include the release of dual nationals, the
respect of human rights, and containing Tehran's proxies, partners, and
allied hybrid actors, such as Hezbollah. With regard to Iran, Washington
should also be clearer about its aims. These will include the release of
dual nationals currently detained in Iran, the respect of human rights
in Iran, and containing Tehran's proxies, partners, and allied hybrid
actors, such as Hezbollah. The United States should perhaps even explore
cooperation with Iran in specific, limited areas, such as in Iraq and
Afghanistan. But Washington must ensure these goals are achievable:
issuing a twelve-point plan that is tantamount to calling for Iran to
utterly capitulate to the United States---as U.S. secretary of state
Michael Pompeo did in May 2018---will only make dialogue and the pursuit
of these goals more difficult.9 Such an approach simply entrenches
Iranian positions. Accepting Limits [The first and most important
component of a new U.S. policy on Iran is to understand that Iran is a
threat that can be managed, but not eradicated.]{.underline} Washington
can try to balance Tehran, contain it, discourage bad behavior, and
encourage better behavior, but it must also accept that it has a limited
ability to control Tehran. Further, Iran will continue to be an
important regional player. [The United States also cannot forcibly
prevent Iran from seeking a nuclear weapon or running militias in the
region, if that is what Tehran is set on doing---no amount of brute
force will remove Iranian knowledge of the nuclear program or erase
intent, for example. However, the United States can deal with Iran in
such a way as to secure incremental gains for American interests in the
Middle East. Washington's ability to coerce Iran is limited, but it can
persuade or induce Iran to adopt certain policies.]{.underline} As such,
Washington should treat Iran as a problematic actor, whose behavior it
cannot control or change by force. Expectations on what the United
States can achieve with Iran must be lowered. It is crucial to
understand that even if one problem area is resolved or managed, the
United States will always have areas of contention with the Islamic
Republic. The United States must manage the Iranian "problem," while
publicly stating what aspects of its behavior it finds most problematic,
so that Washington is able to maintain the moral high ground as it
navigates the complicated and difficult field of Middle Eastern
politics. Part of accepting that not everything is within Washington's
control involves deciding, firstly, what the United States can and
cannot abide in the region, and secondly, what it can and cannot abide
with respect to Iran, specifically. A formal policy review by a new U.S.
administration would help whittle American priorities down to a
realistic and limited set. In addition to justified fears of Iranian
nuclear capabilities and missile range, t[he United States could, for
instance, seek to limit Iran's ability to strike regional energy
infrastructure.]{.underline} Washington could also accept shared
influence in contested zones such as Yemen, Lebanon, and Iraq, rather
than always seeking to dominate them. On the other hand, [the U.S.
government would have to grudgingly accept that Iran will continue to
wield influence and counter American priorities through its proxies and
partners in Iran's near neighborhood, which includes current or former
U.S. priority areas such as the Arabian Peninsula, Iraq, Afghanistan,
and the Levant. A meaningful prioritization would allow the United
States a better chance to politically manage Iran: work with it when it
serves American interests, but at the same time contain Tehran and its
influence.]{.underline} The United States has ample experience dealing
with problematic countries whose policies it cannot simply ignore. For
example, Turkey frequently operates counter to American interests even
though it is a NATO treaty ally; China and Russia sometimes undermine
and sometimes directly resist U.S. policy in the region, but are far
more powerful than Iran and intersect with U.S. interests---sometimes
productively---on a global scale, rather than regionally. None of these
examples is an exact parallel to Iran, but each provides lessons from
which Washington can draw. In sum, the United States must establish
realistic priorities, and then manage domestic political expectations
about what can be achieved. Concretely, this would involve making some
difficult decisions that many in the U.S. system will struggle with. For
example, the United States will have to accept that Hezbollah and its
link with Tehran are intractable problems. The Islamic Republic's
relationship with Hezbollah is one that Tehran will not give up---there
is no scenario in which this is something that Tehran will consider.
Iran played a key role in setting up the group, and Hezbollah represents
and symbolizes the scale of Tehran's reach into the region.10 As a
Tehran-based Iranian academic close to the government put it: "The link
between Iran and Hezbollah is very close. It takes two to three weeks
for the cabinet to see the supreme leader, but Hassan Nasrallah will be
granted an audience faster and with more ease than \[Iranian president
Hassan\] Rouhani."11 Nasrallah's access to Iranian leadership
demonstrates the depth of Hezbollah's ties to Iran. Washington's
insistence on imposing wide-ranging sanctions on Lebanese officials
associated with Hezbollah, and its withholding of assistance to Lebanon
because of Iran's influence over the country (through Hezbollah), are
counterproductive. These measures prevent American officials from
engaging with a group that is problematic (to say the least), but
nevertheless, a significant player in the Lebanese political scene. Like
it or not, [Washington must work with the fact that Hezbollah has
evolved into a status quo movement operating largely within the
framework of the Lebanese state.]{.underline} The United States'
longtime designation of Hezbollah as a terrorist group is of similarly
questionable expediency: the designation cuts off first-hand insight
into the powerful militia-cum-political party. In addition, the
designation prevents "deconfliction" (the term for avoidance of military
engagement between two adversaries)[. Diplomatic contact with groups
like Hezbollah would be integral to the de-escalation of tensions and
crisis management. As it stands, the lack of communication that the
terrorist designation requires makes it more likely that, say, a
misunderstanding at the Lebanon--Israel border erupts into a major
conflict.]{.underline} Washington doesn't need to approve of or endorse
troubling groups in order to accept that dealing with such groups might
be practical. In addition, Washington's current stance on Hezbollah is
problematic because it sets the breaking of ties between Tehran and
Hezbollah as a precondition to meaningful dialogue with Iran. Since
Tehran will not give up that relationship, this precondition only limits
the United States' flexibility in its foreign policy. This is not to say
that a new approach will be easy to effect: changing Washington's
position on Hezbollah and Iran in this manner would represent a major
shift, and require overcoming political and psychological blockages in
place since 1979.

#### United States hegemony in the Middle East aligns with Iran's interests

Kennedy School, March 2016. (Graham, "US and Iranian interests:
Converging or Conflicting?", Belfer Center,

The nuclear issue has dominated relations between the US and Iran over
the past decade. Now that the two countries have shelved that issue by
agreeing to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, it is appropriate to
ask where and how the national interests of both countries converge and
conflict. In my class at Harvard, to lift students' sights above the
instant images and chatter that consumes most of their attention, I
sometimes ask them to step back \-- way back \-- and consider the
perspective of a strategist from Mars. Reviewing recent history, and
setting the nuclear issue aside, what would this Martian observe about
US-Iranian relations? As a start, the Martian would note that since it
took power in 1979, [the Islamic Republic has faced three primary
enemies: Soviet Union, Saddam's Iraq, and the Taliban's
Afghanistan]{.underline}. The Martian would point out that, in 1991,
[the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [won the Cold War and the
Soviet Union disappeared]{.underline}. In 2001, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [invaded Afghanistan and overthrew the
Taliban.]{.underline} And in 2003, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [invaded Iraq and quickly overthrew Saddam's
government]{.underline}. He would, of course, add that the United States
did not undertake these efforts for the sake of Iran. But it is
indisputable that, [in all three cases, Iran was a major
beneficiary]{.underline}. Looking to the future, [are US and Iranian
national interests more likely to be aligned or opposed?]{.underline}
The vitriol of the current political season in both countries suggests
the latter. But the Martian, and perhaps wise leadership on both sides,
would recognize distinct areas of convergence. [Two]{.underline} in
particular [stand out]{.underline} as opportunities for further (if
unstated) collaboration: [Iraq and Afghanistan.]{.underline} In Iraq,
Iranian and American interests align in the desire for a stable,
majority-dominated and thus Shia government in Bagdad, and in the war
against ISIL. First, consider how both countries' military capabilities
complement each other. While the US is unwilling to commit large numbers
of troops in Iraq, Iran has aggressively deployed special forces
advisers, weaponry and intelligence assets on the ground to combat ISIL.
On the other hand, while the Iranian air force is essentially obsolete,
the United States has sent some of its most sophisticated aircraft to
prosecute the war from the skies. The uncomfortable but undeniable fact
is that [Iranians and Americans are working in concert to fight ISIL in
Iraq.]{.underline} The mechanisms allow both a degree of deniability --
such as using Iraqis as intermediaries -- but the result is clear, and
positive: ISIL's rampage across Iraq has been halted and they have
suffered significant defeats, such as in Tikrit. This cooperation will
continue to be critical as Iraqi forces fight in Anbar Province and
prepare to take back Mosul. Politically, in the short term, both Iran
and the US seek to create a stable and unified Iraq (although these
goals diverge in the long-term). The interests of the two nations
converge more than they conflict in Afghanistan as well. This
convergence dates back to 2001 when Iran provided critical support to US
forces in Afghanistan to fight the Taliban and played a decisive role in
the formation of the new, US-backed Afghan government. According to Jim
Dobbins, who lead the US diplomatic efforts in Kabul in 2001, [it was
the Iranians who suggested the inclusion of elections in Afghanistan's

political compromise between Ashraf Ghani and Abdallah Abdallah that
allowed for Afghanistan's first democratic transfer of
power.]{.underline} Today, [both the United States and Iran are
concerned with the revival of the Taliban, the remnants of Al-Qaeda and
the newly formed Islamic State province in Afghanistan]{.underline}, and
Iran is particularly concerned about the drug trafficking and
lawlessness that prevails along its 900 km border with Afghanistan. The
list of issues on which American and Iranian interests diverge is a long
one, including the security of Israel, the political future of Syria,
and Iran\'s support for various groups across the region whom Americans
see as terrorists. But the dispassionate Martian observer\'s main point
would be to insist that the two states have much more in common than the
political leadership of either acknowledge.

### 2AC\-\--Iran War\-\--Hard Power

#### Only containment solves escalation with Iran -- every other policy empirically fails

I trace my interest in the Middle East back to the Iranian hostage
crisis---those 444 days of yellow ribbons, daily Nightline updates, and
an unrelenting wave of anger that swept through the United States.
People actually walked around with "Fuck Iran" buttons on their jackets,
and a comedian named Steve Dahl wrote a song called "Ayatollah"---to the
tune of the Knack's "My Sharona"---that threatened the Iranians with
nuclear annihilation. It was a confusing moment for a little kid who was
just waking up to the world beyond soccer practice, the New York
Yankees, and Wonderama. The subject hasn't gotten any less confusing
since. In the past 40 years, U.S. policymakers have endlessly debated a
central issue in U.S.-Middle East policy: What should the United States
do about Iran? The answer has often proved to be elusive in large part
because of domestic politics. The traumas of the late 1970s and early
1980s have rendered parts of the U.S. policy community needlessly
bellicose, others credulously dovish, and the remaining wary of both in
search of a "just right" strategy to modify Iran's behavior. But the
central question has now taken on a new urgency. U.S. President Donald
Trump's decision to kill Iranian military commander Qassem Suleimani in
a drone strike on Jan. 3 has raised fears of violent escalation---even
war---between the United States and Iran. It's time to directly address
the question of what exactly the United States can do about Iran---and
fortunately, there's a good answer available, even if it's not
satisfying for anyone in Washington. What's already clear is that the
current U.S. approach needs improvement. Despite his hit on Suleimani,
it is not at all clear what the president wants to achieve regarding
Iran. He has combined hawkish rhetoric with periodic offers to negotiate
with Tehran while pursuing a "maximum pressure" policy that until
recently did not employ military force. Depending on whom one asks or
who is doing the asking, the administration is seeking either full-scale
regime change or simply a more robust nuclear deal than the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)---the agreement negotiated by the
Obama administration, which set limits on Iran's nuclear program. This
confusion comes against the backdrop of the Democratic presidential
primary, in which all the leading candidates have declared their
intention to return to the JCPOA so long as Iran maintains its
commitment to the agreement (Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth
Warren)---or, in the case of Bernie Sanders, without any conditions at
all. Yet just because the Trump administration and the politics of
U.S.-Iran relations have imposed a binary choice on
policymakers---regime change or the existing nuclear agreement---does
not mean that there are no other possibilities. The U.S. government
could pursue, for example, a "grand bargain" with Iran that would settle
all the outstanding issues---notably, the nuclear program, Iran's use of
proxies to meddle in the region, and the release of Americans held in
Tehran---between the two countries. Yet [the most rational option under
the present circumstances is another strategy that no longer goes
mentioned in Washington: containment.]{.underline} Consider the other
potential strategies in turn. Regime change has, for obvious reasons,
become a scary term and a policy one would think officials and analysts
would want to avoid given the U.S. experience in Iraq, but it remains an
option if only because influential people continue to advocate for it.
It would not necessarily require a march on Tehran, but it would be
costly, requiring the United States to provide far more military,
political, and financial resources to Iran's opponents around the region
than current policy. This seems an unlikely scenario for two important
reasons: 1) The potential for further regional chaos is high, and 2) the
American people and Congress would likely be reluctant to support
policies that would undoubtedly include augmenting the already sizable
deployment of almost 45,000 American soldiers, sailors, and airmen in
the Persian Gulf. Returning to the JCPOA or negotiating a new nuclear
deal that addresses some of the defects in the original agreement---for
example, the failure to set limits on Iran's ballistic missile
program---is the flip side of Washington's Iran debate. Reviving the
JCPOA would mean acceptance of Iran's alleged right to develop nuclear
technology, sanctions relief, and the normalization of Tehran's
commercial ties with the world. It would also require implicit
acceptance of Iran's role in the region, especially its influential
positions in Lebanon and Syria. [The problems with returning to the
JCPOA or an enhanced agreement that addresses Iran's missile program,
for example, are similar to the one's the Obama administration
encountered, including opposition from regional allies and hawks in
Washington determined to scuttle a deal, with one additional, notable
challenge: Iran's leaders would likely be reluctant to enter an
agreement with the United States after the Trump administration breached
the JCPOA in May 2018]{.underline}. The Iranians would also resist
limits on their ballistic missiles given their reliance on those weapons
for regional deterrence. There are also constraints on the U.S. side: In
order for the Trump administration to make a new agreement work, it
would need to convince its regional allies of its wisdom. This would be
a hard sell---not only because th[e Israelis, Emiratis, and Saudis
continue to have zero trust that the Iranians would uphold their
commitments in a deal but because leaders in Jerusalem, Abu Dhabi, and
Riyadh are no longer confident that Trump would hold Tehran
accountable]{.underline} for whatever violations might occur. This is
especially the case after the Trump administration's halfhearted
response to Iran's provocations during the summer of 2019, culminating
with the attack on Saudi oil processing facilities. [A return to the
nuclear agreement or a new JCPOA would create the same dynamics as the
original deal, in which the authors and signatories have incentive to
overlook violations or other related problems, such as Iran's
irredentist approach to the region]{.underline}. [This gives other
regional powers incentive to push back on their own, thus further
destabilizing the region.]{.underline} The inadequacy of an updated and
expanded JCPOA raises the possibility of a grand bargain. In this
scenario, Iran would relinquish its nuclear capabilities for an explicit
U.S. recognition of the country's role as a regional leader and a
partner in developing the regional rules of the road. The underlying
assumption of [a grand bargain is that once Iran's demands for a seat at
the table are recognized]{.underline}, it will end its malevolent
activities around the region. It's [a tempting thought---but entirely
unrealistic, given the utter absence of trust in the
regio]{.underline}n. The safeguards that would be needed to persuade
Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates of the wisdom of such
a deal---including an end to Iran's support for allies around the
region, restrictions on its military, and a clear statement from Tehran
renouncing territorial claims on its neighbors---would render it
anathema to the Iranians, who would likely view it as little more than
regime change by another name. The United States, of course, could forgo
restrictions on Iran that would satisfy its allies and instead pressure
Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE to accept a grand bargain. But that
would not diminish the ability of U.S. allies to leverage their
political clout in Washington and make mischief regionally in an effort
to undermine a grand bargain. In other words, a grand bargain would
likely meet the same fate as the Obama administration's JCPOA or a JCPOA
2.0[. That leaves the United States with the most realistic option:
containment.]{.underline} The record over the last four decades
indicates that [the United States cannot change Iran's behavior through
either coercion or incentive. And it does not have the kind of influence
to force other countries in the region to alter their own approaches to
Iran and the broader region. Under these circumstances, anything that's
possible is better than aspirations that bear little resemblance to
reality---and what's possible is containment. Containment]{.underline},
which guided Washington in its confrontation with the Soviet Union
during the Cold War, [is a way in which the United States can restrain
Iran and its effort to undermine U.S. policies and goals in the
region]{.underline}. [The Clinton administration pursued this
policy]{.underline}---along with containment of Iraq---[with success in
the 1990]{.underline}s. Sure, there were problems with Tehran at the
time, bu[t the relationship between the United States and Iran was more
stable in that outright conflict and escalation were less
likely]{.underline}. That is because the United States and Iran
established an equilibrium of sorts in which everyone understood some
basic rules of the game that made it possible to manage crises.
[Containment requires U.S. forces in the region, and possibly the
application of violence, in order to demonstrate what is acceptable. It
is not risk-free for the United States. But the approach does reduce the
possibility of escalation because U.S. policymakers would cease to
consider regime change an option.]{.underline} With both the idea of
regime change and the necessity of defending a flawed nuclear deal taken
off the table, the stakes for the U.S.-Iranian relationship will be
demonstrably lower, thereby stabilizing Gulf. This leaves the gnarly
issue of what to do about an Iranian nuclear program unfettered by any
international agreemen[t. But containment is capable of handling any
outcome that produces. Indeed, that is precisely what U.S. policy has
been toward nuclear-armed North Korea. Nobody would argue that this has
been an ideal outcome, but it has been better than any easily
identifiable alternatives]{.underline}---and it's hard to understand why
it should be anathema when it comes to Iran. Indeed, the Gulf states are
less worried about Iranian nukes and more concerned about its desire to
extend its influence around the region. [The Israelis would eventually
need more security assistance, but that shouldn't be a deal breaker for
containment,]{.underline} given the other available policy options.
[Containment would not preclude dialogue between Iran and the United
States and may even improve it, given the way it would produce implicit
but well-understood rules for behavior.]{.underline} It would also
provide the United States some much needed diplomatic room to help
manage regional crises like Yemen, Syria, and Iraq. The Iranians are
more apt to press their advantages in these places so long as they
believe the United States might end their regime or look the other way.
Most important, [containing Iran represents the most realistic
assessment of what either U.S. or Iranian politics can
bear.]{.underline} It is not as romantic as the idea of secret meetings
in Oman or long negotiation sessions in Vienna. It lacks the bravado of
bringing down leaders of a system that has vexed, maimed, and killed
Americans. Containment is nevertheless the best option. It
simultaneously reduces the risk of war, protects Americans, and renders
the U.S. presence in the region less expensive. It would be
foreign-policy malpractice not to embrace it.

The deadlocked negotiations on Iran's nuclear program resumed in Qatar
on June 28, after European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell
visited Tehran to coax Iran back to the negotiating table. [Resuming the
nuclear talks makes sense only if the United States and its allies step
up pressure on Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons program. Otherwise,
Tehran is sure to continue its delaying tactics while pretending to take
the negotiations seriously, advancing its nuclear program, and
orchestrating proxy attacks on U.S. military forces and allies in the
Middle East. If the Biden Administration fails to adequately ratchet up
pressure on Tehran, then Iran's radical regime will become a
nuclear-armed menace that will pose much greater threats to the U.S.,
its allies, and partners and stability in the Middle East than it
already does.]{.underline} The Biden Administration's single-minded
efforts to revive the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),
also known as the Iran nuclear deal, have been stalemated by Iran's
hard-line Islamist regime, which continues to push for additional,
unwarranted concessions. Despite the Administration's eagerness to renew
the deeply flawed nuclear deal, the Vienna nuclear talks have been
suspended since March because Iran has insisted on receiving two
additional concessions that were not part of the original deal: the
lifting of U.S. terrorism-related sanctions on Iran's Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and a guarantee that the U.S. will not
withdraw from any nuclear deal again. Meanwhile, [Iran has seemingly
reduced its "breakout time" to a few weeks if not less, enriching enough
uranium to build at least one nuclear weapon---and eventually
more.]{.underline}1 Iran also continues to attack U.S. allies and U.S.
military forces in the Middle East with rockets, armed drones, and its
terrorist proxies. [It is long past time for the Biden Administration to
drop its soft-minded, soft-power diplomacy on Iran's deeply troubling
nuclear program and adopt a realistic and proactive strategy. This new
strategy should penalize and undermine Iran's outlaw regime and pressure
it to end its hostile anti-U.S. policies; at the very least, Iran must
pay a much higher price for them.]{.underline} Time for Plan B The Biden
Administration's complacent "diplomacy first" approach to Iran has
amounted to little more than "diplomacy only." [The Administration's
reliance on open-ended diplomacy using "carrots" but few "sticks" gave
Iran cover to rapidly advance its nuclear and missile programs and
orchestrate multiple attacks on U.S. forces and its allies via its
proxies]{.underline}. The Administration committed diplomatic
malpractice by abandoning the Trump Administration's "maximum pressure"
sanctions strategy, turning a blind eye to Iran's surging illicit oil
exports to China, and downplaying the possibility and utility of using
military force if Iran continues down its path to nuclear weapons. These
[self-imposed constraints enabled Iran to expand its oil exports and
foreign currency holdings while minimizing the perceived risks to Tehran
of potential military action.]{.underline} These miscalculations greatly
reduced pressure on Iran to compromise at the negotiating table on its
nuclear program. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, an ultra-hard-line
protégé of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was inaugurated last
August and is more willing than many past Iranian leaders to sacrifice
national economic interests to advance the regime's Islamist
totalitarian and regional agenda. The Raisi regime has blocked any
resolution of the nuclear issue unless the Biden Administration first
lifts its designation of the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization
and removes the economic sanctions on it.2 The IRGC controls key parts
of Iran's nuclear program, ballistic and cruise missile forces, and
armed drone arsenal, and orchestrates Iran's shadow war against the U.S.
and its allies, including Israel, often using proxy attacks by terrorist
and other militant groups.3 In addition to threatening Iran's external
enemies, the IRGC is a pillar of internal repression on which the Raisi
regime increasingly depends to control Iran's disaffected citizens,4 and
also controls up to one-third of Iran's economy,5 two more reasons that
the regime is adamant about lifting U.S. sanctions on it. [The Biden
Administration initially sought to trade the lifting of sanctions for a
public statement that Iran would not attack U.S. interests, but Tehran
balked at making even such a weak and non-binding
statement.]{.underline} Buoyed by high oil prices, which have eased the
pain of sanctions, the Raisi regime is in no hurry to reach a deal while
it fills government coffers. The regime also believes that its growing
stockpile of enriched uranium, which puts it ever closer to fielding a
nuclear weapon, gives it significant negotiating leverage and allows it
to make a litany of demands of the U.S. at the table.[6 Even if renewed
negotiations yield another nuclear agreement, which looks increasingly
unlikely, it will not be the "longer and stronger" agreement that the
Administration promised,7 but a "shorter and weaker" one that will not
address the JCPOA shortcomings]{.underline}, such as its "sunset
provisions" and failure to capture Iran's ballistic missile
program---the largest in the Middle East.8 It is long past time for the
Biden Administration to get tough on Iran to protect and advance U.S.
interests. [The Administration must bolster its diplomatic demands by
fully using all the tools of national power, including punitive economic
sanctions and military force, if necessary, to prevent Iran from
deploying a nuclear weapon.]{.underline} To address Iran's intensifying
nuclear and regional challenges, the U.S. should: Ramp up U.S. sanctions
on Iran. The Biden Administration relaxed its enforcement of sanctions
in a misguided effort to lure Tehran back into the nuclear deal. It
failed to stem the smuggling of illicit Iranian oil exports to China,
Iran's biggest customer.9 Adam Kredo, "Iranian Oil Sales to China
Skyrocket as Experts Say Biden Admin Turns Blind Eye to Sanctions
Enforcement," The Washington Free Beacon, November 2, 2021,
https://freebeacon.com/national-security/iranian-oil-sales-to-china-skyrocket-as-experts-say-biden-admin-turns-blind​-eye-to-sanctions-enforcement/
(accessed June 29, 2022).﻿ Washington should crack down on and penalize
oil-smuggling entities and Chinese firms buying the illicit oil. To
enable the vigorous enforcement of sanctions, the White House should
order the intelligence community to prioritize the gathering of
intelligence on how Iran circumvents economic sanctions. It should also
order the Departments of State and the Treasury to update their lists of
Iran's front companies and foreign enablers of sanctions busting more
frequently, and to share the lists with appropriate foreign governments
to enhance enforcement. Work with European allies to "snap back" U.N.
sanctions on Iran. The United Kingdom, France, and Germany also are part
of the 2015 nuclear agreement and can trigger the automatic reimposition
of multilateral U.N. sanctions on Iran under the JCPOA. The sanctions
snapback would further isolate Iran politically, make it pay a higher
economic price for its nuclear defiance, help to stifle Iran's
conventional military build-up, and discourage other countries from
helping Iran to evade sanctions. One of the weaknesses of the Iran deal
is that the snapback option expires in 2025, removing a major source of
leverage over Tehran. Develop, with allies, a favorable military force
posture in the Persian Gulf region to balance Iran. The Pentagon, its
allies, and partners should develop the capability in the region to
dissuade, deter, and deny (if necessary) Iranian acts of aggression.
[With U.S. military forces already stretched thin to meet global
military commitments, regional allies and partners must do more to
balance Iranian forces. In the current geopolitical environment,
burden-sharing among U.S. partners is critica]{.underline}l. [The Biden
Administration also must be prepared---in concert with allies and
partners---to take military action against Iran's nuclear program to
prevent the development and deployment of a nuclear weapon
capability.]{.underline} Strengthen the security of regional allies.
Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have been
frequently targeted by Iran and its proxy network. Through international
arms sales, the U.S. should help them to bolster their defenses against
Iranian ballistic and cruise missiles, rockets, and armed drones, with
the goal of eventually building an integrated air defense system that
also enhances the security of U.S. forces in the region. In addition to
selling more air and missile defense systems to Arab partners,
Washington should also encourage Israel to consider selling some of its
own air and missile defense systems to Arab countries that have
normalized relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords. Doing so
would strengthen a burgeoning relationship that would protect and
advance U.S. interests as well as enhance the security of U.S. troops
located in the region. Washington should also strengthen Israeli
deterrence of Iran by accelerating the sales of aerial refueling
tankers, precision-guided munitions, and bunker-buster bombs capable of
destroying Iran's fortified underground nuclear facilities and missile
bases. Expand the Abraham Accords. The Trump Administration brokered the
Abraham Accords that normalized bilateral relations between Israel and
Bahrain and between Israel and the UAE in 2020. Morocco and Sudan later
signed similar agreements to normalize relations with Israel. The Biden
Administration should strongly support the expansion of the accords to
include Saudi Arabia and other Arab states threatened by Iran.
Establishing this diplomatic framework would clear the way for expanded
Arab--Israeli security cooperation in a regional partnership to defeat
Iranian threats[. Iran Must Be Stopped, Not Appeased After complacently
allowing U.S. sanctions on Iran to be undermined and tolerating a
drumbeat of Iranian proxy attacks for almost 18 months, the Biden
Administration needs a realistic and proactive approach to defeat Iran's
nuclear, regional, and terrorist challenges.]{.underline} The United
States must hold Iran accountable for its accelerating nuclear program
and multiple proxy attacks against U.S. forces and interests.10 [It must
compel Iran's regime to pay a much higher price for those actions, or
Tehran will continue to act with impunity. And, the U.S. must develop
policies that will prevent Iran from becoming the world's tenth
nuclear-armed state.]{.underline}11 The nine states that currently
possess nuclear weapons are the U.S., Russia, China, U.K., France,
India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea. The failure to do so will
result in a nuclear-armed radical regime that will threaten the U.S.,
its allies, and partners in the Middle East and beyond, support
international terrorism, drive nuclear proliferation in the Middle East,
and destabilize the region through crisis and conflict, deeply
undermining American interests.

#### Only credible military presence deters Iran

**Singh 21** -- has a M.B.A. from Harvard University (Baker Scholar) and
a B.A. from Princeton University, and was responsible for devising and
coordinating U.S. national security policy toward the region stretching
from Morocco to Iran, with a particular emphasis on Iran's nuclear and
regional activities, 10/25/21 (Michael, "A Plan B for Iran", Foreign
Affairs,
<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2021-10-25/plan-b-iran>,
accessed 7/5/22)//jd

As a presidential candidate, Joe Biden laid out a two-part strategy
designed to constrain Iran's nuclear program. First, his administration
would propose a return to "mutual compliance" with the 2015 nuclear
agreement, which the United States left in 2018 and Iran subsequently
violated. Second, Washington would commence new negotiations with Tehran
on a "stronger, longer" accord to replace the original deal. When Biden
announced this policy, it was widely assumed that the first step would
be the easy part. President Donald Trump's "maximum pressure" sanctions
campaign, despite failing to attract support from the United States'
partners, had left Iran's economy reeling. And Tehran's violations of
the accord, however egregious, seemed designed to leave it room to
return to the nuclear agreement. But subsequent events have proved such
analysis to be overly optimistic: Iran has made impossible demands in
the negotiations to revive the nuclear deal, reportedly seeking
sanctions relief beyond that provided in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of
Action, while hesitating to commit to rolling back the nuclear
activities it has undertaken in violation of that agreement. In any
negotiation, each party compares the deal on offer with its best
alternative option. Iran's obstinacy in the talks to revive the JCPOA
that have taken place in Vienna suggest the calculation it made in
2015---that the nuclear accord was preferable to continued economic
pressure---has changed. This likely reflects the lower regard for the
2015 deal held by the hard-line government of President Ebrahim Raisi
and its brighter view of Iran's alternatives. Iran likely concluded from
the last four years that sanctions relief was not all it was cracked up
to be---both because foreign firms were reluctant to reenter Iran even
when the JCPOA was in effect and because it was so easy for the United
States to unilaterally rescind the accord in 2018. Raisi may also doubt
the Biden administration's willingness to enforce sanctions in the
absence of a deal and pin a good deal of hope on Iran's growing
relationship with China as a counterweight to U.S. economic pressure.
Stay informed. In-depth analysis delivered weekly. In other words,
Iranian officials may believe that returning to compliance with the
JCPOA is inferior to the alternatives. By developing a credible Plan B
that sharpens the consequences for Iran should it continue to rebuff
diplomatic overtures and expand its nuclear activities while
simultaneously offering Iran a diplomatic proposal that has a better
chance of outlasting his tenure in office, President Biden may be able
to change Iranian leaders' calculus. LEARNING FROM EXPERIENCE As [the
Biden administration weighs its choices, it should draw upon a long
history of U.S. policy failures and successes with Iran. The central
lesson from past diplomatic engagements is that the United States has
been least successful when relying too heavily on a single approach or
policy instrument and achieved the most when it has employed several
policy tools in conjunction with one another and acted in concert with
key partner]{.underline}s. For example, Iran's suspension of its nuclear
weapons drive in 2003 is generally seen as a result of U.S. military
pressure and European diplomacy working in concert. [The combination of
sanctions and diplomacy also produced nuclear agreements in 2013 and
2015]{.underline}---albeit ones subsequently deemed insufficient by both
Trump and Biden. The Biden administration should learn from these
experiences as it seeks to worsen Iran's alternatives to a deal. First
and foremost, [the United States must demonstrate that Iran will face
consequences for the unreasonable stance it has taken at the Vienna
talks, where it has insisted on sanctions relief well beyond that
provided in the JCPOA and on assurances that future administrations will
not again leave the deal---assurances that Biden could not provide even
if he wished to do so.]{.underline} Should Iran's obstinacy persist, the
Biden administration should enforce and expand existing economic
sanctions. D[oing so would disabuse Iranian officials of any notion that
Biden officials' past criticism of Trump's maximum pressure approach
means that sanctions will simply be permitted to weaken or lapse in the
absence of a deal.]{.underline} In order to accomplish this, the Biden
administration will need to underscore its commitment to enforcing
Trump-era sanctions on Iran and filling in the gaps of the sanctions
regime that have emerged in recent years. Foremost among these are
Iran's sales of oil to China, which increased dramatically starting in
2020 and are reportedly facilitated by deceptive maneuvers such as
transfers at sea. China's oil purchases from Iran reached nearly one
million barrels per day in March 2021, higher than any period over the
preceding two years, and Iran's global petrochemicals exports rose as
well. To their credit, U.S. officials have warned that tightened
sanctions may be coming, but concerns about Iran's reaction and
competing priorities in the fraught U.S.-Chinese relationship will
likely make it difficult to pull the trigger. Iran probably concluded
that sanctions relief was not all it was cracked up to be. Such a
decision would be easier to take, and the overall pressure on Iran would
be magnified, if the United States acts in concert with partners. In
particular, [if the so-called E3 of Germany, France, and the United
Kingdom were to join the United States in withdrawing from the JCPOA in
light of Iran's refusal to return to mutual compliance, it could lead to
the reimposition of both EU and UN sanctions]{.underline}---the
"snapback" that the Trump administration sought. T[he past several years
demonstrated that such a move may have marginal economic significance
for Iran, for the simple reason that unilateral U.S. sanctions
accomplished so much by themselve]{.underline}s. But it would
nevertheless represent an important escalation of diplomatic pressure on
Iran, as its leadership is also sensitive to the perception that it is
internationally isolated. This is why the Biden administration's pursuit
of a revival of the JCPOA may prove useful, even if its proximate
objective is not achieved. If nothing else, it serves as a demonstration
of diplomatic good faith and makes it more politically palatable for
U.S. partners in Europe and Asia to once again act in concert with
Washington. Convincing the E3 to withdraw from the Iran deal will be no
easy task. Despite the fact that the agreement is no longer honored by
either the United States or Iran, the group may fear that withdrawal
could prompt an even more destabilizing response from Iran or that it
would be sacrificing elements of the agreement that are still
operational despite the U.S.-Iranian conflict. They may also be
reluctant to act without consensus in the EU, which is also a party to
the agreement. While that last problem may prove the most difficult, the
first two are easily countered---Iran's actions already risk serious
instability, and Tehran's recent moves to curtail its cooperation with
the International Atomic Energy Agency on inspections and monitoring of
its nuclear activities mean that other elements of the JCPOA are
unlikely to be preserved in the long run. The E3's departure, on the
other hand, would signal clearly that Iran was increasingly alone in its
defiant stand and that a new agreement was needed. But the Biden
administration should also prepare for the eventuality that diplomatic
and economic pressure will not be enough to deter Iran's leadership from
its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Officials in Tehran have already
demonstrated that they are willing to permit their country to endure
severe economic hardship for the sake of nuclear advancement. As a
result, [the United States will need to send a clear message that it is
willing to go beyond sanctions and conduct a military strike as a last
resort to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.]{.underline} A
restored JCPOA would likely be scuttled if Republicans win the
presidency. The Biden administration's reluctance to do this is
understandable. Neither Democrats nor Republicans are particularly
interested in yet another military conflict in the Middle East, and the
White House likely worries that issuing threats would prompt Iran's new,
hard-line administration to refuse diplomatic engagement out of pique.
But [a credible U.S. military deterrent has three advantages worth
considering.]{.underline} First, [it would send a message to Iran that
acquiring a nuclear weapon may be not simply costly but
impossible.]{.underline} Second, [it may offer assurance to U.S.
partners in the region, such as Saudi Arabia or Israel, which may
otherwise feel compelled to act against Iran themselves or pursue their
own nuclear capabilities]{.underline}. Third, [it is almost certainly
the case that any U.S. president, regardless of party affiliation, would
consider military action if confronted with urgent and credible
intelligence that Iran had decided to dash for a nuclear weapon, given
the threat such a development would pose to U.S. national
security]{.underline}. [It is]{.underline} thus far [preferable that
Iran understand the consequences of such a decision, rather than
misperceive the risks and instigate a conflict with the United States
owing to miscalculation]{.underline}. The real challenge is how to
ensure that threats of military action are credible as the United States
executes a long-delayed strategic shift away from the Middle East and
toward Asia. [The danger Iran poses to U.S. national security is real,
b]{.underline}ut it cannot compare with the challenges presented by
increasingly aggressive nuclear-armed states such as China and Russia.
[Maintaining the credibility of U.S. threats will require continuing to
act when Iran and its proxies target American interests.]{.underline}
However, rather than accompanying U.S. responses with a surge of heavy
assets drawn from other regions, such as aircraft carriers and
long-range bombers, [the United States should work steadily to bolster
its allies' and its own ability to counter Iran's probable
responses.]{.underline} U.S. credibility will also be enhanced if
Washington affirms its commitment to the region while articulating what
American strategy in the Middle East will look like amid a greater focus
on Asia. BUILDING A BETTER NUCLEAR DEAL Devising a Plan B for Iran
should not mean abandoning diplomacy---worsening Iran's alternatives
will succeed only if a credible diplomatic proposal is also on offer.
T[he Biden administration should focus on replacing rather than reviving
the JCPOA, as the restoration of the 2015 accord is unlikely in the long
run to satisfy either the United States or Iran.]{.underline} For its
part, Tehran has already invited discussion of a completely new deal by
requesting major changes to the JCPOA that would prevent the United
States from once again withdrawing. Biden has also indicated that
negotiating a stronger deal, not merely restoring the JCPOA, is his
ultimate objective. And it seems inevitable that a restored JCPOA would
be scuttled once again should Republicans retake the White House.
Ironically, the most straightforward way for the Biden administration to
offer Iran a "better" deal may be to present it with a diplomatic
agreement that asks more of Tehran but is also able to attract
bipartisan support and is thus more sustainable. Such a deal could take
the form of a "JCPOA Plus," which would aim to expand the nuclear
restrictions on Iran and add limitations on its missile activities. The
Biden administration, as well as JCPOA critics, has also suggested that
regional issues such as Iraq or Yemen be included in these negotiations.
But Washington should think twice about negotiating these issues
bilaterally with Tehran---or, for that matter, with Moscow and Beijing.
Such matters are arguably better handled separately, with a different
set of parties engaged. Alternatively, the United States could put aside
the JCPOA and pursue an entirely different model. One option would be an
arms control--style agreement in which the obligations on both sides
expire after a set period if the deal is not superseded---an improvement
over the JCPOA, in which Iran's obligations phase out but those of the
United States and its partners never do. While adopting a new diplomatic
paradigm would hold the considerable disadvantage of discarding an
agreement that already enjoys wide international support, it would also
allow the United States and Iran to jettison the baggage that has
accompanied discussion of the JCPOA in recent years. Ultimately,
[reaching a diplomatic accord with Iran may not be strictly necessary.
If the consequences for expanding its nuclear program are sufficiently
strong and clear, it is possible that Iran could be deterred without an
agreement.]{.underline} Nevertheless, a negotiated agreement should
remain the preferred objective of U.S. policy, as a strong agreement can
reduce the instability and potential for miscalculation that relying on
containment and deterrence entails. It is becoming increasingly likely,
however, that any new agreement between the United States and Iran will
not be a revival of the JCPOA. Moving directly to the negotiation of a
new agreement will undoubtedly be fraught with risk in the short
term---but if the Biden administration takes care to build both domestic
and international support for its efforts, it could deliver a more
successful and sustainable result in the long run.

[Economic [sanctions have been successful in stopping Iran from
**pursuing their nuclear program thus far**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Iran
has conceded]{.underline}]{.mark} [multiple times to the United
States]{.underline} and the international community [[to halt]{.mark}
the **[enrichment]{.mark} of uranium** and the advancement of their
nuclear program]{.underline}. The most notable example of Iran's
concessions has been the signing of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of
Action in which Iran agreed to halt and greatly reduce their nuclear
program in return for substantial easing of economic sanctions. The
second criteria has been met as Iran's economy has significantly
worsened due to continued economic pressure from the United States and
the international community. [[Iran's economy has **significantly
worsened** due to]{.mark} **continued [economic pressure]{.mark}** from
the United States]{.underline} and the international community.
[Continued economic pressure has been **paramount** to bringing Iran to
the negotiating]{.underline} table. [While the United States and its
regional allies do pose a [military threat]{.mark} to Iran, that [is
**unlikely a sufficient factor**]{.mark} in dissuading
Iran]{.underline}.

We have established that the level of political contestation in the
targeted countries, their economic and security vulnerabilities, and the
degree of international cooperation are important factors in determining
if economic sanctions are effective at limiting nuclear proliferation.
[In Iran's case the regime, while authoritarian, allows for limited
**political contestation**.]{.underline} [The general public gets to
elect the president (even if candidates are handpicked by the supreme
leader). Iranians have been able to protest against the government. One
goal of economic sanctions is to **galvanize the general public**
against the government and their policy decisions.]{.underline}
[Iranians have indeed been frustrated by the sanctions and **voiced
their discontent** with the government policies targeted by the
sanctions]{.underline}.

[Iran's international environment is also conductive for economic
sanctions to be effective. Iran is a regional power with an impressive
arsenal of missiles and extensive network of proxy forces. Therefore,
nuclear weapons are not imperative for Iran's defence]{.underline}. On
the other end, Iran's economy is largely based on oil and gas exports.
[[**Integration** into the]{.mark} global [market is]{.mark} very
important for Iranians and [a **vital source of revenue for the
government**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Economic sanctions have hurt the
Iranian economy and therefore have **hurt Iranians**]{.underline}. [[The
**economic squeeze** has brought **Iran to the negotiating table** in
the past and **will**]{.mark} **likely [do so in the
future]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The international approach to Iran has
been encompassing with the European Union and the United Kingdom taking
a common stand with the United States in preventing Iran from acquiring
nuclear weapons. Even after the United States left the JCPOA the EU and
UK have attempted to develop mechanisms to provide Iran with economic
incentives to keep Iran abiding to the JCPOA. [Even though China has
given Iran an economic lifeline there is tension within Iran over
concerns of becoming too economically dependent on China.]{.underline}

## AT: Oil Wars

### Heg Solves Oil Wars

#### Abandoning hegemony causes middle east war- 6 reasons

**Mansoor, PhD, 20**

(Peter, retired history prof@OhioState,
<https://www.hoover.org/research/leaving-middle-east>, 3-31)

[Why have presidents of both parties, despite their stated willingness
to remove U.S. forces from the Middle East, **proven unable** to do
so?]{.underline} The fact is that [promises to reduce the
U.S.]{.underline} military [presence abroad in order to nation-build at
home sell well on the campaign trail]{.underline}, [but once in office
presidents are confronted with challenges that do not lend themselves to
**trite slogans or easy solutions**.]{.underline} [Flashy campaign
promises set the stage for **foreign policy failure, for in the Middle
East, Las Vegas rules do not apply: What happens in the Middle East does
not stay in the Middle East. Promises of retrenchment poll well, until
the realities**]{.underline} **[of migrant displacement, terrorism, and
oil shocks cause reconsideration of simplistic policies ungrounded in
Middle Eastern realities]{.underline}**. In a recent op-ed, Janan Ganesh
put the issue clearly. "The problem, I used to think, is the failure to
honour these promises of retrenchment. In truth, the promises are the
problem. [The US accumulated foreign interests over the course of the
20th century that cannot be divested at speed, at least not **without
grievous cost,**]{.underline} and at least [not in a region as
intractable as this one]{.underline}. A responsible political class
would not pretend otherwise every four years. It would gird voters for a
process of extrication that might turn out to be the work of a human
lifetime."1 [Here are six reasons]{.underline} why [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates **[must remain
engaged]{.underline}** [in the Middle East for the foreseeable
future]{.underline}. 1. [Terrorism.]{.underline} In 2011 President
Barack Obama opted to allow the Status of Forces Agreement with Iraq to
lapse, bringing home all of the U.S. forces deployed to that country.
His desire was to normalize relations, removing forces that some
believed served as an irritant to a smoother U.S.-Iraq relationship. But
[by removing U.S. forces]{.underline} from Iraq, the [Obama]{.underline}
administration [squandered the leverage those forces created for U.S.
interests in the region]{.underline}. [High among these interests was
the war against Islamist extremists]{.underline}, which did not
magically disappear with the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq. I need
not go into the subsequent rise of the Islamic State here, but suffice
it to say that Middle Eastern political and security realities intruded
on the view of the region held by some in the Obama administration. It
turned out the tide of war was not receding, at least not without
substantial investment by the United States in stabilizing troubled
areas. Now that the Islamic State has been defeated, some in the Trump
administration are all too ready to make the same mistake, believing
that the war is over and the troops can now come home. [Such hubris
ignores the history of the defeat of al-Qaeda in Iraq and the rise of
ISIS, a history that may rhyme if not exactly repeat itself absent
continued U.S. involvement in the region.]{.underline} And lest we think
that the war against the Islamic State wasn't important to our security,
I would note that since its destruction there have been no ISIS-inspired
mass murder events in the West. 2. [Iran. Retrenchment comes at a
cost]{.underline}. We can debate whether the cost is acceptable, but we
cannot ignore that there will be a cost to withdrawal from the region[.
Iran in particular desires to **establish hegemony across the Middle
East**]{.underline}, [and is likely to achieve that goal **absent U.S.
resistance.**]{.underline} We may want Saudi Arabia to assume the costs
of containing Iran, but it is unable to do so. Iran's population of 81
million dwarfs the Saudi population of 33 million. The Saudi economy is
also highly vulnerable to disruption, something the world discovered
when cruise missiles and drones damaged a facility at Abqaiq and thereby
halved Saudi oil production. 3. [Oil. A]{.underline}lthough thanks to
the fracking revolution the United States is now nearly self-sufficient
in the production of oil and natural gas, the other [major industrial
nations]{.underline} of the world still [rely on Middle Eastern oil to
fuel their economies]{.underline}. [The hydrocarbon market is global, so
any disruption to oil exportation from the Middle East will have an
impact on the availability and price of oil,]{.underline} **[which in
turn could cause economic disruption or recession]{.underline}**. [It is
convenient to say the Europeans, Chinese, or Japanese should defend
their access to Middle Eastern oil since they are more dependent on it
than the United States, **but this is a pipe dream**]{.underline}.
[Those nations would rather allow Iran to run roughshod over the Middle
East than to defend their interests there with force.]{.underline} And
do we really relish the prospect of Chinese military forces intervening
in the Gulf to ensure the flow of oil to Asia? 4. I[srael]{.underline}.
Despite the lack of a formal alliance with Israel, that state [is
America's only reliable partner in the Middle East]{.underline}. [It is
also highly vulnerable]{.underline}, surrounded by an Arab-Islamic world
that desires its destruction. [Abandonment]{.underline} by the United
States [would jeopardize its security in any number of ways that could
lead to unpredictable results, including a potential war between Israel
and Iran that would **threaten the use of nuclear weapons**]{.underline}
for the first time since 1945. 5. [Counter-proliferation. Possession of
nuclear weapons by major powers have arguably kept cold wars from
turning hot in the 75 years since the end of World War II,]{.underline}
but a [significant increase in the number of states possessing nuclear
weapons and ballistic missile technology would likely destabilize the
international security environment]{.underline}. Imagine if Iran had
nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles today; pushed to the brink by economic
sanctions, the Supreme Leader might opt at some point for a nuclear
attack against Saudi Arabia or Israel, leading to certain retaliation by
the latter. Saudi Arabia would hardly stand by as Iran acquired these
technologies; instead, it would simply purchase devices from Pakistan or
North Korea or buy the technical expertise to develop its own weapons
and delivery systems. [This is a likely scenario, but one that can be
avoided provided the United States **remains engaged** in the
region.]{.underline} 6. Refugees. [Millions of refugees have departed
their homelands in the Middle East for safer destinations.
Mo]{.underline}st of these people have settled in other Arab nations,
but around 3.5 million are in Turkey. Since 2008 more than 5 million
refugees, many of them from the Middle East, have arrived in the 28
states of the European Union, significantly destabilizing the domestic
political climate of a number of countries, including Great Britain,
France, Germany, Poland, and Hungary. [A U.S. retrenchment from the
Middle East, if it led to a war between Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Iran,
would lead to another refugee crisis.]{.underline}

#### Retrenchment causes oil wars in the middle east- Russia fills in 

**Indyk, PhD, 22**

(MARTIN INDYK is a Distinguished Fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations in New York.
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2022-02-14/price-retrenchment)

[In the past,]{.underline} [Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [would not have
hesitated, calculating]{.underline} that [responding to its American
ally]{.underline} at its moment of need [was like paying an insurance
premium]{.underline} to help guarantee that the United States would be
there to defend Saudi Arabia when necessary. But [that pact fell
apart]{.underline} in September 2019, [when Saudi oil facilities at
Abqaiq were attacked by Iranian drones]{.underline} and missiles that
knocked out 50 percent of its oil production. [Instead of rushing to
Saudi Arabia\'s defense, Trump equivocated]{.underline} and then noted
that it was an attack on Saudi Arabia and not on the United States. If
he decided to respond, Trump vowed the Saudis would have to pay for it.
[Trump's disregard]{.underline} for traditional U.S. security
commitments [compounded the doubts already raised by
Obama]{.underline}'s decision in 2013 not to enforce his own stated
redline against the Assad regime in Syria, when it used chemical weapons
against its own people. [Biden continued this trend, deemphasizing the
Middle East as he made combatting China his first priority]{.underline}.
When he ended the "forever war" in Afghanistan and brought the remaining
U.S. troops and American citizens home in a shambolic evacuation, Middle
Eastern leaders reached a common conclusion: the United States was no
longer a reliable partner in the security of the region. Because [this
**trend of U.S. retrenchment** from the Middle East]{.underline} [had
been developing]{.underline} over the last decade, and because [the
region's leaders]{.underline} are always sensitive to shifts in the
balance of power, they [have been looking around for **alternative
guarantors** of their security for some time]{.underline}. [**Russia was
quick to put up its hand**, intervening militarily in
Syria]{.underline}'s civil war in 2015 to save the regime of Bashar
al-Assad. At the time, the United States was pursuing regime change in
Egypt, Libya, and Syria. The contrast was not lost on the region's Arab
leaders: Russia had become a status quo power in the Middle East; the
United States was the one that seemed to be promoting instability. [This
did not precipitate a **headlong rush into Moscow's embrace, however**.
Memories of Soviet destabilizing behavior and the hope that a new
president in Washington might turn things around led to more cautious
explorations.]{.underline} But over time, Arab leaders have become
comfortable with a hedging strategy that involves warmer relations with
Russia. TIME TO CUT SOME SLACK [For Israelis]{.underline}, the
calculation is not that different, notwithstanding their heavy
dependence on the United States. [Their existential threat is
Iran]{.underline}. On three of Israel's four borders, Iranian proxies
are gathering strength: Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and
Iranian-controlled militias in Syria. Israel is fighting what it calls
"the war between the wars" to prevent the transfer through Syria of
Iranian advanced missiles and guidance systems to Hezbollah in Lebanon,
and to thwart attempts by Iranian-backed militias to open yet another
front with Israel, on the Golan Heights. Russia's military presence in
Syria makes it more of a player in this conflict than is the United
States, which maintains a limited force in eastern Syria, to fight the
Islamic State (or ISIS), but has left Israel to fend for itself in the
rest of the country. The only way that Israel can keep up its frequent
aerial attacks on Iranian targets in Syria is if the Russian air force
acquiesces in Israel's use of Syrian airspace. For that reason, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made ten visits to Russia between 2015
and 2020 to kiss Putin's ring, secure the Russian president's
cooperation, and make sure that Russian and Israeli air force operations
in Syria did not get in each other's way. Similarly, once Bennett became
prime minister last year, he wasted no time in reaffirming those
arrangements on a visit to the Kremlin in October 2021. In January of
this year, however, the Russian Defense Ministry announced that Russian
and Syrian jets had conducted a joint patrol over the Golan Heights and
that these patrols would continue. This was a symbolic warning shot
across Israel's bow, signaling to Jerusalem that if Putin wanted to, he
could easily put an end to Israeli military operations in Syria. If
Israel were thinking of siding publicly with the United States over
Ukraine, Moscow had just signaled that there would be a steep strategic
price to pay. Washington might have to release the Saudi crown prince
from the penalty box. U.S. allies and partners in the Middle East are
not critical to the effort to deter Russia from invading Ukraine. They
may even be willing to help on the margins: Qatar could divert gas
supplies from long-term contracts in Asia to the European spot market,
Saudi Arabia and the UAE could ease the pressure on oil prices in the
event of an invasion, and Israel can continue passing private messages
to the Kremlin, urging de-escalation. But the [public silence of all
those countries in this crisis speaks volumes about the new geopolitics
of the Middle East]{.underline}. [Russia has become a
player]{.underline} in the region, **[partially filling the vacuum left
by U.S. retrenchment.]{.underline}** And [to some]{.underline} U.S.
allies, [Moscow appears more reliable than Washington.]{.underline}
[There is no getting around this fundamental tradeoff given the reality
that a rising China and an aggressive Russia require greater U.S.
attention.]{.underline} Rather than demand that his Middle Eastern
partners and allies take a public stand, Biden is going to have to cut
them some slack. And this extends beyond pronouncements and
condemnations over Ukraine. [Washington might have to release the Saudi
crown prince from the penalty box if Biden needs MBS to reduce the price
of oil. U.S. pressure on Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to
end their war in Yemen may have to give way to support for their efforts
to deter Iranian-backed Houthi aggression.]{.underline} The United
States may have to continue giving Israel a free hand to deal with
Iran's regional subversions even as Biden reenters the nuclear agreement
with Iran. And cooperation with Egypt in Gaza and Libya may have to take
priority over U.S. demands that Sisi ease up his repression at home.
[The Ukraine crisis has spotlighted a cruel paradox for U.S. policy in
the Middle East. Even though it has downgraded its interests there,
which should have allowed for a greater assertion of American values,
the return of geopolitics is forcing the Biden administration to adopt a
new realism. Whatever good intentions the United States might have in
the region, its interests there are increasingly taking priority over
its values]{.underline}.

### No Oil Wars

#### No oil wars -- states fight for other reasons.

Over the past year, [Chinese]{.underline} seismic survey
[vessels]{.underline} and their paramilitary escorts have
[interfered]{.underline} repeatedly [with]{.underline} Vietnamese and
Malaysian **[oil]{.underline}** and natural gas
**[exploration]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline}
**[S]{.underline}**outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea,
harassing drilling rigs and support ships. These
[confrontations]{.underline} have [prompted concerns]{.underline} that
[they could provoke]{.underline} a larger **[military
conflict]{.underline}**, especially as China exploits the unsteadiness
created by the coronavirus to become more aggressive in its various
international territorial disputes. Happily, [the **historical
record**]{.underline} [indicates]{.underline} that China and its
neighbors are [unlikely to **escalate**]{.underline} their energy
sparring. [Contrary to **overheated rhetoric**]{.underline}, [countries
do not]{.underline} actually "**[take the oil]{.underline}**," to use
President Trump's controversial and inaccurate phrase. Instead, my
**[recent research]{.underline}** [demonstrates]{.underline} that
[countries **avoid fighting**]{.underline} [for oil]{.underline}
resources. No Blood for Oil [Between **1912 and 2010**]{.underline},
[countries fought **180 times**]{.underline} [over territories that
contained]{.underline}---or were believed to
contain---**[oil]{.underline}** or natural gas resources. These
conflicts ranged from brief, nonfatal border violations, like Turkish
jets entering Greek airspace, to the two world wars. [Many of these
clashes]{.underline}---including World War II, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
(1990), the U.S. invasion of Iraq (2003), the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988),
the Falklands War (1982), and the Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay
(1932-1935)---[have been described as]{.underline} classic **[oil
wars]{.underline}**: that is, severe international conflicts in which
countries fight to obtain petroleum resources. However, [a **closer
look**]{.underline} at these conflicts [reveals]{.underline} that
[**none** merits]{.underline} the classic "[**oil war**"
label]{.underline}. Although countries did fight over oil-endowed
territories, [they]{.underline} usually [fought for **other
reasons**]{.underline}, [including aspirations to]{.underline}
**[regional hegemony]{.underline}**, **[domestic
politics]{.underline}**, **[national pride]{.underline}**, [or
**contested territories'**]{.underline} other strategic, economic, or
[symbolic assets]{.underline}. [Oil was an **uncommon
trigger**]{.underline} [for international confrontations and **never
caused major conflicts**]{.underline}. On approximately 20 occasions,
over almost a century, countries engaged in minor conflicts to obtain
oil resources. However, these "**[oil spats]{.underline}**" [were
**brief**]{.underline}, mild, mostly **[nonfatal]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} generally [involved countries whose
hostility]{.underline} **[predated]{.underline}** their [resource
competition]{.underline}. **[Greece and Turkey]{.underline}** have
prosecuted oil spats. So have **[China and Vietnam]{.underline}**,
**[Guyana and Venezuela]{.underline}**, and a dozen other pairs of
countries. [These confrontations]{.underline} [inspired]{.underline}
**[aggressive rhetoric]{.underline}** while they were underway, **[but
none]{.underline}** of them ever [escalated into a **larger armed
conflict**]{.underline}. [Oil]{.underline} has periodically
[influenced]{.underline} the trajectories of major
[conflicts]{.underline} that were launched [for **other
reasons**]{.underline}. At the [end of **World War I**]{.underline},
British troops seized Mosul province in order to secure its oil
resources. Oil aspirations also motivated **[Germany's
invasion]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} the Russian
[Caucasus]{.underline} (1941-1942) and [Japan's invasion of the **Dutch
East Indies**]{.underline} (1941-1942). While the latter attack
precipitated U.S. involvement in World War II, it was also a
continuation of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945). [All of these
"**oil campaigns**]{.underline}" [were inspired by]{.underline}
aggressors' [**wartime resource needs**. Absent]{.underline} the
**[ongoing conflicts]{.underline}**, these [countries would **not have
fought**]{.underline} [for oil]{.underline}. The historical record also
reveals one "**[oil gambit]{.underline}**": [Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait]{.underline} in 1990. **[Conventional explanations]{.underline}**
for the attack [assert]{.underline} that [Saddam]{.underline} Hussein
[was]{.underline} either **[greed]{.underline}**il**[y]{.underline}**
attempting to grab his neighbor's oil resources [or]{.underline} needily
[attempting to limit]{.underline} **[Kuwait's oil output]{.underline}**
in order to raise oil prices and escape from a deepening economic crisis
caused by falling oil prices and Iraq's large debts, incurred during the
Iran-Iraq War. The [first explanation is **wrong**]{.underline}. The
[second is]{.underline} correct, but **[incomplete]{.underline}**,
[because it omits Saddam's]{.underline} **[larger motive]{.underline}**
[for aggression]{.underline}: his [fear]{.underline} [of
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. The
**[regime's records]{.underline}**, seized during the 2003 U.S.
invasion, [reveal Saddam's belief]{.underline}, nurtured since the
1970s, [that the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [was determined to **contain
Iraq**]{.underline} and remove him from power. In 1990, [this false
conviction led Saddam to assume]{.underline} that the
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [was engineering Iraq's
economic crisis by encouraging Kuwait]{.underline} and the United Arab
Emirates [to exceed their OPEC oil production quotas]{.underline} [and
refuse Iraq's r]{.underline}epeated [entreaties to cancel its war
debts]{.underline}. After his infamous meeting with U.S. Ambassador
April Glaspie failed to persuade Saddam of the United States's benign
intentions, [he concluded]{.underline} that [conquering Kuwait was his
only remaining **means of survival.**]{.underline} [Fear of]{.underline}
**[U.S. hostility]{.underline}**, [not **oil aspirations**,
prompted]{.underline} **[Iraq to invade Kuwait]{.underline}**.

#### Costs are too high- Not worth the effort 

**Meierding, PhD, 20**

(Emily; 8/2/20; Assistant Professor of National Security Affairs @ Naval
Postgraduate School; "The Exaggerated Threat of Oil Wars";
https://www.lawfareblog.com/exaggerated-threat-oil-wars#:\~:text=These%20confrontations%20have%20prompted%20concerns,its%20various%20international%20territorial%20disputes)

A Question of Value The absence of oil wars is surprising and
counterintuitive. Petroleum is an exceptionally valuable resource. It
fuels all countries' economies and militaries. Oil sales are also a
crucial revenue source for producer states. Surely, countries are
willing to fight to obtain petroleum resources. In fact, classic **[oil
wars]{.underline}** [are **extraordinarily costly**]{.underline}. A
[country that aims to seize]{.underline} [foreign oil
faces,]{.underline} first, the [costs of **invading another
country**]{.underline}. [International aggression is]{.underline}
**[destructive]{.underline}** [and **expensive**]{.underline} under the
best of circumstances. [It may also damage]{.underline} the **[oil
infrastructure]{.underline}** that [a conqueror hopes to
acquire]{.underline}. **[Next]{.underline}**, [if a conqueror plans to
exploit]{.underline} **[oil]{.underline}** resources [over the long
term, it faces]{.underline} the [costs of occupying]{.underline}
**[seized territory]{.underline}**. As the United States has learned
from its "endless wars," **[foreign occupation]{.underline}** [is
**extremely challenging**]{.underline}, even for the world's most
powerful country. Additionally, a [conqueror faces]{.underline}
**[international approbation]{.underline}** [for oil grabs]{.underline}.
[As]{.underline} **[censorious responses]{.underline}** [to
Trump's]{.underline} proposition that the United States "**[take the
oil]{.underline}**" from Syria, Iraq and Libya have
[indicated]{.underline}, seizing another country's oil is considered
reprobate behavior. [It violates]{.underline}
**[i]{.underline}**nternational **[law]{.underline}**s against plunder
[and]{.underline} materially [threatens to consolidate control
over]{.underline} **[global oil]{.underline}** resources. [As
**Iraq**]{.underline} [learned]{.underline} in 1990, other
**[countries]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} international
**[institutions]{.underline}** [respond to oil grabs with]{.underline}
**[diplomatic censure]{.underline}**, **[economic
sanctions]{.underline}** [and even **military force**]{.underline}.
**[Finally]{.underline}**, [if a conqueror manages to maintain control
over]{.underline} foreign [oil]{.underline} resources, [it may not be
able to **exploit them**]{.underline}. [Conquest **scares
off**]{.underline} the foreign **[oil companies]{.underline}** that many
[countries rely on to **finance**]{.underline} and manage [oil
production]{.underline}. [Because of]{.underline} the **[high
costs]{.underline}** [of invasion, occupation, and international
opprobrium]{.underline}, classic **[oil wars]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline} simply **[not worth the effort]{.underline}**,
[regardless of petroleum's value]{.underline}. Countries may
occasionally decide that it is worth initiating an oil spat to obtain
desired resources, especially when targeted territories are contested
and other issues are at stake. However, fighting major conflicts for oil
does not pay.

While there has been much research on the effect of valuable natural
resource extraction on a state's domestic development (e.g., the
"resource curse"), Wilson Center Fellow Jeff Colgan focuses on how
[natural resource extraction affects foreign policy]{.underline}. In
Petro-Aggression: When Oil Causes War, Colgan finds that ["petrostates"
-- countries where revenue from oil exports exceeds 10 percent of GDP --
are twice as likely to engage in inter-state conflict than
non-petrostates.]{.underline}

"[America has the unfortunate habit of getting into war with
oil-exporting states]{.underline}," said Colgan. [Understanding the
dynamics of petrostates' aggressive behavior is therefore a vital
security interest.]{.underline}

Low Risk, Little Reward

[High oil revenue]{.underline}, due to its dependability and worth,
[reduces the risk of foreign policy adventurism]{.underline}, Colgan
explained, [because it lowers the domestic political accountability of
leaders.]{.underline}

[For example, Iraq's Saddam Hussein launched an unpopular, expensive,
and bloody eight-year war with Iran from 1980-88 and lost a devastating
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.]{.underline} Despite these failures, Hussein
remained in power until the United States invaded Iraq in 2003.

Likewise, [Muammar Qaddafi involved Libya in violent clashes with Chad
in the years between 1978 and 1987, sent soldiers to Tanzania and
Uganda, and financed global terrorist networks, but remained in power
for more than 40 years.]{.underline}

Regardless of whether or not the oil sector is nationalized, [oil wealth
is often controlled by the state, which leads to clientelism and
bought-off political support]{.underline}, Colgan explained. In his
book, Colgan writes that Qaddafi was able to benefit from Libya's oil
revenue with "political autonomy that would have been difficult in
\[oil's\] absence." This wealth in turn supported his more aggressive
tendencies: Libya's military expenditures were as high as 25 percent of
total revenues in some years.

Revolutionary Leadership Key

[Not all petrostates are created equal]{.underline}, however. "[The
effect of oil does depend on domestic politics]{.underline}," Colgan
said.

Colgan analyzed militarized interstate disputes in 170 countries from
1945 to 2001. In addition to the delineation between petrostates and
non-petrostates, he also found that [leadership has a strong effect,
specifically whether a state has post-revolutionary leadership or
not.]{.underline}

Colgan defines [revolutionary leaders as leaders who "transform the
existing social, political, and economic relationships of the state by
overthrowing or rejecting the existing institutions of
society."]{.underline}

Because they tend to be more aggressive and have higher risk tolerance,
personalist, revolutionary leaders, like Muammar Qaddafi, Saddam
Hussein, Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, and Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran, "find
themselves in more crises," said David Edelstein, an associate professor
at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. As a result,
petrostates with revolutionary leaders are 3.5 times more likely
instigate aggression or conflict than non-petrostates with
non-revolutionary leaders , said Colgan.

Counter Incentives

Still, not all petrostates or even petrostates with revolutionary
leaders have gone to war.

Edelstein emphasized the role of geography in influencing a state's
behavior. For example, Iran, Iraq, and Libya are able to be more
aggressive because of weak institutions and insecurity in the region.
Hugo Chavez, however, only engaged in what Colgan referred to as a "war
of words" because Venezuela is surrounded by strong neighbors.

[Oil income also generates some incentives to avoid war "because there
is a financial opportunity cost,"]{.underline} said Colgan.

[Conflict may disrupt a petrostate's oil industry through physical
damage to oil wells and pipelines]{.underline}, and targeted sanctions
can be levied as punishment for aggressive behavior, like in the case of
Iran.

[A peace-dividend may offset the opportunity costs of a petrostate's
aggressive behavior as well]{.underline}. For example, Colgan writes in
his book that despite poor diplomatic relations between the United
States and Venezuela, the United State remains Venezuela's largest oil
importer, and, "it seems clear that oil is providing incentives for
Venezuela to avoid a total break with the United States."

Policy Implications: Know Your Petrostates

The relationship between petrostates, revolutionary leaders, and
conflict has important policy implications, Colgan said.

For example, as late as July 1990, the U.S. intelligence community
predicted that Iraq would not invade Kuwait, but on August 2, 100,000
Iraqi troops crossed the border, launching what would evolve into the
First Gulf War. Understanding earlier that a petro-revolutionary leader
like Saddam Hussein was at a higher risk to initiate conflict might have
led to a different response from United States and the international
community, Colgan suggested.

On the positive side, Colgan pointed to the possibility of better
relations with hitherto aggressive petrostates after the first wave of
revolutionary leaders is passed. For example, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
age 73, is one of the last of Iran's revolutionary leaders. As he and
other leaders from the 1979 revolution are gradually replaced, Iran may
become less tolerant of risk and therefore less aggressive.

[Colgan also recommended that policymakers increase transparency in the
oil industry and reevaluate how it is governed.]{.underline} "We need to
provide more support for anti-resource curse initiatives," he said, like
the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and Cardin-Lugar
amendment of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. The Cardin-Lugar amendment
requires American oil, gas, and mineral companies to report all taxes
and expenditures paid to foreign countries. Human rights groups
applauded the requirement , but it faced heavy opposition from industry,
and the Securities and Exchange Commission only put the rule into effect
last August.

"[Efforts to manage the resource curse, by putting in place
institutions, norms, and practices to better manage the inflow of oil
income and enhance domestic political accountability, are in everyone's
interest]{.underline}," Colgan concludes in his book.

"It would be wise of the United States to end its dependence on foreign
oil," Edelstein concluded. "A world of revolutionary petrostates is a
dangerous world, but thanks to Jeff, it is a devil we know."

For decades, [[U.S.]{.mark} policymakers]{.underline} [failed to
understand]{.underline} the full meaning of **[energy
[independence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Their definition]{.underline}
[[**centered** on]{.underline}]{.mark} the need for a self-sufficient
supply of [cheap **[oil]{.mark} and gas**]{.underline}. That
understanding was [so dominant]{.underline} [it became a]{.underline}
[matter of **national security**]{.underline}---eclipsing nearly all
other environmental considerations. U.S. President Joe Biden is making a
different bet. Biden realizes two things. First, [climate
change]{.underline} [is its own national]{.underline} [security
threat]{.underline}; second, [[real]{.mark} energy
[independence]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[now means]{.mark}**
securing]{.underline} the resources and ideas needed for
**[[21st-century]{.mark} energy
[tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}**---among other things, [solar
panels]{.underline}, [rare-earth metals]{.underline},
[batteries]{.underline}, [and wind turbines]{.underline}. Yet although
the **[Biden]{.underline}** administration has made great strides
forward with this acknowledgment, its [climate strategy]{.underline}
**[has room to grow]{.underline}**. [As [climate]{.mark} change
continues to]{.underline} **[[destabilize]{.mark} at-risk
[regions]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[worldwide]{.underline}]{.mark},
[threatening to **[draw]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[into]{.mark}**]{.underline} more [protracted]{.underline},
**[international [conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [the
administration]{.underline} [needs to do more]{.underline} to treat
climate change as a matter of national security rather than as just an
environmental concern---and to move toward true energy independence in
the process.

For [[too long]{.underline}]{.mark}, [policymakers thought]{.underline}
the **[[oil]{.mark} and gas]{.underline}** industry [[was the
**key**]{.mark} **to energy independence**]{.underline}.
[They]{.underline} [gave]{.underline} the industry [special
treatment]{.underline}, [allowing it to operate]{.underline}
[with **minimal environmental restrictions**]{.underline} in an effort
[to boost the economy]{.underline} [and unshackle]{.underline} the
country from its [reliance on foreign hydrocarbons]{.underline}. From
one perspective, [that made sense]{.underline}: The [oil and
gas]{.underline} [boom]{.underline} that began in the early 2000s, [with
the advent of]{.underline} hydraulic fracturing (or
**[fracking]{.underline}**), [made the United States]{.underline} [the
**largest oil producer**]{.underline} in the world. It [provided
a]{.underline}
significant [[windfall](https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/research/papers/2017/wp1708.pdf) to
the economy]{.underline} [and enabled]{.underline} [the country
to]{.underline} **[cut its reliance]{.underline}** [on foreign oil and
gas]{.underline} [in half](https://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/data.php).

[However]{.underline}, **[[this]{.mark} traditional]{.underline}**
promotion---and **[[conception]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[of energy
independence]{.underline} [[ignored]{.underline}]{.mark} the pressing
issue of **[[climate]{.mark} change]{.underline}**. [The [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} [**[[failed](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/) to]{.mark}
effectively [diversify]{.mark}** its energy portfolio]{.underline}, [and
now]{.underline}, [it [lags behind]{.mark}]{.underline} [other
nations]{.underline} [[in **renewables**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[This]{.underline} [oversight has become]{.underline} [a
liability]{.underline}. [Other countries]{.underline} [are]{.underline}
outright [refusing to buy]{.underline} [U.S. natural gas]{.underline}
for being "too dirty"; [carbon]{.underline} border adjustments, or
[tariffs]{.underline} on products with high carbon
emissions, [[threaten](https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/544230-administrations-messaging-on-carbon-border-adjustments) to
**disrupt the competitive advantage**]{.underline} [U.S.-made products
have]{.underline}; and now, [sourcing the materials]{.underline} from
abroad [to build **renewables**]{.underline} [has
become [trickier](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/05/21/china-raises-threat-of-rare-earth-mineral-cutoff-to-us/)]{.underline} than
it was before.

As hydrocarbons become less of a geopolitical priority, [the meaning
of]{.underline} "**[energy independence]{.underline}**" [is
changing]{.underline}---in ways that have [made it hard for
the]{.underline} [United States to keep up]{.underline}. [[It's]{.mark}
**no longer**]{.underline} [measured by **oil** extraction]{.underline},
[but by]{.underline} [[new]{.underline}]{.mark}, [low-carbon energy
technologies]{.underline}, such as **[[solar]{.mark}
panels]{.underline}**, **[[wind]{.mark} turbines]{.underline}**,
**[electric vehicles]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} even
**[responsibly sourced natural gas]{.underline}**. [China has
the]{.underline} [power to influence]{.underline} [U.S. energy
production]{.underline}, [defense technologies]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} other [industries]{.underline}. Although
[U.S.]{.underline} policymakers dithered for the past 30 years, the
country [continued to lag behind]{.underline} [the competition
for]{.underline} these [newer technologies]{.underline} [and
the]{.underline} [critical minerals needed]{.underline} to build them.
And [**[China]{.mark} has [rushed ahead]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[It's]{.underline} now
[[responsible](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/solar-pv-module-shipments-by-country-of-origin-2012-2019)
for]{.underline} more than [half of the world's]{.underline} [solar
panel]{.underline} module [exports]{.underline}, [and it
[controls](https://about.bnef.com/blog/china-dominates-the-lithium-ion-battery-supply-chain-but-europe-is-on-the-rise/)]{.underline},
for instance, [80 percent of]{.underline} the world's [**battery
material** refining]{.underline} and 77 percent of the world's battery
cell capacity. By now, Washington relies on other nations---especially
China---for the critical mineral imports needed to build everything from
electric vehicles to solar panels and wind turbines. Limitations on
these minerals can make it harder to adopt low-carbon technologies and
can leave Washington vulnerable to the whims and desires of those
nations. China, essentially, has the power to influence U.S. energy
production, defense technologies, and other industries that rely on the
same critical materials.

Meanwhile, as the United States continues to be the second largest
contributor of greenhouse gas emissions, climate change has amplified
everything from humanitarian crises that drag Washington into protracted
foreign conflicts to the growth of terrorist organizations that threaten
domestic security. According to the [Climate Impact
Lab](http://www.impactlab.org/map/#usmeas=change-from-hist&usyear=2080-2099&gmeas=absolute&gyear=1986-2005&usvar=mortality),
some nations, including Iraq, Pakistan, and Syria, could see more than a
20 percent reduction in their GDPs by 2090 due to climate change as they
face deaths from heat waves, famines, floods, and crumpling
infrastructure from storms and rising sea levels. The
[destruction]{.underline} wrought by these changes [can be a
[catalyst]{.mark}]{.underline} [[for]{.mark} **humanitarian
[crises]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[genocide]{.underline}**, [[and
**terrorism**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For instance,
[**[competition]{.underline}** [over]{.underline}]{.mark} [depleting
**[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline} [can worsen **regional
fighting**]{.underline}, as it did in 1994 when arable **[land
shortages]{.underline}** [contributed to]{.underline} the genocide in
[Rwanda]{.underline}. It can also **[[spark

[linked](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/3241) to]{.underline} the
nation's [protests and]{.underline} subsequent

is]{.mark} increasingly]{.underline} [[difficult for
Washington]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to stay out]{.mark} of]{.underline}
**[international conflicts]{.underline}**---either because they pose a

that it is complacent in the face of international travesties, as it was

[Applying **pressure** is something the West knows how to
do.]{.underline} During the George W. Bush administration, when the [US
deployed a huge number of troops into next-door Iraq, fear of an
American **military invasion** compelled the Iranians to suspend their
nuclear weaponization program. And the application of massive economic
pressure by the US and its European partners during the early years of
the Obama administration is what forced the mullahs to the bargaining
table and eventually into the original JCPOA.]{.underline} Israel's
security professionals believe now is the time to return to a policy of
pressure. [Only if Iran's leaders truly believe that something more
valuable is at risk than the nuclear program---namely, the very
stability of the regime---will they be open to compromise.]{.underline}
This can only be achieved if [America can instill a sense of fear in
Iran.]{.underline} This requires [American contingency planning and
**military training operations** to **convince Iran** that the US
commitment to act militarily to prevent its nuclear progress is real. At
the same time, a policy of pressure would include reinvigorated
**sanctions**, especially in the fields of energy and
finance.]{.underline} This has to include a willingness to target
Chinese purchases of Iranian oil, which may run counter to the
short-term desire to tamp down gasoline prices but is necessary to
convince Iran that the cost of its nuclear brinkmanship will not be
tolerated. And a policy of pressure would require extensive
coordination---political, military, economic and diplomatic---with a
wide array of countries. These need to include traditional allies and
partners in Europe and the Middle East as well as the ring of countries
that surround Iran---Turkey, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan,
even Afghanistan---that control the land bridges to the Islamic Republic
and whose assistance in enforcing sanctions can make a huge difference.
Admittedly, this is a tall order. A policy of pressure on Iran is
dramatically different from the one adopted so far by the Biden
Administration, which hoped that benign diplomacy would push the Iran
problem down the road. At a time when the world is focused on Russia's
war against Ukraine, rising anxiety over Chinese ambitions in the
Pacific, and deepening fear of a global recession, it will be tough to
convince the White House to invest the time, resources and energy to
orchestrate this complex and potentially risky initiative. But one thing
the advocates of a pressure policy have in their favor is that staying
the course---[letting Iran proceed on its current path---is bound to be
worse for US interests. If America doesn't get its hands dirty now with
**restoring deterrence** to its relationship with Iran, the Tehran
leadership may decide to move forward to 90 percent enrichment, at which
point Iran becomes a nuclear threshold state.]{.underline} Without
American action before then, Israel will feel isolated, alone and
compelled to consider measures to prevent what it would view as a
strategic catastrophe, measures whose reverberations no one can
confidently predict. All Israelis, regardless of their politics, hope
America leads the world in preventing the Iran nuclear problem from
crossing that dangerous line.

I. The Critical Importance of U.S. Alliances Let me begin, however, by
pointing out the obvious. It is, I would argue, very clear that the
[United States' alliance relationships -- both in Europe, centered upon
the NATO Alliance, and in the Indo-Pacific through multiple bilateral
alliances -- are extremely important to U.S. national security, and to
international peace and security more broadly.]{.underline} Indeed, I
would contend that alliance relationships are perhaps more important to
America today than at any time since the end of the Cold War. The United
States, after all, does not now stand astride the world as a global
"hyperpower" in the way that it did a generation ago, and we cannot
alone meet all the challenges we face from revisionist great power
competitors who seek to diminish, destabilize, and supplant us -- and
whose increasingly aggressive agendas are proving ever more dangerous to
the free and open international order upon which global peace and
prosperity have depended for a very long time. To succeed against these
challenges, it is necessary to work with others, and this requires
careful attention to our alliances and partnerships. Our alliance
relationships have been critical bulwarks of international peace and
security for many decades. Established most fundamentally to deter
aggression, the United States' alliances have so far succeeded
brilliantly in this task. Anchored in U.S. military power -- in both our
conventional strength and in the "extended" nuclear deterrence
guarantees we have long offered military allies -- these alliances faced
down threats from the Soviet Empire in both Europe and Asia throughout
the Cold War; they continue to deter belligerence by a resurgent Russia
in more recent years; and they have protected East Asia from
intimidation and aggression from the People's Republic of China and from
North Korea all the while. And U.S. alliances have done even more for
international peace and security than just deter aggression by
militarized authoritarian states. [**America's alliances** have also
proven to be the world's most **effective and successful
nonproliferation** tools.]{.underline} [They have not merely deterred
would-be aggressors, but they have also provided reassurance to those
who might otherwise fear being the victims of such aggression -- thus
**reducing the incentives** that such threatened states would otherwise
have felt to pursue the development of nuclear weaponry.]{.underline}
[It is actually quite **striking** how many of the countries the U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) once identified as being most likely
to develop nuclear weapons in the postwar era ended up not doing so as a
result of their relationships with the United States.]{.underline}
Specifically, as I pointed out in a speech I gave in my previous job,
the growth and institutionalization of [America's postwar alliance
networks and other security relationships helped both **persuade** these
countries that they did not need nuclear weaponry -- because their
existential security needs could be met through collective security,
backed by U.S. conventional military power and nuclear weapons -- and
give Washington leverage over them that we used to insist that several
nascent nuclear weapons development efforts be
**terminated.**]{.underline} In fact, I'd be willing to wager that [U.S.
alliance and security relationships are actually responsible for
shutting down **more previously** active nuclear weapons development
programs even than was the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons (NPT) itself.]{.underline} As declassified memoranda from the
late 1960s have documented, [even the Soviets eventually came to
appreciate the nonproliferation benefit of U.S. alliances during the
negotiation of the NPT, agreeing to accept an understanding of that
Treaty that would permit NATO to continue with its arrangements for
coordinating deployment of U.S.-controlled nuclear weapons as a means
not only to deter the Warsaw Pact but also to prevent access by
additional NATO allies to such devices. All in all, between deterring
World War III and preventing a long-anticipated "cascade" of nuclear
weaponization, we clearly have enormously compelling reasons to be
**grateful** to U.S. alliance relationships.]{.underline}

#### Retrenchment [causes]{.underline} Russia-Europe-invasion.

Europe is characterized by profound, continent-wide divergences across
national defense policies, particularly threat perceptions, as well as
by a fundamental defense capacity shortfall that cannot be closed
anytime soon because of a series of overlapping challenges. [Given the
combination of strategic cacophony and capacity gaps, which are mutually
reinforcing, Europeans are currently not in a position to autonomously
mount a credible deterrent and defense against Russia. This situation
would likely continue for a very long time, even if there were a
complete U.S. withdrawal from the continent, and all the more so in the
event of a partial U.S. withdrawal, a much more likely counterfactual.
If a U.S. pullback were to occur, it would leave Europe increasingly
vulnerable to Russian aggression and meddling, allowing Russia to
exploit Europe\'s centrifugal dynamics to augment its influence. A U.S.
withdrawal would also likely make institutionalized intra-European
defense cooperation appreciably harder. Accordingly, a U.S. pullback
would have grave consequences for peace and stability on the
continent.]{.underline}

These findings have major implications for both sides of the Atlantic.
In Europe, scholars and policymakers need to be realistic. The strong
desire for strategic autonomy is justified and understandable, but it is
necessary to discern between distant hopes and present realities.
Ultimately, [the barriers to strategic autonomy are so substantial that
the achievement of this goal would require a long-term, sustained and
coordinated effort.]{.underline} Sound European defense policymaking
needs to reflect this: working under an unrealistic assumption that
Europeans can quickly achieve strategic autonomy is both unwarranted and
unwise. Pursuing unrealistic goals can, in fact, undermine the
achievement of realistic ones. Instead, Eur[opean policymakers should
focus on a manageable, affordable set of initiatives for augmenting
military capacity in the short term that the United States would see as
valuable---and thus would help consolidate the transatlantic
alliance---but that would nevertheless also prove useful if the United
States does someday pull back.]{.underline} Such an approach could
gradually and cumulatively create the foundations for greater
commonality and cooperation in the future and, over time, help mitigate
the centrifugal dynamics at play in Europe.

In the United States, restraint scholars---virtually all of whom are
self-described realists---also need to be realistic. Far from portraying
the world as it is, their assessment of Europe is guided by an unfounded
optimism that Europeans can easily balance Russia if the United States
pulled out. Currently, [Europe is presented by restraint scholars as the
"easy" case for a U.S. withdrawal]{.underline}, with Asia being the
"hard" case.169 Although China is rising fast and already has much more
latent power than [Russia]{.underline}, the latter [is a greater threat
to the United States\' European allies than the former based on the
other three components of the balance of threat: geographic location,
offensive military capabilities, and aggressive
intentions.]{.underline}170 The assessment of restraint scholars that
pulling back from Europe is an easy call ultimately rests on a wholly
unsubstantiated assumption: that an effective European balancing
coalition would emerge quickly if the United States pulled back. What
our analysis shows is that Europeans would for a very long time be
unable to effectively confront Russia on their own if the United States
were to withdraw, and thus if America does want stability in Europe, it
should retain a presence on the continent.

To be clear, this analysis does not mean that the United States should
never pull back from Europe: in an ideal world, Europeans would and
should develop the institutional and material capacity to defend
themselves without needing to rely on the United States. But [until
Europeans can come together effectively in the political and foreign
policy realms---a process that will take a very long time to emerge---it
is important to be realistic and recognize that a U.S. departure would
be destabilizing.]{.underline}

European Defense Capacity Shortfall

European national assessments thus diverge profoundly regarding the
prioritization among different threats. Significantly, [Europe\'s
strategic cacophony greatly exacerbates a second overarching constraint
on Europe achieving strategic autonomy: severe military capacity gaps
that cannot be closed anytime soon.]{.underline}

[Since the end of the Cold War, Europe\'s defense capacity has markedly
decreased]{.underline}.88 Operationally, the 2011 European military
action in Libya revealed a severe shortage of key enablers for offensive
military operations: [the United States had to provide critical
capabilities that the Europeans otherwise lacked, such as air-to-air
refueling; suppression of enemy air defenses; and intelligence, target
acquisition, and reconnaissance.]{.underline}89 Indeed, a recent
systematic study by the International Institute for Strategic Studies
([IISS]{.underline}) [and the German Council on Foreign Relations found
that]{.underline}, because their capability shortfalls are so
significant, [Europeans would struggle to autonomously undertake
operations even at the low end of the spectrum of conflict]{.underline}
(such as peace enforcement missions).90

In this section, we focus on Europeans\' capacity for conventional
warfare because it is indispensable for defense and deterrence vis-à-vis
Russia and because this allows us to directly address the argument of
restraint scholars who maintain that the Europeans could autonomously
balance Russia with ease. [We identify four major challenges that are
likely to hinder the capacity of Europeans to develop an autonomous
conventional defense capacity.]{.underline}

[Lack of weapon systems for conventional deterrence and
defense]{.underline}

During the Cold War, Europeans invested heavily in the kind of
conventional capabilities required for conventional deterrence and
defense. But [after the Cold War, European defense spending plummeted,
and a great proportion of these limited resources were directed toward
out-of-area operations.]{.underline}91 As a result, Europeans are
lacking in even the most basic conventional deterrence and defense
capabilities. A key reason for this situation is Europe\'s strategic
cacophony. The five economically largest European countries---the UK,
France, Germany, Spain, and Italy---are all located in Western or
Southern Europe, which collectively have greatly de-emphasized the
territorial defense mission since the end of the Cold War. In contrast,
states in Central and Northern Europe have tended to focus relatively
more on territorial defense, especially after Russia\'s 2014 invasion of
Crimea; yet, these parts of Europe contain only small to medium-sized
countries.92

Until now, there has been no long-term examination of the year-to-year
shift across all of Europe of the kinds of core capabilities needed for
conventional deterrence and defense. To address this gap, [we
systematically gathered data from the IISS Military Balance for the
1990--2020 period on three core military systems for conventional
warfare: main battle tanks (MBTs), armored personnel carriers (APCs),
and artillery.]{.underline} To be sure, conventional warfare requires
more than simply land capabilities. Yet, Russia\'s A2/AD capacity is
aimed at eroding, or nullifying, NATO\'s local control of its airspace,
thus compelling NATO forces, in the case of conflict, to operate in an
environment of land warfare with contested air support.93 In this
context, land resistance---and thus land capabilities---become key,
which is why we focus on these three specific systems (they constitute a
sample of the needed land warfare capabilities). The data for MBTs of
Europe\'s major powers are displayed in figure 1.94 (Online appendix C
shows the data on MBTs of medium and smaller European countries as well
as the data for APCs and artillery for all European countries.)

[These data underscore the marked decline of European conventional
warfare capabilities in the past three decades.]{.underline} From 1990
to 2020, the combined European total number of MBTs plunged by 85
percent; APCs fell by 64 percent; and artillery declined by 56 percent.
As Sven Biscop concludes, "[Europe\'s capability shortfalls are such
that it can neither meet its NATO obligations for territorial defense,
nor achieve strategic autonomy with regard to the protection of
Europe]{.underline}."95

In reality, [the situation is even worse than these data indicate,
because most European militaries have significant readiness
deficiencies.]{.underline} For example, an analysis by the German
Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces concluded in 2018 that
the "readiness of the Bundeswehr\'s major weapons systems is
dramatically low in many areas,"96 noting that only 39 percent of
[Germany\'s Leopard 2 battle tanks were available for use given a lack
of spare parts; the operability of only a quarter of its PUMA infantry
combat vehicles; the nonavailability of any of its six submarines; and
the ability of less than half of its Eurofighters and Tornado combat
aircraft to fly.]{.underline}97 Significantly, [Europe\'s readiness
problems]{.underline}, such as the obsolescence of its MBTs, [are
projected to become even more challenging in the decades
ahead.]{.underline}98

[the complexity of employing modern weapons systems]{.underline}

As dramatic as these weapons shortfalls are, European defense
spending---if allocated properly---could eventually secure the needed
systems. Yet, [not only is the efficient allocation of resources a major
challenge because of Europe\'s strategic cacophony]{.underline} (as
detailed below), [but securing the needed weapons systems would only be
the first step.]{.underline}

[The effective employment of modern weapons systems is far more
challenging than in past eras for a variety of reasons]{.underline}. A
key consideration is the immense premium put on command, control,
communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (C4ISR). [C4ISR---often referred to as the "nervous
system" of modern militaries---is crucial for gathering information
about the combatants, for effectively processing that information, and
for disseminating and using that information to develop and implement
complex plans.]{.underline}99 NATO\'s 2011 mission in Libya shows the
heavy reliance of Europeans on the United States\' C4ISR capacity.
[Europeans would therefore need to develop their own C4ISR capacity to
be able to autonomously balance Russia, which would not be an easy
undertaking]{.underline} given that Russia is no Libya. [They would need
large amounts of new C4ISR systems]{.underline} (e.g., reconnaissance
and communication satellites; early warning and control aircraft; sensor
systems; air, naval, and land command and control platforms), the most
complex of which have very long development times. Notably, the already
significant difficulty of Europeans assembling the needed systems would
be made even more acute if the UK\'s exit from the EU ends up meaning
that British capabilities also need to be replaced: at present, the UK
detains, among other capabilities, 53 percent of the EU\'s combat
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance heavy unmanned aerial
vehicles (CISR UAVs), 42 percent of airborne early warning and control
aircraft, and 38 percent of electronic-intelligence aircraft.100

In addition, [European countries lack the kind of specialized personnel
needed to operate modern weapons systems effectively.]{.underline}
Redressing this weakness would be a significant undertaking, as they
have reduced their number of military personnel drastically since the
end of the Cold War. As figure 2 shows, [the size of the total active
militaries of the large European powers declined by 57 percent during
the 1990--2020 period]{.underline}.101 Furthermore, beyond the
difficulty of securing the financial resources to pay the needed
personnel, recruiting sufficient specialized personnel would be a major
challenge, as demonstrated by the difficulties faced by many European
militaries in attracting personnel for skilled positions.102 Notably, [a
recent study has shown that the employment of advanced weaponry calls
for highly skilled and highly trained military personnel, which are now
more difficult to recruit and retain in the military.]{.underline}103
Obtaining specialized military personnel to operate modern weaponry is
only the beginning; they must also be trained to effectively use modern
weapons, which is extremely challenging and time consuming, partially
because these weapons need to be used as part of a cohesive package that
places a premium not just on information gathering, but also on
coordination and delegation.104 [It has taken U.S. military personnel an
extraordinarily long time to develop the skills required for effectively
using today\'s weapons systems]{.underline}: as Posen stresses, the
United States\' "development of new weapons and tactics depends on
decades of expensively accumulated technological and tactical
experience."105 [It would likely take Europeans even longer to develop
the needed skills, given differences across countries regarding
operational cultures, levels of ambition, languages, and so
on]{.underline}.106

Finally, [the effective use of modern weaponry in the European theater
depends on European forces being able to move quickly and securely over
large distances within Europe. Yet,]{.underline} as a UK parliamentary
report puts it, ["NATO has difficulty moving large forces" across
Europe.]{.underline}107 In recent years, the Europeans have sought to
bolster military mobility through a variety of initiatives dispersed
across different institutions (within both the EU and NATO).108 Yet,
[the movement and training of military personnel and assets in Europe
remain severely hampered by a combination of capability shortfalls,
legal/procedural hurdles, and infrastructural deficiencies that will not
be easy to resolve.]{.underline}109

[the difficulty of institutionalized military cooperation]{.underline}

An additional challenge is institutional. [Europe\'s strategic cacophony
has prevented Europeans from developing an autonomous,
military-planning, command and control (C2) structure.]{.underline}110
Indeed, a report by the European Parliamentary Research Service explains
that [one of the greatest challenges of European defense is "the lack of
integration of the military structures of the Member
States."]{.underline}111 Although an effective and autonomous European
defense would require the creation of a permanent planning and C2
infrastructure, the question of developing an autonomous [Operational
Headquarters (OHQ)]{.underline} has proven highly divisive.112 [An OHQ
was never established because of conflicting national interests and
priorities among Europeans, in particular France, Germany and the
UK.]{.underline} Whereas Paris has long supported the establishment of a
military OHQ to bolster the EU\'s strategic and operational planning
structures and its contingency planning and C2 capacity, London has
strongly resisted, seeing it as a duplication of NATO\'s assets. Germany
has stood somewhat in between, though closer to the UK, favoring a focus
on civilian-military planning and C2, not least to avoid duplicating
structures already existing at NATO.113 [As a result, the EU remains
entirely dependent on NATO or national assets for the planning and
conduct of major executive operations, for which it has no autonomous
military structures.]{.underline}114

[If the United States were to pull back from Europe, it remains to be
seen whether the Europeans could rely on a "Europeanized" NATO, in which
the integrated structures would stay in place but without the United
States.]{.underline}115 Military planning and C2 require a clear chain
of command. [When NATO was created, Europeans agreed to be under U.S.
military command, rather than attempting the far more difficult task of
agreeing to be under the command of another European country or group of
European states.]{.underline} More generally, [as the hegemonic power in
NATO, the United States has facilitated institutionalized cooperation
among Europeans and helped partly contain Europe\'s strategic
cacophony.]{.underline}116 For decades, [a U.S.-led NATO has been the
overarching shaper of national defense policies and military
transformation in Europe, helping overcome coordination and
collective-action problems.]{.underline}117 In light of Europe\'s
deep-seated strategic divisions, [a U.S. disengagement would amplify
these coordination and collective action problems (assuming NATO
survived) and would further hinder institutionalized, intra-European
defense cooperation at all levels: strategies and doctrines; training;
operational learning; interoperability; and joint capability
development.]{.underline} Likewise, without the United States, the
persistent and profound divergence of threat perceptions and strategic
priorities among Europeans is likely to impede their capacity to agree
on shared C2 structures for conducting operations, except for the lowest
end of the spectrum of conflict (e.g., peace support operations).118

As a result of strategic cacophony, the EU has, in fact, struggled
mightily to create even the most minimal C2 structure. As Luis Simón
underscores, "It has taken nearly 20 years of allegedly significant
steps for the European Union to establish a 'Military Planning and
Conduct Capability' composed of up to 25 staffers, devoted to assisting
with the planning and conduct of so-called non-executive (i.e., training
and assistance) missions," with an advisory role only.119 Ultimately,
given Europe\'s deep-seated divergences, there is no basis for optimism
that Europeans will be able to agree being under the permanent command
of another European country for deterrence and defense or to
consistently undertake effective institutionalized military cooperation
without the enabling role played by the United States within NATO.

[the fragmentation of europe\'s defense industrial base]{.underline}

[If Europeans want to be strategically autonomous, they will have to
produce the defense systems they need without being reliant on the
United States. The entrenched fragmentation of Europe\' defense
industrial base, however, would make this a daunting task.]{.underline}

On the demand side, [European states have consistently privileged
domestically procured defense equipment over European arms
cooperation]{.underline}. According to data from the European Defense
Agency, from 2006 to 2015, collaborative defense procurement in Europe
accounted for less than one quarter of total procurement.120 For
example, a mere 7 percent of the European surface vessels currently in
use have been built through European armament cooperation.121 As for
fighter aircraft---[where the economic incentives for European-wide
collaboration are especially powerful given the immense cost and
complexity of these systems---there has been relatively limited defense
cooperation: less than a third (32.6 percent) of combat aircraft used by
EU militaries come from European collaborative
production.]{.underline}122 Similarly, European states spend more than
80 percent of their military research-and-development budgets within
national borders.123

conventional defense and deterrence. As Michael Kofman and Richard
Connolly convincingly argue, ["Russian military expenditure is
considerably higher" than commonly estimated.]{.underline}142 Of key
importance, they stress, is that Russia gets a lot for what it spends on
its military: it pays its soldiers a pittance in rubles, and, even more
important, it buys its weapons from its own defense contractors in
rubles, not dollars. Moreover, the Russian government has squeezed
profits in the defense sector, making the weapons it buys artificially
cheap. Notably, Russia\'s unusually high capacity to produce advanced
weaponry using domestic resources is a legacy of the Soviet Union\'s
massive level of defense production during the Cold War. Ultimately,
Kofman and Connolly maintain that, [because Russia\'s rubles can
purchase so much military power so cheaply, it is inappropriate to use
market exchange-based estimates of its military spending.]{.underline}
Based upon purchasing power parity exchange rates, "[Russia\'s effective
military expenditure actually ranged between \$150 billion and \$180
billion annually]{.underline}" (from 2015 to 2019), and "taking into
account hidden or obfuscated military expenditure, [Russia may well come
in at around \$200 billion]{.underline}."143 [Given this understanding,
Russian military spending likely exceeds the combined levels of defense
expenditures of the three major European powers]{.underline} (France,
Germany, and the UK).

[High levels of military spending have, in turn, spurred significant
modernization and expansion of Russia\'s military forces, particularly
in the 2010s]{.underline}.144 The Russian Federation is the descendent
state of the Soviet Union, which created a formidable military
industrial base with a huge cadre of highly trained personnel, providing
a strong foundation for Russia\'s current military infrastructure.
Although the Russian armed forces still display important weaknesses in
areas such as surface shipbuilding, in the past decade Moscow has
substantially "[modernized its armed forces through a massive
introduction of new and modernized weapons and infrastructure,
accompanied by radical structural changes in the military organization,
evolving modes of operation and a sharply increased number, scale and
complexity of military training and exercise]{.underline}."145 Of
particular note, from 2015 to 2019, Russia\'s army increased in size by
almost 25 percent.146 (In online appendix D, we measure the military
capabilities of Russia and four potential European balancing coalitions
regarding two overall indicators of military personnel \[total active
and total reserves\] and three core weapon systems for conventional
warfare \[main battle tanks, artillery, and armored personnel
carriers\]. Across all five of these measures, the data show that Russia
possesses a very substantial military superiority as compared to all
four potential European balancing coalitions.)

Additionally, [Russia possesses substantial C4ISR capabilities for
employing weapons systems in a coordinated manner and for managing
military operations. These capabilities are the combined result of
legacy Soviet systems and of the Kremlin\'s ongoing military
modernization effort.]{.underline}147 [Especially in the past decade,
Russia has developed a more modular, flexible force structure with an
emphasis on joint forces through a large-scale military
modernization]{.underline}.148

Military satellites are a useful indicator for understanding why
Europeans would have difficulty building up the necessary C4ISR
infrastructure for balancing Russia. For one, military satellites are
critical, because they enable the rest of the C4ISR architecture to
operate effectively by facilitating the flow of informational inputs.
Specifically, military satellites are crucial for communications,
navigation, early warning, attack assessment, and surveillance and
reconnaissance---and thus are key for pooling and employing military
power. Other C4ISR systems, such as ISR UAVs and airborne early warning
and control systems constitute more specific components of a C4ISR
architecture that play particular roles therein. Furthermore, whereas
full comparison data are available for military satellites, existing
databases do not list other C4ISR capabilities systematically. The
profound gap between Russia and European countries in military
satellites is shown in table 2.

To be sure, notwithstanding such quantitative preponderance in military
satellites, one challenge faced by the Russian military in past decades
has been the integration of highly interoperable systems for
network-centric warfare.149 Yet, Russia has placed such systems
(referred to as the Reconnaissance Strike Complex in Russian strategic
parlance) at the "epicenter" of its military modernization in the 2010s,
investing massively in C4ISR integration and electronic warfare and in
modernizing infrastructure, while boosting and streamlining command and
control, among other features.150

The net result is that, as stressed by a 2019 RAND report, the Kremlin
has implemented "a modern, whole-of-government C4ISR infrastructure that
will enable Russia to pursue its vision of net-centric or 'non-contact
warfare'"; these "advances in long-range strike, Russia\'s command and
control and information gathering systems are fundamental in their
ability to compete directly with the West and dominate regional
adversaries"151---an assessment shared by other studies.152
Significantly, the Russian military tried and tested its C4ISR
capabilities during the Syrian conflict.153

[The experience of European states during the 2011 Libyan conflict
showed that they lack the technological infrastructure and personnel to
autonomously use weapons systems in a coordinated manner: they would
need to replace the United States\' C4ISR systems that they currently
rely on; hire and train the personnel to operate them; and develop a
permanent, effective command structure to conduct effective joint
military operations in wartime.]{.underline} Likewise, in stark contrast
to Russia\'s unity of command, Europeans display an "enormous variation"
in their C4ISR capacities, with "both technological and operational gaps
within Europe."154 In sum, Europe exhibits a cacophony of C4ISR
capabilities.

[A final and related consideration that restraint scholars do not
sufficiently recognize is that Russia gains efficiencies---when compared
to Europe---because it is a single actor, rather than a collective
patchwork of countries.]{.underline} By contrast, as a 2018 European
Parliament report concludes, "[It is precisely because European defense
is fragmented by the decisions of 27 political and military chiefs of
staff, duplicates the same research, the same programs and the same
capabilities and has no chain of command that it is, collectively,
inefficient.]{.underline}"155 The report notes further that "increasing
the level of spending without first addressing the coherence between the
different national defense systems would only increase the amount of
wastage."156 Exactly how much efficiency is lost would depend on how
many European countries would need to act together to balance Russia;
but even two actors working together would result in less efficacy and
effectiveness as compared to a single, unitary actor of comparable
size.157 [If the United States pulled back, a single, centralized
Russian actor would confront a group of potential European balancers
with diverging threat perceptions that would face coordination
challenges likely to hamper their capacity to devise a common strategy,
to share the burdens of their defense investments, to rationalize
Europe\'s highly fragmented defense industrial base, to build integrated
C2 structures, and to sustain the development and deployment of a C4ISR
capacity.]{.underline} As a report of the French Senate states,
"Compared to other European countries, Russia enjoys a considerable but
not quantifiable advantage: unity of command. The Russian army has one
commanding authority, one hierarchy, one language, and one equipment
range. Obviously, at the operational level, these are very important
assets."158

### AT: Retrenchment /= Russian Invasion

#### Their ev is [wrong]{.underline} -- Europe's major powers [underestimate]{.underline} Russia. 

- France, Germany, and the UK

CNRS Research Fellow at Sciences Po and Center for International
Studies, director of the European Initiative for Security Studies,

Russia is uninmportant or not a threat

[Most smaller powers in Western and Southern Europe prioritize as their
main sources of concern transnational terrorism, WMD proliferation, and
instability across the Middle East and Northern Africa
(MENA)]{.underline} and the resulting flows of migrants (see table 1).46
By contrast, ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union, which was
perceived as the overarching conventional and nuclear threat during the
Cold War, Russia has little, if any, significance in their national
threat assessments.47 Indeed, some of these countries, such as Italy or
Spain, have long advocated for sustained engagement with Moscow.48

Likewise, two countries that do not share the same level of anxiety held
by most Central and Eastern European countries vis-à-vis Russia are
[Hungary and Bulgaria. Considering the threat of conventional war to be
minimal, and given their strong ties with Moscow, they instead
prioritize terrorism, migration flows, WMD proliferation, and
cyberattacks.]{.underline}49

Russia is a threat, but other threats are more significant

[Other countries also prioritize transnational terrorism, regional
turmoil around Europe and the MENA, cyberattacks, and illegal migration,
but display higher threat perceptions of Russia than do states in the
first category]{.underline} (see table 1). [They perceive Russia as a
threat, but nonetheless see other threats as relatively higher sources
of concern.]{.underline}50

Croatia\'s threat assessment, for instance, focuses largely on
challenges such as terrorism, regional instability, migration, and the
proliferation of WMD.51 Still, in a veiled yet clear reference to
Russia\'s influence in the Western Balkans, Croatian policymakers put
greater emphasis than the first group of countries on threats such as
"non-conventional, asymmetric, and cyber actions" that are "planned,
permanent and systematic activities supported by state bodies."52

[France]{.underline} is the only major power in this group. [Its threat
perceptions revolve, foremost, around transnational terrorism and
regional instability in Europe\'s southern periphery. French
policymakers consider jihadist terrorism as "the most immediate"
threat,]{.underline}53 especially in light of the steep rise in the
number of terrorist attacks on French soil since the mid-2010s.54 France
is also concerned with the proliferation of conventional and WMD-related
technology,55 as well as with regional instability in Northern Africa
and the Middle East.56 [The French government puts particular emphasis
on sub-Saharan Africa,]{.underline} where, partly because of its
postcolonial history, [France retains "a direct security and economic
interest" in the stability of the region]{.underline}.57 Accordingly,
although France has displayed growing concerns vis-à-vis Russia\'s
assertiveness after the Ukrainian crisis,58 other threats remain more
significant.

Russia and other threats have roughly equal significance

[The United Kingdom and Germany---together with less powerful Western
European states (Belgium and the Netherlands) and Denmark---consider
Russia and other security challenges to be equivalent threats (see table
1).]{.underline}

[British policymakers include both Russia and terrorism in the UK\'s
"Tier One" category of risk]{.underline}s (in terms of probability and
impact).59 In light of Russia\'s increasingly assertive behavior, they
assess that the "risks from state-based threats have both grown and
diversified,"60 which is why the UK "cannot rule out the possibility
that \[Moscow\] may feel tempted to act aggressively against NATO
Allies."61 According to a UK former senior defense official, the main
areas of concerns vis-à-vis Moscow are (1) Russia\'s military
modernization, including the development and deployment of weapon
systems that can threaten the UK\'s NATO allies; (2) Russia\'s gray-zone
activities (e.g., subversion, use of proxies, cyberattacks, use of
military-grade nerve agents for targeted killings); and (3) Moscow\'s
activities outside Europe, such as in parts of Africa, but, most
notably, in the Middle East.62

Yet, at the same time, [the UK sees transnational terrorism as an
equally substantial threat]{.underline}. British policymakers have
perceived a rising threat from terrorism since at least the 2005 London
bombings and the subsequent wave of terrorist attacks that swept across
Europe and the UK in the 2010s.63 In their eyes, "ISIL \[the Islamic
State of Iraq and the Levant\], Al Qa\'ida, and affiliates remain
committed to attacking UK and Western targets" and continue to be "the
most direct and immediate threat" to the UK\'s "domestic security."64 In
2015[, the British government therefore decided to increase its
counterterrorism spending by 30 percent, including £2 billion of new
investment in the capabilities of UK special forces.65]{.underline}

[Germany, too, considers terrorism and Russia to be threats of roughly
equal significance. German policymakers view terrorist attacks as "the
most immediate challenge" to their country\'s domestic
security.]{.underline}66 In 2018, Germany\'s minister of interior stated
that the security situation concerning terrorism continued to be "very
threatening."67 [For Germany, transnational terrorism is tied closely to
regional stability in the MENA and to the existence of failing states in
which terrorist organizations can thrive]{.underline}.68 Accordingly, it
seeks to bolster cooperation with partners in Africa and the Middle East
to train their security forces so as "to create a bulwark against
international terrorism."69

At the same time, [Germany sees Russia as "openly calling the European
peace order into question with its willingness to use force to advance
its own interests and to unilaterally redraw borders guaranteed under
international law, as it has done in Crimea and Eastern
Ukraine."]{.underline}70 According to the ministry of defense, "this has
far-reaching implications for security in Europe and thus for the
security of Germany."71 A comparison of Germany\'s 2006 White Paper and
of the subsequent strategic documents (i.e., the 2011 Defense Policy
Guidelines and the 2016 White Paper) highlights the enhanced focus of
the German armed forces on territorial defense since the Russia-Georgia
war and Moscow\'s landgrab in Crimea.72

Interviews with current and former German officials reveal that the
foreign affairs, interior, and defense ministries have different threat
assessments. Whereas the first two consider terrorism to be Germany\'s
main security challenge, the latter prioritizes Russia as the main
threat.73 Across the German government, terrorism and Russia ultimately
emerge as being roughly equally significant threats.

[Smaller Western European powers such as the Netherlands and Belgium
similarly consider Russia and other threats to be largely
equivalent.]{.underline}74 Likewise, in Northern Europe, Danish
policymakers rank terrorism and regional instability in the MENA---which
can provide fertile ground for terrorists---relatively higher than do
their Nordic neighbors in their threat assessments.75 At the same time,
Russia is seen as posing "a significant security challenge,"76 and its
military buildup and increased military exercises in the region, as well
as its use of gray-zone operations, are considered "a clear challenge"
to Denmark.77 The Danish government thus sees Russia, terrorism, and
regional instability in the MENA as equally significant threats.

Russia is the highest threat; other threats are also significant

Several Northern and Eastern European states have displayed mounting
threat perceptions of Russia---which they see as their major
threat---especially since the Russo-Georgian War and, increasingly, the
Ukrainian crisis (see table 1). Yet, they continue to share security
concerns vis-à-vis terrorism, regional instability in the MENA, and
illegal migration.

In Northern Europe, Norway and Sweden emphasize both the "long belt of
instability" to the south of Europe and terrorism as significant
national security concerns.78 Yet, most notably since the 2010s, Russia
has returned to the top of their national security concerns. In
particular, they highlight the development of Russia\'s
anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) capabilities, its numerous military
exercises in Northern Europe, and its activities in the Arctic as
amplifying the risk of an accident or a crisis resulting in unintended
escalation to war.79 The Norwegian government, for example, considers
that "Russia\'s overall military capacity is the most significant
security challenge for Norway and NATO."80

Likewise, in Central and Eastern Europe, although the Czech Republic,
Romania, and Slovakia also emphasize other security challenges (e.g.,
instability in the Southern Mediterranean and terrorism), their threat
assessments prioritize Russia\'s assertiveness.81 While refraining from
officially labeling Russia a threat, the Romanian government argues that
Russia\'s naval buildup---and the ensuing "destabilization of the
security situation in the Black Sea Extended Region"---"represent the
most important factor of military risk against national security."82

Russia is the dominant threat by far

The Baltic states, Finland, and Poland exhibit the highest threat
perceptions of Russia in Europe. The former Soviet-controlled states in
the Baltic region (i.e., Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) prioritize
Russia\'s conventional and gray-zone military threats as their core
national security concern.83 Likewise, given Finland\'s geographical
proximity to Russia and their shared border, policymakers in Helsinki
have viewed Russia as their dominant national security threat throughout
the post--Cold War period.84 Finland considers that the "use or threat
of military force against Finland cannot be excluded."85

Given its history of recurrent invasion by foreign powers, Poland has
also consistently put Russia at the center of its security concerns
since the end of the Cold War.86 Moscow\'s "aggressive policy"---through
which it aims to "destabilize the internal order of other states and to
question their territorial integrity"---is seen as "a threat mainly for
Poland and other countries in the region."87

Assessing the Counterargument: Can Europeans Balance Russia?

Together, [Europe\'s strategic cacophony and its defense capacity
shortfalls feed and reinforce each other.]{.underline} For one thing,
many of the needed steps to make up for Europe\'s defense capacity
shortfalls will require prolonged cooperation; Europeans would thus need
to overcome their entrenched strategic cacophony not just for a short
time, but over a very long period. Moreover, because diverging interests
hamper defense industrial cooperation among Europeans, this---coupled
with major capability shortfalls---deepens their technological
dependency on the United States, further reinforcing the challenges to
addressing Europe\'s capability shortfalls.

Restraint scholars arguing for a U.S. pullout would undoubtedly respond
that, even if Europe is currently split by strategic divisions and has
severe defense capacity shortfalls, [a U.S. withdrawal would result in
heightened European threat perceptions of Russia and thereby lead
Europeans to bolster their defense investments---thus prompting them to
come together to balance Russia]{.underline} (through a balancing
coalition or through the EU, or both). For restraint scholars, it is the
U.S. presence in Europe that affords Europeans the luxury of low threat
perceptions of Russia and thereby drives them to underinvest in defense.
Below, we assess the validity and robustness of this counterargument.

european threat perceptions after a u.s. withdrawal

We now evaluate how European threat perceptions would likely evolve if
the United States were to pull back, focusing first on Europe\'s three
major powers (France, the UK, and Germany) and then on its medium and
lesser powers.

Given its geographical location, colonial past, and continued engagement
in Africa, France tends to look south rather than east for the defense
of its core strategic interests.131 Furthermore, [France\'s strategic
outlook remains shaped partly by its Cold War,]{.underline} Gaullist
foreign policy legacy, [which was based on the willingness to carve out
a "third way" between the Soviet-led and the U.S.-led blocs through some
form of accommodation with Moscow while maintaining an independent
nuclear force and a French area of influence in Africa]{.underline}.132

[The UK, as an offshore seapower, has since the early Cold War concluded
that the only way to deter the Soviet Union]{.underline} (and later
Russia) [is to use the United States as a counterweight]{.underline}.133
Accordingly, the "special relationship" with the United States, both
bilaterally and through NATO, has been the center of gravity of the
UK\'s defense policy---as illustrated by its heavy reliance on U.S.
military technology.134 Indeed, [NATO has been the main vehicle through
which Britain has sought to entrench U.S. power in Europe and deter
external threats.]{.underline}135

Likewise, Ge[rmany, because of its history and location in the heart of
the European continent, has strategic priorities different from those of
France.]{.underline} The defeat and subsequent occupation of Germany in
World War II, including by the Soviet Union, was followed by the
division of the country in two, with one side under Soviet
influence---thus making Germany the geostrategic epicenter of the Cold
War. [After its reunification and the end of the Cold War, as well as
its self-imposed stringent parliamentary constraints on the use of
military force, Germany has opted for a combination of economic and
political integration with the EU and military reliance on NATO, with
the United States as the ultimate guarantor for its security and the
stability of the continent.]{.underline}136

[Idiosyncratic historical legacies, geography, and distinctive local
security environments have thus profoundly shaped the threat assessments
of the three major European powers.]{.underline} To be sure, these
differences existed during the Cold War, too, but they were muted by the
overwhelming, common Soviet threat.137 By contrast, in light of the
diversification of the post--Cold War threat environment, if the United
States withdrew from the continent, the threat perceptions of these
major powers would be unlikely to converge around Russia.138

In such a scenario, [the UK and Germany would be prone to exhibit
heightened threat perceptions vis-à-vis Russia]{.underline}. Given their
historical reliance upon NATO as their ultimate security guarantee, if
the United States were to remove its conventional and nuclear forces,
[the credibility of NATO\'s deterrent vis-à-vis Russia would founder in
the eyes of British and German policymakers. As a result, there is every
reason to expect they would raise the significance of Russia and of
territorial defense in their defense planning. At the same time, they
would still have to reckon with other significant threats]{.underline}
(e.g., transnational terrorism and regional stability in the MENA).

By contrast, [France\'s threat assessment would most likely remain
unchanged if the United States withdrew. Although France might view
Russia with greater concern, it would continue to prioritize terrorism
and, crucially, threats on Europe\'s southern periphery]{.underline}
(i.e., regional instability in the greater Mediterranean area, in
general, and in Africa, in particular). As a senior current French
defense official put it in an interview, "If the United States withdrew,
the risk represented by Russia would ostensibly be greater but, at the
same time, it would be greater only if France considered that the threat
posed by Russia to the Baltic states, Poland, etc. constitutes a threat
to our vital interests, which is far from sure." This is because threats
to Europe\'s southern periphery, such as "the destabilization of Africa
or the Middle East are considered to be a much higher priority than
Russia. ... Our vital interests are not threatened by Russia."139

In sum, in the case of a complete U.S. pullback from the continent,
London and Berlin would likely move rightward into the second column
from the right in table 1 (Russia is a higher threat, but other threats
are also significant), while France would not shift from its current
position. Given their differing threat prioritizations, the United
Kingdom, Germany, and France would be very unlikely to reach agreement
on a common position vis-à-vis Russia. [Germany and the UK might lean
more toward balancing and expand bilateral defense cooperation to that
end.]{.underline} However, unlike countries that view Russia as the
dominant threat by far (i.e., the Baltic states and Poland), [they would
face important trade-offs in their allocation of resources---between
territorial defense and power projection capabilities, between Europe\'s
eastern and southern periphery, and so on---given that they would
continue to grapple with other significant threats.]{.underline} For its
part, because France would likely continue to prioritize threats on
Europe\'s southern periphery, it would be unlikely to provide a
substantial (if any) contribution to a balancing coalition. In fact, it
might opt for accommodation with Russia to develop a sphere of influence
in Western/Southern Europe or, potentially, even see some strategic
advantages to band-wagoning with Russia.

[This predicament would be further compounded by fundamental divergences
in threat perceptions among Europe\'s medium and small
powers.]{.underline} Except for lesser powers in Northern and Eastern
Europe (i.e., the Baltic states and Poland), which would consistently
see Russia as their overriding threat, [the other medium and small
European states would likely display profoundly different reactions to a
U.S. pullback, depending on their geographic location, history, and
strategic priorities.]{.underline} While some countries would
undoubtedly perceive a higher threat from Russia and thus revise their
threat assessments (moving one column to the right in table 1), o[thers
would likely maintain their existing threat hierarchization]{.underline}
given the equivalent or higher priority they assign to other threats or
regions, or both. In fact, there is every indication that most medium
and small European countries that currently perceive threats other than
Russia to be more significant or dominant would be highly unlikely to
revise their threat assessment. [Several of these countries might even
become neutral or bandwagon with Moscow.]{.underline} It is therefore
extremely implausible that all European states would move Russia up in
their ranking of threats. And even if they did, the cacophony of threat
perception would remain, with only a few lesser powers in Northern and
Eastern Europe perceiving Russia as their dominant threat.

Restraint scholars might reply that the above discussion is excessively
pessimistic about the chances for European defense coordination because
it neglects the role the EU can play in bringing Europe together in the
security realm if the United States leaves.140 [The EU is not an
effective institutional platform for overcoming Europe\'s strategic
divergence]{.underline}, however. There are many reasons for this, with
the most notable being that the EU is a kaleidoscope of countries with
diverging interests that operates on the basis of consensus in the field
of foreign and defense policy---thus making the Common Security and
Defense Policy a "structurally limited undertaking."141 If the United
States were to pull back, [rather than work to overcome European
divisions, the EU would be prone to inaction because of such divisions.
Thus, only an effective institutional structure could probably overcome,
or at least mitigate, Europe\'s divisions, but strategic cacophony would
prevent the EU from being enabled to perform this function.]{.underline}

how easily can europeans balance russia\'s military strength?

[A complete U.S. withdrawal would thus not mitigate Europe\'s strategic
cacophony and could exacerbate it.]{.underline} Restraint scholars might
argue, however, that, [even if threat perceptions did not converge
across Europe, balancing Russia would not require much effort because it
is so weak]{.underline}. Yet, [Russia is a much tougher adversary to
match than restraint scholars now assess it to be---both in the
conventional and the nuclear realms.]{.underline}

### 2AC\-\--Transition Wars Violent

The [conventional wisdom about current trends in the balance of power
relies heavily on power transition theory, which assumes that economic
convergence is an unconditional process in which poorer countries
inevitably catch up with richer countries.]{.underline} Economists,
however, have shown that convergence is rare and conditional on a set of
geographic, institutional, and demographic factors that, so far, have
not been incorporated into major theories of international change. In
this article, [I have discussed these factors and analyzed the growth
prospects of the United States and China in light of them. The results
cast doubt on China\'s ability to rival the United States as an economic
and military superpower.]{.underline} The good news is that the world is
unlikely to experience a full-blown hegemonic rivalry anytime soon. This
is an extraordinary development for global security. [**In the past five
hundred years alone, there have been sixteen hegemonic competitions in
which a rising power challenged a ruling power for top-dog status.**
Twelve of them ended in catastrophic wars, and even some of the peaceful
cases were brutal cold wars that inflicted tremendous harm.]{.underline}
During the Cold War, for example, the United States and the Soviet Union
divided the globe into rival blocs, waged proxy wars that killed
millions of people, and brought the world to the brink of nuclear
Armageddon. Today, by contrast, **[the United States does not face a
peer competitor]{.underline}**, and the world, though far from perfect,
**[is more peaceful and prosperous than ever before]{.underline}**. The
bad news is that **[China may become more authoritarian at home and
aggressive abroad as its economic growth slows, and this shift may
undermine global security in numerous areas.]{.underline}** History
suggests that [when a rising power peaks and starts to decline before
its ambitions have been fulfilled, its people tend to become
disgruntled, and its leaders usually respond by suppressing domestic
dissent and demonizing foreign adversaries.]{.underline} Russia, for
example, has become more hostile, revanchist, and disruptive since the
collapse in world oil prices in the late 2000s gutted the Russian
economy and crimped President Vladimir Putin\'s popularity. China seems
to be going down a similar path. Over the past decade, China\'s economic
growth rates have been cut in half, and the Chinese government has
responded by massively expanding its internal security system, exporting
parts of that system to other countries, waging information warfare on
democratic countries, promoting "internet sovereignty," flouting
international trade rules, and ramping up its military presence on and
around disputed features in the East and South China Seas in flagrant
violation of international law. These actions may be just a preview of
what is to come in the years ahead, as [the economic, geographic, and
demographic problems highlighted above grow worse.]{.underline} Trade
disputes and territorial conflicts are only the most obvious risks posed
by a stagnating and recalcitrant China. Less obvious are transnational
problems, such as climate change and disease, which may fester without
Chinese cooperation. **[Avoiding this fate requires other countries, and
especially the United States, to handle China with a blend of
reassurance and deterrence.]{.underline}** Unfortunately, the widespread
view that China is an emerging superpower has caused the United States
to abandon engagement in favor of unbridled competition. In just the
past few years, the United States has labeled China a rival, imposed
steep tariffs on Chinese goods and severe restrictions on Chinese
investment and immigration, inserted US forces into East Asian
territorial disputes, and made plans to hit China early and hard in the
event of war. **[This competition has not only increased the risk of
US--China conflict but also threatened global security]{.underline}** by
hamstringing the World Trade Organization and effectively killing the
Paris Climate Accord and the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty. Thus,
**[the stage has been set for tragic conflict]{.underline}**: China is
becoming more recalcitrant as it suffers slowing growth, while the
United States, consumed by false prophecies of China\'s inexorable rise,
is becoming more confrontational. [The main threat to global security,
therefore, is]{.underline} not a US-China power transition driven by
economic convergence but [divergence in US and Chinese perceptions about
the long-term trends in the balance of power.]{.underline} China may not
be able to stem its growth slowdown, but Americans can take note of it
and recalibrate US policy accordingly.

12 Lessons from a Peaceful Transition LooKiNg AcRoss A hundred years of
America growing stronger and more assertive in the international order,
[the most striking element is how highly contingent a peaceful outcome
was in the transition from British to American hegemony.]{.underline}
This peacefulness hinged on a unique sense of political sameness, both
domestically and in in- ternational practice, for the crucial years of
America surpassing Britain that allowed the hegemon to diminish the
importance of relative power between them. The sense of sameness
dissipated soon after the transition, and [America set sail on radically
changing the international order to more closely reflect its domestic
political compact.]{.underline} [To the extent that the British to
American transition is illustrative for future changes, it cautions deep
skepticism]{.underline}---both that the transition can occur peacefully
and that, even if it should occur peacefully, the international order
that results will operate on terms the United States has set in its
hegemony. [This is especially true if the subsequent hegemon emerges not
from within the American order but from the much more probable direction
of China.]{.underline} 271 In stark terms, the lessons of the British to
American case for future hegemonic transitions are four: (1) [the
prospects for a peaceful hegemonic transition are small even in the most
conducive circum- stances]{.underline}; (2) **[differences in political
culture and structure of government make an American to Chinese
hegemonic transition much less likely to be peaceful]{.underline}**; (3)
[America is making the same strategic choice with China that Great
Britain did with a rising America, that it can be induced to comply with
extant rules; and (4) America ought to expect that a hegemonic China
will rewrite the rules to reflect its domestic political
culture]{.underline}, just as America itself did. The Crossing of
Courses TharetaGt Britain failed to maintain its dominance in the
inter - national order is a simple fact; the United States grew richer,
stronger, and more assertive. As a result, America demanded and received
the ability to reset the rules by which states operated inter-
nationally. Since the establishment of the state system, and even be-
fore, hegemonic transitions have occurred by force. [A rising power
tests its mettle against the dominant power]{.underline}, succeeding or
failing by force of arms. **[That was not the character of the
transition from British to American dominance; it was uniquely
peaceful.]{.underline}** Why it was uniquely peaceful has been the
subject of this book. Theories about state behavior necessarily look to
explain the pre- ponderance of the data. As the only peaceful
transition, [the Anglo- American hegemonic transition is an
outlier]{.underline}, so it is not surprising that [prevailing theories
provide imperfect explanations]{.underline} for its history. Yet it is
an extremely important case, as [the only transition achieved without
cataclysmic violence.]{.underline} Understanding why it occurred without
violence is essential to determining whether future hegemonic
transitions can occur peacefully, and what the 272 nature of the
international order will be once such transitions have occurred. A
realpolitik explanation for what transpired between Great Britain and
the United States from 1823 to 1922 would be that a rising power began
probing the established hegemon, backed off when it amisnecter, easndt
advanced when the hegemon was distracted or iostehuernwwilling to
counter the challenge. Building on a repu- tation for twisting the
lion's tail, an upstart America cannily took credit for what Britain
would need to do to prevent European colo- nization of the western
hemisphere in 1823, was slapped down while attempting a steal of the
Oregon Territory in 1853, managed to threaten just enough trouble for
Britain in 1861--1863 to tip the scales against recognition of the
Confederacy, burnished its strength win- ning the Indian Wars, and
consolidated a continental economic platform. [Ultimately the economic
and military strength of the rising power were so compelling that,
confronted with war during the 1895 Venezuelan debt crises, Great
Britain instead conceded.]{.underline} Cooperation over Venezuela and
during the Spanish-American War would illustrate a waning power buying
goodwill with a new hagt eims,ojnu---mtping on the bandwagon. Being more
con - cerned with a rising Germany than a fading Britain, the United
States joined in the Great War on the Allied side and brokered a peace,
both at Versailles and in the Washington Naval Treaties, that locked in
its own superiority. All seems sensible enough in that telling. But [the
realpolitik story line cannot adequately account for several elements of
the history, the most important elements in producing a peaceful
transition]{.underline}: why Britain at the height of its powers offered
cooperation to its rising rival in 1823; why Britain declined to press
its advantage over Oregon in 1845; why Britain resisted an inexpensive
opportunity to 273 deal a devastating blow before 1863 during the
American Civil War; why the two countries developed such a vibrant sense
of sameness during their introspective decades, unique for both
countries from any other international relations; why Britain encouraged
American expansion into the Pacific and enabled American success in the
Smpearniciashn-WA ar; why the United States grew more liberal as it grew
more powerful; and why America in the time of its hegemony used its
power to try and create a diffnertekind of international order.
Menatsnoy feBlermitish strategy accounted for by realpolitik as [a
waning power accommodating a waxing power seem instead to be
characteristics of British foreign policy across the whole of its
dominance of the international order]{.underline}; to use Silicon Valley
termi- nology, they are features, not bugs. **[Great Britain was a
peculiar kind of hegemon.]{.underline}** It never seemed to feel its own
strength, perhaps because the strategy it employed across 150 years
always required partner- ships to succeed. Balancing conflicting
interests and quarrelsome partners for temporary gain was Great
Britain's genius. In contrast atodAumrinergicits hegemony, [Britain
seemed always intensely conscious of its vulnerabilities rather than
exalting in its strengths.]{.underline} Hlseowtoeexplain Great Britain,
ascendant in 1823, seeking out common cause with an America barely able
to protect its own coast- line in order to prevent further European
colonization in the western hemisphere? Great Britain had a genius for
piecing together mosaics of mar- ginal contributors for tactical
advantage. Governments from those of Earl of Liverpool to David Lloyd
George were always temporizing, finding narrow bases for ephemeral
collusion to specific purpose with a fluid collection of partners. It
was a cost-efficient geostrategy that succeeded spectacularly until the
international order calcified 274 into standing alliances. And when that
more rigid international order emerged at the end of the nineteenth
century, [Britain had laid the trace lines for more stable cooperation
with two of the three emergent great powers, Japan and the United
States. It is unfair to British statesmen to conclude, as Paul Kennedy
does, that they always accommodated their challengers.]{.underline}1
They did not, at least, always accommodate the United States, pushing
back on both American territorial demands for Oregon and the revisionist
legal claims for superiority in law of democratic governments. Presi-
dent James Polk probably lost more in the 1845 confrontation over Oregon
than he would have gained by playing a longer hand and letting the tide
of American settlers make the case for the boundary location of British
Columbia. The government of Henry John Temple, Third Viscount Palmerston
was sorely tempted twice before 1863 to recognize the Confederate States
during the American Civil War, considering it in Britain's interests to
do so. [The British inclina- tion even in 1895 was to put America in its
subordinate place and deride its claims for a sphere of influence in the
Americas.]{.underline} British governments defined their interests
expansively and threatened force effectively to constrain American
challenges. [Confrontation was a routine part of British-American
interaction for much of the nine- teenth century.]{.underline} The
theory that democracy produced a peaceful transition is only partly
borne out in the Anglo-American transition. [The difference in form of
government between Great Britain and America did in- crease the
likelihood of hegemonic confrontation between the two
countries.]{.underline} British statesmen were appalled at the type of
government on display in America. In part this was a reflection of class
privilege in Britain, but leaders' aversion to democracy was more than
just prejudice. Speaking the same language, the British had a front row
275 seat for the demagoguery, recklessness, and corruption of electoral
politics on display in America after the decorum of the founding fathers
gave way to Jacksonian America. Theryewnot inaccurate in anticipating
that democracy would produce a bellicose state un- willing to accept the
established practices of great powers. A rising Aa mwaesriacn illiberal
Amer ica in very many respects. Yet [even democratic British leaders did
not predict that a risen America would choose to reconstruct the
international order in profoundly liberal ways.]{.underline} British
leaders before 1867 feared how American influence could permeate their
national boundary, a concern uniquely posed by America. [The American
experiment echoed through British debates on electoral reform; it was
the only model of functioning democ- racy and therefore the basis for
comparison of what Britain wanted and did not want in its own
democratization.]{.underline} Before the electoral reforms, British
governments worried about infection of American attitudes in the British
body politic. They had a rich appreciation for the appeal of American
ideals: George Canning championed James Monroe's announcement in 1823
because it associated Britain with America's international appeal.
Robert Peel declined to push British advantage over James Polk's 1845
exposure in Oregon when British reformers took up America's case. In
1863 Palmerston was cautious not to expose his government to pressure
for greater dateimzaotciorn by aligning with a Southern cause unpop ular
with those least represented in British politics. ThespsrofcBritish
adteimzaotciorn eventually brought the po litical cultures of the two
countries together and gave them a sense of distinction from other
states, all of which were differently constituted. Before electoral re-
form in Britain, though, [the democratic divide was cause for deep
distrust between Britain and America.]{.underline} 276 aDteizmaoticorn
was not the only threat Amer ica posed to British policy, however.
[Choices about America had a unique resonance because of
immigration.]{.underline} British leaders had no trepidation about
domestic repercussions of policy toward other countries; with Amer- aic,
British leaders had to calculate the way anti- American policies would
affect attitudes in Ireland, Scotland, and even within England. No other
country could play a positive role in mobilizing public sentiment,
reaching into domestic politics to affect foreign policy. Palmerston saw
the dimensions of that challenge in 1863 and pulled back from
recognizing the Confederacy. The foreign policy gain wasn't worth the
domestic policy cost of greater diffi- culty controlling Ireland and
Scotland. Franklin Delano Roosevelt threatened revolt in Britain's
colonies if Britain made a separate peace with Japan in 1936. America's
ability to reach into other countries' domestic policies, and the
comparative difficulty of other countries being able to effect a more
kaleidoscopic American body politic, provided a significant bargaining
advantage in American foreign policy. Democracy and immigration affected
foreign policy in one other aimntpowraty for Great Britain: Americans
mobilizing against their own government's policies considered too
beneficial to Britain. American nationality initially defined itself in
contrast to Britain, creating a natural antipathy. But even as that
generalized effect abated, the specific effect of American immigrant
constituencies grew to penalize British foreign policy because of
British domestic policy. Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, Third
Marquess of Salisbury got stung in Senate consideration of the
arbitration treaty by the scorpion tail of Irish American resentment of
Britain's in- sensitivity during the Great Irish Famine. President
Woodrow Wilson's fury at "hyphenated Americans" denying the League of
277 Nations shows the Irish American retribution for Irish partition and
German American resentment of ascribing all war guilt and severe
reparations to Germany. Another significant advantage afforded a rising
America was re- course to the public. Due to the American political
system's frequent elections being tied more tightly to public attitudes,
[presidents could reinforce their authority in foreign policy by
appealing to public sen- timent.]{.underline} James Monroe, James Polk,
Abraham Lincoln, and Grover Cleveland all played this card to great
effect during foreign policy negotiations with Britain, capitalizing on
the caricature of the masses as easily whipped into an uncontrollable
frenzy. Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt were acknowledged to be
swim- ming against strong currents of public opposition. Canning un-
derstood Monroe was grandstanding with his 1823 proclamation and
declined to even acknowledge it. Peel struck a deal over Oregon before
America's victory in Mexico out of concern that the public would then
push Polk to greater intransigence. Palmerston gave Lin- coln leeway
during the Trent affair, considering him hemmed in by public opinion.
Salisbury changed tack on Venezuela after the roar of public support for
Cleveland's unexpectedly aggressive assertion of the Monroe Doctrine in
1895. Democracy was thus a structural advantage for a rising America as
it engaged the established great power. That would not have been the
case if Britain were not rdaetmizoincg; [an authoritarian state would
have had greater latitude in ignoring public attitudes.]{.underline} But
[theories that domestic politics are determinative of foreign policy
also falter as explanation for British and American behavior in the
transition.]{.underline} Britain did become more accommodating toward Aa
monecriec both were democracies, and public sentiment did trend strongly
in America's favor. But Salisbury did not make the 278 strategic shift
in response to public attitudes in 1895; if they were
anllti,mthpeoSrtalisbury government would not have initially taken a
strong stand on Venezuela. Salisbury made the shift because the
Venezuelan crisis brought into focus a strategic problem Britain needed
to solve: it was overextended and looking for power to un- derwrite
British objectives. Public sentimentality about America en- abled a
choice, but it did not dictate that choice. Aa mis etrhiec even more di
fficult case to make for domestic pol- itics driving foreign policy. As
loud and combative as the American public was, and careful as American
presidents had to be in mar- shaling opinion to support of their
policies, [opinion factors much more in campaigning than
governing.]{.underline} Public attitudes did not factor at all in
President Monroe's declaration. President Polk did not allow public
enthusiasm for "Fiftyo-ufr forty or fight" to pre- vent compromise with
Britain over the Oregon boundary. President Lincoln did not allow public
outrage over the Trent affair drive a damaging choice during the Civil
War. President Cleveland did not allow a restive public to force his
hand on the annexation of Hawaii nor in Venezuela. President William
McKinley was not stampeded to war with Spain with the sinking of the USS
Maine. President The- oe dore Roos velt only expanded the Monroe
Doctrine in 1902 re- sponding to the Arbitration Court's decision, not
public or business interests. Public attitudes did press on President
Warren G. Harding in 1921 to find some means less destructive and costly
than war for the United States to engage in the world, but perhaps that
shows that [hegemony gives American presidents the latitude---the margin
for error---to indulge public attitudes.]{.underline} Aa'smvearuicnted
morality, such a prominent part of its own de - scription of itself,
proved limber between 1823 and 1923; it never im- pinged on the
destruction of Indian tribes and their way of life. In 279 fact, an
alternate morality in the form of [Manifest Destiny was developed to
rationalize westward expansion.]{.underline} The morality of colo-
nialism was, to America's credit, a major political issue from the 1870s
onward as America began expanding its political control be- yond
territory inhabited by Americans. But the issue was more ab- stract, as
it did not affect Americans directly. As with the influence of public
attitudes, America's morality in foreign policy correlates with the
increase in its power. Like public opinion, indulging mo- rality in
foreign policy may be a luxury of hegemony. [Something important changed
in interactions between Great Britain and America in
1895]{.underline}---or, more accurately, the 1895 Venezu- elan debt
crises revealed changes that had been long accruing. Er- nest May, who
considers domestic politics and morality the driving forces of American
foreign policy across this time frame, even con- cedes that "Cleveland
and Olney startled England and the United States into one another's
arms."2 The 1870s had been introspective years for both Great Britain
and the United States, with Britain adapting to the changes wrought by
expansion of the voting fran- chise and America consolidating its hold
over a continental expanse. The result of this was an America that in
many important respects had become an empire and a Britain that had
become a democracy. The result of the changes was to make the currency
of power less iamntpionrthe British- American relationship than it was
in other state relationships. [Both of these changes were essential in
the peaceful transition of hegemony.]{.underline} Great Britain would
not have trusted that America out in the world would act as Britain did
had America not eschewed its republican morality with the conquest of
its Indian Wars. **[America would not have considered Britain its
natural ally if Britain had not democratized. The transformations of
both societies occurring simultaneously is an historical
anomaly]{.underline}**--- serendipitous, but anoma- lous. If America had
not come to act like a traditional great power rather than continuing to
propound its ideology in foreign policy, Great Britain might well have
countered rather than encouraged Aa'smreorliec in the world. If Great
Britain had not become a re- lated government, the United States might
well have forced foreign policy concessions from Britain as it did from
other countries. [The sense of sameness that pervades Anglo-American
relations in the late nineteenth century allowed the British and
American governments to view each other's power in less threatening
terms.]{.underline} Their shifting national perceptions, their ideas of
each other and the international order, are hugely important in making
the hege- monic transition peaceful. Britain did not lose the will to
enforce its international order---something sorrowfully evident by the
three million British casualties in World War I. What explains Great
Britain not contesting America's challenge to the established inter-
national order is instead that [Britain and the United States came to
perceive each other's power in uniquely unthreatening terms. This
perspective was the basis for peaceful resolution]{.underline} to the
1895 Venezuelan debt crisis, British endorsement of Hawaii's annexation
in 1898, assistance to American arms during the Spanish-American War,
encouragement for Cuba and the Philippines as American col- onies,
America's 1902 willingness to enforce commercial contracts in the
western hemisphere, America's lenient attitude toward Brit- ain's World
War I blockade and even its choice to join the allied war effort on land
in 1917. During the crucial passage of dominance frreoamt BGritain to
the United States, the two countries viewed their interests as
indistinguishable, their military power as cumu- lative. They enabled
and justified each other's foreign policy choices, a collusion
championed in Rudyard Kipling's White Man's Burden. 281 **[The
glittering moment of Anglo-American sameness was remarkably
short-lived.]{.underline}** ThreeGat War undoubtedly had much to do with
Aa mreecroiicling from a traditional great power role. America
rititslkeinagndsodel manding so much in the a ftermath of the war would
remind Britain of tiresome pre-rapprochement American grandstanding.
America emerged from World War I as the interna- tional order's
strongest country by far. Neither its economy nor its military suffered
losses of the kind or magnitude of Europe's great powers, and its
potential far outstripped its performance. The "war to end all wars"
leftaAsmtaenrdicing tallest among contenders for dominance of the
international order. What America chose to do with that power is what
drove an end to the special intertwining of British and American
interests. First at Versailles, and then even more adamantly in the
Wash- ington Naval Treaties, a hegemonic United States attempted to
build an international order of great power restraint. Limiting the
means of war would remove the causes of war, prejudice governments
toward domestic preoccupations, and allow mutually enriching eco- nomic
competition. America mistook international politics to be a macrocosm of
its domestic politics. aA'smterraincsformation---or perhaps reversion is
more accurate, since many of the notions pervade American thinking about
inter- national relations before 1890---alarmed the British government.
Lord Salisbury, Joseph Chamberlain, and Arthur Balfour had built British
strategy on a foundation of American might underwriting British
interests; those interests were diverging from America's. The ultimate
achievement of that British strategy, American soldiers providing the
winning margin of a European land war in reinforce- ment of Britain,
would be the anagnorisisafotor Abrminegricabout a very
diffnerteinternational order. 3 282 After World War I, republican
messianism returned to American foreign policy, and [a hegemonic America
became ambitious to change the rules of order.]{.underline} As it had
prohibited European coloniza- tion of the nascent nations of the western
hemisphere in 1823, pro- claimed a superior right in law for
representative governments in 1845, and renounced the right of states
that abused their citizens in 1898, America would advance its republican
principles. **[The reality of a hegemonic America was even more
sweepingly ambitious than the Canadian representative of Britain's
empire had warned]{.underline}** in 1921: Aa mwaesrincot satis fied
being a law unto itself; it would bend the international order to make
its law universal practice. [The world America wanted was one in which
Britain was not uniquely advantaged or influential over America, because
the rest of the world made itself like America and Britain.]{.underline}
And the United States moved quickly to try and establish that world.
[The schism was apparent]{.underline} in the 1916 American naval program
that would over- take Britain's navy, deplored by the British and
American negotia- tors at Versailles, and made manifest in American
proposals at the 1921 Washington Naval Conference. The resulting
treaties estab- lished parity between the British and American navies
and thus were importantly symbolic of America overtaking Britain as
hegemon. Implementation of the treaties would further showcase the inno-
vative dynamism of America and Britain's other rising rival, Japan. It
would take nineteen years of further Japanese dynamism to push Britain
and the United States back into collusion, and the result of that war
would redouble American belief that a state's domestic po- lailticulture
was determinative of its be havior in the interna- tional order. [This
cast Britain's imperial policies after World War II in sharp and
negative relief, making impossible the sustainment of Britain's unique
intertwining with the United States that had occurred during the war. It
is easy to imagine different Anglo-American relationships that might
have resulted if the special relationship did not cohere at the
historical moment that it did.]{.underline} There are so many
particularities to both countries and in the timing and manner of their
collusion in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as
America thrust outward and Britain became concerned about the burdens of
its for- eign policies. Could the cultural similarities have trumped
British concern about a genuinely republican foreign policy? If America
had seemed likely to advance self-determination in ways that threatened
Britain's empire, or succeeded in fostering political change in coun-
tries with important economic resources, Britain might well have used
its military might to prevent an expansion of American power. Instead of
assisting American efforts in the Spanish-American War, Britain might
have thrown its weight behind the Spanish crown, to positive effect for
its relationships with continental European powers. When Britain flirted
with recognizing the Confederacy, the Amer- ican minister to St.
Petersburg, Cassius Marcellus Clay, publicly questioned, "Is England so
secure in the future against home revolt or foreign ambition as to
venture, now in our need, to plant the seeds of revenge in all our
future?"4 Might America have reached more aggressively in to British
domestic politics, becoming an agent provocateur instead of a model for
reform? That could have reig- nited a contest over Canada, which an
America steaming out of its Civil War might have taken from British
control (and thus perhaps wading into a quicksand of Canadian
insurgency). A Fenian Army might have mobilized for Ireland itself, with
overt American sup- port (beyond throwing money into Irish flags during
St Patrick's 284 Day parades) goading Britain's sore. Or the American
government could have agitated Britain's workingmen and urban poor,
threat- ening Britain with the revolution its elites so feared. American
republicanism was probably too deeply in bone and anti-British sen-
timent too sturdy a factor in American politics in the nineteenth
century to have given the British much confidence of turning the
eAompleeriacgaaninpst their government. But [the transition from British
to American hegemony reads more like a romance than a realpolitik
primer.]{.underline} There is American yearning for the stature accorded
by British attention; the courtship of con- vieennce; marriage proposals
o ffered several times by Britain and always formally spurned by
America, even as it tried to retain the affeacvtoirosnBartietafin was
performing; development of tender regard for each other's peculiarities;
a relationship maturing into sober appreciation of common interests and
mutually beneficial patterns; anxiety from both as fissures emerged over
what future each wanted; the heartbreak of separation; and experience
with others reuniting them in gratitude. [Britain remains unique in its
ability to understand and negotiate the corridors of American power, and
more successful than any other state in harnessing American strength to
advantage of its interests.]{.underline} It had the structural benefit
of being the first mover, along with continuing advantages accruing from
linguistic and cultural similarities. But these can be easily
overstated. Britain's connection with America is less organic than
cultivated, as the resurgence of a special relationship in the run up to
and during World War II dem- onstrates. British governments often feel
they have too little influ- ence with American governments; all others
wish they had what Britain has. It was, and is, in Britain's interest to
capitalize on Amer- ican power, and Britain is smart enough to do so
shrewdly and 285 with a light enough touch that Americans hardly ever
notice. It is difficult to imagine America replicating that feat with
any poten- tially rising powers. The Same River Twice? [A hundred years
after the moment when America shook off Britain and strode forward to
reshape the international order in its image come other claimants for
global dominance, growing in strength and testing alternatives to the
American equation for dominance of the international order. China, in
particular, merits examination]{.underline} because of the momentousness
of its great leap forward since the economic reforms of 1978. Its
dynamism has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, with
an economic growth rate of e9r.8cepnt between 1978 and 2005. 5
Afterntaucry of humiliation, its success has fostered a swaggering
nationalism. It is the world's second largest economy, and even if it
fails to maintain its galloping growth rate it may well surpass the
United States. [The Chinese government has a fundamentally different
model of the relationship between the state and its people than does
America]{.underline}: it is counting on prosperity preventing demands
for po litical ireaoennpr, easrevtertsal of the dynamic that Amer ica
asserts as the nalaoturdrer of politics. It has an increasingly
combative military being primed with high-tech weaponry. And it
envisions a mani- festly diffnerteregional order in Asia than does the
United States. John Maynard Keynes famously quipped that ["practical
men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual
influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct
economist."]{.underline} Many of the practical men and women running
American policy toward a rising China are unwittingly enslaved to the
ideas of living political scientist Francis Fukuyama. Policy makers
often deride Fukuyama's 286 The End of History and the Last Man as
though he were proclaiming that events would cease to occur, rather than
ruminating on Hegel's critique of traditional liberalism and advocacy of
a state with lim- ited powers based on social consent.6hYoestetsame
policy makers have also consistently across more than forty years
supported an ap- proach to the world based on the Fukuyaman belief that
sustained success is impossible for states that are undemocratic and
that there can be no successful challenger to the Western model of
market economies and representative governance. It is the lesson the
West took from World War II and the collapse of the Soviet bloc. It is
en- shrined in Robert Zoellick's solemn invocation for China to be- come
a "responsible stakeholder" in the international order. It is the
rationalization for American businesses to invest in and shift man-
ufacturing to China. What America means by "responsible stakeholder" is,
of course, a China that accepts as given the rules of the international
order Aa mhaesriecstablished. Amer ica supports a powerful and pros-
perous China because it is wagering there cannot be a powerful and
prosperous China unless it becomes democratic, that a demo- cratic China
will dovetail into the same interests as America, that
hshoasreiinngtetrests it will share the burden of upholding them, and
that in upholding those interests China will conduct itself as Aa
mcoenrdicucts itself. It is the strategic calculation Salisbury's
government made in 1895 about the United States. Salisbury's
reorientation of British policy was essential to a peaceful transition
of hegemony between Great Britain and the United States. So, too, may a
Fukuyaman orientation of American policy prove essential to a peaceful
transition of hegemony between aAmanedriCc hina should it occur. If
prevention of war is the metric, Salisbury's policy is the right choice.
But it merits recollecting that 287 [Salisbury's gamble ultimately
proved wrong: the United States did not fully share Britain's interests
and did not uphold the rules Britain had established. A hegemonic
America established its own rules, based on its domestic
ideology.]{.underline} G. John Ikenberry has emphasized the importance
of liberality in the American-led order.7 The rules are considered by
participants--- not just the dominant power---to be fair and fairly
applied. This cul- ture invests other powers in helping uphold the order
and utilizes legitimacy to drive down the cost to the United States of
sustaining the order. [The American-led order thus has a great capacity
to accommodate fluctuations of strength---which is to say that rising
powers need not change the rules in order to become dominant in the
existing order.]{.underline} But [China clearly does want to change the
rules---even as it benefits from them.]{.underline} China has afforded
the United States glimpses at least as numerous as nineteenth-century
America did for Britain that the country's reflexes are diffnertefrom
those of the reigning hegemon. It does not embrace the philosophy that
people have in- herent rights and loan them in limited ways to
government. It cen- tralizes power beyond the constraint of laws or
institutions. It does not hold the wielders of power accountable to the
public by either election or journalism. It enforces a bias in favor of
national corpo- rations, both overtly through access to Chinese markets
and opaquely through theft of intellectual property. [It appears to view
the international order as a tribute system, with weak states forced
into compliance and strong states lulled into accepting small changes by
threat of consequences out of all proportion to the
infraction.]{.underline} It would thereby destroy the alliance system
that is the basis for American presence in the region and provision of
defense for the weak states on China's periphery. While China's is
currently 288 a regional strategy, [there is little reason to believe it
would not also constitute a global strategy if the nation is in the
position to assert one.]{.underline} This suggests that **[China will
pose a normative challenge as well as a power challenge to the
American-led order.]{.underline}**8 Salisbury, Chamberlain, and Balfour
at least had the strong bases of common political culture and public
affection between the two countries when they placed their bet on a
rising America aligning so closely with Great Britain that both nations'
power could be har- nessed for Britain's interests. The United States is
making the same bet on much shakier grounds with China. To be sure,
America has hedged its bets with China. It maintains alliance
relationships that support America's military reach and in- tensify when
China behaves threateningly. It is attempting a major trade pact that
will set the rules for Asia's economies. It is purport- edly
"rebalancing" its attention to Asia. Its military forces are reen- gaged
on the challenge of a great power war and the defense spending for
adequate preparation. Few defense specialists believe China's military
could defeat America's, but the Pentagon watches with anx- iety at
China's ability to develop asymmetric capabilities that might render
moot America's military advantages. Few defense specialists in 1895
would have agreed that America's military could defeat Britain's, and
yet Salisbury fundamentally changed the course of British strategy to
cede American objectives rather than persist in the rules of order
Britain had set and previ- ously enforced. Might not America cede China
even more rather than fight a war that could collapse American power in
the Pacific? Another element of the challenge is that military power is
a de- rivative index; it relies in large measure on a country's economic
base. America's consolation thus far with China's meteoric rise is that
China's economy is merely a cheap manufacturing base that 289 has yet to
prove it can navigate the middle-income trap, whereas Aa'smwereiaclth is
driven by innovation. This, too, is Fukuyama's long shadow: belief that
only free societies can foster the intellec- tual creativity to sustain
dynamism. It is a complacency that Ger- many's rise in the prewar years
ought to have shattered. Freedom is not the only motivator for
innovation. Authoritarian capitalism in China is proving itself as
creative and unrestrained as its American counterpart. [Prosperity is
the main allure of the authoritarian model]{.underline}, espe- cially
when capitalism's champions lag.9 Nationalism, too, is a puol wfoerrcfe.
Moreover, the outsize disputatiousness and risk tol - erance of
Americans may itself be a national characteristic rather than a
universal human attribute. Most Europeans choose forms of governance and
economy less tumultuous than those of Ameri- cans; public acceptance of
retrograde motion in democratizing iseosciiseto ften a function of
exhaustion with the enervation of po- lailtiacnd economic change.
Theopple of China could well choose a government less free but more
predictable than America's---and prosper in the choice. Aa
mnaetruicrally believes such a system is unsustainable. Not only would
China have to impose it by force on free societies, but it is
susceptible to corrosion from within. This is often mentioned in
conjunction with the fact that nearly 150,000 Chinese students study at
American universities each year. In Fukuyaman terms, education offers a
path to China becoming part of the American order. Amer- ican policy
encourages the practice in the belief that while Chinese may not return
home hoping their teenage daughters behave as American teenagers do,
they surely want a government they can hold accountable. And if a
government is accountable, then it will become liberal. But if the
Chinese dream proves magnetic, America will have educated the political,
economic, and military leaders that occasion its demise. American
government during the country's rise to prominence was not liberal. The
government became liberal in conjunction with prosperity and power, and
it could be argued that America's liber- ality was practiced to a
greater extent in its foreign policy than in remaining true to its creed
at home. The Fukuyaman mind-set takes as causality the increased
liberalism of America; it may have simply been correlation. The Lockean
liberal ethos is so fully embedded in American he- gemony, though, that
it is difficult to imagine the United States re- fusing admission to
Chinese students. Indeed, liberalism may so far pervade American
political culture that courts would deny gov- ernment the ability to
proscribe university admissions on national security grounds. While
conservatives bemoan the preoccupations of liberal societies, they are
the defiennint gofeltehme American brand and the seemingly inescapable
basis for American foreign policy in the time of its hegemony. The
American order will succeed or fail along Fukuyaman lines: either the
United States will prove reigeht that people and free markets are the
sole basis for sustain- able prosperity and political power, and China
will either fail to continue rising or become indistinguishable from
other states in the American order, or China will prove resistant to the
attractions of liberalism and overtake America as hegemon. [If the
Chinese model sustains itself, then a dominant China is likely to recast
the rules in ways that extrapolate to the international order its
domestic political ideology, just as America did. Hegemony with Chinese
characteristics would be a very different international order from the
one America has fostered in its hegemony. It would encourage and support
other authoritarian governments politically, financially, and socially.
It would penalize states for interfering in the internal practices of
repressive governments. It would offer priv- ileged access to
state-associated commercial concerns. It would prevent market forces
levying penalties that make markets efficient and reliable allocators of
capital. China lacks an ideology likely to appeal to America in the
seductive way America's ideology appealed within Britain and beyond.
Without such an ideology, **any hegemonic transition will require
imposition by force.**]{.underline}

#### The idea that US power in Europe leads Russia to lash out is illogical and incompatible with realism

[Focusing on U.S. idealism **ignores** Russia's own agency]{.underline}.
In his latest article, FP columnist Stephen Walt traces the sources of
the Russia-Ukraine crisis to a single cause: American arrogance. [The
conflict would not have happened, he writes, "had the United States and
its European allies not succumbed to hubris, wishful thinking, and
liberal idealism." By overplaying its hand, the United States has now
put Russia in a position where it has no choice but to defend its
interests. Realists are sometimes criticized for ignoring weaker states'
agency, but Walt takes the argument to its **absurd conclusion** by
denying the agency of everyone but U.S. policymakers]{.underline}. It's
U.S. officials who make the choices that matter---bad ones---while the
rest of the world, Russian President Vladimir Putin included, are simply
enacting the eternal laws of history. This is not just an academic
dispute about isms. It's a question about how Russia and the United
States got into this situation and what to do about it. During the Cold
War, debates raged about who was to blame for starting the conflict
between the superpowers. To simplify a complex set of arguments, answers
fell into three categories: traditionalists, who blamed the Soviet
Union; revisionists, who blamed the United States; and
post-revisionists, who blamed not a particular side's actions but the
uncertainty and mutual suspicion created by the anarchy of international
politics. Policymakers are now rehashing these debates, but instead of
asking who started the Cold War, the question has become who reignited
it. [Walt takes the equivalent of the revisionist side---America did it,
period.]{.underline} Doing so makes sense as a counterargument to
conventional Washington wisdom---that Putin did it, period. This
view---while refusing to treat the United States as anything but a force
of good---has contributed to foreign-policy blunders in Afghanistan and
Iraq, so it's understandable that Walt would push against it. It would
be nice to have more voices in the foreign-policy establishment doing
the same. [But by placing blame on one state, Walt has **robbed his
argument** of the strategic context that realists themselves correctly
love to emphasize.]{.underline} [As a result, focusing on the United
States doesn't just ignore the role played by others but **contradicts**
Walt's own theory.]{.underline} Realists argue that regional powers
always seek primacy in their neighborhood. [According to this logic, a
recovering Russia would seek to reestablish regional hegemony regardless
of U.S. actions.]{.underline} Western accommodation would have only sped
up the process. [It's **incoherent** for Walt to claim that liberal
illusions caused the Russia crisis while also arguing that regional
powers naturally seek control over their neighborhood. The rise in
tensions would be expected unless **Washington abandoned all interest**
in the region. This **incoherence** extends to explaining Putin's
motivations. A key realist principle is that states should not go to war
unless it serves their national interests.]{.underline} This is why
realists have admirably opposed U.S. adventurism in Vietnam, Iraq, and
elsewhere, noting that none of these places ever posed a threat to the
United States. If you want to invade, you better have a good reason.
[But such high standards for starting a conflict disappear when applied
to other regimes. What national interest do realists think Putin is
defending by escalating this crisis? What is the existential threat he
faces that justifies war and tens of thousands of casualties? Even if
NATO is a worry, it's **hard to credibly portray it an as immediate
danger**, especially since Russia's concerns center on an expansion that
hasn't happened and doesn't look likely to happen. If you argue that
Putin is merely reacting to Western pressures and his reaction is
understandable and expected, you are also arguing that his decision to
wage war is justified on realist grounds. Which is, sorry to say, a
**questionable** way to explain a war of choice, **fabricated and
pursued** for reasons unknown.\]{.underline}

So in what way might the United States have provoked Putin? One thing
needs to be clear: [it was **not by threatening** the **security** of
Russia. Since the end of the Cold War, the Russians have **objectively
enjoyed greater security** than at any time in recent
memory.]{.underline} Russia was invaded three times over the past two
centuries, once by France and twice by Germany. During the Cold War,
Soviet forces were perpetually ready to battle U.S. and NATO forces in
Europe. Yet [since the end of the Cold War, Russia has enjoyed
unprecedented security on its western flanks, **even as NATO has taken
in new members** to its east.]{.underline} Moscow even welcomed what was
in many ways the most significant addition to the alliance: a reunified
Germany. When Germany was reunifying at the end of the Cold War, the
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev favored anchoring it in NATO. As he told
U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, he believed that the best guarantee
of Soviet and Russian security was a Germany \"contained within European
structures.\"

Late Soviet and early [Russian leaders certainly did not act as if they
feared an attack from the West. Soviet and Russian defense **spending
declined sharply** in the late 1980s and through the late 1990s,
including by **90 percent** between 1992 and 1996. The once formidable
Red Army was cut nearly in half]{.underline}, leaving it weaker in
relative terms than it had been for almost 400 years. Gorbachev even
ordered the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Poland and other Warsaw
Pact states, chiefly as a costsaving measure. It was all part of a
larger strategy to ease Cold War tensions so that Moscow might
concentrate on economic reform at home. But even Gorbachev would not
have sought this holiday from geopolitics had he believed that the
United States and the West would take advantage of it.

Now Russian officials, and even President Vladimir Putin himself, have
echoed --- and sometimes directly cited --- American [scholars such as
political scientist John Mearsheimer, who argues that the current crisis
"is the West's fault."]{.underline} The "blame NATO" argument tells a
story of hubris, arrogance and tragedy. It holds that there was a golden
chance for lasting peace in Europe, but the US threw it all away. Rather
than conciliating a defeated rival, Washington repeatedly humiliated it
by expanding a vast military alliance up to Russia's borders and even
into the former Soviet Union. This pursuit of **[American
hegemony]{.underline}** in a liberal-democratic guise eventually
provoked a violent rebuke. In this telling, Putin's wars against Georgia
and Ukraine are just the natural response of one great power whose vital
interests are being heedlessly threatened by another. The argument isn't
wholly wrong. Putin's wars are indeed meant, in part, to push Western
influence back from Russia's frontiers. But [the idea that]{.underline}
NATO [expansion is the root of today's problems is **morally and
geopolitically bizarre**.]{.underline} Far from being a historic
blunder, [NATO expansion was one of the great American successes of the
post-Cold War era. Far from being the act of a domineering superpower,
it was part of a long tradition of vulnerable states begging to join
America's liberal empire.]{.underline} And far from posing a mortal
threat to Moscow, NATO [enlargement actually provided Russia with far
**greater security** than it could have provided itself.]{.underline}
NATO was founded in 1949 with 12 members in Western Europe and North
America. It gradually added additional states --- Turkey, Greece, West
Germany, Spain --- over the course of the Cold War. But the big bang of
enlargement came once the superpower conflict ended. NATO incorporated
the former East Germany into the alliance in 1990; it then added three
Eastern European countries (Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic) in
1999; then seven more, including the Baltic states, in 2004. To
understand why NATO grew so rapidly, we have to remember something that
nearly everyone has now forgotten: [There was no guarantee that Europe
would be mostly stable, peaceful and democratic after the Cold
War.]{.underline} In fact, many of the analysts who now view NATO
expansion as a catastrophe once warned that a post-Cold War Europe could
become a violent hellscape. It wasn't an outlandish scenario. A
reunified Germany might once again try to dominate its neighbors; the
old enmity between Moscow and Berlin could reignite. The collapse of
Soviet influence in Eastern Europe could liberate those states to pursue
long-suppressed territorial claims and nationalist agendas. Ethnic
tensions and nuclear proliferation might explode as the Cold War order
crumbled. [If the US pulled back once the Soviet threat was gone, there
would be no]{.underline} extra-European [superpower to put out fires on
a continent with lots of geopolitical kindling. "The prospect of major
crises, **even wars**, in Europe is likely to increase dramatically,"
Mearsheimer predicted in 1990.]{.underline} NATO [enlargement was the
logical answer]{.underline} to these fears. Expansion was a way of
binding a reunified Germany to the West and surrounding it with
democratic allies. Joining NATO required new members to lay aside any
revanchist designs, while allowing them to pursue economic and political
reforms rather than investing heavily in military capabilities to defend
their newly won autonomy. NATO's [move to the east also ensured that
Poland and other states that easily could have built nuclear weapons
didn't need to, because they had **America**n protection]{.underline}.
[Most important, enlargement kept the US firmly planted in Europe, by
preventing the centerpiece of the transatlantic relationship from
becoming obsolete.]{.underline} No other initiative could have
accomplished these objectives. Partnership for Peace --- a series of
loose security cooperation agreements with former Soviet-bloc states ---
didn't offer the ironclad guarantees that came with NATO membership. (If
you want to understand the difference between "security partner" and
"NATO ally," just look at what is happening today to Ukraine, one of the
former.) The idea of creating a pan-European security architecture (one
that included Russia) had the same defect; plus, it would have given
Moscow veto power over the security arrangements of the countries the
Soviet Union had so recently dominated. [**Only American power** and
promises could provide stability in Europe, and NATO was the continent's
critical link to the US. Since 1949, Washington had tamped down
rivalries between old enemies such as France and Germany, while also
protecting them from external threats.]{.underline} After 1991, NATO
expansion took this zone of peace, prosperity and cooperation that had
emerged in Western Europe and moved it into Eastern Europe as well. The
revolutionary nature of this achievement seemed obvious not so long ago.
["Why has Europe been so peaceful since 1989?" Mearsheimer asked in
2010. The answer, he acknowledged, was because "America has continued to
serve as Europe's pacifier," protecting the continent from dangers
within and without.]{.underline} Today, of course, the critics don't buy
this account. They argue that NATO expansion represented crude power
politics, as the US exploited the Soviet collapse to engorge its own
empire. What resulted, pundits such as Thomas Friedman contend, was a
sort of Weimar Russia --- a country whose dignity was affronted,
security imperiled and democracy undermined by a harsh, humiliating
peace. There is a kernel of truth here, too. Once Russian democracy
began to wobble in 1993-94, officials in the Bill Clinton administration
saw NATO expansion --- in part --- as a way of preventing a potentially
resurgent, aggressive Russia from rebuilding the Soviet sphere of
influence. Russian leaders of all stripes griped about NATO expansion
from the early 1990s onward, warning that it could jeopardize the peace
of the continent. In hindsight, NATO expansion was one of several issues
--- including disputes over the Balkans and the collapse of the Russian
economy in the late 1990s --- that gradually soured Russia's
relationship with the West. Yet this story omits three vital facts.
First, all policies have costs. The price of NATO expansion was a
certain alienation of Russian elites --- although we often forget that
Clinton softened the blow by continually courting Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, bringing Russia into elite Western institutions such as
the Group of Seven, and making Moscow a partner in the intervention in
Bosnia in 1995-96. Yet the cost of not expanding NATO might have been
forfeiting much of the stability that initiative provided. Trade-offs
are inevitable in foreign policy: There was no magic middle path that
would have provided all the benefits with none of the costs. Second, [if
NATO expansion was a manifestation of American empire, it was a
**remarkably benign** and consensual form of empire.]{.underline} When
Clinton decided to pursue enlargement, he did so at the urging of the
Poles, Czechs and Hungarians. The Baltic countries and others were soon
banging at the door. T[he states of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union were desperate to join America's sphere of influence, because they
were desperate to leave Moscow's.]{.underline} This, too, was part of an
older pattern: [The US has often extended its influence by "invitation"
rather than imposition.]{.underline} The creation of NATO in 1949 was
mostly a European idea: [Countries that were terrified of Moscow sought
protection from Washington.]{.underline} One reason Putin's wars to keep
countries from escaping Moscow's empire are so abhorrent to Americans is
that the US empire has trouble keeping members out. Putin may not see it
that way. All that matters to him is that the mightiest peacetime
alliance in history has crept closer to Russian soil. But here a third
fact becomes relevant: [Russia was one of the biggest beneficiaries of
NATO's move east.]{.underline} Open terrain has often left Russia
vulnerable to invasion and instability emanating from Europe. Napoleonic
France, Imperial Germany and Nazi Germany all swept through Eastern
Europe to wreak havoc on Russian or Soviet territory. This is one reason
why the great strategist George Kennan opposed NATO expansion ---
because it would surely re-activate this fear of encroachment from the
west. Yet this was a red herring, because NATO posed no military threat.
The alliance committed, in 1997, not to permanently station foreign
troops in Eastern Europe. After the Cold War, America steadily withdrew
most of its troops and all of its heavy armor from the continent. US
allies engaged in a veritable race to disarm. The prospect that NATO
could invade Russia, even had it wanted to, was laughable. What the
alliance could do was tame the perils that might otherwise have menaced
the Russian state. Germany could hardly threaten Russia: It was nestled
snugly into an alliance that also served as a strategic straitjacket.
NATO, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev had candidly said in 1990, could
"play a containing role" vis-à-vis Berlin. Moscow didn't have to worry
about a nuclear Poland --- Warsaw didn't need nukes because it had the
protection of the United States. Aside from the Balkan wars of the
1990s, Eastern Europe was comparatively free of the geopolitical
intrigues and military quarrels that might have made Russia jumpy. NATO
expansion hadn't just alleviated Europe's security problems; it had
protected Russia's vital interests as well. Moscow might have lost an
empire, but it had gained remarkable safety from external attack. Part
of the answer is that NATO expansion wasn't really the problem, in the
sense that Russia didn't need that pretext to seek renewed hegemony in
its near-abroad. The Soviet Union, and the Russian empire before it, had
traditionally sought to control countries along their frontiers and used
brutal means to do it. To say that NATO expansion caused Russian
belligerence is thus to make an extremely dubious assertion: that absent
NATO expansion, Moscow would have been a satisfied, status quo power.
And this is exactly why a bigger NATO has posed a real problem for
Putin. After all, safety from external attack isn't the only thing that
states and rulers want. They want glory, greatness and the privileges of
empire. For 20 years, Putin has been publicly lusting after the sphere
of influence that the Soviet Union once enjoyed. NATO expansion stood
athwart that ambition, by giving Moscow's former vassals the ability to
resist its pressure. NATO also threatened a certain type of Russian
government --- an autocracy that was never secure in its own rule. A
democratic Russia wouldn't so much have minded being neighbors with
Western-leaning democracies, because political liberty in those
countries wouldn't have threatened to set a subversive example for
anti-Putin Russians. Yet, as Russia became more autocratic in the early
2000s, and as Putin's popularity declined with the Russian economy after
2008, the imperative of preventing ideological spillover from a
US-backed democratic community loomed large. So Putin began pushing back
against NATO's eastward march. In 2008, he invaded Georgia, a country
that was moving --- too slowly for its own safety --- toward the West.
Since 2014, he has been waging war against Ukraine, in hopes of
rebuilding the Russian empire and halting Kiev's westward drift.
America's vision of Europe has now run into Putin's program of violent
coercion. To be sure, US officials made mistakes along the way. Because
Russia was prostrate, militarily and economically, during the 1990s,
Washington acquired a bad habit of issuing security guarantees without
really considering how it would fulfill them in a crisis. The Pentagon
has thus been scrambling, since 2014, to devise a credible defense of
NATO's eastern flank. As Russia regained its strength, US officials also
failed to grasp the danger of provoking Putin without adequately
deterring him. When, in 2008, NATO declined to endorse membership for
Georgia and Ukraine but issued a vague statement saying that they would
someday join the alliance, it created the worst of all worlds --- giving
Putin both the pretext and the time to pre-empt future expansion by
tearing those two countries apart. Yet there is a curious morality in
accounts that blame the West, which sought to protect vulnerable states
in Eastern Europe, for the current carnage, rather than blaming Putin,
who has worked to dismember and intimidate those countries. It is sloppy
thinking to tally up the costs of NATO expansion without considering the
historic achievements of a policy that served American, European and
even certain Russian interests remarkably well. And if nothing else,
NATO expansion pushed the dividing line between Moscow and the
democratic world to the east after one Cold War --- a factor of great
significance now that a second cold war is underway. The legacy of NATO
expansion isn't simply a matter of historical interest. Americans'
understanding of the past has always influenced their view of what
policies to pursue in the future. During the 1920s and 1930s, the
widespread, if inaccurate, belief that America had entered World War I
to serve the interests of banks and arms manufacturers had a paralyzing
effect on US policy amid the totalitarian aggression that set off World
War II. [Today, the US faces a long, nasty struggle to contain Putin's
imperial project and protect an **endangered world order**]{.underline}.
Introspection is an admirable quality, but [the last thing America needs
is another bout of self-flagellation rooted in another misapprehension
of the past.]{.underline}

[Blaming America first became all **too easy**]{.underline}. After
September 11, U.S. power was as overwhelming as it was uncontested. That
it was squandered on two endless wars made it convenient [to focus on
America's sins, while **underplaying Russia's and China's growing
ambitions**.]{.underline} For his part, Putin understood well that the
balance of power was shifting[. Knowing what he knew, the Russian
president wasn't necessarily "irrational" in deciding to invade Ukraine.
He had good reason to think that he could get away with it. After all,
he had gotten away with quite a lot for nearly 15 years, ever since the
Russian war against Georgia in 2008, when George W. Bush was still
president.]{.underline} Then he annexed Crimea in 2014 and intervened
brutally in Syria in 2015. Each time, in an understandable desire to
avoid an escalatory spiral with Russia, the United States held back and
tried not to do anything that might provoke Putin. Meanwhile, Europe
became more and more dependent on Russian energy; Germany, for example,
was importing 55% of its natural gas from Russia. Just three weeks ago,
it was possible for Der Spiegel to declare that most Germans thought
"peace with Russia is the only thing that matters." The narrative of a
feckless and divided West solidified for years. We, as Americans, were
feeling unsure of ourselves, so it was only reasonable that Putin would
feel it too. [In such a context, and after four years of Donald Trump
and the domestic turmoil that he wrought, it was **tempting to valorize
"restraint"** and limited engagements abroad. Worried about imperial
overreach, most of the American left opposed direct U.S. military action
against Bashar Assad's regime in the early 2010s, even though it was
**Russian and Iranian intervention** on behalf of Syria's dictator that
bore the marks of a real imperial enterprise, not just an imagined one.
Russia's unprovoked attack on a sovereign nation, in Europe no less, has
put matters back in their proper framing. The question of whether the
United States is a uniquely malevolent force in global politics has been
resolved. In the span of a few days, skeptics of American power have
**gotten a taste of what a world where America grows weak and Russia
grows strong looks like**.]{.underline} Of course, there are still
holdouts who insist on seeing the United States as the provocateur. In
its only public statement on Ukraine, the Democratic Socialists of
America condemned Russia's invasion but also called for "the U.S. to
withdraw from NATO and to end the imperialist expansionism that set the
stage for this conflict." [This is an odd statement considering that
**Russia**, rather than the United States, has been the world's most
**unabashedly imperialist force** for the past three decades. But many
on the anti-imperialist left aren't really anti-imperialist; they just
have an instinctive aversion to American power.]{.underline} America's
low opinion of its own capacity for good --- and the resulting desire to
retreat or disengage --- hasn't just been a preoccupation of the far
left. The crisis of confidence has been pervasive, spreading to the
halls of power and even President Barack Obama, whose memorable mantra
was "Don't do stupid sh\*t." Instead of thinking about what we could do,
or what we could do better, Obama was more interested in a self-limiting
principle. For their part, European powers --- content to bask under
their U.S. security umbrella --- could afford to believe in fantasies of
perpetual peace. Europe's gentleness and lethargy --- coaxing Germany to
commit even 2% of its GDP to defense seemed impossible --- became
something of a joke. One popular Twitter account, \@ISEUConcerned,
devoted itself to mocking the European Union's propensity to express
"concern," but do little else, whenever something bad happened.
Suddenly, the EU has been aroused from its slumber, and the parody
account was rendered temporarily speechless. This is no longer tepid
concern, but righteous fury. Member states announced that they would
send anti-tank weapons to Ukraine. Germany, for the first time, said
that it would ramp up its military budget to 100 billion euros. On the
economic front, the EU announced some of the toughest sanctions in
history. My podcast co-host, Damir Marusic, an Atlantic Council senior
fellow, likened it to a "holy war," European-style. Sometimes, unusual
and extreme events mark the separation between old and new ways of
thinking and being. This week, the Berlin-based journalist Elizabeth
Zerofsky remarked that the current moment reminded her of the memoir
"The World of Yesterday," written by the Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig
as World War II loomed. In it, he recalls the twilight of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire with an almost naive fondness. On the first day
of the Ukraine invasion, I happened to be speaking to a group of college
students who had no memory of September 11. I told them that they may be
living in history. Those students, like all of us, are bearing witness
to one of those rare events that recast how individuals and nations
alike view the world they inhabit. The coming weeks, months, and years
are likely to be as fascinating as they are terrifying. In a sense, we
knew that a great confrontation was coming, even if we hadn't quite
envisioned its precise contours. At the start of his presidency, Joe
Biden declared that the battle between democracies and autocracies would
be the defining struggle of our time. This was grandiose rhetoric, but
was it more than that? What does it actually mean to fight such a
battle? [In any number of ways, Russia's aggression has underscored why
Biden was right and why authoritarians --- and the authoritarian idea
itself --- are such a threat to peace and stability. **Russia invaded
Ukraine**, a democracy, **because of the recklessness and domination of
one man, Vladimir Putin.**]{.underline} The countries that have rallied
most enthusiastically behind Ukraine have almost uniformly been
democracies, chief among them the United States. America is lousy,
disappointing, and maddeningly hypocritical in its conduct abroad, but
[the notion of any moral equivalence between the United States and
Putin's Russia has been **rendered laughable**. And if there is such a
thing as a better world, then **anti-imperialists may find themselves in
the odd** position of hoping and praying for the health and longevity of
not just the West but of Western power.]{.underline}

When the doyen of foreign policy gurus, Henry Kissinger, is hinting that
Ukraine should cede territory to Russia to help end the invasion, you
know in your stomach that [the West is about to make another major
mistake.]{.underline} At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Kissinger
also urged western countries not to seek an embarrassing [defeat for
Russia in Ukraine]{.underline}, warning it [could endanger Europe's
long-term stability.]{.underline} He seems to be focused on
Europe-Russia relations in the longer term, considering that for four
centuries, [Russia has been an essential part of Europe and a factor in
re-establishing its balance.]{.underline} Just 50 years after former US
President Richard Nixon's historic trip to China, Kissinger's ultimate
concern is to avoid driving Moscow into a permanent alliance with
Beijing. It is too late for that. As for the [Russian
economy]{.underline}, it is certainly [suffering]{.underline}, but -
contrary to what was confidently predicted months ago - it [has not
collapsed]{.underline} In an ideal world, Kissinger's solemn warnings
would sound alarm bells, prompting European chancelleries - which have
followed a script on the Russia-Ukraine war that was hastily drafted in
Washington and London - to at least review their overall strategy. They
could ask themselves what "winning" looks like for Ukraine, rather than
simply accepting Ukraine's contention that all Russian forces must be
pushed back to the lines of 24 February, which appears increasingly
unlikely. Instead, [the EU has just approved its sixth package of
sanctions]{.underline}, agreeing to reduce Russian oil supplies in a
last-minute compromise that barely conceals the cracks surfacing within
European resoluteness. Nevertheless, the Nato-EU-G7 triad officially
continues to believe that Ukraine's unexpected resistance and the West's
unity in helping it, along with unprecedented sanctions against Russia,
will determine Kyiv's victory and Moscow's economic collapse. Their
"strategists" say more time is needed, and the West should hold its
nerve. Italy's prime minister has said that sanctions will really bite
this summer. We'll see. Major economic test Meanwhile, facts on the
ground show that [Russia, after initial serious military blunders, is
slowly obtaining the upper hand in Donbas, and even media in the West
are starting to admit that the situation is getting
complicated.]{.underline} Ukrainians are losing up to 100 soldiers a
day. As for the Russian economy, it is certainly suffering, but -
contrary to what was confidently predicted months ago - it has not
collapsed. In the words of the International Monetary Fund's managing
director, the conflict in Ukraine is subjecting the global economy to
perhaps its ["biggest test since the Second World War".]{.underline} At
the World Economic Forum in Davos, the stage was carefully set to
reinforce the Ukrainian message, which essentially expels Russia from
the "civilised world". Yet, it remains unclear as to how this
perspective has been welcomed by the world's top business leaders, who
have gathered for decades in the Swiss luxury resort under the motto
"make money, not war". Panelists speak at an event on the sidelines of
the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on 25 May 2022 (AFP)
Davos has been the temple where globalisation and interconnectedness are
preached and celebrated. Should we now believe that its participants
agree that the right move is to cut a global commodities powerhouse off
from the rest of the world economy? Has any reliable economic simulation
been conducted to assess the global impact of such a decision? Probably
not. Are we thus once again watching the US-led bloc of western
democracies sleepwalking towards another miscalculation of unknown
proportions - similar to what we saw in western and central Asia over
the last two decades? Just a month into the conflict and the collateral
damage of sanctions, I wondered who would crash first: Russia or the
global economy, due to the underestimated knock-on consequences. While
the jury is still out on this, the economic data appear worrisome.
[**Global trade war** Supply chain disruptions, food and energy
insecurity, unprecedented inflation, and a major stock market
collapse]{.underline}: this is the menu on offer, after two dramatic
years of the Covid-19 pandemic. Famine could spur new refugee flows from
Africa and the Middle East, a prospect of great concern to the EU. BRICS
and the so-called Global South have shown no desire to join the
sanctions against Russia. Could secondary sanctions against them be
adopted to force them to change their minds? Does the Nato-EU-G7 triad
really want to inflict upon the whole world the bankrupt blueprint it
unsuccessfully applied to Iran over the last four decades?
Russia-Ukraine war: The future of the world is being decided in Beijing
Is the Davos crowd keen to move from a globalised and interconnected
world to conflicting trading blocs, or even a global trade war? What
would happen if, after Russia, the US goes after China, as Secretary of
State Antony Blinken recently outlined in a comprehensive speech at the
Asia Society? American voters could soon be wondering why the Biden
administration pushed Congress to approve, in a matter of months, \$54bn
in aid to Ukraine, while the US struggles to provide formula to its
newborns amid soaring inflation. The Democratic Party risks being
decimated in November's midterm elections. [Nobody really knows what
Washington's endgame is in Ukraine. If it is Russia's defeat, this
sounds unrealistic. If it is denying President Vladimir Putin a sound
victory, this is difficult to define. If it is creating facts on the
ground to improve Kyiv's negotiating leverage - as recently leaked US
National Security Council documents indicate - this is possible, but
with high costs and unpredictable outcomes.]{.underline} Western double
standards The main problem is that the [Nato]{.underline}-EU-G7 triad,
in yet another moment of cognitive dissonance, [has framed the war as an
apocalyptic and existential struggle between democracy and
autocracy.]{.underline} BRICS and the Global South are not buying it,
nor is the narrative fully shared among western public opinion. Contrary
to the triad's spin efforts, there is a growing feeling that **[the
biggest threats to democracy are not China and Russia, but the western
neoliberal model's failure of governance and deep
inequalities.]{.underline}** Put simply, there have been [broad
inconsistencies between the words western democracies have uttered in
recent decades, and the actions they have taken.]{.underline} They ought
to ask themselves what the US represents today; on what are they still
placing their hopes? [Russia and China certainly represent a problem for
the US-led rules-based world order.]{.underline} But this same order has
progressively lost its credibility through endless wars and double
standards, and by conveying the clear sense that such rules have always
been valid for all but the US and its closest allies. [The discourse
about freedom and human rights sounds increasingly unconvincing when
western allies violate it at will.]{.underline} BRICS and the Global
South are reluctant to accept that it is the West's exclusive
prerogative to make the rules around which a new world order is based.
Unfortunately, US President Joe Biden and his close allies truly believe
that this must be the case. In March, Biden said: ["Now is a time when
things are shifting. We're going to - there's going to be a new world
order out there, and **we've got to lead** it."]{.underline} The bare
truth is that [Washington]{.underline}, regardless of its official
rhetoric, [rejects a multipolar world. It clings to its global
hegemony]{.underline}, brazenly established by the so-called Wolfowitz
Doctrine in the early 1990s. [But]{.underline} in the last 30 years,
[the world has changed.]{.underline} Expanding Nato After the Trump era,
European countries breathed a sigh of relief over Biden's slogan,
"America is back". They ought to ask themselves what the US represents
today; on what are they still placing their hopes? One of the wisest
American diplomats, Chas Freeman, recently noted: ["\[American\]
politics are polarised and dysfunctional, we are in a chronic fiscal
deficit, our infrastructure is collapsing, our educational system is
increasingly mediocre, our social fabric is fraying, our international
prestige is declining, and we are more divided internally than at any
time since our civil war. We appear to have achieved herd immunity to
strategic reasoning."]{.underline} The topic of a possible new American
civil war is no longer taboo. Judging from his claimed intentions of
reforming his country, Biden might be good for the US; less so for the
rest of the world. The facts, unfortunately, speak for themselves.
Ukrainian soldiers stand on a tank near Bakhmut on 15 May 2022 (AFP)
Having ignored caution and pushed for Nato's eastward expansion, the
[US]{.underline}, through a process that has apparently been ongoing for
the last eight years, [has emboldened, supplied and effectively trained
Ukraine's armed forces. The net result was the failure of the Minsk II
agreement, paving the way for the wretched and bloody Russian
invasion.]{.underline} The discomforting impression is that Washington,
London and some eastern European capitals seem determined to fight for
Russia's collapse, down to the last Ukrainian soldier and European
consumer. [Washington has now even taken the escalatory measure of
delivering long-range rockets to Ukraine, which could potentially allow
it to **strike Russian territory.**]{.underline} Does this strategy
really suit Europe's interests? Power at any cost Washington also seems
to be on a confrontation path with China. During a recent visit to
Japan, [Biden vowed to militarily defend Taiwan in the event of a
Chinese threat. This is a guarantee that no US president has ever issued
before]{.underline}, and one that undermines four decades of US-Chinese
discourse on this delicate topic. Blinken, in presenting the Biden
administration's strategy towards China, asserted that "even as
President Putin's war continues, we will remain focused on the most
serious long-term challenge to the international order - and that's
posed by the People's Republic of China". At the same time, [the chances
for a renewed nuclear deal with Iran appear to have almost
disappeared.]{.underline} The US will not remove a symbolic listing of
Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps from the State Department's
terrorist entities list, as requested by Tehran, even though the
organisation would regardless still be sanctioned by the US Treasury. As
a consequence, Iran could soon reach the nuclear threshold, with all the
imaginable consequences. [The US seems determined to maintain its global
hegemony **at any cost**, and to maintain or re-establish - on its own -
the rules-based world order. This ambition may ultimately deliver its
coup de grace.]{.underline}

The [Biden administration has formulated an unprecedented response to
Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The coordination of transatlantic
diplomacy, including the condemnation of Russia at the United Nations
and the implementation of a massive sanctions package, is truly
impressive.]{.underline} The president's recent request for an
additional \$33 billion from Congress in security, economic, and
humanitarian aid for Ukraine demonstrates the seriousness of America's
commitment to European security. While the White House should be
applauded for its response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine, this only
tells part of the story. Indeed, none of these diplomatic initiatives
would have been necessary had the United States and its allies
successfully deterred Russia from attacking Ukraine in the first place.
[Deterrence failed because the United States and its allies signaled, in
advance, that it was not prepared to apply direct military force in
Ukraine. It did so because it was afraid of Vladimir Putin's nuclear
threats. America's risk calculus was framed by the fear of nuclear
escalation and Washington's overestimation of Russian military
power.]{.underline} While initial efforts to deter Russia have failed,
[the West should now pursue a different approach.]{.underline} [Rather
than deterrence, **the United States should focus on compellence**. A
comprehensive compellence strategy toward Russia would entail the
focused integration of covert and overt military power, as well as a
greater efforts to conduct information operations inside Russia to
weaken Putin's fragile political control. The goal of such a strategy
could be to force Putin to stop the war]{.underline}, not merely help
Ukraine stave off defeat. It strives to achieve this [by raising costs
to Moscow beyond sanctions and political isolation.]{.underline} [The
strategy would help the West coalesce around the objective of ending the
war in the near term, but also forcing a negotiated conclusion to
hostilities that would be more advantageous to Ukrainian and Western
interests.]{.underline} The West's aim should be to ensure Putin suffers
an operational failure, not accede to Russia's subjugation of Ukraine or
some tortured negotiated compromise. The Need for Compellence [Ukraine
has]{.underline}, thus far, [been brilliant in asymmetric
tactics]{.underline} with creative applications of modern tools of
warfare. Nevertheless, [Russian forces have destroyed much of Ukraine's
infrastructure]{.underline}, while roughly 25 percent of the nation's
population is displaced and hungry. [**Without support from the United
States** and the West, **Ukraine** may still be **unable to prevent
Russia from achieving its** new **goals**]{.underline}, which likely
include seizing the entire southern coast of Ukraine, including Odessa.
With the opening of the new phase of the war in Donbas and the Black Sea
coastline, [both sides of the conflict are now engaged in a race of
strategic and operational adaptation.]{.underline} The coming battles
will be on different terrain, and require altered tactics and weapons
than the initial fighting around Kyiv. [This will be a very different
battlefield and the results are not preordained. Which side learns
faster and altered its strategy and force employment best will determine
the course of this war]{.underline} in the second phase. The Elements of
Comprehensive Compellence One month before the war started, FPRI's Rob
Lee argued that Moscow's compellence strategy would include the use of
military force directly against Kyiv or more likely by punitive raids
deep into the eastern half of Ukraine. He argued, "By inflicting heavy
losses on the Ukrainian military, taking prisoners of war, and degrading
Kyiv's defense capabilities, Russia could potentially alter Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelensky's incentive structure sufficiently to
induce painful concessions." Despite Ukraine's successful effort to turn
back Russian forces around Kyiv, [Russia's **compellence** strategy
**has not** yet **failed.** As a result, it needs to be undercut by NATO
with a more comprehensive approach. A robust U.S. counter to Moscow,
what might be called **comprehensive compellence, would** build on the
administration's defense strategy concept of integrated deterrence to
**get Putin to alter his misguided effort in Ukraine.**]{.underline}
Compellence is normally a harder task historically than deterrence, but
given Russia's dysfunctional military effectiveness, the cost-benefit
analysis for compellence in this case augurs for success. Deterrence and
compellence share some common elements but are conceptually distinct.
Deterrence seeks to persuade an adversary to not to take some action
that it is capable of. On the other hand, compellence is an effort to
persuade the opponent to stop some behavior or change its course due to
the threat of coercive force or via incentives. [Compellence is often
needed in the wake of deterrence failure.]{.underline} [While America's
efforts to deter a Russian invasion of Ukraine failed, a compellence
strategy would have a greater chance of success.]{.underline} After
Russia's inept military campaign and Ukraine's effective resistance,
[**the balance of power now favors the United States** and its
allies.]{.underline} Russian losses on the battlefield and degraded
economic strength due to sanctions make the military components of a
Western compellence strategy even more credible. A strategy of
comprehensive [compellence]{.underline} in support of Ukraine [would
have **five elements**]{.underline} or lines of effort. **[Diplomatic
and political]{.underline}** This element is already [being aggressively
pursued by]{.underline} the [Biden]{.underline} administration [in its
political and economic isolation of Russia and its leaders. It has
successfully made Putin a pariah in most circles]{.underline}, although
China, India, and some other states are taking a different approach. The
European Union and NATO have been energized and coordinated brilliantly.
Efforts similar to the removal of Russia from the U.N. Human Rights
Council should be pursued, including the forthcoming G20 meeting this
year. In any event, after a year or two of sanctions, [Russia may be
functionally dismissed from the G20]{.underline} entirely depending upon
the price of oil and natural gas. In terms of a new initiative, [Finland
and Sweden should be offered swift approval of their applications for
membership in NATO.]{.underline} While their applications are under
consideration by NATO's 30 member states, the United Kingdom and United
States should offer Finland and Sweden immediate security guarantees to
protect them from Russian threats. The application process has
historically taken over a year, and Russia will undoubtedly apply
coercive pressure against the applicants. Additionally, former Finnish
Prime Minister Alexander Stubb should be made a NATO official with a
chance to become the next secretary general when Jens Stoltenberg's term
ends in 2023. The North Atlantic Council might consider Amb. (ret.) Ivo
Daldler's proposal to admit Ukraine now. However, this would be resisted
by key NATO members, and should be left to the final negotiations.
**[Informational]{.underline}** The ongoing war has stressed the
importance of strategic communications, and [Zelensky has proven to be
extremely effective in the battle of narratives. Moscow has employed its
usual playbook of disinformation and propaganda]{.underline}, but to
little discernable effect in Europe and North America. [Russia continues
to apply its concept of information confrontation against NATO and
Ukraine. It persistently seeks to exploit identified vulnerabilities of
democratic societies using cyber and information operations. Russia's
goal is to exacerbate existing]{.underline} societal, political, and
military [divisions.]{.underline} Key targets of this approach are the
legitimacy of Ukraine's government and NATO cohesion. Putin has been
outdone by the determined and savvy Zelenskyy in this dimension of the
conflict. However, Putin's efforts gain more purchase in China, in
democratic states like India, and parts of Africa. [Efforts to pierce
the fog of disinformation inside Russia should be
intensified.]{.underline} There are few sources for independent news
inside the country, but a few techniques seem to still be working.
Ukraine has taken a macabre approach with facial recognition technology
to identify and contact the families of fallen Russian soldiers to
inform them of the fate of their loved one. They have also constructed
websites for families to gain information on the status of their family
members fighting against Ukraine, and at the same time receive some
perspective on the scale of the war that Moscow hides from its own
citizens. In Kyiv, the Information Strategies Council of Ukraine, a
coalition of activists and think tanks, sent emails and social media
messages directly to 15 million Russian men of draft age. It has also
targeted older Russians with different tailored messages, using
historical references to stimulate a questioning of Moscow-generated
news reports and propaganda. [NATO and the European Union need to create
the capacity to design and conduct an information offensive into Russia
and overwhelm Putin's control of information.]{.underline} Putin seems
to be afraid of "fifth columns" at home. That vulnerability should be
exploited more. [The U.S. Global Engagement Center has the mission to
''lead, synchronize, and coordinate efforts of the Federal Government in
countering foreign state and foreign non-state propaganda and
disinformation efforts."]{.underline} It may be a model to build upon,
but it will take a collective effort from European states to establish
an ability to project truth into Russia, and penetrate Putin's dominance
of his domestic information ecosystem. [Russian cyber attacks against
Ukraine have not been effective so far. However, Russian intelligence,
particularly the GRU-supported Sandworm team, are persistently
threatening Ukraine's electricity generation capacity and its power
grid.]{.underline} The Zelensky government is facing an ongoing surge in
cyber activity at present. [The West can do more to support the
Ukrainians in this battlespace with both technical and intelligence
support to ensure that their critical infrastructure is preserved and
functional.]{.underline} The Ukrainians seem to be holding their own
despite Russia's presumed cyber dominance. [**Military** The principal
military stick in this strategy is supplied by the Ukrainians
themselves, abetted by Western arms.]{.underline} This will have to be
both accelerated and sustained during the next phase which is likely to
involve intensive artillery and missile consumption. [It will also
require mass quantities of supplies]{.underline}, and enough drones to
supplement the limited assets now flown by the Ukrainians. Recently, aid
was increased by another increment. This new tranche of \$800 million
sounds enormous and the material is being delivered at an unprecedented
timeline. Even with the recent presidential request of \$33 billion in
aid from Congress, it may be both inadequate and too late. [More covert
but direct kinetic means will be necessary as this is a war of
considerable attrition.]{.underline} Indirect modes of conflict via
proxy forces are nothing new (e.g., El Salvador, Angola, and Hezbollah
in southern Lebanon). The use of proxy forces has a long history but
also a growing salience in an era of strategic competition. One of the
evolving modes of warfare that is suited for comprehensive compellence
is "surrogate warfare." In this mode of warfare, state's avoid the use
of their own soldiers as the primary bearer of warfare's grave costs,
and delegate it to proxy forces and the use of remotely fielded
technological surrogates to better enable the state to manage the risks
of modern conflict. [They may also employ paramilitary forces for
intelligence support for targeting critical nodes of the attacking
force.]{.underline} For this conflict, [this would mean the a greater
use of allied tools]{.underline} for cyber warfare, greater intelligence
sharing, and more unmanned precision strikes on key Russian operational
centers and critical supply links inside Ukraine. Finally, [NATO's
posture has been prudently enhanced with the deployment of four new NATO
battlegroups]{.underline} in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia.
More needs to be done to prepare for cross-border contingencies. NATO
should posture one or two division-plus sized forces outside Ukraine in
case peacekeeping or armed humanitarian intervention is needed. One can
anticipate that human security and disaster relief operations may be
needed in short order given the scale of the destruction of Ukrainian
energy, medical, and water supplies. [**Economic** America and its
allies have implemented a massive sanctions package against
Russia.]{.underline} As a result, [Russian finances may soon be in
default and its economy could nosedive.]{.underline} More attention
should be paid to Russia's energy exports. As FPRI's Chris Miller notes
"if you want to hit Russia hard, you've got to go after energy.
Everything else is really pretty small by comparison." Since there is
little support in some capitals for more intensive sanctions, there may
be value in defining their duration and the conditions for tempering
them. Some have proposed that the West continue sanctions for as long as
Putin remains in power. In essence, this is a call for regime change.
Such a threat may not achieve much in real terms but it carries some
risk since it directly challenges the Kremlin's principal power center.
It is highly unlikely to be accepted by German or French leaders.
[A]{.underline} more [strategic approach would be to keep sanctions
remain in place until Russian forces have departed all agreed
territories and military commanders are turned in to appropriate
authorities.]{.underline} Comprehensive compellence should also include
funding for Ukraine's restoration. The Economist estimates the
reconstruction tab for Ukraine at \$200--520 billion. As some scholars
have recently written, rather than simply freeze Russia's hard currency
reserves in Western banks, those currency reserves should be liquidated
and put to use. These assets should be collected and transferred to the
International Criminal Court in escrow for reparations. The West should
start proceedings to allot reparations to Kyiv from those funds. This
would communicate to the Russian leadership that every day of
destruction in Ukraine is simply another day of reconstruction in its
future, which Moscow will pay for. Ideally, this might induce them to
stop attacking and terrorizing civilians and operate within the law of
armed conflict. [**Legal** The West should purse indictments at the
International Criminal Court for each division and Army commander whose
area of responsibility is shown to have committed crimes against
humanity and other violations of international law.]{.underline}
Washington should also do the same for corporate and unit leaders of the
Wagner Group, the mercenaries purportedly behind the Bucha massacre.
Judicial proceedings may be far off, but the intent to prosecute needs
to be clear now.

#### **Reimagined U.S. containment has the ability to check Russian aggression**

Prevail Against the Kremlin", Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-03-01/return-containment\]//AA

[Russia's unprovoked assault on Ukraine did not come as a surprise. The
United States and its European allies learned last fall what Russia
planned to do]{.underline}, and even publicized the Kremlin's plans to
the world. Even so, [they failed to prevent Russia's onslaught on its
much weaker neighbor.]{.underline} Once they ruled out direct military
assistance to Ukraine, [deterring a Russia bent]{.underline} on
controlling its neighbors and upending the post-1990 European security
order [was always going to be a tall order. The same threats that
failed]{.underline} to dissuade Russia from invading before---severe
sanctions, military assistance to Ukraine, and beefing up NATO---[are
unlikely to compel Russia from changing course now. Instead,
**Washington** and its democratic allies **need to embark on** a
strategy of **containment** that increases the cost to Russia and
eventually forces internal political change that brings the brutal
regime of Vladimir Putin to an end.]{.underline} The outlines of this
playbook are familiar, first set out in the late 1940s by George F.
Kennan, a senior diplomat in the Moscow embassy, and elaborated on in
the pages of this magazine. Kennan argued that the [Stalin regime's
paranoia and insecurities represented a clear danger to the West and
called for steady, forceful counterpressure.]{.underline} But Kennan
also believed the Soviet Union was weak and suffered from internal
contradictions that would ultimately undo the regime. Containment took
40 years to succeed and involved plenty of needless mistakes by the
United States---including launching the Vietnam War and backing the
violent overthrow of a number of governments. But the policy ultimately
unleashed forces inside the Soviet Union that led to the end of the
regime. [A return to a robust policy of **containment is** now **the
West's best option**. The fundamental goal will remain the same as the
old policy: to counter Russian expansionism, inflict real costs on the
Russian regime, and encourage internal change that leads to the ultimate
collapse of Putin and Putinism.]{.underline} Of course, [it needs to be
adapted]{.underline} to the realities as they exist today rather than
those that prevailed at the end of World War II. In particular,
[Russia's close ties to a strong and newly assertive China will have to
be addressed proactively.]{.underline} Still, [Russia]{.underline} isn't
the Soviet Union, a military and ideological colossus nearly equal to
the United States. Although it [remains a nuclear power]{.underline},
its military is a shadow of its former Soviet self, and its economy is
smaller than Canada's, which has a quarter of Russia's population.
Meanwhile, [the West has grown stronger. The United States retains
unrivaled military power and has an economy 13 times larger than that of
Russia.]{.underline} Europe, a defeated continent scarred by war and
poverty after World War II, has emerged as a cohesive economic giant
with a military that, although underfunded, enjoys significant modern
capabilities to defend against a stretched Russian military. As a
result, although a policy of **[containment]{.underline}** will not
deliver swift success or victory, its steady application in the months
and years ahead [should **drive** the **necessary change** in Russia
within the next five to ten years.]{.underline} Three Pillars [An
effective twenty-first century update of containment would consist of
three main pillars: maintaining U.S. military strength, decoupling
Western economies from Russia, and isolating Moscow.]{.underline}
Together, these three elements will steadily increase the cost to Russia
of continuing its expansionist policies, foment internal dissent and
debate, and ultimately could force a change in governance. To be clear,
[such change must be driven internally]{.underline}---although the
United States seeks an end to Putinism, this will occur only when the
Russian people decide the time has come. Also, [a return to containment
will not lead to an immediate end to the war in Ukraine. That will
require additional measures]{.underline}, including providing Ukraine
with the military means it needs to defend itself and resist occupation
if Russia succeeds in taking over part or all of the country. And [it
will require massive economic and humanitarian assistance to help the
besieged population in Ukraine and those who have been forced to flee
the country.]{.underline} Although the United States and other NATO
countries maintain significant militaries, two decades of European
under-investment and U.S. military engagement in the Middle East and
Afghanistan have left NATO profoundly unprepared for a return to a
strong deterrent posture. The subordination of the Belarussian military
to Russian command and the invasion of Ukraine mean that a new front
line is being drawn from the Baltic to the Black Sea---with the eastern
borders of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and
Romania effectively marking NATO's new eastern flank. As a result, NATO
needs to move swiftly to defend the new front. [The alliance has taken
steps to bolster deterrence in the East, but these moves fall short of
what the situation demands.]{.underline} The United States has doubled
its ground presence in Poland, to 9,000 troops, and sent air and naval
reinforcements to other countries. France, Germany, and the United
Kingdom have increased their military presence in Romania, Slovakia, and
the Baltic states. NATO has activated its 40,000-strong Response Force
for the first time, though current plans do not include full
mobilization of the entire force. [While these initial steps have
strengthened the forces that were deployed East in the wake of Russia's
initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014, they amount to little more than a
tripwire]{.underline} that will be unable to offer a robust defense if
Russia attacks NATO territory. [NATO's moves have fallen short of what
the situation demands. That is why a fundamental rethinking of NATO's
forward force posture is now necessary. NATO needs to deploy tens of
thousands of troops, rather than the few thousand that have so far been
committed.]{.underline} The most immediate requirement is to deploy two
to three combat brigades to eastern Poland and southern Lithuania to
defend the Suwalki gap, the 60 miles that separate Russian Kaliningrad
and Belarus. If Russian or Belarussian forces were to connect these
territories, the Baltic states would effectively be cut off from the
rest of NATO. [Preparing for a long-term presence in the East will also
require making significant investments in ports, rail lines, airfields,
roads, fuel supply, and other critical infrastructure to improve NATO's
capacity to rapidly reinforce its troops.]{.underline} Moreover, given
Putin's threats to use nuclear weapons, combined with the deployment of
nuclear-capable and likely armed missiles in Kaliningrad and other parts
of western Russia and possibly in Belarus, [**NATO** will need to
**consider** the **adequacy** **of its nuclear posture.**]{.underline}
None of this is to suggest that NATO needs to prepare for war. The point
is that [deterrence now requires greater visibility and forward
presence]{.underline} than was the case before Russia attacked Ukraine.
Whatever Putin may be thinking about forcefully revising the post-1990
security order in Europe, NATO needs to make clear that he cannot
succeed. [That requires]{.underline} a strong deterrent presence East
and [a major commitment to increase spending]{.underline} for the long
run. Germany's decision to spend 100 billion euros now and at least two
percent of GDP on defense going forward is a big step in the right
direction. Beyond Military Might Although military strength is a core
requirement of deterrence, it is not enough. Indeed, [the forward
deployment of military forces will initially reinforce the divisions in
Europe]{.underline}---and would leave the peoples of Ukraine, the
Caucuses, and indeed of Belarus and Russia, under Putin's dominion. The
West cannot allow a return of an Iron Curtain dividing Europe. That is
why [the new containment also needs a policy of economic decoupling and
political isolation---measures that are designed to inflict ever
increasing costs on Russia and force change from within.]{.underline}
The [sanctions]{.underline} announced by the United States and its
allies [are an important first step.]{.underline} [Russia has been
effectively cut off from credit and financial support, and technology
export controls will severely curtail imports into Russia.]{.underline}
Meanwhile, sanctions on Putin, his cronies, and their families will
leave them isolated in their dachas in Russia, unable to gallivant on
their yachts in St Tropez or their London duplexes. Though many have
criticized these sanctions as too little, too late, these critiques
assume that their purpose is to stop Russia's military advance. That was
never going to happen. Instead, [sanctions are designed to inflict costs
over months and years to force a change of behavior.]{.underline} The
effectiveness of sanctions on Russia will depend on two factors. First,
their sting requires that they be applied by as many countries as
possible. The Biden administration has been right to walk in lockstep
with Europe, even as it has engaged diplomatically for months to push
for the maximum possible sanctions. It may make people in Washington
feel good for the United States to announce a rash of sanctions, but
unless others agree to follow, their impact will be limited. As the case
of Iran has shown, coordinated sanctions from 2010 onwards produced a
real nuclear agreement; the unilateral maximum pressure from the United
States since 2018 has only led Iran to accelerate its nuclear program.
Europe gets 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia. Second, [energy
is key.]{.underline} Former Senator John McCain once memorably described
Russia as "a gas station masquerading as a country." But it is a big gas
station, especially for [Europe, which still gets 40 percent of its
natural gas from Russia.]{.underline} Some countries, including the
Czech Republic, Hungary, and Latvia are almost completely dependent for
their gas heat and electricity on imports from Russia. Although
restricting Russian oil and gas imports would hit the Russian economy,
which is highly dependent on fossil fuel exports, the damage such
restrictions would do to European economies would be grave as well. True
decoupling will thus take years, not weeks or months, as Europe finds
alternative sources of gas and reduces its reliance on fossil fuels as
part of its climate change commitments. Aside from military strength and
economic decoupling, [Russia will also need to be isolated
politically.]{.underline} Its unprovoked attack represented a blatant
violation of the UN Charter and international law and runs counter to
Russia's commitment not to change borders by force---a commitment Moscow
repeated numerous times in European security declarations, including the
Helsinki Final Act in 1975, the Charter of Paris in 1990, and the Astana
OSCE Declaration in 2010. And [Russia clearly violated its explicit
guarantee in 1994 to respect Ukraine's borders and territorial integrity
in return for Kyiv's commitment to give up its nuclear weapons. There
can be no return to business as usual with an outlaw
regime.]{.underline} To be sure, [diplomatic channels need to remain
open, as they were during the Cold War.]{.underline} But [Russia's
normal engagement with the rest of the international community must come
to an end.]{.underline} The International Olympic Committee's
recommendation that sporting competitions ban athletes from Russia and
Belarus was the right call, as was the decision by FIFA and UEFA to ban
Russian soccer teams from the World Cup and European championships. The
isolation must extend well beyond sports, however. There is no place for
Russia in the G20 and the diplomatic dance of European leaders heading
off to Moscow that preceded Russia's attack on Ukraine needs to cease.
Aside from Russia's complete and unconditional withdrawal from all of
Ukraine---including the territory it has occupied and annexed since
2014---there is nothing to talk about. [That includes suspending the
strategic stability talks that were aimed at creating a predictable and
stable relationship with Russia. No such relationship is possible so
long as Putin is in power. \"We will make sure that Putin will be a
pariah on the international stage,\" President Biden
declared.]{.underline} At the same time, just as during the Cold War,
[there needs to be a concerted effort to engage Russian civil
society.]{.underline} Inside Russia, opposition to the war is already
surprisingly widespread, as evidenced by the demonstrations that erupted
in recent days in more than 50 cities. As Russian soldiers return in
body bags and sanctions begin to bite, that opposition is bound to grow.
Russians will need access to accurate information, which Western
governments can provide through social media, the internet, and
broadcasting. People-to-people exchanges should continue. [The United
States has opened doors to refuseniks before. It can do so
again.]{.underline} Updating the Playbook To succeed, [the new
containment policy must be embraced by all Western
allies]{.underline}---in Europe, in North America, and even in Asia.
Russia, like the Soviet Union before it, is keen to exploit divisions
within and between democracies. It has interfered in elections for years
and supported far right politics in Europe and beyond. It has used
bribes and Western energy dependence to divide Europe. [Putin saw the
divisions within NATO sown by U.S. President Donald Trump during his
four years in office, and the disagreements over Afghanistan and
submarine sales to Australia that occurred since, as evidence that the
West was weak and divided. Now, he likely thought, was the time to
strike. Putin was wrong. The West has been remarkably unified in its
response.]{.underline} Even before Russia's attack, Western unity within
NATO and beyond had solidified. The Biden administration, perhaps
learning from its Afghanistan stumbles, did a superb job of bringing its
allies together by sharing information, consulting frequently, and
demonstrating tough, determined leadership. The result has been
significant: strong sanctions, bolstered deterrence, and total political
solidarity with Ukraine. To preserve this unity, [the United States,
which has once again emerged as a leader of the West, will need to
carefully listen to allies and be willing to change course to keep
everyone on board.]{.underline} There will be times when internal
divisions will raise questions about the solidity of the coalition.
During the Cold War, NATO seemed to be in perpetual crisis---except when
it mattered most. [There is no place for Russia in the G20.]{.underline}
An important difference between the Cold War era and today is the status
of China. No longer a bit player on the global scene, Beijing has
emerged as the Washington's biggest competitor and largest geopolitical
challenger in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. [The Ukraine crisis emerged
at a moment when the relationship between Russia and China has become
particularly close.]{.underline} Their leaders have met 38 times since
Xi Jinping became president of China in 2012, including most recently at
the opening of the Winter Olympics. There, [they issued a joint
statement noting that their partnership had "no limits."]{.underline}
Far from condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, [Beijing has blamed
the United States and NATO for taking insufficient account of Russia's
security interests.]{.underline} Beijing's pronouncements, however,
contained an undercurrent of unease with Putin's moves. The joint
statement was notably silent on Ukraine, and official statements have
consistently stressed China's principled commitment to sovereignty,
territorial integrity, and noninterference in the internal affairs of
other nations. China abstained on a UN Security Council Resolution
condemning Russia, rather than joining Moscow in voting against. And
Beijing has never recognized Russia's annexation of Crimea, suggesting
it may keep an open mind on the future of Ukraine. There is scope,
therefore, for quiet diplomacy to gauge whether Beijing might be
persuaded to help put pressure on Russia. [Even if Beijing has its
doubts, however, it is hardly in its interest to help the United States
against Russia. Indeed, Chinese leaders no doubt welcome the U.S.'s
renewed preoccupation with security in Europe because it gives Beijing
more freedom of maneuver in its own region.]{.underline} China is also
likely to help alleviate some of the economic consequences of sanctions
for Russia, though there are limits to how much it can do, especially on
the financial side, where transactions largely remain the domain of
western currencies from which Russia has now been banned. [Containing
Russia will therefore require paying attention to China.]{.underline}
One way to increase the West's leverage over Beijing would be to
strengthen the political, economic, and military ties between the
advanced democracies in Asia, Europe, and North America. An expanded
G-7, for example, could include Australia and South Korea as well as the
involvement of the heads of the EU and NATO. These nations and
organizations will need to devise common strategies and policies not
only to contain Russia but also to compete effectively with China.
February 24 was a turning point in history. Democratic powers of the
West are once again called upon to defend a rules-based order that has
been violently uprooted. Fortunately, [the Western powers possess the
innate strength necessary to contain Russia and outcompete China for
influence across the globe. The only real question is whether they have
the will and determination to do so in unison.]{.underline}

**[Nuclear weapons]{.underline}** are not just a force used to deter
another state from attacking -- they **[can also be a shield behind
which one can engage in aggression]{.underline}**, says Stanford scholar
Scott Sagan. [Russian President Vladimir Putin's reminder of **Russia's
nuclear arsenal** at the beginning of its recent invasion into Ukraine
**is a warning** to the United States and other NATO members that if
they get directly involved in the conflict, **there could be a risk of
nuclear escalation**]{.underline}, said Sagan, the co-director of the
Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC). Here, Sagan
discusses Putin's nuclear threat -- it is estimated that [Russia's
stockpile includes 4,477 nuclear warheads]{.underline}, according to a
report published by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists -- and what
could happen if Russia crosses the nuclear threshold, a line that hasn't
been crossed since 1945, when the U.S. detonated two atomic bombs in
Japan. Sagan's research examines nuclear strategy, nuclear
proliferation, the ethics of war, and public opinion of combat. Back in
February, [Putin]{.underline} publicly ordered his Minister of Defense
to [put Russian nuclear forces into "special combat
readiness."]{.underline} [He also warned in a televised statement that
if another nation interferes in the operation, "Russia will respond
immediately, and the consequences will be such as you have never seen in
your entire history." Was **Putin** **threatening** a **nuclear war**?
Putin]{.underline} was [engaging in nuclear saber-rattling, reminding
NATO leaders that he has a large nuclear arsenal and that Russian
military doctrine holds open the option of using nuclear weapons first
if it is losing a war and its vital interests are
threatened.]{.underline} However, the order to go into "special combat
readiness" was not part of the Russian military lexicon and U.S.
officials saw no actual nuclear alert activities underway. But it's
important to understand that [nuclear weapons]{.underline} are not just
a force used to deter another state from attacking. They [can also be a
shield behind which one can undertake aggression.]{.underline} The
Pakistanis moved soldiers into Indian-held Kashmir soon after Islamabad
first tested nuclear weapons. Saddam Hussein wanted nuclear weapons and
told his senior generals that if he got them, he would order a
conventional attack to take back the West Bank and Golan Heights from
Israel. Similarly, [Putin was brandishing his nuclear arsenal to remind
the U.S. and other NATO powers that if they get directly involved in his
war of aggression in Ukraine, there could be a risk of nuclear
escalation.]{.underline} Is Putin's nuclear threat working? Only in
part. President Joe Biden did rule out direct engagement when he said
the U.S. and NATO would not enforce a "no-fly zone" over the Ukraine.
That policy would have meant that NATO aircraft would be shooting down
Russian aircraft, which of course is an act of war, creating the risk of
escalation. But Putin's threats did not deter Washington and many NATO
governments from "interfering" in Moscow's attempt to overthrow the
Zelenskyy government in many other ways, short of direct combat with the
Russians. [We have given the Ukrainian government millions of dollars'
worth of weapons, including air defense systems and advanced anti-tank
missiles, and have provided intelligence support. **Without such rapid
resupply of military equipment, the Ukrainians might** well **have lost
the war already.**]{.underline} Now they have turned back the Russian
assault on Kyiv and Putin appears to have shifted his war aims from
overthrowing the elected Ukrainian government to "liberating" the Donbas
in Eastern Ukraine and possibly annexing it into Russia as he did with
Crimea in 2014. CIA director William Burns recently said, "None of us
can take lightly the threat posed by a potential \[Russian\] resort to
tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons." Are you worried
about the Russians using nuclear weapons against the Ukrainians if the
war continues to go badly for Moscow? Yes. I recently argued in Foreign
Affairs that [Putin is the most dangerous man in the world.]{.underline}
[Putin could order the Russian military to drop a single nuclear bomb on
a Ukrainian city to try to coerce the Zelenskyy government into
immediately surrendering. This frightening scenario is not fanciful. It
is, after all, effectively what the United States did to Japan in
1945.]{.underline} We can only hope that in this situation, senior
Russian officers would tell Putin that such a strike would be illegal, a
violation of the Geneva Conventions, and refuse to comply. Some national
security officials are Putin's cronies, like Defense Minister Sergei
Shoigu, but the military leadership is more independent. [**The U**nited
**S**tates **must** do what it can to **reinforce** any **reluctance
by** the **Russia**n military **to cross the nuclear threshold.**
Washington should be prepared to take further military steps if Moscow
crosses the nuclear threshold.]{.underline} Senior officials should not
specify exactly what kind of military response would be ordered, but [a
clear statement that crossing the nuclear threshold would bring the
gravest consequences for Russia and for Putin might help deter such
action.]{.underline} And [the U.S. should remind Russian military
leaders that any nuclear use against a Ukrainian city will be treated as
a war crime and that they, not just Putin, will be treated as war
criminals. The Russian military may not mind targeting
civilians]{.underline}, as it has shown in its operations in Chechnya,
in Syria, and now in Ukraine. But they do care about protecting
themselves. Do they really want to live in a world in which they have
broken the tradition of nuclear non-use that has existed since 1945?
They may think twice about agreeing to drop nuclear bombs if they know
that they may one day find themselves permanently imprisoned for their
actions. And if Putin gives such a reckless, dangerous order, it may
just be the last straw that makes other leaders in Moscow decide that he
finally has to go.

accuse the Kremlin of planning false flag operations to give itself a
pretext for an armed intervention.\[2\] President Biden himself has said
that he expects Putin to move in, although he (and everybody else)
remains uncertain as to what form Russia's actions will take.\[3\] [The
Biden administration's communication strategy is aimed at persuading
European allies to close ranks while also preventing the Russian
government from taking advantage of an information grey zone to spread
fake news and foment confusion and divisions.]{.underline}\[4\] In spite
of Russia's insistence that it has no hostile intentions, [there is
little doubt that the risk of a renewed Russian intervention in Ukraine
is higher than it has ever been since the annexation of Crimea in
2014.]{.underline} Diplomatic response [The Biden administration has
rejected Russia's demands for -- amongst other things -- a written
guarantee that NATO will not expand to include other former Soviet
republics and]{.underline} massively reduce (actually,
[remove]{.underline}) [its military deployments in]{.underline} central
and Eastern [Europe]{.underline} (else, Moscow has threatened unspecific
"technical-military" actions).\[5\] At the same time, [Biden has agreed
to open negotiations on European security]{.underline}, which has
unfolded in three separate but related tracks: a bilateral US--Russia
channel, a reactivated NATO--Russia Council, and the pan-European
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, so as to give all
parties involved, starting with Ukraine, formal representation.\[6\]
[After consulting with allies, the Biden administration has presented
Russia with a set of possible arrangements over arms control, missile
deployments, military exercises, transparency and confidence-building
measures as well as military-to-military contacts.]{.underline}\[7\]
While these are secondary issues for Putin, they are still of interest
to Russia. Most importantly, [they substantiate a **US and NATO
commitment** to **engage in a broad negotiation over European security**
and start reversing the trend in the abysmal state of West-Russia
relations.]{.underline} Diplomatic exchanges have thus far delivered no
result. The US offer has disappointed the Russians, who insist that
NATO's enlargement fundamentally undermines their national security.
They have nonetheless accepted to keep talking, and the two sides have
engaged in a back-and-forth exchange of written proposals for
compromise.\[8\] In the meantime, Russia's military mobilisation has
continued unabated.\[9\] President Biden, who has used two virtual
summits to warn Putin about the terrible consequences of an
intervention, has started preparing a multifaceted response.\[10\]
Defence and deterrence Biden has ruled out the use of US troops in
defence of Ukraine, to which he has nonetheless pledged full political
support and continued military assistance (the US has provided Ukraine
with 2.5 billion US dollars' worth of military assets since 2014, 650
million in 2021 alone).\[11\] Meanwhile, [the US has moved 3,000 troops
from Germany to Poland and Romania and put further 8,500 soldiers on
heightened alert for a possible deployment to central and eastern
Europe.]{.underline}\[12\] [Other NATO member states have followed
suit.]{.underline} The United Kingdom has said it will commit more
troops to the Baltic area, naval forces to the Black Sea, air patrolling
of Bulgaria and Romania's airspace, as well as rocket systems to
Estonia.\[13\] France has offered to send troops to Romania, Denmark has
deployed additional military aircraft to Lithuania and Spain has sent a
frigate to the Black Sea.\[14\] A number of weapons systems would follow
NATO and US soldiers, including air defences, artillery, armoured
vehicles, warships and aircraft, thereby bolstering the few thousand
troops NATO keeps in central and eastern Europe. Most likely, these
deployments would lose their rotational nature and become fully
permanent. Economic retaliation The policy area that has witnessed
greater activism on the part of the United States has revolved around
potential economic retaliation.\[15\] [The Biden administration has
worked on a wide-ranging set of measures that would cut off foreign
lending, ban sales of sovereign bonds and blacklist Russia's major
financial institutions. It is reportedly also considering to ban the
export to Russia of products containing US-made or US-designed
semiconductors]{.underline}, which are [the essential component of
computers, smartphones and other electronic devices.]{.underline}\[16\]
The US administration has agreed with the UK government to target the
assets (both financial and otherwise) of some of the most prominent
Russian oligarchs as well as people belonging to Putin's inner
circle.\[17\] Further, it has coordinated with the European Union on a
set of restrictions that would strengthen the financial sanctions and
ban the export of technologies for critical industry, most notably for
the development of new gas projects.\[18\] Even though it has so far
ruled out an embargo on energy imports from Russia, [the Biden
administration has extracted from Germany a pledge to put the activation
of Nord Stream 2, the controversial Russian-German gas pipeline under
the Baltic, indefinitely on hold.]{.underline}\[19\] Sustainability and
effectiveness problems [The Biden administration aims to raise the costs
for Russia of any intervention against Ukraine, while also trying to
promote a diplomatic way out of the crisis.]{.underline} It remains
unclear whether Putin might be content with the high-level security
dialogue the US is offering. It is also uncertain whether anything the
US and its allies have put on the table may be enough to dissuade Putin
from "moving in", not least because the Russian president can pick
amongst multiple options.\[20\] These span a large-scale invasion, a
further militarisation and de facto integration of Donetsk and Luhansk,
Ukraine's eastern regions in which Russia has supported separatist
movements since 2014, and a number of hybrid actions, including the
intensification of the ongoing cyberattacks against Ukraine.\[21\] [A
large-scale attack would make it easier for Biden to keep the cohesion
of the Atlantic front, but would create problems of
sustainability.]{.underline}\[22\] Energy prices would likely spiral,
thus prolonging the inflationary wave that has been mounting since last
year (especially in the United States). [Sanctions would wreak havoc on
Russia's economy]{.underline}, but would most likely inflict a heavy
cost on Europe too, especially Germany and Italy (the EU's first and
third largest economies respectively), at a time of sustained but
uncertain post-Covid recovery. [A more limited intervention by Russia
would engender an equal and opposite problem]{.underline}, whereby
effectiveness could be sacrificed on the altar of sustainability.
Western countries hold different views of what the minimum threshold is
for them to be willing to absorb the economic pain that comes with the
imposition of sanctions on Russia.\[23\] The measures they could agree
upon would therefore be sustainable over time, but would hardly be as
tough as the most strident critics of Putin deem necessary.
**[Biden]{.underline}**'s response has yet to pass the test of Russia's
intervening in Ukraine, if that indeed comes about. However, his
**[administration has laid solid foundations for
continued]{.underline}** and intense **[transatlantic security
dialogue.]{.underline}** This is all the more important given that the
European Union has provided no alternative to France and Germany's
attempt to have a separate dialogue with Moscow.\[24\] Yet the French
have admitted that this diplomatic channel is complementary, rather than
conflicting, with the transatlantic one.\[25\] \*\*\* In conclusion,
**[the Biden administration has skillfully used or threatened to use
intelligence, diplomatic, defence, deterrence and economic assets to
face Russia's challenge to Europe's security.]{.underline}** Most
notably, it has consulted extensively with allies, showing regard for
their specific sensitivities while organising a coordinated
response.\[26\] With the spectre of interstate war looming on the
continent, [history has indeed come back to Europe. With the Biden
administration, so has US leadership.]{.underline}

(CNN) --- [The **US** is expected **to keep 100,000 troops stationed in
Europe** for the foreseeable future **unless Russia escalates and
threatens** Sweden and Finland or **NATO** members]{.underline},
according to multiple US officials. [The numbers could]{.underline}
temporarily [increase]{.underline} if NATO carries out more military
exercises in the region, and the US could add additional bases in Europe
if the security environment changes, the officials added. The plans are
being considered following Thursday\'s meeting of NATO\'s military
chiefs in Brussels, the officials said. The military chiefs are making
the recommendations to a NATO defense ministers meeting planned for
June, and NATO leaders including President Joe Biden will meet in Madrid
at the end of that month. The US increased its overall force posture in
Europe from about 60,000 troops before Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine to
about 100,000 now, adding troops and military assets to countries along
Europe\'s eastern flank to support NATO and to further deter Russia.
[The US contributed thousands of troops to NATO\'s Response Force, which
was activated for the first time in NATO\'s history earlier this
spring.]{.underline} These recommendations are consistent with what top
military leaders have been telling US lawmakers. In April, Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told members of Congress he
endorsed creating permanent US bases in Eastern Europe as a response to
Russia\'s attack on Ukraine. But Milley said he believed US troops at
those bases could be rotational. He said he didn\'t think the US needed
to permanently station troops at them to create an effective deterrent.
US intel skeptical Putin will be swayed by Russian public opinion over
war in Ukraine NATO\'s military chiefs, including Gen. Tod Wolters who
serves as both Commander of US European Command and Supreme Allied
Commander, Europe, participated in the meetings in Brussels as the war
in Ukraine grinds on, nearing the three-month mark since Russia\'s
invasion began. The [US]{.underline} added thousands of troops in Europe
on temporary rotations, [deployed additional military assets to the
Eastern flank to support eight new NATO battlegroups, and sent billions
of dollars in military assistance to Ukraine, alongside NATO
allies.]{.underline} However, the Pentagon recently announced
replacement troops for those temporary rotations, signaling the
increased [US presence will be maintained for some time to
come.]{.underline} The Pentagon announced that approximately 10,500 US
Army personnel would be deployed to Europe in the coming weeks and
months to replace forces that are already there on May 13. As well as
the larger NATO meetings Gen. Milley also met military leaders from
France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom as well as Finland and
Sweden this week, according to readouts from Joint Staff Spokesperson
Col. Dave Butler. As Sweden and Finland are poised to join NATO, US
officials don\'t believe additional forces will be needed unless Russia
suddenly poses a threat to the two Nordic countries. [If Russia were to
move weaponry or make serious threats to move weaponry closer, the force
posture might have to be further reassessed]{.underline}, the officials
said. [Sweden and Finland have expressed concerns about their security
in the interim period after they submitted their applications for
membership, asking certain NATO allies for additional security support
while the process plays out.]{.underline} Certain nations have agreed to
provide additional support to the two countries, Admiral Robert Bauer,
Chair of the NATO Military Committee, said Thursday. Most NATO members
have welcomed Finland and Sweden\'s application to join but Turkey has
raised objections. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with Swedish
Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist at the Pentagon Wednesday, a day before
the NATO military chiefs meeting in Brussels. \"The secretary made it
very clear that we have a comfort level with their military going back
many years, and that at a staff level we\'ll be happy to have a
discussion with them about security and capability needs that they might
have to help assure them and to deter Russia should that be necessary,\"
a senior defense official said of the meeting between Austin and
Hultqvist Wednesday. The official said there would be continued staff
level discussions about what the needs of Sweden\'s might be and how the
US could help fulfill them, and that the US has also engaged Finland in
similar staff level discussions. The request for additional security
needs might not result in additional US troops, the official added. As
an example, the US might engage in additional military exercises with
Sweden or Finland, according to the official. A more permanent force
posture change [NATO and US leaders have been hinting at a more
permanent change in European force posture in response to Russia\'s
ongoing invasion with a possible announcement at the NATO summit in
Madrid next month. It could solidify the 100,000 troop level for some
time]{.underline} to come. In April, Austin told US lawmakers that
[**the war in Ukraine and Putin\'s actions will change the US military
footprint in Europe.**]{.underline} \"This unlawful and unprovoked
aggression by Putin has the effect of changing the security architecture
in the region for some time to come,\" Austin said. [\"We do expect that
it will change our footprint. In terms of how much it changes the US
contribution, that\'s left to be seen.\"]{.underline} Secretary of State
Antony Blinken and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg both hinted
at an announcement about [a more permanent change in NATO\'s military
posture, specifically in Eastern Europe]{.underline} at the conclusion
of the NATO informal foreign ministers ministerial in Berlin, Germany on
May 15. \"We also spent time here in Berlin laying the groundwork for
next month\'s summit in Madrid,\" Blinken said during a press conference
at the conclusion of the NATO informal meeting in Berlin. \"NATO is
going to release its new Strategic Concept laying out how the Alliance
will sustain and strengthen transatlantic security in the face of
President Putin\'s aggression as well as other emerging threats. And
we\'ll look ahead to our continuing efforts to fortify our force posture
on NATO\'s eastern flank.\" Stoltenberg said [the alliance will \"make
important decisions to reinforce NATO\'s deterrence and defense to
reflect the new security reality in Europe,\"]{.underline} during the
summit in Madrid next month after the conclusion of the informal meeting
in Berlin on May 15.

### 2AC\-\--US Involvement Key

#### U.S. involvement is key to deter and prevent nuclear escalation

[America has crossed a threshold in Ukraine, both in its short-term
involvement and its long-term intent.]{.underline} The U.S. was
initially cautious during the fall and winter as Russia, a nuclear
country with veto power at the U.N. Security Council, amassed more than
a hundred and fifty thousand troops along the Ukrainian border. It
didn't want to poke the Russian bear---or provoke Vladimir Putin
personally. Two days after long convoys of Russian tanks rolled across
the border, on February 24th, the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony
Blinken, still [claimed that America's goal---backed by hundreds of
millions of dollars in military aid---was simply to stand behind the
Ukrainian people. The White House sanctioned
Russia]{.underline}---initially targeting a few banks, oligarchs,
political élites, government-owned enterprises, and Putin's own
family---[to pressure the Russian leader to put his troops back in their
box, without resorting to military intervention. "**Direct
confrontation** between NATO and Russia **is** World War Three,
**something we must strive to prevent**,"]{.underline} President Joe
Biden said, in early March. Yet in just over nine weeks, [the conflict
has rapidly evolved into a full proxy war with Russia, with global
ramifications.]{.underline} U.S. officials now frame America's role in
more ambitious terms that border on aggressive. The goal---backed by
tens of billions of dollars in aid---is to "weaken" Russia and insure a
sovereign Ukraine outlasts Putin. "Throughout our history, we've learned
that when dictators do not pay the price for their aggression, they
cause more chaos and engage in more aggression," the President told
reporters on Thursday. "They keep moving. And the costs, the threats to
America and the world, keep rising." Having basically run out of
appropriated funds, [Biden has asked Congress for thirty-three billion
dollars---for new military, economic, and humanitarian support---in the
latest of several packages for Ukraine.]{.underline} ["The cost of this
fight is not cheap,"]{.underline} the President acknowledged. (As
Politico noted, the new aid is about half the size of the entire Russian
defense budget---and also more than half of the U.S. State Department's
annual budget. Over the next five months, U.S. aid to Ukraine will
average more than two hundred million dollars a day.) [The investment,
Biden said, was **a small price "to lessen the risk of future conflicts"
with Russia.**]{.underline} For Putin, the war in [Ukraine]{.underline}
always seemed to be, at least in part, [a proxy fight with NATO and its
U.S. leadership.]{.underline} Ahead of his invasion, he publicly
expressed deep paranoia about the military alliance and its further
expansion into countries once aligned with the Soviet Union. He also
brokered a five-thousand-word agreement with the Chinese President, Xi
Jinping, to form a de-facto alliance of authoritarian regimes. They
jointly opposed NATO enlargement. Biden tried to resist that framing. At
the start of the invasion, the U.S. invoked the principles of
sovereignty, a democratically elected government, and territorial
integrity. During the past week, however, [**Ukraine**'s existential
crisis **has** increasingly **appeared to be America's war**,
too.]{.underline} On April 24th, Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd
Austin took a train with blacked-out windows into Kyiv to meet President
Volodymyr [Zelensky]{.underline} and symbolically [reinforce American
support.]{.underline} The stealthy trip reflected the increasingly
ambitious U.S. goal. ["We want to see Russia weakened to the degree it
can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading
Ukraine,"]{.underline} Austin told reporters, near the border in Poland.
Blinken said, "We don't know how the rest of this war will unfold, but
we do know that a sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot
longer than Vladimir Putin is on the scene." On Tuesday, [Austin
assembled defense leaders from more than forty countries---well beyond
the NATO framework---at Ramstein, a U.S. base in southwest Germany, to
coördinate support for Ukraine.]{.underline} Austin, a retired general
involved in both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, announced the formation
of a new coalition of "nations of good will" that will meet monthly to
"intensify" an international campaign to win "today's fight and the
struggles to come." In appealing for more aid, [Biden said, **"We have
to do our part** as well, **leading the alliance."** The
shift]{.underline} may have been [inevitable]{.underline}, given the
barbarism of the war, which has claimed thousands of civilian lives, and
Russia's challenge to the conventions and obligations of modern
statecraft. "If this is left to stand, if there is no answer to this
aggression, if Russia gets away with this cost-free, then so goes the
so-called international order," General Mark Milley, the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on CNN. "And if that happens, then we're
heading into an era of seriously increased instability." On Friday, the
Pentagon press secretary John Kirby choked up at a briefing as he
discussed Putin's "depravity." [The U.S. has become more deeply engaged
for at least four reasons. Diplomacy between Ukraine and Russia has
stalled amid revelations of atrocities committed by Russian troops,
notably the execution of civilians in Bucha. Moscow's early
participation in peace talks never seemed credible anyway; Putin is too
greedy and historically ambitious. Russia has staked claims to southern
Crimea, the eastern Donbas region, and the lands between them along the
strategic Black Sea. Putin is not yet ready---or, perhaps, not yet under
enough pressure---to negotiate seriously. The U.S. has also been
emboldened by the stunning underperformance of the Russian
military]{.underline}, the largest in Europe. U.S. intelligence had
originally feared that Kyiv could fall within seventy-two hours. But
Ukraine held the capital, and Russian forces retreated. Washington is no
longer hesitant to poke the bear. Yet time still "is not on Ukraine's
side," Milley reportedly told the coalition of defense leaders at
Ramstein. His concern was reinforced on Thursday, when Russia struck
cities across Ukraine just an hour after the U.N. Secretary-General,
António Guterres, speaking at a press conference in Kyiv, described the
country as the "epicenter of unbearable heartache and pain." Guterres's
trip to Kyiv followed talks with Putin in Moscow. The U.N. leader, who
toured Bucha, took a clear side in the conflict. ["The war is an
absurdity in the twenty-first century," he said. "The war is evil." The
growing U.S. involvement also reflects broader fears]{.underline}---long
held among countries on or near Russia's borders ---[that Putin's
aggression will not stop with Ukraine.]{.underline} On April 22nd, a
senior Russian military commander announced that Moscow sought "full
control" over eastern and southern Ukraine in part to open the way to
neighboring Moldova, a tiny, landlocked country that is supportive of
the European Union but dependent on Russian energy. In congressional
testimony on Thursday, Blinken cited the urgent need "to seize the
strategic opportunities" and address "the risks that are presented by
Russia's overreach as countries reconsider their policies, their
priorities, their relationships." Moscow's flagrant rhetoric about
nuclear weapons has also increasingly alarmed U.S. officials. ["Nobody
wants to see this war escalate any more than it already
has,"]{.underline} Kirby said, on April 27th. "Certainly **[nobody wants
to see]{.underline}**---or nobody should want to see---**[it escalate
into the nuclear realm."]{.underline}** The Biden Administration has
public support for its expanding role---for now. Despite war weariness
after two decades in Afghanistan and Iraq, roughly two-thirds of
[Americans believe that **the U.S. has a "moral responsibility" to do
more to stop** the killing of civilians in **Ukraine**]{.underline},
according to a Quinnipiac poll published in mid-April. In a country
polarized on most other issues, a majority from both parties agreed.
Three-quarters of those polled also fear that [the worst is yet to
come.]{.underline} And more than eighty per cent believe that Vladimir
Putin is a war criminal. Yet the public's moral outrage "stops at the
water's edge when it comes to committing the U.S. military to the
fight," Tim Malloy, a Quinnipiac University analyst, noted. Only
nineteen per cent of Americans believe the U.S. should do more even if
it risks getting into a direct war with Russia. That conviction may soon
be tested. [The U.S. role has evolved]{.underline}---from a reactive
response to Russia's unjustified war to a proactive assertion of
American leadership and leverage. Perhaps in desperation, [Putin's
rhetoric has become bolder.]{.underline} On Wednesday, [he warned that
he could launch a "lightning-fast" response]{.underline} to any nation
that intervened to thwart or threaten Russia. "We have all the
instruments for this, such that no one can boast of," he said, [**in**
an apparent **reference to Moscow's nuclear** and missile **arsenal.
"We're going to use them if we have to."**]{.underline} [The war could
now play out in many disparate ways. Each carries its own dangers---for
the U.S. as well as Ukraine.]{.underline}

KEY TAKEAWAYS [After many years of U.S. hegemony following the Cold War,
**Russia has gained**---and is exercising---**the capabilities to
threaten the U**nited **S**tates and its interests.]{.underline} In
addition to modernizing and numerically increasing existing nuclear
capabilities, [**Russia is building** entirely **new nuclear
capabilities. Managing competition with Russia will require significant
investment and effort** that the American public and the current
administration may be reluctant to make.]{.underline} After many years
of U.S. hegemony following the Cold War, Russia has gained---and is
exercising---the capabilities to threaten the United States and its
interests abroad. [Russia invests in military capabilities to confront
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other neighboring
states.]{.underline} Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea demonstrated its
use of hybrid warfare to accomplish its aims and project power across
the Black Sea. [Moscow]{.underline} is propping up Syrian dictator
Bashir al-Assad, defending Iran at the United Nations (UN) Security
Council, and amassing military forces in the Arctic. It has [authorized
multiple cyber-attacks against the United States and continues to target
vulnerabilities in the U.S. defense industrial base. It uses political
warfare to sow discord in the United States, from interfering in U.S.
elections to spreading propaganda about the "dangers" of U.S missile
defense.]{.underline} Perhaps most significantly, [**Russia** invests
billions of dollars into adding to its nuclear arsenal and developing
new nuclear capabilities, **disrupting** the **nuclear balance** with
the United States.]{.underline} Consequently, [the current and previous
administrations have framed U.S.-Russia relations as a
competition]{.underline}, which involves two states striving for global
power and opposing interests. Such a competition implies that actors in
opposition to each other are pursuing a victory. But what does it look
like to win in a competition with Russia? Based on the U.S. history of
war and conflict, Americans typically view winning a competition as a
definitive change in status quo, or strategic realignment, that works in
the U.S. favor. A model American victory might look like the outcome of
the Revolutionary War, which resulted in the independent American state,
or Japan's transformation to a democratic ally after it lost World War
II. It once appeared that the United States was making progress toward
this model of strategic realignment for Russia after the Cold War ended
and the Soviet Union fell. Much of U.S.-Russian policy through the
2000's was rooted in the idea that with a little more nudging, Russia
would complete the transition from unfriendly autocracy to democratic
member of the rules-based international order. Such policy is evidenced
by President George W. Bush's push for a new era of improved relations
with Russia, and President Barack Obama's attempted Russian "reset."
While [the Russian threat has worsened in recent years]{.underline}, one
school of thought argues that the United States can still achieve this
strategic realignment once Russia achieves full internal political
change. Activists like Vladimir Kara-Murza argue such change could occur
in the near term. Another camp argues that the United States can end the
competition if it stops antagonizing Russia. This school of thought
accepts the premise that [**U.S. capabilities** like missile defense
provoke Russia to build up its forces and asserts that unilateral
concessions will **convince Russia to draw back its forces** as
well.]{.underline} Others go further to argue that the Russian threat is
overblown and Russia is too weak to pose a serious threat, so there is
no competition to "win;" instead, the United States should redirect
unneeded resources away from U.S.-Russia competition. This paper argues
that [Russia's fundamental nature and interests will continue to
threaten the United States for the foreseeable future]{.underline} and
therefore a path to a traditional concept of victory is unlikely. It
rejects the idea that Russia will achieve full internal change and
become friendly to the United States due to its longstanding nature as
an aggressive, paranoid, power-seeking, and autocratic state, no matter
its leader. Based on this assessment, concessions or attempts at
cooperation with Russia will fail. Indeed, history illustrates that
Russia interprets these as weaknesses and exploits the opportunity to
advance its position. As a result, [the closest the United States can
come to "winning" is successfully managing competition with Russia to
mitigate the threat it poses and keep Russian aggression at
bay.]{.underline} [**To manage competition, the U**nited **S**tates
**must strengthen its capabilities** and posture required **to deter
Russia**n mischief in all arenas of competition as well as avoid making
concessions.]{.underline}

With Russia's invasion of Ukraine, [a renewed assessment of **efforts by

(**NATO**) **to deter Russia from** taking **military action** on NATO's
eastern flank has become particularly salient.]{.underline} In the

recommendations which will help inform the discussion and ultimately
strengthen NATO's conventional deterrence posture. Contemporary academic
research on conventional deterrence highlights clear gaps in the
deterrence capacity of the United States and NATO, despite their
concerted efforts to strengthen conventional military capability since
Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. For example, studies indicate that
the rotational military forces established by the United States'
Operation Atlantic Resolve and NATO's enhanced Forward Presence, still
lack the requisite conventional capability to prevent a Russian fait
accompli in the Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. However,
these studies lack a well-defined formula for what constitutes adequate
capability and say little about what adjustments the United States and
[NATO must]{.underline} make to [strengthen]{.underline} NATO's
[deterrence posture in the Baltics and Poland.]{.underline} To help
clarify capability requirements in the region, we reviewed conventional
deterrence theories and models from the Cold War. Though long-standing,
this research provides a clearer picture of the ideal defensive force
posture and adequate force ratios needed to improve deterrence, compared
to recent policy analyses. Focusing on land-based operations, we then
applied these correlation of forces models to analyze the current
balance of conventional ground forces in the Baltics. Through comparing
the relative combat power of NATO's forces in the Baltics with Russia's
forces in its Western Military District and Kaliningrad oblast, we
confirmed that the NATO capability gaps identified in previous studies
remain large. We also found that potential NATO high readiness
reinforcements would be incapable of closing the gaps for at least a
month in a crisis scenario. These capability shortcomings clearly hinder
the United States' and NATO's ongoing efforts to conventionally deter
Russian aggression in the Baltics or to decisively respond in a crisis.
Accounting for U.S. military budget limitations, force structure
constraints, and competing global requirements, [the Department of
Defense (**DOD**) **could make several policy adjustments to strengthen
U.S.** capabilities **and rapidly reinforce security** in the
Baltics.]{.underline} Specifically, [the U.S. military could increase
U.S. armored forces in Central Europe, enhance the operational readiness
of U.S. ground forces, and support upgrades to NATO mobility systems and
infrastructure in Central and Eastern Europe.]{.underline} These modest
recommendations, outlined in this paper, represent feasible options to
strengthen NATO's deterrence against an increasingly aggressive Russia.
[The ongoing invasion of Ukraine and attempts to coerce NATO members
into making concessions underscore the compelling and urgent need to
address critical U.S. and NATO capability deficits.]{.underline}

### 2AC\-\--Russia Fill-In

#### If the US collapses, Russia fill-in is worse.

at the Brookings Institution, and assistant research professor of
Islamic studies at Fuller Seminary, 3/6/2022, \"There Are Many Things
Worse Than American Power,\" Atlantic,

kav

If there was any doubt before, the answer is now clear. [Vladimir Putin
is showing that a world without American power---or, for that matter,
Western power---is not a better world.]{.underline}

For the generation of Americans who came of age in the shadow of the
September 11 attacks, the world America had made came with a question
mark. Their formative experiences were the ones in which American power
had been used for ill, in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the Middle East more
broadly, and for much longer, the [United States had built a security
architecture around some of the world's most repressive
regimes.]{.underline} For those on the left, this was nothing new, and
it was all too obvious. I spent my college years reading Noam Chomsky
and other leftist critics of U.S. foreign policy, and they weren't
entirely wrong. On balance, the U.S. may have been a force for good, but
in particular regions and at particular times, it had been anything but.

[Blaming America first became all too easy]{.underline}. After September
11, U.S. power was as overwhelming as it was uncontested. That it was
squandered on two endless wars made it convenient to focus on America's
sins, while underplaying Russia's and China's growing ambitions.

For his part, Putin understood well that the balance of power was
shifting. Knowing what he knew, the Russian president wasn't necessarily
"irrational" in deciding to invade Ukraine. He had good reason to think
that he could get away with it. After all, [he had gotten away with
quite a lot for nearly 15 years, ever since the Russian war against
Georgia in 2008]{.underline}, when George W. Bush was still president.
[Then he annexed Crimea in 2014 and intervened brutally in Syria in
2015. Each time, in an understandable desire to avoid an escalatory
spiral with Russia, the United States held back and tried not to do
anything that might provoke Putin]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [Europe
became more and more dependent on Russian energy;]{.underline} Germany,
for example, was importing 55 percent of its natural gas from Russia.
Just three weeks ago, it was possible for Der Spiegel to declare that
most Germans thought "peace with Russia is the only thing that matters."

The narrative of a feckless and divided West solidified for years. We,
as Americans, were feeling unsure of ourselves, so it was only
reasonable that Putin would feel it too. In such a context, and after
four years of Donald Trump and the domestic turmoil that he wrought, it
was tempting to valorize "restraint" and limited engagements abroad.
Worried about imperial overreach, most of the American left opposed
direct U.S. military action against Bashar al-Assad's regime in the
early 2010s, even though it was Russian and Iranian intervention on
behalf of Syria's dictator that bore the marks of a real imperial
enterprise, not just an imagined one.

Russia's unprovoked attack on a sovereign nation, in Europe no less, has
put matters back in their proper framing. The question of whether the
United States is a uniquely malevolent force in global politics has been
resolved. In the span of a few days, [skeptics of American power have
gotten a taste of what a world where America grows weak and Russia grows
strong looks like]{.underline}. Of course, there are still holdouts who
insist on seeing the United States as the provocateur. In its only
public statement on Ukraine, the Democratic Socialists of America
condemned Russia's invasion but also called for "the U.S. to withdraw
from NATO and to end the imperialist expansionism that set the stage for
this conflict." This is an odd statement considering that Russia, rather
than the United States, has been the world's most unabashedly
imperialist force for the past three decades. But many on the
anti-imperialist left aren't really anti-imperialist; they just have an
instinctive aversion to American power.

America's low opinion of its own capacity for good---and the resulting
desire to retreat or disengage---hasn't just been a preoccupation of the
far left. [The crisis of confidence has been pervasive, spreading to the
halls of power and even President Barack Obama,]{.underline} whose
memorable mantra was "Don't do stupid shit." Instead of thinking about
what we could do, or what we could do better, [Obama was more interested
in a self-limiting principle]{.underline}. For their part, European
powers---content to bask under their U.S. security umbrella---could
afford to believe in fantasies of perpetual peace. Europe's gentleness
and lethargy---coaxing Germany to commit even 2 percent of its GDP to
defense seemed impossible---became something of a joke. One popular
Twitter account, \@ISEUConcerned, devoted itself to mocking the European
Union's propensity to express "concern," but do little else, whenever
something bad happened.

Suddenly, the EU has been aroused from its slumber, and the parody
account was rendered temporarily speechless. This is no longer tepid
concern, but righteous fury. Member states announced that they would
send anti-tank weapons to Ukraine. Germany, for the first time, said
that it would ramp up its military budget to 100 billion euros. On the
economic front, the EU announced some of the toughest sanctions in
history. My podcast co-host, Damir Marusic, an Atlantic Council senior
fellow, likened it to a "holy war," European-style.

Sometimes, unusual and extreme events mark the separation between old
and new ways of thinking and being. This week, the Berlin-based
journalist Elizabeth Zerofsky remarked that the current moment reminded
her of the memoir The World of Yesterday, written by the Austrian
novelist Stefan Zweig as World War II loomed. In it, he recalls the
twilight of the Austro-Hungarian Empire with an almost naive fondness.
On the first day of the Ukraine invasion, I happened to be speaking to a
group of college students who had no memory of September 11. I told them
that they may be living in history. Those students, like all of us, are
bearing witness to one of those rare events that recast how individuals
and nations alike view the world they inhabit.

The coming weeks, months, and years are likely to be as fascinating as
they are terrifying. In a sense, we knew that a great confrontation was
coming, even if we hadn't quite envisioned its precise contours. At the
start of his presidency, Joe Biden declared that the battle between
democracies and autocracies would be the defining struggle of our time.
This was grandiose rhetoric, but was it more than that? What does it
actually mean to fight such a battle?

In any number of ways, [Russia's aggression has underscored why Biden
was right and why authoritarians---and the authoritarian idea
itself---are such a threat to peace and stability]{.underline}. Russia
invaded Ukraine, a democracy, because of the recklessness and domination
of one man, Vladimir Putin. The countries that have rallied most
enthusiastically behind Ukraine have almost uniformly been democracies,
chief among them the United States. America is lousy, disappointing, and
maddeningly hypocritical in its conduct abroad, but the notion of [any
moral equivalence between the United States and Putin's Russia has been
rendered laughable]{.underline}. And if there is such a thing as a
better world, then anti-imperialists may find themselves in the odd
position of hoping and praying for the health and longevity of not just
the West but of Western power.

### AT: Retrenchment Good

#### Europe doesn't have a nuclear deterrent to fend off Russia.

International Security, 45 (4), pp. 7--43,
https://doi.org/10.1162/isec_a_00405, kav)

Nuclear deterrence. As a legacy of the Cold War, [Russia maintains a
formidable arsenal of approximately 6,400 nuclear weapons, which vastly
overshadows the combined arsenals of France and the UK]{.underline} (290
and 195 nuclear weapons, respectively).159 In addition to Russia\'s
numerical preponderance, it matters greatly that this force is wielded
by a single actor, not a collective one. In contrast, strategic
divergences and technological constraints are highly likely to hamper
the emergence of a European nuclear deterrent either through the
Europeanization of the French and/or British nuclear deterrents and/or
through a German nuclear deterrent.

As Ulrich Kühn and Tristan Volpe explain, [Germany would have to
surmount major technical, political, and security obstacles before
acquiring a nuclear deterrent.]{.underline}160 Not only would it face
the domestic and international pressures fueled by reviving fears of
German hegemony, but it would have "to either repurpose its nuclear
energy infrastructure for weapons production or sprint to the bomb from
new military facilities,"161 a prospect made even more unlikely given
that Germany plans to shut down its entire nuclear fleet by 2022.162
Accordingly, "[Germany does not have the required wherewithal for even a
rudimentary program]{.underline}."163

In turn, the Europeanization of nuclear sharing (or Euro-deterrent)
based on the nuclear capabilities of France and/or the United Kingdom
independent of the United States would also "face high hurdles and
immense costs that might well prove prohibitive."164 [French nuclear
experts note that there is "near-zero appetite in France for
transferring its nuclear assets to Europe."]{.underline}165 Likewise,
Barbara Kunz observes that analysts across Europe agree that the
Europeanization of the French bomb, however defined, is "unlikely and
hardly feasible."166

The prospects of a Franco-British nuclear deterrent are even less
likely. For one, it [is highly improbable that French or British
policymakers would be willing to sacrifice London or Paris for Tallinn
or Riga. Second, the UK has left the EU, so France and the UK would have
to overcome their previously discussed divergent strategic priorities to
create an integrated Franco-British military structure for nuclear
planning outside the EU. Finally, the heavy dependence of the UK\'s
nuclear deterrent on U.S. technology and on cooperation with the United
States would further complicate such an endeavor.]{.underline}

Ultimately, [the notion forwarded by restraint scholars that European
countries can easily and quickly balance Russia is ungrounded. Balancing
Russia would be extremely difficult, and such a buildup would
necessarily take a very long time.]{.underline} Our interviews with
European policymakers reveal that they clearly understand this problem.
A former UK ministry of defense official stresses that the "[temporal
factor would be quite long. ... These sort of capabilities take a long
time to develop."167 Likewise, as a former German official bluntly
explains, "The whole defense and capability requirements would be so
extreme that the upgrade that would be needed to fill the gap if the
U.S. completely withdrew is totally off limits for the foreseeable
future."]{.underline}168

#### Beckley's correct---America remains the hegemon now but tech may change LIO

**Layne et al 2020** \[Christopher Layne, Emma Ashford, Mauro Gilli,

America Will Remain the World's Sole Superpower\", H-Diplo \| ISSF,

Gilli also points to another unknown about the future: the possibility
of a "technological revolution that changes the global source of wealth
and power." Technological change---what Gilli calls the "Fourth
Industrial Revolution"---that is "unfolding in front of our eyes might
make current sources of wealth and power obsolete. So if this new
industrial-technological revolution does indeed materialize, much will
depend on whether it reinforces America's current economic and military
advantages, or, rather, creates opportunities for a rival with a
different set of capabilities and institutions more suited to benefit
from this revolution." Gilli thus cautions that although [**Beckley's**
forecast of continuing American unipolar power may be
**correct,**]{.underline} there is always the chance that discontinuous
change could lead to a different outcome. In the final analysis, Gilli
concludes, "to predict whether the U.S. will maintain its edge in world
politics, we thus need to understand whether a technological revolution
is indeed taking place, and who will gain and who will lose from it."
Shifrinson joins Ashford and Gilli [in saluting Beckley's contribution
to the debates **on how best to measure power in international politics,
and on** the grand strategic **implications of China's
rise**]{.underline}. Unrivaled, he notes, "joins a series of studies
pushing back on the perception that the United States is soon to fall
into the dustbin of history." Moreover, Shifrinson comments, [if Beckley
is right, his attempt to construct a new framework for measuring power
may force security studies scholars and diplomatic historians to
re-evaluate great power politics because "much of what we think we know
of the link between power and international outcomes could now be
suspect."]{.underline} Indeed, Shifrinson suggests, if [Beckley is
correct]{.underline}, a "reformation" of the discipline of IR/security
studies would be in order. Shifrinson also identifies some flaws in
Beckley's argument, one of which is that Beckley does not provide much
guidance for identifying which states qualify for great power status,
and which do not.

Rather than aiming at unrealistic targets like containment, decoupling,
or regime change that are incapable of solidifying domestic U.S. support
or attracting international buy-in, the [United States needs to craft a
strategy that can be the basis for broad and lasting
support]{.underline}. Recent polling suggests that elements of such an
[approach would include strengthening American economic competitiveness,
protecting the credibility of American security commitments to allies
and partners, and defending U.S. values.]{.underline} Setting priorities
along these lines would have a disciplining effect on the policy
process. A coherent policy process would identify realistic objectives
and form plans to achieve them. [This process could involve both
defensive and offensive efforts]{.underline}, for example, by working
with allies to limit the adoption of Huawei into 5G systems around the
world, as well as coordinating international pressure on China to adopt
disciplines on state subsidies. It also could involve joint efforts with
European allies to nudge China toward tightening pressure on Iran to
return to the nuclear negotiating table, and coordination with Japan and
South Korea to push China to increase the cost for North Korea of
continuing to pursue its nuclear and missile programs. [At its core,
though, a coherent policy process would be grounded in a focus on
America's main challenges and opportunities in the world, and an
awareness of how China relates to them. Great power competition would be
viewed as a means to an end]{.underline} and not as an end in itself.
There [will be areas where America's goals will be in direct tension
with those of China]{.underline}, such as on Taiwan and the sustainment
of America's alliance network in Asia. There will also be areas where
the U.S. and China will have overlapping interests, for example on
promoting sustainable global economic growth and curbing the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. A sober policy process
would be able to discriminate between the two areas in order to manage
friction while taking advantage of opportunities to enlist China's
contributions to challenges the U.S. cannot solve on its own.

[Scholars weigh in on Eugene Gholz's new paper, which argues that the
countries in the region can keep their own powers and rivalries in
check.]{.underline}

Is the United States truly ready to get its military forces out of the
Middle East? Should it? Considering there are upwards of 60,000 troops
in the region today, many of them stationed on bases in Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait, this is a question ripe for debate.

In a new paper for the Quincy Institute, [University of Notre Dame
scholar Eugene Gholz argues in detail that the fundamental reasons for
American military involvement there --- security, oil, human rights ---
no longer apply, and that staying there only emboldens the bad behavior
of regional actors.]{.underline} In his Gholz's words, "If the United
States is in fact interested in a more stable Middle East, it must
remove its weight from the scales and allow the region to recalibrate
according to its actual multipolar balance of power."

As such, he writes, Washington should start packing for a significant
military withdrawal over the next five to 10 years.

[Responsible Statecraft asked several Middle East and foreign policy
scholars to comment on Gholz's arguments, and to discuss whether this
dramatic shift is feasible and necessary for U.S. and regional
interests.]{.underline}

The 20th anniversary of 9/11 is almost upon us. In the two decades
since, we have spent billions of dollars in the Middle East to contain
terrorism, sold trillions of dollars worth of arms to our regional
allies, and built up our own military footprint in the Gulf to protect
American interests. What does the balance sheet look like as we approach
this anniversary? Was the treasure well-spent? Were American interests
well served?

As the curtain rises on the third decade after 9/11, the spotlight
inevitably focuses on what our national interests are in the Middle
East, and whether an extensive military footprint there is still
necessary. Both Presidents Obama and Trump, and indeed, now Biden, in
their own ways have pushed for a pivot away from the costly ventures in
the Middle East and toward a new focus on southeast Asia. Yet reducing
bases and troops is never easy, particularly as figuring out what
American interests actually are today in the Middle East --- beyond the
core principle of preserving and advancing the security of the American
people --- is still being debated.

Focusing in-depth on two main interests, preventing the rise of a
hostile regional hegemon and the interruption to the free flow of oil
through the Strait of Hormuz, [Eugene Gholz thoroughly debunks the need
for a permanent U.S. military presence to accomplish either, with the
overwhelming superiority of U.S. airpower being so definitive, and yet,
so easily able to be flown in when needed.]{.underline}

U.S. dominance is not where the nuance of his argument against a
permanent Middle East-based presence lies, however. It does not even lie
in his analysis of the failures of U.S. troop action in the Middle East
--- in the wars to stamp out terrorism, the inability to dissuade states
from acquiring a nuclear weapon, or the compromises made over the
protection of human rights.

[The argument's nuance lies in its highlighting an issue that is often
ignored because of what it says about American identity, but which is
critical to making a success out of next steps]{.underline}: that the
very presence of a behemoth the size and power of the U.S. military,
which of course is foreign to the region and naturally favors some
states against others, is actually working against core American
interests.

The heaviness of our presence sucks the oxygen out of local efforts to
establish working relationships between and with neighbors, such as the
Gulf states and Iran, which must exist proximate to each other
regardless of differences in religion or ideology. Our high troop
footprint stymies a sense of responsibility and ownership by the
community of Gulf and Middle East states to develop their own regional
security agreements, since those that are U.S. partners consider U.S.
military protection the better bet, even if it does mean internal
instability and conflict with neighbors. U.S. military presence is even
skewing the containment of today's fragmented form of terrorism by
making it a military rather than a policing and governance
responsibility --- generating blowback for an ongoing cycle of
terrorism.

The irony is, none of these issues have direct bearing on U.S. national
interests --- these are all local issues, and [Gholz rightly points out
they don't, even remotely, threaten the U.S. heartland. In other words,
we have become part of the problem over there --- and in the process, we
are neglecting the real threats to our national interests.]{.underline}

The Biden administration seems serious about wanting to revisit force
deployments globally. Eugene Gholz spells out many reasons why it should
start by reducing the U.S. military footprint in the Middle East.

"The current U.S. force posture in the region is not necessary to
guarantee U.S. interests," he explains. "At worst, the large presence of
the U.S. military undermines U.S. interests by contributing to
instability, which in turn can enmesh the United States in additional
conflicts."

Consider just three aspects of a very comprehensive paper: oil, regional
hegemony, and human rights.

Too many in the DC policy community still operate under assumptions
informed --- or, more accurately, misinformed --- by the Arab oil
embargoes of the 1970s, and by an energy market that has transformed
many times over since then. [Today, those who believe that ensuring the
flow of Middle Eastern oil is a vital U.S. interest are prepared to
expend considerable resources --- and risk the lives of American
servicemen and women --- in the service of that mission, but Gholz
conclusively demonstrates that fears of supply disruptions leading to
serious economic harm are overblown.]{.underline}

[A related but distinct alleged rationale for a substantial U.S.
military presence is to prevent the emergence of a regional hegemon.
But, once again, Gholz demolishes the suggestion that Iran --- or any
other aspirant --- is likely to prevail. Indeed, Gholz crafts an
exceptionally sophisticated and thorough argument documenting the many
reasons why establishing hegemony is extraordinarily difficult under any
circumstance --- and particularly so in today's Middle
East.]{.underline} This section alone is well worth the price of
admission.

Gholz points to yet another reason for questioning the net benefits of a
de facto permanent U.S. military presence in the Middle East --- the
undermining of Americans' professed commitment to democracy and human
rights. The U.S. government's long-standing support for autocratic
governments throughout the Middle East exposes Americans to charges of
hypocrisy and double standards.

Advocates for a U.S. military presence often invoke the argument that
these forces provide the United States with leverage, allowing
Washington to shape the region's long-term trajectory and, eventually,
enable democracy to prevail. But, as [Gholz wisely observes, given "that
many of America's strategic partners in the region are some of the
world's most notorious human rights violators, it is more reasonable to
conclude that the U.S. military presence in the region has served to
protect these regimes despite their human rights
violations."]{.underline} Claims that Americans care about the freedom
and general well-being of average men and women are belied by the
reality of the close --- and often personal --- connections that U.S.
foreign policy elites have with the region's privileged few.

Some realists may dismiss such concerns as ephemeral, but the high
levels of anti-American sentiment in the region derive, in part, from
the sense that American leaders talk out of both sides of their mouths
--- and this can produce grave consequences. In an earlier era,
following the revolution that overthrew the tyrannical Shah of Iran, the
people of Iran turned their ire toward the United States for having
installed and maintained him in power for decades. One can only imagine
how much anger and resentment has built up against the ruling classes in
other countries in the region, and how that animosity might someday be
directed against the American people.

In short, [Eugene Gholz has delivered an important report informed by
present realities, and well-suited to the future. Policymakers in the
Biden administration determined to craft a sustainable grand strategy
for the United States will find many useful insights here.]{.underline}

The large U.S. military footprint in the Middle East dates to the
reflagging of Kuwaiti oil tankers during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. It
ramped up further during the 1991 Gulf War to expel Iraq from Kuwait and
again after 2001 in the so-called "War on Terrorism" that featured
invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.

But the need for 50,000-plus troops permanently in the region is waning,
especially as the United States finally withdraws combat forces from
Afghanistan. With long-term bases in Germany and Italy and another
convenient location to the east of the region on the Indian Ocean island
of Diego Garcia, there is no reason for the United States to keep large
numbers of military personnel in perpetuity in the Arab countries
bordering the Persian Gulf.

[The arguments made by Eugene Gholz in the paper for the Quincy
Institute are sound. My only caveat is that I am not optimistic that,
left to their own devices, the countries in the region will be able to
create a new security architecture.]{.underline} Iran, despite decades
of sanctions, has shown an ability to exploit the internal weaknesses of
Arab countries through bankrolling local proxies and is unlikely to
stop.

Meanwhile, the Arab monarchies on the Persian Gulf have failed to
coordinate successfully. Smaller Arab states fear being dominated by
Saudi Arabia and losing freedom of maneuver. The failure of the Gulf
Cooperation Council after four decades to even coordinate missile
defenses --- not to mention the pointless Saudi and Emirati-led boycott
of Qatar from 2017 to 2021 --- is ample evidence of regional
dysfunction, even without taking into account the historic rivalry
between Sunni Arabs and Shiite Iran.

However, as the United States withdraws from the region, the need for
de-escalation of local conflicts intensifies. It is probably best served
by a continuation of bilateral talks between Iran and its neighbors,
especially Saudi Arabia. Such talks have already begun in Iraq and could
lead to a rapid restoration of diplomatic ties and people-to-people
contact including Iranian participation in the hajj and athletic and
cultural exchanges.

Normalization of Saudi-Iranian relations should also help reduce in
violence in Yemen, site of the world's largest humanitarian disaster.

The consolidation of power in Iran among conservatives after the June 18
presidential election might facilitate a decrease in regional tensions
as the incoming Raisi administration needs to focus on repairing Iran's
sanctions and COVID-battered economy. While Iran will not end its
alliances with non-state actors, it can be persuaded to encourage a
lighter footprint and less violent interaction with Sunni Arab-backed
groups.The entire region is suffering from the impact of the pandemic
and is looking toward a future of greener energy, threatening the main
source of hard currency, petrochemicals. It simply cannot afford new
wars or a constant stream of advanced armaments.

Instead of maintaining a large and costly military presence in the
region, the Biden administration should support any and all diplomatic
efforts aimed at reducing tensions. It should start by returning to
compliance with the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action --- assuming
Iran does so as well --- and reducing the potential for accidental
clashes with Iran in and around the Persian Gulf. In the event of a true
military emergency, the United States can always rapidly deploy. But a
constant presence is a recipe for intervention: when all you have is a
hammer, everything looks like a nail.

[Eugene Gholz has persuasively refuted the notions that the Middle East
is in danger of takeover by a regional hegemon and that oil from the
region could readily be interdicted enough to cripple the global
economy. That those notions are false flows not only from careful
analysis, as is found in Gholz's paper, of the relevant military
capabilities and challenges. It also is a matter of interests and
incentives.]{.underline}

endeavor]{.underline}. The book [introduces the LEAD dataset,
a]{.underline} major data collection effort that records the
characteristics and life experiences of leaders around the world during
1875--2004. Using these data, the authors study how [leaders'
characteristics affect their likelihood of initiating an international
military dispute]{.underline}. The book gives scholars and students not
only ideas about how the attributes of leaders could matter in
international relations, but provides a dataset that scholars can use to
make their new own discoveries. The [applications of the dataset are
virtually unlimited]{.underline} and will allow future scholars to study
how leaders' attributes affect any number of international and domestic
policies and outcomes.

Aside from these core theoretical contributions and impressive dataset,
the [book has many additional strengths. It]{.underline} anticipates and
[addresses a number of potential objections]{.underline} to the authors'
arguments that leaders matter, [including whether leaders are simply
conduits for policy rather than affecting policy
independently.]{.underline} The authors take various steps to account
for the fact that countries could be selecting leaders with certain
attributes, which could affect the [correlation between leader
attributes and the initiation of conflict]{.underline}. The authors are
also admirably clear that [leaders do not determine outcomes, but are
among many factors that contribute to decisions about
conflict,]{.underline} sometimes interacting with other variables such
as domestic institutions. I also find both the leader risk scores and
the analysis of systemic vs. leader-based factors to be interesting and
insightful, and its conclusions to be useful for policy makers. Finally,
the book contains helpful and interesting [narrative examples of how the
backgrounds of specific leaders from around the world might have
influenced their foreign policy decisions.]{.underline}

That said, like any book, Why Leaders Fight has some limitations. I will
focus on three here, all of which open up rich new areas for future
scholarship.

The first is that the book leans rather heavily toward the empirical
rather than the theoretical. While this is understandable given the
wealth of data the authors have to explore, their theoretical
expectations about specific leader-centric variables are often somewhat
equivocal. For one, it is not always evident whether the authors have a
specific logical reason to expect a certain direct relationship between
a leader's characteristics and conflict initiation; the theoretical
discussion is often agnostic, presenting theoretical conjectures as
possibilities to be evaluated empirically rather than on logical
grounds. In some cases, the authors barely discuss an anticipated
theoretical relationship at all, even when the results (shown in detail
in the helpful appendix) are suggestive of an empirical relationship.
For example, why is having a "creative" career associated with greater
conflict initiation? Why do those with experience as an interpreter
initiate less conflict? Why do older leaders initiate more conflict in
relatively democratic regimes, but not in autocratic ones? These are
theoretical questions that deserve more attention, although the sheer
number of variables admittedly makes that difficult.

A second, related issue has to do with the "why" -- the causal
mechanisms linking specific leader attributes to conflict initiation.
Returning to the example of leader age, what evidence do we have for why
age matters? The authors suggest that the answer has to do with the
leader's time horizons, but is that mechanism consistent with their
empirical finding that age does not matter in autocratic regimes, and
only in relatively more democratic regimes? (Figure 4.4). It seems that
time horizons should be less important in democracies, where leaders
face relatively short time horizons regardless of their age, due to term
limits. The authors offer ideas about the mechanisms linking many leader
attributes to conflict initiation, and their historical illustrations
often contain clues, but future work must assess why certain leader
attributes are correlated with conflict initiation.

A third concern is about what causal conclusions we can draw from the
evidence in the book. The authors are careful to refute the potential
objection that the results are due to selection bias, but an issue that
they do not address (at least in the book or the appendix) is about
specific modeling choices, particularly the decision to include so many
variables in the statistical analyses of specific leader attributes. One
potential problem in this vein is that many of the predictor variables
in the analyses may be causally related to each other (Angrist and
Pischke 2009). Rather than designing specific models to test the effects
of specific attributes, the analysis often errs on the side of inclusion
at the risk of bias. For example, the authors report that the findings
do not support a relationship between education and conflict initiation,
but the models used to reach that conclusion include measures of
occupation. Education is clearly related to many of the occupations
included in the analysis, such as law and medicine. The causal effects
of age are also difficult to discern. Regime type probably predicts
leader age (if not monotonically) because in some kinds of autocracies,
very young leaders can come to power. In democracies, in contrast, there
tend to be strict lower age limits. Age probably "causes" military
service, combat experience, witnessing a national war, divorce, and
number of total spouses. The military career and military service
variables are also probably causally related, and the military service
and national war participation variables may have a causal relationship
as well.2 Finally, regime type appears to be highly predictive of the
leader's gender, with extremely few nondemocratic leaders having been
women. Including all of these variables in the same model makes it
difficult to parse out the causal effect of each one.

In sum, [Why Leaders Fight is an important contribution to our
understanding of the causes of military conflict.]{.underline} The
authors bring to bear impressive amounts of data to explore the
relationship between individual leader attributes and military conflict,
while staying attentive to the possibility that systemic and domestic
variables could matter (or condition) the importance of individuals as
well. These ideas and data [provide countless avenues for future
scholarship on when, why, and how leaders matter for a host of questions
about international and domestic politics.3]{.underline}

#### Biden loves Ikenberry

**Hirsh 20** -- journalist, 12/5/20. (Michael, "Why Liberal
Internationalism Is Still Indispensable---and Fixable", Foreign Policy,

Joe Biden will enter office as America's 46th president next month in a
spirit of confidence for the future---but also with an almost
confessional sense of humility about the past. Because [Biden and his
top advisors seem acutely aware of just how badly they botched things
the last time they were in power. **One of their chief manifestos for
change**,]{.underline} as some of the incoming Bidenites have already
privately conceded, [**will be** G. John **Ikenberry's new book,** A
World Safe for Democracy.]{.underline} It is in some ways the crowning
achievement of the Princeton University's scholar's decadeslong work
explaining and defending the liberal international order[. Ikenberry's
research traces the origins of the liberal internationalist
project]{.underline}---the idea of building a community of nations based
on democracy, cooperation, and the rule of law---going back 200 years.
He chronicles it from its inception in the Age of Enlightenment and the
American and French revolutions to its near-dissolution in the post-Cold
War period under the neonationalist banner of its worst nemesis,
President Donald Trump. Ikenberry, in an interview, said that his
purpose was to "reframe the debate between nationalism and
internationalism" and acknowledge that American policymakers are now
dealing with a "liberal internationalism for wintertime rather than a
Francis Fukuyama-style liberal internationalism for springtime" of two
decades ago. (After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Fukuyama, the
Stanford political philosopher, famously suggested that the triumph of
democratic liberal capitalism over communism was so complete it could
constitute a kind of "end of history." This did not turn out to be the
case.) Ikenberry says that it's long past time for Biden and the
Democrats to acknowledge that rampaging American hubris after the Cold
War led to some of the worst mistakes ever made by liberal
internationalists of the modern era: from a Pollyannaish Reaganite
belief that neoliberalism (or capitalist free markets) would solve most
problems to the equally self-deluding notion that democracy would
achieve the same, especially in the Arab world (hence the disastrous
Iraq War). Along the way, he writes in his book, nations and especially
Washington lost the "shared narrative" of being a diverse but connected
international community and became more of a U.S.-manufactured "public
utility" dominated by the interests of multinational corporations. And
the former concept is what it must return to, he says. "The book tries
to provide the deeper theory of the liberal project that Biden is going
to try to renew," Ikenberry said. "I think it's the first book that
attempts to look at a whole tradition and cull it for usable knowledge
we can apply today. And to make the point that the post-1989 years
\[after the fall of the Berlin Wall\] were very much an anomaly. Two
centuries on, it's much more of a world-weary, contested run of
democracies struggling to build order." [According to a senior member of
the incoming Biden team, speaking on background, the new administration
is paying a great deal of attention to Ikenberry's ideas about
readdressing the problems of the American middle class that were
sacrificed to overzealous ideas of globalization.]{.underline}According
to a senior member of the incoming Biden team, speaking on background,
the new administration is paying a great deal of attention to
Ikenberry's ideas about readdressing the problems of the American middle
class that were sacrificed to overzealous ideas of globalization. [He
also said that reinventing liberal internationalism along the lines
Ikenberry recommends will be at the forefront of their
efforts.]{.underline} The incoming [Biden]{.underline} team [has already
conceded that both they and the Republicans, pre-Trump, lost their
way]{.underline}. They erred badly [because they "came to treat
international economic issues as somehow separate from everything
else,"]{.underline} as Biden's nominee to be national security advisor,
Jake Sullivan, wrote in the Atlantic in early 2019. Under both Democrats
and Republicans, "U.S. internationalism became insufficiently attentive
to the needs and aspirations of the American middle class." In a
remarkable admission, Sullivan, who served as then-Vice President
Biden's national security advisor, confessed: "During the Obama
administration, when the national-security team sat around the Situation
Room table, we rarely posed the question What will this mean for the
middle class? Many other countries have made economic growth that
expands the middle class a key organizing principle of their foreign
policy." [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [suffered a
dangerous, society-splitting populist backlash because it did not
address that same question, instead recklessly embracing global
neoliberalism, and engaging in a confident flinging-open of all
borders.]{.underline} The result was the loss of any sense that
internationalism was also a way of protecting social and economic
equity---the kind of compact that existed after World War II. Another
result was a series of policies and trade deals that opened the door to
the decimation of the American middle class, particularly to Chinese
competition. Beyond that, successive administrations, starting with
President Bill Clinton (but in which George W. Bush's administration was
particularly culpable in not punishing Chinese dumping and intellectual
property theft under World Trade Organization rules) allowed China to
flagrantly violate the rules of the game. The post-Cold War
internationalists failed equally in thinking they could easily co-opt
major illiberal states such as China and Russia fully into the global
system, Ikenberry writes. They did not. [The answer may be to make
liberal internationalism less "offensive" and intrusive. Instead "it
must define itself less as a grand vision of a global march toward an
ideal society, and more as a pragmatic, reform-oriented approach to
making liberal democracies safe."]{.underline} China, the major rival to
the United States, in particular could at least abide such an approach,
Ikenberry argues, because even in its rise to global dominance it is
still seeking to work within institutions like the United Nations, the
International Monetary Fund, and the WTO. "In effect this strategy calls
for making the liberal international order friendly to China and Russia
by stepping back from the vision of a one-world liberal order," he
writes. "The emphasis instead would be on coexistence, building on the
'defensive' liberal principles of self-determination, tolerance, and
ideological pluralism. Liberal internationalism would be made more
conservative." Or, some would say, more realist. [There is little doubt
about the direction the Bidenites will go, because all of them know---as
Ikenberry argues---that in the end there really is no
alternative.]{.underline} As Sullivan wrote last year: Trump's
neoisolationist approach "is dangerous, but he has surfaced questions
that need clear answers. Those of us who believe that the United States
can and should continue to occupy a global leadership role, even if a
different role than in the past, have to explain why Trump is
wrong---and provide a better strategy for the future. ... "This requires
domestic renewal above all, with energetic responses at home to the rise
of tribalism and the hollowing-out of the middle class." [Ultimately,
the challenges of modernity will require a reinvented liberal
internationalism because, Ikenberry argues, there really is no other
system available for dealing with "the problems of interdependence"
other than through international cooperation.]{.underline} Climate
change, pandemics like COVID-19, nuclear proliferation---all can only be
solved through the established global system. "The pandemic is the
poster child of that problem," he said in the interview. But even here
the United States must adopt more realist approaches to liberal
internationalism. "The problem of liberal internationalism is about
managing interdependence, not globalizing the world," he said. Ikenberry
concludes that liberal internationalism must recreate itself as a more
restrained version of President Woodrow Wilson's original vision of
making the world "safe for democracy." But this, again, is likely to be
more a defensive than offensive approach. And at home, Ikenberry says,
it means finding a brand-new way of making internationalism work for
average Americans, especially with labor and environmental protections.
The idea of "protectionism" can no longer simply be anathema. Indeed,
Trumpist populism will not disappear under Biden. He has already
advocated a \$700 billion-plus "Buy American" plan and conditioned his
return to the Trans-Pacific Partnership he once advocated on greater
worker protections. His political platform sounds a not a little
Trumpian as well, declaring he will "ensure the future is 'made in all
of America' by all of America's workers." [Biden will also continue a
campaign begun by]{.underline} former President Barack
[Obama]{.underline}---but turned into a strident war by
Trump---[pressuring European allies to pay their fair share of the
Atlantic alliance and NATO.]{.underline} In the end, [Biden's return to
liberal internationalism will be real]{.underline}, but more demanding
of other nations, as was Trump's. Above all, [his approach will focus
first at home,]{.underline} on the pandemic and joblessness. "Looking
over 200 years," Ikenberry said, "[one of the things I found and which
the Biden administration intuitively understands is that in every period
where a golden era of internationalism that lifted America to greater
heights existed, it was tied to a progressive agenda."]{.underline}
Restoring this vision means going back to the nationalist origins of
internationalism, how it arose out of the wars of the 19th century, the
industrial revolution, and, in hands of proto-internationalists such as
the British politician Richard Cobden, how it became a means to global
hegemony and economic prosperity for its first great practitioner,
Britain. Cobden spoke of free trade and peace as "one and the same
cause," and at the same time new forms of social internationalism also
sprung up, pushing for equanimity for all social classes. The new
concept of Adam Smith-conceived free trade presaged "the dissolution of
empire, the ending of territorial annexation and the abandonment of
aristocratic militarism," as the British historian Anthony Howe argues.
It presaged the modern world, in other words, culminating, ultimately,
in the international community institutions proposed by Wilson and
imposed and perfected by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. But
institutions that were always meant to benefit all Americans. These
changes in the international system are now so entrenched they cannot
simply be undone. Yet they remain badly misdirected at present.
Somewhere along the line the idea of internationalism became, rather
than a means to achieve the end of national prosperity and peace,
instead an end in itself. And this is where policymakers went wrong. In
Washington, especially, the domestic impact of liberalization was
consistently played down by both Republican and Democratic
administrations. The post-Cold War globalization of free trade did
indeed create, as the economists predicted, more global equality and
prosperity overall. Bu[t in the past few decades far more of that
equality and prosperity has accrued to developing nations than to the
working classes of the champions of globalization like the United States
and Europe, where growing inequality has engendered a long-term populist
reaction, one that is unlikely to disappear any time soon. As a result,
Ikenberry said, "I think we're in for a kind of managed openness that
allows us to protect environmental and labor standards, so as to shore
up the democracies.]{.underline}" Even Ikenberry admits there is a long
way to go in restoring faith in liberal internationalism in Washington,
especially now that the problems of modernity "are like Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde. There are greater opportunities with technologies and
innovation but also greater perils." Cyber-misinformation, for one
thing, that emerged out of the very technology that was supposed to
bring us closer together: the internet. "Functioning liberal democracy
requires some factual agreed-upon knowledge base," said Ikenberry, and
yet Trump showed that he could exploit the fact that there was no longer
such an agreed-upon base---no direction home to broadly established
economic and social truths. In the end, Ikenberry calls for a new
"Wilsonian moment" but he appears to think it will be something very
different from what Wilson himself conceived a century ago. In the
interview Ikenberry conceded: "Some will say what we are introducing is
a kind of illiberal internationalism instead."

With Bob Kagan's latest book---"The Jungle Grows Back: America and Our
Imperiled World"---now the talk of the town (along with one or two other
things!), it is time to say it: [I am a Kaganite. To be sure, I have
some differences with Bob, but there is no modern author who has taught
me more, or changed the way I view the world more, than he
has.]{.underline} Often, modern liberalism seems to place too much faith
in institutions and in the inevitable progress of human civilization.
Realism often errs in the other direction, and can be cynical and
deterministic. Neo-conservatism places too much stock in American
exceptionalism and tends towards overconfidence about the use of U.S.
power. These three paradigms leave me wanting. To my mind, a [Kaganite
believes most or all of the following: The post-1945 order is indeed
"the world America made" and still depends largely on **American power**
to undergird it;]{.underline} For all its failings, and all of America's
many mistakes, that very [successful world order has been an historical
anomaly and it is now in significant peril; The order's fragility is due
to the facts that humans and their institutions remain deeply
flawed.]{.underline} Left unchecked, the jungle will indeed grow back
(or, as Bob writes: "The liberal world order is like a garden, ever
under siege from the forces of history, the jungle whose vines and weeds
constantly threaten to overwhelm it"); Americans are not necessarily
smarter or more ethical than others. Indeed, over its history, America
has been a "dangerous nation," especially and at first in our own
Western hemisphere. Americans come from mythical Mars in terms of their
assertiveness and their willingness to use force. The narrative we often
tell ourselves---that Americans would prefer isolationism and pacifism
if the world would just leave us alone---is a myth; [The geographic
position of the United States, and the fact that it is a melting-pot
nation deriving its identity and its purpose chiefly from a set of ideas
and ideals, mean that it has a special ability---and thus a **special
responsibility**---to **undergird the global order**, especially in
terms of security and economics;]{.underline} Yet most Americans do not
understand or accept these realities. They need to be constantly
reminded and persuaded; Progress in world politics is not impossible,
but it is always difficult and always fragile. It is also reversible;
and Despite what is often stated as fact, [America is not a status-quo
power. It is a **disruptive forc**e in world politics, unapologetically
promoting **democracy** and **market-based economics** as well as
**human rights**.]{.underline} Nor should it apologize. I have my
differences with Bob: His new book seems slightly too dark about the
state of the world, and nuclear deterrence and memories of the world
wars may help us keep the peace more than he thinks. New threats like
climate change and massive urbanization around the world may deserve a
more central place in his strategic framework. China may merit slightly
more empathy as a rising power than he grants it (though only slightly
more, I concede). But for [identifying and clearly explaining the chief
forces driving human history, **Bob is brilliant**. **Few rival him**,
and **few write as well** either. At least at this juncture **in U.S.

In fact, there are [many evidences support Mearsheimer's
predictions]{.underline}. For instance, in terms of [the shift in the
balance of power]{.underline}. Arguably, the three decades of the
growing economic development placed China as the second largest economy
in the world. The economic estimations assert that China's economy would
be the number one by 2020 (Logan, 2013, p. 2). However, the most
importantly, China since the 2000s, has been translating this economic
power to military might and global influence. For instance, China
tripled its military spending during the period from 2000 to 2011
(Mislan, 2017). In fact, [this huge spending on military power means the
compromise the balance of power in Asia in favor of China]{.underline}.
On the other hand, it [gives an indication that China actually seeks to
be a regional hegemony]{.underline}. The assertiveness and strictness of
China's foreign policy, particularly in the SCS since 2008, are another
important indication of the Mearsheimer's predictions. Moreover, China's
foreign policy since 2008 has become a more stringent in many
flashpoints issues with the USA such as climate change, North Korea,
Taiwan and Iran ([Anderson and Cha,

An [example f]{.underline}or the [ineffectiveness of basing foreign

needed most to defeat the emerging threat]{.underline}" from terrorist
groups (2008, p. 159). This misunderstanding resulted in ignoring two
key elements of soft power: the Bush administration firstly forgot about
the USA's dependence on their allies' intelligence and policy forces and
on global public support; and secondly, the question of the legitimacy
of the invasion was not attributed any importance (ibid., p. 160). In
the short term, t[hese mistakes led to the failure of the action. In the
long term, they have **caused the degradation of American soft power as
"the strategy undermined the U.S. global position"**]{.underline}
(ibid., p. 160) [and "global public confidence in U.S.

this damage for instance when facing problems of their development aid

the]{.underline} above mentioned [factors limiting the effectiveness of
hard power, it is **hard to find successful foreign policies solely

soft power]{.underline} rather than hard in its external relations.
India's foreign policy for instance is presently within the process of
this transition. Wagner lists two main reasons for this transition: On
the one hand, "[India's hard power approach]{.underline} of the 1970s
and 1980s [was not very successful"]{.underline} (Wagner, 2005, p. 2);
and on the other hand, the economic advancement after 1991 facilitated
the use of economic tools in foreign policy (ibid.). This explanation
mirrors some of the above mentioned factors triggering the decline in
the use of hard power.
