[Taking a **feminist approach** to NATO also addresses a **key gap** in
the field]{.underline}. It provides a cornerstone to addressing Enloe's
(1993: 203) concerns that: We \[[feminist **scholars**]{.underline}\]
[know]{.underline} all [**too little** about the **internal** cultural
**dynamics** of **institutions** such as **NATO**. This **ignorance**
prevents us as **analysts** of internationalized political culture from
determining whether and how genuinely new concepts of 'enemy', 'threat',
and 'security' are **trickling** through the **alliance's**
**bureaucratic layers**.]{.underline} [Nor can we tell how]{.underline}
(I don't believe we need an 'if') these [possible cultural
transformations are reshaping NATO's own gendered culture]{.underline}.
We need feminist anthropologists to imagine their 'field' as lying
inside NATO's Brussels headquarters.

While we imagine our 'field' as lying inside NATO, from the outset of
this project we have been aware of the challenges of doing this. In
particular, in [gaining **access** to an **institution** necessarily
steeped in **secrecy** given its role in international **security** and
**defence**]{.underline}. Our unique scholar-practitioner authorial
partnership has helped us to better imagine NATO. For example, Gil
Ruiz's expertise as the former Chief of the Gender Advisor Office
International Military Staff (IMS), including responsibility for
supporting the organisation of the NCGP Annual Conferences from 2012 to
2015, has provided invaluable in-depth insight. This has [equipped us
with a working knowledge of the NCGP from an **'insider' perspective**,
something **academic 'outsiders'**, even with **privileged access** to
the **institution** can **never** fully '**know'**.]{.underline} This
[synergy of **practitionerscholar perspectives** offers a novel
understanding of NATO and its engagement with gender, one that is
**unique** within the **current literature**]{.underline}.

Feminist knowledge of NATO is integral to addressing these questions.
The [**study** of an **institution** does not have to **correlate**
with]{.underline} an [**endorsement** of their **politics** and
**practices**]{.underline} (Holmes et al., 2019). [It is possible to
remain a '**critical friend**'.]{.underline} A concept we introduce in
the introduction to this book. This builds on the work of Rech et al.
(2015: 56) who contend

that the [**study** of the military, of militarism, and of processes of
**militarisation**, should not be undertaken **solely** for its own
**sake**, but]{.underline} should also by [guided by the **possibility**
of **engagement** with the **forces** and **institutions responsible**,
and should not be **bashful** about doing so]{.underline}.

This is because such [institutions, including **NATO**, are ultimately
**accountable** to the **civilian world** and **understanding** how they
**function** is necessary to **critique them** (rather than **dismiss
them**)]{.underline} (Enloe, 1993; Rech et al., 2015: 56). Being a
'critical friend' means [adopting a critical approach which calls these
institutions into question and accounts for the **possibility of
change**, supporting a **normatively guided approach**]{.underline}
(Cox, 1981: 129--30). [It entails **engaging** in **complex** and
nuanced arguments and situating these in broader political
considerations and in more **nuanced ways** than **simplistic**
'**pro-military**' or '**anti-military**' **positions** are able to
accommodate]{.underline} (Rech et al., 2015: 56; Duncanson, 2013). It
means a [commitment to **praxis**]{.underline}, which [necessities
**engagement**]{.underline}. Military [institutions are often
**secretive**, **complex** and **contradictory**, this means **critical
agendas** can be **vulnerable** to **co-option**]{.underline} (as we go
on to discuss in Chapter 4). Being a 'critical friend' therefore
[**necessitates** engaging in a process of **reflexivity** throughout
the **research** process]{.underline}.

For Cohn (2011: 585), [feminist scholars at the epicentre of
'military/political/economic power' in Europe and the United States have
a responsibility to build knowledge of them]{.underline}. Basu finds
[there is also **space** to **build knowledge** of **institutions** from
**multiple-sites** to **enrich** our **understanding** of how they
function]{.underline} (Holmes et al., 2019). Drawing on her research on
the UN Security Council, she asks feminist scholars to consider 'what
does the Council look like from different parts of the world?' (Holmes
et al., 2019). The same question could be asked of NATO given its shift
to become a globally engaged actor post-Cold War. Thomson (2018: 6)
argues that the [engagement of such institutions with the WPS agenda
necessities building feminist knowledge of them]{.underline}. She is
right, however, this should not be the only impetus for such a move.
[**Building** feminist **knowledge** of how institutions such as **NATO
function** is **imperative** to support the **transformation** of the
**current global order** in line with **gender** just
goals]{.underline}.

[Feminist knowledge building of international institutions
becomes]{.underline} all the more [**necessary** for critical feminist
IR as a project]{.underline} if we conceive of IR and international
relations as co-constitutive. [In **leaving** the **study** of
institutions such as **NATO** to '**mainstream**' IR
**scholars**]{.underline}, we [**neglect** the possibilities for
**change** and **resistance** in the international system. The existing
global order, of which NATO is part, is **gendered**, **racialised** and
**classed**. In order to transform it, we need to
**politicise**]{.underline} 'which and when differences matter; why
[inequalities]{.underline} persist; and where military women and men are
not equally recognised, positioned or privileged' (Henry, 2018: 2).

In a military context, [hegemonic masculinity has been used to explain
why it is that the creation of the 'New Man]{.underline}' (for example,
the heroic peacekeeper, the humanitarian soldier scholar) has not
resulted in gender equality or for that matter, genuine peace and
security on many military interventions. Yet, perhaps [the utility of
the concept leads to too **hasty conclusions** in **feminist
scholarship**; **NATO** as an **institution** to the **automatic
assumption** that **change** in **masculinities** is little more than
the '**flexibility** of the machinery of **rule**]{.underline}'
(Duncanson, 2013: 71). [Duncanson offers an important note of
**caution** on the **negative connotations** of **appropriation**,
change and transformation of hegemonic masculinity, stating that it is
too **deterministic**.]{.underline} She argues that '[there is
**nothing** in the **concept** itself which **necessitates** an
**interpretation** that]{.underline} it [always **inevitably shifts** in
order that men **retain power**; that it can never be **transformed**,
dismantled]{.underline}' (Duncanson, 2013: 63).

Connell and Messerschmidt argue that research on hegemonic masculinity
'needs to give much closer attention to the practices of women and to
the historical interplay of femininities and masculinities' (Connell and
Messerschmidt, 2005: 848). To do so, [it is necessary to **centralise
interaction** of women and men, of masculinities and femininities in and
through **specific institutional practices**]{.underline}. In doing so,
we provide examples of understanding the construction of particular
hegemonic and subordinate masculinities and femininities within NATO. It
is therefore [**necessary** to avoid **essentialism**, and **assumed
(negative) types**]{.underline}, while acknowledging the fluidity and
hybridity between masculinities and femininities. Hegemonic masculinity
therefore remains a valuable theoretical and analytical tool,
particularly when applied to a militarised institutional setting such as
NATO.

#### Perm solves -- transition does NOT entail complete [rejection]{.underline} NOR [embrace]{.underline} of [hybrid masculinities]{.underline} -- solves any [residual link]{.underline}

[There]{.underline} therefore [remain **possibilities** to **displace
hegemonic masculinity**]{.underline} (Connell, 2005; Connell and
Messerschmidt, 2005). Even if these [possibilities have been **lost in
application** empirical case studies]{.underline}. As Duncanson (2015:
244) argues, to realise this, '[hierarchical relations must be replaced
with relations of equality, mutual respect, or empathy]{.underline}'.
She critiques Connell's (2002) suggestion that [the **transition phase**
should be one where a **masculinity open to equality** within women is
**hegemonised**.]{.underline} Rather, [the transitory stage has to be
one where traditionally disparaged, feminized traits are **newly
valued** and **incorporated** into '**softer**' or **hybrid
masculinities**.]{.underline}

The forging of more equal relations is the ultimate, more challenging
stage. The [hybrid stage may make it more likely that relations of
**equality**, **mutual respect**, **empathy**, and so on, are
**formed**]{.underline}, however, so [rather than **dismiss** the **New
Man** syndrome in all its contexts, assuming it always camouflages the
continuation of patriarchy, militarism, and neoliberalism, we can look
to **expose** its **contradictions** and to **push for** those
**relations of equality**]{.underline}.

### 2AC Fem IR AT: Vulnerability 

#### Vulnerability fails -- doesn't adress material inequalities, sidelines communities who choose protection, and victim blames those who refuse their method 

**Cole 16** (Alyson Cole, Queens College and the Graduate Center of the
City University of New York, "All of Us Are Vulnerable, But Some Are
More Vulnerable than Others: The Political Ambiguity of Vulnerability
Studies, an Ambivalent Critique", A Journal of Philosophy and Social
Theory, Volume 17, 2016 - Issue 2: The Politics of Vulnerability,

Dynamics of transvaluation

Resignifying vulnerability requires a somewhat different approach than
other feminist efforts to elevate and promote previously devalued
concepts and ways of being, such as care-giving. [The fundamentally
negative connotations associated with vulnerability cannot be simply
inverted.]{.underline} Scholars endeavour to recast vulnerability as a
primary condition of trans-subjectivity that goes much further beyond
the potential to be injured. Gilson, for example, argues that
"vulnerability is not, essentially, about suffering ... nor is it ...
merely a way of being susceptible to harm."23 [In her formulation, the
reflexive association of vulnerability with harm is responsible for the
privatization of responsibility.]{.underline} To avoid this impediment
she argues that we must revise our conception of vulnerability in at
least two ways -- from fixity to potentiality, and from negativity to
ambiguity.24

Might vulnerability scholars be overstating their case? As a
prerequisite for addressing injustice and inequality, they insist that
we must first recognize our constitutive vulnerability[. However,
acknowledging vulnerability, now redefined as a universal condition
encompassing beneficial possibilities (intimate relationships, for
instance), could in fact prevent us from clearly perceiving what
differentiates our vulnerability from the vulnerability of others.
Emphasizing vulnerability as "potentiality," moreover, obscures the
(temporal) distinction between a general susceptibility to harm and the
actual injuries that specific individuals and communities already
endure. Grappling with prospective harm, we may well elide entrenched
disparities of dominance and inequality that produce enduring, negative
vulnerabilities.]{.underline}

How we experience our common condition of vulnerability differs greatly
(who is more sickly, who is more impoverished). This is a structural
matter as well as an experiential one. [People are subjected to or
immunized from vulnerability in radically distinct, different and
unequal ways. Given the structural differentiation in who suffers which
vulnerabilities, our ontological commonality takes us only so far. While
accepting the vulnerability we all share, uncovering its enabling
aspects, and perhaps even cultivating "epistemic vulnerability," are
worthy undertakings; the vulnerabilities that demand our urgent
attention are those that deepen inequality and inflict
harm]{.underline}.

Furthermore, as these scholars ask us to embrace a more expansive
understanding of vulnerability, [they still preserve and frequently
employ the conventional and narrower use of the term "vulnerable" as a
designation of harm and oppression. Such ambiguity is not incidental but
intrinsic to their project]{.underline}. Retaining the now-doubled
meaning of the term, scholars insist on basic, inescapable principles
that are shared by all permutations of vulnerability. They semantically
re-situate vulnerability-as-harm in a significantly richer range of
human interactivity, thereby naturalizing its presence and disarming the
potential threat that intensifies social divisions and propels the
pursuit of invulnerability. [Upholding vulnerability-as-harm and the
more inclusive vulnerability-as-interconnectivity under a single
designation, however, exacerbates the risk of conflating the two. Such
linguistic slippage, which the literature actually encourages, becomes
ever more problematic when scholars accentuate the positive, generative
dimensions of our susceptibility or openness to others. In this way,
transvaluing vulnerability could unintentionally muddle and occlude its
negative effects]{.underline}.

Some vulnerability scholars anticipate this criticism, at least
implicitly, and offer refinements through adjectival modifiers. Derek
Sellman refers to those who are "more-than-ordinarily vulnerable," for
instance, although the principle of differentiation among gradations of
vulnerability remains tenuous.25 Butler, to give another example,
distinguishes between ontological and situational vulnerability; in
other words, between the vulnerability that is a condition of life
(precariousness) and the vulnerabilities that are embedded in specific
structures of power (precarity).26 Mackenzie et al. go further and
construct a taxonomy that separates inherent, situational and pathogenic
vulnerabilities.27 Still, the criteria for distinguishing and the
relationship between various forms of vulnerabilities are
undertheorized.

More importantly, pr[omoting an exceedingly expansive conception of
vulnerability and, concurrently, rigidly differentiating its numerous
manifestations, seems contradictory. Such taxonomies have the potential
of generating new binaries and hierarchies.]{.underline} Perhaps this is
why Fineman refuses to parse vulnerability. She acknowledges that
vulnerabilities vary qualitatively and quantitatively, but focuses
instead on the resources (physical, human, social, environmental and
existential) which an individual controls.28 "[Designating only certain
individuals and groups as vulnerable," she warns, "transforms our shared
vulnerability into a personal liability and renders the individuals so
designated susceptible to alienation, stigma, or
demonization]{.underline}."29 Conceiving of "differently vulnerable"
subjects, Fineman considers a ruse of liberalism attached to the
vulnerable/invulnerable binary: "The most pernicious effect of the
segmenting of a general population so that only some are designated as
vulnerable ... is that such segmentation suggests that the rest of us
are not vulnerable."30 [Like Fineman, the field as a whole seems more
invested in presenting vulnerability as being foremost universal, always
ambivalent and ambiguous, at a distance from questions of power and
politics. The concept has been rendered so broad as to obscure the needs
of specific groups and individuals, undermining its promise as a
conceptual frame to understand and challenge systemic
inequalities.]{.underline}

Just as the relationship between different vulnerabilities [requires
further explication, so too does the trajectory from acknowledging
constitutive vulnerability to identifying and remedying concrete
inequalities and injustice.]{.underline} "It remains unclear," as Murphy
observes of Butler\'s discussion about how vulnerability can fuel both
violence and a politics of nonviolence, "what norms would be at play in
an attempt to derive a substantive ethics (or politics) from a
constitutive and primordial exposure to others."31 Similarly, as she
promotes epistemic and other forms of vulnerability, Gilson also [points
to specific cases in which individuals and communities might rightly
reject cultivating vulnerability and instead pursue closure as a
protective posture to resist oppression.]{.underline} She claims that
this sort of vulnerability management differs from valorizing
invulnerability because it is strategic and selective. ["\[O\]ne does
not ignore and deny vulnerability per se, but refuses the experience of
vulnerability in particular case]{.underline}s."32 What would be the
general principle to guide us in determining whether to be more or less
vulnerable? How would the line between what is strategic and what is
constitutive be determined? As an effort to advance an ethical posture
towards political questions (I will return to this point later)
vulnerability studies provide largely a pre-ethical premise, as Murphy
suggests. [Beyond general allusions to injustice and inequality we need
to rely on supplemental approaches, ethical or otherwise, for any clear
course of action.]{.underline}

Several scholars propose that thinking of vulnerability as a spectrum on
which we all occupy different places at different times would alter the
frames of intelligibility (in Butler\'s account), and address the a
priori disavowal of the "more-than-ordinarily vulnerable" (to use
Sellman\'s phrase). "If we came to terms with the fact that we are all,
by definition, characterized by vulnerability," Carine Mardorossian
avers, "then it becomes difficult (if not impossible) to hold it against
people that they are vulnerable."33 Is such optimism merited? [Do we
discipline the vulnerable primarily because of a failure to recognize
our shared condition and the potentialities it enables? Or, is it
instead that the mistreatment of the most vulnerable derives from a more
substantial and complex investment in systems of power and material
benefits]{.underline}? This was William Ryan\'s point in his examination
of policies designed during the late 1960s to address urban poverty,
crime and violence in the United States. [Rather than focus on
structural, economic factors that produce and perpetuate vulnerability,
these well-meaning policymakers found fault instead with the behaviour
and values of vulnerable populations, and designed policies to reform
them.]{.underline} Such twisted logic Ryan provocatively called "blaming
the victim." According to Ryan, [victim blaming emerges from
"systematically motivated, but unintended, distortions of reality ...
rooted in a class-based interest in maintaining the status quo."34
Furthermore, he demonstrated that it is precisely those who are
especially receptive to vulnerable others who end up blaming them. In a
"sub-conscious reconciliation" of opposing self-interests and
humanitarian "impulses," these otherwise empathic individuals attribute
responsibility to the vulnerable for their condition in order to justify
the current socioeconomic structures that privilege them as members of
capitalist society\'s elites]{.underline}.35 The obstacle, in other
words, is material and psychological more than epistemological.

Relatedly, [the question remains in what way vulnerability studies could
facilitate interventions or remedies to inequality that are
substantially different from those already available]{.underline}.
Fineman, for instance, aims with her "vulnerable subject" to impart an
alternative heuristic to compel governmental and legal responsiveness.
Her criticisms of the limits of the current equal treatment doctrine in
addressing inequality, which is the impetus for her theorizing
vulnerability, are compelling. However, she offers [little specificity
about what precisely institutions might do to better respond to
vulnerability, and she does not consider the ways in which these same
institutions create and perpetuate vulnerability]{.underline}.36
Moreover, as Alexandra Timmer surmises from an analysis of the European
Court of Human Rights, a body already employing the category of
vulnerability, the "vulnerable subject" has not displaced the liberal
subject. She notes that the vulnerability construct may enable the court
to be more context-sensitive, impact caseload management and help in
elaborating positive obligations, but the evidence is modest.37

#### Calls for vulnerability lack political work necessary to engage the most vulnerable

Vulnerable politics

Butler envisages that the general condition of precariousness can serve
as a "basis for community." "Precarity" (in distinction to
"precariousness"), she specifies, is a "politically induced condition."
She elaborates that vulnerability is inseparable from "that dimension of
politics that addresses the organization and protection of bodily
needs," and, further, that "minimizing the condition of precariousness
in egalitarian ways remains one task for politics." True enough, but
what are the politics of vulnerability? What sort of political claim
does vulnerability enunciate? Can the language of vulnerability
articulate what Jacques Rancière depicts as "the naming of the wrong?"
This concern encompasses two sets of issues: first, the relationship
between ontology, ethics and politics; second, the politicization of the
most vulnerable. For some, the theoretical move to foreground
ontological vulnerability signals the displacement of politics by ethics
-- what Bonnie Honig, in another context, labels an "anti-politics of
grief," which she contends is central to a new, and inherently
post-political, "mortalist humanism." Critics of the so-called "ethical
turn," such as Honig and Rancière, tend to reify the political.
Nevertheless, [concerns over how prioritizing the ethical typically
dilutes fundamental dynamics of politics]{.underline}, to wit struggle
and conflict (what Rancière identifies as "politics' core -- namely
dissensus"), [as well as the ways in which power delimits what ethics
can be realized, or even perceived, require consideration. After all,
ethics might help us to identify questions of justice, but determining
the line between misfortune and injustice, or the suffering we
ultimately must resign ourselves to, and that we can fight to change, is
an inherently political question]{.underline}, as Judith Shklar
powerfully argues. And, there will be fierce disagreement:
"\[P\]olitical predicates are open predicates: they open up a dispute
about what they exactly entail and whom they concern in which cases."
Rancière, in his critique of Emanuel Levinas\'s formulation, rejects the
possibility that empathy with the vulnerable can ground politics. As he
explains, attempts to assist the vulnerable-as-vulnerable perpetuate
rather than destabilize asymmetrical relations. [Collapsing the
political with ethical community, moreover, leads to "radical ethical
indistinction" and the fantasy of "consensual politics]{.underline}."
The wrong articulated in politics exceeds competing interests, and
therefore cannot be resolved through negotiation. It is, rather, a
challenge to the very order of society, a demand for a fundamental
restructuring. With Rancière, I tend to think that [vulnerability
presents a problematic entry into politics; it must be from a position
of equality that we align ourselves politically in solidarity with the
most vulnerable.]{.underline} In order for the most vulnerable to engage
in politics and thus constitute a political subject, it is precisely
that inequality, that asymmetry of power, which serves as the starting
point. Grief and lamentation are not necessarily political, but
complaint is. As a malleable and ambiguous condition (to follow the
recent redefinition of the concept), vulnerability requires translation
for politics, in order to "name the wrong." To claim a wrong is to enact
an ethics, but in a political form and language. [Vulnerability has to
be reframed as a claim about injustice. Because of its determinedly
prospective temporality, vulnerability lacks urgency and makes no
immediate demand. It thus cannot easily yield the moment of (Rancierian)
politics: "a determined kind of speech situation]{.underline}: in which
one of the interlocutors at once understands and does not understand
what the other is saying." Victimization can more easily produce such
moments. Consider the recent Black Lives Matter protests. These
demonstrations most certainly entailed mourning, and were a powerful and
poignant response to persistent "racial vulnerability." However, the
"mode of address" (to borrow a Butlerian phrase) was devoid of any
ambiguity or ambivalence. Public expressions of grief were combined with
righteous, outraged assertions of equality. "Black Lives Matter"
semantically opposes not "racial vulnerability," but death, and what
Michael Eric Dyson has called "slow terror." [This is not simply an
issue of rhetoric (the die-ins were silent, after all), but the terms of
political engagement matter. Without rightly naming their condition,
understanding -- even for those who endure mistreatment -- as well as
the possibility for change are limited]{.underline}. Recall James
Baldwin\'s searing indictment in The Fire Next Time: "For the horrors of
the American Negro\'s life there has been almost no language. Some have
taken umbrage with the specificity of the rallying cry, implying that
the mantra should assert the value of all life instead. [Such universal
truisms evade the issue, "water\[ing it\] down with a generic feel-good
catchphrase," and thus evacuating it of its political force. Might a
similar criticism be applied to the universal iteration of
vulnerability?]{.underline} Black Lives Matter provides an illustration
of addressing a universal condition through a specific case. Feminists
have long been wary of the latent particularity of universalisms, at
least since Simone de Beauvoir\'s observation that "man represents both
the positive and the neutral." Most have argued instead for "making a
universally applicable change ... through embracing, not through
obscuring or denying or eliding particularity." [In contrast, the
vulnerability literature focuses primarily on promoting an affective
attunement to a condition of generality, presuming that recognizing our
shared vulnerability will inevitably generate responsiveness to
vulnerability in general.]{.underline} Vulnerability might be
productively conceived as an affective posture and/or an epistemology,
but the literature falls short by ending there. [Scant attention is paid
to explicating the content of, and what will promote, "political
responsibility." In this way, the thoughtful work on vulnerability risks
becoming another manifestation of what Lauren Berlant characterized as
"trauma\'s seduction of politics," whereby the dynamics of dominance and
inequality shift towards questions of feeling.]{.underline} Reflecting
on the case of Black Lives Matter also suggests that [the project of
vulnerability studies constitutes an effort to address the
epistemological ignorance of the privileged, theorizing vulnerability
predominantly from their point of view. It remains unclear what benefit
the acceptance of constitutive vulnerability offers the
disadvantaged]{.underline}. Similarly, Rancière\'s account of the
political reminds us of [the importance of positionality and helps to
distinguish between competing vantage points -- between those who,
prompted by their exclusion ("the part of those who have no-part"), make
the political claim, and others]{.underline}. In sum, scholars rightly
question the reductive association of vulnerability with weakness and
helplessness, expose the dangers and futility of the quest for
invulnerability (which might be the literature\'s most significant
contribution) and productively amplify the enabling aspects of
vulnerability. Nevertheless, [the language of vulnerability may not be
able to perform the political work the most vulnerable require and
deserve. We will not know the full potential of vulnerability as a
critical category until scholars directly engage the demands and
dynamics of politics.]{.underline}
