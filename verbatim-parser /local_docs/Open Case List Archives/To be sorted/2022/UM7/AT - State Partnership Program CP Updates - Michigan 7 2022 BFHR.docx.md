[[The]{.mark} [National Guard program]{.mark} that pairs up states with
partner countries for training [needs to improve its
record-keeping,]{.mark} according to the recommendations from a
[G]{.mark}overnment [A]{.mark}ccountability [O]{.mark}ffice report
[released Wednesday]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The [S]{.mark}tate
[P]{.mark}artnership [P]{.mark}rogram [implemented]{.mark} [a new
tracking database]{.mark} in 2021, according to the report, [but partner
countries haven't been thorough in reporting]{.mark} of all of the
training events they've completed with their National Guard
counterparts.]{.underline} During fiscal year 2021, for example, [[37 of
780 activities]{.mark} were [marked]{.mark} as [completed, just
5%.]{.mark} It's up to the National Guard Bureau to make sure that
partners update their records, so that Congress can continue to
appropriately fund the program, but [GAO found]{.mark} that [they
haven't been following up]{.mark} to make sure records are
complete]{.underline}. "[[If]{.mark} the [NGB]{.mark}
[prioritizes]{.mark} ensuring that partner states are [recording]{.mark}
such [info]{.mark}rmation in a timely manner,]{.underline} [[DoD will be
positioned]{.mark} to have [reliable info]{.mark}rmation [for internal
decision-making purposes and]{.mark} for reporting to Congress as the
data system continues to evolve," the report said. The [Defense]{.mark}
[Department]{.mark} [agreed]{.mark} with GAO's recommendation, [but did
not offer examples]{.mark} of how it plans to improve reporting. GAO
will update its report when DoD has confirmed its next
steps]{.underline}. [The report also [found]{.mark} some [confusion at
both NGB and DoD]{.mark} about the legal [authorities that govern SPP
training and travel]{.mark}. "While DoD has approved establishing a
working group to review and clarify the use of statutory authorities for
SPP activities, DoD has not ensured that the action plan describing this
working group includes timelines," the report noted.]{.underline}
