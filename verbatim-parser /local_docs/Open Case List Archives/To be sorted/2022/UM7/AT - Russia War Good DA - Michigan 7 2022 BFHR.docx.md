The reason for the spikes is due to plants absorbing CO2 during the
spring and summer and then during the winter, the CO2 levels increase,
thus creating a sawtooth pattern. What the graph shows is that the
plants and algae that \'eat\' CO2 cannot keep up with the amount of CO2
produced by humankind through burning of 1 cubic mile of oil per year,
on top of the clear cutting of huge areas of forest. The oceans also
contain an important oxygen generator for the planet, and that form of

Correct me if I am wrong but, This would mean that, at this rate, in 200
years we will have no more oceans, and in less than that, the ocean
would be depleted of all existent life as we know it. So to put it
lightly no more algae, no more oxygen, no more life.
[[Cyanobacteria]{.mark} is the building block of life on this

bacteria which means life could exist. [Without it, life does not

Here is the truth, dispersant and all the techniques we have will never
get rid of the true pollutants. This means that we may make them idle
but it will not save our race. The serious impact of this is that this
is an event that we do not have the technological knowledge to handle as

The answer, **[experts said, is not a very effective one.]{.underline}**

[The [US]{.mark} only]{.underline} [[has a limited ability]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [destroy]{.mark}]{.underline} [an incoming nuclear
[i]{.mark}nter[c]{.mark}ontinental [b]{.mark}allistic
[m]{.mark}issile]{.underline}, a [study ](https://www.aps.org/policy/reports/popa-reports/upload/MissileDefense-Report-final.pdf)released
last month by the **[American Physical Society concluded]{.underline}**.
It said that "the [current capabilities **are low**]{.underline} [[and
will]{.mark} likely **[continue to be low]{.mark}** [for the next **15
years**]{.mark}]{.underline}" to protect the US against a strike from
North Korea, which has an estimated 20 nuclear warheads and relatively
unsophisticated missiles. The Pentagon disputes the findings and says
the most recent tests show the system can handle a North Korean attack.

But [[the ability to defend]{.mark} against an attack by
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[which is estimated to have **nearly
6,000 nuclear warheads**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[and highly
sophisticated missile technology]{.underline}**, [**[is]{.mark}
practically [nonexistent]{.mark}.** The US system is **no match**
against a large number of incoming missiles]{.underline} --- precisely
the kind of attack that Russia would launch, experts said.

"[This idea of an impenetrable shield against an enormous arsenal of
Russian missiles is just a fantasy]{.underline}," said Laura Grego, a
fellow at MIT's Laboratory for Nuclear Security and Policy who
co-chaired the American Physical Society team that wrote the report.
"**[It's too hard to do."]{.underline}**

It's so difficult that the US intentionally hasn't even tried. Official
Pentagon policy states that its system is only designed to protect the
nation from nuclear missiles fired by a rogue state like North Korea.
For a military superpower like Russia[, the US depends on its own vast
nuclear arsenal]{.underline} [of about 5,400 warheads as a
deterrent]{.underline}. It's a doctrine known to those who grew up
during the Cold War as mutual assured destruction or MAD --- any nuclear
attack on the US would result in a counterstrike that would annihilate
both countries.

"The United States relies on nuclear deterrence to address the large and
more sophisticated Russian and Chinese intercontinental ballistic
missile capabilities," according to the Defense Department's most
recent [Missile Defense
Review](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Jan/17/2002080666/-1/-1/1/2019-MISSILE-DEFENSE-REVIEW.PDF).

That's probably surprising, and frightening, to many people, experts
said.

"[It's fundamentally uncomfortable]{.underline}, this idea that we let
the other guy have the ability to take us out and we expect the other
guy to let us have the ability to do that, and we're both going to stay
rational and neither of us is going to cause the other to act on it,"
said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington, D.C., think
tank.

Analysts have raised concerns that [Putin has not been acting
rational](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/03/01/nation/i-personally-think-hes-unhinged-analysts-question-putins-mental-state-after-ukraine-invasion/) in
his attack on Ukraine and in statements like the one he made when
launching the invasion.

"[Anyone who tries to interfere with us]{.underline}, or even more so,
to create threats for our country and our people, **[must know [that
Russia's response will be immediate]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and will
lead you to such consequences as you have never before experienced in
your history,]{.underline}" he said in a televised speech. A few days
later, he announced [Russia's nuclear forces had been placed in "special
combat
readiness."](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/27/us/politics/putin-nuclear-alert-biden-deescalation.html) The
US downplayed the move and gave no indication it changed its own nuclear
readiness level, known by another frightening Cold War-era acronym
called DEFCON.

Panda said many [[Americans]{.mark} **[don't realize]{.mark}** the [US
has **little protection**]{.mark} [against]{.mark} a nuclear
[attack]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"I've seen it on my Twitter mentions," he said. "I've been critical of
setting up a no-fly zone partially on the basis of escalation risks and
people reply, 'Well, let the Russians try to nuke us. We have a missile
shield, we'll be fine.' It's just a very pervasive misunderstanding."

The US must depend on nuclear deterrence because the arithmetic of our
limited missile defense system and Russia's massive arsenal doesn't add
up, said Robert Soofer, who served as deputy assistant secretary of
defense for nuclear and missile defense policy during the Trump
administration. Russia can overwhelm the US system by launching many
more nuclear missiles than it could possibly knock out with its small
squadron of ground-based interceptors.

"There are ways that Russia can strike the United States that really
makes the GBI system virtually useless," said Soofer, a nonresident
senior associate with the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a Washington, D.C., think tank. "If Russia wants to penetrate
US missile defenses, they can."

[The main missile defense system]{.underline} protecting the United
States was developed after [President George W. Bush pulled the nation
out of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/13/international/bush-pulls-out-of-abm-treaty-putin-calls-move-a-mistake.html) it
had signed with the Soviet Union. The move came shortly after the 9/11
terrorist attacks amid heightened concern about a nuclear attack from a
rogue state like North Korea and freed the US from restrictions on
deploying a national missile defense system.

In a rushed effort completed by 2004, the Ground-based Midcourse Defense
system began with 30 interceptor missiles in underground silos: 26 at
Fort Greely in Alaska and four more at Vandenberg Air Force Base in
California. Guided by radar and satellite sensors, they're designed to
pursue an enemy missile into space. There, they release a "kill vehicle"
to intercept and destroy the nuclear warhead above the atmosphere after
it separates from the incoming missile.

The Obama administration added 14 more interceptor missiles at Fort
Greely in 2017. Two years later the Trump administration started the
process of adding 20 more missiles there with upgraded technology and
the first are scheduled to be deployed by 2028.

The US has been testing elements of the system over the Pacific Ocean
since 1999 with mixed results. Of the 19 attempts to destroy the target,
11 have been successful, including the two most recent ones in 2017 and
2019 that were conducted against realistic intercontinental ballistic
missile targets, according to the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency.

"The Ground-based Midcourse Defense system is vitally important to the
defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a
capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat," Air Force
Lieutenant General Samuel A. Greaves, then the agency's director, said
in a [statement](https://www.mda.mil/news/19news0003.html) after the
test.

That threat is rising. North Korea in recent days has conducted two
tests of a new intercontinental ballistic missile, the White House said
Thursday.

But [Russian [nuclear missiles are **more sophisticated**]{.mark} than
those from North Korea]{.underline}, Soofer said. So the US would need
to fire multiple interceptors at an incoming Russian missile to destroy
its warheads, and the system could quickly get overwhelmed.

"At some point, we're not going to be able to handle the Russian
threat," he said. "If there's an unauthorized launch, an accidental
launch, and it's one or two missiles, I hope we can do something against
it. But that's not the way the Russians are going to operate. They're
not going to just launch one nuclear missile against the United States."

To supplement the ground-based interceptors, the US has other ballistic
missile defense systems designed to protect smaller areas. One is the
Aegis system, which can fire missiles from Navy ships or land-based
launchers to target short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. Two
others are the Patriot and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or
THAAD, mobile ground-based systems.

"If the Russians were to launch a modest attack against regional
targets, we have some capacity for intercepting and defeating those
attacks," said Loren Thompson, a longtime defense analyst at the
Lexington Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank. "We have some
reasonable prospects of intercepting nuclear attacks using shorter range
missiles, but [[when it comes to **long-range missiles**]{.mark} with
which Russia could attack America, **[we have virtually no
defense."]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Engineers have been grappling with this question for decades. Yet
curiously, and [[despite]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[monumental]{.mark}
[advances]{.mark} in physics]{.underline}**, **[computing and
A.I]{.underline}**. in the past four decades, [the]{.underline}
[engineering problem of [missile]{.mark}
[interception]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[has yet to be
solved]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

\"There\'s no law of physics against the prospect of intercepting them,
but the [laws of physics make]{.underline} **[it extremely
challenging]{.underline}** --- and create all of these constraints on
how difficult it is to intercept it,\" James Wells, a professor of
physics at the University of Michigan, told Salon.

But Wells noted that such a thing is certainly physically possible.
\"There\'s no theorem that says \'one cannot accomplish missile
defense,\'\" he added. 

Technically, [the U.S. does have a defense ICBM missile
system]{.underline}. [It\'s called the]{.underline} Ground-based
Midcourse Defense ([GMD]{.underline}), and it\'s the only system
currently deployed to defend the continental U.S., with 44 interceptors
based in Alaska and California. Unfortunately, it probably doesn\'t
work.

A [[recent study sponsored by the American Physical
Society]{.underline}](https://www.aip.org/fyi/2022/physicists-argue-us-icbm-defenses-are-unreliable) [concluded]{.underline}
the the **[GMD cannot be relied on]{.underline}** to counter even a
limited nuclear strike. The study specifically focused on ICBMs from
North Korea, and determined the [U.S. defense systems]{.underline} in
place [are unlikely to be reliable enough]{.underline} to guarantee the
mission would be a success **[within the next 15 years]{.underline}**.

Experts tell Salon that despite technological advances, as Wells noted,
there are a few reasons why this is such a hard problem to solve,
scientifically speaking. The primary reason is that [[it is]{.mark}
simply extremely [hard to intercept]{.mark} [something]{.mark} [so
**small**]{.mark} **(about a meter long)** that]{.underline} **[is
[moving so fast]{.mark} (15,000 miles per hour)]{.underline}** **[[in
such a short span of time]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Not to mention that
part of **[[these warheads\' trajectory occurs in
space.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

\"It\'s a really very challenging task,\" Dr. Laura Grego, a Stanton
Nuclear Security Fellow at MIT\'s Laboratory for Nuclear Security and
Policy, told Salon. \"One reason it\'s so hard is that the timescales of
a nuclear armed ICBM attack are very short from launch until they land
--- [it\'s going to be 30 or 40 minutes]{.underline} --- [your defense
has to be ready and effective on those timescales.\"]{.underline}
Likewise, as Grego noted, \"[because the stakes are so high, **it really
needs to work almost perfectly the first time.\"**]{.underline}

Indeed, an ICBM\'s trajectory has three different phases: boost phase,
midcourse phase, and terminal phase, all of which typically occur in
less than an hour from launch to strike. Grego explained that engineers
have long targeted the midcourse phase, when the ICBM is coasting after
launch towards its destination, as an optimal time to intercept. 

Grego said that ICBMs are, by design, hard to intercept. The warheads,
of which there are multiples and which emerge from the cone of the
missile, are \"relative small,\" which makes it hard to attack.
[[Some]{.underline}]{.mark} of these [**[warheads might be
decoys]{.mark}**, [and contain nothing]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Likewise, [the journey of the ICBM takes it through the vacuum of
space]{.underline} --- where, as Grego says, \"[[you]{.underline}
**[don\'t have air resistance]{.underline}**]{.mark} or very little air
resistance, [so a light decoy isn\'t slowed]{.underline} [down compared
to a heavy warhead]{.underline}.\"

**[[This makes it difficult to decipher]{.mark} which one is the actual
warhead, and [which]{.mark} one or [ones are
fake]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Grego explained this is known as the
\"discrimination problem.\"

[The U.S]{.underline}. has [spent]{.underline} **[nearly two
decades]{.underline}** [dedicated]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
[counterterrorism]{.underline} operations where it enjoyed significant
qualitative and quantitative advantages over adversaries. In these

armed
forces.[\[I\]](https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2019/06/26/the-russian-edge-in-electronic-warfare/#_edn1) [However]{.underline},
as [the]{.underline} [U.S. turns toward near-peer
competition]{.underline}, the days of permissive deployments are quickly
coming to an end. Instead, US forces must now fight their way through a
degraded information environment on a daily basis, facing a diminished
ability to synchronize and execute operations. [[Most concerning **are
the growing capabilities of**]{.mark} **[adversaries]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} the realm of]{.underline} electronic warfare
([[EW]{.underline}]{.mark}). Remarkably, [it is Russia that]{.underline}
[presents]{.underline} [some of the stiffest competition]{.underline},
with increasing agreement among experts in the field that Russia has
taken a huge, and somewhat unexpected, leap forward in its EW
capabilities.[\[II\]](https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2019/06/26/the-russian-edge-in-electronic-warfare/#_edn2) [Although

**[[advantage]{.underline}]{.mark}** that seeks to bridge this

an age of renewed competition with Russia, the U.S. will need to
increase its proficiency in EW missions or risk falling behind.

Electronic Warfare and the Growing Russian Threat

Electronic Warfare Basics

[EW]{.underline} [has become a common buzzword]{.underline} in the
defense community, though it is not always well understood. Its purpose
is to deny an adversary from gaining control of, and an advantage in,
the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, while still ensuring friendly and
unimpeded access for oneself and one's
allies.[\[IV\]](https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2019/06/26/the-russian-edge-in-electronic-warfare/#_edn4) [It
is employed to **support military operations**]{.underline} in three
ways: [electronic attack, electronic protection, and electronic
support]{.underline}. [[Jamming]{.underline} **[is a key
tool]{.underline}**]{.mark} in electronic attack, and one that is
commonly referenced in EW literature. The goal is to emit "noise" in an
over-powered signal strong enough to overload the adversary's receivers.
[The result is a jamming of the signal]{.underline} [that the receiving
system is trying to detect, **[interrupting]{.mark} [communications
altogether]{.mark}**]{.underline}.[\[V\]](https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2019/06/26/the-russian-edge-in-electronic-warfare/#_edn5) Electronic
protection involves guarding one's own systems from these very attacks
by hardening electronic sensors and by conducting electronic emission
control so it is more difficult for an adversary to locate a target.
Finally, electronic support are actions that search for, intercept,
identify, and locate sources of EM emissions for the purpose of enabling
the previous two functions. This can also be thought of as the
reconnaissance element of EW. Countries like Russia and the U.S. are
concerned about EW because key objectives like gaining air superiority
greatly depend on achieving EW supremacy. Without it, an adversary can
disrupt and degrade the navigation systems on precision guided munitions
(PGMs) and **[cause missiles to go off course,]{.underline}** **[as well
as suppress a country's air defense systems through
jamming]{.underline}**.

Russian Electronic Warfare: A Learning Curve

Although Russia's **[EW capabilities are a daunting challenge to the
U.S. today]{.underline}**, this was not always the case. During the 2008
Russo-Georgian War, Russian EW capabilities were
limited.[\[VI\]](https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2019/06/26/the-russian-edge-in-electronic-warfare/#_edn6) While
Russia's ground forces made gains against the Georgian army, its air
force was unable to suppress Georgia's air defense systems through
jamming efforts, resulting in the loss of numerous Russian
aircraft.[\[VII\]](https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2019/06/26/the-russian-edge-in-electronic-warfare/#_edn7) Learning
from this experience, Russia has since prioritized investing in EW
tools, with Russian President Vladimir Putin ordering at least 70% of
all Russian EW equipment modernized by
2020.[\[VIII\]](https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2019/06/26/the-russian-edge-in-electronic-warfare/#_edn8) According
to Deputy Defense Minister Yuri Borisov, that figure is now closer to 80
or 90
percent.[\[IX\]](https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2019/06/26/the-russian-edge-in-electronic-warfare/#_edn9) In
2009, Russia also formed units entirely dedicated to EW
operations.[\[X\]](https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2019/06/26/the-russian-edge-in-electronic-warfare/#_edn10) Still,
the overall number of soldiers serving in EW units is relatively low, as
they must undergo specialist training to become proficient in all EW
tools. With contract servicemen making up roughly 55% of these units
today, Russia has a goal of making all units staffed with only
professional servicemen in the near
future.[\[XI\]](https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2019/06/26/the-russian-edge-in-electronic-warfare/#_edn11)

Russian EW Weapons

While there are numerous systems dedicated to EW at the disposal of the
Russian Armed Forces, several stick out from the rest. [The first is the
Borisoglebsk-2,]{.underline} [a system designed to jam]{.underline}
[mobile satellite communications]{.underline} [and radio-navigational
units]{.underline}.[\[XII\]](https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2019/06/26/the-russian-edge-in-electronic-warfare/#_edn12) The
Borisoglebsk-2 is most notable for the role it played in eastern
Ukraine, allegedly impeding the use of Ukrainian drones by suppressing
incoming GPS
signals.[\[XIII\]](https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2019/06/26/the-russian-edge-in-electronic-warfare/#_edn13) [Another
system]{.underline} commonly used by Russia [is the
Moskva-1]{.underline}, the nerve center for Russia's air defenses and
other electronic countermeasure
systems.[\[XIV\]](https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2019/06/26/the-russian-edge-in-electronic-warfare/#_edn14) [This
system monitors electronic emissions]{.underline} within a 400 km range
in real time on all frequency ranges, [carrying out electronic
intelligence-gathering]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[conducting
jamming and electronic suppression]{.underline}** whenever needed.
Russia's Krasukha-2 EW system also possesses the ability to analyze
signal types and then jam adversary's
radar.[\[XV\]](https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2019/06/26/the-russian-edge-in-electronic-warfare/#_edn15) However,
a unique feature is its capacity to provide a false target once the
system has been jammed, leading the aircraft to fly away from its
original target, protecting Russian forces from attack.

Finally[, a notable tool in Russia's EW kit]{.underline}
[similar]{.underline} to the Krasukha-2 is Russia's **[[ability to spoof
signals]{.underline}]{.mark}**.[\[XVI\]](https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2019/06/26/the-russian-edge-in-electronic-warfare/#_edn16) **[Spoofing
is when an actor mimics, or "spoofs,"]{.underline}** legitimate Global
Navigation Satellite System ([GNSS]{.underline}) [signals in order to
manipulate positioning]{.underline}, navigation, and timing (PNT)
data.[\[XVII\]](https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2019/06/26/the-russian-edge-in-electronic-warfare/#_edn17) In
general, [an actor conducts spoofing]{.underline} [by relaying false
positioning]{.underline} [information to an adversary]{.underline}.
Russia deliberately transmits the same signals on frequencies used by
GNSS in an effort to prevent receivers from locking-on to the authentic
GNSS signals. Once Russia's own signal is locked-on instead of the real
GNSS signal, it begins to feed the receiver false PNT information.
**[This [is critical to U.S. operations]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[since
spoofing can affect naval navigation, as well as PGM
routing.]{.underline}**

**Nuclear subs cannot be found**

The Whole Shebang

[[The Severodvinsk]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[is incredibly
advanced]{.underline}]{.mark}** and leverages some technologies that the
Soviet Union researched in the 1980s. It has a large spherical sonar
array in the bow that is thought to be very sensitive.

Because of the sonar's large size, the torpedo tubes were moved from the
nose to a position amidships near the submarine's sail and are aimed at
a forward angle. The Severodvinsk's torpedo tubes are a mix of standard
533 millimeter and 650-millimeter heavyweight torpedos.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}
Severodvinsk's [**[[hull](https://news.usni.org/2014/10/28/u-s-navy-impressed-new-russian-attack-boat) is
made of non]{.mark}** or low-**[magnetic steel]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[which]{.underline}]{.mark} either significantly reduces or
**[[eliminates]{.underline}]{.mark}** the Severodvinsk's [[magnetic
signature.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Soviet (and now Russian) submarines have favored a double hull design in
the past in which a hydrodynamic outer hull encapsulates a stronger
inner pressure hull. The Severodvinsk uses a hybrid design, the outer
hull only partially covers the inner hull.

There is a high degree of automation in
the [Severodvinsk](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russian-submarine-more-match-us-navy-123081),
and the sub's crew complement is consequently small---just sixty-five
sailors and officers.

[[In addition to missiles]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the Severodvinsk
has]{.underline}]{.mark} [[twenty-four tubes]{.underline}]{.mark} aft of
the sail that can carry the P-800 Onyx anti-ship missiles or
[[nuclear-capable]{.underline}]{.mark} Granat missiles.

The Severodvinsk will be armed
with [Zircon](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/us-military-would-lose-russian-hypersonic-missiles-89711) hypersonic
anti-ship missiles, a first in submarine armament.

Silent as a Mouse

In an interview with [60
Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhAaFXyy9rU), a U.S. Navy
Admiral said that Russia has a "very capable submarine force," and that
increased Russian submarine activity gives him pause.

Talking about the Severodvinsk specifically, the
Admiral [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhAaFXyy9rU) that the
Severodvinsk is "a brand new class of submarine, and it's very capable,
and it's very quiet, so that's the most important thing I think, in
submarine warfare."

Although he would not comment on reports that the U.S. Navy lost the
Severodvinsk, Pentagon
officials [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhAaFXyy9rU) that the
Severodvinsk went into the Atlantic Ocean in 2018---and managed to evade
detection for weeks.

the NATO supreme allied commander, replied when asked during a recent
Senate hearing whether the U.S. military has "sufficient visibility" of
the location of Russian submarines in the Atlantic Ocean.

["I don\'t want whatever the missing percent is to be off]{.underline}
[the coast of Maine or New York]{.underline}," Sen. Angus King, a Maine
independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said during the House Armed
Services Committee hearing.

[Wolters]{.underline}, [who also leads]{.underline} [the U.S. military's

that [Russian **submarine** activity has]{.underline} **[spiked even
since last year]{.underline}**, continuing a trend of Moscow's efforts
to project military power in the Atlantic Ocean. His reports dovetail
with the U.S.
Navy's [decision](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/battle-of-the-budget-begins-with-trump) to [revive](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/trump-misses-the-real-nato-success-story) the

Pentagon [assessments](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/no-safe-harbors-china-plots-to-block-us-military-from-key-ports-pentagon-warns) that
China and [[Russia]{.mark} have]{.underline} [[developed]{.mark}
[plans]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [threaten U.S. forces **even in home
ports**]{.mark} along the east coast.]{.underline}

"We took note of the Russian undersea activity in the summer/fall of
2018 and compared it to what Russia executed in the summer of \'19, fall
of '19," Wolters also testified. "And what we saw was a 50% increase in
the number of resources in the undersea that Russia committed to both
those out-of-area submarine patrol operations."

Russian naval forces deployed 10 submarines into the north Atlantic in
October, according to reports, including eight nuclear-powered vessels.

"The aim of the massive operation is to get as far out to the North
Atlantic as possible without being discovered by NATO," the Barents
Observer [reported](https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/security/2019/10/russian-northern-fleet-massive-submarine-show?fbclid=IwAR3GeJq1gfpND026DsGJ8D0JvXrDPhH6BDWULF-X1k4oBeDfEt5cCEA2SNo) at
the time, citing Norwegian intelligence officials.

Those operations, along with the development of new weapons systems such
as "quadcopters," have contributed to the U.S. military's belief that
American **[[forces shouldn't get too comfortable, even at
home.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

"Our new reality is that when our sailors toss lines over and set sail,
they can expect to be operating in a contested space once they leave
Norfolk," Vice Adm. Andrew \"Woody\"
Lewis [said](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/the-homeland-is-not-a-sanctuary-admiral-warns-russia-and-china-can-target-us-navy-in-american-ports) earlier
this month. "We are seeing an ever-increasing number of Russian
submarines deploy in the Atlantic. And these submarines are more capable
than ever, deploying for longer periods of time with more lethal weapons
systems."

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[conducted]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[testing]{.underline} [on its army]{.underline}]{.mark} in the hope of
**[[creating biologically enhanced soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
according to the top intelligence official in the US.

John Ratcliffe, who has served as Donald Trump's director of national
intelligence since May,[ made the claims in a newspaper
editorial](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/03/china-beijing-america-democracy-freedom),
where he warned that [[China]{.underline}
"**[poses]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[the]{.mark} [greatest
threat]{.mark}]{.underline}** to America today".

Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Ratcliffe said: "The intelligence is
clear: Beijing intends to dominate the US and the rest of the planet
economically, militarily and technologically. Many of China's major
public initiatives and prominent companies offer only a layer of
camouflage to the activities of the Chinese Communist Party."

Ratcliffe said China had gone to extraordinary lengths to achieve its
goal.

"[[US intel]{.mark}ligence [shows]{.mark} that
[China]{.mark}]{.underline} [has even **[conducted human

[capabilities]{.mark},]{.underline}" Ratcliffe wrote. "[There are no
ethical boundaries to Beijing's pursuit of power]{.underline}."

Ratcliffe, who previously spent five years as a congressman representing
Texas, said he had "shifted resources" in the intelligence budget to
focus on China.

Many analysts and officials within the government's intelligence agency
have been focused on Russia and counter-terrorism efforts, Ratcliffe
said: "But today we must look with clear eyes at the facts in front of
us, which make plain that China should be America's primary national
security focus going forward."

Ratcliffe's spell as director of national intelligence is due to end in
about six weeks, when Joe Biden is sworn in as president. Biden
has [nominated Avril

[An]{.underline} artificial intelligence ([[AI]{.mark})
[institute]{.mark}]{.underline} [in]{.underline} [Hefei]{.underline}, in
China's Anhui province, says it [has **[developed]{.mark}
[software]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[that can gauge the loyalty of
Communist Party]{.underline}** members -- something that, if true, would
be considered a breakthrough, but has sparked public outcry.

[Analysts]{.underline} [said]{.underline} [China]{.underline} has
[improved its AI-powered surveillance]{.underline}, [**[using big
data]{.mark}**, machine learning]{.underline}, [**[facial
recognition]{.mark}** and AI **[to "get into the brains and minds of its
people]{.mark}**]{.underline}," building what many call a draconian
digital dictatorship.

Smart thought education?

[The institute]{.underline} [posted a video]{.underline} called "The
Smart Political Education Bar," on July 1 **[[to]{.mark} [boast]{.mark}
about its "[mind-reading]{.mark}" [software]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
which it said would be used on party members to "further solidify their
determination to be grateful to the party, listen to the party and
follow the party."

In the video, a subject was seen scrolling through online material that
promotes party policy at a kiosk, where the institute said its AI
software was monitoring his reaction to see how attentive he was to the
party's thought education.

The post, however, was taken down shortly after sparking a public outcry
among Chinese netizens.

Hung Ching-fu, a professor of political science at National Cheng Kung
University in Tainan, in southern Taiwan, said that the Communist Party
has abused technological advances to serve its own political interests.

"It has used cutting-edge technology to empower its party state. China
has upgraded from early-day facial recognition to AI programs that try
to get into brains and minds (more) than meet the eye[. [Its]{.mark}
[adoption]{.mark} [of advanced AI **will**]{.mark} **[reinforce its
total controls]{.mark}**]{.underline}," Hung told VOA over the phone.

Hung added China's AI-fueled police state will weigh on its people, who
are likely to self-censor or live in fear.

Digital repression

But he cast little confidence in what he called China's digital
repression, which he said will likely put the Communist Party in the
"dictator's dilemma" -- a political term that describes a government
leader's failure to win the hearts and minds of its people.

"The taller you build your wall \[of power\], the further you're cut off
from the people... This constitutes what we call the 'dictator's
dilemma' in politics. That is, despite their enormous powers, dictators
keep out of touch with the people. I don't think any political systems
that are against human nature will sustain," Hung added.

VOA's calls and emails to the Hefei-based institute for comment went
unanswered.

[The so-called mind-reading software]{.underline} [is]{.underline} but
the [latest digital control]{.underline} [China has
implemented.]{.underline}

China reportedly has long deployed facial recognition in Xinjiang to
keep tabs on ethnic Uyghurs while having enhanced its surveillance in
recent years with "one person, one file" software to make it easier to
track its people.

Late last year, authorities in Henan province reportedly launched a
similar system to track what they see as "suspicious" journalists,
foreign students and women. At the same time, prosecutors in Shanghai
reportedly adopted AI prosecutors, who can file indictments on eight
criminal offenses, including credit card fraud and charges of picking a
quarrel and provoking trouble.

Chinese online newspaper The Paper reported that a Communist Party
school in Sichuan had developed "Smart Red Cloud" as early as 2017,
which was already able to monitor party member reaction to its political
education and "calculate" their loyalty.

Victims of China's surveillance system

Several rights lawyers and activists told VOA on the condition of
anonymity that they fell victim to China's digital surveillance system.

A rights activist from Wuhan, Hebei, said he was once taken away by
police who were able to identify him after a roadside camera captured
his face while he was on the street.

A Beijing-based rights lawyer complained that he was unable to post
online messages or make an online registration as a result of China's
tight censorship and digital tracking system.

Another rights lawyer revealed that China's police have been illegally
collecting biometric data from the pupils of people's eyes, fingerprints
and urine samples of those in its custody to enhance what he called a
"precise but evil" surveillance.

China's widespread application of AI technologies, however, is
stimulating the sector's innovation, according to the findings of recent
research by author Martin Beraja, an assistant professor of economics at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and three other scholars at
Harvard University and The London School of Economics and Political
Science.

Their research concluded, while new technology bolsters autocratic power
and autocratic demand stimulates innovation, "this mutuality of
advantage may even generate long-term, sustained AI innovation in China,
creating what they call an 'AI-tocracy.'"

**[AI-tocracy]{.underline}**

"In the process of procuring that government contract, they \[AI firms
in China\] get access to this data that allows them, of course, to
innovate for the government application that has to do typically with
public security or preventing crime, or the like. This has spilled over
to their commercial innovation, because, potentially, they may use
either the same government data or, if that's restricted, they may use
the same algorithms that were trained with that data to develop
commercial products that are used in the private sector," Beraja told
VOA.

One such commercial software, for example, is used in supermarkets to
track consumers as they move along the aisles, the professor added.

Beraja, however, expressed concerned over China's AI exports, which he
found in his research are likely aiding other repressive governments.

"One thing that we do observe is that the countries that are more
autocratic or relatively weak democracies are indeed importing more
facial recognition AI from China, more likely facial recognition AI from
China than other technologies. And to me that says that there is a sense
in which these technologies indeed are used for surveillance and
repression," Beraja added.

Zola, a prominent blogger from China who is now a citizen of Taiwan,
said that most netizens in China oppose the country's digital
suppression although their opposition is often muted.

He questioned the sustainability of China's AI-tocracy.

"[China may be exporting these tech]{.underline}nologies [to other
countries]{.underline}. But in the long run, [such a governance
model]{.underline} [will lead a society to go to
extremes]{.underline}...[repeating the irrational policymaking
pattern]{.underline} during the (China's) Cultural Revolution period.
[That will lead to its own collapse]{.underline}," Zola told VOA.

As we are all well aware, the original Cold War, which officially ended
30 years ago last month, featured a number of close calls that almost
turned it into a hot war. Thankfully, neither the Cuban Missile Crisis
of 1962 nor the Able Archer exercise of 1983 (nor any other perilous
incidents), led to a war between Washington and Moscow. More recently,
however, [respected statesmen have again **begun to sound
alarms**]{.underline}. "[Not since]{.underline} [the]{.underline}

**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**estruction---[that keeps the U.S. and Russia

of [the answer lies in]{.underline} the [[**bilateral and multilateral**
agreements]{.underline}]{.mark} specifically [designed to [prevent
**incidents**]{.mark} that could **escalate**]{.underline} into a war.

As is clear from the list below, [there are **[at least half a

prevention of incidents on the high seas [that are **similar** to the
1972 agreement between Moscow and Washington]{.underline}, while Canada
and Greece also have agreements with Russia on prevention of dangerous
military activities. However, almost a dozen NATO members have no such
agreements with Russia, even though they abut seas. These countries
include Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and
Slovenia. Nor are there any multilateral NATO-Russia (or NATO-Collective
Security Treaty Organization) agreements on prevention of dangerous
military incidents, though a NATO-Russia Memorandum of Understanding on
avoiding and managing such incidents has been discussed in Track II.

"5 reasons why the threat of a global war involving Russia is
overstated," *Russia Direct*, 19 Feb,
http://www.russia-direct.org/opinion/5-reasons-why-threat-great-power-war-involving-russia-overstated\]

First, [whatever the rhetoric, major [powers]{.mark} are **not [inclined
towards risky behavior]{.mark}** when their **core interests** are at
stake. This concerns not only the nuclear superpowers, but also
countries such as Turkey]{.underline}. The prospect of confronting
Russia\'s overwhelmingly superior military should give pause even to
someone as hot-tempered as Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. Even if
Erdogan wanted to pit Russia against NATO, it wouldn't work. So far,
[NATO has been careful **to not be drawn into** highly provocative
actions, whether it is by responding to Russia seizing the
Pristina]{.underline} International [Airport]{.underline} in June 1999,
[getting involved on Georgia's side]{.underline} during the military
conflict [in]{.underline} August [2008 or by providing lethal military
assistance and support for Ukraine]{.underline}. Unless Russia is the
clear and proven aggressor, NATO is unlikely to support Turkey and begin
World War III. Second, [[Russia]{.mark} [remains a **defensive
power**]{.mark} aware of its responsibility [for **maintaining**]{.mark}
international **[stability]{.mark}**. Moscow wants to **work with**
major powers]{.underline}, not against them. Its insistence on Western
recognition of Russia's interests must not be construed as a drive to
destroy the foundations of the international order, such as sovereignty,
multilateralism, and arms control. Third, the United States has
important interests to prevent regional conflicts from escalating or
becoming trans-regional. Although its relative military capabilities are
not where they were ten years ago, [the U.S. military and [diplomatic
resources]{.mark} are [sufficient to **restrain**]{.mark} key regional
[players]{.mark} in any part of the world]{.underline}. Given the power
rivalry across several regions, [proxy wars are possible
and]{.underline} indeed [are happening, but they are **unlikely to
escalate**]{.underline}. Fourth, unlike the Cold War era, [the
contemporary world has no rigid alliance structure]{.underline}. The
so-called Russia-China-Iran axis is hardly more than a figment of the
imagination by American neoconservatives and some Russia
conspiracy-minded thinkers. [The world remains a space in which

Hypersonic missiles travel at least five times the speed of sound. Only
a few other manmade devices are capable of reaching hypersonic speeds,
including ballistic missiles, space launch vehicles and unmanned
spacecraft such as the Boeing X-37. The only manned aircraft to achieve
hypersonic speed is the rocket-powered North American X-15, which broke
speed and altitude records when it was introduced in the 1960s.
[Recently, the [focus of]{.mark} research in [hypersonic
tech]{.mark}nologies has [shifted toward missile]{.mark} development,
[but **several challenges** must be overcome]{.mark} to make hypersonic
missiles a reality]{.underline}. First, [[it is difficult to]{.mark}
create a weapon that can reach hypersonic speeds while [endur]{.mark}ing
the **[stress and extreme temp]{.mark}erature[s]{.mark}** [of hypersonic
flight. It is harder]{.mark} still [to ensure]{.mark} that [the weapon
can maintain]{.mark} those [speeds **for** an extended period]{.mark}
--- **enough time** to reach its target]{.underline}. Second, [[high
velocities]{.mark} can [make]{.mark} a hypersonic [vehicle **sensitive
to changes in flight conditions, resulting in instability**]{.mark} in
the missile\'s airframe during flight. Coupled with the fact that high
speeds leave **less time to course correct,** this [instability]{.mark}
can [make]{.mark} [**guidance** of hypersonic missiles
**problematic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Finally, [hypersonic vehicles\'
actual [flight paths **often do not**]{.mark} **[match]{.mark}** the
[predictions]{.mark} researchers derive from ground tests and
theoretical models]{.underline}, lengthening the process of development.
Despite these obstacles, hypersonic missiles have some considerable
advantages. Their speed enables them to reach their targets much more
quickly than other missiles and to better penetrate enemy defense
systems. Those with gliding capabilities can also cover great distances,
enabling one country to strike at another from farther away. Guided
hypersonic missiles would be more accurate than traditional ballistic
missiles, and they could conceivably be armed with nuclear warheads,
becoming a strike asset or a deterrent in nuclear warfare.

[**[Should we be afraid of a]{.mark}**rtificial
**[i]{.mark}**ntelligence?]{.underline} For me, [this is a simple
question with an even simpler, two letter answer:]{.underline}
**[[no]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But not everyone agrees -- many people,
including the late physicist Stephen Hawking, have raised concerns that
the rise of powerful AI systems could spell the end for humanity.
Clearly, your view on whether AI will take over the world will depend on
whether you think it can develop intelligent behaviour surpassing that
of humans -- something referred to as "[super
intelligence]{.underline}". So let's take a look at how likely this is,
and why there is much concern about the future of AI. [**[Humans tend to
be afraid of what they don't understand]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Fear is
often blamed for racism, homophobia and other sources of discrimination.
So it's [no wonder [it also applies to new
tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline} -- they are often surrounded with a
certain mystery. Some [technological [achievements seem]{.mark} almost
[unrealistic]{.mark}, clearly [surpassing expectations]{.mark} and in
some cases human performance.]{.underline} No ghost in the machine But
let us demystify the most popular AI techniques, known collectively as
"machine learning". These allow a machine to learn a task without being
programmed with explicit instructions. This may sound spooky but the
truth is it is all down to some rather mundane statistics. The machine,
which is a program, or rather an algorithm, is designed with the ability
to discover relationships within provided data. There are many different
methods that allow us to achieve this. For example[,]{.underline} we can
present to the machine images of handwritten letters (a-z), one by one,
and ask it to tell us which letter we show each time in sequence. We
have already provided the possible answers -- it can only be one of
(a-z). The machine at the beginning says a letter at random and we
correct it, by providing the right answer. We have also programmed the
machine to reconfigure itself so that next time, if presented with the
same letter, it is more likely to give us the correct answer for the
next one. As a consequence, the machine over time improves its
performance and "learns" to recognise the alphabet. In essence, we have
programmed the machine to exploit common relationships in the data in
order to achieve the specific task. For instance, all versions of "a"
look structurally similar, but different to "b", and the algorithm can
exploit this. Interestingly, after the training phase, the machine can
apply the obtained knowledge on new letter samples, for example written
by a person whose handwriting the machine has never seen before. Humans,
however, are good at reading. Perhaps a more interesting example is
Google Deepmind's artificial Go player, which has surpassed every human
player in their performance of the game. It clearly learns in a way
different to humans -- playing a number of games with itself that no
human could play in their lifetime. It has been specifically instructed
to win and told that the actions it takes determine whether it wins or
not. It has also been told the rules of the [game.]{.underline} By
playing the game again and again it can discover in each situation what
is the best action -- inventing moves that no human has played before.
Toddlers versus robots Now does that make the AI Go player smarter than
a human? Certainly not. AI is very specialised to particular type of
tasks and it doesn't display the versatility that humans do. Humans
develop an understanding of the world over years that no AI has achieved
or seem likely to achieve anytime soon. [The fact that AI is dubbed
"intelligent" is ultimately down to the fact that it can learn. But
[even when it comes to learning, it is no match for humans]{.mark}. In
fact, toddlers can learn by just watching somebody solving a problem
once]{.underline}. An AI, on the other hand, needs tonnes of data and
loads of tries to succeed on very specific problems, and it is difficult
to generalise its knowledge on tasks very different to those trained
upon. So while humans develop breathtaking intelligence rapidly in the
first few years of life, the key concepts behind machine learning are
not so different from what they were one or two decades ago. [**The
[success of modern AI is less due to]{.mark} a [breakthrough]{.mark}**
in new techniques **[and more]{.mark} due [to the vast amount of
data]{.mark}** and computational power **[available]{.mark}**.
I]{.underline}mportantly, though, [[even an infinite amount of data
won't give AI human-like intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark} [-- **[we
need to make a significant progress on developing]{.mark} artificial
"[general intelligence]{.mark}" [techniques
first]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some approaches to doing this involve
building a computer model of the human brain -- which we're not even
close to achieving. Ultimately, [just because an AI can learn,
[it]{.mark}]{.underline} [[doesn't]{.mark} really [follow that it will
suddenly learn all aspects of human intelligence]{.mark}]{.underline}
and outsmart us. There is no simple definition of what human
intelligence even is and we certainly have little idea how exactly
intelligence emerges in the brain. But even if we could work it out and
then create an AI that could learn to become more intelligent, that
doesn't necessarily mean that it would be more successful.

**Too many [tech barriers]{.underline}**

In the 1950s, [the [founders of the field of artificial intelligence
assumed]{.mark} that the discovery of [a few fundamental insights would
make machines smarter than people]{.mark}]{.underline} within a few
decades[. [By the 1980s, however, they discovered fundamental
limitat]{.mark}ions that show that there will always be diminishing
returns to additional processing power and data]{.underline}.
[[Although]{.mark} these [technical hurdles pose no barrier to the
creation of human-level AI, they will likely **forestall** the]{.mark}
**sudden [emergence of an unstoppable "superintelligence]{.mark}**." The
risks of self-improving intelligent machines are grossly exaggerated and
ought not serve as a distraction from the existential risks we already
face]{.underline}, especially given that the limited AI technology we
already have is poised to make threats like those posed by nuclear
weapons even more pressing than they currently are. Disturbingly, little
or no technical progress beyond that demonstrated by self-driving cars
is necessary for artificial intelligence to have potentially
devastating, cascading economic, strategic, and political effects. While
policymakers ought not lose sleep over the technically implausible
menace of "superintelligence," they have every reason to be worried
about emerging AI applications such as the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency's submarine-hunting drones, which threaten to upend
longstanding geostrategic assumptions in the near future. Unfortunately,
Superintelligence offers little insight into how to confront these
pressing challenges.

**\*\*quotes added for clarity**

Currently, the United States is struggling to adjust to new
technological developments as it enters an era of near-peer competition.
But [it is critical for U.S. policymakers to take the long view of
technological change. Recalling the frequent shifts in the historical
relationship between offense and defense, it becomes evident that **[the
standard cycle of]{.mark} offensive and defensive weapons [development
will continue and]{.mark} that defensive [solutions to the hypersonic
challenge will]{.mark} soon [be developed]{.mark}.** When that happens,
**[Chinese and]{.mark} [Russian acquisition of hypersonic]{.mark}
weapons [will]{.mark} actually help to [stabilize
relations]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [not unlike [a conventional form of
m]{.mark}utually [a]{.mark}ssured [d]{.mark}estruction. **[Such a
development would mark]{.mark} a [departure from a period when the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [had precision]{.mark} [capabilities and
others did not, which amplified Russian fear]{.mark} of the United
States.** Historical perspective helps to temper the fear of
destabilizing innovations in the hypersonic weapons space by U.S.
rivals]{.underline}. [During the interwar period, airpower advocates
from Giulio Douhet to Billy Mitchell insisted that the bomber could not
be stopped. The devastation that bombers could bring to cities would be
so horrific that war simply could not last more than a few days.
Airpower, they insisted, should be used as part of a "relentless"
offensive. The development of radar before the outbreak of World War II,
however, **helped reset the balance** between offense and
defense.]{.underline} As legendary airman Claire Chennault insisted even
before radar was developed, the bomber would not be "the first exception
to the ancient principle that for every weapon there is a new and
effective counter weapon." [We can point to numerous other examples of
this rebalancing between new offensive and defensive capabilities, such
as between armor and anti-tank missiles]{.underline}. More recently,
anxiety about the destabilizing effects of drones has receded to some
extent with the development of anti-drone technology. Today, experts
worry about airpower's limitations in light of drastic improvements in
defensive capabilities, especially advanced surface-to-air missiles.
Hypersonic weapons, however, offer the possibility of resetting that
balance just as improvements in bombers did prior to the advent of
radar. A recent War on the Rocks article described how hypersonic
missiles, "which travel at speeds greater than Mach 5, shorten John
Boyd's famous observe-orient-decide-act loop, making it nearly
impossible for human minds and teams to even comprehend the information,
let alone defend against a short-range attack." The article paints a
compelling picture of the kind of threat the United States faces as its
peer competitors diligently pursue weapons that pose a seemingly
intractable problem. Hypersonic weapons have many in the U.S. military
on edge. Due to their speed, they significantly reduce reaction time,
have sufficient kinetic power to cause significant destruction even
without a payload, and are difficult to intercept. As a result,
hypersonics can bypass a country's defense systems and strike areas
within that country with little to no resistance. [The U.S. Defense
Intelligence Agency told Congress in its Worldwide Threat Assessment
that hypersonics will "revolutionize" warfare by enabling targets to be
struck faster, harder, and from farther away. Note, however, that such
characteristics are far more evolutionary in nature than revolutionary.
**[It is important to acknowledge]{.mark} the [limitations]{.mark} [of
hypersonics]{.mark}, which do, in fact, permit the development of
defensive countermeasures**]{.underline}. [While hypersonic weapons
travel at an extremely fast rate of approximately 2 miles per second,
the speed of the Tsirkon hypersonic cruise missile, **[they]{.mark}
still [pale in]{.mark} [comparison to]{.mark} the speed of
[d]{.mark}irected [e]{.mark}nergy [w]{.mark}eapons** (which travel at
the speed of light, 186,282 miles per second]{.underline}). **[Directed
energy [weapons]{.mark} such as lasers and high-power microwaves [are
gaining traction]{.mark} because they address the threat of hypersonics
with an unconventional approach]{.underline}**. Throughout history,
militaries have tried to defeat weapons by creating the next most
advanced version of those weapons. If one country created a missile
capable of traveling 10 miles, another country would create a missile
capable of traveling 20. However, [with directed energy weapons, the
approach is to defeat the technology that makes these advanced weapons
so threatening. Lasers are capable of destroying targets using a focused
beam of energy, while high-power microwaves are an invisible wave of
electromagnetic energy capable of frying microprocessors. Hypersonic
weapons are fast, **but they are not instantaneous**]{.underline}. Thus,
[[when used against moving targets]{.mark} beyond certain distances, the
[weapons lose effectiveness]{.mark} as the target's speed increases and
its size decreases.]{.underline} [Such [limitations require]{.mark} most
hypersonic weapons to have some form of [onboard guidance, which]{.mark}
in turn [necessitates]{.mark} electronic [circuits]{.mark} to do
computations and make guidance adjustments]{.underline}.
[**[These]{.mark} circuits [are highly susceptible to]{.mark} high-power
[microwave damage]{.mark}.** Additionally, the beam width of high-power
microwaves is significantly wider than that of a weaponized laser, which
requires less time to be used for targetin]{.underline}g. Although
lasers are extremely effective, when it comes to countering hypersonic
weapons, they are limited by line of sight, limited range, and power
requirements. For this reason, when talking about defending against
hypersonic weapons, high-power microwaves are the more logical choice.
Additionally, [because [hypersonic]{.mark} weapons are so fast, they
[struggle with maneuvers]{.mark} in the final seconds against small
fast-moving targets. This is [due to]{.mark} maneuverability
[limitations at high speeds. Hypersonic weapons]{.mark}, therefore, [are
most effective for large and slow-moving]{.mark} or stationary
[targets]{.mark}, such as an aircraft carrier.]{.underline} [[Areas
outfitted with]{.mark} high-power [microwaves could provide]{.mark} area
[denial capabilities]{.mark} for high-value target areas against
hypersonic weapons]{.underline}. Using the equations provided in a
University of Maryland study of high-power microwave technology, a
source power of 9.5 megawatts could deliver the power density required
to damage a hypersonic weapon at a target 25 miles away. This would be
about 12.5 seconds prior to the missile reaching the transmission site,
assuming the hypersonic weapon is traveling directly toward it. This may
not seem like a long time, but the slightest change in trajectory in
anything traveling at those speeds would result in a drastically
different termination point. For example, an angular change of half a
degree would result in a miss distance of 1,150 feet. [Additionally,
depending on the fusing method, high-power microwaves may also be able
to prevent the weapon from fusing and, ultimately, deny
detonation.]{.underline} China is one of many countries attempting to
develop such directed-energy technology. Richard Fisher, an expert on
Chinese and Asian security at the International Assessment and Strategy
Center, stated in testimony before the U.S.-China Economic and Security
Review Commission: \["\]Some Chinese military experts expect that energy
weapons will become more prevalent in 10 to 20 years and will dominate
the battlefield in 30 years. As such, it is imperative that the United
States redouble its focus to achieve technology breakthroughs needed to
realize decisive energy weapon capabilities and be ready to cooperate
with critical allies to accelerate co-developments. The U.S. should also
retain the flexibility to deploy energy weapons from diverse platforms,
including space platforms, to meet what could be rapidly emerging new
Chinese energy weapon threats.\["\] Lockheed Martin is now also
discussing integrating the technology into UAVs for the Army, but this
integration is at a tactical level while high-power microwave technology
has strategic uses. Although Boeing initially led the high-power
microwave field in 2012 with its development of the Counter-electronics
High-powered Advanced Missile Project, or CHAMP, its use and integration
has been limited to the B-52. Other countries are advancing the field.
China is developing high-power microwaves not only for the purpose of
deployable munitions but also for area denial for high-value targets.
More integration is necessary if the United States is to remain
effective in an evolving battlespace. High-power microwave technology,
however, is not without its own weaknesses. Its effective range is based
on the power density present at the target, a number of factors that can
affect this figure, such as transmitter power, feeder loss, antenna
gain, range, path loss, and the effective isotropic radiated power.
These factors really boil down to two design elements: environment and
range. These limitations can be used to create a versatile weapon that
can defeat hypersonic weapons in most cases. As technology moves
forward, someone will inevitably determine how to artificially increase
the path loss to a point where the microwave drastically loses
effectiveness. It is important to acknowledge each technological leap
not as a permanent solution but as part of an ongoing cycle, just as has
been the case for other weapons, such as the tanks discussed earlier.
Many in the Army believed them to be obsolete in the 1970s until
innovators stumbled upon a lightweight protective material that provided
them with an important offensive advantage once again. [Whether it is
hypersonic weapons or high-power microwave technology, no one method or
technology can exist for long without a countermeasure.]{.underline}
Still, [hypersonics and other weapons will continue to entice nations
with the promise of easy answers that can reduce the fog and friction of
war. For now, U.S, policymakers should invest in directed-energy
technology while bearing in mind that it is not a silver bullet. Amid
the return to great power conflict, it is understandable that the United
States fears the rapidly increasing capabilities of its rising peer
competitors. **But it is worthwhile to consider whether the U.S.
investment in hypersonics needs to be rebalanced more toward developing
defensive capabilities**. It is also helpful to consider those fears in
historical perspective and in light of constant shifts in the
technological and military balance. The United States needs offensive
and defensive hypersonic capabilities for deterrence. Yet [ironically,
China and Russia's acquisition of]{.mark} these [capabilities
can]{.mark} help to [stabilize tensions because it helps them fear the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [less]{.mark}, and vice versa. [So keep
calm and innovate on.]{.mark}]{.underline}
