Would it be credible? [[Some claim]{.mark} that a France]{.underline}
and/or UK-based [**[nuc]{.mark}lear [deterrent]{.mark}** would [not
have]{.mark} the necessary **[credibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}.53 But
[it is **[widely considered]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [[a
**small**]{.mark}**er [arsenal]{.mark}** []{.mark}can [deter]{.mark} a
[**major power** provided]{.mark} it [has]{.mark} the [ability to
**inflict damage** seen as **unacceptable**]{.mark} by the other
party]{.underline}. This has always been the premise of
"[deterrence]{.underline} of the strong by the weak"---and is [not
connected with the size of the other party's nuclear
arsenal]{.underline} as long as deterrence does not rely on a
"counterforce" strategy, or on the ability to destroy the equivalent
territory or population of the defender. [It is]{.underline} also [**not
connected** with the size of the other party's **conventional military
capabilities** as long as one does not rely on]{.underline} any
[war-fighting or nuclear defense]{.underline} strategy---concepts
[that]{.underline} even [NATO no longer applies]{.underline}. Most
importantly, again, [[deterrence exercised by]{.mark} a [European
power]{.mark} might be]{.underline} seen as [**[more credible]{.mark}**
[than when]{.mark} it is [exercised by]{.mark} a **[distant
protector]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [the idea is that]{.underline} "[[be

The [[E]{.underline}]{.mark}uropean [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nion has
[already [undertaken]{.mark} various **concrete [steps]{.mark}**
[towards]{.mark} **[strategic autonomy]{.mark}** by creating entities
that will work toward **achieving** this **objective**]{.underline}.

First, [the **[C]{.mark}**apability **[D]{.mark}**evelopment
**[P]{.mark}**lan]{.underline} (CDP), [[where]{.mark} [Member]{.mark}
State[s]{.mark} **[identify]{.mark} [priorities]{.mark}** in their
**national defence planning** [and **streamline**]{.mark} the
[objectives]{.mark} into a set that all can agree on]{.underline} while
maintaining consistency with NATO's objectives (EEAS, 2020). The overall
[aim of the CDP is to [enhance]{.mark} **[cooperation]{.mark}** and
**coherence** in Member States' plans and to define common]{.underline}
European [priorities in **capability development**]{.underline}
(European Defence Agency, 2020a). To streamline European countries'
objectives in this field, the CDP informs the other instruments
described below: the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), the
Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the European Defence Fund
(EDF) (EEAS, 2020). As presented above, [developing [common]{.mark}
[objectives]{.mark} **[enhances]{.mark}** the Member [States']{.mark}
[capacity to]{.mark} [act]{.mark} **[autonomously]{.mark}** and as **one
entity**]{.underline}.

**[[CARD]{.underline}]{.mark}** is another of the EU's major defence
achievements. This mechanism was [created to **[centralise
analysis]{.mark}** on the implementation of defence plans at the
national level]{.underline}. The [**[E]{.mark}**uropean
**[D]{.mark}**efence **[A]{.mark}**gency]{.underline} (EDA)
[[gathers]{.mark} [all]{.mark} the latest and the most detailed
**[info]{.mark}**]{.underline}rmation [Member States can provide on the
**results** [of]{.mark} their **implementation** of the **[CDP]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} [launch]{.mark} the **[CARD process]{.mark}**]{.underline},
which is composed of four steps. First, the EDA analyses all relevant
data it has gathered and all material provided -- voluntarily -- by the
Member States. Second, the EDA engages in a bilateral dialogue with each
individual participating Member State to validate and potentially
consolidate the information. Third, the EDA produces a "CARD Analysis"
which "presents aggregate data and \[identifies\] trends regarding
defence spending plans, implementation of priorities", and cooperation
opportunities. Finally, a definitive CARD report drafted by the EDA
presents the main findings and recommendations (EDA, 2020b). Such a
document will allow Member States to streamline their objectives to
identify cooperation opportunities in capability development.

[**[PESCO]{.mark}** is a legally binding framework based on]{.underline}
Article 46 of [the Lisbon Treaty]{.underline}. In Biscop's (2017) words,
[it]{.underline} "[formulate]{.underline}\[[s]{.underline}\] [the
**level** of **ambition** for the strategic autonomy]{.underline} of a
group of European States" who are "capable and willing to do so" (EEAS,
2019a). The [PESCO framework now [consists]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a list of
**[47 projects]{.mark}**]{.underline} to which 25 European states
participate; out of EU Member States, only Denmark and Malta do not
participate. The aim is [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} "[**[jointly]{.mark}
[develop]{.mark}** **[defence capabilities]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
[increase]{.mark} their **[readiness]{.mark}** and **availability** [for
EU military]{.mark} **missions** and **operations**]{.underline}" (EEAS,
2020). PESCO is designed to be led by a core group of states -- in which
France and Germany particularly need to have a prominent role -- who
will take bold and concrete steps to move European defence forward,
working in a "he who loves me follows me" way. The aim is for the core
groups to lead others into harmonising their capability development
plans and to eventually reach a point where all European states act in
the same direction.

Finally, the [**[EDF]{.mark}** will [foster innovation]{.mark} [and
competitiveness]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the European [defence market]{.mark}
[by]{.mark} [providing]{.mark} the [necessary]{.mark} [fund]{.mark}ing
[for]{.mark}]{.underline} Research & Development
(**[[R&D]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[and]{.mark} by [co-financing]{.mark}
approved development [projects]{.mark}]{.underline} with a contribution
of up to 20% (EC, 2019 & EEAS, 2019b). For research, the level of EDF
funding can be up to 100% (EC, 2019). The collaborative aspect of the
R&D strand of the [EDF]{.underline} combined with the co-financing
offered by the capability strand [lessens the **financial burden** that
defence and capability development bears]{.underline} on European
countries. [By **alleviating**]{.underline} some unnecessary and
duplicated [**costs** across]{.underline} the European continent, [the
[EDF]{.mark} [initiative]{.mark} **[contributes]{.mark}
[significantly]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the European journey to [strategic
autonomy]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Through the initiative]{.underline},
[the EU will]{.underline} eventually [be able to build an **autonomous**
and **self-sufficient defence market** by developing its
**capabilities** while **supporting European industries**]{.underline}.
Thanks to the savings made through pooling and sharing capacities,
European actors can also better afford critical technology for which
they still rely on increasingly isolationist non-European powers. By
developing its autonomous defence market, the EU therefore significantly
expands its ability to "act alone when necessary", in the spirit of
strategic autonomy.

time period (World Bank n.d.). As mentioned above, [[Kaliningrad]{.mark}
now found its land borders [surrounded by NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} (it
faces neutral Sweden by sea), [but this [threatened]{.mark} the enlarged
[NATO]{.mark} alliance much [more]{.mark} [than]{.mark} it threatened
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Kaliningrad]{.mark} has long [been
**heavily militarized**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most of its population
since Soviet times has worked in military installations (Chillaud and
Tetart 2007), even though Russian deployments there were cut somewhat in
the 1990s to meet the zonal limits of the original CFE Treaty (Kramer
1997). But in [a future war with Russia, NATO would have a challenge
resupplying and reinforcing the Baltic states]{.underline}, for two
reasons. First, by land [[NATO]{.mark} could [only get to]{.mark} the
[Baltics via]{.mark} the [Suwalki]{.mark} Gap]{.underline}, **[a
40-mile-long [chokepoint]{.mark}]{.underline}** on the Poland/Lithuania
border [[faced by]{.mark} **heavily militarized** [Kaliningrad]{.mark}
on one side [and]{.mark} the nominal **Russian ally [Belarus]{.mark}**
on the other]{.underline} (Roblin 2019). Russia often participates in
joint military exercises with Belarus, some of which have resembled
World War Two scenarios in size, [and [Moscow could]{.mark} easily
**[move]{.mark}** large [**forces** to Belarus
**quickly**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Second, [[Kaliningrad]{.mark} is the
[perfect]{.mark} place for Russia [to implement]{.mark}]{.underline} an
anti-access/area denial ([[A2/AD]{.underline}]{.mark}) [missile defense
strategy, leaving the Baltic states **cut off** from]{.underline} the
rest of [NATO]{.underline} by air and sea [unless NATO were willing to
bear the likelihood of **signifcant casualties**]{.underline} (Williams
2017; Sukhankin 2017, 2018b). An infuential 2016 RAND study concluded
that [[NATO]{.mark} forces would be [incapable of deploying quickly
enough]{.mark} even to defend]{.underline} the Baltic states from a
Russian surprise attack (Boston et al. 2018). In short, NATO expansion
to include the Baltic states weakened NATO, not Russia.

The Illusion of the US Nuclear Umbrella",

Deterrence theory is almost as old as the nuclear age. Consequently, the
idea of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) and the use of nuclear weapons
as a retaliatory deterrent has dominated the field of nuclear weapons
and politics from the 1950s onwards.\[1\] However, like any field, [a
series of **[biases]{.mark} [infect]{.mark} it**]{.underline}. This
blind trust and belief in the postulations of [[Deterrence
Theory]{.underline}]{.mark} has established what Nick Ritchie called the
"[regime of nuclear truth]{.underline}" [and
**denominated**]{.underline} "**[nuclear
absolutism]{.underline}**."\[2\] The effects of this [**unquestionable
belief** in Deterrence Theory sharply increases States' **reliance** on
and **valuing** of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. Consequentially, it
[[poses]{.mark} an [existential]{.mark} [threat]{.mark} [to
**disarmament**]{.mark} processes [and]{.mark} **[severely
undermines]{.mark}** nuclear weapon [States']{.mark} **[Article VI
obligations]{.mark}** [under]{.mark} the]{.underline} Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ([[NPT]{.underline}]{.mark}). It is
long past time these 'truths' were punctured.

Deterrence Theory, derived from a Realist school of thought, postulates
that the possession of nuclear weapons -- the ultimate deterrent -- will
thwart and deter attacks against the possessor. The sheer destructive
power inherent in a single nuclear weapon, let alone thousands
detonating in quick succession, make their use (almost) unthinkable. As
a means to solidifying a unified front against the Soviet Union in the
aftermath of the Second World War, the Western European States along
with the United States formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) in 1949 to deter the Soviet Union's massive conventional forces,
as well as its ever-increasing nuclear arsenal after its first test a
few months later. [[With **NATO**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[became]{.mark} the **[guarantor]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the **defence**
of Western [Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and the]{.underline} so-called
[US **[nuclear umbrella]{.mark}** was **born**]{.underline}.

[As stated in Article V of the NATO treaty]{.underline}, an attack on
one member was an attack on all of them. [The US nuclear
umbrella]{.underline} is, therefore, [a **security assurance agreement**
that the US]{.underline} deterrent intended primarily to defend itself,
also [**extends** over the **territory** of its **NATO
partners**]{.underline}.\[3\] In other words, the [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [would **defend NATO members** against
aggressors]{.underline}, even [resorting to **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}, should the situation require these capabilities
to be deployed. In theory, the US nuclear umbrella would soothe NATO
members' anxieties and serve as an alternative to the acquisition of
their own nuclear weapons.\[4\] However, given its Realist roots, the
crucial question arises: when push comes to shove, [[would]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[be **willing** to]{.mark} **[risk]{.mark}** its **[own
security]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} [defend]{.mark} its allies in
[Europe?]{.mark}]{.underline} [What are the **costs** of **sustaining**
the **illusion** of the US nuclear umbrella?]{.underline} While these
questions retained an academic quality for some time, in the Age of
Trump, they urgently require revisiting.

Alliances under Anarchy: a Realist Take

Realism puts significant emphasis on self-help given the anarchical
setting of the International System. Cooperation is scarce and limited,
and only possible if states see it in their primal interest of survival
and quest for power. Nevertheless, military alliances do happen and are
circumscribed in the theoretical postulations of Realism---they last for
as long as the states involved see it as comparatively advantageous. In
particular, alliances are formed to counter a third, more powerful,
state.\[5\]

The [US nuclear umbrella]{.underline}, one of the crown jewels of NATO,
[**relies heavily** on the existence and **credibility** of military
alliances]{.underline}. If the alliance fails, so do the security
assurances. In that sense, even though military alliances do exist, it
seems almost incredible that, under Deterrence and, therefore, Realist
logic, military alliances would include credible nuclear security
assurances. In other words, following the Realist rationale of self-help
and its ultimate goal of survival, it seems highly unlikely that a state
would risk its own security and survival to come to the defence of
another state, ally or not, that is threatened by a third.

[[Historically]{.underline}]{.mark}, [military alliances based on
[mutual]{.mark} assistance and [defence]{.mark} have [**proven to be
nothing but** **empty promises**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 1924,
Czechoslovakia and France signed the Treaty of Alliance and Friendship,
which stated that the two States would come to the other's aid in times
of peril.\[6\] In 1938, given the rise of tensions just before the
Second World War in Europe, Czechoslovakia also had a gentleman's
agreement with the United Kingdom regarding the latter's aid in case of
a military invasion of the former by Germany.\[7\] However, when Germany
invaded Czechoslovakia, neither agreement was fulfilled, following
several of the bedrock assumptions of the Realist school of thought.

[Alliances]{.underline}, therefore, [are **susceptible** to
**failure**]{.underline}. As hard as it is for military alliances to
succeed, the nuclear age amplifies the obstacles for their endurance.
Even [at the height of the Cold War]{.underline}, inside the war
planning rooms of the Pentagon and the Strategic Air Command, [the
nuclear security assurances seemed to **tremble**]{.underline}. [During
the Berlin Crisis]{.underline} of 1961, top [US officials were
**reconsidering** whether the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[should employ nuc]{.underline}lear weapon[s to defend]{.underline} an
eventual military incursion of the USSR in [West
Germany]{.underline}.\[8\] Since the development of nuclear weapons and
the dominating logic of nuclear deterrence, it is [perfectly reasonable
to argue that [security]{.mark} [assurances]{.mark} in the nuclear age
[are **quasi-empty words**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2020, revisiting the
bases of [the [US]{.mark} nuclear
[umbrella]{.mark}]{.underline}---particularly [[in
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[does]{.mark} [it]{.mark} still [hold
**any value**]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a [credible]{.mark} security
assurance[?]{.mark}]{.underline}

New York for Paris? The US Nuclear Umbrella Revisited

The [strength of the US nuclear umbrella guarantee **raised questions**
from the very start]{.underline}, most notably from France. In the
1960s, General Charles de Gaulle was highly sceptical of US nuclear
security assurances, particularly after the USSR developed
intercontinental ballistic missiles with enough range to reach the
United States. This [scepticism]{.underline} led de Gaulle to [pose the
question whether US]{.underline} President John F. Kennedy [would be
**willing to risk New York for Paris**]{.underline}. Eventually, [this
very lack of confidence]{.underline} [fomented the development
of]{.underline} France's force de frappe---**[the French nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}** -- [allowing France to be able to protect itself
and **avoid**]{.underline} a strict [**dependency** on
**NATO**]{.underline}.\[9\]

The question posed by de Gaulle summarises the central issues with the
credibility of US -- or any -- nuclear security assurances and
umbrellas. In 1970, given the USSR's massive conventional forces and its
nuclear parity with the US, President Richard M. Nixon believed the
nuclear umbrella was no longer sustainable.\[10\] Despite his beliefs,
Nixon could not publicly admit the frailty of the US nuclear umbrella
lest it create anxieties in its European allies and tampers with the
Cold War balance.\[11\]

Fast forward to the present day, Donald Trump was elected President in
2016 with the slogan 'America First.' Ever since tensions have risen in
the nuclear sphere in multiple fronts. President Trump, echoing
President Harry S. Truman's words from 1945, famously threatened "fire
and fury" against North Korea and withdrew from the Iran Nuclear Deal.
Moreover, relations with Russia have also deteriorated after the mutual
withdrawal from the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty and the seemingly
unwillingness to extend New START---the only treaty remaining treaty
limiting US and Russia's nuclear arsenals---despite Russian President
Putin's positive signalling towards extension. Similarly, President
Trump has repeatedly shown his contempt for NATO, after moving to cut US
contributions to the organisation. Despite Trump's increased reliance on
nuclear weapons and desire of a larger arsenal, it seems unlikely Trump
and his 'America First' mentality would risk New York -- or any other US
city, for that matter---for Paris. [The [**illusion** of]{.mark} the
[US]{.mark} nuclear [umbrella]{.mark} seems to be **[surfacing]{.mark}**
at last]{.underline}. On the other side of the Atlantic, a recent poll
conducted by the Körber Foundation showed that [the [German
population]{.mark} **would [rather]{.mark}** either [rely]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} **[France]{.mark}** and the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[K]{.underline}**ingdom [for nuclear assurances or even **forgo them**
than to rely on the US nuclear umbrella]{.underline}. Notwithstanding,
high-ranking military officers seem to hold on to the current regime of
nuclear truth.

Sustaining the illusion of the US nuclear umbrella incurs other costs
whose effects have a global reach. By perpetuating the current regime of
nuclear truth, the US is selling its nuclear umbrella, using it as a
rock-solid alibi to keep the United States from abiding by its
disarmament commitments. Under Article VI of the NPT, each State
"\[...\] undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective
measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date
and to nuclear disarmament".\[12\] One key-argument against US nuclear
disarmament for decades has been the anxieties it would create amongst
its allies under the US nuclear umbrella.

The nuclear non-proliferation regime is already strained as it is. Arms
control seems to be failing and non-nuclear weapons States are
frustrated with the slow pace of disarmament efforts. The so-called
'grand bargain' of the NPT -- non-proliferation in exchange for nuclear
technology for peaceful purposes and the promise of disarmament -- is in
jeopardy. [The **maintenance** and [**belief** in]{.mark} the
[US]{.mark} nuclear [umbrella]{.mark}]{.underline} and the growing
frustration from the non-nuclear weapon States with its nuclear peers
[[coalesce]{.mark} in [existential threats]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the
**[cornerstone treaty]{.mark}** [keeping]{.mark} nuclear
[prolif]{.mark}eration **[at bay]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Were the
illusion of the umbrella finally exposed, it would eliminate a key
hindrance to nuclear disarmament. [The [US]{.mark} nuclear
[umbrella]{.mark} seems to have **[lost its
credibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}. President Trump, in practicing his
'America First' policy has opened the blinds showing the illusion of its
nuclear security assurances, particularly in the post-Cold War world.
[The [dismantlement of]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} nuclear
[umbrella]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [being replaced by a European nuclear
umbrella]{.underline}, led by France and the United Kingdom, or
eliminated completely -- [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} likely
[[have]{.mark} **[no]{.mark} de facto [changes]{.mark} [in European
security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Rather, it would cripple to
anti-disarmament movement in the United States. [The
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [is
**[unlikely to risk New York for Paris]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[and]{.mark} its [Europe]{.mark}an allies seem to **[already know
it]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Waking up from this illusion would create a
more inviting environment for nuclear disarmament.

THE shameful events in [[Afghanistan]{.underline}]{.mark} in recent
weeks have [led to a [**dramatic loss** of **credibility** for]{.mark}
the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[and **NATO**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the minds of the Western public.
The earlier [**criticism** of the Atlantic Alliance]{.underline}'s
policies and actions [has now **increased enormously** and]{.underline}
has [become the **most widespread meme**]{.underline} in the
publications of various media.

The mournful announcement of the British Daily Mail is more
straightforward than ever. Next to the image of a coffin covered in the
national flag, is posed a question Britain has never been able to
answer: what, in the end, did they all die for in Afghanistan?

The British TV channel Sky rightly points out that after the withdrawal
of Soviet troops in 1989, the official government of Afghanistan endured
for three years, and after the US withdrawal it did not last even three
hours.

[The [seizure]{.mark} [of power]{.mark}]{.underline} in Afghanistan [by
the Taliban]{.underline} (banned in Russia) [is a]{.underline} grave
disgrace and a **[[shameful defeat for NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
believes the Swiss TV channel SRF. [One of the [Alliance's **grandest
projects**]{.mark} of the past two decades has been [brought]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n **ignominious [grave]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Western countries have failed to build democracy in Afghanistan, and now
they refuse to even address the future of the country and its people.

NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg is not cut out for big speeches;
indeed, even when he has something positive to say, he gives, to put it
mildly, 'an excessively reserved impression', writes a diplomatic
correspondent of the Swiss TV channel SRF. When Stoltenberg was finally
confronted about the failure of the Western military alliance in
Afghanistan, he looked deeply broken and depressed.

As the Wall Street Journal points out, [Biden's]{.underline}
'disgraceful [departure']{.underline} [from Afghanistan was a **slap in
the face** for NATO]{.underline}. Following the 9/11 attacks, when the
Collective Defence Clause was invoked for the first time in history in
Afghanistan, America's allies in the Alliance have shed much blood in
that country, spent vast sums of money in the conflict, and lost more
than a thousand people. The newspaper stresses that [Washington almost
**mocked** its partners]{.underline} when [in his speech about the
withdrawal of troops Biden only **briefly mentioned NATO** and did not
say a **word** about]{.underline} the [European allies]{.underline} of
the United States. So [it is **[not surprising]{.mark}** that
[Europe]{.mark}an leaders are [**seething** with
**anger**]{.mark}]{.underline}, concludes The Wall Street Journal.

In his time, [French president]{.underline} Emmanuel
**[Macron]{.underline}** was met with a barrage of criticism when he
[spoke of NATO as]{.underline} '**[brain dead']{.underline}** in 2019.
But it was then that [he warned that **no matter who was in charge** of
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, it was [becoming an
**increasingly less dependable ally**]{.underline}. And
[[today]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Macron's words]{.mark} seem]{.underline}
nothing short of [[**prophetic** throughout]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Europe]{.mark}an capitals]{.underline}.

For Europe, the Taliban's seizure of power in Afghanistan is an
unmitigated nightmare, writes Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten. First of
all, because [the US]{.underline} has [shown through its **hasty
withdrawal** that it **no longer intends** to **defend**
the]{.underline} '**[free world]{.underline}**', and without American
support Europe does not have enough strength to defend itself, and this
catastrophic deficit is unlikely to be eliminated soon.

Moreover, there has been talk in the European Union for many years about
the need for a European army, which, however, has come to nothing so
far. The Lisbon Treaty provides for a tight tie between the European
Union and NATO, headed by the United States, but given the changed
circumstances, this point needs to be reconsidered, the Germans argue.
[The notion that Americans would be willing to engage in worldwide
warfare in the name of protecting democracy has become an
**illusion**]{.underline}. The Truman Doctrine, adopted in 1947,
stipulated that Washington would support free nations in their struggle
against totalitarian regimes, but under former President Donald Trump
and his successor, Joe Biden, the United States has abandoned these
values, the German newspaper notes.

In an August 17 interview with the online publication Parlamentní listy,
Czech President Milos Zeman said that [the [US]{.mark} has [**fallen**
from]{.mark} the **[prestige]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} a **[world
leader]{.mark}**]{.underline} after the withdrawal from Afghanistan,
[and [concerns]{.mark} have been [raised]{.mark} [about]{.mark} the
[**meaning** of **NATO's existence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Czech
president noted that [the **[distrust]{.mark}** of NATO on the part of
the member countries [will only **grow**]{.mark}]{.underline} after the
recent incidents in Afghanistan. At that, he stressed: 'But if NATO has
been a failure, then that should lead to a reassessment of our military
spending and an emphasis on national defence.'

Criticising the NATO evacuation in Afghanistan, the German tabloid Bild
paid special attention to the fact that during the organisation of the
withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, the Bundeswehr focused on
removing 29 pallets of beer and a popular German beer-lemonade mix, as
well as 340 bottles of wine, champagne and other alcohol that remained
in stock at its base in Mazar-i-Sharif. Additional transportation
capacity was provided for this, which was not previously available for
the local German helpers who risked their lives to make Afghanistan a
better place. Thus, 65,000 cans of beer turned out to be more valuable
to the German government and defence minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer
than the people who risked their lives to make Afghanistan better, the
German media emphasise. [European leaders]{.underline} are [wondering
how]{.underline} the current [failure in Afghanistan will affect
NATO]{.underline}. However, according to The Washington Post observer,
they should [also reflect on the fact that the **[existence]{.mark}**
[of the alliance]{.mark} is [**threatened** by]{.mark} the
**[hostile]{.mark} public [opinion]{.mark}** in their own
countries]{.underline}. The core principle of the alliance is the rule
that all countries must come to the aid of a member of it in the event
it is attacked. [[If one refuses]{.mark} [to participate]{.mark} [in
collective defence]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the entire [alliance]{.mark}
will **[cease to]{.mark} [be]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And the [withdrawal
of US troops from Afghanistan raises the question of
whether]{.underline} or not [that country can **live up** to its
**commitments**]{.underline}. However, [[recent]{.mark} public opinion
[polls show]{.mark} that [those polled]{.mark}]{.underline} are **[[no
longer willing to support]{.mark} the [US]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
either a conflict with Russia or in a conflict with China...

Twenty years ago, hardly anyone could have imagined that by ending the
war in Afghanistan, Washington would almost call the Taliban its ally.
Today, these fighters ensure the evacuation of Kabul, the Americans
provide them with reports with all the data on their citizens and
Afghans, who 'can be allowed to enter the airport.' These passenger
lists have already been dubbed the execution lists.

'Since July, the US has evacuated more than 100,000 people from
Afghanistan. Were all of them Americans? Were all of them heroes? No!
Only 5,000 of them are US citizens. Were each and everyone of the
remaining 95,000 all interpreters? No! Today, the State Department
admitted that they have no idea how many of these people have a special
visa proving that they worked for the US. The pilots are not given
passenger lists. We are told that refugees pass the border without being
searched. It appears that we don't even know who they are taking back
here', says Fox News host Carlson Tucker.

On the whole, [the [public opinion]{.mark}]{.underline}, amid recent
events in Afghanistan, [[is]{.mark} that the US and [NATO]{.mark} have
once again [displayed]{.mark}]{.underline} to the world [their
[**inadequacy** in]{.mark} [achieving]{.mark} their designated
[goals]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [this]{.underline}, in turn, [[raises
**justifiable doubts**]{.mark} as [to]{.mark} [their]{.mark}
**[ability]{.mark}** [to fulfil]{.mark} their declared **[international
obligations]{.mark}** [regarding]{.mark} the [security]{.mark} of their
allies]{.underline} and partners.

Even so, [[NATO's]{.mark} present [problems]{.mark}]{.underline} predate
Trump and are largely [the [result of **long-term structural
forces**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the absence of a common, clear, and
present danger, sustaining an elaborate multinational alliance was
always going to be difficult, and it is in some ways a testimony to past
diplomatic artistry that NATO has kept going as long as it has and
despite the failures in Afghanistan and Libya and the divisions that
erupted over the war in Iraq. [[Even if]{.underline}]{.mark} Trump had
[stuck with the status quo]{.underline}, [**[reaffirmed]{.mark}** the
**[U.S. commitment]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and played nicely with
Europe's leaders]{.underline}, [it would **[not]{.mark}** have
**[reversed]{.mark}** the **[gradual erosion]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the
trans-Atlantic [partnership]{.mark}]{.underline}.

A [[better]{.mark} [course]{.mark} would have been to [start]{.mark} a
**gradual**, **[constructive]{.mark}**, and]{.underline} if possible
[**amiable [decrease]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the [**U.S. security role**
in **Europe**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [making it **clear** to U.S. allies
that Washington no longer]{.underline} believed it [needed to maintain a
security presence there and that it planned to be]{.underline} either
**[completely]{.underline}** or nearly **[out]{.underline}** in five to
10 years. The United States might conceivably remain a formal member of
NATO, but it would no longer station forces there, no longer insist that
the supreme allied commander in Europe be a U.S. officer, and [no longer
expect the **Europeans** to fall **obediently** into line whenever
**Washington barked orders**]{.underline}. Trade, investment, and
tourism would continue, and U.S. arms manufacturers would be free to
sell to European buyers if these states decided to bolster their
defenses. Meanwhile, the United States would be free to focus on other
problems.

Contrary to what you might think, I'm not anti-European, let alone
anti-NATO. The alliance was a bold achievement for its time and one that
served both the United States and Europe well in the past. But as I
wrote back in 1998:
"\[**[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**\][**[othing]{.mark}** is
**[permanent]{.mark}** in international affairs]{.underline}, and
[NATO's **past achievements** should not blind us to its **growing
fragility**]{.underline}. [Instead of **mindlessly extending
guarantees** to every potential trouble spot]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} instead of [basing our foreign policy on a
**presumption** of **permanent partnership**]{.underline}, [it is [time
for]{.mark} [Europe]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[to
begin]{.underline}]{.mark} a slow and gradual process of
**[[disengagement]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[This is going to happen

[statecraft]{.mark}** anticipates and **[exploits]{.mark}** the **tides

then and is even truer today.

A quick comparison of forces shows that [[Russia]{.mark} has **[clear
military superiority]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}]{.underline} European
[[Arctic]{.mark} waters]{.underline}. Moreover, [[Moscow]{.mark} clearly
[sees]{.mark} the High North [as]{.mark} a strategic as well as an
operational [priority]{.mark}]{.underline}, [having created
a]{.underline} new, [**full-fledged** military district for the
Arctic]{.underline} in late 2019 [and an **electromagnetic warfare**
center]{.underline} for the Northern Fleet last May.

Although lacking modern surface combatants, [the **[Northern
Fleet]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[Russia's key **military presence** in
the Arctic]{.underline}---[has been [adapted]{.mark} with **lighter
surface** vessels equipped with **standoff missile
systems**]{.underline} (P-800 Oniks and Kalibr-NK mostly). Among other
available assets, it can count on one Kirov-class nuclear-powered
guided-missile cruiser, one Slava-class guided-missile cruiser, one
Gorshkov-class frigate, up to four Udaloy-class anti-submarine
destroyers and one recently deployed diesel-electric icebreaker. The
fleet of deployable submarines, although ageing, is still a force of six
to seven ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), four active cruise
missile submarines (SSGNs) and eight to nine nuclear-powered attack
submarines (SSNs), two to four special mission submarines (SSANs) and up
to five conventional attack submarines.

The [Northern Fleet also has **[powerful air
assets]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which create a
**[multi-layered]{.mark}** air- and sea-**[denial network]{.mark}**
giving the armed forces space for **perimeter control** and
**out-of-area interdiction**]{.underline} from long-range to coastal
defense. These systems including several regiments of S-300 and S-400
air defense systems, air superiority fighters (notably several squadrons
of Su-33s and MiG-29s) and missile systems.

With assets mostly concentrated around Arkhangelsk and on the Kola
Peninsula, the Northern Fleet hosts three naval formations, the 45th Air
and Air Defense Army and the 14th Army Corps (including the Arctic
Brigade with the 80th and 200th Separate Motor-Rifle Brigades). The
[Northern Fleet **alone** [can]{.mark} organically **[generate]{.mark}**
up to [six]{.mark} **[b]{.mark}**attalion **[t]{.mark}**actical
**[g]{.mark}**roup**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} (BTGs) [scattered
[around]{.mark} the **[Kola]{.mark}
[Peninsula]{.mark}**]{.underline}---four ground-based and two from naval
infantry.2 Special forces units are generated from the 61st Red Banner
Naval Infantry Brigade. Ground troops are mostly used for the protection
of the coastline of Russia's Arctic zone as well as facilities and
infrastructure located there.

Meanwhile, [[Russia]{.mark}'s armed [forces]{.mark} have recently
**[focused]{.mark}** their training [on]{.mark} amphibious
**[coastal]{.mark} [assault]{.mark}
[capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [**air defense systems** in the
region [and]{.mark} **[combined]{.mark} arms
[operations]{.mark}**]{.underline} between naval and air forces. The
Russian armed forces operate a relatively disparate network of bases and
air strips across the country's Arctic zone, with military
infrastructure there serving both military and civilian purposes,
notably for search and rescue operations, radar coverage and domain and
situational awareness.

In case of regional military tension or a standoff, the Kremlin's
strategy would likely seek to move away from Arctic waters as quickly as
possible toward the North Atlantic. [Moscow's regional strategy
encompasses **[out-of-area sea denial]{.mark}** through
defense]{.underline} in depth in order [to remove any **military
tension** from the **Kola Peninsula**]{.underline},3 [which hosts
two-thirds of Russia's **sea-based nuclear deterrent**]{.underline}.
[This would **[increase pressure]{.mark}** [on NATO]{.mark} [to
defend]{.mark} the [SLOC]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which is paramount for
**freedom of operation**]{.underline} and navigation in the North
Atlantic. [This would also]{.underline} potentially [[hamper]{.mark}
[access]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the [Baltic Sea]{.mark} in terms of
reinforcements]{.underline} as well as create a contested environment
toward the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap in the northern Atlantic
Ocean. [**[Perimeter]{.mark} [defense]{.mark}** is **[ensured]{.mark}**
[by]{.mark} **multi-layered air** **defense** and **coastal defense

**[2NC\-\--NATO Bad\-\--AT: Baltics]{.underline}**

**Deterrence in the Baltics is severely lacking\-\--Russia would
curb-stomp us**

[In the meantime, [a single Russian]{.mark} air assault
[division]{.mark} with its own tank battalion based in Pskov, just 20
miles from the Estonian border, [has]{.mark} probably **[more
professional soldiers than the entire \[EDF]{.mark}**\] Estonian Defence
Forces, which acquired their very first tracked infantry fighting
vehicles in 2019]{.underline}. Not to mention the Kaliningrad Oblast as
the most militarised part of Europe and all the other Russian
installations in Luga, Ostrov, Vladimirsky Lager and elsewhere that
include the most modern attack helicopters, Iskander-M ballistic mis-
siles as well as rocket artillery and that are already present today in
the immediate vicinity of the three Baltic NATO member states (see
Sutyagin and Bronk 2017). [It thus seems that [NATO has a **fundamental
problem**]{.mark} [with deterrence at the conventional level]{.mark}.
[Sufficient capabilities are missing]{.mark} on the Eastern Flank, and
the reinforcement strategy is dubious, to say the least]{.underline}. It
was only in March 2019 that the U.S. Army began to once more exercise
rapid deployments of parts of its Armored Brigade Combat Teams from
Texas to Europe at a very short notice. This was the first time that it
did so since the end of the Cold War (Rising 2019). [There is
**[no]{.mark}** plausible [**reason** to expect that a battalion-size
forward presence plus]{.mark} a possible [reinforcement would form a
**credible deterrent**]{.mark} in the Baltics under these circumstances
if the same strategy in a similar general deterrence situation was not
con- sidered as a viable option for Europe during the latter half of the
Cold War]{.underline}. And this is even more so the case if NATO is in a
more disadvantageous position in the Baltics than it was in West Germany
before the fall of the Berlin Wall. [[The assumption]{.mark} of the
British Ministry of Defence (2017) that the [eFP]{.mark} in Estonia
"[will provide]{.mark} a proportionate, defensive, and [combat capable
force]{.mark} to defend our NATO ally and deter any form of hostile
activity against the Alliance" [is]{.mark} simply
**[unfounded]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[NATO]{.mark} communication related to the security of the Baltics
[seems]{.mark} to be **[in denial]{.mark}** of the mismatch between the
declared need to deter Russia on the one hand and the capabilities
necessary to achieve that on the other]{.underline}. As the former
SACEUR James Stavridis pointed out: "\[w\]hile over the long term Russia
would find itself overmatched by NATO (which outspends Russia on
military activity by approximately 10-to-1), the short-term outcome
could be a NATO capital or two in Russian hands" (Stavridis 2019).
[[Insufficient]{.mark} local [capabilities]{.mark} [prevent]{.mark}
NATO's deterrence **[posture from being credible]{.mark}** enough and
that is so in spite of the overall Western conventional, technological
and material superiority over the Russian military]{.underline}. NATO's
credibility ceases to exist if the Alliance first sets itself a goal at
the level of battalions and then continuously updates and upgrades that
goal eventually ending up establishing a Multinational Division North HQ
in Latvia in 2019. Not to mention the wider context of a gradual
increase of the U.S. presence in Poland, including its setting up of a
forward division HQ there. Every step in this case represents merely a
tacit acknowl- edgement of lacking capabilities in the first place.
[Thus the same future Estonian Defence Minister Jüri Luik, who
originally praised the eFP battle groups as a "sufficient minimum
baseline" in 2016, claimed together with the top Lithuanian security
analyst Tomas Jerma- lavičius already a year later (Luik and
Jermalavičius 2017, p. 237), that the battalion-sized eFP battle groups
"unfortunately do not constitute a force capable of denying Russia its
initial aims, while the deployment of [NATO's rapid reaction]{.mark} and
follow-on forces [is vulnerable to **political and military
suasion**]{.mark}, [including]{.mark} through A2/AD activation and
nuclear [threats]{.mark}]{.underline}". To make the case still more
illustrative, even the tripling of an important reinforcement element --
the NATO Response Force (NRF) -- after the summit in Wales in 2014
results, according to Jens Ringsmose and Sten Rynning (2017a, p. 17),
largely from a "creative book- keeping", in which forces that stand up
and those that stand down are now counted together with those on
standby. "[The **[NRF is not adequate]{.mark}** for deterring attacks on
the Baltic allies" (Ringsmose and Rynning 2017b, p. 451) and the whole
concept of relying on reinforcements, if taken seriously, seems rather
suspicious from the military point of view]{.underline}.

But it is not the missing credibility of the Allied deterrence posture
-- despite the great effort in communicating the opposite -- that stands
out as the most important finding result- ing from NATO's local
conventional inferiority. The Alliance conveys an official story of a
suc- cessful deterrence in line with the second row of Table 1 that
formalises the logic of general deterrence in terms of Boolean logic.
[The problem is that even if NATO might have a global escalation
dominance over Russia, "[Russia has **escalation dominance** over
the]{.mark} [Baltic]{.mark} countries individually and
collectively]{.underline}" (Lanoszka 2016, pp. 191--192). [The lack of
sufficient local capabilities that undermines the credibility of the
overall deterrence posture shall then take us to the third row of Table
1, which predicts that **[deterrence should fail]{.mark}** and a
challenge to the status quo coupled with a threat to use military force
should be made in case of an ample opportunity to advance national
interests]{.underline}. Capability is a required condition of a
deterrence success and "in a game in which at least one player's threat
lacks capability, deter- rence will fail" (Zagare 1987, p. 77). Yet a
demand to change the status quo in the Baltics did not happen in spite
of the lasting local conventional superiority of Russian forces (Kroenig
2015, p. 54) and their ability to swiftly conquer the region.

[Thus, [there exists]{.mark} a [potential for Russia to succeed in the
Baltic]{.mark} region [due to]{.mark} its **[conventional
supremacy]{.mark}** in the region, relatively [radical views of]{.mark}
local [Russian-speaking communities, **lack of the credible
deterrence**]{.mark} elements, etc. Next to the opportunity that it o
ers to Russia, according to the view of the authors, the attack against
the Baltic countries could also be at least as strongly [motivated by
Russia's wish to ridicule the Alliance]{.mark} and the collective defen-
ce/deterrence network as a whole]{.underline}. Looking from this
perspective, there exist many reasons why Russia would select the Baltic
countries for this purpose. [First, this could happen because of the
[logistical advantage for Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Russia has a
land border]{.mark} with this region and the [territories]{.mark} of the
Baltic countries [are]{.mark} also fully "[covered" by Russia's]{.mark}
anti-aircra and [missile defence]{.mark} systems. Second, as
[easy]{.mark} as it would be [for Russia to bring additional military
supplies]{.mark} to the Baltic region, [the more difficult it would
be]{.mark} to do so [for]{.mark} the leading countries of [the
Alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}. ird, the relatively large
Russian-speaking (and ne- cessarily Russian-minded) community could be
easily mobilised to justify and support Russia's aggressive ambitions in
the Baltics.

to do so [exacerbates tensions]{.underline}.**

On the other hand, NATO enlargement exposes the United States to a
variety of security ills while limiting its ability to respond to these
dilemmas. First, ongoing expansion requires the United States to defend
several Eastern European states of questionable strategic value, up to
and including the use of nuclear weapons. Even if some of the members to
which NATO has expanded are useful for denying prospec- tive rivals
maneuvering room to prove their mettle (e.g., the European Union) or
expanding their geographic reach (e.g., Russia), many of the member
states to which the United States oered security guarantees via NATO are
of minimal long-term importance. [[Loss of]{.mark} the **[Baltic]{.mark}
state[s]{.mark}** to Russia]{.underline}, for instance, [would [do
**little**]{.mark} [to]{.mark} **[shift]{.mark} [Europe's]{.mark}
[strategic map]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [while none of NATO's new
Southeastern European mem- bers are of use in either **reinforcing US
power** or **denying power** to others]{.underline} (Shifrin- son 2017a,
111). [Having taken on the commitment]{.underline}, however, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates--- [as [NATO]{.mark}'s
principal military backer]{.underline}---[is now **[stuck]{.mark}**
having to try [to **defend**]{.mark}]{.underline} these actors. [This is
**[no easy task]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially [in the
Baltics]{.underline}; [local **[geography]{.mark}** is
**[unfavorable]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the [**[distances]{.mark}**
involved [make **reinforcement**]{.mark}
**[difficult]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and the [**[proximity]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} local **prospective [threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}---in
this case, Russia---[[means]{.mark} it is nearly [impossible]{.mark} to
obtain **favorable [force ratios]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Nevertheless,
the United States and other NATO members have tried to engage the
problem, committing growing assets along the way (Kuhn 2018; O'Hanlon
and Skaluba 2019; Lanoszka and Hunzeker 2019). [The [alliance]{.mark}
is]{.underline} therefore [[playing]{.mark} a **[fraught
game]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and its partners [can certainly [try to]{.mark}
[develop]{.mark} military [tools]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [meet]{.mark}
NATO's expanded [commitments]{.mark}]{.underline}, [but [doing

[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}---insofar as allies are under the US security

[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [putting its **own [survival]{.mark} on
the line** by extending US nuclear guarantees in the face of a
nuclear-armed opponent]{.underline}.12 In sum, US backing for
enlargement has left the United States with a suppurating sore of a
strategic commitment, putting it on the ring line in Eastern Europe.

**respond**]{.mark} [to]{.mark} **international [crises]{.mark}**
diplomatically and]{.underline}, if necessary,
**[militarily]{.underline}**. [[China's]{.mark} majority
[ownership]{.mark} positions]{.underline} in about 10 percent of all
European port capacity and its investments in civilian roads and rails
in Eastern Europe potentially [**[complicate]{.mark}** [NATO's]{.mark}
**military [mobility]{.mark}** [and **readiness**]{.mark} in a crisis
situation]{.underline}. Similarly, if some allies include Huawei
equipment in their 5G networks, questions about the integrity of their
telecommunications would be raised given the close ties of the company
with the Chinese Communist Party. [Sensitive defense **supply chains**
of allies can also be **overly dependent** on China]{.underline}, as
recently witnessed with the F-35 fighter jets. [China's **military
reach** is also getting closer to the Euro-Atlantic region]{.underline}.
The Russian and Chinese navies have conducted joint military exercises
in the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas, signaling a burgeoning military
cooperation between Beijing and Moscow. Collaboration between China and
Russia grows stronger in the Arctic, where both countries invest in
natural gas projects as well as in transport corridors as part of an
effort known as the "Polar Silk Road" or the "Northern Sea Route."
Beyond the Euro-Atlantic area, [[China]{.mark} is [developing]{.mark}
**[modern military capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} ([long-range
missiles]{.underline}, [aircraft carriers]{.underline}, [and nuclear
attack submarines]{.underline}) [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially
[**serious [security implications]{.mark}** [for NATO]{.mark}
[given]{.mark} their **[global]{.mark} [reach]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Likewise, [[China]{.mark} is [investing]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
**[counterspace]{.mark} [weapons]{.mark}** that could potentially
[threaten]{.mark} any [NATO]{.mark} [sat]{.mark}ellite]{.underline}.
Allies are also regularly the targets of cyberattacks originating from
China-based hackers. [Allies have faced an **increasingly**
**assertive** **Chinese fo**]{.underline}reign **[po]{.underline}**licy
[as well]{.underline}. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, [Beijing has notably
intensified its **disinformation efforts** directly targeting **NATO**
countries]{.underline}. Beijing has also tried to leverage its close
economic ties with some NATO countries through the Belt and Road
Initiative to erode allies' cohesion and unity in an effort to impede
criticism of Beijing's human rights violations and its violations of
Hong Kong's Basic Law. [China actively exploits bilateral ties to impede
unified positions within]{.underline} the [Europe]{.underline}an Union,
[making it a very easy step to diminish joint positions at NATO on
**issues** **contrary** to **Chinese interests**]{.underline}. [This
dimension of the China challenge **underscores** the **importance** of
NATO's **political cohesion** toward Beijing]{.underline}.

**China has [massive]{.underline} advantages.**

[[Chinese]{.mark} actions and [power]{.mark} could **[well
erode]{.mark}** [NATO's capacity]{.mark} [to]{.mark} **exercise
[self]{.mark}-[defense]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [From
**telecommunications** to **industrial control systems**]{.underline},
[from **space** and **cyberspace** to **bridges**]{.underline},
[**railroads** and **ports**]{.underline}, [[China]{.mark} already
[has]{.mark} a **[heavy footprint]{.mark} [presence]{.mark}**
[throughout]{.mark} the [transatlantic]{.mark} community]{.underline}.
[[NATO]{.mark} will [need]{.mark} all this **[infrastructure]{.mark}**
[to **deter** **conflict**]{.mark} and **defend itself**]{.underline}.
[Yet]{.underline} if [[China]{.mark} [controls]{.mark} the
**[off-switch]{.mark}**]{.underline} or [has the capacity to **conduct
malicious** or **denial activities**]{.underline}, [[NATO's]{.mark}
[capacity]{.mark} for self-defense]{.underline} will be **[[severely
compromised]{.underline}]{.mark}**. NATO has other concerns, as well. It
cares a lot about arms control, and not just in a Eurocentric sense of
the U.S., Britain and France v. Moscow. NATO correctly views arms
control as a global issue---and China is a necessary player in global
arms control. The alliance has a vested interest in the future of that
dialogue. What should NATO do? For starters, it need not open its
headquarters to Chinese officials to get their "take" on how to deal
with Russia, the Middle East, etc. There's little sense to give China
yet another international forum for bloviating. What is needed are sober
intra-NATO discussions on how to deal with the boys from Beijing.
[Currently]{.underline}, [[NATO]{.mark} member countries are [**far**
from]{.mark} [being]{.mark} of **[one mind]{.mark}** on the
**matter**]{.underline}.

Furthermore, even before Trump's current term at the White House
expires, [[America]{.mark}'s [policy]{.mark} as to its European and
Asian allies will be **increasingly [shaped]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} **US
[perceptions]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the role [allies]{.mark} play in
[helping]{.mark} or hindering **US objectives [towards]{.mark}
[China]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [ongoing
[dispute]{.mark}]{.underline} between the US and China
[[concerning]{.mark} the acquisition of [5G]{.mark} networks is the
**[first]{.mark} major [test]{.mark}** of this proposition]{.underline}.
[[America]{.mark} has openly [threatened to]{.mark} [curb]{.mark}
**[intel]{.mark}ligence sharing** [with]{.mark}]{.underline} its closest
[[allies]{.mark} [if]{.mark} they choose to [entrust]{.mark}
[China's]{.mark} Huawei [Tech]{.mark}nologies Company]{.underline} [with
setting up their 5G networks]{.underline}.15 It remains to be seen what
practical conclusions the US will actually draw if major allies such as
France, Germany, Italy or the UK decide to 'go Chinese'. If no key
European ally chooses Huawei, following in Japan's and Australia's
footsteps, that outcome will be due at least in part to the strength of
America's campaign calling attention to the security and strategic
implications of their 5G decisions. [Given the **commercial
[advantage]{.mark}** enjoyed [by **Huawei**]{.mark}]{.underline} as a
result of the infrastructure it built up as part of 3G and 4G networks
and what is apparently massive state aid[, it could normally
[expect]{.mark} [to be]{.mark} [selected]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a
[5G]{.mark} prime [contractor]{.mark} in many markets in the absence of
**broader security** and **strategic considerations**]{.underline}.16
[As China's rise **consolidates** and]{.underline} as its
[**assertiveness** increases over time]{.underline}, [[NATO]{.mark} will
be]{.underline} systematically [[**forced** to choose]{.mark}
[between]{.mark} [working]{.mark} **[with]{.mark}** the
[US]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**without** the US [or]{.mark}
**[against]{.mark}** the [US]{.mark} [when it comes to]{.mark}
**relations** with [China]{.mark}]{.underline}. China itself well
understands this. It is handling the precedent-setting 5G confrontation
as a first-order political issue. Threats from Chinese ambassadors in
Europe and others arose from November 2019 onwards, while the general
tone of Chinese diplomacy in Europe and Canada deteriorated, with
punishments imposed on a broad range of issues.17 [Against this
backdrop]{.underline}, [the [relationship]{.mark} between the US and its
NATO allies will be increasingly [prone to]{.mark} **misunderstanding**
and **uncontrolled [disagreements]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is in the
North American and European interest to work together to avoid the
former and reduce the latter to manageable proportions. [Because
[European]{.mark} [and Canadian]{.mark} [interests]{.mark} may
**[align]{.mark} more [closely]{.mark}** [with China]{.mark}'s policies
than with America's on a number of key issues]{.underline} -- such as
the global financial order, the extraterritorial reach of American law
and climate change -- [[any US]{.mark}--[Europe]{.mark}
[mechanism]{.mark} for coping with differences would need [to]{.mark}
have a **[heavily transactional cast]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with or
without Trump. [The basic **[structural differences]{.mark}** between
the **new international system** and its **bipolar** and **unipolar
predecessors** will further [complicate]{.mark} **[transatlantic]{.mark}
[interactions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[These **[concerns are significant]{.mark}** now, and have the potential
to become worse in the future, [as they are]{.mark} the [seeds]{.mark}
out of which might grow a "decoupling" of the alliance]{.underline}. All
else being equal, a tight coupling of NATO's military capabilities and
political intent augments the alliance's deterrent capability and its
political health. The threat from Russia is not the threat from the
Soviet Union, to be sure. [However, the [lopsided nature of]{.mark}
**[the threat from China]{.mark}**---an increasing threat to the United
States and its interests but a far lesser threat to European
states---does **[introduce the potential for
divergence]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Within the alliance, [perceptions vary considerably regarding]{.mark}
the threat **[China]{.mark}** poses. For example, May-Britt Stumbaum, an
expert on the European Union (EU)--China relationship, argues that,
"given their significantly different global outlooks, the
\[[US]{.mark}\] United States [and the \[EU]{.mark}\] European Union
**[differ fundamentally in their perceptions of China's
rise]{.mark}**]{.underline}�"13 [She submits that [Europe]{.mark} does
not and [will]{.mark} probably **[never share the United States' hard
power perspective]{.mark}** on Asia-Pacific]{.underline}. The U.S.'
rebalancing to Asia-Pacific was spurred by strategic military
consideration and is seen in an economic view only secondarily. For the
Europeans, and particularly Germany, the Asia-Pacific region and the
relationship with China is shaped by the "tyranny of distance," with
Russia in between consum- ing most of the strategic thinking and
resources that Germany and Europe entertain eastward.14

[Moreover, some [European analysts]{.mark}, like Chinese ones, **[tout
the importance of multipolarity]{.mark}** in global politics,
[and]{.mark} the [necessity for]{.mark} strategic **[cooperation in the
EU-China relationship]{.mark}**]{.underline}�15 For instance, Gustaaf
Geeraerts asserts that, "as \[a\] consequence of increased international
engagement and increasing economic in- terests abroad, Europe and China
are geopolitically more proximate than ever be- fore."16 [As these
arguments suggest, this introduces the possibility that a wealthier and
more prominent, powerful, and assertive [China will be able to
**entice**]{.mark} some [European states into **passivity**]{.mark}, or
even neutrality, [in the event of a Sino-American crisis]{.mark} or
confrontation]{.underline}.

**NATO's decision-making process is slow for cyber response**

Still, before NATO invokes Article 5, it has other options at its
disposal. NATO has a sophisticated cyber capability---including experts
on cybersecurity, intrusion detection, and computer forensics---that it
could activate following a NAC decision to combat a cyber act of
aggression.237 As this thesis has previously discussed, NATO's Rapid
Reaction Teams (RRTs) can deploy on short notice upon a request to offer
technical assistance to NATO facilities and Allied members that suffer
network intrusions.238 Each day, the NCIRC Center analyzes and responds
to over 200 million cyber incidents that take place on NATO's
networks---ten of which on average are sophisticated attacks requiring
action by the RRT.239 [According to [NATO]{.mark} experts (expressed
during the author's conversations in Brussels, Belgium, September 17,
2015), although the NAC [deploys the RRT]{.mark} [**daily** for its
own]{.mark} network [security, it has **yet to do so on behalf of an
Ally**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Because [a decision to deploy the RRT must
be reached by the NAC]{.mark}, [protocol]{.mark} might **[impede the
team's]{.mark}** future **[efficacy]{.mark}** [in cyber
response]{.mark}, at least in some circumstances. Thus, [NATO's
ability]{.mark} to act quickly on behalf of an Ally attacked in
cyberspace could be **[impeded by its bureaucratic consensus
model]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

**NATO's political willingness to respond to a cyber attack is
low\-\--that wrecks preparedness**\-\--this is presumption level

[Although [NATO's]{.mark} one-nation, one-vote consensus principle
reinforces the idea that each Ally is equal, is this in fact the case in
the eyes of specific Allies]{.underline}? The nations surveyed during
the 2008 and 2015 Pew studies are among the Alliance's top security
contributors. Indeed, many of them also have the largest political
influence within NATO. [Their [reluctance to employ force]{.mark} to
protect fellow Allies could **[corrode the Alliance's
solidarity]{.mark}** and adversely influence future defense
policies]{.underline}. [If the [publics]{.mark} and presidential
frontrunners in major NATO nations **[are unwilling to uphold]{.mark}**
national **[commitments]{.mark}** under the Washington Treaty after an
armed attack on an Ally, what does this waning support imply for their
resolve to do so in reply to a perceived lesser assault in
cyberspace]{.underline}? [[Waning public support]{.mark} for honoring
Article 5 commitments may [signify]{.mark} an even **[lower willingness
to meet NATO's]{.mark}** collective defense [**obligations** in response
to]{.mark} an act of terrorist or state-sponsored [cyber
aggression]{.mark}.]{.underline} Some public opinion polls suggest that
if a cyber threat met the threshold of an armed attack, NATO might be
less prepared politically to invoke Article 5 than in a case of
conventional military aggression. While polling is an important tool in
political decision making, in practice governments take many factors in
addition to public surveys into account in deciding whether and how to
use force. [[Declines in political will]{.mark} and public support for
NATO's collective defense principle in some Allied member states have
[**left NATO minimally prepared** to respond]{.mark} effectively
[to]{.mark} major acts of [cyber aggression]{.mark} against one or more
of its members, particularly when that response necessitates the use of
military force.]{.underline} Out of a numerical ranking of 1--3, the
Alliance earned a preparedness score of 1 in political will.

**[2NC\-\--NATO Bad\-\--AT: Democracy]{.underline}**

**European leadership solves democracy.**

Lizza **Bomassi &** Pierre **Vimont, 19** (Lizza Bomassi, Deputy
director of Carnegie Europe. M.Sc., London School of Economics, Pierre

It is on democracy, unsurprisingly, that the traditional debate on
values is most palpable. [Today, the state of **democracy** and human
rights **globally** is **poor**]{.underline}. Many see a waning
commitment to these values from the traditional bastions of the current
democratic world order. Yet this depiction hides a more nuanced picture.
While executive-level support for democracy promotion in its more
traditional homes has declined, its operational manifestation remains
largely intact. [Governments still channel a considerable
amount]{.underline} of financial assistance [toward the technical level
in this field]{.underline}. And various democracy initiatives, such as
Sweden's Drive for Democracy, illustrate how individual [[EU]{.mark}
member states have [acted]{.mark} [as]{.mark} [**champions** of
**democracy promotion**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This has sent a confusing
message and led to different responses from different parts of the
globe. Some have opted to approach this issue from a utilitarian
perspective, either by providing purely technical assistance or by
molding democratic models of engagement to the local context. Others
perceive the Western democratic model as simply one of many different
forms of governance. While Russia and China are not particularly keen
for a European---or, for that matter, Western---leadership model, some
[[countries]{.mark} [in Asia]{.mark}, like India, [and]{.mark} in [South
America]{.mark} [and]{.mark} sub-Saharan [Africa]{.mark}
[find]{.mark}]{.underline} some [**[merit]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the
**[EU]{.mark}** being [involved in]{.mark} **[democracy
promotion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But these countries see such
investment as requiring a lighter touch and a deeper consideration of
local specificities. It is by sharing Europe's own experience and
adopting what the EU's outside partners often consider a less
patronizing attitude that Europe is recognized as a useful partner. So,
while [[there is space for]{.mark} the [EU]{.mark} [to **lead**]{.mark}
in this field]{.underline}, it must choose to do so in a much more
incisive yet nuanced way.
