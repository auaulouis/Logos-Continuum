security cooperation as a topic of interest within Congress generally,
describes broader legislative authorities titled "security cooperation",
explicitly includes and accounts for DOS authority, explains the origins
of the term "security cooperation" as being rooted in the creation of
the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, and is descriptive of all
security cooperation that takes place in a country as falling within the
DSCA's purview

**[[Security cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** (SC)
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} clearly [[a **topic** of current interest to
Congress]{.mark} and the Defense community]{.underline}. **[[In recent
years]{.mark}, several [changes to]{.mark} the [regulatory and statutory
guidance have taken place]{.mark}]{.underline}** that include [the
publication of [a RAND Report reviewing]{.mark} Title 10 authorities for

**[[What Is Security Assistance, What Is Security Cooperation, and Who
Does What]{.mark}?]{.underline}**

While the term \"[security assistance]{.underline}\" (SA) [has been
in]{.underline} frequent [use]{.underline} in the Department of Defense
(DoD) [since]{.underline} at least [1971]{.underline}, 6 the term
\"[[security cooperation\" was]{.mark} first
[introduced]{.mark}]{.underline} [[by]{.mark} the]{.underline} Defense
Reform Initiative [in 1997]{.underline}. 7 The Defense Reform Initiative
led to [the Defense Security Assistance Agency]{.underline} (DSAA) being
[renamed the [**D**efense **S**ecurity **C**ooperation
**A**gency]{.mark}]{.underline} (DSCA), effective 1 October 1998, 8 to
reflect the enlarged mission and additional international programs DSCA
would go on to administer. [These [programs]{.mark} are [carried out by
SCOs and]{.mark} DoD [Regional Centers]{.mark} for Security
Studies]{.underline}. 9 **[[Explanation and definitions of SA and SC are
provided herein]{.underline}]{.mark}**, followed by more information on
SCOs and DoD Centers for Security Studies.

\[\*50\] Security Assistance

**[[Security assistance]{.mark} primarily encompasses foreign military
financing and sales, military education and training, peacekeeping, and
counter-narcotics efforts.]{.underline}** 10 Department of Defense
Directive (DoDD) 5132.03, reissued on 29 December 2016, defines SA in
conformity with the underlying U.S. Code provision, and specifies that
[SA [is one element within]{.mark}]{.underline} the broader category of
[[SC]{.underline}]{.mark}:

Security Assistance. Group of programs authorized by the Foreign
Assistance Act \[(FAA)\] of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act
\[(AECA)\] of 1976 or other related statutes by which the United States
provides defense articles, military training, and other defense-related
services by grant, loan, credit, or cash sales in furtherance of
national policies and objectives. [Security assistance is one element of
security cooperation]{.underline}, which is [funded and authorized by
the Department of State and **[administered by the
DSCA]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[This definition received additional minor modifications in
the]{.underline} 23 May [2017, Joint Publication]{.underline} 3-20,
[Security Cooperation]{.underline}. 11 The only substantive
modifications were [adding \"lease]{.underline}\" to the methods of
providing defense articles, [changing that assistance is authorized
\"through]{.underline}\" Department of [State rather than
\"by]{.underline}\" Department of [State, and **adding DoD as
administering in conjunction with DSCA**]{.underline}. 12 [The most
substantive update]{.underline} contained within both DoDD 5132.03 and
Joint Publication 3-20 [is]{.underline} the recognition [that security
assistance is one element of security cooperation]{.underline}.

**[[Security Cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**

While this [**[term was the product of]{.mark}** the 1997 Defense Reform
Initiative]{.underline}, 13 [and entered the DoD lexicon with
**[the]{.mark}** renaming of DSAA to **[DSCA]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
October 1998, 14 [security cooperation [remained ill-defined
until]{.mark}]{.underline} 9 June [[2004]{.mark}, when it was [first
formally defined]{.mark}]{.underline} within Joint Publication 1-02:

**[All DoD interactions with foreign defense establishments to build
defense relationships that promote specific U.S. security interests,
develop allied and friendly military capabilities for self-defense and
multinational operations, and provide U.S. forces with peacetime and
contingency access to a host nation.]{.underline}** 15

[[That broad definition has continued to take shape,]{.mark} with 10
U.S.C.]{.underline} Ch. 16 § 301 [currently defining security
cooperation programs and activities of the DoD as meaning any program,
activity (including an exercise), or interaction of the DoD with the
security establishment of a foreign country to achieve a purpose as
follows: build and develop allied and friendly security capabilities for
self-defense and multinational operations; to provide the armed forces
with access to the foreign country during peacetime or a contingency
operation; to build relationships that promote specific U.S. security
interests]{.underline}. 16

**[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**epartment **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f
**[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense Directive 5132.03, [[reissued]{.mark}
on]{.underline} 29 December [2016, includes [a definition of]{.mark} SC
in conformity with the underlying U.S. Code provision, and, like the
current definition for SA, specifies that SA is included within
SC:]{.underline}

[[**Security Cooperation**.]{.mark} All DoD interactions with foreign
defense establishments to build defense relationships that promote
specific U.S. security interests, develop allied and partner nation
military and security capabilities for self-defense and multinational
operations, and provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency
access to allied and partner nations. This also includes
DoD-administered security assistance programs]{.underline}.

[This definition received an additional minor modification
in]{.underline} the 23 May [2017, Joint Publication]{.underline} 3-20,
[Security Cooperation, replacing the word \"defense\" relationships with
\"security\" relationships]{.underline}.

Defense Security Assistance Agency, Security Cooperation Offices, and
Regional Centers for Security Studies

**[[The DSCA\'s mission is to]{.mark} lead the Security Cooperation
Community (SCC) in [develop]{.mark}ing [and
executing]{.mark}]{.underline}** innovative **[[security
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** solutions that support mutual U.S.
and partner interests. 17 [This]{.underline} mission [is **executed
[through SCOs]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which bring together DoD security
cooperation and DoS security assistance efforts, as well as DoD Regional
Centers for Security Studies which act as venues for international
discussion and course work teaching security cooperation.]{.underline}
**[While [DSCA falls under the DoD and is]{.mark} thus [a Title 10
entity]{.mark}, [it draws]{.mark} its [authorities]{.mark} to establish
and operate SCOs [from]{.mark} Title 22 under [the DoS,]{.mark} a
structure [which indicates Congress\'s desire that DoD and DoS
synchronize security cooperation efforts.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[[Security Cooperation Offices]{.mark} are [authorized
by]{.mark}]{.underline} section 515 of [the Foreign Assistance Act of
1961]{.underline}. 18 Through that provision, [[Congress]{.mark}
authorized]{.underline} the President to [[assign]{.underline}
**[members of the Armed Forces]{.underline}**]{.mark} of the United
States [to a foreign country to [carry out]{.mark} the President\'s
duties]{.underline} under the FAA and AECA [to perform]{.underline}
**[[one]{.mark} or more [of seven]{.mark} enumerated
[functions]{.mark}]{.underline}**: (1) **[[equipment and services case
management]{.underline}]{.mark}**; (2) **[[training
management]{.underline}]{.mark}**; (3) **[[program
monitoring]{.underline}]{.mark}**; (4) **[[evaluation and planning of
the host government\'s military capabilities and
requirements]{.underline}]{.mark}**; (5) **[[administrative
support]{.underline}]{.mark}**; (6) **[[promoting rationalization,
standardization, interoperability, and other defense cooperation
measures]{.underline}]{.mark}**; **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** (7)
**[[liaison functions exclusive of advisory and training
assistance]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Notably, **[advisory and training assistance is limited]{.underline}**
under 22 U.S.C. § 2321i(b):

Advisory and training assistance conducted by military personnel
assigned under this section shall be kept to an absolute minimum. It is
the sense of the Congress that advising and training assistance in
countries to which military personnel are assigned under this section
shall be provided primarily by other personnel who are not assigned
under this section and who are detailed for limited periods to perform
specific tasks.

[Security Cooperation Organization is defined]{.underline} in DoDI
5132.13 [as]{.underline}:

[All DoD elements located in a foreign country with assigned
responsibilities for carrying out security
cooperation]{.underline}/assistance \[\*51\] [management
functions]{.underline}. [It includes military assistance advisory
groups, military missions and groups, offices of defense and military
cooperation, liaison groups, and defense attaché personnel designated to
perform security cooperation/assistance functions]{.underline}. 19

[[Security Cooperation Offices go by different names, with different
mission sets, in different countries]{.underline}]{.mark}. Examples, in
addition to the Office of Security Cooperation - Iraq, are the United
States Military Training Mission (USMTM) in Saudi Arabia; 20 the Office
of Military Cooperation - Egypt; 21 Office of Defense Cooperation -
India; 22 and Office of Defense Representative - Pakistan. 23 . [While
each of these organizations carries a different name]{.underline},
**[[they all]{.underline}]{.mark}** perform an SA mission involving
Foreign Military Sales and International Military Education and
Training, and all **[[play a role in security cooperation
efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}** such as training exercises.

#### B\-\--Violation\-\--we'll concede a genuine we meet or this will be the 2NR

#### C\-\--Standards

#### Limits\-\--Security cooperation is vague and broad. Requiring the aff go through the DSCA is the only limit on the topic

#### Ground\-\--there's no core ground with link uniqueness against security cooperation broadly. DSCA is the only core disad. Smart plan wordings mean CP's that PIC out of the DSCA lose to perms which means it's only a question of disad ground. 

### Yes DSCA\-\--2NC

#### The aff must go through DSCA. It's the only limit on the topic and is normal means for [all]{.underline} security cooperation.

[[Security cooperation is now a term that encompasses \"any program,

with the security establishment of a foreign country to achieve a
\[strategic\] purpose]{.mark}]{.underline} . . . \[.\]\" 85 \[85 10
U.S.C. § 301(7) (2017). [[Congress articulates three purposes]{.mark}
for security cooperation: \"to build and develop allied and friendly
security capabilities for self-defense and multinational operations; to
provide the armed forces with access to the foreign country during
peacetime or a contingency operation; to build relationships that
promote specific United States security interests. Id.\] The DoD assigns
such strategic importance to security cooperation that, **with the help
of [Congress]{.mark}, it [created the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency]{.mark}** (**DSCA**) **[to direct and guide the execution of
all]{.mark}** DoD **[security cooperation]{.mark}**
programs.]{.underline} 86 \[86 U.S. GOV\'T ACCOUNTABILITY OFF.,

ENHANCE PROGRAM MANAGEMENT 4 (2012) ([[The]{.underline}]{.mark}
\"\[Defense Security Cooperation Agency ([[DSCA)\] oversees]{.mark}
program administration for both [traditional]{.mark} programs [and
newer]{.mark} \[building partner capacity\] [programs]{.mark}. \[The\]

[With all the money and strategic brainpower pouring into security
cooperation, newcomers to the field may presume fully-vetted,
standardized terms and definitions. However, this could not be further
\[\*656\] from reality.]{.underline}

[[Members of the DoD frequently mischaracterize security
cooperation]{.mark} or outright disagree with respect to its doctrinal
definition.]{.underline} 88 For example, the 2010 National Security
Strategy (NSS) used the term security cooperation to include rebuilding
damaged infrastructure and establishing conditions necessary to end
military operations in Afghanistan. 89 With the exception of combat
operations, **[[it would seem that almost any military action could
fit]{.mark} under the 2010 NSS\'s version of security
cooperation]{.underline}**. 90 Nevertheless, if security cooperation is
in fact an evolving term in the DoD, making sense of the authorities
under which the military executes security cooperation events is even
more troublesome. 91 This is especially true when authorities are based
upon a set of specific terms. Hence, with doctrine lagging behind and
accompanied by undefined terminology, no authority in the realm of
security cooperation is more ambiguous than the authority for
military-to-military contacts. 92 With ambiguity surrounding
military-to-military contacts, planners and lawyers should defer to
commanders to decide the best way to employ these strategic interaction
events. The fate of 10 U.S.C. § 168 and its ultimate repeal is
illustrative of this point.

### Overview\-\--2NC

Security cooperation must go through the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency. Setting a predictable requirement for one component of the aff
mechanism is key to neg ground. Our arg isn't that they can
[only]{.underline} fiat the DSCA, just that they must
[include]{.underline} the DSCA.

Our interpretation has an intent to define, has jurisdictional
expertise, and traces the history of the term to explain why there's so
much confusion\-\--it resolves DOD/DOS confusion because the DSCA
operates under both\-\--the term "security cooperation" didn't exist
[until]{.underline} the DSCA was created in 1998\-\--recent legal
changes mean there is a lot of confusion around the term but it's very
broad, which a. means the scope of possible actions the aff can do is
very large, which makes being neg hard, but b. also means the scope of
actions that fall within the DSCA's jurisdiction is large and includes
the af

## Disad

### DSCA Disad\-\--1NC

#### The Defense Security Cooperation Agency is stream-lining now to get weapons to Ukraine but they're on the brink of being over-stretched by new demands from NATO and the rest of the world. Now is the critical time to lock-in security relationships but reliability is key.

defense industry.\"

//pipk

[[The changed security environment]{.mark} in Europe [will mean
**increased demand** from]{.mark} its [allies for]{.mark} integrated
missile [defenses]{.mark}, early [warning systems]{.mark}, air-to-air
[missiles]{.mark} and **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence,
**[s]{.mark}**urveillance and **[r]{.mark}**econnaissance platforms, a
senior U.S. defense official said Thursday]{.underline}.

The assessment comes as rattled [[European]{.mark} countrie[s are
committing to boost their militaries]{.mark} in the wake of Russia's
invasion of Ukraine.]{.underline} [[U.S.]{.mark} government
[officials]{.mark}, **[while racing to send weapons to
Ukraine]{.mark}**, [are]{.mark} also [working to backfill allies
who]{.mark} have [sent arms]{.mark} to Ukraine [or]{.mark} are keen [to
strengthen]{.mark} their conventional [defenses]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"[[Globally,]{.mark} that [demand is increasing]{.mark}, and I do think
we will continue to explore with our partners how they want to look at
that]{.underline}," Jed Royal, [the deputy director of [the]{.mark}
**[D]{.mark}**efense **[S]{.mark}**ecurity **[C]{.mark}**ooperation
**[A]{.mark}**gency, [said]{.mark}]{.underline} during a call with
reporters. He said needs vary by country.

While the State Department has primary responsibility for approving arms
exports, [**[the DSCA]{.mark}**, a Pentagon agency central to foreign
military sales, **[has]{.mark} taken [a key role in U.S. and allied
efforts to send]{.mark}** and replace billions of dollars worth of
**[weapons]{.mark}** both from existing military supplies and through
new procurements.]{.underline}

"[[DSCA wants to]{.mark} make sure we are [not only]{.mark} thinking in
terms of [backfill]{.mark}ing [the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [but]{.mark} certainly backfill\[ing\] for [allies
and partners as they]{.mark} continue to [support Ukraine]{.mark} as
well," Royal said. "I spend a lot of time with our allies and partners
and \... [the demand is]{.mark} certainly [coming in a really
significant way]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark}

**[Potentially [driving demand, NATO announced]{.mark} this week it
[plans to increase]{.mark} the size of [its rapid reaction force]{.mark}
from 40,000 to 300,000 troops by next year. Forces would be based in
their home countries but deploy further east, where the alliance would
stockpile equipment and ammunition]{.underline}**.

Beyond air defenses, the focus of Europe's defense investments should
shift toward networks, strike weapons and munitions, logistics and base
construction, Capital Alpha Partners Managing Director Byron Callan said
in a note to investors Thursday.

"Open questions remain about how the Russian threat is assessed in
2025-30, how U.S. commitments to NATO are weighed depending on the 2024
\[U.S. presidential\] election outcome, and views on the needs and
capacity of the European defense industrial base," Callan said.

[With an eye on the health of Europe's defense industry, the European
Union has sought to incentivize deals among its members]{.underline}.
Earlier this month, EU officials were expected to meet with member
nation delegates to craft ground rules for a €500 million (U.S. \$523
million) fund meant to promote quick purchases of bloc-made military
equipment.

[[The U.S. has been working with]{.mark} more than 50 [countries to see
what weapons they can send to Ukraine]{.mark}. Though the initial focus
has been on Russian-made weapons Ukrainian forces were familiar with,
Ukraine has received more advanced weapons and the training to go with
them as the war's continued]{.underline}.

**[[DSCA has been part of the Pentagon's]{.mark} internal [efforts to
find and fix defense industrial base]{.mark} [constraints exposed
by]{.mark} the [Ukraine]{.mark} effort[, and it's put new focus on
acquiring nonstandard systems for allies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That
has included the AeroVironment Switchblade 300 loitering munition for
Ukraine, Royal said.

"[We found that there's a lot of systems that are not standard systems
that the U.S. acquires for itself that are nonetheless very valuable and
worthwhile to our partners]{.underline}," Royal said. "[So we're looking
at those non-program-of-record systems and making sure that [we are
using our program offices to]{.mark} **[prioritize]{.mark}** those
[requirements for allies and partners]{.mark} just as we would for more
standard acquisition systems."]{.underline}

[**[Beyond Europe]{.mark}**, **India and other [importers of
weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline} from Russia, the world's No. 2 arms
vendor, [[have had to rethink]{.mark} those [arrangements as]{.mark}
widespread [sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~cripple~~
[\[[hurt]{.mark}\] [Russia's ability to]{.mark} make and [export]{.mark}
defense equipment]{.underline}. Without mentioning any specific
countries, Royal echoed other U.S. officials who have said the west, if
not **[[the U.S., might eat into Russia's market
share]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

"**[[We need to]{.mark} be able to [demonstrate the reliability of
the]{.mark} Western industrial base, the [U.S. industrial base,]{.mark}
a friendly industrial base, in order to be able [to make sure]{.mark}
that [allies and partners globally can find an alternative to Russian
systems in the future]{.mark}]{.underline}**," he said. "That's very
much part of our thinking as well."

#### Security cooperation resources are limited. Plan trades off

Challenges of the 21st Century\"
<https://publications.armywarcollege.edu/pubs/1916.pdf> //pipk

Despite successes in execution, as a strategy, [[security
cooperation]{.mark} still [faces]{.mark} numerous
[challenges]{.mark}.]{.underline} Both [the international and domestic
[strategic environments]{.mark} will [test our abilities to implement a
cooperative strategy framework]{.mark} for the foreseeable
future]{.underline}. The [[conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} in Iraq and
Afghanistan, [domestic [entitlement]{.mark} program[s]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} outdated [legislative authorities]{.mark} will [leave DoD
**struggling to properly resource**]{.mark} the **[activities]{.mark}**
necessary to meet our objectives]{.underline}. DoD must also address
program effectiveness and improve coordination across the U.S.
Government and with our allies.

**[[Resource challenges to security cooperation derive from fiscal
constraints]{.mark}, Operational [Tempo]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(OPTEMPO), **[[Global Force Posturing, and outdated
authorities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. From a fiscal standpoint, the
strategic environment will make the task of addressing our security
challenges problematic for the foreseeable future. DoD's 2007 budget is
projected to be 3.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). As a
percentage of GDP, DoD outlays are historically low and have not kept
pace with the growth of GDP over the last 40 years.31 However, the
rising costs of mandatory government entitlement spending associated
with Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security are projected to account
for 11 percent of the U.S. GDP by 2016 and will exert pressures on a
budget that economic growth alone is unlikely to alleviate.32
Entitlement obligations will likely result in political pressure to
further reduce defense discretionary spending in order to forestall
greater budget deficits. Despite the constrained fiscal environment, DoD
outlays must continue to grow to meet our global engagement
requirements. This should be a continuous strategic communication
message implemented by DoD senior leadership to Congress and the
American people to counter a growing view that the federal government
already spends too much on national defense.33

[Despite having the authority to plan and conduct security cooperation
within their area of responsibility]{.underline} (AOR),
[GCCs]{.underline} currently [lack sufficient dedicated resources to
support their **[security cooperation]{.mark}** strategy]{.underline}.
In addition, existing **[[resources are limited by]{.mark} [multiple and
conflicting policy and legislation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Up to 30
sources of funding regulated by various authorities and guidelines are
required to implement GCC security cooperation
strategies]{.underline}.34 Security Assistance programs like
international military education and training (IMET), foreign military
financing (FMF), and financial management service (FMS) are State
Department funded, and COCOMs have limited ability through the
interagency process to influence where and how this money is spent.35
Other sources like Warsaw Initiative Funding (WIF) and Cooperative
Threat Reduction (CTR) funding support military exercises and capacity
building efforts but continue to come under increased program management
scrutiny. In the past, security cooperation funding by Service
Components has contributed significantly to COCOM plan execution.
However, Service Chiefs face growing fiscal obligations. As an example,
the Army delayed submitting its 2008-13 Program Objective Memorandum in
an effort to avoid a QDR strategy and resource mismatch.36 A mismatch
still exists, and the Army faces a growing problem in funding current
equipment wartime reset requirements and its modernization efforts. In
recent congressional testimony, the Army Chief of Staff outlined the
Army equipment reset bill at \$17.01 billion for FY 2007, with expected
requirements beyond 2007 to be \$12 to \$13 billion per year though the
conflict and a minimum of 2 to 3 years beyond.37 Additionally, the Army
will need nearly \$200 billion for the Future Combat System and its
associated spin-off technologies to meet modernization requirements.38
These [[fiscal realities suggest]{.mark} Service components will have
[fewer resources to dedicate to security
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Service Chiefs, who already have
less interest in engagement programs, struggle to meet their Title 10
responsibilities to train, organize, and equip their forces.39 To
overcome these hurdles, funding streams must be consolidated and reforms
initiated that provide GCCs more influence in the allocation of funding
resources for security cooperation.

**[[COCOMs]{.mark} will also likely [face continued challenges in
finding sufficient resources in the form of military personnel to
conduct security cooperation]{.mark} programs]{.underline}**. The Joint
Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP) does not apportion forces
specifically for security cooperation, and they must come from forces
assigned to a COCOM's AOR or that temporarily deploy for engagement
activities.40 For the foreseeable future, the deployment requirements to
support the GWOT will continue to leave few opportunities for active and
reserve component units to participate in coalition and multinational
exercises. In struggling to meet its surge requirements in Iraq and
Afghanistan, the U.S. military is falling short in its ability to
resource the steady-state deterrence and partner enabling missions
called for in the QDR strategy.41 To address this shortcoming, President
George W. Bush's 2008 budget contains proposed funding for an additional
end-strength increase of 92,000 troops for the Army and Marine Corps by
2013.42 This increase is not only necessary now, but also is required
post-Iraq/Afghanistan. The Army must be forthright and convincing with
the nation's civilian defense leadership about the future force
structure required to meet the myriad of "Boots on the Ground" tasks
necessitated by an uncertain and complex environment.43

[Ukraine won the short war. Mobile and resourceful, its troops inflicted
terrible losses and confounded Russian plans to take Kyiv. Now comes the
long war. It will drain weapons, lives and money until one side loses
the will to fight on. [So far]{.mark}, this is a war that **[Russia is
winning]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[In recent days its forces have taken the eastern city of
Severodonetsk]{.underline}. They are advancing on Lysychansk and may
soon control all of Luhansk province. They also threaten Slovyansk, in
the north of next-door Donetsk. Ukrainian leaders say they are outgunned
and lack ammunition. Their government reckons as many as 200 of its
troops are dying each day.

[[Fortunately]{.mark} for Ukraine, [that is not the end]{.mark}. [The
Russian advance is slow and costly]{.mark}. **[With nato]{.mark}-calibre
[weapons]{.mark}, fresh tactics [and]{.mark} enough financial
[aid]{.mark}, [Ukraine has every chance]{.mark} of forcing back Russia's
armies.**]{.underline} Even if lost territory will be hard to retake,
**[[Ukraine can demonstrate the futility of]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Vladimir **[[Putin's campaign]{.mark} and emerge as a democratic,
Westward-looking state. [But]{.mark} to do so [it needs]{.mark} enduring
[support. And that is still in doubt]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[On the face of it, a long war suits Russia]{.underline}. [Both sides
are using huge amounts of ammunition, but Russia has vastly more. The
Russian economy is much larger than Ukraine's and in far better
shape.]{.underline} In pursuit of victory, Russia is willing to
terrorise and demoralise the Ukrainians by committing war crimes, as it
did by striking a shopping mall in Kremenchuk this week. If needs be, Mr
Putin will impose grievous suffering on his own people.

[However, the long war does not have to be fought on Mr Putin's
terms]{.underline}. Potentially, **[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}** has
vast numbers of motivated fighters. It **[[can be supplied by the West's
defence industry]{.mark}. In 2020, before sanctions, the economies of
nato were more than ten times bigger than Russia's.]{.underline}**

Ukraine's turnaround begins on the battlefield, by stopping and
reversing the Russian advance. Mr Putin's generals will continue to have
more weapons, but **[[the sophisticated nato systems now arriving
have]{.mark} longer [range and]{.mark} greater
[accuracy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [By adopting tactics devised in the
cold war, when nato too was outnumbered by the Red Army, [Ukraine should
be able to destroy]{.mark} Russian command [posts and]{.mark} supply
[depots]{.mark}. Ukraine scored a success [on June 30th]{.mark}, when
[it used nato weapons to drive Russia]{.mark}n forces [off Snake Island,
a strategic prize]{.mark} in the Black Sea. [It should aim to impose a
"**hurting stalemate**",]{.mark} in which it takes back similarly
symbolically important territory, such as the city of Kherson, imposing
a heavy price on Russia.]{.underline}

**[[If Russia starts to lose ground]{.mark} on the battlefield, [dissent
and infighting may spread in the Kremlin]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Western
intelligence services believe that Mr [Putin is being kept in the dark
by his subordinates. He has a habit of replacing his
commanders]{.underline}---reportedly including General Alexander
Dvornikov, brought in after the invasion's first chaotic weeks. The West
can raise the cost to Russia of a long war by continuing to press
sanctions, which threaten lasting harm to Russia's economy. It can split
Russia's elites from Mr Putin by welcoming dissenters from business and
politics, and encouraging them to see that their country should not
throw away its future on a pointless and costly campaign.

**[Will the West stay the course]{.underline}**? At a summit on June
23rd, the European Union awarded Ukraine candidate status, promising a
deep level of engagement over the next decade. At another summit in
Germany this week, the g7 affirmed and strengthened sanctions against
Russia. And at a third in Madrid, nato acknowledged the Russian threat
by substantially increasing its presence on the alliance's eastern
front.

Yet [[Ukraine is a heavy burden]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[Western
defence industries are formidable, but struggle to produce large
volumes]{.mark}, especially of ammunition.]{.underline}** Ukraine's
government has a monthly deficit of \$5bn and the country will need
rebuilding after the war. [[Public support]{.mark} for Ukraine in the
West [will be buffeted by]{.mark} a host of [pressures]{.mark}, from
inflation to elections---including, as soon as 2023, campaigning in
America that may involve a presidential bid by that Ukrainophobic Putin
admirer, Donald Trump.]{.underline}

And [[the global costs of a long war will grow]{.underline}]{.mark}. Mr
[Putin has been blockading exports of grains and sunflower oil from
Ukraine's ports, which will cause unrest and starvation in poorer
importing countries]{.underline}. [He seems to be trying to create gas
shortages in the eu this winter by preventing members from building
stocks over the summer. If unity falls apart over energy, as eu states
hoard gas, it will disintegrate over Ukraine, too. To complicate matters
further, nato members worry that if Ukraine gains the upper hand, Mr
Putin will escalate. That could draw them into a catastrophic war with
Russia]{.underline}.

You can see where Mr Putin is heading. He will take as much of Ukraine
as he can, declare victory and then call on Western nations to impose
his terms on Ukraine. In exchange, he will spare the rest of the world
from ruin, hunger, cold and the threat of nuclear Armageddon.

[To accept that deal would be a grave miscalculation. Ukraine would face
permanent Russian aggression. **[The more]{.mark} Mr [Putin believes he
has succeeded]{.mark} in Ukraine, [the more belligerent he will
become]{.mark}**]{.underline}. He set out his ambitions in a speech this
month, smirking as he talked about how Peter the Great seized parts of
Sweden. **[[He will fight tomorrow with whatever weapons work]{.mark}
for him [today]{.mark}. That means resorting to [war crimes and nuclear
threats]{.mark}, [starving the world and freezing
Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[[The best way to prevent the next war is to defeat him in this
one]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Leaders need to explain to their people that
they are not only defending an abstract principle in Ukraine, but also
their most fundamental interest: their own security. The eu needs to
shore up its energy markets so that they do not fracture next winter.
[**[Ukraine must have more weapons]{.mark}.** The risk of escalation
today is real, **but [if a bad peace is forced on
Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline} Mr [[**Putin's nuclear threats
will**]{.mark} not stop. They will only **[become more
dangerous]{.mark}**, especially if Russia's conventional forces are at a
disadvantage]{.underline}.

In the long war ordinary Russians will suffer and Ukrainians endure
unspeakable pain for Mr Putin's vanity. [[To prevail means marshalling
resources and shoring up Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} as a viable,
sovereign, Western-leaning country---an outcome that its defiant people
crave. Ukraine and its backers have the men, money and materiel to
overcome Mr Putin. Do they all have the will?

In addition to host nation and interagency relationships, [a **SCO**
[may face challenges working within the joint DoD community]{.mark}.
[Mission sets, agendas, priorities, personalities and egos
abound]{.mark} in foreign countries where there is a sizable DoD
presence]{.underline}. At the very least, there are instances when
**[DoD [commanders lean]{.mark} far [forward to get a particular mission
accomplished without full appreciation for the
implications]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is understandable, especially
if local commanders rotate frequently. SCO personnel, who are more
permanent, should anticipate and mitigate these issues through strong
working relationships.

To illustrate how **[[varying mission sets among DoD components
operating in a host nation can create challenges]{.mark},]{.underline}**
[consider the following]{.underline} scenario: [[the Army requests
\"X]{.mark}\" from the host nation [to accomplish \"Y\",]{.mark} while
[the Air Force needs \"A\"]{.mark} from the host nation [to accomplish
\"B.\"]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[The]{.mark}** Air Force\'s **[request
for \"A\" will make it difficult for the host nation to grant]{.mark}**
the Army\'s request for \"**[X]{.mark}**.]{.underline}\" [Meanwhile, off
the coast the Navy is routinely doing \"Z\" near host nation territorial
waters. The host nation has declared it will not answer any request from
the U.S. military until the Navy stops doing \"Z.\"]{.underline} In this
scenario, [**[the SCO is the narrow part of the funnel where these
issues collide]{.mark}**. [The Army and Air Force]{.mark} [may
not]{.mark} know or [care]{.mark}]{.underline} \[\*38\] [[about]{.mark}
the Navy doing [\"Z,\"]{.mark} [and they]{.mark} each are likely to
[hold their respective requests as paramount]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, the Navy\'s \"Z\" operations may be entirely legitimate (it
also may not know or care about the Air Force and Army needs).

#### Security cooperation resources are limited. The plan drains money, time, and policy attention from other priorities. Even small distruptions have magnified effect because it hurts our leverage to mobilize other resources

//pipk

This list of capabilities may strike the reader as either entirely too
large to focus U.S. [[Security Cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}, or
woefully incomplete. As to the first objection, the USG already
[conducts]{.underline} a large number of [programs]{.underline} to
address virtually all the items [[on]{.underline}]{.mark} this list and
many more, though [in a fragmented and non-synchronized
manner]{.underline}. Regarding the second objection, while there are
many worthwhile capabilities that could be added to the list,
**[[limited resources]{.mark} \-- [not just money, but]{.mark} also
[time and policy attention]{.mark} \-- [require us to
focus]{.mark}]{.underline}** primarily on those capabilities that
directly support the fight against strategic crime. The capabilities
listed, in many cases, contribute to satisfying more than one American
strategic priority (see Figure 1). [[It is not]{.underline}]{.mark} be
[[possible]{.mark}, of course, for the U.S. [to assist all]{.mark} of
its [partners with every capability]{.mark}]{.underline} on this list,
[which is why **[prioritization is essential]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
Whether or not you agree with all of the items on the list or believe
that others should be added, [[the important thing is to develop
a]{.underline}]{.mark} [[unified]{.underline}]{.mark} interagency
[[position]{.mark} [concerning]{.mark} which capabilities deserve
[focus]{.mark}]{.underline} by country and region in order [[to craft
integrated strategies for applying U.S. Security Cooperation
resources]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Identification of Resources [[A strategic approach]{.mark} to building
partner capabilities [requires]{.mark} the [identification and
mobilization of resources]{.mark}]{.underline}. U.S. assistance programs
alone cannot and should not bear the burden for building all of the
capabilities in the worldwide NOFS. [**[U.S. leadership, enabled by a
vision for increased cooperation]{.mark}**, strategic planning,
[and]{.mark} carefully targeted [incentives to prompt partner nations to
support U.S. priorities, can set the conditions for
success]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Resources]{.underline}]{.mark} to build
partner capabilities [[are available at the
national]{.underline}]{.mark}, intermediate or regional, and global
[[levels]{.underline}]{.mark}.106

#### The brink is low. Each increase in security cooperation risks other priorities. Congress has sufficiently streamlined now but continuing to avoid patchwork security cooperation is key to deterrence. Fiscal year restrictions means even minor delays can spillover

LEGISLATION, 226 Mil. L. Rev. 147. Nexis //pipk

While engagement with foreign states is typically within the purview of
the DoS, 179 [the last fifteen years has seen a growing emphasis on the
role of the DoD in **[security cooperation]{.mark}**
activities]{.underline}. 180 [Corresponding to that]{.underline}
\[\*184\] [increased role, Congress enabled the DoD to respond to
threats and build partner capacity through a myriad of authorities and
associated funding]{.underline}. 181 **[The [increase]{.mark} in the
number of authorities permitting the DoD to engage with foreign
militaries]{.underline}**, though instrumental in commanders\' efforts
to improve interoperability in combined operations, **[resulted in a
security cooperation enterprise that [is]{.mark} incredibly [cumbersome,
complicating the ability of the DoD to effectively prioritize, plan,
execute, and oversee]{.mark} these [activities]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
182

[The FY17 [NDAA attempted to streamline]{.mark} the [security
cooperation]{.mark} enterprise [by consolidating]{.mark} various train
and equip [authorities]{.mark} into one statute and codifying other
security cooperation authorities into one chapter of Title 10 of the
U.S. Code]{.underline}. 183 [[While]{.mark} [this]{.mark} reform
[represented]{.mark} a vast [improvement to]{.mark} the previous
[patchwork]{.mark} of legal [authorities and assist]{.mark} DoD [efforts
to build capacity]{.mark} in the Baltic States under EDI]{.underline},
[[Congress]{.mark} can and [should continue]{.mark} to improve security
cooperation laws [to maximize]{.mark} its [impact in deterring Russian
aggression]{.mark} against NATO allies]{.underline}. 184 Two courses of
action Congress can take to improve efforts in accordance with the
intent of EDI is to 1) authorize multi-year appropriations for EDI
activities and 2) exempt certain expenditures of jointly procured
equipment and military construction with certain allies, such as the
Baltic States and Poland, from DoS concurrence.

1\. Relax Funding Restrictions on Periods of Availability [Most of the
authorities within the [security cooperation]{.mark} enterprise
[have]{.mark} a current [fiscal year]{.mark} period of
[availability]{.mark}, 185 permitting the \[\*185\] obligation of
appropriated funds only within the current fiscal year.]{.underline} 186
[[However, the complex nature of security cooperation **makes it
difficult**]{.mark} for commanders [to identify needs, plan an activity,
coordinate appropriately, and receive authorization all within one
fiscal year]{.mark}]{.underline}. 187 While the FY17 NDAA permitted
training and exercises to cross fiscal years, if started in one and
completed in another, 188 [**[time remains a severe constraint
on]{.mark}** most **[security cooperation]{.mark}**
activities]{.underline}. Additional [time to plan]{.underline}
activities [will lead to better use of funds, serving a dual benefit of
providing better products to foreign forces and more appropriately
utilizing U.S. resources]{.underline}. The flexibility gained by
relaxing the time constraints will permit the DoD to complete
construction projects that would otherwise not get approved despite the
apparent necessity as it is nearly impossible to manage under current
the authorities. Lengthening the time of the authorities would also
permit planning more complex exercises, which is especially important in
areas such as cyber defense and hybrid warfare that are particularly
relevant to NATO\'s counter-Russian aggression strategy. 189 Such relief
would likewise enable U.S. forces to complete construction projects and
\"to accommodate delays in the ordering and delivery of equipment\" in
NATO partner-nations. 190 Adjusting the period of availability of
security cooperation funds to \"two-year funding could better account
for the unpredictability of foreign partner schedules.\" 191

#### Security cooperation coordination is hard. It has to be approved by [senior-most echelons]{.underline}, which means even small things like the plan are [cumbersome]{.underline} and [time-intensive]{.underline}. That takes out solvency but not the link.

DETERRING RUSSIAN AGGRESSION AGAINST THE BALTIC STATES THROUGH FISCAL
LEGISLATION, 226 Mil. L. Rev. 147. Nexis //pipk

2\. Provide Exemptions from DoS Coordination [Another way Congress can
help streamline the [security cooperation]{.mark} process is to
legislate exemptions for certain activities from prior
[coordination]{.mark} [between DoD and DoS]{.mark}]{.underline}. [There
is the potential for relatively low-cost, high-reward activities that
may not be possible if the planning [takes **too
long**]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[Congress recognized [the process for
coordination]{.mark} between the two departments [on security
cooperation]{.mark} programs \"[is too ad-hoc in nature and]{.mark}
often [elevates responsibility]{.mark} for such coordination,
particularly those requiring concurrence, [to the senior-most
echelons]{.mark} of the respective organizations\--to include the Deputy
Secretary or [Secretary level]{.mark}\--[resulting in a cumbersome and
time-intensive process]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\" 195 Although the
legislative history is clear, Congress intended for the secretaries to
\"designate individuals at the lowest level in their respective
organizations with responsibility for such coordination,\" 196 the
**[[new laws]{.underline}]{.mark}** still **[[require concurrence and
coordination at the secretary level]{.mark}.]{.underline}** 197

\[\*187\] Foreign assistance and [security cooperation are traditionally
diplomatic functions]{.underline}; however, the nature of coalition
defense requires a singular voice, and in many cases, that voice should
come from the Secretary of Defense. [Thus, for small-scale projects that
support the mission essential tasks of the combatant commander, Congress
should limit the requirements for pre-coordination and
concurrence]{.underline}. [Rather than require additional levels of
[bureaucratic red tape]{.mark} that [limit the utility and effectiveness
of an otherwise useful security cooperation authorization]{.mark},
Congress could exempt logistic support, loans of military equipment, and
certain small-scale construction projects from the requirement of prior
DoS concurrence for each activity]{.underline}. By shifting the focus
from prior coordination to reporting, the DoS and Congress will maintain
oversight while allowing the DoD the necessary flexibility to provide
support when and where it is needed. The exemption from inter-agency
concurrence could be for specified equipment, dollar thresholds, as well
as for properly vetted and approved recipient countries, such as the
Baltic States and Poland, that have supported the United States in its
operations in Afghanistan, meet the NATO defense spending thresholds,
support democracy, human rights and civilian control of the military,
and have a clear connection to the United States\' security interests.

#### Implementation is [difficult]{.underline}. Patchwork authorization laws create confusion about statutory authority and risk draining appropriations for other activities

Authorities and Funding

[**[S]{.mark}**ecurity **[C]{.mark}**ooperation **[O]{.mark}**ffice[s
derive]{.mark} their [authorities and funding from a variety of
sources,]{.mark} but predominately through appropriations under Title
10, Title 22, and release of funds held in the Security Assistance
Administrative Trust Fund, which is a depository account held by Defense
Finance and Accounting Service for administrative fees paid by host
nations on foreign military sales cases]{.underline}.

[The complexity of SCO authorities and funding can be highlighted by a
comparison of three recent reports]{.underline}: RAND\'s February 2016
From Patchwork to Framework: A Review of Title 10 Authorities for
Security Cooperation, 42 Congressional Research Service (CRS)\'s August
2016 DoD Security Cooperation: An Overview of Authorities and Issues, 43
and GAO\'s March 2017 Building Partner Capacity: Inventory of Department
of Defense Security Cooperation and Department of State\'s Security
Assistance Efforts. 44

[The RAND report catalogs 123 Title 10 authorities relating to SC, which
it notes are in addition to statutes in Title 22 and other legislation,
as well as programs that arise out of appropriations rather than
authorizations, with a resulting conclusion that **[delivery of security
cooperation is]{.mark} increasingly [difficult for]{.mark} the DoD
[personnel who develop, plan, and execute initiatives with foreign
partners]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 45

The CRS report estimates [[there are \"more than 80 separate
authorities]{.underline}]{.mark} to assist and engage with foreign
governments, militaries, security forces, and populations\....\" 46 It
goes on to state that [other organizations have adopted different
counting methodologies, resulting in a larger number of
authorities]{.underline}, noting a different, earlier RAND report from
2013, titled Review of Security Cooperation Mechanisms Combatant
Commands Utilize to Build Partner Capacity, 47 **[which listed 184
separate authorities,]{.underline}** including authorities under Titles
6, 22, 32, 42, 50, public laws, and executive orders. 48

**[The GAO, in its report, identified 194]{.underline}** DoD SC and DoS
SA **[efforts]{.underline}** that may be used to build partner capacity
to address security-related threats. 49 Of those, eighty-seven are DoD
efforts requiring some level of DoS involvement, and thirty are DoS
efforts requiring some level of DoD involvement. 50

Upon review of the draft report, the Office of the Assistant Secretary
of Defense (OASD) responded that the GAO\'s study methodology was
flawed. Reasons included that a number of listed efforts are not
\[\*53\] used to build partner capacity, such as the
Afghanistan-Pakistan Hands program, Bi-Lateral Meetings, and Counterpart
Visits of Senior Foreign Officials. 51 Additionally, OASD noted that the
report\'s conflation of terms such as \"programs,\" \"activities,\" and
\"authorities\" leads to an overall inventory that is misleading and
repetitive. For example, \"Global Train and Equip\" authority under 10
U.S.C. § 2282 is cited only once, while \"Multilateral, bilateral, or
regional cooperation programs: payment of personnel expenses\" authority
under 10 U.S.C. § 1051 is described as an \"activity\" and cited at
least twenty-three times. 52 Moreover, the report did not include
updates for the FY2017 NDAA, which included modification or repeal of at
least twenty-one authorities. 53 The letter stated that the 2016 RAND
report may serve as a more accurate reference for DoD SC authorities. 54

The 2016 RAND report includes an appendix listing authorities,
categorized as activity-based, mission-based, or partner-based, and
further breaking each of those categories out into subgroups. It also
lists twenty-seven SC programs introduced through appropriations
legislation or other means. 55

**[The activity-based [authority subgroups are: military-to-military
engagements]{.mark}; [exercises]{.mark}; individual education/technical
[training]{.mark}; unit [train and equip]{.mark}; equipment and
[logistics]{.mark} support; research, development, test, and evaluation
([RDT&E]{.mark}); [intel]{.mark}ligence [sharing]{.mark} and
exchange]{.underline}**. 56

[The mission-based subgroups are: humanitarian
assistance/[health]{.mark}; defense [institution building]{.mark};
counter-[narcotics]{.mark}; cooperative threat reduction and
[nonprolif]{.mark}eration; [counterterror]{.mark}ism; cooperative
ballistic [missile defense; maritime security; and
cybersecurity]{.mark}]{.underline}. 57

**[The [partner-based authorities]{.mark} are not subgrouped, but
[include]{.mark} authorities for]{.underline}** Afghanistan, Burma,
Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Pakistan, Syria, Uganda, and Ukraine, as well as
**[regional authorities encompassing]{.underline}** Africa,
**[[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the Independent States of the Former
Soviet Union, the Indo-Asia-Pacific Region, and the Levant. 58

Three clear takeaways that can be consistently drawn from a review of
these reports are: (1) [[SC encompasses a vast number of authorities and
appropriations which may be onerous to navigate at the SCO
level]{.mark};]{.underline} (2) **[Given the number and broad range of
authorities, it is likely that [whatever SC-related activity an SCO is
interested in performing]{.mark} it [is covered by an authority with a
corresponding appropriation]{.mark}; the challenge is identifying it
early enough in the planning cycle to allow time to confirm fund
availability]{.underline}**; (3) [Close
[coordination]{.mark}]{.underline} with the GCC, DSCA, and DoS
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[be necessary to ensure funds are
available]{.mark} to the SCO [to conduct the desired security
cooperation activity]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

For a judge advocate beginning an assignment at an SCO, one of the first
priorities should be to learn what authorities the SCO has historically
relied on. Depending on the size and staff structure of the SCO, that
may mean coordination with \[\*54\] the SCO J-3/5 and J-8, or reaching
back to COCOM staff to inquire.

Throughout an assignment at an SCO, judge advocates can add value to
planning cycles by reminding staff to always consider the source of
authorities in planning future activities. [The broad range of [security
cooperation activities]{.mark} also [create]{.mark}s [an environment
where an **unauthorized commitment may occur**]{.mark} if a proper
fiscal analysis is not performed [or if availability of funds is not
confirmed in advance]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Ukraine Aid High\-\--2NC

#### Big new package is coming

**VOA News 7/2,** \"US Announces \$820 Million Military Aid Package for
Ukraine\"
<https://www.voanews.com/a/us-announces-820-million-military-aid-package-for-ukraine-/6642302.html>
//pipk

The United States announced details Friday of \$820 million in
additional military aid for Ukraine, including new surface-to-air
missile systems and counter-artillery radar.

The latest aid package is designed to help Ukraine counter Russia\'s use
of long-range missiles and follows calls by Ukrainian officials for
Western countries to send more advanced weapons systems that can better
match Moscow\'s equipment.

The Pentagon said Friday the Biden administration has now sent \$7.6
billion in security assistance to Ukraine, including nearly \$7 billion
since the start of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine at the end of February.

U.S. President Joe Biden said at a news conference during this week\'s
NATO summit in Madrid that the United States is \"going to support
Ukraine as long as it takes.\"

The 14th U.S. package of military aid for Ukraine include two air
defense systems, known as NASAMS, which can help Ukrainian forces defend
against cruise missiles and aircraft.

continues, in Bakhmut, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine in this still image

A senior U.S. official said the systems are NATO-standard defense
systems and are part of an effort to update Ukraine\'s air defenses from
a Soviet-era system to a modern one.

\"The Ukrainians are doing a magnificent job of employing their existing
air defense systems, but we all know that Soviet-type systems means that
it\'s Russian made ... so over time it will be harder to sustain with
the spare parts,\" the official said.

The latest military aid package also provides Ukrainians with up to
150,000 rounds of 155-millimeter artillery ammunition as well as
additional ammunition for medium-range rocket systems the United States
provided Ukraine in June.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his daily address, "I am
especially grateful to the United States of America and personally to
Biden for the new support package for Ukraine. \... We are no less
actively negotiating about other new weapons from our partners. \...We
are doing everything to break the advantage of the occupiers."

On the battlefront Friday, at least 21 people were killed and dozens
injured in Russian missile strikes in Ukraine\'s Odesa region. At least
one of the sites that were hit was a residential building. Ukrainian
military officials said two children were among the dead, and the search
for survivors is ongoing.

The missile struck the nine-story building in the town of
Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, according to a Ukraine Defense Ministry
statement.

Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesperson for the Odesa regional administration,
said on Ukrainian state television that a rescue operation continues to
free people buried under the rubble after a section of the building
collapsed. Another missile hit a resort facility, Bratchuk said,
wounding several people.

Russia has denied targeting civilians in the attack.

\"I would like to remind you of the president\'s words that the Russian
Armed Forces do not work with civilian targets,\" Kremlin spokesperson
Dmitry Peskov said.

Zelenskyy\'s chief of staff accused Russia of waging a war on civilians.

In his nightly video address Friday, Zelenskyy called the strikes
\"conscious, deliberately targeted Russian terror and not some sort of
error or a coincidental missile strike.\"

Ukrainian State Emergency Service firefighters work at a damaged
residential building in the town of Serhiivka, about 50 kilometers
southwest of Odesa, Ukraine, July 1, 2022.

residential building in the town of Serhiivka, about 50 kilometers

Zelenskyy also said 12 missiles also hit Mykolaiv.

Friday\'s missile attack in Odesa came hours after Russia said it had
pulled its forces from Ukraine\'s Snake Island on Thursday. The
strategic island had become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance since
Moscow\'s invasion four months ago.

Russia had used the Black Sea island near Odesa as a staging ground
after seizing it in the early stages of the war, launching attacks on
Ukraine from it and monitoring shipments from Ukrainian ports.

Ukraine confirmed Russian forces had pulled out after Ukrainian forces
hit the island with missile and artillery strikes overnight, leaving the
remaining Russian forces to escape in two speedboats.

The Russian Defense Ministry claimed it had left the small island \"as a
symbol of goodwill\" after completing its mission there.

A senior U.S. official said the United States does \"not believe there
is any credence to what Russia is saying, that this is a gesture of
goodwill.\" The official said the retreat was more about Ukraine\'s
efforts to defend the island and Kyiv\'s use of weapons like harpoon
missiles.

\"The Ukrainians made it very hard for the Russians to sustain their
operations there, made them very vulnerable to Ukrainian strikes,\" the
official said.

In other developments, European Commission President Ursula von der
Leyen told Ukraine\'s parliament that EU membership was \"within reach\"
but urged them to press forward with anti-corruption reforms.

\"You have created an impressive anti-corruption machine,\" she told the
lawmakers by video link Friday. Von der Leyen stressed that Brussels and
the EU member states were firmly behind Ukraine in both its battle with
the ongoing Russian invasion and the quest to be \"reunited with our
European family.\"

For his part Zelenskyy said Ukraine and the European Union were starting
a new chapter of their history after Brussels formally accepted
Ukraine\'s candidacy to join the 27-nation bloc.

\"We made a journey of 115 days to candidate status and our journey to
membership shouldn\'t take decades. We should make it down this road
quickly,\" Zelenskyy said.

At the NATO meeting in Madrid, Western leaders, including Biden,
proclaimed their continued military and humanitarian support for
Ukraine.

Norway announced \$1 billion in aid to Ukraine over two years, as
Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store visited the country.

The fund is for \"humanitarian aid, reconstruction of the country,
weapons and operational support to the (Ukrainian) authorities,\" the
Norwegian government said in a statement Friday.

\"We stand together with the Ukrainian people,\" Store said in the
statement.

\"We help support the Ukrainians\' struggle for freedom. They are
fighting for their country, but also for our democratic values.\"

#### Ukraine aid coming. It's key to victory

Joe **Gould 6/15**, senior Pentagon reporter for Defense News. \"US
sending Ukraine new \$1 billion arms package amid grinding Donbas
fight\"
<https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2022/06/15/us-sending-ukraine-new-1-billion-arms-package-amid-grinding-donbas-fight/>
//pipk

The U.S. will send Ukraine another \$1 billion in weapons to fight
Russia, including Harpoon anti-ship launchers for the first time, and
more ammunition for high-tech, medium-range rocket launchers, the Biden
administration announced Wednesday.

The U.S. aid will include two Harpoon launchers and an unspecified
number of Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System, or GMLRS, rockets for
previously committed M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or
HIMARS, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced in Brussels. Also
included are 18 M777 howitzers, 36,000 rounds of 155mm ammunition and
thousands of secure radios.

Amid calls from Washington and Kyiv for more and faster shipments of
weapons for Ukrainian forces, Austin and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman
of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged Russia's military
superiority and defended U.S. and allied efforts to even the odds. With
Ukrainian forces facing a tough fight for Eastern Ukraine, the U.S. has
been sending arms meant to take out positions from which Russian forces
launch brutal artillery barrages.

"When you're in the fight, you can never get enough, and you can never
get it quick enough," Austin said at a press conference with Milley.
"But having said all that, we're going to work hard to make sure we're
doing everything humanly possible ― we're going to continue to move
heaven and earth to get them the capability that they need."

The new U.S. aid uses a combination of \$350 million in presidential
authority to draw equipment from U.S. military stocks and \$650 million
in the separate Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. Defense
officials say the Pentagon plans to use USAI to buy truck-mounted
Harpoon launchers, which the U.S. doesn't operate, but the missiles
themselves would come from allies and partners. Denmark previously
committed to providing Harpoons to Ukraine.

Austin hosted a meeting of about 50 nations at NATO headquarters in
Brussels to discuss the weapons deliveries to the invaded nation.
Afterward, he highlighted three multiple-launch rocket systems and GMLRS
ammunition for Ukraine from Germany, Mi-series helicopters and rockets
from Slovakia and artillery donations from Canada, Poland and the
Netherlands.

Though Russia has more artillery, it's using it for mass fires and isn't
necessarily hitting military targets, as Ukrainian forces are, Milley
said. He argued Russia's slow-moving gains in the nearly four-month war
don't mean its victory in Eastern Ukraine is inevitable.

"War takes many, many turns, so I wouldn't say it's an inevitability,
but I would say the numbers do favor the Russians. In terms of
artillery, they do outnumber, they outgun and outrange \... and they do
have enough forces," Milley said. "But the Russians have run into a lot
of problems. They've got command and control issues, logistics issues,
morale issues and leadership issues."

The administration pledged June 1 it would send the HIMARS, with GMLRS
rockets that have a range of about 40 miles. Milley said Wednesday that
by the end of the month, the U.S. will have supplied the systems and
trained Ukrainian crews to operate and maintain them.

Within weeks, Ukrainian forces will have 10 multiple launch rocket
systems from U.S., UK, and Germany, with more than 100 rounds of
ammunition. "They're top notch gunners, and the effect that they're
achieving on the battlefield right now with the \[M777s\] has been very,
very good, very effective ― and we expect the same out of the HIMARS,"
Milley said.

U.S. President Joe Biden announced the aid Wednesday after he held a
call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The U.S. is also
sending \$225 million in humanitarian assistance, including medical
supplies, food, shelter, and cash for families to purchase essential
items.

"The bravery, resilience, and determination of the Ukrainian people
continues to inspire the world. And the United States, together with our
allies and partners, will not waver in our commitment to the Ukrainian
people as they fight for their freedom," Biden said.

Noting "painful" losses in Severodonetsk, which he said would be the key
to controlling the Donbas region, Zelenskyy pleaded anew with the West
for more and faster deliveries of arms in a statement Tuesday. Ukraine
needs "modern anti-missile weapons," he said, adding that its air
defense units had shot down "some" Russian missiles fired at Ukrainian
cities.

"Even though Russia has fewer and fewer modern missiles with each
passing day, Ukraine's need for such systems remains," Zelenskyy said

Republicans and Democrats in Congress have criticized the Biden
administration directly in recent days, urging it to do more.

House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, D-Wash., said he's
told the administration "near constantly" that it's been overly timid
about sending Ukraine sophisticated systems like long-range artillery
and the Grey Eagle, a reusable flying drone with a 200-mile range that
is used by the U.S. Army.

"I think we need to be giving more sophisticated systems, particularly
when it comes to drones and long-range artillery," Smith said Wednesday
at a wide-ranging reporters' roundtable ahead of the administration's
announcement. "I think we ought to get them that equipment more
quickly."

The administration's been "too cautious" as it considers the risks of
exposing U.S. technology and how long it will take to train Ukrainian
troops, Smith added.

The U.S. has sent Ukrainian forces the Puma flying drone and Switchblade
loitering munition as well as the Phoenix Ghost, a new drone developed
by the U.S. Air Force.

Ukraine promised the U.S. it would not strike deep into Russian
territory as part of the deal to acquire HIMARS ― a step meant to avoid
escalating the war.

But Smith said he disagrees with Biden's decision not to supply Ukraine
with longer-range rockets that can reach into Russia and that the U.S.
should be sending even more artillery and ammunition to help Ukraine
stand up to Russia's superior weaponry.

"Quantity is a huge part of the issue right now," Smith said.

Amid such criticism, Pentagon policy chief Colin Kahl said Tuesday the
U.S. intends to continue to send Ukraine what it needs and that the
powerful, precision GMLRS ammunition allows Ukrainian forces to get more
impact for a single shot.

"Think of this more like the effect of an airstrike than launching off
full salvos," Kahl said at a Center for a New American Security event.
"In other words, you can do a lot for a little or you don't need a lot
to have a significant effect."

Overall, the U.S. has committed about \$4.6 billion in security
assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the Biden administration,
including \$3.9 billion since Russia invaded.

The Pentagon has pivoted to supplying Ukraine with western weapons like
the M777 howitzer or truck-mounted HIMARS as stocks from former Warsaw
Pact countries that match Ukraine's Soviet-era weapons have run out,
Kahl said.

He downplayed reports of Russia's progress, saying both Russian and
Ukrainian forces are taking "significant casualties." Still, Kahl said
Russian President Vladimir Putin, after failing to take Kyiv in the
war's early days, continues to want to take over Ukraine completely.

"Our sense is that he has not changed his overall objectives," Kahl
said. "He has designs on a significant portion of Ukraine, if not the
whole country. That said, I do not think he can achieve those
objectives."

### AT: Ukraine Support Inev\-\--2NC

#### Support is not inevitable

Dan **Sabbagh 6/12**, Guardian\'s defence and security editor. \"Ukraine
fears western support will fade as media loses interest in the war\"
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/12/ukraine-fears-western-support-will-fade-as-media-loses-interest-in-the-war>
//pipk

[Ukraine's war with Russia is heading towards its fifth month amid
increasing local concern that dwindling media attention could lead to a
gradual loss of western support just as Moscow is making slow but steady
gains on the frontline]{.underline}.

The anxiety reflects a growing normalisation of the conflict in which
large parts of the country feel distant from the war in eastern Donbas
-- as it becomes clear that casualties are mounting and economic costs
soaring. "[It's a very real threat, that people get tired
psychologically]{.underline}," said Lesia Vasylenko, an opposition MP
with the liberal Holos party.

[International media coverage has dropped markedly in the past two
months, she added, and "as that number goes down further, there's a very
high risk of the support from the west going down".]{.underline}

[Ukraine has become increasingly dependent on western help as the war
has continued, both in terms of weaponry and humanitarian support, and
will need international aid money to help rebuild towns and cities
destroyed by the Russians in the early phase of fighting. Its treasury
is bare]{.underline}.

Russia, meanwhile, appears close to taking the shattered Donbas city of
Sievierodonetsk, after a failed counterattack by Ukraine's forces.

After weeks of silence about casualties, key Ukrainian presidential
advisers have admitted in the past week that as many as 150 are being
killed in fighting every day and 800 wounded.

**[Weapons supply remains top of the list of Ukraine's
demands]{.underline}**. This week [Kyiv]{.underline} admitted it [had
all but run out of Soviet-standard stocks. There is frustration with the
pace of supply]{.underline}, and criticism of President Volodymyr
Zelenskiy's government for not devolving operational decision making
further down the chain.

Two military commanders, who asked not to be named, told the Observer
that for all the president's international achievements, not enough had
been done to tackle the military's post-communist bureaucracy, and that
supplies of some key equipment, such as encrypted battlefield radio,
were short.

Complaints include a lack of practical unit-level information-sharing
with the west or points of contact to help with weapons training. There
is also an absence of ways to find out what equipment might be
available, and a need for practical help with the logistics transfer
from munitions hubs in south-east Poland.

They even wondered if there was a relative lack of urgency on the part
of the country's leaders. "It would be better if Kyiv was under threat,"
murmured one, arguing that some of the pace had gone out of the war
effort once it was clear the Russian assault on the capital had failed
in April.

A missile attack on a railway yard in a distant eastern suburb last
Sunday was the first strike on the city for over five weeks. Air raid
sirens go off periodically but nobody in the relatively busy capital
reacts. Danger seldom follows -- and there is a fatalism that, if a
missile does strike, nothing much could be done about it.

Scratch the surface, and the story is very different. An estimated 7
million Ukrainians are internally displaced, according to the UN, and
while many people have lost loved ones, the city is also full of
everyday stories like Yana's, an IT worker whose house near the border
east of Kharkiv was overrun by Russian soldiers on the first day of the
war.

It took the 31-year-old and her mother until this week to get back to
Kyiv, where they can stay with an aunt, first via her brother's in St
Petersburg, Russia, and then, when they were confident "there would be
something to return to", back to their homeland via Estonia. But their
house remains in occupied territory and it is unclear what condition it
is in.

There are more ominous reports about the situation in the occupied
territories, where Russia has been trying to issue passports and where
this week some officials in Zaporizhzhia were indicating there were
plans to hold referendums on whether the territory should join Russia

Tamila Tasheva, permanent representative of the president of Ukraine for
occupied Crimea, has also been monitoring the situation in neighbouring
Kherson, taken by Russian forces in the first days of the war. She
believes there have been 600 cases of imprisonment and torture in
Kherson province since the war began, and "maybe one or two million
people deported" from Ukraine to Russia by the invaders.

[Those closer to the president are more philosophical about waning media
attention -- **as long as western politicians do not lose focus, and
unity among Nato allies remains** relatively **strong**.]{.underline}

Oleksiy Arestovych, [a high-profile military adviser to the president's
office, said media fatigue was unavoidable as the conflict drew
on]{.underline}. "It was inevitable that the Johnny Depp/Amber Heard
trial garnered more views and likes than the war. [People are getting
weary and tired, but we couldn't care less. You don't have to talk about
us at all. Just give us the weapons]{.underline}," he told the Observer.

But there was a real sense of relief in Kyiv circles that Boris Johnson
survived Monday's no-confidence vote. Zelenskiy said that victory was
"great news" on Tuesday.

The president looked obviously pleased on Friday as he greeted Ben
Wallace, the defence secretary, on his surprise visit. Wallace was there
to discuss how the UK "will continue to meet Ukraine's needs as the
conflict enters a different phase", the Ministry of Defence said.

"The thing that Ukrainians dreaded most was the possibility of the
no-confidence vote for Boris Johnson leading to a change of government,"
added Vasylenko, who has an informal role as a link to British
politicians. "Any change of government means time for reshuffling and
attention away from Ukraine," added the MP, who is due to travel to the
UK next week.

[Ukraine's military tactic seems to amount to fighting hard and taking
high casualties to slow down the Russian attempt to capture
Sievierodonetsk and the rest of the Donbas region while hoping that
newly promised western weapons]{.underline} -- such as multiple rocket
launchers from the US and UK -- [will allow its embattled forces to take
back territory lost to the invaders]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, there is particular frustration with Germany for being slow
on weapons supply and France for appearing to be more willing to engage
with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Arestovych focused on Germany,
where six weeks after the Bundestag voted overwhelmingly to send heavy
weapons to Ukraine, nothing has been received. Howitzers are expected
later this month and Gepard mobile artillery in July.

[The anxiety is that slow supply is preventing Ukraine from
winning.]{.underline} "If we had all the weapons the Germans had been
talking about, we would have kicked out the Russians, Kherson would have
been liberated," Arestovych said -- before going on to describe Olaf
Scholz's government as "disgraceful" and accusing the chancellor of
trying to engage in a flawed balancing act aimed at not hurting the
Russians excessively.

### DSCA Effective Now\-\--2NC

#### DSCA is effective now but is facing a post-COVID spike in demand. Gradual reforms are in progress but the overall process is currently efficient 

Colin **Clark 22**, founding editor of Breaking Defense, also started

DSCA director eschews big changes; 'continuous reform' instead\"
Feburary 16.
<https://breakingdefense.com/2022/02/exclusive-new-dsca-director-eschews-big-reforms-continuous-reform-instead/>
//pipk

In his first interview, [the new director of the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency said he plans to pursue incremental and targeted
improvements to the agency's primary responsibility of coordinating the
export of American weapons]{.underline}.

America's defense industry, along with the allies and partners who buy
US made weapons, have complained for decades that the US government
moves too slowly in approving sales and implementing policies. The State
Department has primary responsibility for approving arms exports, with
DSCA, a Pentagon agency, having oversight once a deal has been approved.

It has become almost a ritual for the head of DSCA to announce a review
of the agency's policies and the laws governing them or to commit to a
wholesale reform effort to "fix" things. But despite a major focus on
defense export reforms under both the Obama and Trump administrations,
it's not clear how much things have actually improved; two senior
defense company executives said here they still believe DSCA moves too
slowly in approving sales.

But the new DSCA director, Jim Hursch, wants to take a different tack.

"So, you know, there have been many reform efforts for military sales
over the last 20 to 30 years. And in each case, you know, usually
marginal improvements are made; some things get better. But I don't see
it worthwhile to expend a huge amount of energy in the short term on a
full-scale review," Hursch told Breaking Defense on Tuesday.

"What I think we need to do is continuous product improvement or process
improvement, and look for ways as we go along to either do things
better, or find new approaches, rather than doing a full-scale reform
review that stops everything, takes a huge amount of time and effort
away from other things," Hursch said. "The fact is that **[most of our
processes]{.underline}**, particularly in the Foreign Military Sales
cases, I think **[work extremely well]{.underline}**."

He said that most of what he hears when comes to events like the
Singapore Air Show is that a country will tell him they have a problem
with a particular arms export case. [The cases that really get hung up
rarely are caught in the DSCA process]{.underline}. Instead, he says,
"they're either foreign policy or they're technology security policy
questions. Neither of those are easy answers, and neither of them will
always get solved."

What has struck Hursch since he took the post six weeks ago?

"So, I think the first thing I'd say, is that [I've been very impressed
with the]{.underline} agency and [security cooperation workforce that we
have]{.underline}. There are improvements we can make. We need to think
about how we better train and prepare folks for these jobs," he said.

"I don't think it's anything that will be, you know, sort of a big
surprise to anybody, but I do think that one thing that continues to be
an issue that we need to attack from my time when I was director of DTSA
\[Defense Technology Security Administration\] 10 years ago is, that I
think [we need to continue to work to make sure that our]{.underline}
technology security and disclosure [processes are working as efficiently
as possible]{.underline}."

[In 2021, DSCA oversaw more than 15,000 FMS cases worth more than half a
trillion dollars, and finalized over \$35 billion in FMS sales, a
decline from 2020's]{.underline} almost \$45 billion in cases. But
Hursch noted that [the three-year "rolling average" of such sales is
\$47 billion. Because single sales can cause huge spikes from year to
year, DSCA has long focused on a multi-year average as opposed to
tracking annually.]{.underline}

Hursch thinks [the pandemic played a significant role in slowing sales.
"Last year was based on COVID impacts that were happening around the
world. So other countries perhaps didn't get as far in their own
processes.]{.underline} Several countries were looking to make sure they
were taking care of health care issues at home and may have moved their
budgets in that direction," he said.

"And, I think, **[as we come out of the pandemic, and especially given
recent developments in the world, I think we will continue to see
relatively high amount of sales. And I think the other thing that needs
to be noted is that, you know, American products continue to be the best
products in the world]{.underline}**."

### DSCA key to Ukraine\-\--2NC

#### Defense Security Cooperation Agency key to Ukrainian arms transfers but they're on the brink of overstretch now. Worsening performance risks transfers and triggers Congressional cuts due to lack of oversight 

Valerie **Insinna 7/1,** "DoD agency wants to put weapons monitors on
the ground in Ukraine"
<https://breakingdefense.com/2022/07/dod-agency-wants-to-put-weapons-monitors-on-the-ground-in-ukraine/>
//pipk

[[The Defense Department]{.mark} agency responsible for overseeing
foreign arms sales [would like to have a presence on the ground to
monitor]{.mark} the use of [US weapons in Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline},
but when that will happen is still unclear, its deputy director said
Thursday.

"We do think that [[over time, we would like to]{.mark} be able to
[extend]{.mark} our insights with a greater [presence]{.mark} on the
ground going forward]{.underline}," Jed Royal, deputy director of the
Defense Security Cooperation Agency, told reporters during a roundtable.

During peacetime, DSCA sends personnel to a foreign nation to open
warehouses and arms bunkers to examine equipment and check the serial
numbers of high-value weapon systems, Royal said. "Right now, in
Ukraine, that's just not available to us as a tool."

**[[Currently, DSCA has personnel]{.mark} stationed [in Europe that
work]{.mark} directly [with Ukrainians on arms
transfers]{.mark}]{.underline}** [occurring outside of
Ukraine]{.underline}, using paper receipts to track weapons as they move
down echelon. [[**However**, those officials are]{.mark} "somewhat
[**limited**" in their ability to do more]{.mark} robust
[monitoring]{.mark} of US made weapons]{.underline}, Royal said.

"[[Once we have more people]{.mark} in country, we should be in a
position to actually go do more]{.underline} physical [validation
\[and\] verification, going forward]{.underline}," he said. "[[That's
the]{.mark} kind of [thing]{.mark} that [we're looking for]{.mark}
here]{.underline}. It still won't be like a peacetime environment for
it. So we're going to have to get creative in how we do this."

Royal added that **[[the agency]{.underline}]{.mark}** is not looking to
send an "operational detachment," but [eventually **[hopes to have a
security cooperation office in Ukraine]{.mark}** similar to those DSCA
has based in other countries]{.underline}.

"[I wouldn't venture]{.underline} \[to guess\] in terms of [when we will
be able to do that]{.underline} or what the what the operational status
might be, or the threat environment might be in Ukraine \[when we do
that\]," he said, adding that [the decision would not be made internally
by DSCA but would fall to more senior government officials]{.underline}.

[Until then, the assurances DSCA officials have received from the
Ukrainians are "very robust and satisfactory," he said]{.underline}.

[**[Getting weapons from American stockpiles to Ukrainian forces
involves]{.mark}** several US agencies, with **[DSCA]{.mark}**
responsible for **[coming up with options of US gear that can meet
Ukraine's requirements]{.mark}**, **[conducting the necessary security
reviews, and pushing]{.mark} those proposal to senior [government
leaders, who]{.mark} ultimately [make the decision on which arms to
send]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

The United States has delivered more than \$6 billion in arms to Ukraine
since Russia invaded in February. [[On Thursday]{.mark}, President Joe
[Biden said]{.mark} that [the US would announce another package]{.mark}
worth \$800 million [in the coming days, which would include
"advanced]{.mark} Western [air defense]{.mark} system for Ukraine, more
[artillery]{.mark} and [ammunition, counter-battery radars]{.mark},
additional [ammunition for]{.mark} the [HIMARS multiple launch rocket
system we've already given Ukraine and more HIMARS coming from other
countries as well,"]{.mark} he said.]{.underline}

**[[While Congress has been broadly supportive of security assistance to

### SC key to Ukraine\-\--2NC

#### Assistance to Ukraine is key to them winning

David **Leonhardt 7/6,** senior writer for The New York Times. \"Three
War Scenarios\"
<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/06/briefing/ukraine-war-three-scenarios.html>
//pipk

Avril Haines, the U.S. director of national intelligence, recently
outlined [three plausible scenarios in Ukraine]{.underline}.

In the first, [Russia's continuing progress in eastern Ukraine would
break Ukrainians' will to fight and allow the Russian military to take
over even more of the country. This outcome is Vladimir Putin's new goal
after being defeated in his initial attempt to oust Ukraine's
government]{.underline}.

[In the second scenario]{.underline} --- [the most likely
one]{.underline}, Haines said (during a public appearance in Washington
last week) --- [Russia would dominate the east but would not be able to
go much farther. The two countries would fall into a stalemate that
Haines described as "a grinding struggle."]{.underline}

[In the third scenario, Ukraine would halt Russia's advance in the east
and also succeed in launching counterattacks. Ukraine has already
regained some territory, especially in the southern part of the country,
and some military experts expect a broader offensive soon]{.underline}.

Today's newsletter provides an update on the war by examining a few
questions that will help determine which of these three scenarios
becomes most likely.

Temporary or permanent

[Has the tide definitively turned or are Ukrainian forces about to have
more success]{.underline}?

**[The most recent phase of the war has gone well for
Russia]{.underline}**. The eastern part of Ukraine, known as the
[Donbas]{.underline} region, [has two provinces]{.underline} ---
[Luhansk and Donetsk]{.underline}. **[Russia now controls virtually all
of Luhansk and about 60 percent of Donetsk]{.underline}**, according to
Thomas Bullock, an analyst for Janes, a company specializing in
intelligence issues.

[Yesterday, Russian forces increased their shelling near Bakhmut, a city
in Donetsk that's an important Ukrainian supply hub. Russia used a
similar tactic in Luhansk to clear Ukrainian forces and civilians before
taking over cities]{.underline}.

"[The Kremlin is sending the message that their overall plans haven't
changed and that everything is going according to plan]{.underline},"
Anton Troianovski, The Times's Moscow bureau chief, said. [In a sign of
confidence in the Kremlin, Russian media have recently been reporting
plans for holding referendums in the captured territories and formally
annexing them, Anton added]{.underline}.

**[But Ukraine does continue to benefit from an influx of sophisticated
weapons from the West. And there is some reason to wonder whether
Ukrainian troops will soon be able to make better use of those weapons
than they have so far]{.underline}**.

In the initial phase of the war, the [U.S., E.U. and other Ukrainian
allies were sending relatively simple weapons, like the shoulder-fired
missile systems known as Javelins. Those weapons helped Ukraine defend
territory from small groups of Russian forces. More recently, the West
has sent more powerful artillery --- like the HIMARS, a truck-based
rocket system --- meant to help Ukraine withstand the massive buildup of
Russian troops in the east]{.underline}.

[Training somebody to use a Javelin can take just a few hours, my
colleague Julian Barnes points out. Training troops to use a HIMARS can
take days or weeks --- as does transporting them to the battlefield. In
coming weeks, Julian said he would be watching to see whether Ukraine
would be able to use its growing supply of HIMARS to inflict more damage
on Russian troops]{.underline}.

(Here's more on the early effect of the HIMARS from Eric Schmitt and
John Ismay of The Times.)

No Russian draft

[Is Russia running out of troops]{.underline}?

[Two recent developments have offered reason to wonder. First, Russia
has had to turn to outside troops]{.underline} --- [like those from the
Wagner Group, a private company]{.underline} --- [to replenish their
units]{.underline}, as my colleague Thomas Gibbons-Neff explained in his
recent analysis of the war. [Second, Putin ordered some of the troops
involved in recent victories in the Donbas region to rest, suggesting
that those units were exhausted]{.underline}.

"American officials and outside analysts both agree [if Russia wants to
move beyond the Donbas, they will need to take a step they have been
unwilling to do: a mass mobilization]{.underline}," Julian said.
"[Russia will need to conduct a military draft, recall soldiers who
previously served and take politically painful steps to rebuild their
force. So far, Putin has been unwilling to do so."]{.underline}

[Russia has many more resources than Ukraine, including soldiers and
weapons. But Russia's resources do have limits, especially if Putin is
unwilling to spend political capital on a mass
mobilization.]{.underline}

[These limits raise the prospect that Ukraine can hold Russia's gains to
the east and slowly exhaust Russian troops with counterattacks and
internal resistance --- as well as Western economic sanctions. **That
situation, in turn, could lead Putin to accept an eventual cease-fire
that leaves most of Ukraine intact**]{.underline}.

"**[That will not be a perfect victory," Julian said, "but it might be
realistic]{.underline}**."

Shell shock

**[But is Ukraine running out of troops even faster]{.underline}**?

[Both sides appear to be suffering a similarly high rate of casualties
--- hundreds per day. As a result, Ukraine has had to rely increasingly
on troops with little training]{.underline}.

The surviving troops are also at risk of psychological damage. [The
method of fighting in the east --- an unceasing exchange of artillery

#### US arms are key to Ukraine winning

Eric **Schmitt &** John **Ismay 7/1**, New York Times reporters.
\"Advanced U.S. Arms Make a Mark in Ukraine War, Officials Say\"
<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/01/us/politics/himars-weapons-ukraine.html>
//pipk

The most advanced weapons that the United States has so far supplied
Ukraine are making an impact in their first several days on the
battlefield, destroying Russian ammunition depots and command centers,
American and Ukrainian officials say.

Ukraine's military had eagerly awaited the arrival of the first batch of
truck-mounted, multiple-rocket launchers, whose satellite-guided rockets
have a range of more than 40 miles, greater than anything Ukraine had
possessed. The weapons have even won grudging respect from some Russians
for their accuracy and power, analysts said.

Still, only four of the launchers, called High Mobility Artillery Rocket
Systems or HIMARS, and their U.S.-trained crews are in the fight, though
four more are expected this month. Ukrainian officials say they need as
many as 300 multiple-rocket launchers to combat Russia, which is firing
several times as many rounds as Ukraine's forces in the artillery-driven
war of attrition in the country's east.

Ukrainian soldiers are using their new weapon judiciously, firing one or
two guided rockets at ammunition depots or command posts, often at
night, and keeping them well away from the front lines to protect them,
Pentagon officials and military analysts say.

"So far they seem to be a quite useful addition," Rob Lee, a Russian
military specialist at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in
Philadelphia and a former U.S. Marine officer, said of the systems.
"They will help hinder further Russian advances, but they won't
necessarily mean Ukraine will be able to take back territory."

The HIMARS are the centerpiece of a raft of new Western long-range
weapons that the outgunned Ukrainian military is switching over to as
its arsenal of Soviet-era howitzer and rocket ammunition dwindles.

The Western weapons are more accurate and highly mobile, but it takes
weeks to deploy them from the United States and Europe and to train
soldiers to use them. In the meantime, Russia's military is making slow
but methodical gains in the eastern region of Donbas, where both sides
have taken heavy losses.

The Biden administration says that all eight HIMARS should be in Ukraine
by mid-July. The first group of 60 Ukrainian soldiers trained to use
them are now firing the guided rockets in battle, and a second group is
undergoing training in Germany. Britain and Germany have each pledged
three similar multiple-rocket launchers.

A senior Pentagon official said this week that the Ukrainians appear to
be employing the HIMARS with deadly effectiveness and that the four
additional systems would be deployed in "the near future."

At a NATO summit in Madrid on Thursday, President Biden promised \$800
million more in security assistance to Ukraine, including more
ammunition for the HIMARS. The United States has committed nearly \$7
billion in military aid since the war started in February.

Since Russia focused its campaign on the east after failing to seize
Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, and other cities in the north, Ukrainian
officials have pleaded with the United States and other allies for more
advanced artillery.

On June 23, Ukraine's defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, announced that
the first American HIMARS had arrived, promising in a Twitter message,
"Summer will be hot for russian occupiers. And the last one for some of
them."

Two days later, Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the top commander of Ukrainian
forces, posted a video on the social media site Telegram of the HIMARS
in use. "Artillerymen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine skillfully hit
certain targets --- the enemyʼs military facilities on our Ukrainian
territory," he said.

American officials said the Ukrainian statements were accurate, and Mr.
Lee added that even Russian accounts acknowledged the HIMARS to be early
successes.

"In general, it seems they respect them and realize they're quite
capable," said Mr. Lee, citing a popular Russian Telegram channel whose
posts are shared by Russian defense accounts.

At G20 summit, Beijing's support for Russia will likely be focus of a
meeting between U.S. and China.

Zelensky calls Johnson 'a true friend' to Ukraine.

U.S. senators in Kyiv say they will push to send more arms to Ukraine.

There is still a debate as to how many multiple-rocket launchers Ukraine
needs.

Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky of
Ukraine, said in June that Ukraine needed 300 multiple-launch rocket
systems and 500 tanks, among other things, to achieve battlefield parity
--- several times as much heavy weaponry as has been promised.

Michael G. Vickers, the Pentagon's former top civilian official for
counterinsurgency strategy, said the Ukrainians needed at least 60, and
perhaps as many as 100, HIMARS or other multiple-launch rocket systems
to win the artillery battle.

"There are plenty available that could be supplied at minimal strategic
risk," said Mr. Vickers, who was the principal C.I.A. strategist for
arming anti-Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the mid-1980s.

Mr. Lee noted that future success of the HIMARS and other
multiple-rocket launchers depended not only on the number sent, but also
on how much and what type of ammunition the United States and other
allies provided.

The transition to American-made rocket weapons was forced in part by the
supply problems the Ukrainian army has faced.

Ukraine has three types of Russian-made mobile rocket launchers, but
ammunition for only the one with the shortest range is produced by its
allies. Ammunition for Ukraine's longer-range artillery rockets is made
solely by Russia and Belarus.

For the HIMARS, Ukrainian forces rely on a guided rocket that is aided
by GPS signals and accurate to within about 30 feet of its intended
target. Before launch, a three-person crew inputs coordinates for each
strike.

After a NATO meeting in Brussels on June 15, Defense Secretary Lloyd J.
Austin III said that the guided rockets, fired by both the new
American-provided launchers that can carry one pack of six rockets and
the launchers from Britain and Germany that can carry twice that, were
far more capable than Russian-made artillery rocket weapons that have
been used on the battlefield.

"These are precision munitions, and with a properly trained crew they
will hit what they're aiming at," Mr. Austin said. "Over time, we think
the combination of what the allies and partners can bring to the table,
it will make a difference."

Besides firing long-range guided munitions, the wheeled HIMARS trucks
have the advantage of speed. Not only can they drive quickly to a firing
point, they can program targets while en route, launch their rockets
singly or in a ripple of all six within a minute, and reload far faster
than anything in use by the Russians.

With 200 pounds of high explosives in each rocket, a HIMARS salvo can
rival the devastating effect of an airstrike from a jet loaded with
precision-guided bombs.

Following Mr. Austin's remarks at NATO, Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, hinted at the effect HIMARS could have in
Ukrainian hands.

"If they use the weapon properly," General Milley said, "they ought to
be able to take out a significant amount of targets."

### Agent Link\-\--2NC

#### Only fiating one agency results in stove-piped implementation that hurts partnerships necessary for security cooperation

Bilal Y. **Saab 19**, Senior Fellow and Director of the Defense and
Security Program. In addition, he is an Adjunct Assistant Professor at
Georgetown University's Security Studies Program in the School of
Foreign Service. Saab served as Senior Advisor for Security Cooperation
(SC) in the Pentagon's Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for
Policy, with oversight responsibilities for U.S. Central Command
(CENTCOM). In his capacity as the Department of Defense's lead on
security cooperation in the broader Middle East, Saab supported the
Under Secretary of Defense for Policy's responsibility for SC oversight
by leading prioritization and strategic integration of SC resources and

//pipk

It is convenient, and in many cases justifiable, to assign blame to US
partners for the deficiencies of security cooperation, including their
hesitancy to take on more responsibilities and their failure to spend
more on defense to improve military capabilities. But the unpopular
truth is that [a major ailment of security cooperation is internal to
the United States. This sizeable and exponentially growing enterprise is
malfunctioning because the US national security bureaucracy has been in
great disorder since the end of the Cold War. If foreign policy starts
at home, so does security cooperation]{.underline}.

**[The key actors involved in security
cooperation]{.underline}**---**[the White House, Congress, Department of
Defense, and Department of State]{.underline}**---**[do not have a
unified understanding of security cooperation:]{.underline}** [what it's
supposed to achieve, how to use and improve it, and how to tell if it's
working]{.underline}. Moreover, **[they have failed to coordinate their
efforts on various matters including oversight and
accountability]{.underline}**. [**Security cooperation relies on
bureaucratic partnerships**. Yet, these partnerships are broken, and the
enterprise is awfully **stove-piped** as a result of anemic
leadership.]{.underline}

### DOS Link\-\--2NC

#### State Department magnifies the link. Forces a trade-off with other priorities and generates jurisdictional conflicts with Defense

//pipk

Moreover, [executive branch departments and agencies]{.underline} lack a
common set of regional and country-specific Security Cooperation
objectives and [do not operate according to the same set of
priorities]{.underline}. For example, [State and Defense are two of the
most significant players in Security Cooperation]{.underline}. [DOS
controls Security Assistance]{.underline} \-- including Foreign Military
Financing (FMF) and the International Military Education and Training
(IMET) program, [the largest sources of funds DOD uses to execute its
Security Cooperation activities. DOS requests funds from Congress and
allocates resources to DOD based on its own assessment of foreign policy
requirements, which do not always agree with DOD's]{.underline}. OSD
carefully lays out the strategic rationale for its Security Cooperation
plans in its Security Cooperation guidance, but DOS officials are free
to ignore or accept the contents of this guidance as they like.119
Likewise, [DOD and its subordinate organizations painstakingly
prioritize countries and regions to guide allocation of Security
Cooperation resources, but the Department of State has its own
priorities, which do not always coincide.]{.underline}120

The lack of baseline strategic guidance to govern the planning,
programming, and execution of Security Cooperation activities has
resulted in the classic failures of an "administered policy." According
to Barry Posen, [administered policies prevail in democracies as
political leaders]{.underline} **[trade off]{.underline}** [initiatives
that might be effective in one area against costs measured in terms of
other agendas, values, and policies]{.underline}.121 [The result is
bureaucratic politics and competition for resources and policy
attention]{.underline}. To avoid the pitfalls of an administered policy
the USG must develop a combined approach that brings together all the
stakeholders, assigns responsibilities, and requires integrated
planning.122 A document or set of documents, under the signature of the
President or the National Security Council will be required to provide
sufficient authority to require and compel interagency cooperation in
crafting and [[implementing]{.underline}]{.mark} integrated [[Security
Cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} strategies.

as much as [SCO personnel]{.underline} have to cope with cultural
differences in adapting to the host nation, they [must]{.underline} also
[adjust to the very different institutional cultures within various U.S.
government agencies]{.underline}. 7

According to Dr. Sweet, [SCO personnel are most effective when they keep
the mission\'s overall strategic objectives at the forefront,
recognizing that each agency brings its own strengths (and blind spots)
to the table. Once identified, these strengths can be
amplified]{.underline} \-- and relative weaknesses mitigated \-- [by
working together as a cohesive team in service of the mission\'s
goals]{.underline}. 8 This is, in effect, the interagency version of the
DoD\'s \"one team, one mission\" principle. On the other hand,
**[interagency squabbling and turf wars can hinder the ability to
accomplish the greater U.S. mission in the host nation]{.underline}**.
When there is cohesion, working with DoS can be one the most rewarding
parts of working at a SCO, both personally and professionally \--
something Dr. Sweet states is also true for State Department personnel

It is up to the SCO to understand the DoD components\' positions and
true needs, comprehend the host nation position, communicate with all
parties involved and facilitate resolution. To do this, **[it is
essential for the SCO to have a full sight picture of all DoD happenings
in the host nation. Only then can the SCO effectively liaise with the
host nation and advise the Ambassador and GCC]{.underline}**. A solution
to complex multi-component challenges is usually workable as long as the
parties have a strong working relationship and communication is open,
regular and honest.

[This is important not only for solving immediate issues, but for
**preserving host nation good will for long term strategic
interests**]{.underline}. Consider, for example, how [the above scenario
could degenerate into crisis if the Army, Air Force and Navy were
**independently engaging the host nation**]{.underline} (**[i.e., not

\"Office of Military Cooperation\" is only one term for [[a Security

org]{.mark}anization permanently located in a foreign country [with
**responsibilities for carrying out all security cooperation**]{.mark}
**management functions [with the host nation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 1
Depending on political sensitivities within a host nation, a SCO may be
known by any number of names, including Office of Defense Cooperation or
Military Liaison Office. \[\*35\] [[Security cooperation encompasses all
DoD interactions with foreign defense establishments]{.mark} to build
defense relationships that promote specific U.S. security interests,
develop allied and friendly military capabilities for self-defense and
multinational operations, and provide U.S. forces with peacetime and
contingency access to a host nation.\"]{.underline} 2 Put another way,
\"\[security cooperation\] is the means by which DoD encourages and
enables countries and organizations to work with the United States to
achieve strategic objectives.\" 3

A significant portion of a SCO\'s responsibilities include managing and
executing security assistance programs under the Foreign Assistance Act
of 1961, as amended, and the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, as
amended. While the Department of State (DoS) has primary responsibility
for implementing security assistance, many programs are executed by the
DoD, including Foreign Military Sales, Foreign Military Financing and
International Military Education and Training.

[Security cooperation]{.underline}, however, [is not limited to security
assistance, nor is security assistance [a SCO\'s]{.mark} only
responsibility. **As [the principal]{.mark} DoD [link]{.mark} to the
host nation defense establishment,**]{.underline} a [[SCO is responsible
for]{.mark} coordinating various activities such as **military
[exercises]{.mark}**, **basing and storage of** DoD **[personnel and

**[intel]{.mark}ligence [coop]{.mark}eration**, **[logistical
support]{.mark} arrangements, [and transit]{.mark} of military aircraft
and personnel** through the host nation]{.underline}.

[A SCO is usually located at or near the U.S. Embassy in the host nation
and is headed by the Senior Defense Official/Defense
Attaché]{.underline} (SDO/DATT). [The SDO/ DATT serves [under]{.mark}
the direction of [the Ambassador]{.mark}, also known as the Chief of
Mission, [with]{.mark} joint [oversight by the]{.mark}]{.underline}
respective Geographic Combatant Commander ([GCC]{.underline}); the
Director, **[[D]{.mark}efense [S]{.mark}ecurity [C]{.mark}ooperation
[A]{.mark}gency]{.underline}**; and the Director, Defense Intelligence
Agency. 4 The SDO/DATT is a member of the Embassy\'s Country Team and is
the Ambassador\'s principal advisor on defense issues, including
planning, coordinating and supporting U.S. defense activities in the
host nation. 5 In addition, the SDO/DATT liaises with host-nation
defense establishments and represents the Secretary of Defense, GCC, and
the DoD Components to host-nation counterparts and other foreign
diplomats accredited to the host nation. 6 In these various roles, [the
SDO/DATT is responsible for selling U.S. military equipment to the host
nation, helping the host nation defense forces obtain military education
and training, and building and maintaining the U.S.-host nation defense
relationship to secure U.S. present and future interests]{.underline}.

### Turns Russia\-\--2NC

#### European security cooperation is set at a fix amount but has shifted to the EDI to deter Russia

Michael J. **Mazarr et al 22**, senior political scientist at the RAND
Corporation. \"Security Cooperation in a Strategic Competition\"
Research Report. <http://www.rand.org/t/RRA650-1> //pipk

[Security Cooperation Efforts in Europe Emphasize Reassuring U.S.
Allies]{.underline} **[European partners have consistently received
approximately 26 percent of all U.S. security aid, but there has been a
shift since 2014 in the type of aid these partners have
received]{.underline}**. [Specifically, more attention has been devoted
to **developing conventional capabilities to deter Russian
aggression**]{.underline}. [Eastern European states]{.underline} that
border Russia, particularly Ukraine, received \$1.1 billion from 2014 to
2019.18 Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia also [received some
funding through the **European Deterrence Initiative**.]{.underline}
However, of the billions of dollars designated for the initiative, only
a small portion supports building partner capacity. [The initiative was
designed primarily to support U.S. force presence, infrastructure, and
exercises]{.underline}; as a result, DoD does not formally categorize
European Deterrence Initiative funding as security aid.19

Over our period of study, U[.S. military sales have increased for both
highly capable allies and]{.underline} newer North Atlantic Treaty
Organization ([NATO) partners in Europe]{.underline}. Among the top
weapon purchasers, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Germany are purchasing
advanced aircraft, unmanned aerial systems, and missiles through the FMS
and DCS programs. Poland and Romania are acquiring Patriot air-defense
systems, and Slovakia is purchasing F-16 aircraft through FMS.20

[The focus of U.S. education and training efforts in Europe has also
been on conventional military capabilities funded by FMS]{.underline}.
Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Romania, and Poland are the top
recipients of these security cooperation activities.21

Furthermore, [U.S.- and NATO-sponsored exercises in Europe are
increasing in number and size. These exercises, which focus on improving
interoperability for conventional operations]{.underline}, include Saber
Guardian (a U.S.-sponsored exercise with 25,000 service members from 22
allied and partner nations) and Trident Juncture (a NATO-sponsored
exercise with 50,000 participants from NATO and partner countries).22
NATO arrangements [afford the United States a high degree of access in
Europe.]{.underline} Of the 51 countries in the EUCOM AOR, 45 have
multilateral SOFAs through NATO or the Partnership for Peace program,
and there are 126 acquisition and cross-servicing agreements that apply
to the region.23 The majority of USAF armament agreements and airmen in
personnel exchanges are with European countries, and most personnel
exchanges through the USAF's Military Personnel Exchange Program are
with the United Kingdom. Countries in EUCOM's AOR received \$27 million
in Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid support, divided
across several Eastern European states; Ukraine received \$4 million,
the highest amount.

#### Increases in security cooperation forces EDI trade-offs. That undermines deterrence

C. Provide Specific Lines of Funding for EDI Activities As previously
discussed, [one of the problems with EDI as a means to achieving the
United States\' strategic goals in the Baltic States is the lack of
clarity in funding activities. This hampers efforts to plan, program,
budget, and execute activities that could provide meaningful support to
the deterrence effort.]{.underline} 198 Although the DoD submits a line
item budget for EDI funding requests, 199 the FY17 NDAA did not provide
funding authorizations for ERI activities in distinct line items in the
funding tables. 200

[Congress should]{.underline} address this omission to [ensure the
greatest use of EDI funds possible]{.underline}. [Unlike EDI, other
operations]{.underline} funded by OCO funds, such as the Afghanistan
Security Forces Fund (ASFF) and Counter-ISIL Fund, provide specific line
item funding authorizations in the Funding \[\*188\] Tables of the FY17
NDAA. 201 These authorizations [provide the commander with clear limits
and sources of funding]{.underline}. The ASFF provides a single
appropriation with a two-year period of availability to various types of
authorized assistance. 202 **[Accordingly, it is easier to align the
authority with the source of funding available for each security
cooperation activity]{.underline}**.

Using ASFF funding as an example, Congress should simplify the funding
authorization for [EDI activities]{.underline} and earmark funds within
each appropriation. 203 This [will]{.underline} ensure greater ease in
accounting and planning activities consistent with Congress\'s intent to
[deter Russian aggression through support of NATO]{.underline}.
Designating a portion of appropriated funds specifically for EDI will
**[avoid competition between other non-ERI authorities that are funded
with the same money.]{.underline}**

Moreover, separate lines of authority specific to EDI will eliminate
confusion as to what authority EUCOM should use when [multiple
appropriations appear to authorize the use of funds for the same
purpose.]{.underline} [When there are multiple authorizations to use
funds for the same purpose, the agency must elect which appropriation to
use]{.underline}. 204 **[Due to the EDI\'s line of effort focusing on
building capacity of foreign nations\' security forces overlapping with
security cooperation authoritie]{.underline}**s, 205 [there is confusion
as to whether EUCOM can use security cooperation funds in addition to
EDI funds, or whether one authority is the more specific of the two and
must be used exclusively for its purpose]{.underline}. Separate and
specific lines of accounting will at least disentangle funds with common
purposes. To ensure maximum utility of all the fiscal authorities
relevant to defending NATO allies from Russian aggression, Congress
should specifically authorize the use of security cooperation
appropriations provided for \[\*189\] DoD-wide use in addition to EDI
funds for building capacity of the forces in the Baltic States. 206

Founded on 4 April 1949, NATO is an alliance to safeguard freedom and
promote stability in the North Atlantic area through collective defense.
23 Originally twelve members, NATO expanded to twenty-eight, with most
of the expansion occurring after the fall of the Soviet Union. 24
Despite numerous geopolitical shifts since its \[\*153\] inception,
[[NATO is]{.underline}]{.mark} still [**[the \"cornerstone of
transatlantic security cooperation]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the
**guarantor of [peace]{.mark} and stability [in
Europe]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\" 25 Under Article 5 of the North
Atlantic Treaty, NATO members are committed to collective self-defense.
26 Thus, an attack against any NATO member is considered an attack on
all NATO members, whereby, in the exercise of the right to individual or
collective defense under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, each
member will assist the member attacked, including the use of armed
force, to \"restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic
area.\" 27

Although Article 5 was not triggered when Russia invaded Crimea because
Ukraine is not a NATO member, [[the prospect of a Russian attack]{.mark}
on a NATO member, such as Estonia or Latvia, [reinvigorated]{.mark} the
concept of [collective self-defense]{.mark} under Article
5]{.underline}. This was invoked only once in the Alliance\'s history
after the terrorists attacks on September 11, 2001. 28 At the 2014 Wales
Summit, [[NATO members agreed to respond to Russia and]{.mark} \"pledged
to stop cuts and [increase defense spending]{.mark} to two percent of
GDP \[Gross Domestic Product\] within a decade,\" leading many NATO
allies to reverse years of defense spending cuts]{.underline}. 29 In
2016, spending cuts stopped across Europe and Canada for the first time
in years and a three percent increase in defense spending is expected.
30 In addition to a pledge to increase defense spending, [[NATO set out
plans]{.mark} to increase readiness and responsiveness [in]{.mark}
Eastern Europe, called [the **Readiness Action Plan**]{.mark}
(RAP).]{.underline} 31 [[The **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates\'
[role]{.mark} in the RAP [became]{.mark} known as [Operation Atlantic
Resolve]{.mark}; [led by]{.mark} the United States European Command
([EUCOM]{.mark}).]{.underline} 32 In 2016, **[both [EUCOM and
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[\*154\] **[significantly [expanded]{.mark}
their [collective efforts to counter Russian aggression by]{.mark}
adding [deterrence-]{.mark}based measures to the mission of Operation
Atlantic Resolve and the RAP]{.underline}**. 33 At the Warsaw Summit in
July 2016, NATO leaders determined the strategy to respond to Russia\'s
growing Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) capability in the Baltics was to
increase its forward presence in the Baltics significantly. 34 The
United States, along with NATO partners Germany, Canada, the United
Kingdom, and France, began the largest buildup of forces in Europe since
the Cold War, adding an armored brigade combat team (ABCT) supported by
air assault forces into seven nations stretching along the eastern flank
of NATO from Estonia to Bulgaria in January 2017. 35

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} Obama [[admin]{.mark}istration
[demonstrated]{.mark} its [intent to]{.mark} shift United States
strategy from \"reassurance\" to \"[deter]{.mark}rence\" as it requested
to quadruple the [funding]{.mark} for [the]{.mark} **E**uropean
**R**eassurance **I**nitiative (**[ERI]{.mark}**) for Fiscal Year
2017.]{.underline} 36 [**In pursuit of a capable deterrent force,**
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [in
its informal role as military leader in NATO, has delineated five lines
of effort: increased rotational presence of air, land, and sea forces;
additional bilateral and multilateral exercises and training to improve
overall readiness and interoperability; prepositioning of U.S. equipment
to enhance rapid response capabilities in Europe; improve infrastructure
to increase flexibility and readiness; and build the capacity of allies
and partners in Central and Eastern Europe.]{.underline} 37

[[Despite]{.mark} the [renewed emphasis on security within]{.mark} the
[Europe]{.mark}an contingent of NATO, [the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [would face a disproportionate burden]{.mark} within
the Alliance, both militarily and financially, if Russia launches an
attack across its western border in order to defend what some may
consider a minor ally in Estonia or Latvia]{.underline}. 38 Although the
Obama administration affirmed the United States\' obligation under
Article 5 to come to the defense of any NATO member, he stated that the
rest of NATO must build its defense capacity to ease the burden on the
United States, leading to doubts among European leaders. 39 President
Donald Trump is even less reassuring than his predecessor was. He has
indicated defense provided by the United States may be \[\*156\]
contingent on a NATO member\'s own defense spending. 40 Additionally, a
\"decade of foreign wars, a devastating global financial crisis,
mounting public debt, and profound realignments in international
political and economic power have inspired calls for fundamental change
from the competing extremes of the American political landscape,\"
towards an isolationist strategy. 41 There are indications of bipartisan
public support for foreign policy retrenchment as well. According to one
poll, fifty-seven percent of Americans think the United States should
deal with its own problems, 42 whereas only forty-four percent of the
American public would support the use of U.S. troops to defend the
Baltic States from a Russian invasion. 43

Nonetheless, **[[the importance of a credible deterrent and swift
response to Russian aggression cannot be
overstated]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If Russia chose to attack a Baltic
state, it will not only test the collective self-defense commitment
under Article 5, it will test the credibility and durability of the
United Nations Charter\'s prohibition of the use of force in other
states. 44 Thus, [NATO\'s response to any future aggression by Russia
within the Alliance\'s territory \"has significant implications for both
NATO and the Charter]{.underline}.\" 45 As such, \"\[t\]he United States
should treat \[the Baltic States\] with the same importance as France,
Germany and the United Kingdom.\" 46

Whatever course of action the Trump administration chooses to take
vis-à-vis Russian aggression in Eastern Europe, it is clear President
Trump will have [[to lead NATO through this potentially catastrophic
situation with Russia while navigating a fiscal maelstrom of overseas
defense spending]{.underline}]{.mark}. Setting up a European response to
a Russian A2/AD environment in the Baltics 47 [[will]{.mark} cost
billions of dollars in planning, movement of troops and assets, and
development of **effective offset strategy**]{.underline}; 48 the United
States must carefully consider any financial assistance it provides. 49

### Taiwan I/L\-\--2NC

#### DSCA key to Taiwan arms sales

Seth **Robson 22**, Starts and Stripes, April 8. \"US approves
air-defense upgrade for Taiwan as COVID-19 nixes reported visit by
Pelosi\" Nexis //pipk

"[The United States has approved a \$95 million military sale to boost
Taiwan\'s air defenses, as China sends increasing numbers of warplanes
near the island democracy.]{.underline}

[Details of a contract]{.underline} to support \"training, planning,
fielding, deployment, operation, maintenance, and sustainment of the
Patriot Air Defense System\" on Taiwan [were released by the **D**efense
**S**ecurity **C**ooperation **A**gency on Tuesday]{.underline}.

Chinese military planes enter Taiwan\'s air defense identification zone
on an almost daily basis, according to data published by Taiwan\'s
Defense Ministry.

In the past few months, 250 Chinese aircraft have entered the island\'s
zone, double the number the same period last year, Japanese broadcaster
NHK reported Thursday. An air defense identification zone, which
typically extends beyond a nation\'s airspace, is an area defined by
that country to control and identify approaching aircraft.

\"This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and security
interests by supporting the recipient\'s continuing efforts to modernize
its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability,\" the
Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in its statement.

Raytheon Technologies, which makes the Patriot system, referred
questions about the sale to the U.S. and Taiwanese governments.

The Communist Party of China considers Taiwan a renegade province that
must ultimately be unified politically with the mainland.

The U.S. continues to help Taiwan maintain sufficient self-defense
capabilities, Taiwan\'s Defense Ministry said in a statement posted on
its website following the U.S. announcement.

\"This arms sale shows that the United States attaches great importance
to \[Taiwan\'s\] national defense and security,\" the statement said.
\"The two sides will continue to consolidate the security partnership
and jointly maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the
Indo-Pacific region.\"

China will take \"firm and robust measures\" to protect its sovereignty
and security interests, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian
told reporters while addressing the sale at a press conference
Wednesday.

U.S. arms sales to Taiwan \"gravely undermine China\'s sovereignty
andâ€‚security interests, and severely harm China-US relations and peace
and stability across the Taiwan Strait,\" he said, according to a
transcript of the press conference. \"China rejects and deplores
this.\"â€‚

The latest upgrade for Taiwan, which received its first Patriots in
1997, shows America\'s commitment to helping nations develop defense
capabilities, the Alexandria, Va.-based Missile Defense Advocacy
Alliance said in a statement Wednesday. The group lobbies for missile
defense, deployment and development.

Meanwhile, a reported visit to Taiwan by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
appears to be postponed. She has tested positive for the coronavirus,
her office said in a statement Thursday.

The speaker\'s deputy communications director, Drew Hammill, tweeted
Friday that a congressional delegation to Asia, which Pelosi was to have
led, \"will be postponed to a later date.\"

Pelosi had planned to visit the island on Sunday after meeting Japanese
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, according to a Friday report citing
unnamed sources by the Fuji News Network.

China would respond with \"resolute and forceful measures\" if Pelosi
were to visit Taiwan, the state-run Global Times newspaper reported
Friday.

The last visit to Taiwan by a House speaker was in 1997 by Newt
Gingrich, said Norah Huang, director for international relations at the
Prospect Foundation, a security and foreign affairs think tank in
Taipei.

\"Pelosi has a long record of speaking up for democracy and human
rights,\" she told Stars and Stripes in an email Friday. \"She helped
young activists involved in the 1989 student movement to leave China and
advocated support for democracies along the way of her career.\"

A visit by the speaker to Taiwan would amplify support for democracy and
opposition to authoritarian regimes and human rights abusers, Huang
said.

This would be especially important \"against the backdrop of the acute
display of atrocity by Russian armed forces in Ukraine, the crack-down
on Hong Kong civilian rights and the growing aggressiveness of \[China\]
in Taiwan Strait,\" she said.

### Democracy Module\-\--2NC

#### Stream-lined security cooperation is key to security relationships that solve innovation and deterrence necessary to defend democracy

R. Clarke **Cooper 21**, nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic
Council, former assistant secretary at the US Department of State, a
former senior intelligence officer for the US Joint Special Operations
Command. December 23. \"A multipolar world requires more adaptive US
security thinking\"
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/a-multipolar-world-requires-more-adaptive-us-security-thinking/>
//pipk

While the scale and volume of military interventions by China, Russia,
and Iran are reportedly lower now than at the height of Cold War, [the
increasing risks of [disruptive actions]{.mark} by]{.underline} these
[state actors and their proxies [in a multipolar world require
deterrence featuring robust tech]{.mark}nological [solutions, which can
only emerge from smart, adaptive policy]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The United States and its security partners are awaiting the
Biden]{.underline} administration's [Global Posture Review]{.underline},
[along with]{.underline} the potential [expansion of security
cooperation procedures]{.underline}, expanded congressional reviews, and
a revision of the Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) Policy---[which would
further protract an already lengthy]{.underline} arms-sale
[process]{.underline}. [Meanwhile, [dictatorial adversaries of
democracy]{.mark} and freedom in Beijing, Moscow, and Tehran [are
aggressively seeking opportunities for disruption wherever Washington
might expand or reduce security cooperation]{.mark}, or simply withdraw
its presence. [Ready access to low-cost, but effective]{.mark},
commercial [tech]{.mark}nologies [render that threat]{.mark} even more
[potent]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**[[For the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to remain a leader]{.mark}
in this new multipolar world [and]{.mark} more [effectively plan its
global posture, it must]{.mark}]{.underline}** snap out of a Cold
War-style mindset, [[cut down on bureaucracy]{.mark}, [and **refrain
from expanding processes that hamstring security
cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Trump administration made some notable advances to promote
innovation and protect US technological advantage through its 2017
National Security Strategy; 2020 National Strategy for Critical and
Emerging Technologies, designed to actively promote innovation; and its
commitment to revise the US export policy for Unmanned Aerial Systems
(UAS). These policies were a good start, but not enough. Now President
Joe Biden has an opportunity to bring them to fruition.

To understand the rapid emergence of UAS threats, look no further than
the growth of Iran's military drone program in recent years, which also
extends to Iran-backed groups across various regional conflicts. This
includes Houthi rebels in Yemen using drones against Saudi Arabia, Hamas
deploying them against Israel in the Gaza Strip, and Iraq-based Shia
militia using them to attack US troops---likely including the recent
drone attack on Al Tanf, a remote US outpost on the Syrian-Jordanian
border. Iran's increasing use of this technology, specifically "suicide"
or "kamikaze" drones that fly into their targets and explode, requires
integrated air defenses and Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS)
technology. Regional US partners in the Middle East, which have
increasing requirements to deter Iranian aggression, will seek every
opportunity to acquire it from the US government.

[The US security establishment has long acknowledged that adversaries
like China and Iran are pursuing commercial, off-the-shelf technologies
that can threaten US personnel, penetrate allies' and partners' air
defenses, and generally challenge regional stability. But the US
approach still has room for improvement]{.underline}.

As part of its new CAT policy, the Biden administration is considering
expanding bureaucratic processes for arms sales to better safeguard US
interests---but this inadvertently chips away at the prime placement of
American aerospace and defense industries in the global marketplace.
Extending the processes for military arms sales and transfers risks
ceding the security cooperation space to US adversaries. [The United
States has a unique role in the world, and its national-security
interests---including its defense industrial base---shouldn't be
compromised]{.underline} (certainly not by the government) in pursuit of
a "level playing field," as recently advocated by Assistant Secretary of
State for Political-Military Affairs Jessica Lewis. For the US
government to suggest putting US industry on par with competitors is
counterintuitive; it is a national- and economic- security imperative
for the government to bolster US industry to excel with every possible
advantage.

**[[US security cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** historically
[encompasses]{.underline} facilitating arms sales, staging military
[training and exercises]{.underline}, developing interoperability [among
allies and partners]{.underline}, and bolstering the sovereign defense
capabilities of security partners. All these efforts **[[need to
continue at a deliberate pace]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[but]{.underline}
in a post-Cold War world, [[the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[no longer has a monopoly]{.mark} on]{.underline} arms sales with [an
overt technological advantage in all areas]{.underline}.

In recent years, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
capabilities became the focus of Chinese UAS production, and as then
Chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff Joe Dunford noted in 2018,
"**[[Whoever has the]{.mark} competitive [advantage in]{.mark}
[a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence [and can field systems]{.mark}
informed by artificial intelligence, [could]{.mark} very well [have an
overall competitive advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}**." Many of us in the
national-security enterprise at the time were also concerned with how AI
innovation would shape the development of drones and integrated
air-defense systems. [[With]{.mark} that [tech]{.mark}nological
[competition heating up, allies and partners matter more than
ever]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**[[To remain the "partner of choice" for]{.mark} its [allies]{.mark}
and partners, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [needs to work
closer]{.mark} with them [in collaborative
partnerships]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[such as]{.underline}]{.mark} the
trilateral **[[AUKUS]{.underline}]{.mark}** defense pact among the
United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom.
[[It]{.underline}]{.mark} [[can]{.mark} also [develop]{.mark} other
[proactive collaborative schemes]{.mark} in emerging technologies [to
enhance]{.mark} shared [capabilities and interoperability]{.mark}, help
security partners successfully meet updated UAS export policy, and
aggressively advocate for and develop integrated air-defense
capabilities]{.underline}.

**[For the sake of American interests, [the US]{.mark} government [must
carefully foster its partnerships and spark a level of defense
innovation to keep the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[and]{.mark} its [partners truly secure]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### Democracy solves multiple extinction risks 

Carla Zoe **Cremer &** Luke **Kemp 21**, The Future of Humanity
Institute, Oxford. Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, Cambridge.
\"Democratising Risk: In Search of a Methodology to Study Existential
Risk\" <https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2201/2201.11214.pdf> //pipk

[[There is a]{.mark}n intimate]{.underline} and neglected [[relationship
between existential risk and democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[Democracy must be central to]{.mark} efforts [to prevent]{.mark} and
mitigate [catastrophic risks]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It is also an
antidote to many of the problems manifest in the TUA. Do those who study
the future of humanity have good grounds to ignore the visions, desires,
and values of the very people whose future they are trying to protect?
[Choosing which risks to take must be a democratic
endeavour]{.underline}.

We [understand democracy]{.underline} here in accordance with Landemore
[as the rule of the]{.underline} cognitively [diverse many who are
entitled to equal decision-making power and partake in a democratic
procedure that includes both a deliberative element and one of
preference aggregation]{.underline} (such as majority voting)45,115.
Decision-making procedures are not either democratic or non- democratic,
but instead lie on a spectrum. They can be more or less democratic,
inclusive, and diverse.

We posit [three reasons]{.underline} for why we should democratise
research and decision-making in existential risk: [the nature of
collective decision-making about human futures, the superiority of
democratic reason, and democratic fail-safe mechanisms.]{.underline}

**[Avoiding human extinction]{.underline}**, or crafting a desirable
long-term future, **[is a communal project]{.underline}**. Scholars of
existential risk who take an interest in the future of Homo sapiens are
choosing to consider the species in its entirety. If certain views are
excluded, the arguments for doing so must be compelling.

**[[Democracy will improve]{.mark} our [judgments]{.mark} in both the
governance and the study of existential risks]{.underline}**. [Asking
how our actions today influence [the long-term]{.mark} future [is one of
the most difficult intellectual tasks]{.mark} to unravel, and if there
is a right path, **[democratic procedures]{.mark}** will **[have the
best shot]{.mark} at finding it**]{.underline}. Hong and Page116,117
demonstrate **[[both theoretically and computationally]{.mark} that [a
diverse group]{.mark} of problem-solving agents [will show greater
accuracy]{.mark} than a less diverse group, even if the individual
members of the diverse group were each less accurate.]{.underline}**
**[Accuracy gains from diversity trump gains from improving individual
accuracy]{.underline}**. Landemore115, builds on this work to advance a
probabilistic argument that **[inclusive democracies will, in
expectation, make epistemically superior choices to oligarchies or even
the wise few]{.underline}**. This is [supported by promising results in
inclusive, deliberative democratic experiments from around the
world]{.underline} 118. [In the long run, democracies should commit
fewer mistakes than alternative decision-making procedures]{.underline}.
If this is true, it should improve the accuracy of research efforts and
decision-making. We are more likely to make accurate predictions about
the mechanisms of extinction, probable futures, and risk prevention if
the field invites cognitive diversity, builds flat institutional
structures, and avoids conflicts of interest.

Thereare many ways to consider the interests of the many. Democratic
assemblies could allow global citizens to deliberate about the futures
they prefer, citizens could be surveyed, and the field of ERS itself
could be diversified. At the moment, the field is, as many academic
disciplines are, unrepresentative of humanity at large and variably
homogenous in respect to income, class, ideology, age, ethnicity,
gender, nationality, religion, and professional background. The latter
issue is particularly true of existential risk, which, despite being an
inherently interdisciplinary endeavour, is at the highest levels
dominated by analytic moral philosophers. We need to be vigilant to what
perspectives are not represented in the study of existential risk. An
awareness of bias will go some way towards mitigating its negative
effects. To get close to replicating the cognitive diversity found among
humans, we must begin by inviting different thinkers with different
values and beliefs into the field.

**[[Democracies]{.mark} can [limit harms]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Any
approach to [mitigating]{.mark} existential threats [could create
response risks]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the TUA seems particularly
vulnerable to this. [Despite good intentions and curiosity-driven
research, it could justify violence, dangerous technological
developments, or drastically constrain freedom in favour of (perceived)
security]{.underline}. If we hope to explore ideas but minimise harms,
[democracies can]{.underline} be used to [moderate]{.underline} the
[measures taken in response to harmful ideas]{.underline}. It seems, for
example, vanishingly unlikely that a diverse group of thinkers or even
ordinary citizens would entertain the idea of sacrificing 1 billion
living, breathing beings for an infinitesimal improvement in reaching an
intergalactic techno-utopia. In contrast, the TUA could recommend this
trade-off.

[The democratic constraint of extreme measures may simply be a form of
collective selfinterest. Voters are unlikely to tolerate global
catastrophic risks (GCRs), which incur the death of a sizeable portion
of the electorate, if they know they themselves could be
affected]{.underline}. We expect that scholars who do not support
sacrificing current lives in the name of abstract calculations, but
would still like to explore the use of expected value theory in
existential risk, will be in support of [[democratic fail-safe
mechanisms]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Empirically]{.underline}]{.mark}, this fail-safe mechanism [seems to
[work]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Even deeply imperfect democracies, like the
ones we inhabit now, often avert detrimental outcomes.]{.underline}
[[Democracies prevent famines]{.underline}]{.mark} 119 (although not
malnutrition)120. They [make [war]{.mark}]{.underline} --- a significant
driver of GCRs --- [less likely]{.underline} 121. The [inclusion of
diverse preferences in democracies]{.underline}, such as those achieved
through women's suffrage, further [decreases the likelihood of violent
conflict]{.underline} 122. [Citizens]{.underline} often
[show]{.underline} a [significant risk aversion in comparison to their
government]{.underline}. While surveys are notoriously difficult to
collect and interpret, existing **[data suggest that [the public has
little support for nuclear weapons use]{.mark}]{.underline}** 123--125,
**[[but]{.mark} strong [support]{.mark} for [action against
climate]{.mark} catastrophe]{.underline}** 126--128. We can further show
that **[[when citizens]{.mark} deliberately [engage]{.mark} with the
subject at hand, their [concern and readiness]{.mark} for action often
[increases]{.mark}]{.underline}** 118. For example, [citizen assemblies
on climate change have recommended widespread policy-changes across
sectors, amendments to incentive structures and laws against ecocide to
reach emissions targets]{.underline} 129. Indeed, many lament that when
it comes to genetically modified organisms and nuclear power, citizens
are far too riskaverse130 . The problem is not that the public is
riddled with cognitive biases that make them unconcerned about global
catastrophes.

**[[Democratic debate cannot be an afterthought.]{.mark} Navigating
humanity through [crises will involve]{.mark} many value-laden decisions
under deep [uncertainty]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Democratic procedures
can deal with such hard choices. Greater cognitive diversity should be
represented amongst scholars of ERS. Recommendations on [[policies that
would reduce risk should]{.mark} be passed through deliberative
assemblies and [await]{.mark} the [approval of]{.mark} a wider pool of
ordinary [citizens]{.mark}, as they will be the ones who will bear this
risk]{.underline}. A homogenous group of experts attempting to directly
influence powerful decision-makers is not a fair or safe way of
traversing the precipice.

#### Delays encourage allies to shift to China and Russia

[The United States aims to be the security cooperation partner of
choice, but competitors get a vote]{.underline}. [Chinese and Russian
security cooperation activities span the globe, looking to gain access
and influence, and often to supplant America's positions]{.underline}.
[These competitors are active suitors with a broad portfolio of
offerings to potential partners, and **America's missteps cede ground to
Beijing and Moscow**]{.underline}. As a result, key elements of
[American security cooperation ought to take this competitive
environment into account to seize strengths and opportunities while
stiff-arming weaknesses and constraints]{.underline}. With eyes around
the world fixed on Eastern Europe, one oft-discussed topic is America's
record of security cooperation with Ukraine since 2014. But some of the
most important lessons about U.S. security cooperation might come from
another country: Iraq. My experience leading security cooperation
efforts in Iraq offers a useful case study from which policymakers and
practitioners can draw lessons for U.S. efforts elsewhere in the world.

[When allies and partners consider America as a security cooperation
partner, their leaders take a variety of factors into account, but
foremost among these are quality, cost, and schedule]{.underline}. In
general, [American security cooperation activities provide quality
weapons systems at a reasonable cost, but **delivery schedules tend to
lag, frustrating partners and empowering competitors**]{.underline}. In
order to meet American needs, security cooperation ought to be more
timely, sustainable, consistent, and holistic.

As the senior defense official and defense attaché to Iraq during a
recent 14-month period, I managed a security cooperation portfolio with
the Iraqi Ministry of Defense's five military services, in addition to
programs with the Counter-Terrorism Service, the Kurdish Peshmerga, and
the Ministry of Interior's Border Guard Force. This \$20 billion
portfolio included programs ranging from long-term support for M1A1
Abrams tanks to pop-up security needs within the International Zone
during high-threat conditions. It was an environment rich with examples
of strategic competition. There, I learned of the power of properly
applied security cooperation programs and the pitfalls of security
cooperation missteps. These lessons have only been reinforced in my
current position.

Accelerating Capability Delivery

[From a quality perspective, the equipment that the United States can
offer to a partner nation is often superior]{.underline} (with notable
exceptions). A [partnership with the United States should be considered
a competitive advantage, especially when viewed through a long-term lens
in which the U.S military commits to effective and sustainable
capabilities known as the total package approach]{.underline}. This
approach provides not just the weapon system itself, but a broader
package of material and services including training, support equipment,
spare parts, publications, lifecycle maintenance, and technical
assistance. This stands in sharp contrast to security cooperation deals
with competitors that rarely provide more than the initial weapon system
as a part of their offerings.

[Effective and reliable host nation activity on the ramp or on the range
tangibly demonstrates the power of a thriving relationship, and a lack
thereof can quickly embitter a partnership]{.underline}. This is notably
true in Iraq as foreign-made T-90 tanks, CH-4 drones, T-50 aircraft, and
Mi-28 and Mi-35 helicopters languish in an inoperable state while
American equipment is largely reliable and operational. While the
partner nation has to pay for such quality and longevity, they can at
least trust that they are getting what they pay for and can expect to
rely upon such systems for decades to come. Thus, cost should be
considered neither a competitive advantage nor a competitive
disadvantage, although the American total package approach undoubtedly
provides an initial sticker shock until the benefits of this method of
sustainability are thoroughly explained to a partner.

**[Timeliness]{.underline}**, however, **[is a different
story]{.underline}**.

[American security cooperation faces a notable competitive disadvantage
in meeting the desired schedules of partner nations]{.underline}. The
Title 22 Foreign Military Sales process, developed to provide a
deliberate roadmap towards approval with a slew of checks and balances,
often takes years to deliver even simple off-the-shelf capabilities.
Meanwhile, [strategic competitors offer quick-turn solutions to
immediate problems that can satisfy demands in countries around the
world]{.underline}.

In the case of Iraq, the security cooperation office could expedite the
delivery of capabilities when necessary through the unique benefits of
access to Title 10, Section 333 resources (known as Authority to Build
Capacity) and some influence over the Counter-ISIS Train and Equip Fund
that circumvented normal Title 22 processes. [Security cooperation
offices in most other countries do not enjoy the flexibility that comes
with multiple authority and resource options, and are often forced to
rely upon slow and methodical Foreign Military Sales
processes]{.underline}. In the end, [improved responsiveness and
shortened delivery timelines are essential to meet an array of partner
nation requirements around the world. Strategic competitors are actively
trying to exploit this weakness in the American security cooperation
portfolio by offering what appear to be immediate
solutions]{.underline}.

<https://www.rand.org/blog/2022/03/making-aukus-work.html> //pipk

Russia\'s war in Ukraine brings into stark relief the true meaning of
revisionist power. It could serve as a catalyst to urgent action in
countering both Russian and Chinese revisionism. On September 15, 2021
President Biden announced the creation of AUKUS, a trilateral,
experimental arrangement among the United States, Australia, and the
United Kingdom focused on defense technology that would deliver nuclear
powered submarines to Australia by 2039. The President also made clear
that AUKUS would extend beyond cooperation on submarines, and these
sentiments have been echoed in Canberra and London.

Even with the ongoing war in Ukraine, Australian Secretary of Defence,
Greg Moriarty, is in Washington to discuss ways to get AUKUS moving.
AUKUS could open new avenues for cooperative development (co-designing)
and production (co-building) of armaments (the P-8, Triton, and Jammer
are examples to follow). Given the lag time to 2039, it would likely be
important to demonstrate the utility of AUKUS in facilitating a broader
defense relationship by laying out a realistic, clear-eyed vision for
the trilateral relationship, establishing a framework and plan to manage
the work, identify and then address the existing barriers, and ensure
that metrics are in place to measure progress. Taking all these steps
may help get AUKUS off the ground, which could bring major benefits to
the allies.

AUKUS is an example of mini-lateralism, which can be thought of as a
complement to---or a substitute for---traditional intergovernmental
cooperation. AUKUS isn\'t a new alliance. It\'s an additive, focused
security partnership that is intended to deepen collaboration on
advanced military capabilities and technologies including cyber,
artificial intelligence, and quantum concepts. It builds on the Defense
Trade Cooperation treaties negotiated by the Bush administration in 2007
and ratified in 2010. AUKUS presents new opportunities, the first and
most often mentioned is that it provides Australia with nuclear powered
submarine capability. The U.S. has only ever shared nuclear propulsion
technology once before, and that was with the United Kingdom. Second,
AUKUS aims to promote greater sovereign capability for Australian and
British defense industry by providing access to U.S. technology. Third,
it is designed to push back against any potential weakening of the
alliance bonds by selectively combining defense capability between
Australia, United Kingdom, and United States in the face of strategic
competition with China and Russia.

AUKUS could not only deliver new submarines for Australia, but it could
become the springboard for revolutionizing how the U.S. works with a
select group of its most capable allies.

The promise of AUKUS stems from the bringing together of three capable
allies in a grand experiment, with a high-stakes mini-lateral
relationship that depends first and foremost upon trust to deliver
highly valued capabilities. If effectively implemented, AUKUS would not
only deliver new submarines for Australia, but perhaps more importantly,
it could become the springboard for revolutionizing how the U.S. works
with a select group of its most capable allies through the extraordinary
depth of technological development, access to highly classified
materials and expanded sharing of intellectual property.

Canberra, London, and Washington have each responded to AUKUS
differently. While all are committed at the diplomatic level, Canberra
is perhaps the most deeply engaged, investing significant funding and
resources to ensure that both the nuclear-powered submarine and advanced
capabilities workstreams succeed. As one anonymous Australian official
noted, AUKUS has virtually restructured the entirety of their defense
and foreign affairs thinking. United Kingdom national security advisor
Stephen Lovegrove described AUKUS as "perhaps the most significant
capability collaboration anywhere in the world in the past six decades."
AUKUS fits neatly into the UK\'s Integrated Review, which promotes
London\'s return to the Indo-Pacific. Of the three powers involved,
however, the United Kingdom is, at least on the surface, the junior
partner. The U.S. sits somewhere in between, broadly keen to make it
work, but distracted by countless other major world events, like the
ongoing strategic competition with China.

The barriers to AUKUS success are numerous. At the national level, each
country has its own political and economic challenges. Australia will
face an election sometime between now and the end of May 2022. If the
current Morrison government wins re-election, then it\'s a safe bet that
AUKUS will continue along its current path. The opposition Labor party
has also indicated support for AUKUS, and Prime Minister Morrison wrote
to the Labor leader thanking him for his "bipartisan approach." Yet, a
new government brings with it a new set of priorities, which could have
consequences for the early stages of AUKUS\'s development. The U.S.
mid-term elections this year will soon distract Congress, and so the
legislative actions necessary to bring AUKUS into being may well have to
wait until 2023. The United Kingdom will go to the polls no later than
May 2024.

Given its considerable current international challenges, the United
States counts AUKUS as only one among many tasks it must undertake. An
essential element of AUKUS\'s success would require Congressional
action, including approval for the nuclear agreement under the Atomic
Energy Act. Beyond legislative compliance, the bureaucratic
infrastructure to implement AUKUS would need to quickly be established.
This includes funding and empowering the working groups with deep
analytic expertise to hammer out the details of the security pact. The
imbalance of interest between the three nations suggests that Australia
has the most to lose, and so it will likely invest the greater effort to
see that AUKUS succeeds.

What does AUKUS need to be effective?

AUKUS success depends upon the development of a new legislative
framework in the U.S., the commitment of organizational resources,
empowering the working groups tasked with governing AUKUS, ensuring
access to the requisite expertise, the ability to identify and manage
barriers to success, and the employment of measurable indicators of
success. These are not easy tasks, and each carries some risk.

An unprecedented U.S. legislative framework would include not only
information sharing agreements on nuclear propulsion, but also on much
broader areas in key sectors. Such a framework could allow for
innovation to flourish, particularly as AUKUS looks for opportunities in
artificial intelligence, quantum, and other key defense technologies.
The role of the private sector, and the complications therein, is an
under analyzed aspect to AUKUS. For example, Lockheed Martin was going
to provide Australia with the weapons systems for its recently
terminated French submarine contract; now the company may well be the
supplier of the weapons systems for newly planned Australian nuclear
submarine. And yet, just two days after the announcement of AUKUS, BAE
and Rolls Royce won the contract to design a new nuclear powered
submarine for the UK, which may have implications for Australia\'s new
submarine, and Lockheed, too. The involvement of defense industry will
also raise issues regarding commercial data sensitivities and
intellectual property issues---both of which should be studied, as they
may require additional legislative attention.

AUKUS would need to be adequately resourced to take on these tasks,
which would entail a distributed governance framework with shared
responsibilities and committed staff and resources, including political
and organizational support from Canberra, London, and Washington. In the
U.S., for example, the Departments of Defense, State and Energy would
have roles to play. It has been assumed that AUKUS is largely focused on
the Indo-Pacific, thus drawing interests from U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.
That said, given the broad technology interest in AUKUS, it also draws
in the Defense Technology Security Agency and Cyber Command. The U.K.
would see input from the Cabinet Office, the Ministry of Defence, the
Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the Royal Navy. In
Canberra the primary interests will be from the Department of Prime
Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the
Royal Australian Navy and the Department of Defence. Two Australian
cabinet officials have defence portfolios relevant to AUKUS, including
the minister for defence as well as the minister for defence industry.

In launching AUKUS, a number of working groups have been established to
study and flesh out the cooperative details. In order to be effective,
these working groups could be empowered by strong leadership, informed
by evidence-based analysis, and encouraged to convene regularly. They
could go beyond admiring the problems to identifying solutions. The
success of the working groups would also greatly depend on the active
and continuous support of senior leadership from all three nations.

AUKUS is likely to shine a bright light on the barriers to
collaboration---not only technical, but also bureaucratic, budgetary,
cultural, regulatory, political, and strategic.

More specifically, the AUKUS working groups could have access to the
requisite expertise. Senior leaders could also ensure that the working
groups have access to experts, practitioners, and program implementers
from Australia, the U.S., and the UK who would understand the breadth
and depth of the existing barriers and the necessary workarounds. This
could be challenging: in the process of developing the cooperative
framework, AUKUS is likely to shine a bright light on the many barriers
to collaboration---not only technical, but also bureaucratic, budgetary,
cultural, regulatory, political, and strategic.

AUKUS could benefit from clear, measurable outcomes for each working
group, developed from the outset. For example, successfully meeting
working group deliverable dates is an obvious and essential metric, as
is consistent maintenance of working group meeting schedules and speed
of decision making. Progress in armaments cooperation is another metric,
and includes changing processes that facilitate innovation and deepening
of cooperation. The ability to resolve key bureaucratic barriers (such
as routine overclassification of information) and regulatory challenges
(such as technology transfer limitations) would be yet another hurdle to
overcome. The three capitals might develop multi-year plans detailing
proposed projects, anticipated costs, and timelines for delivery.
Success on each of these projects could be reported annually.

The experiment of AUKUS clearly seems to offer significant opportunities
for Canberra, London, and Washington. More than a repackaging of
existing capabilities, AUKUS reimagines the way in which three capable
allies could work together, more closely than ever before, in many
respects. The potential success of AUKUS will rely upon the effective
management of this mini-lateral arrangement, and each countries\'
willingness to adopt new policies and make legislative changes to allow
for this close collaboration. Making such changes would require strong
management, but even more so, it would require the recognition from all
parties that such changes are necessary to make progress in addressing
common, overriding strategic goals. What happens now will determine
whether the U.S., Australia and the UK can compete more effectively
against China and Russia, or whether AUKUS becomes an interesting
footnote in the story of what could have been.
