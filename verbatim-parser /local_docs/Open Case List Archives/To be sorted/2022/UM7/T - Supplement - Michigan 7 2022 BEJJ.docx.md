# Resolved

## 1NC\-\--Resolved

#### Resolved requires a specific course of action 

**AHD 6**

(American Heritage Dictionary,
http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/[resolved]{.underline})

INTRANSITIVE VERB:1. [[To reach a decision]{.mark} or make a
determination: **[resolve on a course of action]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
2. To become separated or reduced to constituents. 3. Music To undergo
resolution.

#### Violation -- the Aff read 7 plans by including "one or more of the following"

\-\--any one, any two, or all three

**Dahmani 87** -- Martinus Nijhoff publishers

(Mohamed, "The Fisheries Regime of the Exclusive Economic Zone," p.
70-71)

Secondly, [[the use of the expression]{.underline}]{.mark} \'sub-region
**[[or]{.underline}]{.mark}** region\' [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[ambiguous]{.underline}]{.mark}. If [[the word \'or\' means **a
choice**]{.underline}]{.mark} for land-locked and geographically
disadvan-taged states then obviously a region might be a better area
than a sub-region. Whereas for a coastal state in whose EEZ fishing is
to take place it would be advantageous to limit fishing rights to the
EEZ\'s of states of the sub-region rather than the region as a whole.
**[[There are two possible interpretations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
first is chat where there is a sub-region land-locked and geographically
disad-vantaged states\' participation applies only to such sub-region.
In other words, it will apply to a region only when there is no
generally recognised sub-region, as in Latin America where the Caribbean
is generally regarded as a sub-region of the Latin American region. A
second, more favourable interpretation to land-locked and geographically
disadvantaged states is that participation applies to both sub-region
and region.¶ Similarly, [problems of interpretation may]{.underline}
also [arise]{.underline} in connection with the definition of
geographically disadvantaged states. Article 70(2) docs not proceed on
the basis of any definition of such states.

#### Vote neg:

#### \-\--Aff conditionality -- "one or more of the following" enables aff choice, always favors the aff because they get to choose in the last speech. 

#### \-\--Ground -- stable plan text is only way to garner DA or counterplan competition -- has a tangible effect because discourages introducing DAs about either

#### \-\--Jurisdiction -- if you don't know definitely what the plan does, you can't vote for it

**Burstyn 11** -- JD, not the Copeland winner

(Joseph Burstyn, JD "Void for Vagueness Doctrine," 2011,
http://law.jrank.org/pages/11152/Void-Vagueness-Doctrine.html)

[[If a person of ordinary intelligence cannot determine]{.mark} what
persons are regulated, [what conduct is]{.mark} [prohibited]{.mark}, or
what punishment may be imposed under a particular law, [then the law
will be]{.mark} [deemed **unconstitutionally vague**]{.mark}**.** The
U.S. Supreme Court has said that no one may be required]{.underline} at
peril of life, liberty, or property [to speculate as to the meaning of
a]{.underline} penal [law]{.underline}. Everyone is entitled to know
what the government commands or forbids. The void for vagueness doctrine
advances four underlying policies. First, [[the]{.mark} [doctrine
encourages the government to clearly distinguish]{.mark}]{.underline}
conduct that is [[law]{.underline}]{.mark}ful from that which is
unlawful. Under the Due Process Clauses, individuals must be given
adequate notice of their legal obligations so they can govern their
behavior accordingly. [[When individuals are left uncertain]{.mark} by
the wording of an imprecise statute, [the law]{.mark} [becomes a
**standardless trap** for the unwary]{.mark}]{.underline}.

## 2NC\-\--Overview

#### The aff read 7 plans, not 1- this isn't 1982

-ai

-cyber

-biotech

-ai + cyber

-ai + biotech

-biotech + cyber

-ai + biotech + cyber

#### Three impacts:

#### FIRST -- 2ar sandbagging -- they will choose the strategic version of the plan based on negative strategy. For example, if we said the plan was insufficient to solve the advantage, they would say they are ai, cyber, AND biotech, but if we read a cyber da, they'd say they were just ai

#### SECOND -- the plan text is key, and it's meaning should be up for debate. Letting the aff exclusively decide the meaning of the plan tanks counterplan competition and motivates aff laziness because who needs to cut answers when they can just say no link

#### THIRD -- presumption -- even a hint of uncertainty about the conduct done by the plan means the plan should be void

## 2NC\-\--Interp: Resolved

#### Resolved means determined and firm in intent

**Shannon 2** -- Professor of Law

(Bradley Scott, Associate Professor of Law, ARTICLE: ACTION IS AN ACTION
IS AN ACTION IS AN ACTION, Washington Law Review, January, 2002, 77
Wash. L. Rev. 65, pg. ln)

The first answer to this question is, why should we not care? If proper
terminology (of whatever type) is readily available and comprehendible,
why should one not want to use it? Does one really need a reason for not
misusing any word, technical or otherwise? In other words, though many
misuses of Rules terminology might not seem to cause serious problems,
surely that is not an argument in favor of a disregard of proper Rules
terminology, particularly where the cost of using proper terminology is
negligible. n79 The second answer to the question why we should care
about the use of proper Rules terminology goes to the cost of using
improper terminology even in seemingly trivial contexts. [[Understanding
legal concepts is difficult enough without]{.mark} the
[confusion]{.mark} created [when an inappropriate term is
used]{.mark}]{.underline} to represent those concepts. And [[this is
true]{.mark} **[regardless of how minor]{.mark}** the
misuse.]{.underline} In some sense, every misuse of legal language
impedes the understanding - and, consequently, the progress - of the
law. There are at least two additional reasons, somewhat unique to the
law, why one should always strive to use proper Rules terminology. The
first reason relates to the nature of the Rules as law (or, as some
prefer, a source of law). Many bodies of professional terminology might
be considered in some way authoritative, in that reliance thereon not
only is widespread, it is almost viewed as compulsory. n80 But the Rules
\[\*86\] essentially are of the same character as a federal statute. n81
And despite the fact that there is often no direct penalty for the
misuse or disregard of Rules terminology, n82 the Rules, by their
nature, nonetheless command respect and, in some sense, obeisance. n83
[Another reason for using proper legal terminology goes to
persuasion.]{.underline} As most good attorneys know, [[using
proper]{.mark}]{.underline} procedural [[terminology is]{.mark} almost
[as important as using the Rules themselves
properly]{.mark},]{.underline} as the use of proper terminology enhances
the perceived credibility and competence of the proponent, and helps
convey the image of the proponent as the giver of the truth. n84 [Though
this is probably true of every profession, [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[\*87\] [[stature of argument, and]{.mark} thus of [persuasion, in
legal discourse magnifies its importance in the
law]{.mark}]{.underline}. n85

#### [Strong negative presumption]{.underline} -- even if they intended for the plan to be read a certain way, the judge should not apply sloppily worded laws, anything else is unconstitutional and prohibitive to clear DA and counterplan links

**Burstyn 11** -- JD, not the Copeland winner

J(oseph Burstyn, JD "Void for Vagueness Doctrine," 2011,
http://law.jrank.org/pages/11152/Void-Vagueness-Doctrine.html)

Third, [[the void for vagueness doctrine discourages judges from
attempting to apply sloppily worded laws]{.underline}]{.mark}. Like the
rest of society, [judges often labor without success when interpreting
poorly worded legislation]{.underline}. In particular cases, [courts may
attempt to narrowly construe a vague statute so that it applies only to
a finite set of circumstances]{.underline}. For example, [some courts
will permit prosecution]{.underline} under a vague law [if the
government can demonstrate that the defendant acted with a SPECIFIC
INTENT]{.underline} to commit an offense, which means that the defendant
must have acted wilfully, knowingly, or deliberately. By reading a
specific intent requirement into a vaguely worded law, courts attempt to
insulate innocent behavior from criminal sanction.
[However]{.underline}, such judicial constructions are not always
possible. [Ultimately, [a confusing law that cannot be cured by a
narrow]{.mark} [judicial interpretation]{.mark} will not be submitted to
a jury for consideration [but will be struck down as an unconstitutional
violation of the Due Process Clauses]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Vote neg on presumption -- the plan will be [intentionally]{.underline} misinterpreted by forces of inertia

**Crabble 88** -- Honorable Justice, Professor of Law @ West Indies

(The Honorable Mr. Justice V.C.R.A.C. Crabbe, Visiting Professor of Law
& Director, Legislative Drafting Programme, Faculty of Law, University
of the West Indies, Barbados, Statute Law Review 2, Summer)

And advocates would always argue as to where a comma or a semi-colon
should be placed. This is done because a particular interpretation
favours a particular presentation of a particular line of argument. It
cannot be otherwise. Out of the anvil of argument justice, as far as
humanly possible, is done. And the legislative draftsman, nonetheless
will have to use punctuation marks in drafting the law. The less room he
leaves for argument the better. And we cannot ignore the observation of
Stephen J., that [although Acts]{.underline} of Parliament "[may be easy
to understand, people continually try to misunderstand]{.underline}."
[[The legislative]{.underline}]{.mark} draftsman
[[must]{.underline}]{.mark}, therefore [not only "[attain]{.mark} to a
degree of [precision]{.mark} which a person reading in good faith can
understand, but it [is necessary to attain if possible to a degree of
precision which a person reading in bad faith **cannot
misunderstand**]{.mark}. It is all the better if he cannot pretend to
misunderstand it]{.underline}."34

Infosecurity Magazine
<https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/nato-rapid-cyber-response/>)
//LVL

[[NATO has]{.mark} announced **[plans to develop]{.mark}** virtual rapid
response [capabilities "to respond to]{.mark} significant malicious
[cyber activities]{.mark}]{.underline}." The plans were unveiled in a
declaration published following the NATO Summit in Madrid, Spain, last
week. The latest summit took on extra significance in light of the
Russian invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, amid fears of the
conflict spilling beyond the current borders into NATO territory.
Referring to the war, the declaration read: "We, the Heads of State and
Government of the North Atlantic Alliance, have gathered in Madrid as
war has returned to the European continent. We face a critical time for
our security and international peace and stability." Among other areas,
the declaration outlined an [[agreement]{.mark} between member countries
"on a voluntary basis and using national assets, [to **build** and
exercise a virtual rapid response cyber
capability]{.mark}."]{.underline} The military alliance acknowledged
that "we are confronted by cyber, space and hybrid and other asymmetric
threats, and by the malicious use of emerging and disruptive
technologies."

# Substantially Increase

## 1NC\-\--50%

**Interpretation**: **[Substantially]{.underline} increase means
[greater than 50%]{.underline}**

**Brown 94** (Mark R., Professor of Law -- Stetson University College of
Law, "The Demise of Constitutional Prospectivity: New Life for Owen?",
Iowa Law Review, January, 79 Iowa L. Rev. 273, Lexis)

n241 I am assuming here that \"foreseeable\" means \"probable,\" as in
\"more probable than not.\" This appears to be a safe assumption given
the proliferance of cases granting immunity to officials who offend the
Constitution. If this definition is correct, deterrence only works and
liability should only attach if one\'s conduct, viewed ex ante, is more
likely illegal than legal: the risk of illegality must be more than
fifty percent. In other words, one cannot face deterrence, and liability
will not attach, if the risk of illegality is less than fifty percent[.
(When viewed in this fashion, one might perceive a risk]{.underline} of
illegality but still not be deterrable because the risk [is
**[not]{.mark} [substantial, i.e., not greater than fifty
percent]{.mark}**.).]{.underline} Lawful conduct, of course, need not be
probably lawful. That is what risk is about. Situations might arise
where the objective risk is that conduct is unlawful, but ex post it is
lawful. Lest judicial reasoning be completely askew, a fairly strong
correlation exists, however, between action that is ex ante probably
lawful and that which is lawful ex post in the courts. If this is not
true, then courts are reaching objectively improbable conclusions, and
the whole idea of reliance is illusory.

#### Violation \[the aff doesn't increase security cooperation by more than 50% is a small subset of security cooperation\].

#### Vote neg for limits and ground, they allow thousands of miniscule subsets that no-link all neg generics.

## 1NC/2NC\-\--General

### Subs = Needs a Baseline

#### "Substantial" must be measured relative to baseline numbers to the [overall]{.underline} category

**Small Business Administration, 10** ("A Guide for Government Agencies
How to Comply with the Regulatory Flexibility Act," June,
http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/rfaguide.pdf

[[Legislative history of "substantial]{.mark} number."]{.underline} To
affect a substantial number, a proposed regulation must certainly have
an impact on at least one small entity. At the other end of the range,
legislative history would not require agencies "to find that an
overwhelming percentage \[more than half\] of small \[entities\] would
be affected" before requiring an IRFA. 63 [Legislative history also says
that the term "substantial" is intended to mean a substantial number of
entities within a particular economic or other activity]{.underline}. 64
The intent of the RFA, therefore, was not to require that agencies find
that a large number of the entire universe of small entities would be
affected by a rule[. [Quantification of "substantial]{.mark}" may be
industry- or rule-specific]{.underline}. However, [it is very important
that agencies use the broadest category, "[more than just a
few]{.mark}]{.underline}," when initially reviewing a regulation before
making the decision to certify or do an initial regulatory flexibility
analysis. The goal at this stage of the process is to ensure that the
broadest possible impacts are fully considered. [The interpretation of
the term "substantial number" is not likely to be five small firms in an
industry with more than 1,000 small firms. On the other hand, it is
important to recognize that five small firms in an industry with only 20
small firms would be a substantial number]{.underline}. Depending on the
rule, [the [substantiality]{.mark} of the number of small businesses
affected [should be determined]{.mark} [on]{.mark} an industry-specific
basis and/or on the [number of]{.mark} small businesses
[overall]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, the Internal Revenue
Service, when changing the tax deposit rules, would examine the entire
universe of small businesses to see how many would be affected. On the
other hand, a change by the Food and Drug Administration in the
regulation of meat irradiators might affect only 15 firms, but that
would be the entire industry.

### Subs = 33-40% Increase f/baseline

**"Substantial" means 40% \-\-- strict quantification avoids vagueness**

**Schwartz 4** (Arthur, Lawyer -- Schwartz + Goldberg, 2002 U.S. Briefs
1609, Lexis)

In the opinion below, [the [Tenth Circuit suggested]{.mark} that a
[percentage figure]{.mark} would be **a [way to avoid vagueness]{.mark}
[issues]{.mark}**]{.underline}. (Pet. App., at 13-14) Indeed, one of the
Amici supporting the City in this case, [the American Planning
Association, [produced]{.mark} a [publication that]{.mark} actually
[makes]{.mark} a [recommendation of a percentage
figure]{.mark}]{.underline} that should be adopted by municipalities in
establishing zoning  \[\*37\]  regulations for adult businesses. [n8 The
[APA\'s well researched report]{.mark} [recommended]{.mark} that the
terms [\"**substantial\"**]{.mark} **and \"significant\" be [quantified
at 40 percent]{.mark}**]{.underline} for floor space or inventory of a
business in the definition of adult business. n9 (Resp. Br. App., at
15-16)

**"Substantial" means 33 percent**

**Maples 7** (Larry, "Pitfalls in Preserving Net Operating Losses", The
CPA Journal, 3-1, Lexis)

If a new loss corporation has substantial nonbusiness assets, the value
of the old loss corporation must be reduced by the amount of the
nonbusiness assets less liabilities attributable to those assets[.
[\"Substantial\" is defined as one-third of total
assets]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} This is a difficult provision
to interpret. IRC section 382(1)(4) provides that a value reduction in
the old loss corporation is required if, just after an ownership change,
the new loss corporation has substantial nonbusiness assets. This
language seems odd because the purpose of IRC section 382 is to prevent
loss trafficking, so it would seem that the asset test ought to apply to
the old loss corporation.

### Subs = Across the Board

#### "Substantially means across the board

Brian **Anderson 5**, Becky Collins, Barbara Van Haren & Nissan Bar-Lev,
WCASS Research / Special Projects Committee\* Report on: A Conceptual
Framework for Developing a 504 School District Policy,
<http://www.specialed.us/issues-504policy/504.htm>

[A substantial limitation is a significant restriction]{.underline} as
to the condition, manner, or duration [under which an individual can
perform a particular major life activity]{.underline} as
[compared]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [the]{.underline} condition,
manner, or duration under which the [average person in the general
population]{.underline} can perform that same major life activity.¶ The
504 regulation does not define substantial limitation, and the
regulation gives discretion to schools to decide what substantial
limitation is. The key here is to be consistent internally and to be
consistent with pertinent court decisions.¶ [The issue "Does it
substantially limit]{.underline} the major life activity?" [was
clarified by the US Supreme Court]{.underline} decision on January 8th,
2002 , "Toyota v. Williams". In this labor related case, [[the Supreme
Court]{.mark} noted that to meet the "[substantially]{.mark} limit"
[definition]{.mark}]{.underline}, the disability [[must occur **across
the board**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in multiple environments]{.underline},
not only in one environment or one setting. The implications for school
related 504 eligibility decisions are clear: The disability in question
must be manifested in all facets of the student's life, not only in
school.

#### "Substantial" in the context of security cooperation means affecting political interaction, diplomatic support, capacity building, and military cooperation

**Grønning 18** \[Bjørn Elias Mikalsen; Researcher and Professor at the
Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies (Norwegian Defence University
College) and Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU);
2018; The Pacific Review; "Japan\'s security cooperation with the
Philippines and Vietnam";
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09512748.2017.1397730\]

Replacing the National Defense Program Guideline (NDPG) as the capstone
document of its security policy, [Japan issued its first National
Security Strategy (NSS) in December 2013. 'In order to overcome national
security challenges and achieve national security
objectives,']{.underline} the document notes, 'Japan needs to expand and
deepen cooperative relationships with other countries \[...\]' (National
Security Council of Japan, 2013, p. 14). This statement codifies a
recent trend in Tokyo's foreign policy, namely a push to diversify its
bilateral security ties, long the exclusive purview of the Japan--US
alliance. [[Japan's increasingly]{.mark} comprehensive and
[**substantial** **security** **cooperation** with]{.mark} the
[Philippines and Vietnam are two notable examples]{.mark}]{.underline}.
These are the topic of this article, which seeks answers to questions
such as these: What are the characteristics of Japan's maturing security
relationships with the Philippines and Vietnam? What factors have driven
and enabled their recent emergence, and what promotes and constrains
their further development? What, finally, do they suggest about Japan's
future direction as a security actor in the region and beyond?

The article argues that [Japan's [security cooperation]{.mark} with the
Philippines and Vietnam [has]{.mark} their six [**basic**
**characteristics**]{.mark} in common: the 'Strategic Partnership'
diplomatic superstructure, regularization of **strategic**
**dialogues**, [**increasing**]{.mark} frequency of high-level
[**political** **interaction**, diplomatic **support**]{.mark} in
territorial disputes with China, aid-based maritime [**capacity**
**building**]{.mark}, and increasingly substantial [**military**
**cooperation**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The article moreover argues that
Japan's [substantiation of these non-US security bilaterals]{.underline}
is fundamentally driven by the contemporary power shift in East Asia and
the strategic challenge with which China's emerging maritime power and
behavior presents Japan. It has been pursued under American auspices and
further invited by Japanese nationalism and security legislative
reforms. Notwithstanding these incentives to further substantiate the
two security bilaterals, Japan faces considerable domestic and
geo-strategic constraints and counterincentives. For this reason, the
article concludes that we are to expect further substantiation, but
limited military significance, from the Japan's 'Strategic Partnerships'
with the Philippines and Vietnam.

[As that analysis makes clear, just meeting NATO's 2-percent
defense-spending goal will not be sufficient to resolve the substantial
readiness and sustainment deficiencies in]{.underline} any [reasonable
timeframe]{.underline}. To be sure, the [2-percent goal is important,
but [**NATO** needs to]{.mark} [establish]{.mark} an [additional
readiness/sustainment initiative]{.mark} over a shorter period---perhaps
three or four years---[that would **substantially** **increase**]{.mark}
the [readiness of national forces]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The [[large increases in **Germany's** **investment** budget **provide**
a **model**]{.mark} for a budgetary approach that should be undertaken
by other countries. [Germany has promised to reach]{.mark} [2 percent
annually]{.mark}, including [by]{.mark} spending one hundred billion
euros over a four-year period on investment.]{.underline}5 Other
countries should follow the German approach and [[establish **special**
**investment**-funding **streams**]{.mark} focused [on **readiness** and
**sustainability**]{.mark} that would be designed to resolve the
shortfalls in a three-to-four-year period. Along with the funding
increases, and as an additional part of a NATO readiness/sustainment
effort,]{.underline} the Supreme Allied Commander for Europe (SACEUR)
should be given the task (and authority) to review and report on the
readiness of the forces that will be called upon in the event of a
contingency[. A [focused effort]{.mark} on **readiness** **and**
**sustainability**, generated through the defense-planning process and
overseen by the SACEUR, will [significantly enhance NATO's]{.mark}
deterrent and [defense posture]{.mark}]{.underline}

Over the past decade, the increasing scope, pace, and cost of Department
of Defense ([DOD]{.underline}) **[security cooperation]{.underline}**
[missions have raised many questions about appropriate DOD and State
Department roles and responsibilities]{.underline} in and the utility of
such efforts. For some policymakers, DOD\'s new and expanded missions
enable the United States to meet the challenges of the complex global
security environment more effectively. As such[, **[congressional
approval]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [new [DOD **security
cooperation statutes**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[represents a **necessary
response** to perceived shortcomings of the]{.mark} **[overarching legal
regime]{.mark}**]{.underline} through which, for more than 50 years,
Congress has largely authorized and funded the State Department to lead
and DOD to administer security assistance to foreign countries. Other
[policymakers]{.underline}, however, [question whether DOD\'s growing
emphasis on and authority to conduct security cooperation]{.underline}
missions [undermines the State Department\'s lead role in assisting
foreign security forces and \"militarizes\" U.S. foreign
policy.]{.underline}

[[Since]{.mark}]{.underline} the terrorist attacks of [[September
11]{.mark}, 2001, [Congress has **given DOD increasing authority** to
conduct]{.mark}]{.underline} a wide array of [[security
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} programs [[under **Title 10**]{.mark}
**of the U.S. Code**]{.underline}, [[which
**governs**]{.underline}]{.mark} [the organization and operations of
[DOD]{.mark} and U.S. military [forces]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as
through the annual National Defense Authorization Acts. [DOD may
conduct]{.underline} activities such as [training, equipping,
and]{.underline} otherwise [supporting foreign military
forces]{.underline} to fight terrorist groups or to enable them to
participate in coalition or other operations. [[DOD
may]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[conduct humanitarian assistance]{.mark},
military and government educational programs, and other initiatives to
assist foreign militaries, as well as their governments and
populations]{.underline}. Such activities are intended to encourage
better relations between DOD personnel and representatives from foreign
militaries, governments, and populations.

[This report provides a general overview of current DOD Title 10
authorities to assist foreign governments]{.underline}, militaries,
security forces, and populations funded by the DOD budget. It presents
background information on the evolving DOD security cooperation mission
and [the [recent]{.mark} development of **the [statutory
framework]{.mark}** [through which DOD conducts **security
cooperation**]{.mark} activities]{.underline}. It provides summary
overviews of nine categories of security cooperation assistance and
activities, including the amounts of congressionally authorized funding,
where available, and any legislatively required State Department input.1
It discusses recent issues related to the development, implementation,
sustainment, and coordination of security cooperation to support
continuing congressional oversight. Two tables in the appendix provide
information on current Title 10 security cooperation authorities. The
first catalogs current security cooperation authorities, noting
legislative mandates for State Department input and notification and
reporting requirements. The second provides a snapshot of authorized
and/or appropriated funding levels for select security cooperation
authorities.2

Congress has several avenues of influence in the design, implementation,
and oversight of U.S. security cooperation activities.
[[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} determines which activities and
operations will be conducted, and it provides input on the selection of
recipient countries, organizations, and groups. [**It [defines the
division of labor]{.mark}** [between DOD, the State
Department]{.mark}]{.underline}, and other agencies, including
specifying the modes of interagency collaboration. It determines the
levels of assistance and appropriates funds. In addition, Congress sets
conditions on how the funds may be used and, through its committees,
oversees security cooperation activities by instituting reporting and
assessment requirements.

**[Terminology: Security Assistance and Security
Cooperation]{.underline}**

\"[Security assistance\" and \"security cooperation\" are **two
terms**]{.underline} [that refer to U.S. activities to train, equip, and
otherwise assist foreign partners.]{.underline} The term [[security
assistance is]{.underline}]{.mark} a generic term used throughout the
U.S. government [[to describe assistance]{.mark} provided to foreign
military and security forces[, **regardless of the
agency**]{.mark}]{.underline} providing that assistance. However, [[DOD
uses the term security assistance]{.mark} to refer specifically to

Background

[[The DOD role in]{.mark} U.S. [assistance]{.mark}]{.underline} to
train, equip, and otherwise support foreign military (and at times other
security) forces [has **[evolved over]{.mark} recent
[decades.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Since [military aid became a major
component of U.S. foreign [assistance to counter
the]{.mark}]{.underline} rise of the [[Soviet Union]{.underline}]{.mark}
after World War II, the State Department has historically exercised the
lead in security assistance activities.5 [Since]{.underline}
19[61]{.underline}, [Congress generally authorized]{.underline} military
and other **[[security assistance under Title 22]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of the U.S. Code, [funded it through the State Department]{.underline}
budget, and charged the Secretary of State with responsibility to
provide \"continuous supervision and general direction\" to ensure its
coherence with foreign policy.6 [[With]{.mark} certain [exceptions,
security assistance was largely a **secondary DOD
mission**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Beginning [in the]{.underline} 19[80s]{.underline}, [[Congress began to
expand]{.mark} gradually [the scope]{.mark} and character [of the
**statutory framework** by authorizing DOD to]{.mark}
directly]{.underline} train, equip, and otherwise [[assist]{.mark}
foreign military]{.underline} and other security [[forces
through]{.mark} new provisions in annual NDAAs]{.underline}, some
[codified to [Title 10]{.mark}]{.underline} of the U.S. Code. Following
the September 11th attacks, U.S. government periodic planning documents
indicated that the changing security environment presented a new set of
challenges.7 Instead of combating nation-states, the U.S. military would
increasingly face networks of non-state actors in areas where the United
States was not necessarily conducting combat operations. To achieve
success in these areas, successive Administrations judged that
countering decentralized networks of violent extremists would require
long, complex operations involving the U.S. military, other government
agencies, and international partners.8 Accordingly, [many in DOD and
elsewhere maintained that the U.S. military needed to adopt an indirect
approach that increased partner capacit]{.underline}y (better known by
the term \"building partner capacity,\" or BPC) for a variety of
purposes, to include: the more effective prosecution of counterterrorism
operations, increasing the capacity of states to manage their own
regional security challenges in order to prevent an eventual U.S. or
international crisis intervention, and as an exit strategy for post-9/11
military campaigns.9 To implement such concepts, DOD requested that
Congress grant new authorities to build the capabilities of partner
nations and enhance interoperability with U.S. forces, some of which
Congress granted.

Partner Capacity?' Issues for Congress", 12/18/2015, Congressional

[Security assistance, by contrast, is defined as a group of programs
authorized by Title 22]{.underline} of the U.S. Code, as amended, or
other related statutes by which the United States provides defense
articles, military training, and other defense-related services by
grant, loan, credit, cash sales, or lease, in furtherance of national
policies and objectives.17

**[Security assistance is a subset of security
cooperation]{.underline}**,18 and BPC, in its current formulation,
appears to be associated with those security cooperation and assistance
activities designed to enable weakened or fragile states to manage their
own security challenges. Although all DOD aspects of security assistance
programs are administered by DSCA, the agency is not responsible for the
department\'s broader strategy and non-programmatic elements of security
cooperation or building partner capacity.19

Departments of State and Defense", 05/26/2016, Congressional Research

[DOD uses an overarching term, "Security Cooperation," to denote the
State Department security assistance administered by DSCA as well as all
other DOD "interactions with foreign defense establishments to build
defense relationships]{.underline}." This term addresses the lack of
common terminology for DOD's many noncombat activities and contacts,
including not only the provision of defense articles and services, but
also humanitarian assistance, exercises, and military-tomilitary
contacts that benefit both U.S. and foreign forces. [These
"interactions" include programs to provide defense articles and services
to foreign governments for which Congress provides DOD with specific
authority, as well as programs and military exercises conducted under
DOD's organic Title 10 authority]{.underline}

[**Despite the formal DOD definition**, personnel and entities within
DOD use the term "security assistance" to include Title 10 assistance
and activities]{.underline}. For instance, the name of the unit
responsible for implementing Navy assistance and activities across the
security cooperation spectrum is Naval Education and Training Security
Assistance Field Activity (NETSAFA).

[Some congressional documents do the same]{.underline}. For instance,
Section 1211 of the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA,
P.L. 113-291) requiring a biennial report on 19 Title 10 authorities or
programs to train, equip, otherwise assist or reimburse foreign security
forces refers to those authorities as security assistance.

In the past three years, William Slade, USASAC's country program manager

neighboring militaries. In major FMS [announcements released by the

and defensive capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} to include Joint Light
Tactical Vehicles (JLTV), UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters, Javelin
missiles, and many other operational and tactical equipment items. These
equipment items would also enable the Baltic states to gain significant
interoperability with U.S. and NATO forces.

#### OCOs prove offensive capabilities are used as a part of NATO's collective defense strategies -- cyber policy proves

//LVL

But the seeds were also planted in 2016 for NATO to consider a potential
role for offensive cyber operations. That year, the alliance recognized
cyberspace as a domain of military operations, comparable to land, sea,
and air. At the 2018 Brussels summit, NATO began to more seriously
consider offensive cyber operations. Specifically, [[NATO
created]{.mark} the [Cyberspace Operations Centre to coordinate requests
for]{.mark} member states to provide [offensive cyber effects]{.mark}
through the Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies
process]{.underline}. Following the 2018 summit, then-Secretary of
Defense James Mattis stated in a press conference that five states---the
United States, the United Kingdom, Denmark, the Netherlands, and
Estonia---were contributing cyber forces to "help NATO fight in this
important domain." More recently, in June 2021, NATO convened in
Brussels and committed to a Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy. A [key
[feature of the]{.mark} new [policy is the prominent role of
o]{.mark}ffensive [c]{.mark}yber [o]{.mark}perations]{.underline}. In
Brussels, [member states committed to "employ the full range of
capabilities at all times to actively deter, defend against, and counter
the full spectrum of cyber threats.]{.underline}" [[NATO]{.mark}'s shift
to [incorporating offensive]{.mark} cyber [operations into existing
strategy]{.mark} and [policy]{.mark} has [focused on integrating
offensive effects]{.mark} into conventional military plans and
operations in the context of a conflict.]{.underline} While NATO's
updated strategy is a positive development, its limited focus on
conflict scenarios for employing cyber power fails to accurately account
for the cyber threat environment NATO faces---particularly the mismatch
between the alliance's clear distinction between wartime and peacetime
and the approach of adversaries like Russia, who adopt a
competition-conflict continuum. Additionally, the focus on employing
offensive cyber during a high-end conventional fight is also not
consistent with how [several NATO members are already engaged in gray
zone offensive cyber operations.]{.underline}

Second, [the [use]{.mark} of the word ['deterrence' in connection with
cyberspace is]{.mark} significant, because it is [another step towards
the **acceptance of offensive cyber capabilities as part of collective
defence**.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, linking deterrence to cyber
defence is difficult. The line of argument is simple: how can you
achieve deterrence when your adversaries are not afraid of you, because
they do not know what offensive capabilities you have and when and how
you would use them? Others view the term more broadly, and they are
willing to admit that there exists something like 'deterrence by
denial'. The extension of deterrence to the cyber realm should be
considered by NATO, but it relies primarily on the will of nations.
[Third, the idea of moving towards [recognition of offensive
cyber]{.mark} capabilities [is supported by]{.mark} the [statement that
cyber defence will be integrated into]{.mark} operational planning and
NATO's [operations and missions]{.mark}.]{.underline} [As NCIA is
already responsible for protecting NATO networks in an operational
setting, this **statement makes little sense if it only refers to
passive capabilities**.]{.underline} Nevertheless, no official
commitment was made in this regard, as the Alliance continues to avoid
public statements about offensive cyber capabilities.

transfers. These data run from 1950 to 2010 in our sample. Our data on
multilateral military exercises come from a data set compiled by the
political scientist Vito D'Orazio from an examination of major news
sources between 1970 and 2010.12 Although the SIPRI data provide a

[Security cooperation implies relying on other states for national
survival]{.underline}, which is hard to reconcile with exclusive
reliance on self-help. In addition, [security cooperation **limits the
freedom to act and constrains one\'s ability to maximize military
power**]{.underline}. Arms control aims at reducing offensive,
destabilizing options, and enhanced transparency may reduce the chances
of achieving surprise. In wartime alliances, [mutual dependency is
high.]{.underline} As a state\'s existence is at stake in war, relying
on someone else is an existential issue; strategic choices have to be
closely coordinated, and freedom of action might be lost. Peacetime
alliances can be more relaxed and may be little more than token promises
that might be broken in the moment of truth. But they may as well entail
intimate structural cooperation or integration[. The degree of mutual
knowledge, transparency, and dependence within NATO is inexplicable,
seen from the perspective of potential future hostilities]{.underline}.
NATO member states put much more on the line than participants in
average arms control or nonproliferation agreements: Alliance
cooperation presents a puzzle as well.

## 1NC\-\--SC\-\--Excludes NATO Exercises

#### Security cooperation is distinct from a NATO exercise \-\-- incorrect terminology leads to [decreased national security]{.underline}

Nathan L. **Fenell 11**, thesis for Master of Arts in International

University of San Francisco,
https://repository.usfca.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&context=thes

As a major in the Marine Corps, I planned and participated in a security
cooperation exercise with Estonia. [It was important to the United
States European combatant commander and the commanding general Estonian
Self Defense Force that communication with the media specifically
addressed our operation as a security cooperation exercise]{.underline}.
Eighteen countries participated in the exercise, to
[include]{.underline} the United States and Estonia, and [sixteen other
countries that are part of]{.underline} the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization ([NATO]{.underline}). However, [this exercise,]{.underline}
named BALTIC OPERATIONS, [was not officially a NATO
exercise]{.underline}.

[This distinction between security cooperation exercise and NATO
exercise may seem like nothing more than semantics. However a
misunderstanding of the semantic nuances had potential negative
strategic consequences.]{.underline} Estonia shares a border with Russia
and former Soviet military forces occupied Estonia prior to the 1991
Singing Revolution. Diplomatic tensions between Estonia and Russia
remain tense and Estonia is constantly defending its territorial waters
in the Baltic Sea against Russian naval vessels. During the exercise a
Russian frigate and a Russian submarine attempted to violate Estonia's
territorial water. In response, Estonia deployed a small portion of its
Navy to block the Russian vessels and force a return to internationally
recognized neutral waters shared by countries bordering the Baltic Sea.
This level of international tension between Estonia and Russia is
constant. [If the participants of a security cooperation exercise were
to describe the event as a NATO exercise, it would be interpreted by
Russia as a signal that NATO forces, led by the United States, were
rehearsing air, land, and sea strategies in the Baltic Sea that would
support an amphibious assault against the Russian city of St.
Petersburg. This instance and many others like it demonstrate that the
**improper use of military terminology** can have unintended **negative
consequences.**]{.underline}

#### **Violation: The aff is a NATO exercise**

#### Prefer our interpretation:

#### Limits -- condensing the resolution down to a specific area is necessary to match this topic's severe lack of neg positions 

#### Real world education -- the casual use of "security cooperation" as a "NATO exercise" leads to unintended negative consequences

Zayed Al Nahyan and minister for interior and local governments of
Algeria Dahou Ould Kablia signed the agreement in capital city Abu
Dhabi.

In addition to covering cooperation in fighting all kinds of crimes,
including trade in illegal arms and human and drugs trafficking, the
agreement establishes the legal framework and mechanisms of coordination
between the UAE and Algeria in their mutual efforts to combat all kinds
of crime and exchange expertise and information associated with security
issues.

Furthermore, the agreement also calls for formulating a joint committee
to follow up on the security partnership\'s progress.

Security Cooperation

While this term was the product of the 1997 Defense Reform Initiative,
and entered the DoD lexicon with the renaming of DSAA to DSCA in October
1998,14 [security cooperation remained ill-defined until 9 June 2004,
when it was first formally defined within Joint Publication
1-02:]{.underline}

[**All DoD interactions with foreign defense establishments** to build
defense relationships that promote specific U.S. security interests,
develop allied and friendly military capabilities for self-defense and
multinational operations, and provide U.S. forces with peacetime and
contingency access to a host nation.]{.underline}

[That broad definition has continued to take shape, with 10 U.S.C. Ch.
16 § 301 currently defining security cooperation programs and activities
of the DoD as meaning any program, activity (including an exercise), or
interaction of the DoD with the security establishment of a foreign
country to achieve a purpose as follows]{.underline}: build and develop
allied and friendly security capabilities for self-defense and
multinational operations; to provide the armed forces with access to the
foreign country during peacetime or a contingency operation; to build
relationships that promote specific U.S. security interests. 6

[Department of Defense Directive 5132.03, reissued on 29 December 2016,
includes a definition of SC in conformity with the underlying U.S. Code
provision, and, like the current definition for SA, specifies that SA is
included within SC:]{.underline}

[Security Cooperation. **All DoD interactions** with foreign defense
establishments to build defense relationships that promote specific U.S.
security interests, develop allied and partner nation military and
security capabilities for self-defense and multinational operations, and
provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency access to allied and
partner nations. This also includes DoD-administered security assistance
programs.]{.underline}

This definition received an additional minor modification in the 23 May
2017, Joint Publication 3-20, Security Cooperation, replacing the word
\"defense\" relationships with \"security\" relationships.

According to DSCA, [security cooperation refers to those **activities
undertaken by the Department of Defense** to encourage and enable
international partners to work with the United States to achieve
strategic objectives. It includes all DOD interactions with foreign
defense and security establishments, including all DOD-administered
security assistance programs]{.underline} that (1) build defense and
security relationships that promote specific U.S. security interests,
including all international armaments cooperation activities and
security assistance activities; (2) develop allied and friendly military
capabilities for self-defense and multinational operations; and (3)
provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency access to host
nations.15 Security cooperation is a core aspect of DOD\'s key planning
processes, to include the Guidance for the Employment of the Force and
Guidance for the Development of the Force.16

Build the Security Capacity of Partner States: Since the United States
assumed the role of a leading security provider after the end of World
War II, [DOD has worked actively to build the defense capacity of allied
and partner states. Doing so has also given the U.S. Armed Forces
opportunities to train with and learn from their
counterparts]{.underline}. These efforts further the U.S. objective of
securing a peaceful and cooperative international order. [Security
cooperation activities include bilateral and multilateral training and
exercises, foreign military sales (FMS) and financing (FMF), officer
exchange programs, educational opportunities at professional military
schools, technical exchanges, and efforts to assist foreign security
forces in building competency and capacity]{.underline}. In today\'s
complex and interdependent security environment, these dimensions of the
U.S. defense strategy have never been more important. [U.S. forces,
therefore, will continue to treat the building of partners\' security
capacity as an increasingly important mission. Within the range of
security cooperation activities, the most dynamic in the coming years
will be security force assistance (SFA) missions: \"hands on\" efforts,
conducted primarily in host countries, to train, equip, advise, and
assist those countries\' forces in becoming more proficient at providing
security to their populations and protecting their resources and
territories]{.underline}. In order to ensure that improvements in
partner security forces are sustained, the Department must seek to
enhance the capabilities and capacity of security institutions, such as
defense ministries, that support fielded forces\....246 \[emphasis

### 2NC\-\--SC -- Excludes Hostilities

#### Security cooperation is a means to prevent armed conflicts, [not to resolve them]{.underline} \-\-- Afghanistan proves

Studies, "Security Cooperation Poorly Defined", 12/12/2011, The
University of San Francisco,
https://repository.usfca.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&context=thes

Currently [a foreign policy that points to the doctrinal use of SC as
the means of achieving U.S. foreign policy goals does not exist. A U.S.
foreign policy that draws from defensive liberalism is an ideal way to
shape the proper employment of a SC strategy]{.underline}. The National
Security Strategy [(NSS) is the first place where security cooperation
emerges as a means to achieve security goals and the placement of SC in
the NSS is appropriate]{.underline}; however, without a clear
understanding of the definition of security cooperation, the DOD and DOS
are improperly executing SC activities. [The most visible SC strategy,
executed improperly, is the PRT in Afghanistan.]{.underline}131 The use
of SC as a means to achieve post reconstruction goals improperly aligns
means and ends. [SC is designed as a **means to prevent armed conflict
not as a means to resolve the conflict** at the conclusion of
hostilities.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--SC -- Excludes States (for DoS CP)

#### Security cooperation activities are [purely federal]{.underline}

Options for Congress", 08/15/2011, Congressional Research Service,
<https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R41957.pdf> /lg

A final area in which the SPP differs from active component security
cooperation activities lies in the role of individual states in the
relationship. Active component [security cooperation activities are
**purely federal in nature**; there is **no connection with any U.S.
state**]{.underline}. SPP activities have both a federal and a state
connection, and this latter relationship can be important from several
perspectives. For the state and the foreign nation, the SPP provides a
link between senior state and foreign nation officials. The adjutant
general (the head of a state National Guard) is typically a senior
official in his or her state government, normally heading up the state
department of military affairs, and sometimes leading the state
department of emergency management or homeland security.16 This can
provide a conduit for the state and the foreign nation to develop
relationships beyond that with the state National Guard---for example,
enhancing economic ties or conducting educational exchanges. From the
federal perspective, a strong relationship between a state and a foreign
nation could potentially contribute to a stronger relationship between
the United States and the foreign nation.17 On the other hand, conflicts
of interest could conceivably develop between the state and the United
States in their relationships with the partner nation.18

### SC\-\--AT: Excludes Civilians

#### Security Cooperation includes the use of armed forces and [civilian employees]{.underline} of the DoD 

Army LT. General Charles **Hooper 18**, Director of Defense Security
Cooperation Agency, "THE CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
HOLDS A DISCUSSION ON STRENGTHENING ALLIANCES AND PARTNERSHIPS THROUGH
DEFENSE COOPERATION", 03/16/2018, Political Transcript Wire /lg

Last year DSCA created a workforce development directorate to focus on
these efforts and among the accomplishments, what we\'re \-- what we\'re
trying to do is determine the scope of the Security Cooperation
Workforce, something we have never done before, create a DOD wide
defense competency assessment tool and develop revised education and
training curriculum and a competency-based certification program.

And all of this is relatively new. The first thing we did was identify
DOD personnel performing duties related to security cooperation and
believe it or not, we had never done that before. So, we initially
considered the Security Cooperation Workforce to be around 10,000
people.

The majority of which are Title 22 funded. However, [since the expanded
F.Y. \'17 NDAA definition of Security Cooperation Workforce includes I
am quoting here, \"other members of the Armed Forces and **civilian
employees of the DOD** who contribute significantly to the Security
Cooperation programs and activities\".]{.underline}

When we took that into account the number of Security Cooperation
workers increased to over 18,000 people worldwide. Now this sounds like
a lot but when you consider that it includes the implementing agencies,
the Army, Navy, Air Force agencies that work for us, our Security
Cooperation\'s personnel worldwide and the various other personnel in
other departments that are focused on security cooperation, it does not
seem like as much after all.

[Moving forward workforce analysis will be a recurring function to
ensure the DOD provides training and experience-based opportunities
necessary to develop and maintain Security Cooperation\'s related
competencies in the work \-- competencies in the workforce.]{.underline}

[This will ensure that the department has a Security Cooperation
Workforce that can \-- that is approved certified and has the capacity
in both personnel and skills to properly performance its missions,
provides appropriate support to the assessment, planning, monitoring,
execution and evaluation of Security Cooperation.]{.underline}

[Congress has several avenues of influence in the design,
implementation, and oversight of U.S. security cooperation activities.
**Congress determines which activities and operations will be
conducted**, and it provides input on the selection of recipient
countries, organizations, and groups]{.underline}. It defines the
division of labor between DOD, the State Department, and other agencies,
including specifying the modes of interagency collaboration. It
determines the levels of assistance and appropriates funds. In addition,
[**Congress sets conditions** on how the funds may be used and, through
its committees, oversees security cooperation activities by instituting
reporting and assessment requirements.]{.underline}

[DOD uses an overarching term, "Security Cooperation," to denote the
**State Department security assistance** administered by DSCA as well as
all other DOD "interactions with foreign defense establishments to build
defense relationships]{.underline}." This term addresses the lack of
common terminology for DOD's many noncombat activities and contacts,
including not only the provision of defense articles and services, but
also humanitarian assistance, exercises, and military-tomilitary
contacts that benefit both U.S. and foreign forces. [These
"interactions" include programs to provide defense articles and services
to foreign governments for which Congress provides DOD with specific
authority, as well as programs and military exercises conducted under
DOD's organic Title 10 authority]{.underline}

#### Security cooperation is shared between the DoD and DoS

While **[security cooperation is a shared effort between DOD and
DOS]{.underline}**, DOD has, by a significant margin, the preponderance
of personnel and organizational structure that comprise the security
cooperation infrastructure. DOD defines security cooperation as "all DOD
interactions with foreign defense and security establishments to build
defense relationships that promote specific US security interests,
develop allied and friendly military and security capabilities for
internal and external defense and multinational operations, and provide
U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency access to the HN \[host
nation\]."14 It is important to note that the DOD definition includes
developmental and humanitarian assistance activities focused on
enhancing foreign governments' abilities to care for their people. The
goal of all these activities is to reduce or eliminate factors leading
to a crisis or conflict that requires U.S. intervention.15 [Security
assistance activities are a subset of security cooperation and deal
principally with foreign military financing (FMF), foreign military
sales (FMS), and international military education and training (IMET)
activities]{.underline}. The Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Policy
has overall responsibility for the execution of DOD's security
cooperation activities, which DSCA administers.

#### Security cooperation includes DoD-administered security assistance under [DoS authority]{.underline}

While all [of the programs previously mentioned are authorized under 22
U.S.C, or Title 22, and are under the **general control of the
Department of State** (DoS)]{.underline}, the Department of Defense
(DoD) administers many of them. [Since Title 10 U.S. Code Section 301
defines security cooperation programs and activities of DoD as any
program or interaction of DoD with the security establishment of a
foreign country to build capabilities, to provide access or to build
relationships, many of the previously described FAA and AECA-authorized
security assistance programs administered by DoD in accordance with the
SAMM **fall under the broad definition of security
cooperation**]{.underline}. The following is a categorization of

In order to understand what is meant by [[security
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} it is necessary to break down this
concept into its components. [Security tends to have one of two
meanings. On the one hand, it refers to the condition of feeling and
being secure]{.underline},13 which is achieved when states and
individuals enjoy freedom from fear (i.e. negative peace) and want
(comprehensive human security). On the other hand security [[refers
to]{.mark} a particular **[form of politics]{.mark}**, to wit the high
politics of security [that]{.mark} may [involve]{.mark} an
[extraordinary policy response]{.mark}]{.underline}, or at least the
credible threat thereof. Importantly, [[security politics]{.mark} may or
may not lead to greater overall security as, in Jonathan Herington\'s14
terms, 'a [state of being']{.mark}]{.underline}, but -- for the most
part -- security action is motivated by the idea to achieve or increase
security as a state of being in international society. Depending on the
type and nature of the threat, this may or may not involve the use of
military force.15 [In [security cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline},
security thus [[refers to]{.mark} defensive [actions aimed at ensuring
security as a **state of being.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

that an attack against one member state is an attack against them all.

That article placed Western Europe under U.S. protection in the face of
a Soviet Union that was cementing its domination over Central and
Eastern Europe and appeared then only to be growing in power and
ambition.

After the Soviet Union's collapse in the early 1990s, the alliance took
on a wider role. NATO forces --- made up of troops volunteered by member
states --- operated as peacekeepers in Bosnia in the 1990s, and bombed
Serbia in 1999 to protect Kosovo, where the alliance still has troops.

[[Alliance, partnership]{.mark}, partnership, alliance.]{.underline} It
seems like those terms are used interchangeably by Defense Department
officials in every other speech. [However, those [officials]{.mark} are
**[choos]{.mark}ing their [words carefully]{.mark}**, because in the
world of international relations, [**alliances and partnerships**
are]{.mark} two **[very different]{.mark} things**. ]{.underline}

Alliances

[[Alliances are **formal agreements**]{.mark} between two or more
nations]{.underline}. In national defense, they\'re promises that each
nation will support the other, particularly during war.

[Some examples of alliances that the U.S. is in **[include NATO
]{.mark}**]{.underline}--- the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (with
28 other countries), NORAD --- the North American Aerospace Defense
Command (with Canada), ANZUS --- the Australia, New Zealand and U.S.
Security Treaty, and the Moroccan-American Treaty of Friendship ---
which is America\'s oldest unbroken treaty. 

Treaties are the documents that seal the deal on alliances, so sometimes
you might hear the term \"treaty ally.\" Things like international
boundaries, trade rules, human rights and even postal arrangements can
also be set by treaties.

Some treaties make room for alliances to grow. For example, the Atlantic
Treaty, which founded NATO, says that membership is open to any
\"European state in a position to further the principles of this treaty
and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area.\"

And in fact, the newly named nation of North Macedonia is well on its
way to doing just that. The formal approval protocol is awaiting
signatures from the 29 nations in NATO, a process that's expected to
wrap up by the end of this year or early next year.

Partnerships

[[Partnerships are **less formal**]{.mark} **than**
alliances]{.underline}. Often called \"strategic partnerships,\" they
help build relationships between nations or organizations like
militaries. Like alliances, they benefit the members of the partnership,
but they can be short-term and don\'t involve a treaty.

[[NATO has nine "partners across the globe" or "global partners", which
the Alliance cooperates with]{.mark} on an individual basis. NATO's
global partners include **Afghanistan**, **Australia**, **Colombia**,
**Iraq**, **Japan**, **the Republic of Korea**, **Mongolia**, **New
Zealand** and **Pakistan**. NATO['s engagement with global partners is
taking on **increasing importance**]{.mark} in a complex security
environment, [where]{.mark} many of the challenges [the Alliance]{.mark}
faces are **[global]{.mark}** and **no longer bound by
geography.**]{.underline}

[[The NATO **2030 agenda**]{.mark} agreed by NATO Leaders at the NATO
Brussels 2021 Summit [seeks to **strengthen NATO's** ]{.mark}**global
[cooperation with]{.mark} like-minded partners, especially with its
[global partners]{.mark}**, to defend the rules-based international
order and institutions, to set international norms and standards in
space and **[in cyberspace, and on new technologies]{.mark}** and global
arms control.]{.underline}

[[Since 2016, NATO has increasingly engaged]{.mark} politically
[with]{.mark} its four Asia-Pacific [partners]{.mark}]{.underline} --
Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea and New Zealand -- notably
through meetings of the North Atlantic Council, including a first
meeting at the level of foreign ministers in December 2020, to discuss
the shift in the global balance of power and the rise of China.

NATO is also intensifying dialogue and cooperation with Colombia.

[**[Global partners have access to the full range of activities NATO
offers]{.mark}** to all partners guided by an Individual Partnership
Cooperation Programme. [They work with NATO on a range of]{.mark} common
**cross-cutting security [challenges]{.mark}** [such as **cyber
defence**]{.mark}, **counter-terrorism**, **non-proliferation** and
**resilience**.]{.underline}

[Some **[partners participate in]{.mark} NATO's [military
operations]{.mark}**,]{.underline} while many have benefited from NATO's
expertise in areas such as building defence capacity, and defence
training and education.

NATO also consults with other non-member countries, which have no
bilateral programme of cooperation (for example, China, Brazil, Ghana,
India, Singapore) in particular on regional security dynamics.

[[At]{.mark} the NATO [Brussels]{.mark} Summit in June 2021, [Allies
agreed to **strengthen**]{.mark} **NATO [engagement ]{.mark}**[with key
global actors]{.mark}]{.underline} and other new interlocutors beyond
the Euro-Atlantic area, including those from Africa, Asia and Latin
America.

Wider cooperation

[In today's **complex security environment**, NATO['s relations with
partners]{.mark} across the globe [offers **many advantages**]{.mark} to
Allies and partners alike.]{.underline} NATO's practical cooperation
with its global partners includes cross-cutting global challenges such
as cyber defence, maritime security, humanitarian assistance and
disaster relief, non-proliferation, defence science and technology, and
Women, Peace and Security. Some partners participate in NATO's military
operations, while many have also benefited from NATO's expertise in
areas such as building defence capacity, and defence training and
education.

Political consultation and intelligence-sharing is fundamental to the
way NATO works with its global partners, just as it is among the 30
Allies. Political dialogue is a key tool for fostering regional
understanding and exchanging expertise between Allies and their global
partners. This enriches NATO's situational awareness in areas beyond its
direct neighbourhood, and it ensures that global partners understand
NATO's positions and are able to contribute to policy discussions on
common security challenges. This is increasing in importance as many of
today's new security challenges are no longer bound by geography, such
as in cyber space, space and climate change. Political dialogue also
assists in establishing and developing practical cooperation with these
partners.

Political dialogue with NATO's global partners take place in many
different formats, including at NATO Headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.
Just as Allied consultations take place in a broad range of committees
and at different levels, so too do several global partners participate
in these committees on a regular basis, from the level of ministers to
technical working groups. For example, NATO's four Asia-Pacific partners
-- Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea and New Zealand --
participate on a regular basis in discussions in the Political Committee
and in the North Atlantic Council.

At the most senior level, the Secretary General, the Deputy Secretary
General, the Chair of the Military Committee and NATO's Strategic
Commanders meet with global partners' Heads of State and Government,
foreign ministers, defence ministers, as well as other high-level
officials.

Support for NATO-led operations

[The **[support provided by global partners]{.mark}** and other
countries **to NATO-led operations** [has made a significant
contribution]{.mark} to **international peace and
security.**]{.underline}

In Afghanistan, a number of global partners such as Australia, the
Republic of Korea and New Zealand, made important contributions to the
NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) from 2003 to
2014. Many continued to work alongside Allies in the follow-on Resolute
Support Mission to train, advise and assist the Afghan security forces
and institutions. Some countries supported stabilisation efforts in
Afghanistan without being involved in combat. This includes Japan, which
funded a large number of development projects and dispatched liaison
officers, and Pakistan that provided ground and air lines of
communication to resupply the mission . In 2020, the Republic of Korea
served as the co-chair of the Afghan National Army Trust Fund Board.

Evolution of relations

[[NATO has **maintained a dialogue**]{.mark} with **countries that are
not part of its partnership frameworks**, on an ad-hoc basis, [since
the]{.mark} 19**[90s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, NATO's involvement
in areas outside of its immediate region -- including Afghanistan and
Libya -- has increased the need and opportunities for enhanced global
interaction. Clearly, the emergence of global threats requires the
cooperation of a wider range of countries to successfully tackle
challenges such as terrorism, proliferation, piracy or cyber attacks.
Dialogue with these countries can also help NATO avert crises and, when
needed, manage an operation throughout all phases.

Since 1998, NATO [[has invited **countries**]{.mark} **across the
globe** [to participate in its]{.mark} **activities, workshops,
exercises and [conferences]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This decision marked
a policy shift for the Alliance, allowing these countries to have
access, through the case-by-case approval of the North Atlantic Council,
to activities offered under NATO's structured partnerships. These
countries were known as "Contact Countries".

Significant steps were taken at the 2006 Riga Summit to increase the
operational relevance of NATO's cooperation with countries that are part
of its structured partnership frameworks as well as other countries
around the world. These steps, reinforced by decisions at the 2008
Bucharest Summit, defined a set of objectives for these relationships
and created avenues for enhanced political dialogue, including meetings
of the North Atlantic Council with ministers of the countries concerned,
high-level talks, and meetings with ambassadors. In addition, annual
work programmes (then referred to as Individual Tailored Cooperation
Packages of Activities) were further developed.

At the 2010 Lisbon Summit, Allies agreed to develop a more efficient and
flexible partnership policy, in time for the meeting of Allied foreign
ministers in Berlin in April 2011. To this end, they decided to:

streamline NATO's partnership tools in order to open all cooperative
activities and exercises to partners and to harmonise partnership
programmes;

better engage with partners across the globe who contribute
significantly to security and reach out to relevant partners to build
trust, increase transparency and develop practical cooperation;

develop flexible formats to discuss security challenges with partners
and enhance existing fora for political dialogue; and

build on improvements in NATO's training mechanisms and consider methods
to enhance individual partners' ability to build capacity.

Following the 2010 Lisbon Summit and NATO's subsequent revision of its
partnership policy in April 2011, the global context has changed
significantly. As NATO became increasingly confronted with new defence
and security challenges such as cyber attacks, disinformation,
disruptive technologies and the erosion of arms control regimes, NATO
recognised the importance of adapting to these new security challenges,
including working closer together with NATO's partners.

This increasing engagement with NATO's like-minded partners, regardless
of geographic location, on the basis of the shared values of democratic
freedoms, rule of law and human rights, allows Allies to discuss
relevant developments in the regions with partners, and increase their
situational awareness and understanding of strategic issues on relevant
global developments.

[In June 2020, NATO Secretary General Jens [Stoltenberg]{.mark} launched
his [outline for NATO **2030**]{.mark}. In order for NATO to keep its
Allies safe in a more uncertain world, the Secretary General stated that
NATO [must]{.mark} "stay strong militarily, be more united politically,
and [take a **broader approach globally**]{.mark}." NATO taking a more
global approach means **[work]{.mark}**ing even more **[closely with
like-minded partners]{.mark}**]{.underline} to develop coherent, strong,
unified and collective responses to defend our values in a world of
increased global competition.

The global pillar of NATO 2030 is particularly relevant to NATO's
engagement with its four Asia-Pacific partners -- Australia, Japan, the
Republic of Korea and New Zealand. As the challenges confronting the
Euro-Atlantic area and the Asia-Pacific region are increasingly
converging, it is vital for NATO and its four close partners in the
Asia-Pacific region to enhance cooperation and dialogue to support
security in both regions, but also to work together to strengthen the
international rules-based order. In December 2020, for the first time,
the four Asia-Pacific partners participated in a NATO Foreign
Ministerial Meeting, where NATO Allies discussed the shift in the global
balance of power and the rise of China with the Asia-Pacific partners,
as well as with Finland, Sweden and the European Union High
Representative/ Vice President of the European Commission.

[At the **2021 Brussels Summit**, [Allies]{.mark} agreed to
[increase]{.mark} dialogue and **practical cooperation between NATO and
existing partners**, including partners in the Asia-Pacific, and to
**strengthen NATO [engagement]{.mark}** [with **key global
actors**]{.mark} and other new interlocutors beyond the Euro-Atlantic
area, including from Africa, Asia and Latin America.]{.underline}

of NATO and its Personnel during Military Operations\",

Chapter 5, accessed 7-8-2022 \\\\SYang

This chapter examined the existence of [**[i]{.mark}nternational
[l]{.mark}egal [p]{.mark}ersonality** [of NATO]{.mark}. **Legal
personality** [is relevant]{.mark} to the responsibility of
NATO]{.underline} and its personnel during military operations. Without
international legal personality, NATO cannot be responsible.
Unfortunately, there is little jurisprudence on the concept of
international legal personality. In 1949, the ICJ formed an Opinion on
the personality of the un, but remained vague on how this was
determined. This resulted in various theories on how legal personality
is acquired. [The two **mainstream theories in [academic
literature]{.mark}** are the '**subjective theory'** and '**objective
theory'**,]{.underline} which both give explanations on how
international legal personality can be determined to exist, but also
have received criticism. The practical approach of Klabbers'
'presumptive personality' reconciles to some degree both theories.88
This theory [[presumes the **existence of i**]{.mark}**nternational
[l]{.mark}egal [p]{.mark}ersonality** of an international organization
[if **it performs acts**]{.mark} that can only be [explained on the
**basis of**]{.mark} **international legal
[personality]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This chapter has examined NATO's
legal personality on the basis of the two mainstream theories, but also
inclined towards the 'presumptive theory' to give a practical answer.
[[Some]{.mark} authors [doubt]{.mark} whether the Alliance has legal
personality]{.underline}.89 These authors argue that NATO has not acted
on the international level. The often-used example in this respect is
the compensation by the us (in lieu to NATO) to China for the damages
suffered during NATO's intervention in Kosovo. Other arguments denying
the international legal personality of NATO is the fact that NATO takes
its decision by consensus, leading to believe that the Alliance does not
have any "will" of its own. [[These]{.mark} doubts [would be]{.mark} to
some degree [valid]{.mark}, if the focus was on the **earlier years of
the NATO. [During the Cold War]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- and probably
during its first non-article 5 operation as well -- it may have been
difficult to consider that the Alliance has international legal
personality. NATO's static defence operations against the former Soviet
Union did not require an autonomous role separate from its member
States. The member States were fully capable to independently devise
military plans and coordinate these with each other. [[The
**establishment of SACEUR**]{.mark} in 1952, which integrated military
forces, [marked the **beginning of a
transformation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but NATO started to evolve into
an organization with legal personality only after the Cold War. Since
then, [[the Alliance]{.mark} has [gone through a **significant
transformation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as described in Chapters 3 and 4.
The Organization has [[concluded **international agreements** with
**States**]{.mark} **and other international
organizations**]{.underline}. NATO and its personnel enjoy privileges
and immunities in its member States, but also in Afghanistan, Iraq, in
the States of the former Yugoslavia and in various other mission areas.
It should not be ruled out that the Alliance might bring and receive
international claims in the future if the exercise of the jurisdiction
by the courts would be made possible. [[It is not required that
an]{.mark} international **[org]{.mark}**anization [show all the
indicia]{.mark} of **international legal personality**. [If this were
the case, **barely any**]{.mark} international **[org]{.mark}**anization
[would]{.mark} [have]{.mark} such [status]{.mark} in international law.
**[NATO]{.mark} is presumed to have international legal personality** on
the basis of the fact that it has [concluded **international
agreements** and]{.mark} that the **organization and its personnel**
[enjoy **privileges**]{.mark} **and immunities**.]{.underline} This
presumption may be rebutted if there is evidence to the contrary.
[Practice of [States and international
**org**]{.mark}anization**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as well as the
jurisprudence of international courts and tribunals, [[confirm]{.mark}
the presumption [that **NATO has i**]{.mark}**nternational
[l]{.mark}egal [p]{.mark}ersonality**]{.underline}. The military
intervention in the former Yugoslavia gave rise to several claims for
damages resulting from NATO military operations. Yugoslavia filed
complaints against several member States of NATO, while individuals
turned their claims for damages to individual member States of NATO
instead to NATO itself.90 The respondent States in both cases argued
that the claims should have been filed against NATO -- on the basis of
that it had international legal personality -- instead of the individual
nations. These early cases are not indicative of either the existence or
non-existence of international legal personality, but of the absence of
NATO's locus standi in the courts. Claimants may have chosen to start
their proceedings against individual States, so to avoid their claim
being regarded non-admissible. International courts and tribunals have
confirmed NATO's legal personality. Both the ICTY and the ICC came to
this conclusion in relation to NATO operations in respectively the
Balkans and Libya. International organizations, including [**[the
UN]{.mark}, have [addressed NATO]{.mark}** in relation to alleged
breaches of **international obligations binding upon the
organization**]{.underline}. The UN International Commission of Inquiry,
notably, addressed NATO -- and not individual member States -- with
respect to airstrikes in Libya that may have caused incidental loss of
civilian life and damage to civilian infrastructure.91 Finally,
[**[States]{.mark} have [confirmed]{.mark} NATO's [legal
personality]{.mark}** [in the]{.mark} ILC's commentary to the
**[A]{.mark}**rticles on **[R]{.mark}**esponsibility of
**[I]{.mark}**nternational **[O]{.mark}**rganizations]{.underline},
where they stated that "NATO is an international organization within the
meaning of draft article 2(a) of the draft articles, and as such a
subject of international law. It possesses international legal
personality as well as treaty-making power".92 The scepticism regarding
the international legal personality of NATO diminished gradually from
the 1990s. Academic writers, States and international organization
increasingly argue in favour of the Alliance' status under international
law. [[Even **NATO itself**]{.mark} had to become **[convinced of
its]{.mark} own [personality]{.mark}**. The **out-of-area operations
required** the conclusion of Status of Force Agreements **(SOFAs) with
third States**]{.underline}. NATO aptly took the initiative and
concluded SOFAs with Bosnia-Herzegovina, Afghanistan, Libya and other
countries, thereby affirming its status in international law. In
conclusion, [[NATO]{.mark} certainly **[meets]{.mark} several
[indicia]{.mark}** of international legal personality as is evidenced by
its **performance of actions** on the international level]{.underline},
notably treaty-making power and privileges and immunities. [The
**existence of international legal personality** is -- in a way -- also
[confirmed by]{.mark} the practice of **[States]{.mark} and other
international organizations**. Recent [academic **lit**]{.mark}erature
**[further]{.mark}**more [supports]{.mark} this conclusion.]{.underline}

functions is in section 10 of the 1999 Strategic Concept of the
organization.\'? [The [**organization exercises powers** on the
**international plane**]{.mark}]{.underline}, notably treaty-making
power. [**Article 25 of [the]{.mark} 1951 [Ottawa treaty]{.mark}** on

**N**]{.mark}orth **[A]{.mark}**tlantic **[C]{.mark}**ouncil acting on
behalf of the organization [may conclude **supplementary
agreements**]{.mark} **with member states**.]{.underline} The
organization also concludes international agreements on other issues
with member states\" and with non-member states.\" [There is
[also]{.mark} **[state practice]{.mark}** supporting **legal
personality** of the **organization**.]{.underline} In the Banliouic
case before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR[) [the **French
government** argued]{.mark}]{.underline} that a bombardment during
Operation Allied Force was not imputable to its member states but to
[[**NATO as an organization** with an **i**]{.mark}nternational
**[l]{.mark}**egal **[p]{.mark}**ersonality [**separate** from]{.mark}
that of the **[respondent states]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The challenge
of the admissibility of the case by all the respondent states on the
ground that the ECHR would be determining the rights and obligations of
NATO itself also points in this direction. This challenge [assumes that
[NATO itself has **rights**]{.mark} **and obligations** under
**international law,** which can only be the case if the organization
has **international legal personality**]{.underline}. Trial Chambers of
the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)
have also treated NATO as an international legal person separate from
its member states. Trial Chamber I in the Todorovic case ordered the NAC
to disclose to the defense copies of documents and the identity of
certain individuals in connection with the arrest of the accused.\" The
order was based on article 29 of the ICTY Statute which provides that
states shall cooperate with the Tribunal. The Trial Chamber stated that:
A purposive construction of the Statute yields the conclusion that such
an order should be as applicable to collective enterprises of States as
it is to individual States; Article 29 should, therefore, be read as
conferring on the International Tribunal a power to require an
international organization or its competent organ such as SFOR to
cooperate with it in the achievement of its fundamental objective of
prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of
international humanitarian law, by providing the several modes of
assistance set out therein.?\" In the Legality of the Use of Force cases

that NATO is an international legal person during the hearings held in
April 2004. **[[Portugal]{.underline}]{.mark}** drew attention to

technological, logistic and infrastructure resources in the military
sphere, [[without]{.mark} being able to rely on **external

factual deficiency arguably [makes **i**]{.mark}nternational

This chapter describes [the current **institutional framework of NATO**
and the **decision making process** for its operations]{.underline}.
This will provide [further [understanding of]{.mark}]{.underline} the
powers of NATO and [[the **relationship between NATO and**]{.mark} **the
[member States]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which is relevant for the
question of attribution of conduct of personnel to NATO, troop
contributing nations or other international organizations such as the
UN. Moreover, the overview provides in insight on whether [[NATO **is an
entity**]{.mark} **[separate from its member States]{.mark}**, i.e.
whether [it **meets the indicia of**]{.mark} **an international
organization** with **[i]{.mark}**nternational **[l]{.mark}**egal
**[p]{.mark}**ersonality]{.underline}. The conclusions in this chapter
will be used further on in Chapters 5 and 7. Paragraph 4.2 gives a brief
outline of the various organs of the Alliance, their composition, tasks
and their position within the NATO structure. The intention of providing
this outline is to facilitate understanding of the political-military
structure and how hierarchically NATO is organised. Paragraph 4.3
examines the relationship between NATO and its member States and NATO's
decision-making process. [Since the North Atlantic Council (**NAC**), in
which all the **member States participate**, is the highest political
**decision-making organ of NATO,** it is appropriate to [examine]{.mark}
both the relationship between **NATO and States** as well as **[NATO's
decision-making process]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is important to
discuss the decision-making process in the NAC to establish to whom a
wrongful act can be attributed: to NATO, to its member States or to
both. [It can also [assist in establishing]{.mark} in which situations
-- i.]{.underline}e. under which conditions -- NATO member States and /
or NATO as an international organization will be held responsible. This
paragraph will, additionally[, **examine [the relationship]{.mark}**
between NATO and non-NATO member States,]{.underline} for the same
reasons as indicated above and because non-member States regularly
participate in NATO-led operations. The outline is followed by an
analysis of the relationship between NATO and the UN. The choice to
limit the analysis to the relationship between NATO and the UN is made
in order to avoid an overly generic or exhaustive study on relationships
between NATO and other international organizations or such organizations
in general. Moreover, the relationship with the UN is the more
straightforward choice to examine as the member States made explicit
reference in the Washington Treaty to the context and position NATO
takes within the UN system. The context is established by referring to
Article 51 of the UN Charter -- the right to take collective action
against an armed attack -- which forms the basis for the establishment
of NATO. The Washington Treaty also acknowledges the primary role of the
UN Security Council in the maintenance and restoration of international
peace and security. Moreover, since NATO relies for its non-article 5
crisis response operations -- which consist of the majority of NATO-led
operations -- on a mandate or authorization from the UN Security
Council, the relationship between NATO and the UN is of relevance here.
Finally, from a practical point of view, the UN is likely one of the
most important partners of NATO. 4.2 Current Institutional Framework of
NATO 4.2.1 Introduction NATO consists of two main types of institutional
structures: a civilian structure and a military structure. The civilian
structure is responsible for policy- and decision-making which provides
for the functioning of the Organization both internally and externally.
The military structure is involved in the planning and execution of
military operations. All NATO operations are decided upon by the
civilian structure and carried out by military structure. It means that
both parts of NATO participate in the initiation, planning and execution
of NATO operations. 4.2.2 The Civilian Structure a The North Atlantic
Council The Washington Treaty stands out for its brevity, with a mere 14
articles and does expand a great deal on the structure, tasks and
responsibilities of the Alliance. The treaty establishes only one organ,
the North Atlantic Council (NAC), and attributes the necessary powers to
implement the treaty.1 The NAC is the highest decision-making organ in
the Organization. The Council is composed of the representatives of all
Member States, which holds regular meetings at the level of Foreign- or
Defence Ministers (Ministerials), Heads of States (Summits) or Permanent
Representatives. As such, [**[the NAC]{.mark} is the most important
organ** for the member States to express their views]{.underline} and to
take collective decisions on political issues of the Alliance. [This
feature [is **of relevance to determine**]{.mark} whether NATO has
**[i]{.mark}**nternational **[l]{.mark}**egal **[p]{.mark}**ersonality.
An **indication that an international organization has international
legal personality** is]{.underline} -- according to the theory of
'objective legal personality' which is further described in Chapter 5 --
[that an organization is **not subject to the authority of any other
State** or organised community. [Since]{.mark} the **[NAC is not subject
to]{.mark} the authority** of]{.underline} [**[a]{.mark}**nother
**[legal entity]{.mark}** other than the participating States, the
assumption is that **[NATO has i]{.mark}nternational [l]{.mark}egal
[p]{.mark}ersonality**.]{.underline}2 The Washington Treaty does not
prescribe the way the Council should take its decisions, but the NAC
adopted consensus as the standard. This translates to decisions being
adopted without a formal voting procedure, provided that no member
raises any formal objection.3 The decision-making process of NATO is
described more elaborately when this book examines the relationship
between the member States and NATO in paragraph 4.3. It is relevant to
note here that decision-making through consensus is both seen as an
argument in favour and against the existence of international legal
personality of the Alliance. Arguments against such personality put
emphasis on the fact that NAC decisions are collective decisions made by
its member States, which assumes that the NAC expresses the will of the
member States, rather than the Organization. On the other hand, member
States have a right to express objections that they may have and block
any decision, making the NAC's decisions entirely reliant on the common
agreement of all member States, rather than that of one State. [The
introduction of [the "**silence procedure**"]{.mark}]{.underline} and
opting-out mechanism **[[enhances the autonomy]{.mark} of the
Organization]{.underline}** -- referred to later in this chapter -- [and
alludes to the possibility that [NATO]{.mark} may [have a **volonté
distincte**]{.mark} from its member States]{.underline}. A volonté
distincte, or 'separate will', may [[indicate]{.mark} under certain
**legal theories** that the Organization has **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[l]{.mark}**egal **[p]{.mark}**ersonality]{.underline}. It is held
here that the consensus rule on itself is not an indicator of either the
existence or non-existence of international legal personality. Rather,
[a more [**distinguishing factor** is]{.mark} to examine in [how]{.mark}
far [the member States retain control]{.mark} in the decision-making
process taken by the NAC]{.underline}. A conclusion on the existence of
international legal personality of the Alliance will be given in Chapter
5. The Washington Treaty does not prescribe the span of topics which the
NAC can decide upon. The Council's authority is generally confined to
the aim of NATO, which is to "safeguard the freedom, common heritage and
civilization of their peoples" and to "promote stability and well-being
in the North-Atlantic Area". In that respect, [[the]{.mark} Washington
[Treaty leaves **ample room for interpretation**]{.mark}]{.underline}
and discretion [**in decision-making**.]{.underline}6 The founders have
left to the discretion of the Council to "set up such subsidiary bodies
as may be necessary."7 The NAC created a variety of subsidiary bodies,
of which the most important here are the Secretary General, the Military
Committee and the various organs of the NATO Command Structure. b The
Secretary General [The Secretary General]{.underline} leads a unified
international secretariat to assist the plenary organ -- the NAC -- and
to serve as the Chairman of the Council.8 As such, he [is the chief
executive of NATO and responsible for promoting and directing the
process of consultation and decision-making within the
Alliance]{.underline}.9The Secretary General is supported by the
International Staff, forming the so-called "civilian structure". The
Secretary General is also the representative for external relations. He
maintains relationships on the level of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, -
Defense and Heads of State during the operations.10 The Secretary
General is usually the signatory for international agreements binding
the Alliance, e.g. the exchange of letters with the Afghan authorities
relating to the Status of ISAF Personnel in Afghanistan is signed on the
side of the Alliance by the Secretary General.11 4.2.3 The Military
Structure NATO's military structure consists of the Military Committee,
supported by its International Military Staff, and the NATO Command
Structure. a The Military Committee The Military Committee (MC) is
composed of the highest national military representatives from each
Member State, assisting the Council with military expertise12 and works
under the overall political authority of the NAC.13 It assists and
advises the NAC on military matters and provides military guidance to
the NATO Strategic Commanders of the NATO Command Structure. The MC
takes its decisions by consensus; this way full commitment is achieved
in both the military as well as the political requirements and
objectives of the mission. The MC plays an important role in the
drafting of NATO strategic concepts and advises the Council of the
military situation in countries were NATO is conducting operations. The
role of the Chairman of the MC is to represent and defend the
consensus-based advice to the NAC. The Military Committee is supported
by the International Military Staff. The Committee is an essential link
between the political and military structure of NATO. The Military
Committee provides the NAC with military advice agreed by all Chiefs of
Defence. The consensus among the highest military authorities of NATO
represents a firm commitment that the operation is militarily achievable
with the forces available from the nations. b The NATO Command Structure
The NATO Command Structure consists of two Strategic Commands, Allied
Command Operations and Allied Command Transformation. In 1950, the NAC
created the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR)14 and gave it the
responsibility to "organize \[national units assigned to him\] into an
effective integrated defence force".15 Currently, SACEUR is responsible
for the planning and commanding all NATO-led operations. He is bound by
the political constraints given by the NAC, who maintains political
oversight of operations. The command structure enables NATO to plan and
execute operations while maintaining strategic military and political
coherence throughout the chain of command. SACEUR has at his disposition
various subordinate commands which makes up Allied Command Operations,
or ACO. ACO includes two Joint Force Commands (JFC Brunssum and JFC
Naples), each of which is capable to plan, conduct and sustain a major
joint operation16 at the operational level. There are also three other
specialised commands (Air Command, Land Command and Maritime Command)
directly under SACEUR's command, which provide support to the Joint
Force Command, but are also able to plan, conduct and sustain a smaller
joint operation by themselves and report directly to SACEUR. Supreme
Allied Command Transformation has the lead role for the transformation
of NATO's military structure, forces, capabilities and doctrines in
order to improve the military effectiveness of the Alliance. SACT does
not have a specific role in commanding operations and will not be
further examined in detail as it is not of particular relevance to
NATO's responsibilities during its operations. In NATO-led operations,
SACEUR will appoint one of its subordinate headquarters to plan and
execute the mission (figure 2). One of the Joint Force Commands, or --
in case of a smaller mission, the Maritime-, Land- or Air Command -- can
establish a headquarters in the mission area that will be responsible
for running of day-to-day operations. SACEUR will retain Operational

**[\<\<\<FIGURES 2 AND 3 OMITTED\>\>\>]{.underline}**

Command (i.e. the authority to assign missions or tasks, to deploy units
and to reassign forces)17 over the mission, while delegating Operational
Control (i.e. the authority to direct forces assigned so that the
commander may accomplish specific missions or tasks which are usually
limited by function, time, or location) to the subordinate headquarters
(figure 3).184.3 The Relationship between NATO and Its Member States and
the Decision-making Process There is considerable debate on the status
of NATO in international law. Some view [**[NATO]{.mark} as [an
organization independent from]{.mark} its [members]{.mark}**[, capable
of having a will of its own]{.mark}.]{.underline}19 Other studies see
NATO as a trans-Atlantic forum where member States meet to discuss
global security issues.20 As such, NATO is not capable of acting
independently and would be deprived of international legal personality.
Consequently, if NATO is not a subject of international law, it can not
bear international rights and obligations and does not have
responsibility under international law. Those studies which hold the
view that NATO is a forum or a mere Alliance of like-minded States
rather than an independent international organization, base their
arguments primarily on the process in which member States take decisions
in the North Atlantic Council (NAC). NATO takes decisions by consensus
of all the member States and therefore there is no real autonomy of the
organization. The consensus rule by itself is not an indicator of
international legal personality, as was discussed above. The measure by
which the member States control the organization through this
decision-making procedure is a better indicator for establishing whether
the organization has international legal personality[.]{.underline}21
For this reason, the relationship between NATO and its member States and
the degree in which member States control decisions made by NATO is
further examined below. This chapter will focus on three areas, the
consensus-rule in NATO's decision making, the planning of operations and
the contribution of forces to the Alliance. 4.3.1 Consensus-rule NATO
decisions are made by consensus, after discussion and consultation among
member countries.22 A decision reached by consensus is an agreement
reached by common consent. [It is important to **differentiate** between
**decision-making** based on **consensus and unanimity**.]{.underline}
Unanimity requires an actively stated vote in favour of a measure, which
the Alliance does not seek. Actually, [[there is **no voting**]{.mark}
at all [in **NATO's decision-making**]{.mark} **process**. Instead,
decisions are taken when there is an absence of objection]{.underline}
by any member State. Member States can express their objections either
privately with the Secretary General, raise them during NAC meetings, or
even go public with their disagreement.23 Of course, each choice comes
at a political cost. Hence, the role of the Secretary General is
essential to maintain the cohesion of the Alliance. To this end,
[[the]{.mark} **Secretary General** may employ a tactic called the
"**[silence-procedure]{.mark}**". This procedure [allows States to
**reach consensus**]{.mark} **on those topics that are politically
sensitive**]{.underline} for some of the member States. It entails that
a decision will be automatically passed by the NAC after a stated
time-period set by the Secretary General, unless a member State objects
by sending a formal letter to the Secretary General thereby breaking the
silence.24 In some cases, [the **political cost** for an opposing member
State's representative of openly being identified as blocking the
decision may **outweigh the benefit** of seeing the proposed action
stopped]{.underline}. In those cases, [a member **State**]{.underline}
may prefer not to block the decision, but [rather **mitigate its
concerns through caveats**]{.underline} for its forces or even to choose
not to participate fully in the operation. The silence-procedure has
proven useful in situations where domestic opposition exists in the
member States for a certain military intervention. [In Operation Allied
Force]{.underline}, public disagreement would have placed NATO member
States in a conflict before world media and would play in favour for
President Milosevic. [The silence procedure [allowed **Member States not
needing to take a**]{.mark} **public [position]{.mark}** and permitted
NATO to move forward.25 Similarly, the **silence procedure** provided
Germany]{.underline} -- which faced public opposition regarding a
military intervention in Libya -- [in an **opportunity to avoid to take
publicly a position** regarding]{.underline} the decision in favour of
NATO['s Operation Unified Protector]{.underline}.26 The silence
procedure shows that the Alliance can continue to move forward even with
the dissociation of one or more of the member States. The decision
making procedure is not -- by itself -- an argument that NATO lacks
autonomy and, hence, international legal personality. As stated above,
the autonomy depends on the degree of control that the member States
exercise over the organization. The consensus procedure illustrates that
[there is **no requirement for member States to exercise** such
**control** and thereby [allowing the **Organization**]{.mark} to
**enjoy** a certain **degree of [autonomy]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Member
States are also free to choose which operations they prefer to
participate in. In case a member State has concerns regarding a specific
mission, it may decide not to participate in the mission with military
forces and materiel, while at the same time choose not to block any
decision relating to the operation. In this regard it is also worth
mentioning that in some situations, the Troop Contributing Nations'
involvement in the decision making process is limited to the decision
whether or not to participate with military forces, without having any
role in the formulation of the political aspects of a mission. States
which are not members of NATO may contribute with military forces to a
NATO-led mission. NATO relies extensively on the contribution of forces
from so-called "Non-NATO Contributing Nations (NNCN)". These are States
which are not parties to the Washington Treaty and are not members of
NATO, but are willing to contribute forces to a NATO-led operation. From
the earliest operations, NNCN have contributed to NATO operations in a
substantial manner, notably Russia as the single largest contributor. As
of September 2008, approximately 62,500 personnel were deployed in 5
NATO-led operations of which 4,300 personnel were provided by 16 NNCN.27
The Political Military Framework regulates the participation of NNCN in
NATO operations. The process starts with an expression of interest by
the NNCN in contributing to a specific NATO-led operation. Participation
is dependent upon NAC approval, and, once approved, NNCN enter into
technical agreements with NATO to work out security, technical and
financial issues.28 NNCN will be consulted on all aspects of the
operation, but do not have decision making power on, for instance, the
concept of the operation, rules of engagement and periodic mission
reviews.29 NNCN do not have any political influence on the mission as
they do not take part in the decision making process at the NAC, but to
allow SACEUR to have Operational Command and Control over their military
forces. Even though the NAC enlarged the influence of NNCN in the
operations they choose to participate in and are consulted and offered
the opportunity to put forward views on all relevant issues of the
operations, NATO, still retains full political decision-making
authority.30 This shows that NATO as an international organization can
act, to a certain extent, independently from States participating in the
operation, in particular with respect to NNCN. 4.3.2 Planning Process of
NATO Operations [A [second area]{.mark} where the particular nature of
the relationship between NATO and the member States becomes apparent
[is]{.mark} during [the operational planning
process]{.mark}]{.underline}. It would be fair to conclude that NATO
[was effectively an instrument of the member States until the early
1990s.]{.underline} During the Cold War-period, the planning of
operations was limited to the development of several regional Standing
Defence Plans against one identified potential aggressor. These plans
were preapproved by the NAC. The Defence Planning Committee31 set
so-called "Force Goals" to which member States commit their forces for a
period of 6 years. Member States annually reported on how they intended
to meet these requirements.32 Overall, the decisions were taken at the
capitals without much need of NATO's involvement other than being a
forum where discussions could take place. NATO relied on the same
planning processes that existed during the Cold War for its first
"non-article 5" operations in the early 1990s. And in fact, there was no
real need to change the planning processes, as the first operations were
fairly straightforward. They consisted of monitoring of an arms embargo
(e.g. operation Maritime Monitor) or a no-fly zone (e.g. operation Sky
Monitor). Neither, the IFOR, SFOR and KFOR required much involvement of
NATO in the planning of the operation, as most of the forces were
provided by a leader framework nation, which would take the
responsibility for organizing the forces necessary in a specific sector.
For instance, in implementing the Dayton Peace Agreement,
Bosnia-Herzegovina was divided into 3 regions for which each a lead
nation was assigned to carry out the operation.33 The planning of ISAF
and NATO Training Mission in Iraq (NTM-I) operations was much more
complex. These operations took place much farther away from NATO's
borders adding complexity in logistical planning and defence
expenditure. They also took place in much less benign environments.
Moreover, both operations went beyond the monitoring of a cease-fire and
included tasks such as counter-insurgency activities, reconstruction of
civil infrastructure and mentoring of government officials. The
increased complexity of the operations required a more sophisticated
planning process than the pre-delegation model that was used in previous
operations. In the current planning process, when tasked by the NAC,
SACEUR will conduct a formal assessment of the identified crisis and
will give considerations on the use of the NATO military instrument to
assist with a situation resolution. The NAC may then task SACEUR to
develop military response options. Subsequently, the NAC may decide
whether SACEUR should provide a concept of operations within the
political direction given by the Council.34 The member States rely
heavily on the planning done by SACEUR's staff, as its integrated system
analysis, planning and assessment tools,35 congregated databases on
capabilities and availability of member States' forces36 and doctrine37
provide planning capabilities that are not easily replicated in the
national Ministries of Defense. The planning process does not alter the
national autonomy of the member States or their 'veto' power at the NAC.
[The member States retain their authority to disapprove certain
proposals]{.underline} and to halt or change a given course of action.
[However, the incremental decision-making process]{.underline} and the
unique planning capabilities of NATO [make it more [difficult for member
States to refuse participation]{.mark} on general grounds and
[discourages uncooperative behaviour]{.mark}]{.underline}.38 This
observation leads to the conclusion that [even though the
[member]{.mark} States retain sovereign control over NATO's actions, the
degree of [control is limited]{.mark}]{.underline} on general political
aspects of a mission and not on the specifics of each aspect of the
operation. 4.3.3 The Command and Control Relationship [The
[third]{.mark} and the last [area]{.mark} that is examined here with
respect to the relationship between NATO and its member States [is the
**c**]{.mark}ommand and **[c]{.mark}**ontrol relationship.]{.underline}
NATO does not have military forces permanently assigned to the
Organization. When a mission is deemed necessary, NATO will request
nations to contribute the required forces and materiel to the mission.
Nations will inform NATO on their contributions and transfer part of
their authority over their forces to Alliance.39 Authority is then
delegated throughout the organization at various levels. The degree of
authority that each of the levels exercises is defined by the 'command
and control' structure set in place.40 'Command' is the authority to
direct, coordinate or control armed forces to achieve particular
objectives. 'Control' is the authority to organise, direct and
coordinate the activities of the forces assigned to implement orders and
directives. NATO differentiates between three levels of command and
control, ranging from (a) Full Command, (b) Operational Command and
Control and (c) Tactical Command and Control. States normally retain
"Full Command", which is the authority that covers every aspect of
military and administration. It is very uncommon for States to transfer
Full Command to NATO or any other international organization or State.
Full Command includes the authority to decide to participate in a
certain mission and to withdraw from participation in accordance with
the terms agreed to. It also includes the authority to take
administrative and disciplinary measures against personnel of its own
armed forces.41 As described in Chapter 2, the Commander of the Kosovo
Force ( COMKFOR) did not have the authority to take disciplinary
measures against personnel that violated his order not to frequent
prostitutes in Kosovo or to be engaged in the act of human trafficking.
COMKFOR was dependent on the sending States to ensure that such
regulations are enforceable through national disciplinary sanctions.42
[[States]{.mark} that contribute forces to NATO operations normally
[will transfer "Operational **C**]{.mark}ommand and
**[C]{.mark}**ontrol" [to the Alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}. Operational
Command is [the authority to assign missions or tasks, to deploy units
and to reassign forces]{.underline}.43 It is the authority needed to
effectuate the overall strategic objectives of the whole operation.
Operational Control is the authority to direct forces assigned so that
the commander may accomplish specific missions or tasks which are
usually limited by function, time, or location. This includes the
authority to issue binding directives for forces assigned to his
command. For example, as illustrated in Chapter 2, the tactical
directive issued by COMISAF that restrained the use of force by troops
assigned to him is an example of operational control. COMKFOR similarly
had the authority to limit the frequenting certain bars and locales by
KFOR personnel is the exercise of operational control. 'Tactical
Command' is also transferred by TCNs to SACEUR. SACEUR usually delegates
tactical command to subordinate command. Tactical Command is the
authority to assign tasks to forces for the accomplishment of the
mission, and Tactical Control is the detailed and local direction and
control of movements or manoeuvres necessary to accomplish missions or
tasks assigned. TCNs will ordinarily transfer Operational Command and
Control to NATO, while retaining Full Command -- including
Administrative Control -- over their forces. The transfer follows a
formal procedure, which entails the TCN sending SACEUR a 'transfer of
authority message'. This message describes which units are placed under
command of NATO and which level of authority is being transferred.
[[After]{.mark} the [transfer of command to NATO]{.mark}, the [nations
are not able to exercise control]{.mark} over their forces
anymore]{.underline}, except by re-assuming command and thereby
effectively taking their forces out from the mission. States may,
however, issue limitations and restriction on the use of their forces,
i.e. 'national caveats' and 'red-card holdership'.44 In few instances,
TCNs have re-assumed command over their forces during a NATO operation.
As described in Chapter 2 of this book, Canada reassumed command over
its forces during ISAF, when it assessed that the transfer of detainees
captured by Canadian forces to the government of Afghanistan would pose
them to the risk of being tortured. The transfer of authority over
forces from States to NATO has relevant consequences to the question of
responsibility for wrongful conduct during NATO operations, in
particular to the aspect of attribution. Attribution of a wrongful act
to NATO depends on whether NATO has international legal personality and
whether the wrongful act was under the effective control of NATO. These
issues are examined more elaborately in Chapters 5 and 7 of this book.
It is relevant to note here that when TCNs place their forces at the
disposal of NATO, they transfer the authority to assign missions or
tasks, to deploy units and to reassign forces. This means that NATO
exercises effective control over these forces with respect to
mission-related tasks. This effective control, however, may be
undermined by the issuance of national caveats, limitations or
interference by the TCN involved or when the TCN decides to re-assume
command over its forces. NATO['s command and control relationship also
illustrate the relationship that the Alliance has with its member
States]{.underline} and other TCNs. [Nations transfer the authority over
their forces to NATO, which [indicates that]{.mark} the [Alliance
has]{.mark} a large degree of [autonomy]{.mark}]{.underline}, even if
nations still retain the possibility to re-assume command over their
forces and the fact that they can impose limitations and restrictions on
the use of the forces. 4.4 The Relationship between NATO and the UN
NATO's constituent document refers in several places to the UN, the UN
Security Council and the UN Charter, showing the commitment of the
founding members to the principles of the United Nations. Certain
founding States even suggested to define NATO as a 'regional
arrangement' in reference to Chapter  viii of the UN Charter.45 Under
Chapter viii of the UN Charter, the UN Security Council may utilise such
arrangements or agencies for enforcement action under its authority.
This suggestion was, however, opposed46 as it could be interpreted as
making NATO's enforcement measures subject to a veto in the UN Security
Council, rendering NATO's existence absurd.47 Any reference to Chapter
viii of the UN Charter was therefore intentionally omitted, leaving only
Article 51 of the UN Charter as a basis for military action(s) of NATO
under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. NATO was not considered to
become an organization that would be used to implement measures taken by
the UN Security Council in accordance with Chapter vii of the UN
Charter. The perception that NATO could not be a vehicle for the UN
Security Council to implement its mandates, changed after the fall of
the Soviet Union, when an institutionalised relationship between NATO
and the UN started to emerge. The United Nations was involved in
peacekeeping operations since 195648 and saw an enormous increase in
missions from 1989.49 These operations were entirely conducted under UN
command and control, without participation of any other international
organization. Member States would be requested to provide troops and
materiel to a un-led mission. The personnel were placed at the disposal
of the UN, which were characteristically identified as "blue-helmets".
With the increased demand for missions, the UN turned to lead nations
and international organizations to take over some of the burden to plan
and lead peacekeeping and peace-enforcements missions. NATO became an
important partner for the UN as the UN lacked the resources to implement
its peace enforcement measures. NATO, on its turn, found the
participation in the UN missions important as it was trying to redefine
its tasks and activities and to transform its structure to meet the
security challenges which occurred in the post-Cold War period. An
important aspect defining the un-NATO relationship in the context of
peace operations is the detailed guidance given by the UN Security
Council regarding the mandate and the objectives to be achieved of a
specific peace operation. The UN Security Council can authorise member
States or international organizations50 to implement a specific mandate.
In earlier UN Security Council resolutions, this mandate contained
detailed guidance on how the objectives of the operation were to be
achieved. For instance, UNSCR 1244(1999) listed eight specific areas for
which the NATO-led Kosovo Force was made responsible.51 More recent UN
Security Council resolutions leave a fair amount of discretionary power
to the mandated entity to decide on how it will attain the objectives,
basically authorizing to "take all necessary measures" to fulfil the
mandate.52 The Security Council does not impose a specific command
relationship or hierarchy between the UN and the mandated entity.
However, in certain situations it requires States or international
organization to coordinate with the UN Secretary General on the measures
taken to implement the mandate or to report on the progress of the
operation periodically.53 NATO and the UN cooperated quite successfully
during operations in the Balkans. Initially, NATO enforced UN Security
Council's embargo on weapons in the Adriatic Sea54 and a no-fly zone
over Bosnia-Herzegovina.55 The cooperation intensified when the Alliance
provided air support to the United Nations Protection Force, or
unprofor.56 Close air support provided by NATO was made conditional on
the approval by the UN, which strained the relationship between the two
organizations. Politically divergent views between the UN and NATO on
the air support to UNPROFOR resulted in a time lag in the taking of
decisions or resulted in no decisions at all. The observed difficulties
led to future operations being more independent from each other. For
instance, KFOR was placed outside UNMiK's command and had a separate
mandate.57 Subsequent operations also showed that NATO operations and UN
operations in the same area have distinct mandates, tasks and command
structure. In Iraq, the NATO Training Mission-Iraq (NTM-I) is separated
from the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) and in Afghanistan, the
United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan -- a peacekeeping
mission focusing on recovery and reconstruction58 -- was separate from
ISAF's more stand-alone character with its own mandate and its own
command structure.59 In 2005, the Alliance proposed a framework
agreement with the UN to create a more structured relationship between
the two organizations.60 In September 2008, this proposal resulted in a
Joint Declaration between the UN and NATO on their mutual cooperation,
in particular in the field of information sharing and operational
coordination and support.61 Paragraph 4 of the Declaration stipulates
that: Understanding that this framework should be flexible and evolving
over time, we agree to further develop the cooperation between our
organizations on issues of common interest, in, but not limited to,
communication and information-sharing, including on issues pertaining to
the protection of civilian populations; capacity-building, training and
exercises; lessons learned, planning and support for contingencies; and
operational coordination and support. In conclusion, The UN Security
Council is the only institution to authorise the use of force to
maintain or restore international peace and security. A UN Security
Council resolution is the legal basis for NATO to conduct non-article 5
crisis response operations, that involve the use of force. UN Security
Council resolutions will continue to govern NATO's non-article 5
operations, but the Alliance remains independent from the United Nations
in aspects of command and control in NATO operations. The Security
Council will not have any authority regarding the command and control of
forces in NATO-led operations. The UN can not assign missions or tasks
to NATO personnel, to deploy units or to reassign the forces. This
authority will be vested in the commander that has Operational Command,
which is SACEUR. This aspect is relevant to the question of
responsibility of NATO for violations of international law and will be
further examined in Chapter 7. 4.5 [Conclusions]{.underline} This
chapter has described the institutional framework of NATO. [Member
States are represented in the North Atlantic Council (NAC),]{.underline}
which is the highest political organ of the Alliance. Decisions on NATO
operations are taken by the Council through consensus. The Secretary
General of the Alliance is responsible for steering this process of
consultation and has several tools at its disposal to achieve consensus,
in particular the so-called '[silence procedure'. Consensus and [the
silence procedure show]{.mark} that [NATO enjoys]{.mark} a degree of
[autonomy]{.mark} from its member States]{.underline}, as the Alliance
can function even without full agreement of all of the members. The NAC,
its supporting International Staff and the civilian agencies constitute
the civilian structure of the Alliance. The military structure consists
of the Military Committee, supported by the International Military
Staff, the two Supreme Commands and international military headquarters
subordinate to them. Supreme Allied Commander Europe commands NATO
operations. SACEUR has "operational command and control" over the
military forces assigned to him by the Troop Contributing Nations, which
could either be member States or States that are not member to NATO
(Non-NATO Contributing Nations, or NNCN). Two aspects are relevant to
note here. First, States that participate in NATO-led operations
transfer a significant degree of control over military forces to NATO.
Chapter 7 will examine in more detail whether the degree of control
transferred to NATO by States equates to 'effective control'. If NATO
does have effective control over conduct of forces placed at its
disposal, the conduct can be attributed to NATO. Secondly, it is
relevant to note that the [[participation of NNCN]{.mark} in NATO-led
operations [show that **NATO is a separate entity from its member
States**]{.mark}]{.underline}. NNCN do not take part in the
decision-making process at the political level and neither have
operational command and control over their forces once they are placed
under the authority of SACEUR. This illustrates that NATO [can act
separately from its member States and enjoys a high degree of
autonomy]{.underline}. This feature -- further examined in Chapter  5 
-- [speaks [in favour of]{.mark} the existence of
**[i]{.mark}**nternational **[l]{.mark}**egal **[p]{.mark}**ersonality
of NATO.]{.underline}

The question is therefore left entirely open. 14 [The fact remains that,
[in the **absence of certainty**]{.mark} and given the **extreme
rarity** of the practice, [one can]{.mark} at least [use the **draft of
the C.D.I.**]{.mark} by analogy and, in particular, on the one hand
articles 4 to 9 and 11 of the preliminary draft of 2000]{.underline}
(which correspond to articles 5 to 10 of the draft of 1996), which
relate to the attribution strictly speaking, and , above all, Articles
16 to 19 (27 to 28 old) These latter envisage three hypotheses in which
the \"responsibility of a State with regard to the act of another
State\" may be engaged. One clearly seems to have to be discarded: that
of coercion (envisaged by the new article 18); [it seems [**absurd** to
consider that the **Member States of NATO** were able to
**exert**]{.mark} **on it a [constraint]{.mark}**]{.underline} leading
it to commit one or more internationally wrongful acts, and vice versa.
Two possibilities therefore remain. That of complicity (aid or
assistance in the commission of an internationally wrongful act - new
article 16) and that of \"direction and \[du\] control exercised in the
commission of an internationally wrongful act\" (article 17 new). In
both cases, it seems to me that you have to ask yourself \"who controls
whom?\" (article 17) and \"who is an accomplice of whom?\" (section 16).
In other words, does NATO control the member states? or are the states
controlling NATO? Firstly; and is NATO the accomplice of the Member
States? or the contrary? on the other hand. Asked in this way, the
questions are a little reminiscent of the children\'s game that is
called in France \"I hold you, you hold me by the goatee\" \... And, to
tell the truth, it is possible to support, reasonably, one as the other
of the two theses. Member states control NATO - they make the decisions
within its bodies and it depends on them for its financial resources,
ammunition and men. But [**[NATO controls its Members]{.mark}** in the
sense that [**they act** on and **in accordance with its
decisions**]{.mark}.]{.underline} That said, an essential element,
clearly highlighted in Professor Stein\'s communication16 and which
constitutes [the starting point of the 1995 **resolution of the
Institute of International Law** on \"The [**legal consequences** for
Member States of **non-performance** by international
organizations]{.mark} of their obligations towards third
parties]{.underline}\",17 must be taken into account: [[**NATO is an
international organization** and]{.mark}, as such, it [enjoys
**i**]{.mark}nternational **[l]{.mark}**egal
**[p]{.mark}**ersonality.]{.underline}18 It is true that it is rather
special organization, the institutionalization of which has been
empirical and progressive. legal capacity and privileges and immunities,
all of which led [[the **I**]{.mark}nternational **[C]{.mark}**ourt of
**[J]{.mark}**ustice, with regard to the **United Nations**, [to
conclude,]{.mark} in its opinion of 11 April 1949 relating to
Reparations for damage suffered in the service of the United Nations,
that [she was an \"**international person**]{.mark}\".]{.underline}
\"This means that the Organization is a subject of international law,
that it has the capacity to be the holder of international rights and
duties and that it has the capacity to avail itself of its rights by way
of international claim\".20 Moreover, this responsibility is
objective,21 [which means that it forms a screen between the
Organization and not only its **[Member States]{.mark}**, not only the
**third States which have [recognized]{.mark}** it, but also **vis-à-vis
other States**]{.underline}, in much the same way that a State exists
independently of the recognitions of which it is the object. Counterpart
of the right belonging to the Organization to seek the responsibility of
other subjects of international law, it can also be the addressee of a
claim, in particular when an internationally wrongful act can, as in
this case, be attributed to it. It alone bears the responsibility for
its own acts and it seems impossible - except to deny, in reality, [[its
**i**]{.mark}nternational **[l]{.mark}**egal
**[p]{.mark}**ersonality]{.underline} - that the responsibility of its
Members be sought for its operations or \"through it\".

[[NATO has nine "partners across the globe" or "global partners", which
the Alliance cooperates with]{.mark} on an individual basis. NATO's
global partners include **Afghanistan**, **Australia**, **Colombia**,
**Iraq**, **Japan**, **the Republic of Korea**, **Mongolia**, **New
Zealand** and **Pakistan**. NATO['s engagement with global partners is
taking on **increasing importance**]{.mark} in a complex security
environment, [where]{.mark} many of the challenges [the Alliance]{.mark}
faces are **[global]{.mark}** and **no longer bound by
geography.**]{.underline}

[[The NATO **2030 agenda**]{.mark} agreed by NATO Leaders at the NATO
Brussels 2021 Summit [seeks to **strengthen NATO's** ]{.mark}**global
[cooperation with]{.mark} like-minded partners, especially with its
[global partners]{.mark}**, to defend the rules-based international
order and institutions, to set international norms and standards in
space and **[in cyberspace, and on new technologies]{.mark}** and global
arms control.]{.underline}

[[Since 2016, NATO has increasingly engaged]{.mark} politically
[with]{.mark} its four Asia-Pacific [partners]{.mark}]{.underline} --
Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea and New Zealand -- notably
through meetings of the North Atlantic Council, including a first
meeting at the level of foreign ministers in December 2020, to discuss
the shift in the global balance of power and the rise of China.

NATO is also intensifying dialogue and cooperation with Colombia.

[**[Global partners have access to the full range of activities NATO
offers]{.mark}** to all partners guided by an Individual Partnership
Cooperation Programme. [They work with NATO on a range of]{.mark} common
**cross-cutting security [challenges]{.mark}** [such as **cyber
defence**]{.mark}, **counter-terrorism**, **non-proliferation** and
**resilience**.]{.underline}

[Some **[partners participate in]{.mark} NATO's [military
operations]{.mark}**,]{.underline} while many have benefited from NATO's
expertise in areas such as building defence capacity, and defence
training and education.

NATO also consults with other non-member countries, which have no
bilateral programme of cooperation (for example, China, Brazil, Ghana,
India, Singapore) in particular on regional security dynamics.

[[At]{.mark} the NATO [Brussels]{.mark} Summit in June 2021, [Allies
agreed to **strengthen**]{.mark} **NATO [engagement ]{.mark}**[with key
global actors]{.mark}]{.underline} and other new interlocutors beyond
the Euro-Atlantic area, including those from Africa, Asia and Latin
America.

Wider cooperation

[In today's **complex security environment**, NATO['s relations with
partners]{.mark} across the globe [offers **many advantages**]{.mark} to
Allies and partners alike.]{.underline} NATO's practical cooperation
with its global partners includes cross-cutting global challenges such
as cyber defence, maritime security, humanitarian assistance and
disaster relief, non-proliferation, defence science and technology, and
Women, Peace and Security. Some partners participate in NATO's military
operations, while many have also benefited from NATO's expertise in
areas such as building defence capacity, and defence training and
education.

Political consultation and intelligence-sharing is fundamental to the
way NATO works with its global partners, just as it is among the 30
Allies. Political dialogue is a key tool for fostering regional
understanding and exchanging expertise between Allies and their global
partners. This enriches NATO's situational awareness in areas beyond its
direct neighbourhood, and it ensures that global partners understand
NATO's positions and are able to contribute to policy discussions on
common security challenges. This is increasing in importance as many of
today's new security challenges are no longer bound by geography, such
as in cyber space, space and climate change. Political dialogue also
assists in establishing and developing practical cooperation with these
partners.

Political dialogue with NATO's global partners take place in many
different formats, including at NATO Headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.
Just as Allied consultations take place in a broad range of committees
and at different levels, so too do several global partners participate
in these committees on a regular basis, from the level of ministers to
technical working groups. For example, NATO's four Asia-Pacific partners
-- Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea and New Zealand --
participate on a regular basis in discussions in the Political Committee
and in the North Atlantic Council.

At the most senior level, the Secretary General, the Deputy Secretary
General, the Chair of the Military Committee and NATO's Strategic
Commanders meet with global partners' Heads of State and Government,
foreign ministers, defence ministers, as well as other high-level
officials.

Support for NATO-led operations

[The **[support provided by global partners]{.mark}** and other
countries **to NATO-led operations** [has made a significant
contribution]{.mark} to **international peace and
security.**]{.underline}

In Afghanistan, a number of global partners such as Australia, the
Republic of Korea and New Zealand, made important contributions to the
NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) from 2003 to
2014. Many continued to work alongside Allies in the follow-on Resolute
Support Mission to train, advise and assist the Afghan security forces
and institutions. Some countries supported stabilisation efforts in
Afghanistan without being involved in combat. This includes Japan, which
funded a large number of development projects and dispatched liaison
officers, and Pakistan that provided ground and air lines of
communication to resupply the mission . In 2020, the Republic of Korea
served as the co-chair of the Afghan National Army Trust Fund Board.

Evolution of relations

[[NATO has **maintained a dialogue**]{.mark} with **countries that are
not part of its partnership frameworks**, on an ad-hoc basis, [since
the]{.mark} 19**[90s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, NATO's involvement
in areas outside of its immediate region -- including Afghanistan and
Libya -- has increased the need and opportunities for enhanced global
interaction. Clearly, the emergence of global threats requires the
cooperation of a wider range of countries to successfully tackle
challenges such as terrorism, proliferation, piracy or cyber attacks.
Dialogue with these countries can also help NATO avert crises and, when
needed, manage an operation throughout all phases.

Since 1998, NATO [[has invited **countries**]{.mark} **across the
globe** [to participate in its]{.mark} **activities, workshops,
exercises and [conferences]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This decision marked
a policy shift for the Alliance, allowing these countries to have
access, through the case-by-case approval of the North Atlantic Council,
to activities offered under NATO's structured partnerships. These
countries were known as "Contact Countries".

Significant steps were taken at the 2006 Riga Summit to increase the
operational relevance of NATO's cooperation with countries that are part
of its structured partnership frameworks as well as other countries
around the world. These steps, reinforced by decisions at the 2008
Bucharest Summit, defined a set of objectives for these relationships
and created avenues for enhanced political dialogue, including meetings
of the North Atlantic Council with ministers of the countries concerned,
high-level talks, and meetings with ambassadors. In addition, annual
work programmes (then referred to as Individual Tailored Cooperation
Packages of Activities) were further developed.

At the 2010 Lisbon Summit, Allies agreed to develop a more efficient and
flexible partnership policy, in time for the meeting of Allied foreign
ministers in Berlin in April 2011. To this end, they decided to:

streamline NATO's partnership tools in order to open all cooperative
activities and exercises to partners and to harmonise partnership
programmes;

better engage with partners across the globe who contribute
significantly to security and reach out to relevant partners to build
trust, increase transparency and develop practical cooperation;

develop flexible formats to discuss security challenges with partners
and enhance existing fora for political dialogue; and

build on improvements in NATO's training mechanisms and consider methods
to enhance individual partners' ability to build capacity.

Following the 2010 Lisbon Summit and NATO's subsequent revision of its
partnership policy in April 2011, the global context has changed
significantly. As NATO became increasingly confronted with new defence
and security challenges such as cyber attacks, disinformation,
disruptive technologies and the erosion of arms control regimes, NATO
recognised the importance of adapting to these new security challenges,
including working closer together with NATO's partners.

This increasing engagement with NATO's like-minded partners, regardless
of geographic location, on the basis of the shared values of democratic
freedoms, rule of law and human rights, allows Allies to discuss
relevant developments in the regions with partners, and increase their
situational awareness and understanding of strategic issues on relevant
global developments.

[In June 2020, NATO Secretary General Jens [Stoltenberg]{.mark} launched
his [outline for NATO **2030**]{.mark}. In order for NATO to keep its
Allies safe in a more uncertain world, the Secretary General stated that
NATO [must]{.mark} "stay strong militarily, be more united politically,
and [take a **broader approach globally**]{.mark}." NATO taking a more
global approach means **[work]{.mark}**ing even more **[closely with
like-minded partners]{.mark}**]{.underline} to develop coherent, strong,
unified and collective responses to defend our values in a world of
increased global competition.

The global pillar of NATO 2030 is particularly relevant to NATO's
engagement with its four Asia-Pacific partners -- Australia, Japan, the
Republic of Korea and New Zealand. As the challenges confronting the
Euro-Atlantic area and the Asia-Pacific region are increasingly
converging, it is vital for NATO and its four close partners in the
Asia-Pacific region to enhance cooperation and dialogue to support
security in both regions, but also to work together to strengthen the
international rules-based order. In December 2020, for the first time,
the four Asia-Pacific partners participated in a NATO Foreign
Ministerial Meeting, where NATO Allies discussed the shift in the global
balance of power and the rise of China with the Asia-Pacific partners,
as well as with Finland, Sweden and the European Union High
Representative/ Vice President of the European Commission.

[At the **2021 Brussels Summit**, [Allies]{.mark} agreed to
[increase]{.mark} dialogue and **practical cooperation between NATO and
existing partners**, including partners in the Asia-Pacific, and to
**strengthen NATO [engagement]{.mark}** [with **key global
actors**]{.mark} and other new interlocutors beyond the Euro-Atlantic
area, including from Africa, Asia and Latin America.]{.underline}

Artificial intelligence (AI) may sound futuristic, but it already exists
in many everyday technologies. For example, it gives our handheld
devices voice and facial recognition capabilities. [AI is]{.underline}
also [making its presence felt in biotechnology]{.underline}, where [it
has become integral to many aspects of]{.underline} drug discovery and
[development]{.underline}. AI applications in biotech include drug
target identification, drug screening, image screening, and predictive
modeling. [AI is]{.underline} also [being used to comb through the
scientific literature and manage clinical trial data.]{.underline} By
leveraging machine learning, AI can manage disparate clinical trial
datasets, enable virtual screening, and analyze vast amounts of data.
Besides reducing clinical trial costs, [AI can gain otherwise
unobtainable insights]{.underline} and feed them back into the drug
development process. AI technologies [to serve the biotech
industry]{.underline} are being developed by several companies. [Their
services are rapidly becoming indispensable]{.underline} as older
methods like classical statistical analysis or manual image scanning
reach their practical limits.

[The cyberattack surface in modern enterprise artificial
intelligence]{.underline} graphics Source environments is massive, and
it's continuing to grow rapidly. This means that analyzing and improving
an organization's cybersecurity posture needs more than mere human
intervention. **[AI and machine learning are now becoming essential to
information security,]{.underline}** [as these technologies are capable
of swiftly analyzing millions of data sets and tracking down a wide
variety of cyber threats]{.underline} --- from malware menaces to shady
behavior that might result in a phishing attack. These technologies
continually learn and improve, drawing data from past experiences and
present to pinpoint new varieties of attacks that can occur today or
tomorrow. In this post, we'll review the use of AI in cybersecurity
(both good and bad), along with what the experts and executives have to
say about this matter.

[Biotech companies should incorporate a solid cybersecurity
posture]{.underline} as they progress from entrepreneurial start-up
towards public listing. In brief The 'bad guys' are always looking for
their next target. Companies preparing to list create a lot of buzz, and
draw the attention of these bad guys. [[Cybersecurity has become
a]{.underline}]{.mark} business [[imperative]{.underline}]{.mark}. As
every biotech company is unique, a cybersecurity program needs to be
customized to their specific risks[. By understanding their
cybersecurity posture, [biotech companies can make better
decisions]{.mark} towards a more secure future.]{.underline} Publicly
listed biotechs: attractive targets for cyber criminals One thing cyber
criminals, hacktivists, nation states and other malicious actors have in
common is that they generally do their homework, looking for the next
opportunity and target. Biotech entrepreneurs that are leading their
companies towards successful initial public offerings (IPOs), draw
attention to themselves through media announcements and investment
community buzz. Consequently, as also shown in the visual below, these
companies are commonly targeted for their intellectual property,
financial information and other sensitive assets, their "crown jewels."
[Today, [cybersecurity is no longer just a]{.mark} technology or [risk
issue. It has become a]{.mark} strategic business
[imperative]{.mark}]{.underline}. A cyber breach or data leak would be
detrimental right before an IPO -- a critical time when the integrity of
your company and your brand needs to be perceived as positively as
possible. \[AD OMITTED\] Defining the right cybersecurity approach The
right cybersecurity program helps defend a company by defining and
developing controls that enable stable growth, safeguard critical
assets, reduce the likelihood of a breach, or to help recover quickly
should there be an incident[. It's best to develop a cybersecurity
strategy and program]{.underline} that suits a specific company's needs
and environment, with best practices and recommendations that are
essential for pre-IPO companies. [[By taking a proactive
approach]{.mark} to managing cybersecurity risk, [you'll send a positive
message]{.mark}]{.underline} to existing and future investors, board
members and other key stakeholders: [not [only do you care about
innovation]{.mark} and generating value [but you care enough to protect
it.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[[\<\<\<GRAY HIGHLIGHTING FOR REFERENCE\>\>\>\>]{.underline}]{.mark}**

With the popularization of information and the establishment of the
databases in great number, and how to extract data from the useful
information is the urgent problem to be solved. **[[Machine learning is
the core issue of artificial intelligence
research]{.underline}]{.mark}**, this paper introduces the definition of
machine learning and its basic structure, and describes a variety of
machine learning methods, including rote learning, inductive learning,
analogy learning , explained learning, learning based on neural network
and knowledge discovery and so on. This paper also brings foreword the
objectives of machine learning, and points out the development trend of
machine learning. Learning is the main hallmark of human intelligence
and the basic means to obtain knowledge. Machine learning is the
fundamental way to make the computer intelligent. R.Shank has said: \"If
a computer can not learn, it will not be called intelligent.\" Since
learning is an integrative mental activity with memory, thinking,
perception, feeling, and other mental activities closely related. So,
researchers from different fields give a different interpretation with
different disciplines respectively, and give some different points of
view. II. MACHINE LEARNING Machine learning is a subject that studies
how to use computers to simulate human learning activities, and to study
self-improvement methods of computers that to obtain new knowledge and
new skills, identify existing knowledge, and continuously improve the
performance and achievement. Compared with human learning, machine
learning learns faster, the accumulation of knowledge is more facilitate
the results of learning spread easier. So, any progress of human in the
field of machine learning, will enhance the capability of computers,
thus have an impact on human society

[[Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence]{.mark},
which is broadly [defined as the capability of a machine to imitate
intelligent human behavior]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Artificial
intelligence systems are used to perform complex tasks in a way that is
similar to how humans solve problems. The goal of AI is to create
computer models that exhibit "intelligent behaviors" like humans,
according to Boris Katz, a principal research scientist and head of the
InfoLab Group at CSAIL. This means machines that can recognize a visual
scene, understand a text written in natural language, or perform an
action in the physical world. Machine learning is one way to use AI. It
was defined in the 1950s by AI pioneer Arthur Samuel as "[the field of
study that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being
programmed."]{.underline}

Under this definition, "security sector assistance" includes the
relevant policies, programs, or activities of any executive agency.
Complicating matters, though, Congress has considered a proposed
definition for "security sector assistance" that, in contrast to the
presidential policy definition,130 encompasses DoS programs, but not DoD
or other executive agency programs.131 In addition,
[[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[**defined** "security

it has **not** defined "security assistance]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[[The DoD]{.underline}]{.mark} adheres to the presidential policy
definition and [[**further defines** "security coop]{.mark}eration[" as

which the DoD defines as a subset of security cooperation that is funded
and authorized by the DoS]{.underline} and administered by the Defense

https://warontherocks.com/2019/09/terrorist-groups-artificial-intelligence-and-killer-drones/\]

In 2016, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) carried out its
first successful drone attack in combat, killing two Peshmerga warriors
in northern Iraq. The attack continued the group's record of employing
increasingly sophisticated technologies against its enemies, a trend
mimicked by other nonstate armed groups around the world. The following
year, the group announced the formation of the "Unmanned Aircraft of the
Mujahedeen," a division dedicated to the development and use of drones,
and a more formal step toward the long-term weaponization of drone
technology.

Terrorist groups are increasingly using 21st-century technologies,
including drones and elementary artificial intelligence (AI), in
attacks. As it continues to be weaponized, AI could prove a formidable
threat, allowing adversaries --- including nonstate actors --- to
automate killing on a massive scale. The combination of drone expertise
and more sophisticated AI could allow terrorist groups to acquire or
develop lethal autonomous weapons, or "killer robots," which would
dramatically increase their capacity to create incidents of mass
destruction in Western cities. As it expands its artificial intelligence
capabilities, the U.S. government should also strengthen its anti-AI
capacity, paying particular attention to nonstate actors and the
enduring threats they pose. For the purposes of this article, [I [define

'[**Autonomous'**, '**unmanned'**, '**uncrewed'**, '**lean manning'**...
[over the]{.mark} past few [years]{.mark}, the defence world has seen [a
**proliferation of terms** emerge]{.mark}]{.underline} to refer to the
progressive removal of humans from naval vessels. And, as is usually the
case with most buzzwords entering a new domain, most of these [**terms
have been used [interchangeably]{.mark}** [to underpin the
**evolution**]{.mark} **of** Unmanned Surface Vehicles (**USV**) and
Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (**[UUV]{.mark}**).]{.underline}

[The [reality]{.mark}, of course, [is]{.mark} far more [**complex**.
Behind]{.mark}]{.underline} the concepts of USVs and UUVs [[lie
**different levels of autonomy**,]{.mark} with different [degrees of
**human involvement**]{.mark}]{.underline} for different missions and
with each degree of autonomy/human involvement comes a range of
operational opportunities and technological challenges.

Unpacking Autonomy

"When we talk about 'autonomy' we need to have a common language,"
Matthew Hunt, product line director Mine Warfare Systems at Thales,
told AI. "This is important because [[if it is **fully
autonomous**]{.mark}, capable of **sensing and reacting** to its
environment[, it is]{.mark} a **[totally different]{.mark} tool** [to an
**automated clockwork system** following **pre-defined
patterns**]{.mark} underwater."]{.underline} Depending on the level of
autonomy, the systems will be more or less complicated, will integrate
different technologies and may be used in different operational
contexts.

In a White Paper titled Navigating the Ethical Use of Autonomous Weapons
Systems, published in June 2020, the BMT Group presents an overview of
the different levels of control. It draws from the Maritime Autonomous
Surface Ships (MASS) UK Industry Conduct Principles and Code of
Practice, as well as from a number of other reports, to define six
levels: manned, operated, directed, delegated, monitored and autonomous.

["[Moving to **fully autonomous**]{.mark}, however, continues to
[present **fundamental**]{.mark} **ethical
[challenges]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} said Jake Rigby, research and
development lead for Defence and Security at BMT.

For Hunt, it means that these systems must fulfil the three Ts: Trust
that the system will work every time the way it is expected to; and,
Technology and Time, that is, the ability for navies to quickly adapt to
fast-paced technological advances by working closely with industry.

As such, presently, the increasing number of [**USV and [UUV
programmes]{.mark}** [undertaken by **tier one navies**]{.mark} across
the world [span]{.mark} across [the **first levels of
autonomy**]{.mark}. They feature [systems that range from being remotely
operated]{.mark} by navy crew [to platforms that can be
programmed]{.mark} to carry out pre-defined monitored missions
autonomously. [The latter **does not,**]{.mark} however,
**[equal]{.mark} full levels of [autonomy]{.mark}**[: the **human is**
still **in the loop** and]{.mark} the **[parameters]{.mark} of each
mission [are]{.mark} very [clearly defined]{.mark}** in advance.
[**Autonomy** extends to **navigation**, **data gathering** and **data

Designed to operate below the water's surface in both littoral (coastal)
areas and the open sea, **[[Autonomous UUVs]{.underline}]{.mark}** have
no crew aboard and are capable of [**[carry]{.mark}**ing [out
**missions** using]{.mark} a mix of reconfigurable **[pre-programmed

when near the surface, GPS navigation. They are similar to
Remotely-Operated Underwater Vehicles (ROVs), but ROVs are piloted by a
human on another nearby water craft via a tether, while Autonomous UUVs
operate independent of a human pilot, so there is no tether. These
unmanned submersibles simply perform their assigned mission, then return
to pre-programmed coordinates with no human intervention.

[[**UUV operation** is not a **binary choice**]{.mark} between **fully
manual** or **fully autonomous**]{.underline}, rather [[there are
different]{.mark} **levels of autonomy** ([LoA]{.mark})]{.underline}
\[[35](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7663020/#B35-sensors-20-06203)\].
For this work, we will adopt and adapt the six levels of autonomy
proposed for surgical robots in
\[[36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7663020/#B36-sensors-20-06203)\].

[0. **[No Autonomy]{.mark}**]{.underline}---the UUV is entirely
tele-operated by a human.

[1. **[Robot Assistance]{.mark}**]{.underline}---the UUV provides some
automated functionality, for example staying at a set depth (set by the
operator) or prohibiting the operator to maneuver into obstacles. The
operator is still in full control of the UUV.

[2. **[Task Autonomy]{.mark}**]{.underline}---the UUV is able to execute
motions under the guidance of the operator. For example way-points could
be set to which the UUV will travel with no further input from the
operator.

3\. **[[Conditional Autonomy]{.underline}]{.mark}**---the UUV generates
task strategies, but requires a human to select which one to undertake.
For example, when exploring an environment, the UUV may identify several
different routes to take, with the human selecting the most appropriate
one.

4\. **[[High Autonomy]{.underline}]{.mark}**---the UUV can plan and
execute missions based on a set of boundary conditions specified by the
operator. The operator does not require to select which one the UUV
should do, however they are there to oversee the task execution.

5\. [**[Full Autonomy]{.underline}**---]{.mark}[the UUV [requires **no
human input**]{.mark} at all. It is [deployed **in**]{.mark}to [the
**environment**]{.mark} and left [with **no**]{.mark} **operator
[oversight]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Table
2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7663020/table/sensors-20-06203-t002/) shows
current mission activities that are undertaken by UUVs and their levels
of autonomy. Inspection tasks are currently conducted in all
environments except for modern nuclear storage facilities. Limited
maintenance and repair activities are conducted in legacy nuclear
storage ponds, liquid storage tanks and on offshore assets. [[The
**highest level of autonomy** achieved is **1**]{.underline}]{.mark},
where the UUV is able to automate basic functions, such as staying at a
given depth. [[There are **no autonomous activities**]{.mark}

The **[Spanish]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[British]{.underline}** [empires dominated the world]{.underline} in
large part [by]{.underline} **[dominating the oceans]{.underline}**.
Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan were major sea powers during World War
II by adding submarines to their surface fleets.

That [combination remains the key to sea power today]{.underline},
[dominated by the]{.underline} **[U.S. Navy]{.underline}**, with 68
nuclear-powered submarines, 11 aircraft carriers, and more than 450
other ships like destroyers, cruisers, and support ships.

[In recent years]{.underline}, **[China]{.underline}** [has overtaken
the U.S. in numbers, with more than 500 ships]{.underline}, [including
75 submarines and three aircraft carriers, of which about half has been
built since 2010]{.underline}. Still, **[China's]{.underline}**
[open-ocean naval capability lags]{.underline} [**far behind** the
U.S.]{.underline} No other navy in the world comes close to the U.S. or
China. [Now [a **new era** in naval power is
emerging]{.mark}]{.underline} --- **[unmanned vehicles]{.underline}**.

Nearly two decades into the 21st Century, [both nations are
putting]{.underline} **[significant effort]{.underline}** [into adding
autonomous and semi-autonomous platforms to their surface and subsurface
naval forces]{.underline}. The [underwater realm]{.underline} is the
most difficult because of the limitations of underwater communications,
which [makes]{.underline} **[[some form of artificial
intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark}** (AI) [mandatory]{.underline}.

China has been uncharacteristically open about its intentions for AI,
from an announced underwater city inhabited and operated entirely by
robots to official government goals of capitalizing on AI to transform
their military into the strongest in the world.

While [Chinese government spending on AI research is **far
greater**]{.underline} [than that of the U.S]{.underline}., however, a
large percentage of global effort is coming from the U.S. commercial
sector, on which the Pentagon relies heavily for technology advances.
Still, [Chinese companies also are increasing their AI
investments.]{.underline}

The [influence of **massive spending**]{.underline} [on]{.underline}
developing [AI for undersea systems [portends the **greatest
change**]{.mark} in military sea power since the introduction of
nuclear-powered vessels.]{.underline}

"Equipping our military vessels with a higher-level of artificial
intelligence is the answer to the increasing size and complexity of data
to be processed as well as the need to reduce staff," says Dominique
Giannoni, an executive at Thales Underwater Systems in Valbonne, France.

**[China]{.underline}** [autonomous undersea]{.underline}
[efforts]{.underline}

In a rare July 2018 interview with the South
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} Morning Post, Lin Yang, director of a
classified program at the Shenyang Institute of Automation in Shenyang,
China, says her country has [[plans to develop new-generation military
underwater robots]{.underline}]{.mark} by 2021. His 912 Project's goal
is to develop AI-driven unmanned submarines to handle surveillance, mine
laying, and attack missions.

Western China-watchers say the [Chinese navy has **several AI-enabled
vessels**]{.underline} in development --- [with a focus on **autonomous
submarines**]{.underline} --- as [part of a major push to overtake U.S.
dominance in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.]{.underline} That
includes 100-foot long extra-large unmanned underwater vehicles (XLUUVs)
intended for deployment early in the next decade.

Another civilian project is China's most ambitious undersea AI effort to
date, with significant military potential. In [2018, China announced it
was working on an **AI-run underwater base**, equipped with autonomous
submarines to extend its reach]{.underline}.

According to published reports, the [submarines would deploy for
investigation and scientific surveillance missions, then return to the
unmanned base to download data and recharge]{.underline}. The base
itself, located on the ocean floor as deep as 36,000 feet, also would
conduct research on the immediate area, process and fuse all collected
data, and transmit the results to a surface ship or land station.

No location for the base or a timetable for its deployment have been
released, but, given the speed with which China is developing AI across
the board, and especially for undersea applications, the first elements
are expected in the near future.

While being promoted as a major advance in research on undersea life and
topography[, the military potential of such long-endurance unmanned
cooperative systems cannot be ignored.]{.underline}

[China must]{.underline} "grasp the changes of national security
circumstances, [speed up preparations for military
struggl]{.underline}e, including battle planning, [capacity building and
command system building]{.underline}," Chinese President Xi Jinping said
in a speech during a naval inspection in Qingdao, China, according to
China Daily.

[**Russia** also is putting **considerable effo**rt into
AI]{.underline}, but is not believed to be anywhere near the level of
the U.S. or China.

**[U.S]{.underline}**. autonomous undersea **[programs]{.underline}**

The 2020 Pentagon budget request cites advances of potential adversaries
in asking for major funding increases for autonomous weapons programs.
Requests include a [ten-fold increase in spending on large unmanned
surface vessels]{.underline} by the Navy and more than 50 percent more
for Army robotics development. The requests total \$3.7 billion on
unmanned systems across the services, plus another \$900 million on AI.

The Embracing Artificial Intelligence in Undersea Warfare session at the
Navy Submarine League's Submarine Technology Symposium in May summarized
the U.S. Navy's increasing focus on AI --- especially undersea:

"[As the current submarine force trusts mechanical and electrical
technology to execute the mission]{.underline}, [the future force will
**need to trust AI**]{.underline} [to extract and exploit actionable
patterns among an ocean of data]{.underline}," the session says. "The
advent of big data and deep learning technology has rendered signal
detection and classification an increasingly automated process.
[Furthermore, advances in autonomous navigation have enabled **unmanned
platforms to operate alone or in swarms.**]{.underline}

"[[It will be]{.underline} **[critical]{.underline}**]{.mark} for the
21st century [[that the]{.mark} undersea [fleet **advance**]{.mark} **in
[its AI capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [develop algorithms that
are intuitive and explainable, cultivate users' trust in
AI]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [design]{.underline} **[future
systems]{.underline}** [around the use of AI]{.underline}. Meanwhile, we
must also recognize our adversaries' disruptive AI capabilities and
develop appropriate countermeasures against them."

[Despite]{.underline} technological [strides]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} **[AI]{.underline}**, [[unmanned maritime vessels face
a host of new and potentially disabling challenges]{.underline} ---
**[especially in underwater applications]{.underline}**]{.mark}. A 2014
Rand Corp. research paper on Designing Unmanned Systems with Greater
Autonomy looked at how AI is being implemented --- and researched for
future application --- across the board for unmanned systems. The report
also noted the unique challenges facing UUV autonomy.

"[Achieving]{.underline} and maintaining **[communication]{.underline}**
[with underwater vehicles]{.underline} and even with surface vehicles
[is]{.underline} technically **[challenging]{.underline}**, especially
at longer ranges. [Water attenuates radio waves and other wireless
signals that can easily be used at long range in air-to-ground or
air-to-air communications]{.underline}," the report stated. "This means
that high-bandwidth communications underwater are largely impractical
using traditional communication technologies."

"Although there has been some experimentation with laser communications
for underwater applications, laser communications systems are expensive
and consume considerable amounts of power. [Because of these
communications limitations, [UUVs that do not require continuous
communications links are essential]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example,
[autonomous path planning is **needed to avoid underwater obstacles**
and unanticipated terrain features."]{.underline}

Whether a conviction under this statute requires possession of all (as
opposed to any) of the chemicals or equipment necessary to manufacture
methamphetamine under some manufacturing process is a matter of
statutory construction. First, we examine the language of the statute,
itself. United States v. Health Possibilities, P.S.C., 207 F.3d 335,
338-39 (6th Cir.2000) (\"The starting point in a statutory
interpretation case is the language of the statute itself.\").
Obviously, the multiple manufacturing methods and the availability of a
broad range of readily available chemicals and equipment necessary for
each manufacturing process militates against itemizing within the
statute all of the possible chemical and equipment combinations by which
methamphetamine could be manufactured. Nevertheless, KRS 218A.1432(1)(b)
does not read \"\[p\]ossesses chemicals or equipment,\" or
\"\[p\]ossesses some of the chemicals or equipment,\" or \"\[p\]ossesses
any of the chemicals or equipment.\" It reads \"\[p\]ossesses the
chemicals or equipment for the manufacture of methamphetamine.\" **[The
presence of the article \"the\" is significant]{.underline}** because,
grammatically speaking, possession of some but not all of the chemicals
or equipment does not satisfy the statutory language. \"[[The]{.mark}\"

[[**Machine learning** automates **analytical model
building**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It uses methods from neural networks,
statistics, operations research and physics to find hidden insights in
data without being explicitly programmed where to look or what to
conclude.

A neural network is a kind of machine learning inspired by the workings
of the human brain. It's a computing system made up of interconnected
units (like neurons) that processes information by responding to
external inputs, relaying information between each unit. The process
requires multiple passes at the data to find connections and derive
meaning from undefined data.

Deep learning uses huge neural networks with many layers of processing
units, taking advantage of advances in computing power and improved
training techniques to learn complex patterns in large amounts of data.
Common applications include image and speech recognition.

Computer vision relies on pattern recognition and deep learning to
recognize what's in a picture or video. When machines can process,
analyze and understand images, they can capture images or videos in real
time and interpret their surroundings.

Natural language processing is the ability of computers to analyze,
understand and generate human language, including speech. The next stage
of NLP is natural language interaction, which allows humans to
communicate with computers using normal, everyday language to perform
tasks.

[While machine learning is based [on the idea that **machines should be

It is simple: because [[ML is **only** a]{.mark} contributing **[branch
of AI]{.mark}**.]{.underline} If we follow Norvig and Russell book -and
other authors-, [[saying that]{.mark} **[m]{.mark}**achine
**[l]{.mark}**earning [is equivalent to **a**]{.mark}rtificial
**[i]{.mark}**ntelligence [is]{.mark} grossly [misleading. ML is a
**contributing discipline** of AI]{.mark}, just like **search**,
**reasoning**, **planning**, **decision making**, **natural language
processing**, **vision**, and **robotics**.]{.underline}

For instance, [[ML]{.mark} by itself **[cannot be intelligent]{.mark}**
because **lacks reasoning**, **planning**, **logic**, and **doesn't
interact with the environment**]{.underline}. ML detects patterns and
performs predictions based on statistical analysis of data using math
based algorithms[. These **algorithms are not intelligent** per
se.]{.underline}

[**Intelligence is much more** than that.]{.underline}

Stating that ML is part of AI dramatically lowers the bar of what John
McCarthy meant by AI. Chapter two of the AIAMA (Artificial Intelligence:
A Modern Approach) book -which counts five editions- contains examples
and schematics of what an AI agent is. In essence, an AI agent perceives
its environment by means of sensors, and acts upon the environment
through actuators; in between these two, there is logic, reasoning,
decision making that makes the agent act autonomously, correcting itself
with no human intervention.

The figure is my crude attempt of explaining what the AI contributors
are (brown).

**[\<\<\<FIGURE OMITTED\>\>\>]{.underline}**

Background

Our first instinct would bring us to say Machine Learning is a subset of
Artificial intelligence. Then, starts getting fuzzy and nebulous when we
find papers, articles, posts claiming to be on Artificial intelligence.
You start reading them and turns out they are about Machine Learning or
Data Science. At this point we just don't know, if the author(s) made
the mistake by ignorance (didn't research or read enough literature), or
purposely tried to deceive readers. [**[Commercialism]{.mark}** also
[plays a **huge part**]{.mark} in all this. Although, Machine Learning
has had -still has- tremendous achievements to show,
**[marketing]{.mark} and PR [departments]{.mark}** [prefer to **call
it** **A**]{.mark}rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence.]{.underline}

Books on artificial intelligence DO NOT do that. They are written by
scientists -generally- with strong ethical codes.

So, today's Artificial intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science
atmosphere is charged with false stories, inflated achievements. That's
bad for all of us. Because in the end what we receive is pseudo-science.

Science is hard --- it's supposed to be. Artificial intelligence, at the
top of the food chain, was one of the ultimate frontiers. I'm sure [John
[McCarthy would not agree to qualify a]{.mark} **linear regression**, a
**[neural network]{.mark}**, or a **bare robot**, [as]{.mark} being
**[A]{.mark}**rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence. Of course, [they
could be AI with]{.mark} the **right combination of AI

## 1NC\-\--Semi-Autonomous

#### Interpretation: "Artificial Intelligence" is distinct from semiautonomous weapons

**CRS Report**, 12-01-20**20**, \"Defense Primer: U.S. Policy on Lethal
Autonomous Weapon Systems,\" Congressional Research Service,
https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/IF11150.pdf//jc

Definitions. There is no agreed definition of lethal autonomous weapon
systems that is used in international fora. However, [Department of
Defense Directive ([DODD) 3000.09]{.mark}]{.underline} (the directive),
[which establishes U.S. policy on autonomy in weapons systems, [provides
definitions for]{.mark} different categories of [autonomous
weapon]{.mark} systems for the purposes of the U.S.
militar]{.underline}y[. These definitions are principally grounded in
the role of the human operator with regard to target selection and
engagement decisions, rather than in the technological sophistication of
the weapon system]{.underline}. DODD 3000.09 defines LAWS as "weapon
system\[s\] that, once activated, can select and engage targets without
further intervention by a human operator." This concept of autonomy is
also known as "human out of the loop" or "full autonomy." The directive
contrasts LAWS with humansupervised, or "human on the loop," autonomous
weapon systems, in which operators have the ability to monitor and halt
a weapon's target engagement. Another category is semi-autonomous, or

like a menu that we can order from. Semi-autonomous weapons have at
least one, if not three, of these functions. For instance, we might say
that the Samsung SGR-1 has an \"autonomous\" targeting function (through

triggering, as it is a sentry-bot mounted on a defensive perimeter.

#### Interpretation: Artificial Intelligence is different from autonomous robotics

Mike **Ball**, 11-12-20**20**, "Artificial Intelligence vs Autonomy for
Mobile Robotics," Unmanned Systems Technology,
<https://www.unmannedsystemstechnology.com/2020/11/artificial-intelligence-vs-autonomy-for-mobile-robotics///jc>

[[Autonomy and artificial intelligence (AI) are often used
interchangeably in conversation]{.underline}]{.mark} and in the media.
[[These two]{.mark} concepts, [however, are quite different]{.mark} in
practice.]{.underline} Understanding the difference between AI and
autonomy will help your company to make the most practical choices for
greater productivity now and in the future. At Inertial Sense, we
specialize in integrating AI, machine learning and autonomous systems to
create the right solutions for our clients' autonomous robotic systems
needs. Artificial Intelligence vs. Autonomy Artificial intelligence
applications and autonomy are both valuable tools in the industrial
environment. These technologies can be used independently or can work
together to achieve the desired results. Here's an easy way to breakdown
the differences between the two: autonomous robotics = task completion
and AI = problem-solving. [[Autonomous robotics systems are designed
for]{.mark} use in predictable environments to complete tasks within a
specific, usually [pre-planned, environment]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Sensors are of critical importance in providing robots with detailed and
accurate information about their location within the domain. [Autonomous
robotics systems rely on these sensors to navigate their environments
and to perform their tasks quickly and effectively]{.underline}.
Autonomous devices and systems can be powered by conventional software
or by AI systems that allow them to learn and adapt as they operate.
[[Artificial intelligence is defined by Yale University as]{.mark}
"building [systems that]{.mark} can solve complex tasks in ways that
would [traditionally need human intelligence]{.mark}."]{.underline} This
typically involves machine learning technologies and the use of highly
advanced sensors to collect information about the environment and to
allow the system to react appropriately to external stimuli.

The vision of populating the world with autonomous systems that reduce
human labor and improve safety is gradually becoming a reality[.
Autonomous systems have changed]{.underline} the way space exploration
is conducted and are beginning to transform everyday life with a range
of household products. In many areas, however, there are considerable
barriers to the deployment of fully autonomous systems. [[We refer to
systems that require some degree of human intervention]{.mark} in order
to complete a task [as semi-autonomous systems]{.mark}. [We]{.mark}
examine the broad rationale for semi-autonomy and [define basic
properties of such systems]{.mark}.]{.underline} Accounting for the
human in the loop presents a considerable challenge for current planning
techniques. [We examine various design choices in the development of
semi-autonomous systems and their implications on planning and

for advancing the science of semi-autonomy.

### C/I -- Semi-Autonomous systems

#### C/I: All AI is semiautonomous

Travis N **Rieder et al**, 06-xx-20**20**, \"Artificial Intelligence in
Service of Human Needs: Pragmatic First Steps Toward an Ethics for
Semi-Autonomous Agents,\" PubMed,
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32228385///jc

[The ethics of robots and artificial intelligence (AI) typically centers
on \"giving ethics\" to as-yet imaginary AI with human-levels of
autonomy]{.underline} in order to protect us from their potentially
destructive power. It is often assumed that to do that, we should
program AI with the true moral theory (whatever that might be), much as
we teach morality to our children. This paper argues that the focus on
AI with human-level autonomy is misguided. [The robots and **AI that we
have now and in the near future are \"semi-autonomous\"** in that their
ability to make choices and to act is limited across a number of
dimension]{.underline}s. Further[, it may be morally problematic to
create AI with human-level autonomy,]{.underline} even if it becomes
possible. As such, any useful approach to AI ethics should begin with a
theory of giving ethics to semi-autonomous agents (SAAs). In this paper,
we work toward such a theory by evaluating our obligations to and for
\"natural\" SAAs, including nonhuman animals and humans with developing
and diminished capacities. [Drawing on research in neuroscience,
bioethics, and philosophy, we identify the ways in which AI
semi-autonomy differs from semi-autonomy in humans and nonhuman
animals.]{.underline} We conclude on the basis of these comparisons that
when giving ethics to SAAs, we should focus on principles and
restrictions that protect human interests, but that we can only
permissibly maintain this approach so long as we do not aim at
developing technology with human-level autonomy.

### W/M -- PGM specific

https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2019/10/7/pentagon-contemplating-role-of-ai-in-missile-defense//jc

[Artificial intelligence is expected to play a critical role in helping

according to experts. Traditional types of ballistic missiles are being
superseded by [more advanced systems]{.underline}. They
[include]{.underline} more maneuverable and [precision-guided ballistic
missiles]{.underline}, low-flying cruise missiles and hypersonic weapons
that can travel at speeds of Mach 5 or faster, Missile Defense Agency
Director Vice Adm. Jon Hill noted Oct. 7 during remarks at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. "The
unpredictability ... is very challenging," he said. "It challenges your
sensor architecture, it challenges your fire control and it challenges
the methods by which you engage. So I do believe that we are at an
inflection point in how we\'re going to defend not only the homeland,
but our forward-deployed forces and our friends and allies. And we have
to think differently." [AI can help the Defense Department as it tries
to tackle the problem,]{.underline} he said.

#### Prefer it as it is within the context of the topic

Abhijit **Singh**, 09-21-20**16**, \"Is China Really Building Missiles
With Artificial Intelligence?,\" No Publication,
<https://thediplomat.com/2016/09/is-china-really-building-missiles-with-artificial-intelligence///jc>

[With rising security challenges in the global commons, there is growing
interest in the subject of "intelligent" weapons systems.]{.underline}
This is especially so in the maritime realm, where [recent studies have
shown that precision-guided weaponry and networked systems are likely to
play an increasingly important role]{.underline}. Even while accepting
autonomous systems as the future of maritime warfare, however, many find
the subject of "intelligent weapon systems" to be deeply contentious. A
good point of departure for the discussion on autonomous combat systems
is [a recent report]{.underline} in the Chinese media about the
[development of]{.underline} a family of [cruise missiles with
artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.]{.underline} In August this
year, a Chinese daily reported that China's aerospace industry was
developing tactical missiles with inbuilt intelligence that would help
seek out targets in combat. The "plug and play" approach, a Chinese
aerospace executive pointed out, could potentially enable China's
military commanders to launch missiles tailor made for specific combat
conditions. Oddly enough, no clarifications were offered for what
"tailor made cruise missiles with high levels of artificial intelligence
and automation" really meant. Apart from reiterating China's global
leadership status in the field of artificial intelligence, the Chinese
source did not provide any insight into the specific nature of
autonomous capability being developed. The issue for many naval
commanders is the dichotomy between the theoretical definition of
Artificial Intelligence and its popular interpretation. [Technically, AI
is any onboard intelligence that allows machines in combat to execute
regular task]{.underline}s, allowing humans more time to focus on
demanding and complex missions. Modern-day combat requires war-fighters
to operate with the active assistance from sensors and systems. [In
theory, AI provides the technology to augment human analysis and
decision-making by capturing knowledge that can be re-applied in
critical situations.]{.underline} It purports to change the human role
from "in-the-loop" controller to "on-the-loop" thinker who can focus on
a more reflective assessment of problems and strategies, guiding rather
than being buried in execution detail. \[AD OMITTED\] [In practice,
however, Artificial Intelligence is a term used for a combat system that
has the ability to take targeting decisions. This is more in the nature
of "who to target," as opposed to "how to target," which is anyway a
task that guided missiles have been performing with some
precision.]{.underline} It's worth emphasizing that maritime forces
remain skeptical of autonomous weapon systems with independent targeting
capability. In the nautical realm, the launch of a missile on an enemy
platform is an act of war. The decision to execute a missile launch is
the exclusive preserve of the command team (led by the ship's captain),
which must independently assess the threat and act in pursuit of war
objectives. \[AD OMITTED\] Despite several advancements allowing for a
more precise targeting of platforms, the logic of maritime operations
hasn't fundamentally changed. As a result, naval missiles haven't been
invested with any serious intelligence to make command decisions to
target enemy units. While their ability to strike targets has been
radically enhanced --- through the use of superior onboard gyros,
computing systems, and track radars --- the basic mode of operation of
cruise missiles remains the same. To be sure, [Artificial Intelligence
is considered indispensable in the development of new-age naval
weapons]{.underline}, in particular hypersonic missiles. After China's
recent high-speed (over Mach 10), "extreme maneuvers" hypersonic tests,
it is amply clear that future combat missions will require a
human-machine interface on an unprecedented scale; which is why four
other Asian states --- Japan, India, South Korea, and Taiwan --- have
been developing supersonic and hypersonic systems. [Each one of them has
expressed an aspiration for]{.underline} a sophisticated maritime force,
with long range sensors, armor protection[, precision
weapons,]{.underline} and networking technologies. Yet none has been
developing naval missile systems with artificial intelligence.

Until 1971, this term was used mainly in the food industry and
agriculture. At the moment, there are many interpretations of the
concept, but in general they all boil down to one thing: in the
traditional understanding of biotechnology, this is [[an
**interdisciplinary field**]{.mark} that has arisen at the junction of
**biological**, **chemical** and **technical sciences**; it is **[the
use of living organisms and biological processes in industrial
production]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Thus, biotechnology is an integration
of natural and technical sciences that studies the possibilities of
using living organisms and biological processes for the production and
processing of various valuable substances and products. Today,
biotechnology is among the top priorities of scientific and
technological progress, being a vivid example of "high technology". As
noted above, there is no consensus in the literature regarding the
definition of biotechnology as a science. M. Bekker (1979) in his book
"Introduction to Biotechnology" defines biotechnology as a section of
the science of obtaining biosynthesis products. A. Sasson defined
biotechnology [[as a **technological process**]{.mark} implemented using
**biological systems**]{.underline} -- living organisms and living cell
components. By definition, the European Biotechnology Federation (1980),
biotechnology is the combined use of biochemistry, microbiology and
chemical technology for the technological (industrial) use of the
beneficial properties of microorganisms and tissue cultures. In other
words, biotechnology is a human-directed complex of methods for
obtaining society-friendly target products using biological agents of
microorganisms, viruses, animal and plant cells, as well as using
extracellular substances and cell components. These definitions are
mostly correct, but the range of sciences, the practical results of
which are embodied in biotechnology is much broader. In 1983, at the
congress of the socialist countries on biotechnology in Bratislava, the
following definition was made: "biotechnology is [a science [that
develops]{.mark} the **scientific basis** for large-scale
**implementation** of the [processes of **obtaining various
substances**]{.mark}]{.underline} and means of environmental protection
using biocatalysts". At the moment, there is no consensus in
understanding biotechnology. It is interpreted as [a set of **methods
and techniques** for obtaining **products and phenomena** that are
[**useful to humans** with the help of **biological
agents**]{.mark};]{.underline} special social activities of human
transformation of the world and himself through the use of biological
processes and agents; the science "about the methods of obtaining target
products using biosynthesis, controlled by environmental parameters or
genetic engineering manipulations, or a combination of these effects".

biotechnology was an artisanal skill rather than a science, exemplified
in the manufacture of wines, beers, cheeses, etc. where the techniques
of manufacture were well worked out and reproducible, while the
biological mechanisms were not understood. As the scientific basis of
these biotechnology processes has developed this has led to more
efficient manufacturing of the traditional processes that still

been further revolutionised by a range of new molecular biology
innovations, allowing unprecedented molecular changes to be made to
living organisms. The increasing understanding of genomics and
proteomics has led to the creation of a vast range of transgenic
microorganisms, agricultural (genetically modified) crops and animals,
and major new recombinant protein drugs, and has revolutionised
activities in the traditional food and drinks industries. In the
environment, biotechnology innovations are creating major advances in
water and land management and also remediating the pollution generated

The concept of "biotechnology"

The formation of the terminological system of the innovation-technical
discourse is directly related to [the term
**[biotech]{.mark}**nology]{.underline}, which comes from the Greek
words bios --- life, techne --- art, logos --- word, teaching, science.
Today, this concept underlies a significant part of innovative research
and it is present in the overwhelming majority of scientific papers in
this disciplinary segment. The concept of "biotechnology" [[**appeared**
in]{.mark} our **[language]{.mark}** relatively
**[recently]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The term "biotechnology" proposed in
1917 by K. Ereki meant "types of work in which certain products are
produced from raw materials using living organisms". Despite the
capacious reflection of the essence of the technology, such an
[[**understanding** did not stick]{.mark}, and therefore the term was
used in **two ways** for a long time]{.underline}: some used it in
connection with the fermentation process, others meant the person and
his practical activity in order to optimize tools, conditions and the
labor process. [Until 1971, this term was used mainly in the **food
industry** and **agriculture**. At the moment, there are [**many
interpretations** of the concept]{.mark}]{.underline}, but in general
they all boil down to one thing: in the traditional understanding of
biotechnology, this is an interdisciplinary field that has arisen at the
junction of biological, chemical and technical sciences; it is the use
of living organisms and biological processes in industrial production.
Thus, biotechnology is an integration of natural and technical sciences
that studies the possibilities of using living organisms and biological
processes for the production and processing of various valuable
substances and products. Today, biotechnology is among the top
priorities of scientific and technological progress, being a vivid
example of "high technology". As noted above, [there is [**no
consensus** in the **literature**]{.mark} regarding the **definition of
biotechnology**]{.underline} as a science. M. Bekker (1979) in his book
"Introduction to Biotechnology" defines biotechnology as a section of
the science of obtaining biosynthesis products. A. Sasson defined
biotechnology as a technological process implemented using biological
systems -- living organisms and living cell components. By definition,
the European Biotechnology Federation (1980), biotechnology is the
combined use of biochemistry, microbiology and chemical technology for
the technological (industrial) use of the beneficial properties of
microorganisms and tissue cultures. In other words, biotechnology is a
humandirected complex of methods for obtaining society-friendly target
products using biological agents of microorganisms, viruses, animal and
plant cells, as well as using extracellular substances and cell
components. These definitions are mostly correct, but the range of
sciences, the practical results of which are embodied in biotechnology
is much broader. In 1983, at the congress of the socialist countries on
biotechnology in Bratislava, the following definition was made:
"biotechnology is a science that develops the scientific basis for
large-scale implementation of the processes of obtaining various
substances and means of environmental protection using biocatalysts". At
the moment, [there is **no consensus** in **[understanding
biotechnology]{.mark}**. It is [interpreted as a **set of methods** and
**techniques**]{.mark}]{.underline} for obtaining products and phenomena
that are useful to humans with the help of biological agents; special
social activities of human transformation of the world and himself
through the use of biological processes and agents; the science "about
the methods of obtaining target products using biosynthesis, controlled
by environmental parameters or genetic engineering manipulations, or a
combination of these effects". Based on the analysis of existing
definitions, it can be concluded that the definition of biotechnology
given in the late 1970s is basically correct. As we can see from the
presented definitions, [**the term "biotechnology**" [has **two
meanings**]{.mark}: on the one hand, it is the **science of using
biotechnological processes in production**, on the other, it is a
**complex scientific and technical direction** that studies these
processes]{.underline}. Thus, in the mid-70s of the twentieth century,
the term "biotechnology" appeared, which immediately filled in the pages
of academic and popular publications. It should be noted that
biotechnology science is served exclusively by English terminology,
although the development of scientific research in the field of
biotechnology is not a priority for the Anglo-American community. The
analysis of English biotechnology terminology causes a growing interest
of scientists, since it is a young term system, which is at the stage of
formation due to the high level of innovation and dynamism of
biotechnology. Therefore, the study of the general tendencies of the
definition of the term "biotechnology" in the English and Russian
languages and its individual features is interesting, in our opinion,
from both theoretical and practical points of view. As noted above, the
term unit biotechnology (biotechnology), despite belonging to the basic
terms of innovative technical discourse, does not have an established
definition in either English or Russian. Despite the fact that one of
the basic requirements for the term is its uniqueness, examples of
definitions of the term unit biotechnology (biotechnology), selected
from dictionaries and glossaries, can cast doubt on this condition for
the existence of special lexical units. Consider the following
definitions: 1) Biotechnology -- the use of a living organism to solve
an engineering problem or perform an industrial task. 2) Biotechnology
is the use of biological processes, organisms, or systems to manufacture
products intended to improve the quality of human life. 3) Biotechnology
-- the manipulation (through genetic engineering) of living organisms or
their components to produce useful usually commercial products (such as
pest resistant crops, new bacterial strains, or novel pharmaceuticals);
4) Biotechnology -- techniques that use living organisms or parts of
organisms to produce a variety of products (from medicines to industrial
enzymes) to improve plants or animals or to develop microorganisms to
remove toxics from bodies of water, or act as pesticides; 5)
Biotechnology -- the use of bacteria and plant and animal cells for
industrial or scientific purposes, for example to make drugs or
chemicals; 6) Biotechnology -- techniques that use living organisms or
parts of organisms to produce a variety of products (from medicines to
industrial enzymes) to improve plants or animals or to develop
microorganisms to remove toxics from bodies of water, or act as
pesticides; 7) Biotechnology is technology that utilizes biological
systems, living organisms or parts of this to develop or create
different products; 8) Biotechnology: the fusion of biology and
technology, the application of biological techniques to product research
and development. 9) Biotechnology, the use of biology to solve problems
and make useful products. The most prominent area of biotechnology is
the production of therapeutic proteins and other drugs through genetic
engineering.

Conclusions

As we can see from a small number of examples, [**the term
biotechnology** is **[by no means unambiguous]{.mark}**]{.underline},
and the reason lies not only in the difference in the wording and its
prevalence, but also in the selection of the relevant features of the
concept when creating the definition. In most of the definitions, the
definition is based on the use of living organisms or their components
for the production of products designed to improve the quality of life
of people. Other definitions emphasize that biotechnology is a
technology that combines biology and technology that uses biological
systems, living organisms or their fragments to develop or create
various products. In almost all definitions, the idea of the benefits of
biotechnology is expressed, namely: biotechnology is used to obtain
useful products for society with the help of biological agents of
microorganisms, viruses, animal and plant cells; creating useful
products (from drugs to industrial enzymes); to improve plants or
animals; to solve engineering and industrial problems, etc. It should be
noted that almost all definitions have a different nuclear seme or genus
and species trait: science (science); technology; manipulation;
techniques; use; area. [Such **differences** in the **definition of the
key term** of the **biotechnology sphere** confirm the proposition that
the **definitions of concepts** in any science are **temporary** and,
depending on the development of the latter, **can be
transformed**]{.underline}. So, in the presented examples of the
definition of one term "biotechnology", we tried to demonstrate the
diversity of definitional variations of the term in its static
(vocabulary) manifestation at the initial stage of the formation of
terminology, i.e. on the way to the formation of the term system. This
fact indicates the dynamic structure of the term, the development of the
denotation, the concept and signification. [[The **terminology**]{.mark}
**of biotechnology** [is **not fully formed** and **needs to be
standardized**]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to provide the recipient
with information about the concept reflected in the definition.

While [**[you might think]{.mark}** that [biotech]{.mark}nology
[and]{.mark} bio[engineering]{.mark} [are]{.mark} pretty much [the
same]{.mark}]{.underline} thing, [[they]{.mark} do
[have]{.mark}]{.underline} some **[[important
differences]{.underline}]{.mark}** to know about. This is especially
important if you want to start a career in either field because it will
help you to choose the best one. What are examples of biotechnology and
bioengineering? You can find examples of both of these around you. Just
look at a glass of wine -- technology used to produce wine was developed
by biotechnologists. Similarly, if you need an ultrasound, this is an
example of bioengineering. With that in mind, let's explore both
biotechnology and bioengineering in greater detail. We'll start by
looking at some important differences between them. Contents \[show\]
[**The Main Differences Between Biotech And Bioengineering**
[Biotech]{.mark}nology [is focused on **life
science**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its aim is [to create and develop
products]{.underline} that can be [useful in various industries, such
as]{.underline} the [food and medical]{.underline} industries. It makes
use of biological systems to create useful products.
[[Biotech]{.mark}nology [concentrates on living organisms]{.mark} and
how they can be applied to medicine, technology, agriculture, and
business. [Bioengineering]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[on the other
hand]{.underline}**, [makes use of engineering
principles]{.underline}]{.mark} [to solve problems]{.underline} that
arise in medicine as well as biology. It makes use of engineering
methods and scientific concepts to find solutions. Although they are a
bit different, the two are definitely connected! [[Biotech]{.mark}nology
**[makes use of tech]{.mark}nology**]{.underline} when studying and
using biological systems. On the other hand, [[bioengineering relates
to]{.mark} designing and **[transforming the tech]{.mark}nology [in
biotech]{.mark}nology**]{.underline}. To see how this would work in real
life, we can say that [[biotech]{.mark}nology [creates the cells]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} will [develop pharmaceutical drugs.
Bioengineering]{.mark}, on the other hand, develops a process that will
[ensure]{.mark} those [drugs can be **produced
faster**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Now that we've analyzed the main
definitions of both biotechnology and bioengineering, we can explore
both of them in greater detail. Let's start with biotechnology! The Four
Main Types Of Biotechnology [Biotechnology has]{.underline} four main
types. These are: [Medical biotechnology]{.underline}, which is focused
on using living cells to create new technologies to improve human
health. It also makes use of studying DNA to identify genetic disorders
and find ways to treat them. Various developments in medical
biotechnology include the development of antibiotics and vaccines.
[Agricultural biotechnology]{.underline}, which involves developing
genetically-modified plants to increase crop yield. An example would be
GM crops that are pest-resistant or can grow during droughts. This type
of biotechnology also involves finding other ways to make crops
healthier, such as by boosting their nutritional value. This can help to
deal with the world's hunger problem. [Industrial
biotechnolog]{.underline}y, which makes use of technology for industrial
purposes to improve manufacturing processes. It basically makes use of
microorganisms and enzymes to create products to make the processes
smoother. [Environmental biotechnology]{.underline}, which uses
technology to improve the environment. This can take the form of finding
innovative ways for waste treatment or the prevention of air, land, and
water contaminants. THERE ARE MANY OTHER TYPES OF BIOTECHNOLOGY! The
four previous types of biotech aren't the only ones -- with
biotechnology growing and influencing many different fields and sectors,
there are always new ones hitting the scene. Examples of other types of
biotechnology include biotechnology in food production and biotechnology
that focuses on marine resources. You can find out more about all the
types of biotechnology by reading the article "Types of Biotechnology
Explained: 4 Biotech Colors." WHAT ARE THE APPLICATIONS OF
BIOTECHNOLOGY? Biotechnology has applications in a variety of sectors,
such as food processing and preservation, agriculture, bio energy,
health and medicine, and waste management. The important thing to
remember is that biotechnology mainly focuses on the natural sciences.
Taking A Closer Look At Bioengineering Taking A Closer Look At
Bioengineering Interestingly, bioengineering and its popularity can be
traced back to electrical engineers of the 1950s. It came about as a way
to find solutions to various needs, such as the need for replacement
organs, as Britannica reports. Some examples of [[bioengineering
include]{.mark} the engineering of bacteria to produce pharmaceutical
drugs and the development of artificial knees and other
joints.]{.underline} Even [[**ultrasounds** and]{.mark} other types of
**[medical imaging]{.mark} techniques** are examples of
bioengineering]{.underline}, which just goes to show how it's had such a
huge impact on our lives. [There are exciting developments in
bioengineering]{.underline} currently underway, [such as robotics,
**[genetic engineering, and neural engineering.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
Bioengineers are usually employed by a variety of different
institutions, such as pharmaceutical companies, medical research
institutions, and regulatory agencies. WHAT ARE THE APPLICATIONS OF
BIOENGINEERING? Bioengineering engineering is a field that mainly
concerns itself with principles of engineering, such as mechanical,
electrical, or chemical engineering, basic sciences such as physics, as
well as biotechnology in the form of genetic engineering and tissue
engineering. THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF BIOENGINEERING [Bioengineering
uses]{.underline} what biological theory there is to solve problems in
the world. It either makes use of biological systems that are already
present or it changes them to enhance or improve their effects. There
are many different types, or branches, of bioengineering. Let's take a
look at them. **[[Medical engineering]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This has
the focus of applying engineering principles to medical problems, such
as finding ways to replace or heal damaged organs with the use of
engineering techniques. [Agricultural engineering.]{.underline} This
puts engineering principles to work by using them to solve problems
related to biological production and the environment.
[Bionics]{.underline}. This concerns the study of living systems so that
all the knowledge gained from them can be used to design physical
systems. An example of this is the use of prosthetic limbs that can be
controlled with artificial intelligence. [Biochemical
engineering.]{.underline} This applies engineering principles to
microscopic biological systems that create new products, such as
producing protein from raw materials. Another example of biochemical
engineering is the development of agricultural chemicals to treat and
develop food for human consumption. [Human-factors
engineering]{.underline}. In human-factors engineering, principles of
engineering, psychology, and physiology are applied to the human-machine
relationship. In other words, those principles are applied to machines
that are designed for our use. An example of human-factors engineering
is the creation of the telephone and space suit. [Environmental health
engineering]{.underline}. This is when engineering principles are
applied to the control of the environment, with the aim of increasing
human beings' health, safety, and comfort. An example includes
life-support systems for space exploration. **[Genetic
engineering.]{.underline}** This is all about changing organisms, and
it's focused on manipulating DNA or other nucleic acid molecules. This
has already led to various products that can help people, such as the
development of human insulin to control diabetes.
[Biomimicry.]{.underline} This is a fascinating type of bioengineering,
which is also known as biomimetics. It applies natural systems to solve
complicated engineering problems. An example is how scientists have
mimicked the design of termite mounds to create more energy-efficient
buildings. This has been adopted in Zimbabwe, with what's known as The
Eastgate Building. This commercial block of offices is combined with a
shopping mall, but it makes use of internal climate control by its
design being similar to that of a termite mound. This makes use of
natural processes to ensure that inside the building it's warm during
winter and cool during summer, as Environmental Science explains.

The term biotechnology is derived from a fusion of biology and
technology. [Biotechnology means any technological application that uses
biological systems, living organisms or derivatives thereof, to make or
modify products or processes for specific use.]{.underline} · The term
biotechnology was coined in 1917 by a Hungarian Engineer, Karl Ereky to
describe a process for large scale production of pigs. · [Biotechnology

[The Convention on Biological Diversity defines biotechnology as \'any
technological application that uses biological systems, living
organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or
processes for specific use\']{.underline} (CBD, 2000). [It therefore
includes all forms of plant and animal breeding, traditional food
fermentation and waste treatment. The term biotechnology can be defined
as \"the application of science to biological organisms to give new and
improved agricultural and industrial production\".]{.underline} The
application of biotechnology to farm animals is exciting; offering a
mechanism whereby genetic material isolated from any animal, plant or
bacterial source can be transferred to a recipient animal resulting in
the altered activity of an existing gene within the animal or the
production of a new gene product from the animal. The application of
biological techniques to food crops, animals and microorganisms opens
the possibilities to improve the quality, quantity, safety, ease of
processing and production economics of food (IFST, 2004). Biotechnology
in the food processing sector targets the selection and improvement of
microorganisms with the objectives of improving process control, yields
and efficiency as well as the quality, safety and consistency of
bio-processed products.

As a part of this initiative, AmCham China hopes to provide insight on
the fundamentals and applications of specific technologies through
varied content. One technology driving the incredible motion of
innovation forward is biotechnology. [The Basics Biotechnology generally
refers to "the use of an organism, or component of an organism, for a
specific use,"]{.underline} (Khan Academy). [More specifically,
biotechnology can include the manipulation of tissue, DNA, and desired
effect of an organism's innate functions. Biotechnology is the crossroad
of hardware, software, and the most complicated machines in the world:
living organisms.]{.underline} The relationship between the three is
symbiotic: each supports and relies on the other. The thriving economy
of biotechnology lives at the crossroad of technology and medicine, and
is currently being driven by massive amounts of money and research - by
just March of 2018, US \$2.8 billion was poured into biotech startups
over the year-to-date. Applications of biotechnology are endless, and
can reach us through several avenues. Beer-brewing technology involves
biotechnological processes---fungi in the form of yeast are used in the
fermentation of malted barley sugar. The same type of technology that
makes craft beer has the power to edit DNA. DNA technology is a
biotechnology that involves editing the genome, which acts like a
genetic instruction manual. Applications of DNA in biotechnology are
found in cloning, gel electrophoresis, and DNA sequencing. The human
genome is composed of four base components, much like binary code (which
is composed of two base components). The genome can be treated like
software binary via this similarity, and edited to delete or replace
incorrect DNA sequences. By just 2002, scientists at Watson Labs were
already learning how to code and program DNA - the leap from one base
pair (the 1s and 0s of binary) to two base pairs (ATCG, the building
blocks of DNA) was apparently not too large.

to NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology), it can be
defined as the ability to defend cyberspace usage from cyberattacks.
Cyberspace could be internet, computer systems, telecom networks,

[[relies on **three**]{.mark} **key [areas]{.mark}** namely
[**confidentiality**, **availability** and
**integrity**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[1. ]{.underline}

[**[Confidentiality]{.mark}**: The word confidentiality looks alike
privacy. The key idea is [to **prevent unauthorized users** from
accessing]{.mark} the sensitive [information]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Confidentiality makes sure that only authorized users are given
permission to access sensitive information. Identity theft, credit card
fraud, phishing, wiretapping are some examples of confidentiality
attacks

[2. ]{.underline}

[**[Availability]{.mark}**: Availability refers to [the **genuine access
of resources**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The information should be made
available to the authorized personal. Denial of service attack, Internet
Control Message Protocol flood attacks are some examples of availability
attacks.

[3. ]{.underline}

[[**Integrity**: **Trustworthiness**, **Data consistency** and
**accuracy**]{.mark}]{.underline} are all ensured by integrity. The main
goal is to prevent data modification who aren't authorised to do so. Man
in middle attacks, salami attacks and session hijacking are some
examples of Integrity attacks. (Priyadarshini, I. 2019)

[[A New Definition of Cybersecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}

[We propose the following definition, which [integrates key
concepts]{.mark} drawn from the literature and engagement with the
multidisciplinary group:]{.underline}

**[[Cybersecurity is the organization]{.mark} and collection [of
resources,]{.mark} processes, and structures [used to protect
cyberspace]{.mark} and cyberspace-enabled systems [from occurrences that
misalign de jure from de facto property rights.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

We deconstruct this definition as follows:

\...[**the organization and collection of resources, processes,
and structures**...: This aspect [captures the multiple]{.mark},
interwoven [dimensions]{.mark} and inherent complexity [of
cybersecurity]{.mark}, which ostensibly involve interactions between
humans, between systems, and between humans and systems.]{.underline} By
avoiding discussion of which resources, processes, or structures, the
definition becomes non-prescriptive and recognizes the dynamic nature of
cybersecurity.

...[**used to protect cyberspace and cyberspace-enabled systems**...:
This aspect [includes protection]{.mark}, in the broadest sense, [from
all threats]{.mark}, including intentional, accidental, and natural
hazards.]{.underline} This aspect also incorporates the traditional view
of cyberspace but includes those systems that are not traditionally
viewed as part of cyberspace, such as computer control systems and
cyber-physical systems. By extension, the protection applies to assets
and information of concern within cyberspace and connected systems.

[...**from occurrences**...: This aspect recognizes that \"protections\"
are intended to address the full range of **intentional events**,
**accidental events**, and **natural hazards**.]{.underline} It also
suggests that some of the occurrences are unpredictable.

...that misalign de jure from de facto property rights...: This aspect
incorporates the two separate notions of ownership and control that
dominate discussion of cybersecurity and digital assets introduced in
the property rights framework of Ostrom and Hess (2007), which include
access, extraction, contribution, removal, management, exclusion, and
alienation. Any event or activity that misaligns actual (de facto)
property rights from perceived (de jure) property rights, whether by
intention or accident, whether known or unknown, is a cybersecurity
incident.

## 1NC\-\--Cybersecurity\-\--Electronic Digital Media

#### Cybersecurity necessitates the use of electronic digital media

Nicholas **Bartlett 21**, law degree from University of Toledo, "HONING
IN ON HARDWARE: DATA SECURITY CONCERNS OF LARGE COMPANIES", Winter 2021,
University of Toledo Law Review, Vol. 52, p. 545 /lg

I magine for a moment that you are interested in computers, and you
purchase a couple of old used servers from a company. Once you get home
and access the servers, you notice that one of them is completely full
of sensitive consumer information. This includes names, addresses,
contact information, etc. A few questions should circle your mind at
that point. \"What do I do now? How did this happen?\" Well, in 2006,
this actually occurred. Mark Morris, self-described used computer
dealer, claimed to have found sensitive data on servers from Ernst &
Young. Morris wanted to be paid to remove the data which should have
been wiped before he came into possession of the servers, but Ernst &
Young simply wanted the servers returned to them. This conflict
unsurprisingly resulted in legal proceedings.

This event raises a significant issue: hardware security. Much of the
news today revolves around data breaches that occur from hackers or
people intruding networks remotely. The general public does not hear
much about events like the scenario described above, where someone
discovers a server that was not properly disposed of by the company.
There are a few possibilities for why this is rarely known, but it is
still an important aspect of data security that should be handled with
competence. [Failure to competently secure company data on hard drives
may result in liability either from federal or state securities laws or
common law fiduciary duties. The aftereffects of incompetence can be
just as destructive as a remote security breach.]{.underline} Hefty
fines can be issued if the information was required by law or industry
standard to have been retained by the company. Further, the information
may end up in the wrong hands. Morris was allegedly receiving offers to
purchase the information on the purchased servers for up to \$ 1.2
million. It \[\*546\] would not be at all shocking for a court to be
harsher on a company who negligently handles their hardware when the
entity has complete, direct control over the process as opposed to a
data hack by an outsider.

[While most of the focus in the cybersecurity context today revolves
around protecting the intangible data, directors need to pay equal
attention to the physical devices this data is stored on]{.underline}.
The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) should be issuing further
guidance specifying this need. This guidance should look similar to
state statutes that require companies to develop comprehensive data
security practices and procedures.

While many legal scholars have recently focused on liability resulting
from data breaches, this note focuses exclusively on hardware and what
the SEC should be doing to guide corporations. Specifically, this note
will provide a more nuanced look at how large companies should be
treating their physical hardware, i.e., servers, hard drives, and the
like.

[This note will examine what cybersecurity is and the related issues
facing companies today]{.underline}. It will then transition to an
elaboration on fiduciary duties and their relation to cybersecurity
incidents and hardware concerns. A discussion of current federal and
state laws will follow, along with examples of guidance from other
organizations. Finally, the conclusion will provide a recommendation of
how hardware security should be emphasized and what may be missing from
federal guidance from the SEC. Specifically, the SEC should issue
further guidance and potentially adopt a statute that is designed to
meet the concerns related to physical data breaches.

I. BACKGROUND

a\. Cybersecurity and Potential Liability

A [cyberattack is a willful breach of a company\'s computer systems and
networks]{.underline}. Code is often used to disrupt the normal
operations that can compromise sensitive data and result in consequences
such as identity and information theft. [Cyber threats are constantly
changing and require an expenditure of resources]{.underline} to
continually update data security departments within corporations.
[Cybersecurity can be defined as \"the protection of investor and firm
information from compromise through the use \-- in whole or in part \--
of **electronic**]{.underline} \[\*547\] [**digital
media**.\"]{.underline} The phrase \"data has been compromised\" refers
to loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of that data.
Specifically, a loss of confidentiality indicates disclosure of
information, a loss of integrity means the destruction of information,
and a loss of availability is the interruption of access to information.

The probability of cyber incidents occurring combined with their impact
is referred to as Cyber Risk. [Cyberattacks may be carried out in a
variety of ways, such as by third parties or company insiders using
complex techniques or through traditional social engineering. Attacks
can come remotely in a more stereotypical sense similar to what is seen
on television or they can come through more personal means]{.underline}
by directly interacting with people and gaining information needed to
conduct the cyber-attack. There can be many costs and negative
consequences associated with a data breach:

#### Violation: the affirmative does not require or involve electronic digital media

#### Prefer our interpretation:

#### Neg ground -- failing to specify the technologies used to achieve cybersecurity crushes the potential for disad links

#### Aff ground -- our interpretation allows for protection of physical technological devices, which is usually disregarded

#### Education -- Bartlett uses relevant cybersecurity issues as the basis for his definition

\"necessary and used predominantly\" for cybersecurity purposes.
[Definition of Cybersecurity: CMS finalizes the definition of

the definition of technology to be: \"any software or other types of

comments on the types of donors who should be protected under this
exception. In the Final Rule, CMS declines to finalize limits on the
types of donors protected under this exception; instead, the Final Rule
protects all donors. However, neither the eligibility of a physician for
the technology or services, nor the amount or nature of the technology
or services, should be determined in any manner that directly takes into
account the volume or value of referrals or other business generated
between the parties. CMS declined to include a list of selection
criteria that, if met, would mean a donation would be deemed to meet
this requirement.Recipients: CMS finalizes the proposed requirement that
neither the physician nor the physician\'s practice can make the receipt
of cybersecurity technology or services, or the amount or nature of the
technology or services, a condition of doing business with the
donor.Written requirement: CMS finalizes the requirement that an
arrangement for the provision of cybersecurity technology and related
services be documented in writing.This requirement is fulfilled if
contemporaneous documents would permit a reasonable person to verify
compliance with the exception at the time that a referral is made.No
Monetary Cap: CMS declines to finalize a monetary cap in the Final Rule.

#### Violation: the affirmative is extra topical -- the plan addresses more than cyberattacks

#### Extra topicality is a voter:

#### Fairness -- allowing affirmatives to take untopical actions denies the neg an opportunity to negate the resolution 

#### Topic education -- debates should be confined to the topic of the resolution -- we switch topics for a reason

#### Predictability -- neg teams can't imagine the multitude of affs that aren't a core part of the topic

#### Prefer our interpretation:

#### Limits -- any other interpretation allows for affs that address tangentially related concerns

#### Ground -- the aff-skewed nature of the resolution means that neg teams need the chance to generate links to a core topic area

[[With]{.mark} over **[40 years]{.mark}** of practice, [we]{.mark} now
[have a **better understanding** of]{.mark} the **risks for
[cybersecurity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We have been able to learn from
many different kinds of incidents and attacks. So the risk models that
we can create now are grounded in both theory and practice.

Yet, many practical and academic reports today still use the CIA triad
as the definition of cybersecurity, while many newer approaches exist.
As an example, consider the NIST cybersecurity framework \[3\].

3.1 The NIST Cybersecurity Framework

[[The **NIST cybersecurity**]{.mark} **framework** [is defined
as]{.mark} a set of **[five]{.mark} different
[activities]{.mark}**.]{.underline} These activities are continuous, and
the level to which these are performed depend on the organisation and
its context. They are as follows:

 [**[Identify]{.mark}**: **identify** the **assets that must be
secured** and the context that they are in]{.underline}

[ **[Protect]{.mark}**: **define** and implement **protective measures
for** the **assets**]{.underline}

[ **[Detect]{.mark}**: **put** sensors and **processes in place to
detect when protection has been breached**]{.underline}

[ **[Respond]{.mark}**: **define response processes for** when **an
incident** has been detected]{.underline}

[ **[Recover]{.mark}**: **develop plans for resilience** in the
organisation, as well as **recovery mechanisms**]{.underline}

With the identify activity all assets of an organisation that must be
secured are identified. Creating this overview of all assets facilitates
taking a more generic approach to security when assets are to be
protected. Another important part of the identify activity is to examine
the context of the assets, to consider what the assets must be
protected, but also how the protective measures may impact existing
processes.

[**[Protect]{.mark}** in the framework [is only **one of the
activities**]{.mark} instead of the main focus. This process puts the
protective measures more into perspective and makes them part of an
**overall solution**.]{.underline}

The Detect, Respond, and Recover activities force one to consider that
security is never absolute. Some risks are just too costly to protect
against and instead should be addressed by detection, incident response,
and recovery activities. It also forces one to consider that security is
never perfect, so other measures should be put in place to mitigate
negative consequences of other protective measures that may fail.

3.2 More Appropriate Cybersecurity

[[Addressing cybersecurity as]{.mark} a [an **overarching
activity**]{.mark} instead of a **binary measure** [creates more
**appropriate response**]{.mark}**s on cybersecurity**. Appropriate in
the sense that the defence fits the context and the actual risks
identified **instead of aiming for an absolute defence** for each
individual asset. Approaching cybersecurity as a general activity
[creates a **better overview**]{.mark} and facilitates a **more
concerted effort** with different protectional measures.]{.underline}

[Finally, viewing cybersecurity as a continuous activity [allows]{.mark}
organisations to **[better move with
developments]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Having identified each of the
assets and having already done risk-assessments makes it easier to
re-evaluate these in light of upcoming changes.

### 2AC\-\--C/I\-\--Includes Satellites

#### Cybersecurity is the prevention of damage to, unauthorized use of, or exploitation of [information systems]{.underline} \-\-- includes protection and restoration of [satellites]{.underline}

[The past eighteen to twenty-four months have seen a tectonic shift of
focus]{.underline} (as well as a plethora of industry-generated white
papers) [by virtually every governmental regulatory entity, NGO, and
industry group]{.underline} in the maritime world (up to and [including
the President of the United States]{.underline}) to the amorphous and
dynamic issue of maritime "cybersecurity," a term that covers a large
waterfront of potential threats. The United States Coast Guard ([USCG)
has adopted the following broad definition of "cybersecurity" from the
U.S. Department of Homeland Security]{.underline}. National
Infrastructure Protection Plan, 2013:

[Cybersecurity -- The prevention of damage to, unauthorized use of, or
exploitation of, and]{.underline}, if needed, [the restoration of
electronic information and communications systems and the information
contained therein to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and
availability; **includes** protection and restoration]{.underline}, when
needed, [of]{.underline} information networks and wireline, wireless,
**[satellite]{.underline}**, public safety answering points, and 911
communications systems and control systems.

USCG Cyber Strategy: The U.S. Coast Guard's Vision for Operating in the
Cyber Domain (June 2015).

And with the recent September 2016 roll-out of what has been billed as
the maritime industry's first "cybersecurity" certification program by
the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) -- the USCG's foremost third-party
delegated enforcement entity -- vessel owners and operators would be
well-advised to stay ahead of the ever-sharpening "cybersecurity" curve.

All of the competing (sometimes conflicting) and overlapping aspects of
this ever-and-rapidly changing issue are far beyond the scope of this
blog post. Given that the majority of the focus in this area has tended
toward the traditional blue-water shipping industry (viz. vessels and
ports/terminals), this post will focus on ways that the inescapable
brave new world of maritime cybersecurity is affecting, and will
continue to effect, inland and offshore vessel operators.

### 2AC\-\--C/I\-\--Includes Cybercrime

#### Cybersecurity includes network and information security, the [fight against cybercrime]{.underline}, and cyber defense

Christian **Calliess &** Ansgar **Baumgarten 20**, Professor for Public
and European Law at Freie Universität Berlin, holder of an Ad Personam
Jean-Monnet-Chair, and previous Legal Adviser to the European Political
Strategy Center (EPSC), advising and working under the authority of its
President Jean-Claude Juncker & PhD candidate and scientific assistant
for Dr. Calliess at Freie Universität Berlin, "Cybersecurity in the EU
The Example of the Financial Sector: A Legal Perspective", 2020, German
Law Journal, Vol. 21, p. 1149 /lg

[Alongside space, air, land, and sea, cyber is the fifth
dimension]{.underline}. It opens a global virtual world, radically
changing societies and shaking classical borders. But [a]{.underline}
digital world also comes with new types of micro threats on businesses
and citizens, and macro threats on public policies and state security,
which are asymmetrical, unpredictable, and unaffected by classical state
responses. They occur at \[\*1150\] the level of tricksters and range up
to state espionage and, potentially, offensive cyber-attacks against
states. Cyber is as such a new global world, where there is no dividing
line between external and internal security. There is an attacker in one
country, aiming for a target in another, causing damage in yet a third.
There are as well large-scale attacks targeting and affecting several
Member States at once\--with the actual attack being carried out in
cyberspace, which does not even adhere to one spot, country, or
continent, but is a dimension for itself. This raises the question of
the adequacy, or inadequacy, of the classical regulatory tools to reply
to these challenges.

[In this new environment, the EU and its Member States need to
anticipate and plan for hitherto unimaginable scenarios in which they
would be put if under a severe cyber-attack]{.underline}. This is
particularly true for the implementation of the European Commission\'s
EU Digital Single Market agenda. With the financial industry at its very
center, a digital single market for the free movement of persons,
services, and capital is highly dependent on a reliable and robust IT
infrastructure. Comparable to the field of \"industry 4.0,\" innovation
in the financial sector\--for example, the idea of a \"Digital City,\" a
financial platform of Europe that coordinates a network of financial
centers in the EU \--and the success of new business models depend on
trust in a safe digital environment.

[Cybersecurity is a term that covers a wide range of
activities]{.underline}. Broadly speaking, [it can be divided into three
different categories: Network and information security, **fight against
cybercrime**, and cyber defense]{.underline}. With regard to network and
information security, cybersecurity can be defined as the ability of
network and information systems to resist action that compromises the
availability, authenticity, integrity, or confidentiality of digital
data or the services those systems provide. This Article will focus on
cybersecurity in the financial sector in its dimension of network and
information security. Still, it will also refer to the other two areas
of cybersecurity where necessary and appropriate. The financial sector
is understood as the entirety of payment systems, credit institutions,
payment institutions, stock exchanges, trade repositories, central
securities depositories, central counterparty clearing houses,
securities settlement platforms, credit rating agencies, insurance
companies, and asset management companies.

### 2AC\-\--C/I\-\--Broad + Predictable

#### Cybersecurity can be in the realm of [research domains]{.underline}, [sectors]{.underline}, or [technologies and use cases]{.underline} \-\-- specific to European law

Research Centre in Ispra, Italy who was a Contractual Researcher with

Cybersecurity Taxonomy", 2019, European Comission (executive body of the
EU) /lg

2.3 General Considerations on the analysed sources

The sources presented in the previous section have been used to
identify:

A common set of vocabularies and terms;

A set of specific sub-domains;

A set of applicable sectors.

Ad-hoc desktop research activities have been conducted to identify
relationships among domains, synonyms and to discriminate between
cybersecurity peculiarities and generic items. Table 7 summarises the
contribution provided by all the identified sources to the definition of
the taxonomy presented in section 3.

On the basis of the analysis conducted, it is possible to draw some
general considerations:

The analysed standards provided a good source reference for the
definition of terms, and for the identification of some domain areas
linked to the risk-assessment domain. The same risk-assessment elements
can be found in the resilience function areas defined by NIST and well
as in the NIST CSRC categorisation. When instead coming to the
identification of research domains, the analysed standards can be
considered negligible as conceived to drive a technical standardisation
process in very specific domains and not to classify knowledge and
scientific activities

The NIS directive and the NIST CRSC share, with some variations, a
common understanding of the sectors where cybersecurity must be
considered paramount, hence by merging these two sectorial views it is
possible to identify a relevant element of the taxonomy which will be
presented in Section 3

The taxonomies of IEEE, IFIP, ECSO, ETSI and Cyberwatch.eu often overlap
with the NIST CRSC resulting the better detailed and logically
structured. The merging of these three sources could provide a good
starting point for what concerns the technological and scientific
domains.

[NIST CRSC considers into its categorisation also **law and regulation
aspects**]{.underline}; this is perfectly in line with the scope of the
taxonomy subject of this study, however the [subdomains listed are
obviously **related to the US regulation landscape**, and cannot be
considered as useful to map the EU law and regulation cybersecurity
expertise. However, the NIS directive and the GDPR can be used there to
close the gap]{.underline}

As it is possible to see the identified sources well complement each
other allowing to cover almost all the cybersecurity spectrum. [By using
the identified concepts and leveraging on standards for what concerns
definitions and vocabulary, a more general and **EU oriented** taxonomy
of the cybersecurity and privacy domain is presented in Section
3]{.underline}.

3 Holistic Taxonomy for Cybersecurity Research Domains

The analysis of the reference sources described in the previous section
highlights the complexity and heterogeneity of the cybersecurity
discipline. In a similar situation, in order to ensure capturing every
aspect of this domain, the taxonomy proposed in this document might risk
to become super-specialised, with a multitude of nested domains. [The
goal of the taxonomy proposed in this report is that of supporting the
mapping of the **European cybersecurity** competencies
available]{.underline}. [The goal of the taxonomy is not to support the
mapping of cybersecurity products, services, or processes including
operational activities]{.underline}. The analysis conducted so far
however suggests adopting a different, more agile approach. [The
analysis of the scientific/technological working groups activities (e.g.
IFIP, ETSI etc.) and of the "knowledge management entities" (e.g. ACM,
IEEE etc.) gives a **clear and precise** indication of the **areas of
fundamental research** within the cybersecurity domain.]{.underline}

On the other side, [the analysis of policy documents and regulations
allowed to magnify which sectorial domains are perceived as the most
relevant for the wellbeing of the European Society]{.underline} (the
assumption here is that regulations and policy packages answer to a
precise European citizen and industry regulatory needs).

Finally, [the analysis of the market studies, of the observatory
initiatives and of the R&D programs (H2020), provides an indication of
the field of technologies and use cases where the cybersecurity
foundational research results are applied]{.underline}. Technologies and
uses cases typically involve multiple sectors.

[This reasoning reached the conclusion that a taxonomy trying to cluster
a complex and multifaceted discipline as cybersecurity needs to be
structured on multiple dimensions, capturing not only the **core and
traditional research domains**, but also impacted sectors and
applications.]{.underline}

Figure 5, depicts, in a graphical way, the [proposed three-dimensional
taxonomy]{.underline}, based on the following dimensions:

**[Research domains]{.underline}** represent areas of knowledge related
to different cybersecurity aspects. Given the multidisciplinary nature
of cybersecurity, such domains are intended to cover different areas,
[including human, legal, ethical and technological aspects]{.underline}.

**[Sectors]{.underline}** are proposed to highlight the need for
considering different cybersecurity requirements and challenges (from a
human, legal and ethical perspective) in scenarios, such as [energy,
transport or financial sector]{.underline}.

**[Technologies and Use Cases]{.underline}** represent the technological
enablers to enhance the [development]{.underline} of the different
sectors. They are related to cybersecurity domains covering
technological aspects.

The three-dimensional taxonomy [can be used as a reference to map
cybersecurity competencies]{.underline}, for example, in Figure 5 an
entity working on Cryptology in the Energy sector considering Embedded
Systems is mapped.

Each dimension has been fine-tuned and detailed on the basis of the
analysis presented in the previous section to:

a\) ensure its alignment with the European Regulatory landscape;

b\) ensure its comprehensiveness (merging together where needed
sub-domains highlighted in different classifications and standards);

c\) avoid redundancy of terms and definitions.

In what follows, definitions for each dimension of the proposed taxonomy
are presented. More in details, Subsection 3.1 lists for each of
cybersecurity domains the relevant sub-domains. Subsection 3.2 details
the sectorial sub-domains, and Subsection 3.3 illustrates the list of
technologies and use cases. The taxonomy is completed with the glossary
of concepts and vocabulary included in Annex 1. The cybersecurity
subdomains defined for each domain, sectors and technologies/use cases
are by no means an exhaustive list, these elements will be complemented
in the future based on the input from cybersecurity centre of
excellences surveyed.

\\\\SYang

[[**Defensive cybersecurity** is]{.mark} all about
**[blocking]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This could come in the form of both
tools and actions. You have your defensive tools that are designed to
prevent or mitigate the effects of a cyberattack---such as antivirus
software, firewalls, etc. And then you have your defensive actions,
which include things like patching software and fixing system
vulnerabilities. 

[[**Offensive cybersecurity**,]{.mark} on the other hand, [is]{.mark}
all [about]{.mark} **tackling and [outmaneuvering]{.mark}**[. The
focus]{.mark} here is [on]{.mark} seeking out the hackers, and in some
cases, attempting to [**disable or "hack back**"]{.mark} to **disrupt
[their operations]{.mark}**. **Offensive cybersecurity** can also [help
**identify vulnerabilities**]{.mark} or **weaknesses** in your defense.
It's a slightly [**more proactive approach** to security]{.mark} and can
**include** practices like **penetration** **testing** and **threat
hunting**. ]{.underline}

No matter which side of the field you're on, the goal of any
cybersecurity strategy should always be preventing the hackers (a.k.a.
the opponent) from winning. [But that brings us back to our original
question: [should we be playing offense or defense]{.mark} **in
cybersecurity**?]{.underline}

### 2AC\-\--AT: Excludes Property Rights

#### The property rights interp is too vague, unnecessarily broad, and impedes the success of cybersecurity operations

Derek E. **Bambauer 15**, Professor of Law at the University of Arizona,
where he teaches Internet law and intellectual property (covers Internet
censorship, cybersecurity, and intellectual property) + was a Research
Fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law
School, "Conundrum", 04/11/2015 revision date (originally published

[Conceptualizing cybersecurity challenges policymakers and
academics]{.underline}. 32 [The current theoretical approaches to
cybersecurity]{.underline}, though, [have proved to be significantly
flawed]{.underline}. They employ [definitions that are vague and
overbroad]{.underline}; [they seek to force cybersecurity\'s issues into
the **straitjackets** of existing doctrines **poorly suited to
cybersecurity\'s problems**; and they produce concomitant policy
recommendations that not only fail to mitigate, but actually **worsen,
the Internet\'s security challenges**]{.underline}.

[Conventional wisdom on cybersecurity identifies the problem as
all-encompassing]{.underline}. 33 [Scholars, government officials, and
journalists tend to view cybersecurity as the \"protection of all things
Internet\"]{.underline} 34 - an approach that impedes practical progress
by failing to set priorities. [Government efforts at capturing
cybersecurity\'s scope have been particularly overbroad]{.underline}.
\[\*592\] President Barack H. Obama\'s Cyberspace Policy Review offers a
representative definition, where cybersecurity is:

strategy, policy, and standards regarding the security of and operations
in cyberspace, and encompasses the full range of threat reduction,
vulnerability reduction, deterrence, international engagement, incident
response, resiliency, and recovery policies and activities, including
computer network operations, information assurance, law enforcement,
diplomacy, military, and intelligence missions as they relate to the
security and stability of the global information and communications
infrastructure. 35

Presidential policies have been strikingly consistent. President Barack
Obama\'s approach to cybersecurity is almost identical to the
Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI), the strategy
employed by Obama\'s Republican predecessor, President George W. Bush.
36 Their cybersecurity definitions and programs are closely aligned;
indeed, Richard Clarke and Robert Knake call Obama\'s plan \"CNCI
redux.\" 37 Both policies build on the recommendations and definitions
(in particular, of critical infrastructure) of President William J.
Clinton\'s Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection. 38
Regardless of political affiliation, American Presidents have taken an
expansive view of cybersecurity.

Proposed federal legislation is equally capacious in approach. The
National Cyber Infrastructure Protection Act of 2010 defines \"cyber
security activities\" as:

\[\*593\]

a class or collection of similar cyber security activities by a Federal
agency that involves personally identifiable data that is -

\(A\) screened by a cyber security system outside of the Federal agency
...

\(B\) transferred, for the purpose of cyber security, outside such
Federal Agency; or

\(C\) transferred, for the purpose of cyber security, to an element of
the intelligence community. 39

The Act conceives of cybersecurity not only broadly - it could include
the Federal Trade Commission\'s anti-spam efforts, for example - but
recursively. 40 The Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act of
2010 defines \"information security\" as \"protecting information and
information systems from disruption or unauthorized access, use,
disclosure, modification, or destruction in order to provide\"
integrity, confidentiality, and availability. 41 The Homeland Security
Cyber and Physical Infrastructure Protection Act of 2011 proposes
cybersecurity requirements that cover \"an occurrence that jeopardizes
the security of data or the physical security of a computer network
owned or operated by a Federal agency or covered critical
infrastructure,\" 42 where critical infrastructure includes private
sector computer systems identified by the Department of Homeland
Security. 43 In short, [for government policymakers, there is little
that cybersecurity does not cover.]{.underline}

[Similarly, legal scholars define the concept expansively]{.underline}.
Gus P. Coldebella and Brian M. White see cybersecurity as encompassing
\"criminality of all stripes, nation state and corporate espionage, and
attacks,\" even while they decry term-creep in the concept. 44 Sean M.
Condron, of the U.S. Army\'s Judge Advocate General\'s Legal Center and
School, 45 defines \[\*594\] the problem as attacks on critical
infrastructure by \"terrorists, nation-states, terrorist sympathizers,
and thrill seekers,\" 46 where critical infrastructure comprises
networked computer systems \"so vital to the United States that the
incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a
debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national
public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.\" 47 Susan
Brenner, in her Article classifying cybersecurity risks based on the
actor\'s intent, defines cyberthreats as those \"using computer
technology to engage in activity that undermines a society\'s ability to
maintain internal or external order.\" 48 Milton L. Mueller decries the
fact that \"the term security now encompasses a host of problems,
perhaps too many to fit properly under one word.\" 49 However, he then
proposes a governance-based approach to cybersecurity without offering a
coherent definition of the term, and includes spam, phishing, and
surveillance as representative threats. 50

[Even scholars who purportedly focus on narrower aspects of
cybersecurity **employ commodious definitions**]{.underline}. Kelly
Gable, who concentrates on cyberterrorism, defines it as \"efforts by
terrorists to use the Internet to hijack computer systems, bring down
the international finance system, or commit analogous terrorist actions
in cyberspace.\" 51 A 2001 report by Steven A. Hildreth of the
Congressional Research Service describes cyberwarfare as \"various
aspects of defending and attacking information and computer networks in
cyberspace, as well as denying an adversary\'s ability to do the same.\"
52 Brenner defines cybercrime as \"the use of computer technology to
commit crime; to engage in activity that threatens a society\'s ability
to maintain internal order.\" 53 [Richard Clarke, former Special Advisor
on Cybersecurity to President George W. Bush, and co-author Robert Knake
even conceive of cybersecurity as **encompassing** \[\*595\]
**intellectual property theft**. 54 These definitions of cybersecurity
are **vague, overbroad, and not helpful**.]{.underline} Each attempt at
framing the [cybersecurity problem implicitly sets a standard for
addressing the problem, for prioritizing it relative to competing
concerns, and for measuring progress. **Inaccurate cybersecurity
definitions impede** these efforts.]{.underline}

[Conceptual failures - shortcomings in theoretical orientation - are
largely to blame for what all commentators agree is an utter lack of
success in improving cybersecurity.]{.underline} 55 Legal scholarship
has thus far approached cybersecurity questions from within
well-established, comfortable, yet poorly fitting models from criminal
law, national security law, and military law. These doctrinal frameworks
push scholars to concentrate upon the identity of actors behind a
cyberthreat, and to determine their intent. 56 The problem is that the
Internet\'s design makes attribution extremely difficult. 57 Tracing an
attack to a given computer is challenging; deciphering who operated that
computer during the attack is harder yet; and discerning motive can be
nearly impossible. 58 The chief culprit, for most \[\*596\] scholars, is
the lack of an authentication mechanism in the Internet\'s core TCP/IP
protocols. 59 The Internet routes data in best-efforts fashion,
regardless of who sent it. 60 Indeed, there is simply no way to verify a
sender\'s identity under TCP/IP; functions such as authentication and
error-checking are left to higher-level network layers and applications.
61 This default setting, which permits unattributed communication, is
frequently exploited by malefactors - Internet traffic can be generated
by botnets of suborned computers available for rent, or from computers
specifically compromised for purposes of an attack. 62

Recent cybersecurity incidents illustrate the problem. The cyberassault
on Estonia during that country\'s conflict with Russia in May 2007
originated in part from computers located in Brazil and Vietnam. 63 The
July 2009 denial of service attack against South Korea and the U.S.,
widely attributed to North \[\*597\] Korea, 64 was launched from
computers in Austria, Georgia, Germany, and even South Korea and
America. 65 In both cases, initial judgments that a State (Russia or
North Korea) was responsible dissolved into uncertainty in the face of
mixed evidence. [Attribution is thus an intolerably hard problem for
conventional legal approaches.]{.underline} Worse, it is one that flows
directly from the architecture of the Internet. 66

Unsurprisingly, [the predominant answer to this perceived shortcoming is
to retrofit attribution capabilities into the core of the
Internet]{.underline}. Clarke and Knake want to move to new networks
where \"the user\'s authenticated identity could be embedded in each
packet.\" 67 Jeffrey A. Hunker too believes that the \"existing Internet
architecture is fundamentally insecure.\" 68 He seeks to replace the
Internet with a network that allows \"different governments to have
different rules,\" where governments \"protect their citizens on the
Internet the same way they protect them\" in other media. 69 Former
Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell argues \"we need to
reengineer the Internet to make attribution, geolocation, intelligence
analysis and impact assessment ... more manageable.\" 70 Former CIA
Director Michael V. Hayden proposes creating a new, \"hardened
enterprise structure\" for the Internet that \[\*598\] would embed
identification capabilities into its architecture. 71 Stuart Biegel
states that \"code-based adjustments in Internet architecture ... can go
a long way toward countering cyberterrorism.\" 72 Greater attribution
enables the traditional practice of deterrence, along with traditional
distinctions among criminals, terrorists, soldiers, and spies. 73 By
building strong attribution into networking protocols, lawyers (and
their governments) can apply time-tested ways of thinking and reacting
to threats online. However, trying to redesign the architecture of the
Internet as a solution has at least three critical shortcomings:
difficult implementation, unintended consequences, and loss of
generativity.

1 INTRODUCTION

[For many years [a popular definition of cybersecurity has been
the **CIA triad**]{.mark}: **Confidentiality, Integrity, and
Availability**. In this column I argue that [this definition]{.mark} can
[lead to a **narrow view** of cybersecurity]{.mark}. Instead, we should
focus more on the **activity and associated risks** for cybersecurity.
[It is]{.mark} now [time to **let go of this ancient definition** and
seek **better ways** to **define cybersecurity**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

2 THE CIA TRIAD

The CIA triad, Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability, has been
used as the practical definition of information security, and later
cybersecurity, since the beginning of the field of cybersecurity. The
tenet of the CIA triad is that cybersecurity of assets is defined by
three different aspects:

 Confidentiality: information is only available to the intended
consumers,

 Integrity: it is possible to prove that the information has not been
changed,

 Availability: information should be available to the intended
consumers.

The triad itself was introduced in the Anderson Report \[1\], which
discussed security exposure, and repeated in Saltzer and Schroeder
\[5\]. The CIA abbreviation was coined later by Steve Lipner around 1986
\[2\]. Since then, the term has been used widely in reports, standards,
and other publications on cybersecurity.

2.1 Focus on the CIA Triad Aspects

[[The focus on]{.mark} the aspects defined in [the **CIA triad is
problematic**]{.mark} for several different reasons. [The aspects are
**binary measures**]{.mark}; at a given time they are either **true or
false**.]{.underline} This sense of measurement gives a false sense of
accomplishment, as the current status gives no guarantees about the
future (or even the past).

[The binary nature of these aspects is **[counterintuitive to risk
assessment]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Each aspect is taken as an absolute
value that must be upheld, instead of performing a risk assessment that
may impact the security of an asset.

[The **triad** [leads to a **narrow focus** on]{.mark} the **security of
[individual assets]{.mark}**. **Confidentiality is a property of an
individual asset,**]{.underline} and usually not a property of a
context, such as a computer network or office environment. [This then
[leads to **individual measures**]{.mark} on objects [instead of a
**general approach**]{.mark} **to cybersecurity**.]{.underline}

The individual, binary measures and narrow focus in turn often [[lead to
**stop-gap solutions**]{.mark}. Once a **vulnerability** threatens to
break confidentiality, [a measure is put in place to **ensure
confidentiality**]{.mark} again. The **[actual risk]{.mark}** associated
with that **vulnerability is then usually [not taken into
account]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Due to the mitigation, confidentiality
is now guaranteed again, so the problem appears to be solved. This is
then often repeated many times for every new vulnerability.

Over the years, the CIA triad has been extended but has always retained
a focus on aspects of assets. One of the first extensions has been to
add "non-repudiation." A later extension is the Parkerian hexad \[4\],
with two other additional aspects, "possession" and "utility." The
fundamental problem of the focus on (binary) aspects of individual
objects remains, however.

2.2 The Context has Evolved, the Approach to Security Has Only Minimally
Adapted

In the advent of the cybersecurity field, risks associated with
cybersecurity were poorly understood. [[When the CIA triad was proposed,
computers were not connected to a]{.mark} (local) [network]{.mark}, and
the **Internet did not even exist**. Ware \[6\], Anderson, and Saltzer
and Schroeder have done great theoretical work regarding computer
security, since there were little to no practical attacks on
computers.]{.underline}

[[The **context** in which we use computers has **evolved
significantly**]{.mark}.]{.underline} From single, offline, room-filling
computers, we now have multiple computers in our pockets that are
constantly connected. Most processes in the physical world are now
affected in some way or another by computers. The nature of adversaries
have changed significantly.

### **[2AC\-\--C/I -- Defend systems & info -- AT: CIA triad]{.underline}**

#### Cybersecurity is a state whereby systems and information are defended against damage, unauthorized use, or exploitation \-\-- [Kosseff]{.underline} bases this definition on [legal documents and policy]{.underline}

States Naval Academy. B.A., M.P.P., University of Michigan; J.D.,

[Cybersecurity is a relatively new concept for courts.]{.underline}
Indeed, few U.S. courts have used the term, and [none have articulated a
common definition for cybersecurity]{.underline}. [The Department of
Homeland Security\'s National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and
Studies (NICCS) offers a fairly comprehensive definition of
cybersecurity: \"\[t\]he activity or process, ability or capability, or
state whereby information and communications systems and the information
contained therein are protected from and/or **defended against damage**,
unauthorized use or modification, or exploitation.]{.underline}\" [That
definition, which is based on various documents and policies issued by
**D**epartment of **H**omeland **S**ecurity, National Institutes of
Standards and Technology, and the White House, makes clear that
cybersecurity includes the **protection of both systems and
information**. This definition also correctly makes clear that
**cybersecurity is different from privacy**, which NICCS defines as the
\"assurance that the confidentiality of, and access to, certain
information about an entity is protected.\"]{.underline} Although
cybersecurity can help to protect individuals\' privacy, [the terms are
not interchangeable]{.underline}. [Privacy involves assuring individuals
that their personal data is protected, while cybersecurity more broadly
encompasses the steps that a company takes to protect its systems and
the information that is stored on those systems.]{.underline} If a
company does not enact the necessary cybersecurity safeguards, then its
consumers\' and employees\' privacy may be more likely to be at risk.
Accordingly, companies are increasingly focusing on cybersecurity.

Information Security in the network context deals with data integrity,
confidentiality, availability and non-repudiation while is sent across

on networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions by
passing messages. [In this context cybersecurity deals with all the

[Conceptualizing cybersecurity challenges policymakers and
academics]{.underline}. 32 [The current theoretical approaches to
cybersecurity]{.underline}, though, [have proved to be significantly
flawed]{.underline}. They employ [definitions that are vague and
overbroad]{.underline}; [they seek to force cybersecurity\'s issues into
the **straitjackets** of existing doctrines **poorly suited to
cybersecurity\'s problems**; and they produce concomitant policy
recommendations that not only fail to mitigate, but actually **worsen,
the Internet\'s security challenges**]{.underline}.

[Conventional wisdom on cybersecurity identifies the problem as
all-encompassing]{.underline}. 33 [Scholars, government officials, and
journalists tend to view cybersecurity as the \"protection of all things
Internet\"]{.underline} 34 - an approach that impedes practical progress
by failing to set priorities. [Government efforts at capturing
cybersecurity\'s scope have been particularly overbroad]{.underline}.
\[\*592\] President Barack H. Obama\'s Cyberspace Policy Review offers a
representative definition, where cybersecurity is:

strategy, policy, and standards regarding the security of and operations
in cyberspace, and encompasses the full range of threat reduction,
vulnerability reduction, deterrence, international engagement, incident
response, resiliency, and recovery policies and activities, including
computer network operations, information assurance, law enforcement,
diplomacy, military, and intelligence missions as they relate to the
security and stability of the global information and communications
infrastructure. 35

Presidential policies have been strikingly consistent. President Barack
Obama\'s approach to cybersecurity is almost identical to the
Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI), the strategy
employed by Obama\'s Republican predecessor, President George W. Bush.
36 Their cybersecurity definitions and programs are closely aligned;
indeed, Richard Clarke and Robert Knake call Obama\'s plan \"CNCI
redux.\" 37 Both policies build on the recommendations and definitions
(in particular, of critical infrastructure) of President William J.
Clinton\'s Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection. 38
Regardless of political affiliation, American Presidents have taken an
expansive view of cybersecurity.

Proposed federal legislation is equally capacious in approach. The
National Cyber Infrastructure Protection Act of 2010 defines \"cyber
security activities\" as:

\[\*593\]

a class or collection of similar cyber security activities by a Federal
agency that involves personally identifiable data that is -

\(A\) screened by a cyber security system outside of the Federal agency
...

\(B\) transferred, for the purpose of cyber security, outside such
Federal Agency; or

\(C\) transferred, for the purpose of cyber security, to an element of
the intelligence community. 39

The Act conceives of cybersecurity not only broadly - it could include
the Federal Trade Commission\'s anti-spam efforts, for example - but
recursively. 40 [The Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act of
2010 defines \"information security\" as \"protecting information and
information systems from disruption or unauthorized access, use,
disclosure, modification, or destruction in order to provide\"
**integrity, confidentiality, and availability**]{.underline}. 41 The
Homeland Security Cyber and Physical Infrastructure Protection Act of
2011 proposes cybersecurity requirements that cover \"an occurrence that
jeopardizes the security of data or the physical security of a computer
network owned or operated by a Federal agency or covered critical
infrastructure,\" 42 where critical infrastructure includes private
sector computer systems identified by the Department of Homeland
Security. 43 In short, [for government policymakers, there is little
that cybersecurity does not cover.]{.underline}

[Similarly, legal scholars define the concept expansively]{.underline}.
Gus P. Coldebella and Brian M. White see cybersecurity as encompassing
\"criminality of all stripes, nation state and corporate espionage, and
attacks,\" even while they decry term-creep in the concept. 44 Sean M.
Condron, of the U.S. Army\'s Judge Advocate General\'s Legal Center and
School, 45 defines \[\*594\] the problem as attacks on critical
infrastructure by \"terrorists, nation-states, terrorist sympathizers,
and thrill seekers,\" 46 where critical infrastructure comprises
networked computer systems \"so vital to the United States that the
incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a
debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national
public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.\" 47 Susan
Brenner, in her Article classifying cybersecurity risks based on the
actor\'s intent, defines cyberthreats as those \"using computer
technology to engage in activity that undermines a society\'s ability to
maintain internal or external order.\" 48 Milton L. Mueller decries the
fact that \"the term security now encompasses a host of problems,
perhaps too many to fit properly under one word.\" 49 However, he then
proposes a governance-based approach to cybersecurity without offering a
coherent definition of the term, and includes spam, phishing, and
surveillance as representative threats. 50

[Even scholars who purportedly focus on narrower aspects of
cybersecurity **employ commodious definitions**]{.underline}. Kelly
Gable, who concentrates on cyberterrorism, defines it as \"efforts by
terrorists to use the Internet to hijack computer systems, bring down
the international finance system, or commit analogous terrorist actions
in cyberspace.\" 51 A 2001 report by Steven A. Hildreth of the
Congressional Research Service describes cyberwarfare as \"various
aspects of defending and attacking information and computer networks in
cyberspace, as well as denying an adversary\'s ability to do the same.\"
52 Brenner defines cybercrime as \"the use of computer technology to
commit crime; to engage in activity that threatens a society\'s ability
to maintain internal order.\" 53 Richard Clarke, former Special Advisor
on Cybersecurity to President George W. Bush, and co-author Robert Knake
even conceive of cybersecurity as encompassing \[\*595\] intellectual
property theft[. 54 These definitions of cybersecurity are **vague,
overbroad, and not helpful**.]{.underline} Each attempt at framing the
[cybersecurity problem implicitly sets a standard for addressing the
problem, for prioritizing it relative to competing concerns, and for
measuring progress. **Inaccurate cybersecurity definitions impede**
these efforts.]{.underline}

[Conceptual failures - shortcomings in theoretical orientation - are
largely to blame for what all commentators agree is an utter lack of
success in improving cybersecurity.]{.underline} 55 Legal scholarship
has thus far approached cybersecurity questions from within
well-established, comfortable, yet poorly fitting models from criminal
law, national security law, and military law. These doctrinal frameworks
push scholars to concentrate upon the identity of actors behind a
cyberthreat, and to determine their intent. 56 The problem is that the
Internet\'s design makes attribution extremely difficult. 57 Tracing an
attack to a given computer is challenging; deciphering who operated that
computer during the attack is harder yet; and discerning motive can be
nearly impossible. 58 The chief culprit, for most \[\*596\] scholars, is
the lack of an authentication mechanism in the Internet\'s core TCP/IP
protocols. 59 The Internet routes data in best-efforts fashion,
regardless of who sent it. 60 Indeed, there is simply no way to verify a
sender\'s identity under TCP/IP; functions such as authentication and
error-checking are left to higher-level network layers and applications.
61 This default setting, which permits unattributed communication, is
frequently exploited by malefactors - Internet traffic can be generated
by botnets of suborned computers available for rent, or from computers
specifically compromised for purposes of an attack. 62

Recent cybersecurity incidents illustrate the problem. The cyberassault
on Estonia during that country\'s conflict with Russia in May 2007
originated in part from computers located in Brazil and Vietnam. 63 The
July 2009 denial of service attack against South Korea and the U.S.,
widely attributed to North \[\*597\] Korea, 64 was launched from
computers in Austria, Georgia, Germany, and even South Korea and
America. 65 In both cases, initial judgments that a State (Russia or
North Korea) was responsible dissolved into uncertainty in the face of
mixed evidence. [Attribution is thus an intolerably hard problem for
conventional legal approaches.]{.underline} Worse, it is one that flows
directly from the architecture of the Internet. 66

Unsurprisingly, [the predominant answer to this perceived shortcoming is
to retrofit attribution capabilities into the core of the
Internet]{.underline}. Clarke and Knake want to move to new networks
where \"the user\'s authenticated identity could be embedded in each
packet.\" 67 Jeffrey A. Hunker too believes that the \"existing Internet
architecture is fundamentally insecure.\" 68 He seeks to replace the
Internet with a network that allows \"different governments to have
different rules,\" where governments \"protect their citizens on the
Internet the same way they protect them\" in other media. 69 Former
Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell argues \"we need to
reengineer the Internet to make attribution, geolocation, intelligence
analysis and impact assessment ... more manageable.\" 70 Former CIA

enterprise structure\" for the Internet that \[\*598\] would embed
identification capabilities into its architecture. 71 Stuart Biegel
states that \"code-based adjustments in Internet architecture ... can go
a long way toward countering cyberterrorism.\" 72 Greater attribution
enables the traditional practice of deterrence, along with traditional
distinctions among criminals, terrorists, soldiers, and spies. 73 By
building strong attribution into networking protocols, lawyers (and
their governments) can apply time-tested ways of thinking and reacting
to threats online. However, trying to redesign the architecture of the
Internet as a solution has at least three critical shortcomings:
difficult implementation, unintended consequences, and loss of
generativity.

#### Cybersecurity only requires [one tenet]{.underline} of the CIA triad

and European Law at Freie Universität Berlin, holder of an Ad Personam
Jean-Monnet-Chair, and previous Legal Adviser to the European Political
Strategy Center (EPSC), advising and working under the authority of its
President Jean-Claude Juncker & PhD candidate and scientific assistant

Law Journal, Vol. 21, p. 1149 /lg

[Alongside space, air, land, and sea, cyber is the fifth
dimension]{.underline}. It opens a global virtual world, radically
changing societies and shaking classical borders. But [a]{.underline}
digital world also comes with new types of micro threats on businesses
and citizens, and macro threats on public policies and state security,
which are asymmetrical, unpredictable, and unaffected by classical state
responses. They occur at \[\*1150\] the level of tricksters and range up
to state espionage and, potentially, offensive cyber-attacks against
states. Cyber is as such a new global world, where there is no dividing
line between external and internal security. There is an attacker in one
country, aiming for a target in another, causing damage in yet a third.
There are as well large-scale attacks targeting and affecting several
Member States at once\--with the actual attack being carried out in
cyberspace, which does not even adhere to one spot, country, or
continent, but is a dimension for itself. This raises the question of
the adequacy, or inadequacy, of the classical regulatory tools to reply
to these challenges.

[In this new environment, the EU and its Member States need to
anticipate and plan for hitherto unimaginable scenarios in which they
would be put if under a severe cyber-attack]{.underline}. This is
particularly true for the implementation of the European Commission\'s
EU Digital Single Market agenda. With the financial industry at its very
center, a digital single market for the free movement of persons,
services, and capital is highly dependent on a reliable and robust IT
infrastructure. Comparable to the field of \"industry 4.0,\" innovation
in the financial sector\--for example, the idea of a \"Digital City,\" a
financial platform of Europe that coordinates a network of financial
centers in the EU \--and the success of new business models depend on
trust in a safe digital environment.

[Cybersecurity is a term that covers a wide range of
activities]{.underline}. Broadly speaking, it can be divided into three
different categories: Network and information security, fight against
cybercrime, and cyber defense. With regard to network and information
security, [cybersecurity can be defined as the ability of network and
information systems to resist action that compromises the
**availability, authenticity, integrity, or confidentiality** of digital
data or the services those systems provide]{.underline}. This Article
will focus on cybersecurity in the financial sector in its dimension of
network and information security. Still, it will also refer to the other
two areas of cybersecurity where necessary and appropriate. The
financial sector is understood as the entirety of payment systems,
credit institutions, payment institutions, stock exchanges, trade
repositories, central securities depositories, central counterparty
clearing houses, securities settlement platforms, credit rating
agencies, insurance companies, and asset management companies.

#### [Only one]{.underline} part of the CIA triad is necessary to constitute a cyberattack \-\-- and, it's not a triad at all \-\-- the fourth category is [authentication]{.underline}

[Defining Cybersecurity]{.underline}

Chris Jaikaran, Analyst in Cybersecurity Policy (cjaikaran@crs.loc.gov,
7-0750) [The United States government does not have a single definition
describing cybersecurity.]{.underline} However, the Commission on
Enhancing National Cybersecurity's "Report on Securing and Growing the
Digital Economy" offers the following:

The process of protecting information and information systems by
preventing, detecting, and responding to unauthorized access, use,
disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide
confidentiality, integrity, and availability.277

The concepts of "confidentiality," "integrity," and "availability" are
defined in U.S. Code as part of the "information security" triad.
"Confidentiality" means that data is known only to authorized parties,
"integrity" means that data is known to those parties in the manner they
intend and not altered by another, and "availability" means that the
data is available for access by those parties when they choose. These
terms apply to the data stored, processed and transmitted by information
technology (IT) systems, but also to the IT systems themselves. [Growing
in importance is a **fourth term** for information
security---"**authentication**"---or the ability to confirm that parties
using a system and accessing data are who they claim to be and have
legitimate access to that data and system.]{.underline}

With the information security framework, **[cyberattacks can be
categorized by what the attack compromises.]{.underline}** For example[,
a data breach compromises confidentiality of information, malware that
instructs a system to take an action the user did not authorize
compromises integrity, and a denial of service attack compromises the
availability of information.]{.underline}

[[In]{.mark} the ﬁeld of [cyber security, ill-deﬁned concepts and
**inconsistent**]{.mark}ly applied [terminology are]{.mark} further
[complicating **a**]{.mark}n already [complex issue]{.mark}. This
[causes difﬁculties for **policy-makers**]{.mark}, **strategists** and
**academics**.]{.underline} Using national cyber security strategies to
support current literature, this paper undertakes three tasks with the
goal of classifying and deﬁning terms to begin the development of a
lexicon of cyber security terminology. The ﬁrst task is to offer for
consideration a deﬁnition of "active cyber defence" (ACD). This
deﬁnition is based upon a number of characteristics identiﬁed in current
academic and policy literature. ACD is deﬁned here as the proactive
detection, analysis and mitigation of network security breaches in
real-time combined with the use of aggressive countermeasures deployed
outside the victim network. Once deﬁned, ACD is contextualised alongside
two further approaches to cyber defence and security. These are fortiﬁed
and resilient cyber defence, predicated upon defensive perimeters and
ensuring continuity of services respectively. This contextualisation is
postulated in order to provide more clarity to non-active cyber defence
measures than is offered by the commonly used term "passive cyber
defence". Finally, it is shown that these three approaches to cyber
defence and security are neither mutually exclusive nor applied
independently of one another. Rather they operate in a complementary
triptych of policy approaches to achieving cyber security.

## 1NC\-\--Info Warfare Not Cybersecurity

#### The DOD defines "cybersecurity" and "information warfare" as distinct activities

Operations, Cyberwarfare, and Cybersecurity: Capabilities and Related
Policy Issues," Congressional Research Service (CRS)

IO = Information Operations

IW = Information warfare

Cyberspace presents a force multiplier for IW activities. Social media
and botnets can amplify a message or narrative, using all three elements
of information to foment discord and confusion in a target audience.19
Much [of today's IW is conducted in cyberspace, **leading many to
associate IO with cybersecurity**. Within **DOD, however**]{.underline},
[IO and cyberspace operations **are distinct** doctrinal
activities.]{.underline} Cyberspace operations can be used to achieve
strategic information warfare goals; an offensive cyberattack, for
example, may be used to create psychological effects in a target
population. A foreign country may use cyberattacks to influence
decisionmaking and change behaviors, for example the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK)-attributed cyberattacks on Sony in late 2014.
[Cyber operations may be conducted]{.underline} for other purposes, such
as [to disable or deny access to an adversary's lines of communication,
or]{.underline} to [degrade]{.underline} components of
[c]{.underline}ritical [i]{.underline}nfrastructure that may be used for
nefarious purposes.20

[IO may be overt]{.underline}, such as a government's production and
dissemination of materials intended to convey democratic values. In this
case, the government sponsorship of such activity is known. Covert
operations are those in which government sponsorship is denied if
exposed. The anonymity afforded by cyberspace can present an ideal
battle space to conduct covert information operations. In addition, [IO
may take place outside of cyberspace.]{.underline}

Although [several official documents]{.underline} now [refer to
"information warfare"]{.underline} in other countries, [the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has no formal government
definition of IW]{.underline}. [The DOD definition of information
operations refers only to military operations]{.underline} and [does not
emphasize the use of cyberspace to achieve nonmilitary strategic
objectives]{.underline}. Similarly, there is no commonly accepted
definition of "cyberwarfare"; rather, the military refers to offensive
and defensive cyberspace operations, with cyberspace as a warfighting
domain or operating environment.

[Cyberspace o]{.underline}peration[s differ]{.underline} from
[info]{.underline}rmation [op]{.underline}eration[s]{.underline}, [which
are specifically concerned]{.underline} [with the use of
info]{.underline}rmation-related [capabilitie]{.underline}s, such as
military information support operations or military deception.
Cyber-enabled information operations can be characterized as IO
conducted in cyberspace. Just as [IO carries its own doctrine and
associated organizational structures, so do cyberspace
operations]{.underline}, which are generally considered the purview of
the United States Cyber Command.

IW = Information Warfare

Information warfare is hardly a new endeavor. In the Battle of
Thermopylae in 480 BC, Persian ruler Xerxes used intimidation tactics to
break the will of Greek city-states. Alexander the Great used cultural
assimilation to subdue dissent and maintain conquered lands. Military
scholars trace the modern use of information as a tool in guerilla
warfare to fifth-century BC Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu's book
The Art of War and its emphasis on accurate intelligence for decision
superiority over a mightier foe. These ancient strategists helped to lay
the foundation for information warfare strategy in modern times. Taking
place below the level of armed conflict, information warfare
([IW]{.underline}) i[s the range of military and government operations
to protect and exploit the information environment]{.underline}.
Although information is recognized as an element of national power, [IW
is a relatively **poorly understood** concept]{.underline} in the United
States, with [several other terms being used to describe the same or
similar sets of activity]{.underline}. [IW is a strategy for using
information to pursue a competitive advantage, including offensive and
defensive efforts.]{.underline} [A form of **political
warfare**]{.underline}, IW is a means through which nations achieve
strategic objectives and advance foreign policy goals. Defensive efforts
include information assurance/information security, while offensive
efforts include information operations. [Similar terms sometimes used to
characterize information warfare include active]{.underline}

[measures, hybrid warfare, and gray zone warfare.]{.underline}

IW is sometimes referred to as a "disinformation campaign," yet
disinformation is only one of the tactics used in information operations
(IO). The types of information used in IO include propaganda,
misinformation, and disinformation.

As [cyberspace presents an easy, cost-effective method to communicate a
message]{.underline} to large swaths of populations, much of present day
information warfare takes place on the internet, leading
[some]{.underline} to **[conflate "cyberwarfare" with information
warfare]{.underline}**. While [IO]{.underline} in the United States
[tends to be seen as a **purely military activity**]{.underline}, other
countries and terrorist organizations have robust information warfare
strategies and use a whole-of-government or whole-of-society approach to
information operations.

### [Cybersecurity -- Excludes Info Sharing]{.underline}

#### Information sharing often weakens cybersecurity

Eli **Dourado &** Andrea **O'Sullivan 15**, Senior Research Fellow at
the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and advisor to the State
Department on international telecommunication matters who has served on
several U.S. delegations to UN treaty and policy conferences & feature
writer at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, "'Information
Sharing': No Panacea for American Cybersecurity Challenges", 06/22/2015,
Mercatus Center at George Mason University,
<https://www.mercatus.org/publications/technology-and-innovation/%E2%80%9Cinformation-sharing%E2%80%9D-no-panacea-american-cybersecurity>
/lg

Information sharing initiatives are not novel. A 1998 presidential order
authorized the formation of public-private partnerships to share threat
information within critical infrastructure industries. Dozens of such
Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) have coordinated
cyberthreat information flows among public and private entities since
that time. Additionally, at least 20 federal offices already carry out
missions that prioritize information sharing and public-private
cybersecurity coordination. The National Cybersecurity and
Communications Center (NCCIC), a DHS cyberthreat coordination center,
houses the US Computer Emergency Response Team (US-CERT), which has
served as the primary cyberthreat collection, assistance, and
notification center since it was founded in 2003. President Obama
created the CTIIC in February 2015 to advance information sharing goals
along with the NCCIC, the Federal Bureau of Intelligence's National
Cyber Investigative Task Force, DOD's US Cyber Command, and "other
relevant United States Government entities"---which could amount to
several dozen offices. Such overlapping roles and unclear lines of
communication results in waste, inefficiency, and poorer security
outcomes.

Despite the ample resources devoted to this task, the federal government
has struggled to effectively collect and share incident information
internally and with the private sector. ISACs can cease to operate if
members do not actually share valuable information. A DHS Inspector
General Report finds that the NCCIC faces large challenges in
effectively sharing information among the appropriate parties. As of
October 2014, the NCCIC had not even developed a common incident
management system to coordinate information sharing---five years after
being formed to do so. US-CERT has yet to develop performance metrics to
gauge and improve effectiveness, despite serving as the main federal
cybersecurity consultant for over a decade. Additionally, private sector
threat analysis efforts often outpace US-CERT in breach notification.
Indeed, DHS has at times been unable to even adequately share threat
information within its own offices. In March 2013, DHS's own US-CERT
issued a warning about Windows XP vulnerabilities to government and
private sector partners. But by November of that year, DHS' Inspector
General reported that several DHS computers were still running a
vulnerable version of Windows XP, even after other DHS representatives
ensured they had stopped running that version.

[The Congressional Research Service notes "greater information sharing
may, in some instances, effectively **weaken cybersecurity** by creating
an overwhelming amount of information, eliminating the capacity to pay
attention to truly important alerts]{.underline}." The federal
government sought to overcome this challenge by developing technological
tools to surveil network activity, called the "EINSTEIN" projects, yet
these projects often run over cost and perform worse than anticipated.
Indeed, the EINSTEIN projects failed to identify the recent OPM hack.
However ambitious their design, these programs have so far proven too
technologically crude to handle the complex central identification and
communication efforts intended to protect federal systems. There may
never be enough EINSTEINs in the world for DHS, DOD, and DOJ to
adequately coordinate and respond to the massive amounts of private data
that would be collected under CISA.

#### Cybersecurity solely refers to technical features

Rand **Waltzman 17**, Senior Information Scientist for the RAND
Corporation, Testimony from Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on
Cybersecurity Hearing; \"Cyber-Enabled Information Operations.\";
Congressional Documents and Publications //chico

The General Threat

Traditionally, \"[information operations and warfare]{.underline}, also
known as influence operations, includes the collection of tactical
information about an adversary as well as the dissemination of
propaganda in pursuit of a competitive advantage over an opponent.\" n4
This definition is applicable in military as well as civilian contexts.
Traditional techniques (e.g. print media, radio, movies, and television)
[have been extended to the **cyber domain**]{.underline} through the
creation of the Internet and social media.

These technologies have resulted in a qualitatively new landscape of
influence operations, persuasion, and, more generally, mass
manipulation. The ability to influence is now effectively
\"democratized,\" since any individual or group can communicate and
influence large numbers of others online. Second, this landscape is now
significantly more quantifiable. Data can be used to measure the
response of individuals as well as crowds to influence efforts. Finally,
influence is also far more concealable. Users may be influenced by
information provided to them by anonymous strangers, or even by the
design of an interface. In general, the Internet and social media
provide new ways of constructing realities for actors, audiences, and
media. It fundamentally challenges the traditional news media\'s
function as gatekeepers and agenda-setters. n5

Interaction within the information environment is rapidly evolving, and
old models are becoming irrelevant faster than we can develop new ones.
The result is uncertainty that leaves us exposed to dangerous influences
without proper defenses.

The [information environment can be broadly characterized along **both
technical and psychosocial dimensions**]{.underline}. [Information
environment security today]{.underline} (often [referred to as
**cybersecurity)**]{.underline} [is primarily concerned with **purely
technical features**]{.underline}\--[defenses against denial-of-service
attacks, botnets, massive Intellectual Property thefts, and other
attacks that typically take advantage of security
vulnerabilities.]{.underline} This view is too narrow, however. For
example, little attention has been paid to defending against incidents
like the April 2013 Associated Press Twitter n6 hack in which a group
hijacked the news agency\'s account to put out a message reading \"Two
explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured.\" This
message, with the weight of the Associated Press behind it, caused a
drop and recovery of roughly \$136 billion in equity market value over a
period of about five minutes. This attack exploited both technical
(hijacking the account) and psychosocial (understanding market reaction)
features of the information environment.

E. The Cyberthreat in Internet Governance

On February 2, 2012, FBI Director Robert Mueller told a U.S. House
Committee, \"the cyberthreat will equal or surpass the threat from
counter terrorism in the foreseeable future.\" 120 The elements
comprising the cyberthreat are complex. No system is secure in an
absolute sense. It is possible to covertly raid and damage even the most
protected computer networks for those with the will, resources, and
patience to commit such acts - [cybersecurity is a
**continuum**]{.underline} in which all users are at some degree of
risk. [Technical vulnerabilities]{.underline}, though, [are only **part
of the story** of the cyberthreat.]{.underline} [Other confounding
variables include the fact that the applicable international law is
often ambiguous or non-bindin]{.underline}g, while regulators must keep
pace with advancing technology that is continually changing the threat
matrix. 121 Developments in cybersecurity and data monitoring are also
allowing for increased national regulation and censorship of the
Internet. 122 This trend toward Internet sovereignty discussed in Part
II is pitted against a history of a more hands-off approach to Internet
governance and complicates efforts to address cybersecurity challenges.
123 To meet the diverse elements of the cyberthreat, some commentators
have moved from a one-size-fits-all approach to a tiered model, parsing
out cyberattacks based on the attacker\'s motive and means into the
categories of cyberwar, cybercrime, cyberespionage, and cyberterrorism.
124 These categories help define policy and legal responses to
cyber-related incidents, but problems of overlap, attribution, and other
challenges curtail their utility. 125 The following subsections briefly
unpack the cyberthreat and underscore the extent to which these
collective action problems thwart attempts at management.

1\. Cyberwar

Definitions vary, but cyberwarfare generally refers to an attack by one
hostile nation against the computers or networks of another in order to
cause disruption or damage, as compared to a criminal or terrorist
attack, which involves a private actor. 126 Such attacks are known as
\"informationalized warfare\" in China. 127 [From a U.S. military
perspective, cyberwar falls under \"information
operations,\"]{.underline} 128 which includes computer network defense
and exploitation involving the offensive and defensive use of IT to
protect critical national infrastructure and eliminate cyberthreats to
Department of Defense (DoD) computers or networks. 129 [The specific
doctrine of cyberwar is a classified and **evolving topic in** U.S.
defense circles]{.underline}, but the prevailing military doctrine calls
for \"U.S. dominance\" across all \"domains of warfare,\" including
cyberspace. 130 This entails the U.S. military [having \"freedom of
access to and use of\" cyberspace while **denying that freedom** to
adversaries]{.underline}. 131 Both the UK Ministry of Defense and the
U.S. Joint Forces Command are working to preserve access to cyberspace.
132 Still, a genuine cyberwar has yet to take place, even though
cyberweapons are being developed worldwide without transparent
discussions about the circumstances in which they may be used. Thus,
\"cyberwarfare\" has become a catchall term that does not explain
cyberattacks in general. Similarly, the term \"cyberattack,\" used
throughout this Article, is commonly invoked by the media, but should
not be confused with an \"armed attack,\" which activates the law of
armed conflict. 133 Indeed, a traditional war framework is inappropriate
for managing most cyber-related incidents. This makes defining the line
between cyberwar, cyberespionage, cybercrime, and cyberterrorism all the
more important.

---U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security -- CyberSecurity overview,
"Cybersecurity"

Cyberspace and its underlying infrastructure are vulnerable to a wide
range of risk stemming from both physical and cyber threats and hazards.
Sophisticated cyber actors and nation-states exploit vulnerabilities to
steal information and money and are developing capabilities to disrupt,
destroy, or threaten the delivery of essential services. A range of
traditional crimes are now being perpetrated through cyberspace. This
includes the production and distribution of child pornography and child
exploitation conspiracies, banking and financial fraud, intellectual
property violations, and other crimes, all of which have substantial
human and economic consequences.

Cyberspace is particularly difficult to secure due to a number of
factors: the ability of malicious actors to operate from anywhere in the
world, the linkages between cyberspace and physical systems, and the
difficulty of reducing vulnerabilities and consequences in complex cyber
networks. Of growing concern is the cyber threat to critical
infrastructure, which is increasingly subject to sophisticated cyber
intrusions that pose new risks. As information technology becomes
increasingly integrated with physical infrastructure operations, there
is increased risk for wide scale or high-consequence events that could
cause harm or disrupt services upon which our economy and the daily
lives of millions of Americans depend. In light of the risk and
potential consequences of cyber events, strengthening the security and
resilience of cyberspace has become an important homeland security
mission.

**o**peration**s** [**undercuts** the **legitimacy** of]{.mark} **NATO
op**eration**s** by failing to build public understanding, and leaves
NATO open to charges of sinister plots, since denial of offensive
capabilities is not credible when two NATO members are world leaders in
cyber operations.]{.underline}

Parallels between cyber operations and nuclear strategy are usually
misleading, but cannot always be dismissed. The parallel for NATO is
that [cyber attack is a "weapon"]{.underline} with both strategic and
tactical uses, [which only a few NATO members possess]{.underline}.
Unlike nuclear weapons, however, [the procedures for integrating
**o**ffensive **c**yber **o**peration**s** into **NATO's defensive
actions** are **not** at all **obvious**, if they exist. [NATO will
**need to describe** how the **cyber capabilities**]{.mark} possessed
by]{.underline} a few of [its members will **[support NATO's defensive
activities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [NATO's credibility in defence
**[requires some public discussion]{.mark}** on the use of **o**ffensive
**c**yber **o**peration**s**.]{.underline}

There has been a confusing debate over the merits of cyber deterrence,
but one conclusion that we can draw from this discussion is that both
[the contribution of **cyber op**eration**s** to deterrence and the
ability to deter cyber attack work **best** when **embedded** in a
larger military force structure. Adding offensive cyber capabilities to
NATO's force structure and response doctrine will increase its deterrent
capabilities]{.underline} -- by how much is unclear, but what is clear
is that [a failure to add cyber capabilities will erode a credible
deterrent as cyber operations are increasingly embedded into military
operations]{.underline}.5

Beyond deterrence, two other factors point to the need for additional
consideration of NATO's public posture on offensive cyber operations.
The first is that [**cyber** technique**s** are **essential** for the
kinds of combat operations that NATO forces may carry out in the future.
No modern **air force** would enter into combat without electronic
warfare (EW) capabilities]{.underline}; as cyber and EW merge into a
single activity, [air operations will require cyber support. The same is
true for **special** forces **op**eration**s**. **Of**fensive **c**yber
capabilities will shape the battlefields of the future.]{.underline}

Second, [NATO's potential opponents will use cyber techniques in new
ways, in what some have called "hybrid warfare".]{.underline}6 [These
include]{.underline} countries traditionally of concern to NATO, but
[cyber threats could also come from new actors, such as **Iran** or
**North Korea**, and proxy or non-state actors such as the **Syrian
Electronic Army**.]{.underline} These nations and groups, using cyber
techniques, now have new ways to strike NATO countries.

[Military doctrine is changing as opponents seek to circumvent US
military power and use a blend of political action and "influence
operations", special forces, proxies and irregular units, unconventional
tactics and cyber techniques to apply force to gain their
ends.]{.underline} Cyber techniques for political action and "influence
operations" are not intended to destroy or disrupt, but [rather to put
coercive political pressure on targets. This new style of warfare will
**challenge planning for mutual defence**.]{.underline} For these
reasons, the need for more than defensive or technical cyber
capabilities will increase.7

#### OCO's are for disrupting [OTHER]{.underline} countries' networks, [NOT]{.underline} strengthening our own -- here's [definitive]{.underline} evidence

For the purposes of this policy brief, [we use a]{.underline} draft
**[definition]{.underline}** that's being developed as part of the
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet's Cyber Lexicon project[.
It **[define]{.mark}s**]{.underline} [**[o]{.mark}**ffensive
**[c]{.mark}**yber **[o]{.mark}**perations]{.underline} as
['[activities]{.mark} in cyberspace [that manipulate]{.mark}, deny,
[disrupt]{.mark}, degrade [or destroy **targeted** computers,
info]{.mark}rmation [systems, or networks]{.mark}'.]{.underline}7
[[Given]{.mark} [the]{.mark} range of [countries]{.mark} with varying
capabilities]{.underline} and using examples from open sources,
[[o]{.mark}ffensive [c]{.mark}yber [o]{.mark}perations [could]{.mark}
range from the **subtle to the destructive**]{.underline}:
[[remov]{.mark}ing [computer accounts]{.mark}]{.underline} or changing
passwords; [[alter]{.mark}ing [database]{.mark}s]{.underline} either
subtly or destructively; defacing web pages[; encrypting or deleting
data]{.underline}; [[or even **attack**]{.mark}**s**]{.underline} that
affect [critical infrastructure,]{.underline} such as electricity
networks. Even though it may use the same tools and techniques, cyber
espionage, by contrast, is explicitly designed to gather intelligence
without having an effect---ideally without detection. The Global
Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace has commissioned ASPI's
International Cyber Policy Centre to do further work on defining
offensive cyber capabilities.

#### Even offensive cyber [capabilities]{.underline} are about manipulating adversarial networks -- [NOT]{.underline} strengthening [our own]{.underline}

**Egloff '21** \[Florian J.; 10/26/21; DPhil in Cyber Security from the
University of Oxford and Masters in International Relations from Geneva
Graduate Institute; and James Shires,

[[Offensive cyber **capabilities**]{.underline}]{.mark} (OCCs) are the
combination of people, technologies, and organizational attributes that
jointly [[enable]{.mark} **[o]{.mark}**ffensive **[c]{.mark}**yber
**o**peration**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [**[the adversarial
manipulation]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [digital services
or [networks]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Most works on OCCs focus on
their (de-)escalatory potential in terms of diplomatic tension,
instability, or power. This article argues for a re-orientation toward
the normatively prior question of their relative violence. It asks: how
are OCCs integrated into violent state capacities and what are the
consequences? The article proposes three logics of integration by which
[[OCCs are]{.mark} included [in violent state actions]{.mark}, in both
repressive and interstate situations.]{.underline} These
logics---substitution, support, and complement---weigh the benefits of
using [[OCCs **against an adversary**]{.underline}]{.mark} instead of,
as part of, and in addition to other means of violence, respectively.
The article argues that the violence of OCCs depends on two things:
first, whether one adopts a narrowly physical or a more expansive
definition of violence and, second, which logic of integration governs
their use. On a narrow definition of violence, substitutive and
supportive uses of OCCs are less likely to be violent than conventional
alternatives, and complementary uses of OCCs are not violent at all. On
a wider definition, [both substitutive and supportive uses of OCCs can
lead to more violence than conventional alternatives]{.underline}, while
complementary uses of OCCs are highly likely to increase violence
overall. Acknowledging the different logics of integration for OCCs, and
understanding their violent effects, has important analytical and policy
benefits for global security studies.

#### Interp: NATO Maritime Security is limited to conventional military operations and cyberspace

**N**orth **A**tlantic **T**reaty **O**rganization**, 22** (7/14/22;
"NATO's maritime activities" NATO
<https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_70759.htm>; Accessed 7/16/22)
//LVL

[The 2011 Alliance [Maritime]{.mark} Strategy derives four maritime
roles for the Alliance to contribute to: deterrence and collective
defence, crisis management, [cooperative security]{.mark} and maritime
security.]{.underline} Since 2014, the Alliance's adaptation to the
changed security environment has been pursued along two essential
tracks: strengthening the Alliance's deterrence and defence posture and
enhancing NATO's contribution to projecting stability. Reinforcement of
the Alliance Maritime Posture is an integral and cross-cutting part of
the implementation of these two tracks and was reconfirmed in the 2022
Strategic Concept. The Alliance Maritime Strategy describes NATO's four
strategic roles or what it does in the maritime domain. The Alliance
Maritime Posture describes NATO's functions or how it uses the maritime
domain and the Alliance's naval forces. NATO is strengthening its
deterrence and defence posture in all domains. The maritime domain
encompasses oceans and seas, on, above and below the surface, in all
directions. It is a continuum and it is fully connected to other domains
and areas. The Alliance's naval forces include those maritime forces,
sensors and other capabilities under national or NATO command that
contribute to Alliance security. [The Alliance Maritime Posture
[comprises the Alliance's naval forces]{.mark}]{.underline}, their
presence within the maritime domain and the operational [and cooperative
[activities that they conduct]{.mark} in the performance of three
functions, which contribute to Alliance security: Strategic function:
the presence of maritime forces [creates strategic and deterrent
effects]{.mark}, including for assurance and messaging, and demonstrates
NATO's intent to operate without constraint and as
required]{.underline}. The flexibility of maritime forces provides
nearly instant availability of inherently tailorable force packages
yielding a range of attractive, measured and viable political and
military options. [Security function: maritime security has become a
mainstay of NATO's maritime activities. Allies have developed
sophisticated skills, tactics, techniques and procedures associated with
maritime security]{.underline}. The maintenance of a safe and secure
maritime environment can be undertaken through a range of maritime
security operations and/or activities. Maritime forces can provide a
ready and flexible mechanism and significant versatility for a broad
range and scale of missions and tasks. Warfighting function: during
peacetime and in a crisis, [[maritime forces are primarily
deterrent]{.mark} in nature]{.underline}. [[They]{.mark} can
[**contribute to conventional operations**, nuclear deterrence]{.mark}
and [ballistic missile defence]{.mark}, to advance Alliance security
interests]{.underline}. Allies' maritime forces provide deterrence and
defence in their contiguous seas, extending the defence of their
national territory and can project power at distance. Maritime forces
can rapidly transition from low-intensity to high-intensity missions and
tasks[. Surface, sub-surface and above-surface capabilities and forces
work together to exercise sea denial or control, support reinforcement,
protect assets, project power and support joint forces and joint
effects. [Maritime]{.mark} and joint [exercises are]{.mark} key to
maintaining and [developing warfighting]{.mark} competencies and
improving Allies' combined maritime skills and readiness for all
operations. Some [areas]{.mark} and competencies [being incorporated
into]{.mark} future [exercises include high-end **warfighting
capacities**, such as]{.mark} the protection of sea lines of
communication and rapid reinforcement, [carrier strike, amphibious
forces, anti-submarine warfare, land attack, deep-precision strike, and
integrated air and missile defence; countering hybrid threats in the
maritime domain]{.mark}; and countering threats in cyber
space.]{.underline}

[[Security cooperation]{.mark} tasks]{.underline} may include the use of
coastal riverine, construction, EOD, mobile diving, intelligence,

or conduct security force assistance activities to build partner
capability or capacity. The USCG's Atlantic Area Command and Pacific
Area Command have OPCON of the Coast Guard's deployable specialized

#### W/M -- Maritime domain awareness includes disruptive tech like AI

**Sakhuja '18** \[Vijay; 06/11/18; MPhil and PhD degrees from the
Jawaharlal Nehru University, Senior Fellow Gujarat National Law
University, \"Artificial Intelligence and Maritime Domain Awareness,\"
Society for the Study of Peace and Conflict,
<https://sspconline.org/index.php/opinion/artificial-intelligence-maritime-domain-awareness-vijay-sakhuja-110618>
//smarx, AZG\]

There are [several [disruptive technologies]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[find **application in the maritime** domain beyond warfighting.
**Among these**]{.mark} Artificial Intelligence
([AI]{.mark})]{.underline}, its cutting edge application in [[machine
learning]{.underline}]{.mark} (ML), internet of things (IOT), big data,
and blockchain [[can]{.mark} profoundly **[change the]{.mark} management
of the [maritime ]{.mark}**[domain]{.mark}]{.underline}, [including
search and rescue]{.underline}, humanitarian assistance and disaster
relief, combating illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing,
counter piracy, counter trafficking, environment protection and illegal
migration, to name a few.

[A robust]{.underline} **[[AI based maritime domain
awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}** (MDA) [[can]{.underline}]{.mark}
potentially [[contribute to **transparency**]{.mark} across the
seas]{.underline} and oceans [[by integrating]{.mark} multi-source
[data]{.mark},]{.underline} analytics and advanced Cloud services
[[making data accessible]{.mark} much more easily.]{.underline} It is
possible **[[to track vessels]{.underline}]{.mark}**, determine the type
of cargo and even the business behavior of shipping companies, including
freight forwarders.

An ideal [[AI-based MDA]{.underline}]{.mark} architecture [**[could be
built]{.underline}** [around]{.underline}]{.mark} [numerous diversified
technical devices and systems such as radar]{.underline} (ships,
aircraft, shore), [[vessel monitoring]{.mark} systems]{.underline}
(VMS), satellite supported systems (AIS and LRIT), [UAVs]{.underline},
drones, imagery, open source intelligence (OSINT), etc. to generate
data. Thereafter, [advanced algorithms fuse data]{.underline} from
different sources including data from vessel profile library developed
from stored [knowledge [and]{.mark} provide automated [threat
evaluation]{.mark} or early warning on anomalous activities at
sea]{.underline}, understand and quantify risks[, [and]{.mark} provide
timely alerts of possible threats or **[suspicious
ships]{.mark}**]{.underline} before reaching their destinations. In
essence, [this helps [to **minimize info**]{.mark}**rmation
[gap,]{.mark}**]{.underline} thus limiting the number of vessels that
require investigation.

The fishing industry, which has in recent times been under suspicion for
engaging in IUU activities, can be monitored and tracked. AI enabled
drones can recognize the identification number of the fishing vessel,
count people on board, determine if it is inside a protected area and
verify its permit. Google is already using the image-recognition
technology in conjunction with AI to locate vessels engaged in IUU
activity.

As far as search and rescue at sea is concerned, navies and coast guards
are often pressed into operations to rescue fishermen during cyclones
and hurricanes. It will be possible in the future for ships to launch
autonomous vehicles to respond to emergencies to help locate and rescue
victims that have been left stranded, immobile or are sinking.

Another interesting application of AI enabled drones is their use in
safety of beach goers against sharks. For instance, in Australia, shark
detection system powered by artificial intelligence will be able to
deliver "live-video feed to a drone operator who then uses the
shark-spotting software to identify sharks in real time and with more
accuracy than the human eye."

[[The maritime domain is in the cusp of]{.mark} a **major transformation
and [disruptive tech]{.mark}nologies** will be advanced to overtake the
skill, ability and judgment of humans.]{.underline} The trends indicate
that [that day is not far when artificial intelligence would overtake
human intelligence]{.underline} and smart tools will enable
technology-driven management of information and intelligence [and
provide a comprehensive and credible real-time MDA.]{.underline}

So long as these transformations do not challenge the natural human
values of empathy and compassion, they are welcome and must be harnessed
to address and respond to illegal activities that challenge good order
at sea. In this context, Google's decision to abandon [Project Maven is
a welcome decision and is a trigger for exploiting disruptive
technologies to deliver public goods and services at the
seas.]{.underline}

#### CI: Maritime domain awareness is [anything associated]{.underline} with security -- that [includes]{.underline} machine learning

**Saildrone '20** \[10/20/20; \"Machine Learning Will Automate Maritime
Domain Awareness,\"
<https://www.saildrone.com/news/ai-ml-maritime-domain-awareness-mda>
//smarx, AZG\]

Saildrone uncrewed surface vehicles (USVs) have conducted extensive data
collection missions around the world, continuously collecting
meteorological and oceanographic variables above and below the sea
surface and building an unprecedented at-sea image library of some four
million images. This image library is the foundation of
[[Saildrone's]{.underline} **[machine learning]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[software, **[unlocking new maritime domain
awareness]{.mark}**]{.underline} (MDA) **[[capabilities at
sea]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a challenging environment where every pixel
is moving across every frame.

[[MDA is]{.mark} the effective understanding of **[anything
associated]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[with the safety]{.mark} and security
[of the]{.mark} **global [maritime
domain]{.mark}**]{.underline}---illegal fishing, drug enforcement, and
limiting intrusion into protected marine sanctuaries. [[The]{.mark}
United States [Coast Guard was tasked with exploring]{.mark} the
feasibility, costs, and benefits of improving [m]{.mark}aritime
[d]{.mark}omain [a]{.mark}wareness [using a]{.mark} low-cost
**[autonomous system like the saildrone.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
Throughout the month of October, [[Saildrone]{.mark} is demonstrating
how its platform [could be used to conduct MDA]{.mark}
missions]{.underline} offshore and in remote areas of the ocean.

Saildrone USVs are equipped with a specially built 360° camera system
integrated with a GPU. Computer vision is based on deep neural networks;
the patterns within the collected data set are represented by numbers,
which in turn are mathematically mapped to define a model that a
computer can be trained to recognize. Saildrone achieved this over
several years, leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS)'s
industrial-strength large-scale cloud-based compute infrastructure.

The Saildrone MDA solution combines the cameras, automated
identification system (AIS) receivers, and optional radar or infrared
cameras for night-time capabilities. [The cameras capture images on a
very high frequency and the crucial [ML software **fuses**]{.mark} **the
[data]{.mark}** from all sensors]{.underline}, recognizes and identifies
targets of interest, and automatically alerts the end-user in real time.

Each vehicle can operate for up to 12 months at sea. They use wind power
for forward propulsion and are virtually silent while operating, sailing
autonomously from waypoint to waypoint. Alternately, saildrones can be
tasked to sail in a "racetrack" formation or hold station. [The key to
[machine learning is continuous training]{.mark} of the model; [the more
saildrones]{.mark} that are [deployed]{.mark} and the longer they are
deployed, **[the better the Saildrone]{.mark} model
becomes.**]{.underline}

During the October demonstration, a fleet of [Saildrone
USVs]{.underline} will illustrate a variety of use cases and real-world
examples to show the system's [effectiveness for improving maritime
domain awareness]{.underline} in remote areas of the Pacific Ocean.
