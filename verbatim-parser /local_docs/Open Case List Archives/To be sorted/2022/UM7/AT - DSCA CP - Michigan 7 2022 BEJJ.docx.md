☺

The [justification for]{.underline} the [aid has varied. **Some** have
**made
the [case](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/how-to-deal-with-the-kremlin-created-crisis-in-europe/) that**
U.S. **military assistance** to Ukraine can change Russia\'s
calculus]{.underline} now, [possibly **deterring Moscow** from launching
an attack. Others claim that aid to the Ukrainian military can **have a
real impact on** a possible **fight** with the Russians, making it
meaningfully more challenging for the Kremlin to achieve victory and
ruling out certain military options Russia might be
considering]{.underline}. And there are also voices who call for
additional capabilities merely to raise costs for Moscow---that is, to
kill more Russian soldiers---so as to create political problems for
President Vladimir Putin at home, although without much expectation that
Ukraine would prevail.

**[None of these arguments is convincing.]{.underline}** That does not
mean security cooperation with Kyiv should cease. It does mean that
[military assistance is not an effective lever for resolving this
crisis.]{.underline}

Since 2014, the United States
has [provided](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/01/joint-statement-on-the-u-s-ukraine-strategic-partnership/) over
\$2.5 billion in military aid to Ukraine, following the Russian
annexation of Crimea and invasion of the Donbass. U.S. assistance to
Ukraine has included the provision of trainers, selected defensive
systems (such as counter-mortar radars), and more recently, Javelin
anti-tank missiles. This assistance has principally aimed to improve
Ukrainian effectiveness in the relatively static conflict against
Russian-backed separatist forces in the Donbass, who are mainly armed
with small arms and light weapons, along with some artillery and
Soviet-era armor.

Crucially, however, Ukraine has mainly not been fighting Russia\'s armed
forces in the Donbass. Yes, Russia has armed, trained, and led the
separatist forces. But even by Kyiv\'s
own [estimates](https://ru.slovoidilo.ua/2021/11/12/novost/obshhestvo/vsu-nazvali-kolichestvo-voennyx-rf-okkupirovannoj-chasti-donbassa),
the vast majority of rebel forces consist of locals---not soldiers of
the regular Russian military. Indeed, the Russian armed forces engaged
directly in the fighting only twice---in [August--September
2014](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49426724) and [January--February
2015](https://www.ukrweekly.com/uwwp/looking-back-at-the-battle-of-debaltseve/)---and
with limited capabilities, although both episodes ended in crushing
Ukrainian defeats.

Moscow has sought to retain some veil of deniability about its
involvement in the conflict, which meant the [Russian military never
used more than a tiny fraction of its capabilities against the
Ukrainians.]{.underline} It applied [just enough force to get the job
done]{.underline} while avoiding protracted, overt interventions. A wide
variety of signature Russian capabilities---including its [air force and
ballistic and cruise missiles---have not been involved]{.underline} in
the fighting at all, even as they have been repeatedly demonstrated in
combat operations in Syria.

The nature of
the [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/russia-ukraine-invasion/2021/12/03/98a3760e-546b-11ec-8769-2f4ecdf7a2ad_story.html) Russian
buildup suggests the expanded war, if it happens, will differ
fundamentally from the past seven years of simmering stalemate. Russia
has the ability to carry out a [large-scale joint offensive
operation](https://www.foi.se/en/foi/reports/report-summary.html?reportNo=FOI-R--4758--SE) involving
tens of thousands of personnel, thousands of armored vehicles, and
hundreds of combat aircraft. It would likely begin with devastating air
and missile strikes from land, air, and naval forces, striking deep into
Ukraine to attack headquarters, airfields, and logistics points.
Ukrainian forces would begin the conflict [nearly
surrounded](https://rochan-consulting.com/the-map-the-ukrainian-military-intelligence/) from
the very start, with Russian forces arrayed along the eastern border,
naval and amphibious forces threatening from the Black Sea in the south,
and the potential (increasingly real) for additional Russian forces
to [deploy into
Belarus](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-belarus-plan-joint-military-drills-february-lukashenko-2022-01-17/) and
threaten from the north, where the border is less than 65 miles from
Kyiv itself.

In short, this war will look nothing like the status quo ante of
conflict in Ukraine, and that undermines the first justification for
U.S. aid: deterring Russia. The [Ukrainian military has been shaped to
fight the conflict in the Donbass and thus poses little deterrent threat
to Russia; provision of U.S. weapons can do nothing to change
that]{.underline}. If [Moscow is willing to launch a major war, invading
the second-largest country in Europe with a population of over 40
million, all while absorbing tremendous economic punishment from the
West,]{.underline} then it is **[unlikely to be deterred by whatever
U.S. military assistance]{.underline}** can be delivered in the coming
weeks. The only weapons systems that could plausibly impose costs that
could change Russia\'s calculus, such as [surface-to-air missiles and
combat aircraft]{.underline}, are ones that the United States would be
highly unlikely to provide the Ukrainians. And, regardless, they [could
not be procured, delivered, and be made operational---to say nothing of
getting the Ukrainian operators trained up to use them---in time to have
an impact on this crisis.]{.underline} Large, modern systems require
extensive training and material support.

Once deterrence fails and a war begins, the Ukrainian armed forces will
find themselves in desperate circumstances almost immediately. Ukraine
does not have anywhere near enough forces to credibly defend against all
the potential avenues of attack, which means it would have to choose
between defending a select set of fixed strong points---ceding control
of other areas---or maneuvering to engage Russian forces that outnumber
them. The line of conflict in the Donbass will be but one of many
fronts. The Ukrainian fortifications there may well look like a
modern-day Maginot Line: prepared for a frontal attack that may never
come and bypassed by the mobile forces of an adversary with
more-advanced aircraft and more-mobile land forces.

Ukraine\'s great size means that the land forces operating there will be
required to move to cover large areas of rural terrain. Mobile
engagements would benefit Russian forces, which are far better trained
and equipped to conduct coordinated air and land maneuver warfare than
their Ukrainian opponents. The Russian military has repeatedly practiced
the use of long-range strike and [tactical fires cued by
drones](http://www.ccw.ox.ac.uk/blog/2018/5/30/the-russian-reconnaissance-fire-complex-comes-of-age) as
well as other means of reconnaissance, both in training and in combat
operations in Syria. Russia\'s combat aircraft and strategic air
defenses give Moscow many more options to control the air and to strike
Ukrainian forces, and most Russian pilots have recent real-world
experience in Syria. The Ukrainian military also largely operates legacy
Soviet weapons; Russian forces have a deep familiarity with the
limitations of these systems and know what tactics to employ to further
reduce their effectiveness.

In short, the [military balance between Russia and Ukraine is so
lopsided in Moscow\'s favor that any assistance Washington might
provide]{.underline} in coming weeks would be [largely irrelevant in
determining the outcome of a conflict]{.underline} should it begin.
Russ[ia\'s advantages in capacity, capability, and geography combine to
pose insurmountable challenges for Ukrainian forces]{.underline} tasked
with defending their country. The [second argument for aid---changing
the course of the war---thus does not hold water.]{.underline}

The third argument for aid is to provide assistance to enable a
Ukrainian insurgency to impose costs on a Russian occupying force. Many
have in mind the historical analogy here of U.S. aid to the mujahideen
in Afghanistan following the Soviet invasion in 1979. Indeed, some are
even recommending providing the same Stinger shoulder-launched
anti-aircraft missiles that plagued the Soviet air force at the time.

If Russia attempts a long-term occupation of areas with lots of hostile
Ukrainians, these forms of support could, on the margins, complicate
matters for Moscow. But U.S. support to a Ukrainian insurgency should be
a matter of last resort during an extended conflict, not a centerpiece
of policy before it has even started. [The prospect of a marginally more
costly occupation is unlikely to make a difference to Moscow if it gets
to that stage; it will have already absorbed far more significant
costs.]{.underline} Russian planners are aware that a lot can go wrong
in a large-scale operation, especially an occupation. If
[Putin]{.underline} takes the decision to [occupy large parts of
Ukraine]{.underline}, it will [not]{.underline} be [because he believes
it will be easy or inexpensive to Russia.]{.underline}

We should also keep in mind that the costs of a war that lasts to the
point of an insurgency campaign in Ukraine will be disproportionately
borne by Ukrainians. At that stage of conflict, thousands---or, more
likely, tens of thousands---of Ukrainians will have died. For any
successes they achieve against the Russian occupiers, Ukrainian
insurgents will be made to pay dearly; the experience of the Syrian
opposition or the Chechen insurgents is not one Americans should wish on
a close partner like Ukraine.

[In normal times, there are many good reasons for the United States to
provide military support to Ukraine. But these are not normal times.
**Military assistance**]{.underline} now [will **at best be marginal in
affecting the outcome of the crisis**]{.underline}. It might be morally
justified to help a U.S. partner at risk of aggression. But [given the
scale of the potential threat to Ukraine and its forces, the most
effective way Washington can help is to work on finding a diplomatic
solution.]{.underline}

☺

In a dramatic series of shifts this week, U.S. President Joe [Biden
and]{.underline} his [NATO allies]{.underline} have
[escalated]{.underline} their [policy of helping to defend Ukraine
against Russian aggression into a policy of undermining the power and
influence of Russia itself.]{.underline} In so doing, some observers
fear, they are [leaving]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [**Putin
little choice but to** surrender or double down militarily, raising the
possibility of **widen**ing his **war beyond Ukraine**.]{.underline}

On Thursday, [Biden urged Congress to **provide \$33
billion**]{.underline} in additional military, economic, and
humanitarian assistance [for Ukraine]{.underline}---more than double the
previous amount---and said he was **[sending a clear
message]{.underline}** to Putin: "You will never succeed in dominating
Ukraine." Beyond that, Biden said in remarks at the White House, the new
policy was intended "to [**punish Russia**n aggression,]{.underline} to
[lessen the risk of future conflicts]{.underline}."

That followed an equally clear declaration this week from U.S. Defense
Secretary Lloyd Austin, who after a meeting in Kyiv with Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelensky said the U.S. objective is now to curtail
Russia's power over the long term so it does not have the "capability to
reproduce" its military assault on Ukraine. "We want to see Russia
weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has
done in invading Ukraine," Austin said in a stopover in Poland.

The [shift]{.underline} may have been what [**prompted** Russian
**Foreign Minister**]{.underline} Sergey Lavrov **[to
declare]{.underline}** afterward that Washington and [the **West** had
**entered** a "**proxy" war** with Russia, **risking another world war
that**, Lavrov warned, could **go nuclear**.]{.underline} "The danger is
serious, real. And we must not underestimate it," Lavrov said.
[Putin]{.underline} also again [suggested]{.underline} this week, as he
has since the beginning of his invasion on Feb. 24, [that he still had
the option of using nuclear weapons against NATO]{.underline}, saying,
"We have all the instruments for this \[to respond to a direct threat to
Russia\]---ones nobody else can boast of. And we will use them, if we
have to."

The newly aggressive U.S. approach won plaudits from many quarters---in
particular from current and former NATO officials who insist the Russian
nuclear counterthreats are only empty rhetoric.

"It's the only way to go forward," said former NATO Secretary-General
Anders Fogh Rasmussen in an interview. "In Putin's thinking it doesn't
make any difference, because he would only claim that the Western policy
is to weaken Russia anyway. So why not speak openly about it? The
mistake we made in the past was to underestimate the ambitions of
Vladimir Putin, to underestimate his brutality. At the same time, we
overestimated the strength of the Russian military."

The new U.S. and NATO strategy is partly based on Ukraine's continuing
battlefield success against Putin, who has been forced to scale down his
ambitions from a full takeover of Ukraine to a major new assault in its
eastern and southern parts. NATO allies including Germany, which until
this week had equivocated on sending heavy offensive weaponry to
Ukraine, have ratcheted up their aid in response. German Chancellor Olaf
Scholz, under political pressure at home and abroad, announced earlier
this week that his country would provide 50 anti-aircraft tanks to
Ukraine.

Yet other [Russia **experts** expressed **worry** that the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and its Western allies
are]{.underline}, in effect, **[crossing]{.underline}** the very
**[redlines]{.underline}** they have avoided until now. [For most of the
two-month conflict, Biden has refused to authorize any military support,
such as major offensive weapons or a no-fly zone, that might be
perceived as putting U.S. or NATO forces in direct conflict with Russia.
Now,]{.underline} some observers worry that with the additional [aid and
tougher economic sanctions]{.underline}, the U.S. president is
**[forcing Putin into a corner]{.underline}** in which he can only fight
on or surrender. The latter course would mean relinquishing Putin's
career-long aim of strengthening Russia against the West. Yet
**[Putin]{.underline}**, who has long said the West's goal was to weaken
or contain Russia, [has **never** been known to
**surrender**]{.underline} during his decade and a half of aggressive
moves against neighboring countries, mainly Ukraine and Georgia.

"[In the Kremlin's eyes the West is out to get Russia. It was unspoken
before. Now it's spoken]{.underline}," said Sean Monaghan, an expert on
Europe at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "If you
combine this with Biden's comments, at his summit in Poland last month,
that 'this man \[Putin\] cannot remain in power,' all that turns this a
territorial war into a wider confrontation and might [**make negotiating
a settlement** to end the war in Ukraine far more **difficult** or even
impossible]{.underline} at the present." (Biden officials later said
that the president was not seeking regime change in Russia.)

George Beebe, a former chief of Russia analysis for the CIA, said that
the [**Biden** administration]{.underline} may be in danger of
[**forgetting** that the "**the most important** national **interest**
that **the U**nited **S**tates **has is avoiding a nuclear conflict**
with Russia."]{.underline} He added that "the [Russians have the ability
to make sure everyone else loses if they lose too.]{.underline} [And
that]{.underline} may be [where we're heading]{.underline}. It's a
dangerous corner to turn."

Perhaps the most worrisome turn of events is that there no longer
appears to be any possibility of a negotiated way out of the
war---despite Putin's statement to visiting United Nations
Secretary-General António Guterres that he still hopes for such a
solution.

"It's one thing to pursue a policy of weakening Putin, quite another to
say it out loud. [We have to **find a way for Putin to achieve a
political solution**]{.underline}, so perhaps it is not wise to state
this," said one senior European diplomat, speaking on condition of
anonymity.

"It's getting more dangerous," said Charles Kupchan, a former senior
U.S. official and now a scholar of international relations at Georgetown
University. ["We **need to start moving** **beyond Javelins and**
anti-tank **missiles and talk about** a **political
endgame**."]{.underline} Or, as Beebe put it, "We need to [find a way of
somehow discreetly conveying to the Russians that we would be willing to
ease sanctions in the context of an **international
settlement.**]{.underline}

#### Ukrainian arms sales are the biggest lapses in oversight in recent history- that independently causes escalation.

**Desiderio** et al **'22** \[Andrew; 2 June; Studied journalism @ GW;
POLITICO, "Pentagon vs. Congress tension builds over monitoring billions
in Ukraine aid,"
<https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/02/congress-pentagon-ukraine-aid-oversight-00036463>\]

[The Pentagon was already struggling to keep up with
Congress']{.underline} demands for [oversight]{.underline} of its
spending. Then, lawmakers earmarked an extra \$40 billion for Ukraine.

[[Concerns are mounting]{.underline}]{.mark} on Capitol Hill
[[about]{.mark} the [Biden]{.mark} administration['s ability to]{.mark}
properly [account for the **unprecedented wave of cash** and]{.mark} to
track the [thousands of]{.mark} U.S. [weapons heading to
Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} for its war with Russia. And given the
Pentagon's recent track record concerning congressional oversight, it's
coming under increased scrutiny from members of both parties --- from
progressive Elizabeth Warren to libertarian Rand Paul.

Some lawmakers are already warning the Biden administration that a
future aid package could lose the overwhelming congressional support
that has been a hallmark of the previous efforts. A key barometer will
be the Pentagon's handling and complete accounting of the funds, which
has lagged in other areas, sparking scrutiny from congressional
committees.

Sen. Warren (D-Mass.), a member of the Armed Services Committee, said in
an email that a full accounting of the already-appropriated funding will
be "critically important for both past and future funding requests."

"[[The U.S.]{.mark} government [is sending billions]{.mark}]{.underline}
in humanitarian, economic, and military assistance [to help the
Ukrainian people overcome Putin's brutal war, [and the American people
expect **strong oversight**]{.mark} **by Congress**]{.underline} and
full accounting from the Department of Defense," she added.

Pentagon spokesperson Marine Corps Lt. Col. Anton Semelroth said the
department is "committed" to transparency with the public and with
Congress about the security assistance funds. But he stressed that war
involves risk, and called on Russia to end the conflict.

"Risk of diversion is one of many considerations that we routinely
assess when evaluating any potential arms transfer," Semelroth said. "In
this case, risk would be considerably minimized by the full withdrawal
from Ukraine by Russian forces."

While all Democrats and most Republicans voted for the aid package in
May, it's unclear whether that coalition can stick together if President
Joe Biden asks Congress for more money before the end of the fiscal
year, as many on the Hill predict will be the case. [[The Pentagon
already owes]{.mark} Congress [a **backlog** of reports]{.mark} on its
spending for European security, and]{.underline} progressives and
conservatives alike have said [[they'll be looking for more
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} before approving another cash infusion.

[[Amid]{.mark} the Pentagon-Hill [squabbling, Biden announced]{.mark} on
Wednesday]{.underline} the first tranche of military assistance from
[[the massive]{.mark} funding [bill]{.mark}]{.underline} that cleared
both chambers last month. And [[oversight concerns]{.mark} are at the
[forefront]{.mark}]{.underline}, as [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} newly
announced [\$700 million [package]{.mark} for the first time
[includes]{.mark} a more [advanced]{.mark}, precision-guided [rocket
system that]{.mark} will [allow Ukraine to strike]{.mark} targets even
further away --- potentially in **[Russia]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The Biden administration deliberated for weeks over whether to send the
High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, known as HIMARS, and medium or
long-range munitions. [Officials worried that providing [longer-range
rockets could provoke]{.mark} Russian President Vladimir [Putin into
**escalating**]{.mark} the conflict.]{.underline} They ultimately
decided to send the shorter-range rockets, which can reach 48 miles,
instead of the longer-range munitions, which can fly 190 miles.

Of[ficials worry about the department's ability to keep track of all the
weapons the U.S. is providing]{.underline}, including the HIMARS, [as
well as ensuring they are being used effectively]{.underline}.
[[Kyiv]{.mark} has given Washington "assurances" that it
will]{.underline} only use the rockets on the battlefield in Ukraine,
and [not to strike targets in Russia]{.underline}, senior administration
officials said. [But they [did not detail]{.mark} those
[assurances]{.mark}, and there is concern that the Pentagon has no way
to monitor the use of the weapons.]{.underline}

Yet any such negotiation looks less likely than ever. Both sides appear

eastern Ukraine should be acknowledged. But Zelensky has since told
European Council President Charles Michel that, in light of Russian
atrocities, [[Ukrainian public]{.mark} opinion was against negotiations
and [favored continuing]{.mark} the war.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, Finland and Sweden have indicated they are interested in
joining the NATO alliance, breaking with their longtime policy of
nonalignment and potentially creating a new hair-trigger environment
along Russia's northern border. That would deliver a devastating blow to
Putin, who has often cited NATO's eastward expansion as a casus belli
for his full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

And there is little prospect that any of these tensions will abate
anytime soon. Austin also convened a 40-nation "Ukraine Contact Group"
this week that was readying itself for what Joint Chiefs of Staff
Chairman Mark Milley has said is likely a "protracted conflict" that
will be "at least measured in years."

Biden has not said what the U.S. response might be if Putin deploys
tactical or strategic nuclear weapons. Moreover, neither side has set
any clear rules in the post-Cold War environment for the deployment of
nuclear weapons---especially as Cold War-era arms agreements such as the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty have been shelved and nuclear
weapon delivery systems have become faster and more governed by
automatic digitized systems. Under a [[Kremlin]{.mark} policy known as
"[escalating to de-escalate]{.mark}"---threatening to [go nuclear if the
West tries to stop him]{.mark}---Putin has]{.underline} year by year
[[reintroduced nuclear weapons into]{.mark} his conventional war
[calculations]{.mark}]{.underline}. During his two decades in power, he
has authorized the construction of nuclear-powered cruise missiles,
transoceanic nuclear-armed torpedoes, hypersonic glide vehicles, and
more low-yield nuclear weapons on the European continent.

[Russia told the United States to stop sending more arms to Ukraine,
warning that large **Western deliveries of weapons** were **inflaming
the conflict** and would lead to more losses,]{.underline} Moscow\'s
ambassador to Washington said.

Russia\'s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people,
displaced millions more and raised fears of a wider confrontation
between Russia and the United States - by far the world\'s two biggest
nuclear powers.

The United States has ruled out sending its own or NATO forces to
Ukraine but Washington and its European allies have supplied weapons to
Kyiv such as drones, Howitzer heavy artillery, anti-aircraft Stinger and
anti-tank Javelin missiles.

Anatoly Antonov, [Russia\'s ambassador to the United States, said such
**arms deliveries** were aimed at weakening Russia but that they were
escalating the conflict in Ukraine while **undermining efforts to
reach** some sort of **peace agreement.**]{.underline}

\"[What the **Americans** are doing is **pouring oil on the
flames**]{.underline},\" Antonov told the Rossiya 24 TV channel. \"[I
see only an attempt to raise the stakes, to aggravate the situation, to
see **more losses**.]{.underline}\"

Earlier this year, [the National [D]{.mark}efense [I]{.mark}ndustrial
[A]{.mark}ssociation released [Vital Signs]{.mark} 2022]{.underline}:
The Health and Readiness of the Defense Industrial Base, the third
edition of the flagship study. [For the first time, the report [scored
the health of the industrial base]{.mark} business environment
[below]{.mark} a [passing]{.mark} level.]{.underline}

The score does not reflect upon individual companies. [[Vital Signs
measures]{.underline}]{.mark} the defense industry's health through
eight conditions that describe the defense business environment over the
past year: [demand, [production]{.mark} inputs, **[innovation]{.mark}**,
[supply chain]{.mark}, competition, industrial security, political and
regulatory environment [and productive capacity]{.mark}; and surge
readiness]{.underline}.

[These vital signs]{.underline} are an attempt to [[move beyond
traditional]{.mark} defense industry [analysis,
which]{.mark}]{.underline} heavily [relies upon]{.underline} the
financial performances of [a few companies, [ignores **key indicators**

[[contractors]{.underline}]{.mark} that are [not publicly

Unlike traditional medical vital signs measured on the spot, our
conditions are observed remotely, both in time and space, using publicly
available data and results from an annual survey. We believe this
information reflects the state of the defense industrial base during the
first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Based on the findings, we offer the following policy prescriptions.

First, as the Russian-Ukrainian War continues, Ukraine will need to be
resupplied and [[U.S. stocks]{.mark} will [need to be
replenished]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the first year of the pandemic, the
"[[productive capacity]{.mark} and surge readiness" vital sign
[demonstrated]{.mark} last year's [largest decline]{.mark}]{.underline},
largely due to weakness in the overall economy. In the 2022 survey,

### 2AC -- No Tradeoff -- Aid Inevitable

☺

The escalating [brutality of the war in Ukraine]{.underline} has
[**dampened voices**]{.underline} on both the right and left [skeptical
of the United States' involving itself in armed conflict]{.underline}
overseas, [fueling a rush by Congress to pour huge amounts of money
into]{.underline} a potentially lengthy and costly [offensive against
Russia **with few questions or reservations** raised.]{.underline}

Under pressure to present a united front as President Vladimir V.
Putin's forces carry out a campaign of atrocities across Ukraine,
[lawmakers in both political parties who have previously railed against
skyrocketing military budgets and entanglements in intractable conflicts
abroad have gone largely silent]{.underline} about what is fast becoming
a major military effort drawing on American resources.

The [House]{.underline} on Tuesday night [passed a \$40 billion military
and humanitarian aid package for Ukraine in an overwhelming 368 to 57
vote]{.underline}, weeks [after]{.underline} [lawmakers overwhelmingly
approved \$13.6 billion in emergency aid for the war
effort.]{.underline} That [total --- roughly **\$53 billion over two
months**]{.underline} --- goes [beyond what President Biden requested
and is poised to amount to the **largest foreign aid
package**]{.underline} to move through Congress **[in]{.underline}** at
least [**two decades**.]{.underline}

It also [comes at a time when]{.underline} the two
**[parties]{.underline}** have been **[unable to reach agreement to
invest in domestic programs]{.underline}**. They include the [extension
of a tax
credit](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/02/business/economy/child-tax-credit.html) that
pulled millions of American children out of poverty and even [a pandemic
response
package](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/09/us/politics/biden-pandemic-response-funding.html) to
control the spread of the coronavirus, as [Republicans and some
Democrats raise concerns that such spending could exacerbate inflation
and increase the federal deficit.]{.underline}

[**But** stunned by the grisly images from Ukraine and **leery of
turning** their **backs on** a **country whose suffering has been on**
vivid **display** for the world, many lawmakers have put aside their
skepticism and quietly agreed to the sprawling tranches of aid, keeping
to themselves their concerns about the war and questions about the Biden
administration's strategy for American involvement.]{.underline}

And as Mr. [Biden's **requests** to Congress **for money** to fund the
war effort have **spiraled upward**, leaders in **both parties** have
largely **refrained from questioning them.**]{.underline} Instead, the
packages have swelled to accommodate the two parties' competing
priorities, with Republicans adding money for military assistance and
Democrats insisting that be matched by an equal addition for
humanitarian aid.

They have been backed by pleas of urgency from both Ukrainian leaders
and the Biden administration, which warned Congress this week that more
aid would be needed before May 19 to continue providing military
support.

On Tuesday, hours before the House was to vote, Oksana Markarova, the
Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, met separately with
Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, where the measure is now
headed, to personally call for swift passage of the package.

"Her people are dying. They're running out of supplies and ammunition.
They need our help quickly," said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois,
the No. 2 Democrat, describing Ms. Markarova's message as: "Thank you
for all our help, but please speed it up."

The result has been that, at least for now, [Congress is quickly and
nearly unanimously embracing historic tranches of foreign aid with
little public debate about the Biden administration's
strategy]{.underline}, whether the volume of military assistance could
escalate the conflict, or whether domestic priorities are being pushed
aside to accommodate the huge expenditures overseas.

"Time is of the essence --- and we cannot afford to wait," Speaker Nancy
Pelosi of California wrote to lawmakers in a letter on Tuesday ahead of
the vote. "[With this **aid package**, America **sends** a resounding
**message** to the world of our unwavering determination to **stand
with** the courageous people of **Ukraine until victory is
won."**]{.underline}

### 1AR -- No Tradeoff -- Aid Inevitable

[Why is Congress prepared to spend billions of dollars for new aid to
Ukraine]{.underline} without requiring offsetting tax increases or
spending cuts at the same time lawmakers are demanding that more
COVID-19-related therapeutics and testing be fully paid
for[?]{.underline}

**[It can't be about the money.]{.underline}** The next round of
[Ukraine aid will cost about \$40 billion]{.underline}, even more than
President Biden requested. By contrast, it looks [like Congress is
considering only about \$10 billion]{.underline}, or one-quarter as
much, [for the COVID-19 health bill. If you are worried about the budget
deficit, why fret about a \$10 billion bill and ignore \$40 billion in
new spending?]{.underline}

It can't be the seriousness of the problem, either.

Blocking Russian aggression in Ukraine certainly has critical
geopolitical value. But the pandemic has [killed about 1 million
Americans](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases-deaths-testing-trends),
and more than [6 million worldwide](https://covid19.who.int/). And
future waves of the virus are almost certain. Just last week, the White
House warned of 100 million more US infections in the fall and winter
without more vaccines, therapeutics, and testing.

It seems a stretch to argue that support for Ukraine is more important
than treatments for COVID-19. So [why is one spending initiative likely
to be paid for with borrowed money and the other is mired in arguments
about how to pay for it?]{.underline}

Politics

[Well, **politics of course.**]{.underline}

Congress (really, the Senate) has spent weeks fiddling over the [Ukraine
money]{.underline}. But, in reality, [there is broad bipartisan support
for that assistance]{.underline}. Democrats overwhelmingly back it. And
so do most Republicans.

[To help make the
point](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/15/mcconnell-maga-ukraine-visit-00032572),
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and others in the GOP
leadership made a high-profile trip to Kiev over the weekend to express
their support for the beleaguered country.

Only a handful of isolationist Republicans opposed the aid measure. One,
Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), single-handedly delayed the bill for days. But
the urgently needed money will pass relatively quickly, at least as
measured in Senate-time.

That brings us to those payfors.

Losing focus

Because Congress rarely can agree on how to pay for anything it does,
the Ukraine bill would become hopelessly stalled if it included
offsetting tax increases or spending cuts. The merits of Ukraine funding
would be long forgotten while lawmakers squabbled over how to pay for
it. Odds are, they'd still be arguing well after Vladimir Putin's
victory parade.

And that, of course, is exactly what happened to the COVID-19 funding
bill. Republicans, who opposed the merits of the COVID-19 bill for a
long, complicated list of reasons, successfully stalled the measure
simply by demanding that it be paid for.

That shifted the debate from the need for drugs and testing to those
offsets. Add to that the growing public view that the pandemic is behind
us, and Congress lost the all-important sense of urgency it needs to do
anything these days.

Multiple roadblocks

Republicans have thrown several roadblocks in the way of the new
COVID-19 money. First was their demand that it be funded with unspent
pandemic relief dollars that initially were earmarked for state and
local governments. Then, they shifted gears and insisted the bill also
bar Biden from lifting a public health restriction on migrants crossing
the US border with Mexico.

Biden initially hoped to get the money added to a huge government
spending bill passed in March. But the argument over how to pay for it
sidetracked that effort.

Biden then tried to link it to the less controversial Ukraine aid. But
now, given the political realities and the urgent need to get weapons
and assistance to Ukraine, Biden has agreed to split the bills. That
likely will doom the pandemic funding for many more months. And if many
public health experts are to be believed, it may result in more sickness
and perhaps more death.

The deficit cudgel

[The real story,]{.underline} of course, [is that the vast **majority of
politicians** in either party **do not care about the deficit**. When
they demand that new spending be paid for, they really are saying they
don't want to spend the money at all.]{.underline} That was the message
Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) sent to his fellow Democrats when he blocked
Biden's Build Back Better social spending and climate bill last year.
And it appears to be the message Republicans are sending with the
pandemic funding.

[Lawmakers may appear to be fiscal hypocrites. But, really, their
disinterest in the deficit is remarkably consistent. They just are
**using** their **alleged deficit concerns as a cudgel to kill bills
they don't like.**]{.underline}
