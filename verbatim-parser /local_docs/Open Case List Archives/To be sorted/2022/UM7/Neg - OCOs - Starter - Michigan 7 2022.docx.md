#### No [large-scale]{.underline} Russian cyberattacks

Between the United States of America and Russia"

On the other hand, [[both]{.mark} states might [not desire]{.mark}
further [escalation]{.mark}, preferring to restrain the conflict to
cyberspace]{.underline}. [Each would follow the "tit-for-tat" logic and
accuse each other]{.underline} **[while [never reaching]{.mark} a
tipping point where the conflict spills over to a [conventional]{.mark}
war]{.underline}**. Such a tipping point would be linked to the
intensity of the attack or the nature of the targets. [Both
[nations]{.mark} would [keep]{.mark} the [cyberattacks **small**]{.mark}
enough not to trigger a bigger reaction. The same would be observed on
the choice of targets, with both avoiding certain critical or sensitive
targets, for instance critical infrastructures.]{.underline} In order to
contain the conflict in cyberspace, both states would have **[[to
demonstrate]{.mark} their [restraint]{.mark} by selecting [options with
low]{.mark} risk of [miscalc]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}** (Lin, 2012,
pp. 64--66). In the future, [it might also be possible to [see]{.mark} a
[deescalation in]{.mark} the form of the emergence of an international
treaty or at least further **bilateral [treaties]{.mark}**
[between]{.mark} the [USA and Russia]{.mark} on
cyberattacks]{.underline}. For example, during the last few years,
businesses in the USA were often hacked and spied on by the Chinese
military. These intrusions were mostly cyber-economic-espionage and were
said to have supported the theft of billions of dollars' worth of
intellectual property (Bamford, 2016). [In]{.underline} September [2015,
the USA and China signed an agreement engaging both countries not to
support or conduct cyber-theft of intellectual property]{.underline}.
Moreover, the parties have made the commitment not to use cyberattacks
against each other's critical infrastructures in peace-time and to
support the establishment of international behavioral norms in
cyberspace (Rosenfeld, 2015). [Both states also highlighted the fact
that they could not control each individual in their country and
therefore could not be held responsible for individual
acts.]{.underline} Since then it seems that the number of attacks on
commercial targets has diminished (Timm, 2016). Former President Obama
suggested the creation of a position of cybersecurity ambassador to deal
with bilateral or multilateral treaties concerning cyber-norms (Lee,
2016). For this kind of de-escalation to take effect, the termination of
the conflict at hand must be the stated aim of both parties. A clear
common understanding of the terms of agreement is required and must be
based on trust-building efforts, as well as the assurance of mutual
adherence. The difficulty of tracking the implementation of such
agreements in cyberspace has been an obstacle preventing more states
consenting to such solutions (Lin, 2012, pp. 62--64). Nevertheless, **[a
[dialogue on cyberspace]{.mark} already [exists]{.mark} between the USA
and Russia]{.underline}** since July 2013. This **[[cooperation
includes]{.underline}]{.mark}** Confidence Building Measures
(**[[CBM]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [such as the creation of working groups
on the issue of ICT security, exchange of information between the two
national]{.underline} Computer Emergency Response Teams
([[CERT]{.underline}), **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the creation of
a [direct communication]{.mark} line [to]{.mark} directly
[manage]{.mark} ICT [incidents]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Segal, 2016; The
White House, Office of the Press Secretary, 2013). In October 2016,
former President Obama used the latter to inform Russian President Putin
that the USA was accusing Russia of interference in the election process
(Ignatius, 2016). Furthermore, Russia and the USA take part in the UN
GGE supporting the future establishment of international norms on
actions in cyberspace. [They stated that international law can be
applied in cyberspace and therefore, the rules of proportionality and
limited collateral damage should also be respected in
cyberattacks]{.underline} (Ignatius, 2016; United Nations General
Assembly, 2015). These examples demonstrate that **[even though the two
states are involved in a "tit-for-tat" logic in their relations on a
tactical level, [there was]{.mark} still a [dialogue on the strategic
level]{.mark}]{.underline}**, at least until 2015. The recent
cyberattacks in USA and the election of Donald Trump as US President,
bring new uncertainties.

#### No nuclear retal

**Tucker '18** \[Patrick; Feb 2; Technology Editor for Defense One, MA
from Johns Hopkins University, BA from Sarah Lawrence College, Former
Deputy Editor for The Futurist; "No, the US Won't Respond to A Cyber
Attack with Nukes,"
https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2018/02/no-us-wont-respond-cyber-attack-nukes/145700\]

**[[No]{.mark}, the [US Won't Respond to]{.mark} A [Cyber]{.mark} Attack
[with Nukes]{.mark}]{.underline}** Defense leaders won't completely rule
out the possibility. [But [it's]{.mark} a **very, very, [very
remote]{.mark}** possibility]{.underline}. [The idea that the U.S. is
building]{.underline} new [low-yield nuclear weapons to respond to a
cyber attack is **"not true,"**]{.underline} military leaders told
reporters in the runup to the Friday release of the new Nuclear Posture
Review. "The people who say we lowered the threshold for the use of
nuclear weapons are saying, 'but we want these low-yield nuclear weapons
so that we can answer a cyber attack because we're so bad at cyber
security.' That's just fundamentally not true," Gen. Paul Selva, vice
chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff, said Tuesday at a meeting with
reporters. [It's an [idea]{.mark}]{.underline} that [military
[leaders]{.mark} have been **[push]{.mark}**ing [back against]{.mark}
since the **N**ew **Y**ork **T**imes ran a]{.underline} Jan. 16 [story
headlined, **"Pentagon Suggests Countering Devastating Cyberattacks With
Nuclear Arms."**]{.underline} When would the U.S. launch a nuclear
attack in response to a non-nuclear event? The Defense Department says
[[the threshold **hasn't changed**]{.mark} since]{.underline} the
[Obama]{.underline} administration's own nuclear posture review in 2010,
but a draft of the new review that leaked online caused a bit of drama
in its attempts to dispel "ambiguity." The new review gives examples of
"non-nuclear strategic attacks," Robert Soofer, deputy assistant
secretary for nuclear and missile defense policy, told reporters on
Thursday. "It could be catastrophic attacks against civilian
populations, against infrastructure. It could be an attack using a
non-nuclear weapon against our nuclear command-and-control \[or\]
early-warning satellites. But [[we **don't talk** about
cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}." In his own conversation with reporters,
Selva broadened "early warning" systems to include ones that provide
"indications of warning that are important to our detection of an
attack." He also emphasized, "We never said 'cyber.'" [There's a reason
for that]{.underline}. While [[cyber]{.mark} attacks]{.underline} on
physical infrastructure can be very dangerous, they [[are **unlikely to
kill enough**]{.mark} people [to provoke a]{.mark} U.S. nuclear
[response]{.mark}]{.underline}. An National Academies of Science and
Engineering analysis of the vulnerability of U.S. infrastructure makes
that point. [A]{.underline} major [cyber attack could cut off electrical
power]{.underline}, resulting in "people dying from heat or cold
exposure, etc.," said Granger Morgan, co-director of the Carnegie Mellon
Electricity Industry Center and one of the chairs of the report. "A
large outage of long duration could cover many states and last for weeks
or longer. Whether and how many casualties there could be would depend
on things like what the weather was during the outage."
[It's]{.underline} a huge problem but [**[not]{.mark}** an event
[resulting in]{.mark} tens of [thousands of]{.mark} immediate
[deaths]{.mark}]{.underline}. Contrast that with a nuclear attack on a
city like Moscow, even one using a device of 6 kilotons, much smaller
than the ones the United States used against Japanese targets in World
War II. The immediate result: there would be 40,000 deaths, according to
the online nuclear simulation tool NukeMap. [Russia]{.underline} has
[demonstrated]{.underline} a [willingness]{.underline} to take down
power services with cyber attacks, as they did in Ukraine on Christmas
Eve 2015. [But]{.underline} these [[attacks were **brief** and occured
in]{.mark} the **context of [actual fighting]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
other words, **[the [worst]{.mark}]{.underline}** cyber physical
**[[attack]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[top experts believe credible
likely [does not meet the threshold]{.mark} that the [Defense]{.mark}
Department [has]{.mark} set out [for]{.mark} deploying [a
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon]{.underline}**.

#### Cyber attacks won't take down the grid

**Craig '16** \[Victoria; Feb 2; Analyst at Fox Business, Citing the
Senior Manager of Industrial Control Systems at Mandiant, "The U.S.
Power Grid is \'Vulnerable,\' But Don\'t Panic Just Yet",
http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2016/02/02/u-s-power-grid-is-vulnerable-but-dont-panic-just-yet.html\]

The idea of the nation\'s power grids becoming the next battleground for
cyber warriors could make hacking into consumers' credit card accounts
and personal information seem like child's play. [While U.S. power
companies are likely targeted by foreign governments]{.underline} and
others in increasingly sophisticated breaches, **[actually [shutting
off]{.mark} the lights]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline} **[causing
chaos]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[far more
[complicated]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}[than many pundits make it
seem.]{.underline} Dan [Scali]{.underline}, [senior manager of
industrial control systems at Mandiant, a cybersecurity consulting arm
of FireEye
([FEYE](http://www.foxbusiness.com/quote.html?stockTicker=FEYE)),]{.underline}
[explained]{.underline} that [while cyber criminals]{.underline} [may
gain [access]{.mark} to power and utility data systems]{.underline},
[it]{.underline} **[[doesn't]{.underline}]{.mark}** necessarily
**[[mean]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the result will be [a]{.mark} **power
[outage]{.mark}** []{.mark}and a **total takedown** of power grid
control systems.]{.underline} In other words, [the power [grid
is]{.mark} controlled by **[more than just]{.mark} a panel** of digital
[buttons. ]{.mark}]{.underline}["[Losing]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
[control]{.mark} system is bad]{.underline} from the perspective that it
takes you out of your normal mode of operations of being able to control
everything from one command center, [but]{.underline} [it [**doesn't**
mean]{.mark} you've lost control or all the **[lights go
out]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[in the city\]," Scali explained. While many
of the systems have been modernized to include digitized control panels,
[if a hacker were to infiltrate the system, [a utility worker could
still]{.mark} have the ability to]{.underline} **[[manually
control]{.mark} the [machines]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}[by]{.underline} **[flipping a switch]{.underline}**, pushing a
button, or tripping a breaker. As the world saw with the recent attack
in Ukraine, which caused a blackout for 80,000 customers of the nation's
western utility, the biggest problem may be ensuring the power grid's
control systems are not vulnerable to cyber break ins. The January
attack in Ukraine was likely caused by a corrupted Microsoft Word
attachment that allowed remote control over the computer, according to
the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Scali said [[there was **no
ev**]{.mark}**idence** from the incident in Ukraine that the hacker's
[**malware**]{.mark} was able to **physically [shut down]{.mark}** the
[power]{.mark}.]{.underline} "It wiped out machines, deleted all the
files. Kill disk malware made it impossible to remotely control things.
It caused chaos on the business network, and the area where control
system operations sat. But the attacker, we believe, would have had to
actually used the control system to cause load shedding, which caused
the power to go out, or trip breakers to cause the actual problem.
Malware itself didn't turn the power out," Scali said. He said what most
likely happened in that incident was the hacker stole user credentials
and logged into the system remotely. The bottom line: Yes, a similar
event could happen in the U.S. And corporate America is concerned. A
recent survey released in January on the state of information security,
conducted by consulting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers, showed
cybersecurity as one of the biggest concerns among the top brass at U.S.
power and utilities firms. Part of the problem, Brad Bauch, security and
cyber sector leader at PwC said, is the interconnectedness of the
industry's tools. "Utilities want to be able to get information out of
\[their\] systems to more efficiently operate them, and also share that
information with customers so they have more real-time information into
their usage," he explained. While allowing access to their own
consumption data allows the companies to give their customers more of
what they want, it also opens up a host of access points for hackers,
making the systems more vulnerable than they otherwise would be. But
[[to say]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} power [grid is susceptible to
cyber]{.mark} hackers [is]{.mark} a bit of an
**[oversimplification]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Cyberwar stabilizing\-\--forestalls escalation

**Lonergan '22** \[Erica; April 15; assistant professor in the Army
Cyber Institute and a research scholar at the Saltzman Institute of War
and Peace Studies at Columbia University; Foreign Affairs, "The
Cyber-Escalation Fallacy,"
<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2022-04-15/cyber-escalation-fallacy>\]

[A third lesson of cyber-operations over the past decade is that U.S.
officials should **adopt a more flexible mindset in their response to
them.**]{.underline} Rather than focusing on retaliatory action, [the
United States should devote more resources to enhancing resilience---the
ability to absorb and rapidly]{.underline} [recover from disruptive
occurrences]{.underline}. [Embracing this type of approach means
accepting that cyberattacks are likely to take place]{.underline} and,
more important, that [the overwhelming majority of them will not have
cataclysmic effects]{.underline}. Over the past several years, the
United States has improved its resilience to such attacks, expanding the
agencies responsible for working with and maintaining critical
infrastructure, such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency. The U.S. government has also created the Office of the National
Cyber Director to harmonize its cybersecurity efforts and collaborate
with the private sector. But these entities are still relatively new,
and efforts to implement meaningful regulation of the private sector to
promote resilience still have a long way to go.

A CYBER ESCAPE VALVE?

Just because cyber-operations have not yet caused escalation does not
mean that they will never do so. If conflicts such as the war in Ukraine
lead to greater instability in the international system and increased
great-power competition, the risks of cyber-escalation may grow. The
opposite is also possible, however: in a more unstable world,
**[cyber-operations may provide an important outlet for recurring
tensions]{.underline}**, given their lack of physical violence and
relatively limited effects. [As international politics become more
dangerous, cyberspace can offer a way for states to respond to perceived
aggressions **without causing physical destruction or loss of life, thus
providing a kind of stability in itsel**]{.underline}f.

Ultimately, [escalation is in the eye of the beholder]{.underline}---it
depends as much on the target's perception of an event as on the
perpetrator's intent or the reality of the strategic context. Therefore,
a further priority of U.S. policymakers should be to improve their
understanding of how adversaries interpret Washington's activities in
cyberspace and leverage that knowledge to conduct cyber-operations that
minimize the risk of escalation. During a crisis, for instance, the
United States may want to avoid conducting cyber-operations in a manner
that an adversary might perceive as a precursor to conflict or to a
military strike, especially if that is not the intent. If there is a
pressing strategic or military imperative to conduct these types of
operations, they should occur in tandem with efforts to communicate
their purpose to avoid misunderstandings.

For too long, policymakers have drawn the wrong lessons from
cyber-operations. [The absence of escalation across decades of strategic
interaction in cyberspace---a record that has only been reinforced in
the conflict in Ukraine]{.underline}---[should cause policymakers to
reevaluate long-standing assumptions about the
cyber-domain.]{.underline} In doing so, they may be able to see how
[cyber-actions are but one of a number of strategic tools
that]{.underline}, properly understood, can limit the risk of conflict
as much as increase it. Of course, the potential for cyberattacks to
temporarily paralyze large information networks or even whole sectors of
an economy should not be discounted. But in a world in which armed
conflict continues to destroy entire cities and wreak terrible human
costs, both civilian and military, cyber-operations should be regarded
less as another form of hard power than as a way for states to pursue
strategic goals by other means.

#### Cyberattacks fail and have minimal chance of escalation\-\--Ukraine proves

**Mueller '22** \[John; March 22; Political Scientist at Ohio State
University and a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute; Foreign Affairs;
"The Cyber-Delusion,"
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2022-03-22/cyber-delusion\]

[When Russian forces launched their invasion of Ukraine last month,
governments]{.underline} and experts worldwide [warned about the danger
of]{.underline} **[catastrophic cyberattacks]{.underline}**. Indeed, [in
the days leading up]{.underline} to Moscow's invasion, [hackers defaced
Ukrainian websites, unleashed malware on]{.underline} government
systems, and targeted [the country's banking system---albeit with
**limited effect**]{.underline}. Although no cyber-Armageddon has
materialized, officials increasingly fear that Russia might eventually
step up its efforts and even target the United States.

[Russia's invasion is no doubt catastrophic]{.underline}. But in
reacting to it and preparing for what comes next, [leaders]{.underline}
in Washington and elsewhere [should eschew the **alarmism**]{.underline}
[that has long warped cybersecurity policy]{.underline}. Mike Mullen,
then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, claimed in 2011 that "the
single biggest existential threat out there, I think, is cyber." The
following year, his successor, Martin Dempsey, noted that "a cyberattack
could stop our society in its tracks." Former Defense Secretary Leon
Panetta sternly warned in 2012 of an impending "digital Pearl Harbor."
Nicole Perlroth, a cybersecurity reporter at The New York Times, has
routinely asked insiders when "a cyber-enabled cataclysmic boom will
take us down" and has always been told "18 to 24 months." She began her
survey well over 100 months ago.

[This contemporary approach to cyberthreats resembles the aftermath of
9/11, when almost all experts believed an even larger terrorist attack
would soon take place. Then, as now, **the threat is
overblown.**]{.underline} [Although occasionally dramatic, cyberattacks
have turned out to be a comparatively **minor and manageable
threat**.]{.underline} Far [too much discussion around the issue focuses
on **worst-case scenarios, fails to contextualize the
problem**]{.underline}, [and neglects to weigh the **costs** of
cyberattacks against the **enormous value of the Internet and artificial
intelligence**.]{.underline} [Most commentary, moreover, does not fully
appreciate the ability of the business sector]{.underline}---by far the
most tempting of targets for malevolent hackers---**[to develop
effective countermeasures]{.underline}**.

Over the past decade, the global obsession with digital threats has
taken various forms, with a particular focus on the potential military
implications of emerging cyber-capabilities. To be sure, the military
needs to worry about keeping its communications and command and control
operations secure from hostile attackers. Any disruptions, however, are
more likely to be instrumental or tactical than strategic.

Despite statements to the contrary, **[the U.S. military itself seems to
have recognized this]{.underline}** reality. When Panetta proclaimed in
2013 that cyber was "without question, the battlefield for the future,"
political scientist Micah Zenko observed at the time that [the Pentagon
was spending less than one percent of its budget on
cybersecurity]{.underline}, and an assessment [from 2019]{.underline}
suggests [it may be more like one-tenth of one percent]{.underline}. If
those funds prove adequate for the challenge, it would be something of a
bargain.

Cyber also supposedly enhances a state's ability to carry out such
ancient endeavors as espionage, propaganda dissemination, and sabotage.
Analysts have even coined a new term, "**[hybrid
warfare]{.underline}**," that usually includes these three
enterprises---although, since the term does not include direct armed
conflict, it [might more plausibly be called "denatured
warfare]{.underline}." Cyber's contribution to these three areas,
however, is relatively limited.

Should invading hackers engage in digital espionage against the United
States, for instance, they are likely to find that most of what they
come across is already well known, and that much of the rest is not
worth knowing in the first place. Wikileaks' 2010 publication of
thousands of classified U.S. government documents demonstrated the
degree to which governments worldwide have fallen victim to
over-classification. When Bill Keller, the editor in charge of poring
over the documents at The New York Times, was asked whether the
reporting team found anything they didn't already know, he responded
"no" without hesitation.

Much the same holds for concerns over the theft of intellectual
property. Not only is this practice centuries old, but systematic
stealing has often proved unwise because it distracts governments from
homegrown innovation. Cyber-propaganda efforts, in turn, are more likely
to increase the overall amount of available information and
disinformation---an age-old problem in warfare---than to provide a
decisive advantage.

[The achievements of cyber-sabotage have also been quite
modest]{.underline}. The United States and Israel famously used a
computer virus known as [Stuxnet]{.underline} to hamper Iran's progress
toward developing a nuclear weapon. Although observers
[hailed]{.underline} the operation [as]{.underline} a
[dangerous]{.underline} new development in modern conflict, the damage
[proved temporary. Iran quickly rebuilt its centrifuges]{.underline},
and the attack actually proved counterproductive, as it encouraged
Tehran to accelerate its nuclear program. There have also been efforts
by the United States to physically interfere with missile development in
North Korea. Yet, much like the Iranians, Pyongyang eventually solved
whatever the problem was, and the attacks had little long-term effect on
their program.

[Cyber-alarmists have also warned about hackers disabling major
infrastructure]{.underline} such as power grids---potentially crippling
entire countries. [Grids do go down occasionally, but the culprits are
typically squirrels and lightning]{.underline}. Regardless of the
source, [such]{.underline} disruptions **[are usually brief and
bearable]{.underline}**, [and engineers are increasingly designing
systems that are resilient to such threats]{.underline}. Estonia, for
instance, the victim of a major and oft-discussed cyberattack in 2007,
is now the home of NATO's Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of
Excellence.

#### [Squo solves]{.underline} NATO cyber clarity

Khatuna **Burkadze 18**, PhD, a Fulbright scholar at the MIT Center of
International Studies, a visiting researcher at Columbia University,
Bard College and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, graduate of

the Cyber Era?" The Fletcher Forum of World Affairs, Volume 42, Issue 2,
Summer 2018, 215-226

NATO\'S CYBER DEFENSE AND INTERNATIONAL LAW The U.N. Charter and the
North Atlantic Treaty (the founding treaty of NATO) were adopted in 1945
and 1949 when the creation of cyberspace was a matter of the future
rather than a consideration of the times. Currently, it is clear that
information and communication technologies have transformed the nature
of war and changed historical understanding of armed attacks.
Traditional applications of the use of force prohibition fail to
adequately safeguard shared community values threatened by Computer
NetworkAttacks (CNA).\" The use of force is strictly limited in
international law according to the U.N. Charter. Consequently, the
central questions are the following: [Could a cyberattack be equated to
an armed attack according to international law? If a cyberattack equates
to an armed attack, how should the principle of collective defense of
NATO be interpreted to give member states legal guidance on the concept
of a cyberattack? [Do we need]{.mark} amendments in [Article 5]{.mark}
of the North Atlantic Treaty [to clearly define what constitutes a
cyberattack?]{.mark} Answers to these questions can provide insights for
defining rules of cyber operations in case of cyberattacks.]{.underline}
The definitions of the use of force and armed attack are not provided in
the U.N. Charter. In this regard, in its argument on a case concerning
Nicaragua, the International Court of Justice rejected a narrow
interpretation of \"use of force\" that limits the term to the
employment of either kinetic force or non-kinetic operations generating
comparable effects. The Court held that a state\'s arming and training
of guerrilla forces engaged in hostilities against another state
qualified as a use of force, a position that has since become widely
accepted.\'\" The logic of the holding leads to the conclusion that
non-destructive cyber operations may amount to a use of force. For
example, providing malware to a rebel group and training its members to
employ that malware in a destructive manner would seemingly qualify.20
However, every unfriendly act does not cross the use of force threshold.
The International Court of Justice held that financing guerrillas,
albeit an unlawful \"intervention,\" did not fall into the same
category. Therefore, cyber operations intended to economically coerce
another state to engage in, or desist from, a particular course of
action would not amount to a use of force; nor would financing a rebel
group\'s cyber operations. Beyond these directly parallel examples,
uncertainty remains as to where the threshold lies.2 1 [The NATO
Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence launched a major research
project in late 2009 to examine the public international law governing
cyber warfare]{.underline}2 2 [and cyber operations, resulting in [the
**Tallinn Manual**]{.mark} 1.0 and Tallinn Manual 2.0. These two
documents [provide]{.mark} international [**experts\' analysis**
on]{.mark} how existing international law applies to cyber warfare and
cyber operations.]{.underline} Through Tallinn Manual 1.0, [the
International Group of Experts developed a nonexclusive list of
[**factors** that]{.mark} would likely [influence]{.mark} the
[**characterization** of **cyber op**]{.mark}eration**[s]{.mark}** by a
state as a use of force: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness,
measurability, military character, state involvement, and presumptive
legality. Additional factors found meaningful by the Experts included,
inter alia, the prevailing political environment, the nexus of an
operation to prospective military force, the attacker\'s identity, the
attacker\'s track record with respect to cyber operations, and the
nature of the target. These and other factors operate [in concert as
states make **case-by-case determinations**.]{.mark} Of them, severity
alone can qualify a cyber operation as a use of force.]{.underline}23 In
this regard, the Group unanimously agreed that any cyber operation
causing greater than de minimis damage or injury suffices. For instance,
they concurred that the damage to Iranian nuclear facilities in 2010
resulting from the Stuxnet virus crossed the threshold.24 As for the
concept of cyberattacks and cyberwarfare, there are no widely accepted
definitions. The U.S. Department of Defense defines \"computer network
attacks\" as \"actions taken by using computer networks to disrupt,
deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer
networks, or the computers and networks themselves.\"2 5 Yale Law
Professor Oona Hathaway and her colleagues have devised a broader
definition of a \"cyberattack.\" In a 2012 article, they wrote: \"A
cyberattack consists of any action taken to undermine the functions of a
computer network for a political or national security purpose.\" The
article goes on to say that \"any action\" includes \"hacking, bombing,
cutting, inflecting, and so forth,\" as long as the action has the
objective of undermining or disrupting a computer network. The word
\"purpose\" seems to apply to the intent of the attacking party.26
According to the Tallinn Manual\'s Rule 30. \"A cyberattack is a cyber
operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected
to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to
objects.\"27 In this regard, Professor Antonia Chayes, in an article
titled, \"Rethinking Warfare: The Ambiguity of Cyber Attacks,\"
highlights that a cyber operation can constitute an attack even before
the damaging consequences of such an operation become evident, citing
the example of implanting malware that will be activated at a later
time, but for which the intended consequences meet the requisite
threshold of harm as an event that could be defined as an attack
\"irrespective of whether the malware is activated\" this is a direct
parallel to implanting. In a similar vein, a cyberattack that has been
launched but defeated still amounts to an attack. The Manual does warn
that great care should be exercised when identifying the perpetrator of
the attack.28 Professor Chayes emphasizes that these [**definitional
iterations** help to refine the issues, although they **cannot** be
expected to **answer all questions.** They]{.underline} do [serve to
narrow differences in approach somewhat and to begin to assure that
officials are addressing common issues. **However**, the **[lack
of]{.mark} internationally [accepted distinctions]{.mark}** among
\"cybercrime,\" \"cyberattack,\" and \"cyber war\" [make]{.mark}
concerted international [action]{.mark} more **[difficult]{.mark} to
achieve**]{.underline}. [The [definitions alone **do not
delineate**]{.mark} civilian and military [roles]{.mark}, nor do they
[designate a legal framework]{.mark} under which to operate, since the
issue of whether an attack warrants a military response-even in the
military domain-remains ambiguous.]{.underline} Economic attacks may be
handled through a variety of international means, judicial and
diplomatic. But crippling economic attacks without serious casualties
might not be sufficient to warrant acts in selfdefense under Article 51
of the U.N. Charter nor, as in the case of Estonia, a collective
response under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. [As for
[NATO\'s]{.mark} official [position]{.mark} on interconnection between
the existing international legal regulations and cyberspace, the Wales
Summit Declaration]{.underline} (issued by the Allies in Wales on 4-5
September 2014) [emphasizes]{.underline}: \"Our policy recognizes that
international law, including international humanitarian law and the U.N.
Charter, applies in cyberspace. Cyberattacks can reach a threshold that
threatens national and Euro-Atlantic prosperity, security, and
stability. Their impact could be as harmful to modern societies as a
conventional attack. [We affirm therefore that cyber defense is part of
NATO\'s core task of collective defense. A decision as to when a
cyberattack would lead to the invocation of Article 5 would be
[taken]{.mark} by the North Atlantic Council [on a **case-by-case
basis**]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}30 [This means that]{.underline}, on the
one hand, member states of the Alliance agreed that international law
applies to cyberspace but, on the other hand, in the case of a
cyberattack, [a decision about invoking Article 5 will be made by the
members of NATO based on the particular criteria. Therefore, the
principle of collective defense is not an automatic mechanism. [The
exact criteria]{.mark} by which cyber incidents may trigger an Article 5
invocation of collective defense [have not been determined. **However**,
the **N**]{.mark}orth **[A]{.mark}**tlantic **[C]{.mark}**ouncil [is
**very likely** to consider]{.mark} the following elements in its
deliberations.]{.underline} \" **[[Scope]{.underline}]{.mark}**: Is the
incident widespread across a geographic area or industrial sectors? The
wider the attack is, the more likely NATO action will be; \"
**[[Duration]{.underline}]{.mark}**: Is the incident a single event or
does it last over time as part of a longer campaign? NATO is more likely
to act for extended incidents; \"
[Intensity/**[Scale]{.mark}**]{.underline}: Has the incident caused
death or substantial property destruction? If not, NATO is unlikely to
declare collective defense; \" [External
**[Actor]{.mark}**]{.underline}: Is the incident directed from a foreign
or domestic adversary? NATO is unlikely to act against a purely domestic
foe.31

Now [imagine the response of that ally when it's being asked to take
causus belli on faith: The **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [is presenting attribution for a cyberattack
elsewhere in the world, but perhaps is depending on the ally lacking
critical details due to classification, and is presenting that
information alongside a request for help that might well put the ally in
the crosshairs of its own cyberattack or lethal action. How can allies
with different capabilities to collect, analyze and understand
intelligence be part of a consensus on using sovereign cyber effects to
support a NATO operation]{.underline}? How can a commander achieve a
common operational picture to authorize the use of sovereign effects in
a NATO operation if all the allies are not on the same page with respect
to critical attribution and other technical information needed for a use
of effect in an operation? [We all know what a tank looks like on a
shared satellite image, but if you ask three cyber experts to interpret
the attribution for a set of indicators, you are likely to get at least
four answers.]{.underline}

[[For]{.mark} most U.S. [allies]{.mark} in Europe and elsewhere, [there
is]{.mark} simply [a **dearth** of **tech**]{.mark}**nical
[know-how]{.mark}** within the government [when it comes to]{.mark}
cyber [**attribution** and **op**]{.mark}**eration[s]{.mark}**. This is
**already a challenge** for the United States, with a massive defense

[private sector]{.mark}]{.underline}, nongovernmental organizations
[(NGOs) and academia before reaching ministerial positions]{.underline}.

To its credit, the U.S. National Cyber Strategy does propose
capacity-building measures to support allies. This means building up law
enforcement, intelligence, and military operational and investigative
capability. But even with successful capacity-building programs, many
nations could, in a crisis, end up in the same place the United States
is---with good options stuck on the shelf while political leaders and
their electorates lack a critical mass of informed voters to trust,
understand and act on expert findings.

[For countries weighing whether to risk their own blood and treasure in

no doubt [**recall** being burned]{.mark} when placing too much

Strategic and International Studies; \"Dismissing Cyber Catastrophe,\"
https://www.csis.org/analysis/dismissing-cyber-catastrophe\]

A catastrophic cyberattack was first predicted in the mid-1990s. Since
then, [predictions of a catastrophe have appeared regularly]{.underline}
and have entered the popular consciousness. [As a **trope**, a cyber
catastrophe captures our]{.underline} [**imagination**, but]{.underline}
as analysis, [it remains **entirely imaginary**]{.underline} [and is of
**dubious value**]{.underline} [as a basis for policymaking. **There has
never been a catastrophic cyberattack**]{.underline}.

[To qualify as a catastrophe, an event must produce damaging mass
effect,]{.underline} including casualties and destruction. The fires
that swept across California last summer were a catastrophe. Covid-19
has been a catastrophe, especially in countries with inadequate
responses. With man-made actions, however, [a [catastrophe is
**hard**]{.mark}**er [to produce]{.mark}** than it may seem, and for
[cyberattacks]{.mark} a catastrophe [requires]{.mark} **organizational**
and]{.underline} **[technical]{.underline}** [[skills most]{.mark}
actors still [do not possess. It requires **planning**]{.mark},
**reconnaissance** to find **vulnerabilities**, [and]{.mark} then
**[acquiring]{.mark}** or building **attack
[tools]{.mark}**]{.underline}---things that require resources and
experience. [To achieve **mass effect**, either a few [central
targets]{.mark}]{.underline} (like an electrical grid) [[need to be hit
or multiple]{.mark} targets]{.underline} would have to be [[hit
**simultaneously**]{.underline}]{.mark} (as is the case with urban water
systems), [something that is itself an **operational
challenge**]{.underline}.

[It is easier to **imagine**]{.underline} [a catastrophe than to produce
it. [The 2003]{.mark} East Coast [blackout is the archetype]{.mark} for
an attack]{.underline} on the U.S. electrical grid. [[No one
died]{.mark} in this blackout, and **[services were restored]{.mark}**
in a few days]{.underline}. As electric production is digitized,
vulnerability increases, but [many **electrical
[companies]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[have made
**cyber**]{.mark}**security**]{.underline} [[a
priority]{.underline}]{.mark}. Similarly, [at **water
treatment**]{.underline} [plants, the chemicals used to **purify
water**]{.underline} [are controlled in ways that make mass releases
difficult]{.underline}. In any case, [it would take a]{.underline}
**[massive amount]{.underline}** [of chemicals to]{.underline}
**[poison]{.underline}** [large **rivers** or]{.underline} [**lakes**,
more than most companies keep on hand, and any release
would]{.underline} **[quickly]{.underline}** [be]{.underline}
**[diluted]{.underline}**.

More importantly, [there are powerful]{.underline} **[strategic
constraints]{.underline}** [on those who have]{.underline} the [ability
to launch **catastrophe attacks**. We have more]{.underline} than two
[decades of experience with the use of]{.underline} **[cyber
techniques]{.underline}** and operations for coercive and criminal
purposes [and have a]{.underline} **[clear understanding]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} [**motives**, **capabilities**, and
**intentions**]{.underline}. We can be guided by the methods of the
Strategic Bombing Survey, which used interviews and observation (rather
than hypotheses) to determine effect. These methods apply equally to
cyberattacks. The conclusions we can draw from this are:

[[**Nonstate actors** and]{.mark} **most [states]{.mark}** [lack]{.mark}
the [capability to]{.mark} launch attacks that [cause]{.mark} **physical
[damage]{.mark} at any level, [much less]{.mark} a
[catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [There have been regular
predictions every year]{.underline} for over a decade [that nonstate
actors will acquire these]{.underline} high-end cyber capabilities [in
two or three years]{.underline} in what has become a cycle of
repetition. [The monetary]{.underline} [**return is negligible**, which
**dissuades** the skilled cybercriminals]{.underline} (mostly Russian
speaking) [who might have the necessary skills]{.underline}. One mystery
is why these groups have not been used as mercenaries, and this may
reflect either a degree of control by the Russian state (if it has
forbidden mercenary acts) or a degree of caution by criminals.

[[There is **enough uncertainty**]{.mark} among potential attackers
[about]{.mark} the **U**nited **S**tates' [ability to
**attribute**]{.mark}]{.underline} [that [they are]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[unwilling to risk]{.mark} massive [retaliation]{.mark}** in
response]{.underline} to a catastrophic attack. (They are perfectly
willing to take the risk of attribution for espionage and coercive cyber
actions.)

[[No one has]{.mark} ever [died from]{.mark} a [cyber]{.mark}attack, and
only a handful]{.underline} of these attacks have [produced physical
damage. A cyberattack is not a nuclear weapon, and [it is]{.mark}
**intellectually [lazy]{.mark}** [to equate them to nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. Using a tactical nuclear weapon against
an urban center would produce several hundred thousand casualties, while
a strategic nuclear exchange would cause tens of millions of casualties
and immense physical destruction. These are catastrophes that some hack
cannot duplicate. [The shadow of **nuclear war distorts discussion** of
cyber warfare]{.underline}.

[State use of cyber operations is consistent with their broad national
strategies and interests. Their **primary emphasis** is on]{.underline}
**[espionage]{.underline}** [and political]{.underline} [**coercion**.
The **U**nited **S**tates has **[opponents]{.mark}** and is in
**conflict** with them, but they [have **no interest** in]{.mark}
launching **a [catastrophic]{.mark} cyber[attack]{.mark}** since [it
would]{.mark} **certainly** [produce]{.mark} **an [equal]{.mark}ly
catastrophic [retaliation]{.mark}**. Their goal is to stay below the
"use-of-force" threshold]{.underline} and undertake damaging cyber
actions against the United States, [not start a war]{.underline}.

[This has implications]{.underline} for the discussion of
[**[inadvertent escalation]{.mark}**, something that has
also]{.underline} **[[never occurred]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The concern
over escalation deserves a longer discussion, as [there are both
**technological** and **strategic** **[constraints]{.mark}** that shape
and **[limit risk]{.mark} in cyber operations**, and **the
[absence]{.mark} of inadvertent escalation** [suggests]{.mark} **a high
degree of [control]{.mark}** for cyber capabilities [by **advanced
states**]{.mark}. Attackers, particularly among the **U**nited
**S**tates' major **opponents**]{.underline} [for whom cyber is just one
of the tools for confrontation, seek to **avoid actions** that could
**trigger escalation**]{.underline}.

[The **U**nited **S**tates has two opponents (**China** and **Russia**)
who are capable of damaging cyberattacks.]{.underline} Russia has
demonstrated its attack skills on the Ukrainian power grid, [but
[neither **Russia**]{.mark} **nor [China]{.mark}** [would]{.mark} be
**well served** by a]{.underline} similar [[attack]{.mark} on the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates. **[Iran]{.mark}**]{.underline}
is improving and [may reach the point where it [could]{.mark} use
cyberattacks]{.underline} to cause major damage, [[but]{.mark} it would
**[only]{.mark}** do so [when]{.mark} it has **decided** to **engage**
[in]{.mark} a]{.underline} [**major [armed conflict]{.mark}** with the
**U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}. Iran might attack targets outside
the United States and its allies with less risk and continues to
experiment with cyberattacks against Israeli critical infrastructure.
[[**North Korea** has **no**]{.mark}**t**]{.underline} yet [developed
this kind of [capability]{.mark}]{.underline}.

One major failing of catastrophe scenarios is that they discount the
robustness and resilience of modern economies. These [[economies]{.mark}
present multiple targets and configurations; they [are hard]{.mark}er
[to damage through cyberattack]{.mark} than they look, [given]{.mark}
the [growing]{.mark}]{.underline} (albeit incomplete)
[**[attention]{.mark}** to cybersecurity; and [**experience**
shows]{.mark} that [people]{.mark} **compensate** for damage and
**quickly [repair]{.mark}** or **rebuild**]{.underline}. This was one of
the counterintuitive lessons of the Strategic Bombing Survey. [Pre-war
[planning **assumed**]{.mark} that **civilian [morale]{.mark} and
production** [would **crumple**]{.mark}]{.underline} under aerial

**[restored]{.mark}**]{.underline}.1

This is a short overview of why [[catastrophe is
**unlikely**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Several longer CSIS reports go into
the reasons in some detail. Past performance may not necessarily predict
the future, but [[after **25 years** without **a**]{.mark} **single
[catastrophic]{.mark} cyber[attack]{.mark}**, we should invoke the
concept cautiously, if at all]{.underline}. Why then, it is raised so
often?

Some of the explanation for the emphasis on cyber catastrophe is
hortatory. When [the author of one of the first reports]{.underline} (in
the 1990s) to sound the alarm over cyber catastrophe was asked later why
he had warned of a cyber Pearl Harbor when it was clear this was not
going to happen, his reply was that he [hoped to **scare people** into
action. [\"Catastrophe]{.mark} is nigh; we must act\" [was]{.mark}
**possibly a [reasonable]{.mark}**]{.underline} strategy [[22 years
ago]{.mark}, but **[no longer]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The resilience of historical events to remain culturally significant
must be taken into account for an objective assessment of cyber warfare,
and this will require the United States to discard some hypothetical
scenarios. [**The long [experience]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **living
under** [the **shadow** of **nuc**]{.mark}**lear [annihilation]{.mark}**
still **shapes** American **thinking** [and]{.mark} **conditions** the
**U**nited **S**tates to **expect extreme** outcomes. American thinking
is also shaped by]{.underline} the experience of
**[[9/11]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a wrenching attack that caught the
United States by surprise. [[Fears]{.mark} of another]{.underline} 9/11
[[reinforce]{.mark} the memory of nuclear war in driving [the
**catastrophe trope**]{.mark}, but when applied to cyberattack, [these
scenarios **do not track** with]{.mark} **[operation]{.mark}al
requirement[s]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} the nature of [opponent]{.mark}
**strategy and [planning]{.mark}**. The contours of **cyber warfare**
are emerging, but]{.underline} they [are not always what we discuss.
Better **policy** will require greater **objectivity**]{.underline}.

Between 4 and 7 September 2001, I attended the First Biennial Threat
Reduction Conference that was sponsored by the Defense Threat Reduction
Agency in Norfolk, Virginia. One of the panels featured a debate about
the likelihood of mass casualty terrorism in the United States. One
panelist asserted that such an event was unlikely---the Aum Shinrikyo
sarin attack being a case in point. Although well-funded and left
relatively unmolested by the authorities, cultists managed to kill only
13 people when they released a nerve agent in the Tokyo subway. Thus,
[inflicting mass casualties]{.underline}, even with sarin, [was not
easily accomplished]{.underline}. The threat of mass casualty terrorism
was being exaggerated by scholars and pundits alike, the panelist
asserted, urging the conferees to instead focus on plausible threats.
The other panelist agreed that Aum Shinrikyo was inept but offered the
obvious counterpoint: just because something has not occurred in the
past does not guarantee that it will not occur in the future. The next
morning, I contemplated this wonderfully "academic" debate on a pleasant
United Airlines flight from Dulles to San Francisco. Soon afterwards it
occurred to me that when it comes to picking an itinerary or making
observations about the future, timing is everything. DOUBTING THE THREAT
HYPE Brandon Valeriano and Ryan Maness acknowledge the "timing" problem
inherent in their well-reasoned and empirically based assessment of
state cyber conflicts that occurred between 2001 and 2011. Nevertheless,
in their view, [cyber war is **mostly hype**, created by
**over-imaginative academics** and **a cyber security industry ready to
profit** from cyber anxieties]{.underline}. By contrast, [their analysis
reveals]{.underline} that, at least in the period considered, [cyber
conflict was limited in **both scope and severity**, and]{.underline}
was largely [characterized by]{.underline} espionage or
[hooliganism]{.underline} (defacement of government websites) [that
**generally produced no lasting impact**]{.underline}. They note that
[in the vast majority of cases]{.underline} the
[incompetence]{.underline} of the victim or the aid of a witting or
unwitting accomplice had [facilitated penetration]{.underline} of some
system. Here the 2015 hack of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management,
which compromised the personal information of just about everyone who
had ever applied for or possessed a U.S. security clearance, comes to
mind. The Stuxnet attack against Iranian centrifuges, an outlier in
their database, is used to illustrate their fundamental point: that [the
use of cyber warfare to inflict real damage is **a rare** and
**extraordinarily difficult endeavor**]{.underline} that is probably
within the technical reach of only a few states. Valeriano and Maness
also back up their empirical observations with some theoretical musings
about why the reality of cyber warfare is out of step with the cyber
hype surrounding the issue. [Zero-day exploits]{.underline} (using
heretofore unknown system vulnerabilities) [are **fleeting in their
efficacy**; once revealed, they are quickly rectified]{.underline}.
Because they begin to lose their effectiveness soon after they are
employed, the tendency is to keep one's powder dry, so to speak.
Moreover, [aggressive viruses can]{.underline} either propagate
uncontrollably across the Internet or [be **repackaged** and **returned
to the sender with unpredictable consequences**. Because predicting the
impact of more aggressive cyber attacks is difficult,
states]{.underline} tend to [exhibit **restraint in their use of cyber
weapons**]{.underline}. Put somewhat differently, [weapons
that]{.underline} are likely to [produce collateral damage or even
fratricide are **not readily embraced by military
professionals**]{.underline}. Although the authors do not mention it,
attitudes toward the use of cyber weapons seem to mirror the history of
biological warfare. Unleashing contagion is highly unpredictable;
weapons with unknowable effects have little military utility. They might
produce their intended impact, but there is no telling how far disease
might spread. Because the same can be said for cyber weapons, [restraint
characterizes]{.underline} the way states engage in [cyber
conflict]{.underline}. Another theoretical insight offered by Valeriano
and Maness is that cyber conflict is both profoundly political and
strategic. Conflict is centered on a set of enduring rivalries: India
and Pakistan, China and Japan, Russia and member states of the former
Soviet Union, the United States and China, and the United States and
Iran. With the exception of Stuxnet, these [incidents tend to be
limited]{.underline}, matching the ["short-of-war"]{.underline} levels
of acrimony present in these relationships. These observations are
important because some policymakers and scholars tend to focus on what
might happen in cyberspace, not why it might happen. For instance, it is
theoretically possible to temporarily bring down the power grid in the
United States, or to disrupt the stock market, or to cripple the banking
system, creating significant disruption or even loss of life. But in
focusing on these scenarios [observers fail to stipulate **the strategic
purpose** or **the political setting** that would motivate
the]{.underline} launch of a highly [devastating]{.underline} cyber
[attack]{.underline}. Admittedly, for those on the front lines of cyber
defense, it might appear that the world has descended into a feral state
of nature as they monitor thousands of attempts daily to hack into
protected networks. Nevertheless, Valeriano and Maness correctly note
that [no one has yet died in a cyber attack]{.underline}, a requirement
needed to turn an incident into a "war." In a political and strategic
sense, [the world has not yet witnessed cyber war]{.underline}.

Moderate and [measured takes]{.underline} on cyber security threats [are
swamped by the recent flood of research]{.underline} and policy
positions in the cyber research field [offering **hyperbolic
perspectives** based on limited observations. **This skewed perspective
suggests constant cyber disasters**]{.underline} that are confronting
humanity constantly. The general tone of the debate argues that cyber
war is already upon us and our future will only witness more cyber doom.
However, [these hyperbolic perspectives are being **countered by
empirical investigations** that produce the opposite]{.underline} of
what is to be expected. It is generally observed that limited cyber
engagements throughout the geopolitical system are the dominant form of
interaction. Our task here is to offer a different path forward. We
first posit what can be known about cyber security interactions with
data as well as what cannot. Where is the water\'s edge in cyber
security research? We then examine the known works in the field that
utilize data and evidence to examine cyber security processes. Finally,
we conclude with an offering of what types of studies need to be done in
the future to move the field forward, away from the prognostication and
generalizations so typical in the discourse in this constantly changing
and growing field. Keywords cyber conflict; cyber security; cyber
strategy; data collection; quantitative methods Full Text: 1. The
Challenge of Cyber Security Threat Data Beginning in 2014, various news
organizations began reporting on a particular cyber security firm, Norse
Corporation, and their active cyber threat map (Walker, 2015). Mashable
noted in 2016 that \"the global cyber war is raging on, and this
mesmerizing map shows just how serious it has become\" (Gallucci, 2016).
The map is dynamic, colorful, and gets the point across quickly, a
criterion for any decent visualization of data. As late of August 2017,
the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) tweeted out a link and photo of
the threat maps suggesting it represented ongoing cyber-attacks (DIA,
2017). Yet this map is not a very clear representation of any real
threats that nationstates face on a daily basis. Unfortunately, the
Norse cyber threat map does not represent active threat data, but
attacks, likely by bots, on preset honeypots. Honeypots are a method of
providing data on fake targets to either distract the opposition from
the real targets or to deter an aggressor from attacking in the first
place (Gartzke & Lindsay, 2015). While sometimes a useful method to
gather threat intelligence if presented a sleight of hand for an
attractive target, honeypots as reported in popular discourse are not
exactly an accurate representation of the cyber threat landscape. In
this case, the goal was to demonstrate the ability to track global
attacks to gain interest in the company and promote its capabilities.
[Nearly all active threat maps either present data tracking honeypots
and various bot networks that are devoid of human agency]{.underline},
simply [presenting **what is in fact fake data**]{.underline}. Active
representation of the threat landscape is the goal, but the reality is
that the picture of the cyber security threat landscape we currently
have is incomplete, misleading, or outright fake. High profile data
breaches have been consuming media narratives for at least a decade.
With each act of cyber disruption or espionage, pundits as well as
government officials and several academics declare that cyberwar-fare is
upon us, is the future of warfare, and it is only a matter of time
before a \"Cyber Pearl Harbor\" wreaks havoc on the American homeland
(Gurdus, 2016). With this new revolution in military affairs, the
battlefield, according to some, is forever changed and the next big war
could very well be a cyberwar (Clarke & Knake, 2010; Kello, 2013).
[**Politicians**, **pundits**, and **practitioners**]{.underline} have
[jumped on **this doomsday narrative**]{.underline} and have promoted
cyber arms races, offensive advantage, and deterrence strategies to stay
one step ahead of would be adversaries in order to prevent them from
infiltrating networks out of fear of massive retaliation. These
revolutionists point to acts such as Stuxnet, Shamoon, Sony, and the
Office of Personal Management (OPM) hack as the new norm of conflict
between states, and that the US is losing ground with every tolerated
cyber-attack on American networks.

#### Data shows a tendency toward restraint.

6\. Expanding Cyber Security Data [Our team has been coding]{.underline}
cyber incident [data since 2010]{.underline} and serves as a unique
example of how the process of collecting cyber security data and
evidence can be done. Our first peer reviewed published work appeared in
2014 in Journal of Peace Research (Valeriano & Maness, 2014). In this
article we note that [cyber conflict is **much more restrained** than
generally understood]{.underline} by popular discourse. [Threat
inflation is **ripe in cyber security**]{.underline}, and the real use
of cyber tools seems to be to enhance the power of strong states. The
data that Valeriano and Maness (2014, 2015) have built challenges the
cyber revolution perspective and does so with the tools of social
science, and is a necessary turn given the general tone of the debate.
We first determine that a viable data collection method in light of
limited resources was to focus on states that are committed interstate
rivals (Diehl & Goertz, 2001). This allows us to focus on those actors
with an intense history of recent hostilities that should be the most
likely users of cyber technology on the battlefield (Maness & Valeriano,
2018). In our research (Maness & Valeriano, 2016; Maness, Valeriano, &
Jensen, 2017; Valeriano & Maness, 2014, 2015), we have been able to
marshal a massive amount of evidence that is useful in dissecting the
actual trends on the cyber battlefield in a geopolitical context. We
demonstrate that while [cyber-attacks are increasing in frequency, they
are limited **in severity**]{.underline}, are [**directly connected** to
**traditional territorial disagreements**, and]{.underline} mostly [take
the shape of **espionage and low-level disruptive campaigns** rather
than **outright warfare**]{.underline}. Given this data-based
perspective, we question the dynamics of the cyber security debate and
offer a countering theory where [states are restrained from using more

Conclusion

Amid deep conflict over basic norms, Egypt and the GCC states have
maneuvered between two poles while enjoying the tacit, if not explicit,
support of both sides. This has three key implications. First, global
cyber norms are much more complex --- and much more entangled with
traditional governance practices, diplomatic relationships, and
strategic concerns --- than Western officials may like to admit. However
uncomfortable it may be, [international policymaking on cyber norms must
take into account]{.underline} not only the "likemindedness" of some
states, but also [the fact of]{.underline} their [strategic
interests]{.underline} and relationships [with]{.underline} other
[[states]{.mark} that [are]{.mark}]{.underline} less or [**[not]{.mark}
at all [likeminded]{.mark}**. Without this recognition, [**any attempt**
to create]{.mark} global [cyber norms is **hampered**]{.mark} **from the
start**]{.underline}. More broadly, [to understand the **complexity** of
cyber norms we must **look outside** the framework of **great power**
competition]{.underline}.

Second, the United States and European allies of Egypt and the Gulf
states need to decide where their priorities lie: [[Does
consistency]{.mark} on global cyber norms **[outweigh]{.mark}** broader
[**security** considerations?]{.mark}]{.underline} If a stable, coherent
set of cyber norms is the primary aim, greater attention should be given
to persuading friendly states to stay within the boundaries of these
norms. However, if [[security]{.mark} alliances [**trump** cyber
norms]{.mark}]{.underline}, Western democracies should recognize that
[the [**rhetorical effect** of denouncing **Russia**]{.mark}n or Chinese
action [will be **limited**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For the United States,
effective foreign policy regarding cyber security in the Middle East
requires both the identification of a clear national interest, connected
to broader strategic goals concerning the kind of cyber space the United
States seeks to promote, and a good understanding of the evolving
landscape in which the U.S. government and U.S. companies are operating.
Right now, both are lacking.

Third, although the contradictions outlined here suggest that human
rights and national security are important starting points for research,
we should not confine cyber security research on these states to these
well-trodden paths. In the Middle East, cyber security is changing
regional alliances, altering the economic calculations of businesses,
and reforging fundamental relationships between individuals and their
governments. [[There are **significant differences** in]{.mark} cyber
security [approaches between]{.mark}]{.underline} these
[[states]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially in Kuwait and Qatar. And there
are many new initiatives and organizations, like Saudi Arabia's National
Cyber Security Authority (al-hai'a al-watniyya lil-'amn al-sibrani),
Egypt's High Council for Cybersecurity, the UAE's National Electronic
Security Agency, and Oman's Arab Region Cybersecurity Centre. As our
understanding of cyber security evolves and its connection to other
areas of foreign policy deepens, a broader approach to cyber security
research in this region is urgently needed to adequately understand
these new dynamics and inform future policy choices.

[[It is]{.underline}]{.mark} of course [**[highly unlikely]{.mark}**
that [either]{.mark} the **[US]{.mark}**A [or Russia has plans --
or]{.mark} perhaps more importantly, the [desire --

nuclear **[c]{.mark}**]{.underline}ommand [[and
**c**]{.underline}]{.mark}ontrol [systems]{.underline} as a precursor to
some type of disarming first strike, but the perception that nuclear
forces and associated systems could be vulnerable or compromised is
persuasive. Or as Hayes (2015) puts it, "The risks of cyber disablement
entering into our nuclear forces are real". While [the [growing
possibility]{.mark} of "[cyber]{.mark} disablement" [should **not** be
**overstated** (notions of a]{.mark} "cyber-**[Pearl
Harbor]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (Panetta 2012) [or "cyber
9--11"]{.underline} (Charles 2013) [[have **done little** to help
understand]{.mark} the nature of the challenge]{.underline}),
cyberthreats are nevertheless an increasingly important component of the
contemporary US--Russia strategic context. This is particularly the case
when they are combined with other emerging military-technical
developments and programmes. The net result, especially given the
current downturn in US--Russian strategic relations, and the way cyber
is exacerbating the impact of other problematic strategic dynamics, is
that is seems highly unlikely that either the USA or Russia will make
the requisite moves to de-alert nuclear forces that the new cyber
challenges appear to necessitate, or for that matter to (re)embrace the
"deep nuclear cuts" agenda any time soon.

Assessing the options for arms control and enhancing mutual security

Given the new challenges presented by cyber to both US and Russian
nuclear forces and to US--Russia strategic stability, it is important to
consider what might be done to help mitigate and guard against these
threats, and thereby help minimise the risks of unintentional launches,
miscalculation, and accidents, and perhaps create the conditions for
greater stability, de-alerting, and further nuclear cuts. While there is
unlikely to be a panacea or "magic bullet" that will reduce the risk of
cyberattacks on US and Russian nuclear forces to zero -- be they
designed to launch nuclear weapons or compromise the systems that
support them -- there are a number of options that might be considered
and pursued in order to address these different types of threats and
vulnerabilities. None, of these however, will be easy.

The most obvious and immediate priority for both the USA and Russia is
working (potentially together) to harden and better protect nuclear
systems against possible cyberattack, intrusion, or cyber-induced
accidents. In fact, in October 2013 it was announced that Russian
nuclear command and control networks would be protected against cyber
incursion and attacks by "special units" of the Strategic Missile Forces
(Russia Today 2014). Other measures will include better network defences
and firewalls, more sophisticated cryptographic codes, upgraded and
better protected communications systems (including cables), extra
redundancy, and better training and screening for the practitioners that
operate these systems (see Ullman 2015). However, and while
comprehensive reviews are underway to assess the vulnerabilities of
current US and Russian nuclear systems to cyberattacks, it may well be
that US and Russian C2 infrastructure becomes more vulnerable to cyber
as it is modernised and old analogue systems are replaced with
increasingly hi-tech digital platforms. As a result, and while
[**[nuclear]{.mark}** weapons [and **c**]{.mark}ommand [and
**c**]{.mark}ontrol [infrastructure are]{.mark} likely to be [the **best
protected** of **all**]{.mark} computer systems, [and **"air
gapped"**]{.mark}]{.underline}14 [[from the]{.mark} wider
[Internet]{.mark}]{.underline} -- this does not mean they are
invulnerable or will continue to be secure in the future, particularly
as systems are modernised or become more complex (Fritz 2009). Or as
Peggy Morse, ICBM systems director at Boeing, put it, "while its old
it's very secure" (quoted in Reed 2012).

#### Cyber attacks can't undermine deterrence or touch NC3.

**Caylor '16** \[Matt, Feb, Command and Staff College, "THE CYBER THREAT
TO NUCLEAR DETERRENCE",
<http://warontherocks.com/2016/02/the-cyber-threat-to-nuclear-deterrence/>\]

[The [perception that cyber]{.mark} threats [will]{.mark}]{.underline}
ultimately [[undermine]{.mark} the]{.underline} relevance or
[effectiveness of nuclear [deterrence is **flawed**]{.mark}]{.underline}
in at least three keys areas. [First]{.underline} among these [is the
perception that nuclear weapons]{.underline} or their command and
control systems [are similar to a heavily defended corporate network.
The **critical error**]{.underline} in this analogy [is that there is an
expectation of IP-based availability that simply **does not exist** in
the case of American [nuclear weapons]{.mark} --- **they [are not
online]{.mark}**. Even with physical access, the proprietary nature
of]{.underline} their control system design and redundancy of the
National [Command and Control]{.underline} System (NCCS) [makes the
[possibility of]{.mark} successfully [implementing an exploit]{.mark}
against either a weapon or communications system **[incredibly
remote]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Also, [whereas the cyber domain is
characterized by significant levels of risk due to a combination
of]{.underline} bias toward [**automated safeguards** and the liability
of single human failures, nuclear weapon safety and surety are
predicated on [**balanced elements** of **stringent human interaction**
and **control**]{.mark}. From **two-person integrity** in physical
inspections and loading, to the **rigorous mechanisms** and
**authority** required for weapons release, [human beings serve as a
**multi-factor safeguard**]{.mark} while retaining the ultimate role to
protect the integrity of nuclear deterrence against cyber
threats]{.underline}. To a large degree, the potential vulnerabilities
caused by wireless communications and physical intrusions into areas
holding nuclear material are already mitigated via secure communications
that are not linked to the outside and multiple layers of physical
security systems. While there has been a great deal of publicity
surrounding the Y-12 break-in of 2012, the truth is that the three
people involved never got near any nuclear material or technology.
Without state-level resourcing in the billions of dollars, [the
[technical sophistication]{.mark} required to pursue a Stuxnet-like
attack against nuclear weapons is]{.underline} most likely [[beyond the
capability of **even**]{.mark} **the [most gifted group of
hackers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For all intents, [this [**excludes
terrorist organizations** and **cyber criminals**]{.mark} from the field
of threats]{.underline} and restricts it to those nations that already
possess nuclear weapons. [Nuclear-weapon states]{.underline}, however,
[have the full-spectrum cyber threat capability]{.underline} referenced
in the Defense Science Board report [and would most likely be influenced
by an understanding of the elements of classic nuclear deterrence
strategy]{.underline}. In the case of first strike, [[no cyber weapon
could]{.mark} be expected to [perform at a rate higher than any
conventional]{.mark} anti-nuclear [capability]{.mark}]{.underline}
(i.e., not 100 percent effective). [Therefore, an adversary's nuclear
threat would be **perceived to endure**, thereby **negating** and
[**dissuading** the effort]{.mark} to use and employ a cyber weapon
against an adversary's nuclear force]{.underline}. Additionally, just as
missile defense systems have been historically controversial due to
perceived destabilizing effects, it is reasonable to conclude that these
nuclear-weapon states would view the attempt to deploy a cyber
capability against their nuclear stockpiles from a similar perspective.
Finally, [the very existence of nuclear weapons is often enough to
**alter the risk analysis** of an adversary]{.underline}. With virtually
no chance of remote or unauthorized detonation (which would be the
desired results of a sabotage event), [the most probable cyber threat to
any nuclear stockpile is that of espionage. Attempted cyber
intrusions]{.underline} at the U.S. National Nuclear Security Agency
(NNSA) and its efforts to bolster cybersecurity initiatives [provide
clear evidence that this is already underway. However, theft of design
information or even more robust intelligence on the location of stored
nuclear weapons **cannot eliminate the potential destruction** that even
a handful of nuclear weapons can bring]{.underline} to an adversary.
[Knowledge alone, particularly the imperfect knowledge that cyber
espionage is likely to offer, is **incapable of drastically altering an
adversary's risk calculus**.]{.underline} In fact, [**quite the opposite
is true.** An adversary with greater understanding of the nuclear
capabilities of a rival is forced to consider courses of action to
**prevent escalation**]{.underline}, potentially [**increasing the
credibility** of a state's nuclear deterrence]{.underline}. Despite the
growing sophistication in cyber capabilities and the willingness to use
them for espionage or in concert with kinetic attack, the strategic
value of nuclear weapons has not been diminished. [The **[insulated
architecture]{.mark}** combined [with a **robust and redundant
command-and-control system** makes]{.mark} the existence of any viable
[cyber threat of exploitation **extremely low**]{.mark}. With the list
of capable adversaries limited by both funding and motivation, it is
**highly unlikely** that any nation will **possess**, or even **attempt
to develop**, a cyber weapon **sufficient to undermine the credibility
of nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. In both psychological and physical
terms, [the threat of the megabyte will never possess the ability to
overshadow the destructive force of the megaton]{.underline}. Although
the employment of cyberspace for military effect has brought new
challenges to the international community, the role of nuclear weapons
and their associated deterrence against open and unconstrained global
aggression are as relevant now as they were in the Cold War.

Problems, Prospects", p. 63-69\]

[Even if initial nuclear use did not quickly end the fighting, the
supposition of inexorable momentum in a developing
exchange]{.underline}, [with each side rushing to
overreaction]{.underline} amid confusion and uncertainty, [is
implausible.]{.underline} **[It fails to consider what the situation of
the decisionmakers would really be. [Neither side]{.mark} could [want
escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Both would be appalled at what was
going on. [**Both would be [desperately looking for signs]{.mark} that
the other was ready [to]{.mark} call a [halt]{.mark}.** Both,
[given]{.mark} the cap[acity for]{.mark} evasion or [concealment]{.mark}
which modem delivery platforms and vehicles can possess, could have in
reserve significant forces]{.underline} [invulnerable enough not to
entail use-or-lose pressures]{.underline}. (It may be more open to
question, as noted earlier, whether newer nuclearweapon possessors can
be immediately in that position; but it is within reach of any
substantial state with advanced technological capabilities, and
attaining it is certain to be a high priority in the development of
forces.) [As a result, [neither sid]{.mark}e can [have]{.mark} any
[predisposition]{.mark} to suppose]{.underline}, in an ambiguous
situation of fearful risk, [[that the right course]{.mark}]{.underline}
when in doubt [[is]{.mark} to go on copiously [launching
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. And **[[none of this analysis rests
on]{.mark} any [presumption of]{.mark} highly subtle or pre-concerted
[rationality]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The rationality required is plain.
[The argument is reinforced if we consider the possible reasoning of an
aggressor]{.underline} at a more dispassionate level. [Any substantial
nuclear armoury can inflict destruction outweighing any possible prize
that aggression could hope to seize]{.underline}. [A state attacking the
possessor of such an armoury must therefore be doing so]{.underline}
(once given that it cannot count upon destroying the armoury
pre-emptively) [on a judgement that the possessor would be found lacking
in the will to use it.]{.underline} If the attacked possessor used
nuclear weapons, whether first or in response to the aggressor\'s own
first use, this judgement would begin to look dangerously precarious.
There must be at least a substantial possibility of the aggressor
leaders\' concluding that their initial judgement had been
mistaken---that the risks were after all greater than whatever prize
they had been seeking, and that for their own country\'s , survival they
must call off the aggression. Deterrence planning such as that of NATO
was directed in the first place to preventing the initial misjudgement
and in the second, if it were nevertheless made, to compelling such a
reappraisal. The former aim had to have primacy, because it could not be
taken for granted that the latter was certain to work. [But there was no
ground for assuming in advance]{.underline}, for all possible scenarios,
[that the chance of its working must be negligible]{.underline}. [An
aggressor state would itself be at huge risk if nuclear war developed,
as its leaders would know]{.underline}. It may be argued that a policy
which abandons hope of physically defeating theznemy and simply hopes to
get him to desist is pure gamble, a matter of who blinks first; and that
the political and moral nature of most likely aggressors, almost ex
hypothesi, makes them the less likely to blink. One response to this is
to ask what is the alternative---it can only be surrender. But a more
positive and hopeful answer lies in the fact that [the criticism is
posed in a political vacuum. Real-life conflict would have a political
context]{.underline}. The context which concerned NATO during the cold
war, for example, was one of defending vital interests against a
postlated aggressor whose own vital interests would not be engaged, or
would be less engaged. [Certainty is not possible, but a clear asymmetry
of vital interest is a legitimate basis for expecting an asymmetry,
credible to both sides, of resolve in conflict]{.underline}. That places
upon statesmen, as page 23 has noted, the key task in deterrence of
building up in advance a clear and shared grasp of where limits lie.
That was plainly achieved in cold-war Europe. If vital interests have
been defined in a way that is dear, and also clearly not overlapping or
incompatible with those of the adversary, a credible basis has been laid
for the likelihood of greater resolve in resistance. It was also
sometimes suggested by critics that whatever might be indicated by
theoretical discussion of political will and interests, the military
environment of nuclear warfare---particularly difficulties of
communication and control---would drive escalation with overwhelming
probability to the limit. But it is obscure why matters should be
regarded as inevitably .so for every possible level and setting of
action. Even if the history of war suggested (as it scarcely does) that
military decision-makers are mostly apt to work on the principle \'When
in doubt, lash out\', the nuclear revolution creates an utterly new
situation. The pervasive reality, always plain to both sides during the
cold war, is \`If this goes on to the end, we are all ruined\'. Given
that inexorable escalation would mean catastrophe for both, it would be
perverse to suppose them permanently incapable of framing arrangements
which avoid it. As page 16 has noted, NATO gave its military commanders
no widespread delegated authority, in peace or war, to launch nuclear
weapons without specific political direction. Many types of weapon
moreover had physical safeguards such as PALs incorporated to reinforce
organizational ones. There were multiple communication and control
systems for passing information, orders, and prohibitions. Such systems
could not be totally guaranteed against disruption if at a fairly
intense level of strategic exchange---which was only one of many
possible levels of conflict--- an adversary judged it to be in his
interest to weaken political control. It was far from clear why he
necessarily should so judge. Even then, however, it remained possible to
operate on a general fail-safe presumption: no authorization, no use.
That was the basis on which NATO operated. If it is feared that the
arrangements which 1 a nuclear-weapon possessor has in place do not meet
such standards in some respects, the logical course is to continue to
improve them rather than to assume escalation to be certain and
uncontrollable, with all the enormous inferences that would have to flow
from such an assumption. The likelihood of escalation can never be 100
per cent, and never zero. Where between those two extremes it may lie
can never be precisely calculable in advance; and even were it so
calculable, it would not be uniquely fixed---it would stand to vary
hugely with circumstances. That there should be any risk at all of
escalation to widespread nuclear war must be deeply disturbing, and
decision-makers would always have to weigh it most anxiously. But a pair
of key truths about it need to be recognized. The first is that the risk
of escalation to large-scale nuclear war is inescapably present in any
significant armed conflict between nuclear-capable powers, whoever may
have started the conflict and whoever may first have used any particular
category of weapon. The initiator of the conflict will always have
physically available to him options for applying more force if he meets
effective resistance. If the risk of escalation, whatever its degree of
probability, is to be regarded as absolutely unacceptable, the necessary
inference is that a state attacked by a substantial nuclear power must
forgo military resistance. It must surrender, even if it has a nuclear
armoury of its own. But the companion truth is that, as page 47 has
noted, the risk of escalation is an inescapable burden also upon the
aggressor. The exploitation of that burden is the crucial route, if
conflict does break out, for managing it, to a tolerable outcome\--the
only route, indeed, intermediate between surrender and holocaust, and so
the necessary basis for deterrence beforehand. The working out of plans
to exploit escalation risk most effectively in deterring potential
aggression entails further and complex issues. It is for example plainly
desirable, wherever geography, politics, and available resources so
permit without triggering arms races, to make provisions and
dispositions that are likely to place the onus of making the bigger, and
more evidently dangerous steps in escalation upon the aggressor volib
wishes to maintain his attack, rather than upon the defender. (The
customary shorthand for this desirable posture used to be \'escalation
dominance\'.) These issues are not further discussed here. But
addressing them needs to start from acknowledgement that there are in
any event no certainties or absolutes available, no options guaranteed
to be risk-free and cost-free. Deterrence is not possible without
escalation risk; and its presence can point to no automatic policy
conclusion save for those who espouse outright pacifism and accept its
consequences. Accident and Miscalculation Ensuring the safety and
security of nuclear weapons plainly needs to be taken most seriously.
Detailed information is understandably not published, but such direct
evidence as there is suggests that it always has been so taken in every
possessor state, with the inevitable occasional failures to follow
strict procedures dealt with rigorously. Critics [have]{.underline}
nevertheless from time to time [argued that the possibility of
accident]{.underline} [involving nuclear weapons]{.underline} [is so
substantial that it must weigh]{.underline} heavily in the entire
evaluation of whether war-prevention structures entailing their
existence should be tolerated at all. [Two sorts of scenario are usually
in question. The first is that of a single grave event involving an
unintended nuclear explosion---]{.underline}a technical disaster at a
storage site, for example, Dr the accidental or unauthorized launch of a
delivery system with a live nuclear warhead. [The second is that of some
event]{.underline}---[perhaps such an explosion or launch]{.underline},
or some other mishap such as malfunction or [misinterpretation of radar
signals or computer systems]{.underline}---[initiating a sequence of
response and counter-response]{.underline} that culminated in a nuclear
exchange which no one had truly intended. [No event that is physically
possible can be said to be of absolutely zero probability]{.underline}
([just as at an opposite extreme **[it is absurd to
claim]{.mark},**]{.underline} as has been heard from distinguished
figures, **[[that nuclear]{.mark}-weapon [use can be guaranteed
to]{.mark} happen within some finite future span [despite not having
happened for]{.mark} over [sixty years]{.mark})]{.underline}**. But
human affairs cannot be managed to the standard of either zero or total
probability. We have to assess levels between those theoretical limits
and weigh their reality and implications against other factors, in
security planning as in everyday life. [[There have]{.mark} certainly
[been]{.mark}, across the decades since 1945, many known
[accidents]{.mark} involving nuclear weapons]{.underline}, [from
transporters skidding off roads to bomber aircraft crashing with or
accidentally dropping the weapons they carried]{.underline} (in past
days when such carriage was a frequent feature of readiness
arrangements\-\-\--it no longer is). A few of these accidents may have
released into the nearby environment highly toxic material.
[[None]{.mark}]{.underline} however has [[entailed]{.mark} a nuclear
[detonation]{.mark}. Some commentators suggest that this reflects
bizarrely good fortune]{.underline} amid such massive activity and
deployment over so many years. **[A more rational deduction from the
facts of this long experience would however be that the probability of
any accident triggering a nuclear explosion is extremely
low]{.underline}**. It might be further noted that [the [mechanisms
needed to set off]{.mark} such an explosion are [technically
demanding]{.mark}]{.underline}, and that in a large number of ways the
past sixty years have seen extensive improvements in safety arrangements
for both the design and the handling of weapons. It is undoubtedly
possible to see respects in which, after the cold war, some of the
factors bearing upon risk may be new or more adverse; but some are now
plainly less so. [The years which the world has come through entirely
without accidental or unauthorized detonation have included early
decades in which knowledge was sketchier, precautions were less
developed, and [weapon]{.mark} designs [were less]{.mark} ultra-[safe
than they]{.mark} later [became]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} as well
as substantial periods in which weapon numbers were larger, deployments
more widespread and diverse, movements more frequent, and several
aspects of doctrine and readiness arrangements more tense. [Similar
considerations apply to the hypothesis of nuclear war being mistakenly
triggered by false alarm. Critics again point to the]{.underline}
[fact,]{.underline} as it is understood, [of [numerous occasions when
initial steps in alert sequences]{.mark} for US nuclear forces [were
embarked upon]{.mark}]{.underline}, or at least called for, by,
indicators mistaken or misconstrued. **[In [none of these
instances]{.mark}]{.underline}**, it is accepted, **[[did]{.mark}
matters get at all near to [nuclear
launch]{.mark}\--extraordinary]{.underline}** [good fortune]{.underline}
again, [critics have suggested]{.underline}. [But the rival and more
logical inference from hundreds of events stretching over sixty years of
experience presents itself once more: that the probability of initial
misinterpretation leading far towards mistaken launch is
remote.]{.underline} [Precisely because any nuclear-weapon possessor
recognizes the vast gravity of any launch, release sequences have many
steps, and human decision is repeatedly interposed as well as capping
the sequences]{.underline}. [To convey that because a first step was
prompted the world somehow came close to accidental nuclear war is wild
hyperbole, rather like asserting, when a tennis champion has lost his
opening service game, that he was nearly beaten in straight
sets]{.underline}. [History anyway scarcely offers any ready example of
major war started by accident even before the nuclear revolution imposed
an order-of-magnitude increase in caution]{.underline}. [It was
occasionally conjectured that nuclear war might be triggered by the real
but accidental or unauthorized launch]{.underline} of a strategic
nuclear-weapon delivery system in the direction of a potential
adversary. [No such launch is known to have occurred in over sixty
years. The probability of it is therefore very low. But even if it did
happen, the further hypothesis of it initiating a general nuclear
exchange is far-fetched. It fails to consider the real situation of
decision-makers]{.underline} as pages 63-4 have brought out. [The notion
that cosmic holocaust might be mistakenly precipitated in this way

disreputable conclusion, we should at least consider the possibility
that **systematic features of the international system**]{.underline}
[have worked against their use.]{.underline} Many antinuclear activists
hate this way of thinking because it seems to take the heat off
countries to disarm. But since the nine nuclear states won't be
scuppering their weapons tomorrow, it behooves us in the meantime to
figure out what has gone right, so we can do more of whatever it is.
Foremost is a historical discovery summarized by the political scientist
Robert Jervis: "[The Soviet archives have yet to reveal any serious
plans for unprovoked aggression against Western Europe, not to mention a
**first strike**]{.underline} against the United States."89 [That means
that the intricate weaponry and strategic doctrines for nuclear
deterrence during the Cold War---what one political scientist called
"nuclear metaphysics"---were deterring an attack that the Soviets had
**no interest in launching in the first place**]{.underline}.90 When the
Cold War ended, the fear of massive invasions and preemptive nuclear
strikes faded with it, and (as we shall see) both sides felt relaxed
enough to slash their weapon stockpiles without even bothering with
formal negotiations.91 [Contrary to a theory of **technological
determinism** in which nuclear weapons **start a war all by
themselves**, the risk **very much depends on the state of international
relations**]{.underline}. Much of the credit for the absence of nuclear
war between great powers must go to the forces behind the decline of war
between great powers (chapter 11). Anything that reduces the risk of war
reduces the risk of nuclear war. The [**[close calls,
too]{.underline}**, [may not]{.underline}]{.mark} [[depend on]{.mark} a
supernatural streak of good [luck]{.mark}.]{.underline} Several
[political scientists and historians who have analyzed
[documents]{.mark} from the Cuban Missile Crisis, [particularly
transcripts]{.mark} of]{.underline} John F. [Kennedy's
meetings]{.underline} with his security advisors, [have [argued]{.mark}
that despite the participants' **recollections**]{.underline} [about
having pulled the world back from the brink of Armageddon, "**[the
odds]{.mark} that the [Americans would]{.mark} have [go]{.mark}ne [to
war were]{.mark} next to [zero]{.mark}**."]{.underline}92 The records
show that [Khrushchev and Kennedy remained in **firm
control**]{.underline} of their governments, [and]{.underline} that
[each sought a peaceful end to the crisis, ignoring provocations and
leaving themselves several options for backing down. The hair-raising
[false alarms and]{.mark} brushes with [**accidental** launches]{.mark}
also need not imply that the gods smiled on us]{.underline} again and
again. [They might instead [show]{.mark} that the [**human** and
**technological** **links**]{.mark} **in the chain**
[were]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[predisposed]{.underline}** [to prevent
catastrophe]{.underline}]{.mark}[s, [and]{.mark} were **[strengthened
after each mishap]{.mark}**]{.underline}.93 In their report on nuclear
close calls, [the Union of Concerned Scientists summarizes the history
with refreshing judiciousness: "The fact that such a launch has not
occurred so far suggests that **[safety measures]{.mark} work well
enough to [make the chance of]{.mark} such an [incident
small]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But it is not zero."94 Thinking about our
predicament in this way allows us to avoid both panic and complacency.
Suppose that the chance of a catastrophic nuclear war breaking out in a
single year is one percent. (This is a generous estimate: the
probability must be less than that of an accidental launch, because
[**[escalation]{.underline}** [from a **single accident**]{.underline}
[to a full-scale war is **far from automatic**]{.underline}]{.mark}[,
and in seventytwo years the **number of accidental launches has been
zero**]{.underline}.)95 That would surely be an unacceptable risk,
because a little algebra shows that the probability of our going a
century without such a catastrophe is less than 37 percent. But if we
can reduce the annual chance of nuclear war to a tenth of a percent, the
world's odds of a catastrophe-free century increase to 90 percent; at a
hundredth of a percent, the chance rises to 99 percent, and so on.

#### No miscalc or accidents\-\--statistics, human prudence, and safety mechanisms

Why have nuclear weapons not been used since 1945? The more time passes,
the more the question becomes relevant and even puzzling for pessimists.
Most strategists of the 1960s would be stunned to hear that as of 2017,
there still has yet to be another nuclear use in anger. The prospects of
a "nuclear weapons ban" or recurring proposals for
"de-alerting"---instituting changes that can lengthen the time required
to actually use the weapons---make the question even more
relevant. [Has mankind \[humanity\] really stood "on the brink" several
times since Nagasaki, and have we avoided nuclear catastrophe mostly
because of pure "luck"?]{.underline} 1 Recent books, articles, and
reports, as well as two wide-audience documentaries, say yes.2 This is
not the case. The **[absence of any deliberate [nuclear
explosion]{.mark}]{.underline}** (except for testing) [since
1945 [can]{.mark} simply [be explained by human
prudence and]{.mark} the [efficiency of mechanisms devoted
to the guardianship]{.mark}of nuclear weapons.]{.underline} Banning
nuclear weapons may or may not be a good idea. But it should not be
based on the myth of an inherently and permanently high risk of nuclear
use. [The analysis that follows covers the deliberate use of nuclear
weapons by a legitimate authority, either by error]{.underline} ("false
alarm") [or not]{.underline} ("nuclear crisis"). It does not cover the
risk of an accidental nuclear explosion, an unauthorized launch, or a
terrorist act.3 **[It covers [37 different known
episodes]{.mark},]{.underline}** including 25 alleged nuclear crises and
twelve technical incidents, which have been mentioned in the literature
to one degree or another as potentially dangerous.4 The short answer? If
we are to discard Pope John Paul II's explanation ("Divine
Providence"),5 it is that [[the system worked]{.mark} and that, with
rare exceptions,[those in charge]{.mark} of nuclear weapons [have
been responsible, prudent, and careful]{.mark}. "Close calls" have
ranged in fact from "not-so-close" to "very distant."]{.underline} False
Alarms A number of technical incidents have taken place since 1945, all
of which led to one degree or another to nuclear precautionary measures,
generally involving the elevation of alert levels. Most of these
incidents are well documented, but one of them does not seem to have
taken place at all. It was revealed in 2015 that in the midst of the
Cuban Missile Crisis, a Mace missile squadron based in Okinawa received
a launch order.6 The ambassador of a Latin American country to the
United Nations claimed that this incident "could have altered the course
of civilization forever." 7 One should note that according to the
account---based on a single testimony---the safeguards worked: given
that the procedure was not respected (the order came at DEFCON-2,
whereas it was supposed to happen only at DEFCON-1), the unit commander
suspended the launch.8 In any case, an in-depth inquiry by Stars &
Stripes magazine at the end of 2015 did not find any confirmation of the
incident; U.S. Air Force historians did not find any trace of it.9 At
least a dozen real incidents took place in the United States in the
1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. (Even though there is little or no evidence
that as many happened in other countries, one should assume that some
also occurred in the Soviet Union or elsewhere.)10 In these cases, alert
levels were elevated due to a false alarm, generally caused by the
malfunction of a technical system. For instance, in 1960 a U.S. early
warning radar in Greenland confused the moonrise with a missile
launch.11 In 1961, a dysfunctional transmitter made the Strategic Air
Command (SAC) believe that its lines of communication had been cut
off.12 In 1962, a cascade of minor incidents and misinterpretation led
to bombers being put on alert.13 The same year, a rare conjunction of
events led a U.S. radar station to believe that a Soviet missile attack
was underway.14 Something similar occurred in 1967, when a solar storm
jammed three early warning radars.15 In 1980, two incidents caused by
faulty computer chips led U.S. authorities to mistakenly believe that a
Soviet attack could be underway.16 In the Soviet Union, a well-known
1983 incident of the same sort was recently publicized through a
documentary entitled The Man Who Saved The World (2014), according to
which "millions of lives were hanging by a thread," and no less than
"the end of our civilization" was at stake.17 A more sobering account of
the incident casts serious doubts on whether this was actually the case.
When the alarm sounded in the Soviet nuclear command center because of a
U.S. missile launch, the officer in charge suspected that it was a
mistake and requested visual confirmation. Such confirmation never came,
and the command thus stood down.18 Some incidents involve direct human
errors. This was the case for the infamous magnetic tape mistake of
1979, which went up the chain of command to the U.S. presidency. Woken
up by a phone call announcing that 200 missiles were coming in the
direction of U.S. territory, National Security Advisor Zbigniew
Brzezinski requested a confirmation.19 He was informed a couple of
minutes later that ten times that number of missiles had now been
detected. The cause was the insertion of a tape used for training and
exercises in SAC computers. Nobody knows what President Jimmy Carter
would have done had Brzezinski told him that he only had a few minutes
to decide, but can one seriously believe that he would have launched a
massive counter-strike in the absence of any confirmation that an attack
was underway? In a few of these incidents, a real launch caused
confusion. In 1980, for instance, the Soviet Union launched four
submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) as part of an exercise,
and a U.S. early warning radar wrongly judged that one of them was going
in the direction of the United States. This evaluation was quickly
corrected.20 The Norwegian rocket launch of 1995 belongs in the same
category and has become another poster child for nuclear dangers.
However, the episode should rather be taken as a testimony to Russian
cool-headedness. Norwegian and American scientists launched a new type
of rocket, the Black Brant XII, in order to study weather data; they had
sent word of the launch to Moscow, but the information had not reached
the appropriate authorities. Since Black Brant XII was new, large, and
with a high-altitude trajectory, its launch was interpreted as a
possible missile strike. Some in the general staff raised the hypothesis
of a highaltitude electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) detonation. Yeltsin
considered an interception, but it soon became clear that Russia was not
a target. "After the rocket emerged onto a ballistic curve, the
direction of the flight became clear, and we could see that it would in
no way touch on Russian territory, but land in the Spitsbergen
region---we calmed down and took no serious measures ... "21 Generals
Vladimir Dvorkin, a well-known Russian expert, and Eugene Habiger,
former head of STRATCOM, denied that the incident had any character of
gravity.22 The System Worked Based on the above examples, one must
wonder: is luck a necessary hypothesis to explain why none of these
events led to nuclear war? Is it not at least equally possible that
since 1945, people in charge of nuclear weapons "have taken greater care
\[of them\] than is taken in any other situation involving human agents
and complex mechanical systems"? 23
Nuclear-armed **[[countries h]{.mark}ave [set up]{.mark}
[mechanisms]{.mark} designed [to ensure]{.mark} that [nuclear weapons
will not be used by mistake. This includes fail-safe]{.mark}
[procedures]{.mark} (where non-use remains the default condition up
until the last possible moment) [as well as dual]{.mark}
[phenomenology]{.mark}(the need to confirm the attack by two independent
means relying on different physical principles).]{.underline}** When The
Man Who Saved The World was shown in New York City, the Russian mission
to the United Nations issued a communiqué that stated: "Under no
circumstances a decision to use nuclear weapons could be made or even
considered in the Soviet Union (Russia) or in the United States on the
basis of data from a single source or a system. For this to happen,
[a [confirmation is necessary from several systems]{.mark}: ground-based
radars, early-warning satellites, intelligence reports, etc." 24 In all
the incidents mentioned above, safety mechanisms worked, even in the
early 1960s when they were still rudimentary. Furthermore, is it
credible to imagine that the head of a State or government would order a
nuclear strike without being certain that a major military attack was
underway? U.S. nuclear expert Jeffrey G. Lewis rightly argues that he
cannot imagine that an American president would embark in nuclear
reprisals if there was the slightest doubt on the reality of the
attack.25 Retired Russian General Vladimir Dvorkin thinks similarly,
claiming that "No president, no matter what president it is, will ever
make a decision about launch-onwarning based on information about one
rocket]{.underline} or missile or even ... two or three missiles." 26
From the point of view of logic and complex systems analysis, it remains
possible that a combination of incidents can lead to the failure of all
safety mechanisms designed to prevent accidental nuclear war. Such a
thesis is embodied by the classic work of Scott D. Sagan, The Limits of
Safety. It would thus only be "a matter of time" due to cumulative
probabilities.27 In a recent documentary about nuclear risks, author
Eric Schlosser reiterates the point: "it's also due to luck, pure luck,
and the problem with luck is that eventually it runs out ... Every
machine ever invented eventually goes wrong." 28 [But the probability of
failure increases markedly with time only if conditions do not
change---and conditions do change. [Safety mechanisms have been
perfected]{.mark} (without necessarily becoming more
complex) [and lessons]{.mark} of past incidents [are being
learned.]{.mark} [S]{.mark}agan claimed in 1993 that the Yom Kippur war
(see below), as well as the 1979 and 1980 incidents (see above), are
proof that organizations fail to learn from experience. But if that was
the case, **why would the number of [known incidents have significantly
declined since]{.mark} 1983? [We only know of one]{.mark} significant
incident [in]{.mark} nearly [35 years]{.mark}**]{.underline}: the Black
Brant XII episode. Charles Perrow, the father of "normal accidents"
theory (those resulting from the complexity and interconnection of
systems), wrote: "with regard to firing \[nuclear weapons\] after a
false warning we reach a surprising conclusion, one I was not prepared
for: [because of the safety systems involved in a launchon-warning
scenario, it is virtually impossible for wellintended actions to bring
about an accidental attack." 29]{.underline}

#### No accidents---safeguards and ocean targeting

**Slocombe 9** \[Walter, senior advisor for the Coalition Provisional
Authority in Baghdad and a former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy,
he is a four-time recipient of an award for Distinguished Public Service
and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, "De-Alerting:
Diagnoses, Prescriptions, and Side-Effects," Presented at the seminar on
Re-framing De-Alert: Decreasing the Operational Readiness of Nuclear
Weapons Systems in the US-Russia Context in Yverdon, Switzerland, June
21-23\]

Let's start with Technical Failure -- the focus of a great deal of the
advocacy, or at least of stress on past incidents of failures of safety
and control mechanisms.4 Much of the "de-alerting" literature points to
a succession of failures to follow proper procedures and draw from that
history the inference that a relatively simple procedural failure could
produce a nuclear detonation. The argument is essentially that nuclear
weapons systems are sufficiently susceptible of pure accident (including
human error or failure at operational/field level) that it is essential
to take measures that have the effect of making it necessary to
undertake a prolonged reconfiguration of the elements of the nuclear
weapons force for a launch or detonation to be physically possible.
Specific measures said to serve this objective include separating the
weapons from their launchers, burying silo doors, removal of fuzing or
launching mechanisms, deliberate avoidance of maintenance measures need
to permit rapid firing, and the like. . My view is that this line of
action is unnecessary in its own terms and highly problematic from the
point of view of other aspects of the problem and that there is a far
better option that is largely already in place, at least in the US force
-- the requirement of external information -- a code not held by the
operators \-- to arm the weapons Advocates of other, more "physical,"
measures often describe the current arrangement as nuclear weapons being
on a "[[hair trigger]{.mark}." That [is]{.mark} -- at least with respect
to US weapons -- a highly [misleading]{.mark}
characterization]{.underline}. The "hair trigger" figure of speech
confuses "alert" status -- readiness to act quickly on orders \-- with
susceptibility to inadvertent action. The ["hair trigger" image implies
that a minor mistake]{.underline} -- akin to jostling a gun -- [will
fire the weapon. The US StratCom commander had a more accurate metaphor
when he recently said that US nuclear [weapons are]{.mark} less a pistol
with a hair trigger than like a pistol in a holster with the safety
turned on]{.underline} -- and he might have added that [in the case of
nuclear weapons the "safety" is [locked]{.mark} in place [by]{.mark} a
[combination]{.mark} lock that can only be opened [and]{.mark} firing
made possible if the soldier carrying the pistol receives a message from
his chain of command giving him the combination]{.underline}. Whatever
other problems the current nuclear posture of the US nuclear force may
present, it cannot reasonably be said to be on a "hair trigger." Since
the 1960s [the US has taken a series of measures to insure that US
nuclear weapons [cannot be detonated without]{.mark} the receipt of both
[external info]{.mark}rmation [and]{.mark} properly [authenticated
authorization]{.mark} to use that information]{.underline}. These
devices -- generically Permissive Action Links or "PALs" -- are in
effect combination locks that keep the weapons locked and incapable of
detonation unless and until the weapons' firing mechanisms have been
unlocked following receipt of a series of numbers communicated to the
operators from higher authority. Equally important in the context of a
military organization, [launch of nuclear weapons]{.underline}
(including insertion of the combinations) [is permitted only where
properly authorized by an authenticated order.]{.underline} [[This
combination]{.underline}]{.mark} of reliance on discipline and procedure
and on receipt of an unlocking code not held by the military personnel
in charge of the launch operation [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} designed to
insure that the system is "[[fail safe]{.underline}]{.mark}," i.e., that
whatever mistakes occur, the result will not be a nuclear explosion.
Moreover, [[in recent years]{.mark}, both [the US and Russia, as well
as]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}Britain and
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, [have [modified]{.mark} their [procedures
so]{.mark} that [**even if**]{.mark} a nuclear-armed missile were
[**launched**, it would go]{.mark} not to a "real" target in another
country but -- at least in the US case - [to empty
ocean]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition to the basic advantage of
insuring against a nuclear detonation in a populated area, the fact that
a missile launched in error would be on flight path that diverged from a
plausible attacking trajectory should be detectable by either the US or
the Russian warning systems, reducing the possibility of the accident
being perceived as a deliberate attack. [De-targeting]{.underline},
therefore, [provides a significant protection against technical
error]{.underline}. These arrangements -- [[PALs
and]{.underline}]{.mark} their equivalents coupled with continued
observance of the agreement made in the mid-90s on
"[[de-targeting]{.underline}]{.mark}" -- do not eliminate the
possibility of technical or operator-level failures, but they
[[come]{.mark} very [close to]{.mark} providing [absolute assurance
that]{.mark} such [errors cannot]{.mark} lead to a nuclear explosion or
[be interpreted]{.mark} as the start of a deliberate nuclear
attack]{.underline}.6 The advantage of such requirements for external
information to activate weapons is of course that [the weapons remain
available for authorized use but not susceptible of appropriation or
mistaken use.]{.underline}

#### No blackouts

**Larson 18** Selena Larson, Cyber threat intelligence analyst at
Dragos, Inc. \[Threats to Electric Grid are Real; Widespread Blackouts
are Not, 8-6-2018,

[**The US [electric grid]{.mark}** is [not about to go
down]{.mark}]{.underline}. Though it's understandable if someone
believed that. Over the last few weeks, numerous media reports suggest
state-backed hackers have infiltrated the US electric grid and are
capable of manipulating the flow of electricity on a grand scale and
cause chaos. [Threats]{.underline} against industrial sectors including
electric utilities, oil and gas, and manufacturing [are
growing,]{.underline} and it's reasonable for people to be concerned.
[But to say hackers]{.underline} have [invaded the US electric grid and
are prepared to cause blackouts is false]{.underline}. The initial
reporting stemmed from a public Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
presentation in July on Russian hacking activity targeting US electric
utilities. This presentation contained previously-reported information
on a group known as Dragonfly by Symantec and which Dragos associates to
activity labeled DYMALLOY and ALLANITE. These
[[groups]{.underline}]{.mark} focus on information gathering from
industrial control system (ICS) networks and [[have not demonstrated
**disruptive**]{.mark} **or damaging
[capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While some news reports cite 2015
and 2016 blackouts in Ukraine as evidence of hackers' disruptive
capabilities, DYMALLOY nor ALLANITE were involved in those incidents and
it is inaccurate to suggest the DHS's public presentation and those
destructive behaviors are linked. [Adversaries]{.underline} have not
placed "cyber implants" into the electric grid to cause blackouts; but
they are [infiltrating business networks]{.underline} -- and in some
cases, ICS networks -- in an effort to steal information and
intelligence to potentially gain access to operational systems. Overall,
the activity is concerning and represents the prerequisites towards a
potential future disruptive event -- [but [evidence]{.mark}]{.underline}
to date [[does not support the claim]{.mark} that such [an attack is
imminent]{.mark}. **The US [electric grid]{.mark}** [is **resilient**
and **segmented**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [although it makes an
interesting plot to an action movie]{.underline}, one or two strains of
malware [[**targeting operational networks** would not cause
**widespread blackouts**]{.mark}. A destructive incident at one site
[would require **highly-tailored tools**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and
**operations**]{.mark} and [would not **effectively
scale**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Essentially, [**localized impacts** are
possible]{.underline}, and asset owners and operators should work to
defend their networks from intrusions such as those described by DHS.
[But scaling up]{.underline} from isolated events to widespread impacts
[is **highly unlikely**]{.underline}.

have begun to provide direct support for combat operations, such as
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flown in Afghanistan from fixed
installations here in the United States. Our fixed installations also
serve as staging platforms for humanitarian and homeland defense
missions. These installations are largely dependent on a commercial
power grid that is vulnerable to disruption due to aging infrastructure,
weather-related events, and potential kinetic, cyber attack.
[In]{.underline} **[2008]{.underline}**, [the Defense Science Board

installed equipment, DoD maintains a strategic stockpile of electrical
power generators and support equipment that is kept in operational
readiness. For example, during Hurricane Katrina, the Air Force
transported more than 2 megawatts of specialized diesel generators from
Florida, where they were stored, to Keesler Air Force Base in
Mississippi, to support base recovery.

The Role of Microgrids in Improving Energy Security

• [[Advanced microgrids with renewable energy can enhance energy

• Today, no bases operate using solely renewable energy. With a
microgrid, renewable energy with energy storage can significantly extend
islanding time in the event of a power outage.

• [[If power is cut off]{.underline}]{.mark} to an installation,
[[microgrids]{.underline}]{.mark} can **[[automatically prioritize
mission critical activities,]{.mark}]{.underline}** and shed less
important uses of power.

• [[Microgrids]{.mark} can also [improve]{.mark} the **[resiliency of

[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [strategic [importance of

[internally and externally]{.underline}. [Senior leaders are
[re-focusing]{.mark}]{.underline} some of the Department's [[energy

Although there are steps the Department can and should take on its own
to improve resilience and continuity of operations, achieving more
comprehensive electric grid security to ensure critical Department of
Defense missions is not something the Department of Defense can do
acting alone. Meeting and securing the Department of Defense's critical
electric power needs in an interdependent and increasingly complex risk
environment requires a broad scope of collaborative engagement between
government and industry stakeholders whose roles and responsibilities in
power grid security and resiliency are distributed and shared. While
there are maintenance and on-site power surety efforts that need some
new focus, for the Department of Defense to succeed in this challenge,
leadership and support from industry representatives and interagency
partners at various levels of government are imperative.

The Department of [Defense is collaborating with]{.underline} the
[D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f [E]{.underline}nergy, the

regional scale throughout the country and be used [to support the
development of a new system \"design basis\" for]{.underline} [building
additional resilience in the U.S. electric power grid]{.underline}. We
are also working with the North American Electric Reliability
Corporation on planning a case study of a military installation for
analysis, paired up with the local utility provider to determine what
can be done in the short-term to mitigate electric power vulnerabilities
and risks. The Department is also participating in exercises such as the
recent National Level Exercise-11 exercise and upcoming Departments of
Homeland Security, Energy and Defense sponsored Secure Grid 2011 and the
North American Electric Reliability Corporation's GridEx 2011.

[These [partnerships will help]{.mark}]{.underline} the Department of

This year the Department of Defense submitted a report to Congress under
Section 335 of the 2009 National Defense Authorization Act. Section 335
requires the Department to submit an annual report to Congress on
efforts to mitigate the risks posed to Department of Defense mission
critical installations, facilities, and activities by extended power
outages resulting from failure of the commercial electricity supply or
grid and related infrastructure. Congress enacted Section 335 of the
National Defense Authorization Act in response to the publication of a

"critical national security and homeland defense missions are at an

### AT: Nuclear Meltdowns\-\--1NC

#### No meltdowns impact.

**Shellenberger 19** Michael Shellenberger, author, environmental policy
writer, cofounder of Breakthrough Institute and founder of Environmental
Progress, Time Magazine "Hero of the Environment." \[It Sounds Crazy,
But Fukushima, Chernobyl, And Three Mile Island Show Why Nuclear Is
Inherently Safe, 3-11-19,
https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2019/03/11/it-sounds-crazy-but-fukushima-chernobyl-and-three-mile-island-show-why-nuclear-is-inherently-safe/#5b4a65ff1688\]

But now, eight years after Fukushima, the best-available science clearly
shows that Caldicott's estimate of the number of people killed by
nuclear accidents was off by one million. Radiation from Chernobyl will
kill, at most, 200 people, while the radiation from Fukushima and Three
Mile Island will kill zero people. In other words, [the main
[lesson]{.mark} that should be drawn [from]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[the
worst]{.mark} nuclear [accidents]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[is]{.mark}
that [nuclear]{.mark} energy [has **always been**]{.mark} **inherently
[safe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The truth about nuclear power's safety is
so shocking that it's worth taking a closer look at the worst accidents,
starting with the worst of the worst: Chernobyl. The nuclear plant is in
Ukraine which, in 1986, the year of the accident, was a Soviet Republic.
Operators lost control of an unauthorized experiment that resulted in
the reactor catching fire. There was no containment dome, and the fire
spewed out radioactive particulate matter, which went all over the
world, leading many to conclude that Chernobyl is not just the worst
nuclear accident in history but is also the worst nuclear accident
possible. Twenty-eight firefighters died after putting out the Chernobyl
fire. While the death of any firefighter is tragic, it's worth putting
that number in perspective. Eighty-six firefighters died in the U.S. in
2018, and 343 firefighters died during the September 11, 2001 terrorist
attacks. Since the Chernobyl accident, 19 first responders have died,
according to the United Nations, for "various reasons" including
tuberculosis, cirrhosis of the liver, heart attacks, and trauma. The
U.N. concluded that "the assignment of radiation as the cause of death
has become less clear." What about cancer? By 2065 there may be 16,000
thyroid cancers; to date there have been 6,000. Since thyroid cancer has
a mortality rate of just one percent --- it is an easy cancer to treat
--- expected deaths may be 160. The World Health Organization claims on
its web site that Chernobyl could result in the premature [deaths of
4,000 people, but according to Dr. Geraldine Thomas, who started and
runs the Chernobyl Tissue Bank, that number is based on]{.underline}
**[a [disproven]{.mark} methodology]{.underline}**. "That WHO number is
based on [LNT]{.mark}," she explained, using the acronym for the "linear
no-threshold" method of extrapolating deaths from radiation. LNT assumes
that there is no threshold below which radiation is safe, but that
assumption [has been discredited]{.mark} over recent decades **[[by
multiple]{.mark} sources of [data]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Support for
the idea that radiation is harmless at low levels comes from the fact
that people who live in places with higher background radiation, like
Colorado, do not suffer elevated rates of cancer. In fact, residents of
Colorado, where radiation is higher because of high concentrations of
uranium in the ground, enjoy some of the lowest cancer rates in the U.S.
Even relatively high doses of radiation cause far less harm than most
people think. Careful, large, and long-term studies of survivors of the
atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki offer compelling
demonstration. [[Cancer rates were]{.underline}]{.mark} **[just [10
percent higher among]{.mark} atomic [blast
survivors]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, most]{.mark} of whom [never got
cancer]{.mark}. Even those who received a dose 1,000 times higher than
today's safety limit saw their lives cut short by an average of 16
months. But didn't the Japanese government recently award a financial
settlement to the family of a Fukushima worker who claimed his cancer
was from the accident? It did, but for reasons that were clearly
political, and having to do with the Japanese government's
consensus-based, conflict-averse style, as well as lingering guilt felt
by elite policymakers toward Fukushima workers and residents, who felt
doubly aggrieved by the tsunami and meltdowns. The worker's cancer was
highly unlikely to have come from Fukushima because, once again, the
level of radiation workers received was far lower than the ones received
by the Hiroshima/Nagasaki cohort that saw (modestly) higher cancer
rates. What about Three Mile Island? After the accident in 1979, Time
Magazine ran a cover story that superimposed a glowing headline,
"Nuclear Nightmare," over an image of the plant. [**[Nightmare? More
like a dream.]{.underline}** [What other]{.underline}]{.mark} [**major
industrial** [technology can suffer]{.mark} a [catastrophic failure and
not kill anyone]{.mark}]{.underline}[?]{.mark} Remember when the
Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig caught on fire and killed 11 people?
Four months later, a Pacific Gas & Electric natural gas pipeline
exploded just south of San Francisco and killed eight people sleeping in
their beds. And that was just one year, 2010. The worst energy accident
of all time was the 1975 collapse of the Banqiao hydroelectric dam in
China. It collapsed and killed between 170,000 and 230,000 people.
Nuclear's worst accidents show that the technology has always been safe
for the same, inherent reason that it has always had such a small
environmental impact: the high energy density of its fuel. [[Splitting
atoms]{.mark} to create heat, rather than than splitting chemical bonds
through fire, [requires t**iny**]{.mark} **amounts of
[fuel]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A single Coke can of uranium can provide
enough energy for an entire high-energy life. [[When the worst
occurs]{.mark}, and the fuel melts, [the amount]{.mark} of particulate
matter [that escapes]{.mark} from the plant [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[insignificant]{.underline}**]{.mark} in contrast to both the fiery
explosions of fossil fuels and the daily emission of particulate matter
from fossil- and biomass-burning homes, cars, and power plants, which
kill seven million people a year. It\'s not that nuclear energy never
kills. It\'s that nuclear\'s [[death toll is]{.underline} **[vanishingly
small]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Consider nuclear\'s global death toll in
context. These are just annual deaths. - walking: 270,000 - driving:
1,350,000 - working: 2,300,000 - air pollution: 4,200,000 By contrast,
nuclear\'s death total is likely to be **[[around
200]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Worst-case power-loss scenario With backup systems to the backup
systems, it would seem that there's nothing to worry about, right? Under
all but the direst of circumstances, I think that assessment is correct.
However, [one could imagine a scenario in which the grid was lost and
the diesel generators ran out of fuel]{.underline}. Speaking of fuel,
how much is actually stored onsite? It depends on the plant, but at the
Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, for example, [there is [**enough fuel** to
run]{.mark}]{.underline} the emergency diesel [[generators for **at
least 42 days**]{.underline}]{.mark}. I say at least because it would
depend on exactly what was being powered. Once the reactor was cooled
down, [a much smaller system, known as the Residual Heat Removal System,
would be all that was required to keep the fuel assemblies
cool]{.underline}, both in the reactor and the spent fuel rods pool.
[The generators and [onsite fuel supply could power that smaller
cooling]{.mark} system]{.underline} for significantly longer than if
they were powering the larger reactor cooling system. [[Even if we
assumed **a worst case**]{.mark} **of 42 days**, it's hard to imagine a
scenario in which that would not be [**enough time** to bring in
additional fuel]{.mark} either by land, water, or air.]{.underline}
Nonetheless, let's push the question a little further. [What would
happen in the unlikely event that the diesel fuel was
exhausted?]{.underline} Even with the reactor having been successfully
cooled, the biggest risk would continue to be overheating of the fuel
rod assemblies, both in the reactor and the spent fuel rods pool.
Without circulation, the heat from the fuel rod assemblies could boil
the surrounding water, resulting in steam. In turn, the water levels
would drop, ultimately exposing the fuel rods to air. Once exposed to
air, their [[temperatures would rise but not to the levels that would
melt]{.mark} **the [zirconium cladding]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Thankfully, [that means]{.underline} that **[[meltdown would not
occur]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The steam might well carry radioactive
contaminants into the air, but [there would be [**no release of
hydrogen** and,]{.mark} thus, [no]{.mark} **subsequent

The [nuclear crisis at Fukushima]{.underline} Daiichi in Japan has
[caused a nuclear frenzy where leaders around the world are questioning
the safety of their plants.]{.underline} For instance, French President
Nicolas Sarkozy called for global nuclear review after visiting Japan,
and U.S. senators demanded that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)
repeat an expensive inspection of the country\'s nuclear power.¶ But
now, [the [NRC]{.mark} is close to completing **a [large nuclear
study]{.mark} that may ease a few worried minds**]{.underline}.¶ The NRC
has been [[working with Sandia]{.underline}]{.mark} National
[[Lab]{.underline}]{.mark}oratories (a Department of Energy lab) [on a
study that **[revises]{.mark}**]{.underline} previous [[**projections**
of how quickly]{.mark} and how much [cesium]{.mark} 137,]{.underline}
which is a radioactive material made when uranium is split, [[could
release from]{.mark} a plant after [a]{.mark} nuclear core
[meltdown]{.mark}]{.underline}. The NRC has been working on the study
for six years, and it will not be completely finished until next spring.
But the nuclear watchdog group, Union of Concerned Scientists, has
obtained an early copy of the report through a Freedom of Information
Act request.¶ The new study is based on how much and how quickly cesium
137 could escape an American nuclear plant **[[if a total blackout were
to occur]{.mark}.]{.underline}** A total blackout means complete loss of
power from the grid, and backup diesel generators and batteries have
failed as well. This leads to a nuclear meltdown. NRC scientists said
that a total blackout would be rare at an American plant, but it is
better to be safe than sorry. In addition, the NRC wanted to update
previous projections related to cesium 137.¶ The NRC focused on two
different types of reactors in the U.S.: the Peach Bottom Atomic Power
Station in Pennsylvania, which has boiling-water reactors like Fukushima
Daiichi, and the Surry Power Station in Virginia, which has
pressurized-water reactors. **[[Over 100]{.underline}]{.mark}**
different [[plants were studied]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Through
**computer models** and engineering analyses]{.mark}, the [NRC]{.mark}
has [concluded]{.mark} that the [meltdown]{.mark}]{.underline} of a
typical American reactor **[[would lead to \"far fewer deaths\"]{.mark}
than previously thought.]{.underline}**¶ According to the new study,
**[[only 1 to 2 percent of]{.mark} a reactor core\'s [cesium]{.mark} 137
[could escape]{.mark}]{.underline}** during a total blackout. Previous
NRC estimates concluded that 60 percent of the cesium inventory could
escape.¶ In addition, the new study found that **[[one person in every
4,348 within a 10-mile radius]{.underline}]{.mark}** of a nuclear
meltdown [[would develop]{.mark} a \"latent
[cancer]{.mark}\"]{.underline} from radiation exposure. In previous
estimates, it was one person in every 167.¶ The NRC said that [large
releases of radioactive material would not be \"immediate,\"
meaning]{.underline} that [[people]{.underline}]{.mark} within a 10-mile
radius **[would [have plenty of time to evacuate]{.mark}]{.underline}**
the premises. It concluded that the chance of death from acute radiation
exposure within a 10-mile radius would be near zero, but some would be
exposed to high enough doses to experience fatal cancers decades later.¶
\"[[Accidents progress]{.mark} more [slowly]{.mark}]{.underline}, in
some cases much more slowly, [than previously assumed,\"]{.underline}
said Charles G. Tinkler, a senior adviser for research on severe
accidents and an author of the study. \"[Releases are
smaller]{.underline}, and in some cases much smaller, of certain key
radioactive materials.\"

In an atmosphere of crisis permeated by mutual recriminations and

military activities along the line of contact. These maneuvers in turn
have triggered multiple warnings from both sides of a sharp
deterioration in European security, a growing threat of a military

the situation in order to avoid a catastrophic war with disastrous
consequences for all. An [emerging conventional wisdom

3 Studies on potential nuclear escalation scenarios

[The question [whether Russia would use]{.mark}]{.underline} its
[**[nuc]{.mark}lear force[s]{.mark}** in the Baltic region
has]{.underline} **[also intrigued many]{.underline}** academics and
military experts recently. One of the most radical discussions in this
field is a blog post by Loren B. Thompson, 'Why the Baltic states are
where nuclear war is most likely to begin'. He argues that the
likelihood of nuclear war between Russia and the United States is
probably growing and is the reason why it is most likely going to start
is a future military confrontation over three Baltic countries. Thompson
describes eight reasons why nuclear weapons could potentially be used in
future warfighting scenarios with regard to the Baltics and argues that
according to the bottom-line scenario, the East--West conflict escalates
into the use of nuclear weapons in the Baltic area, and neither side of
the conflict understands what actions might provoke nuclear use by the
other. Thompson comes to a somewhat surprising conclusion \-- at least
in the eyes of the Baltic countries \-- that the United States needs to
reassess the situation, suggesting that it would make no sense to tie
security of the United States to countries of 'such modest importance
that are situated in such unpromising tactical circumstances' (Thompson,
2016).

Potential nuclear conflict escalation scenarios are in more detail
discussed in another publication, a NATO playbook entitled 'Preventing
escalation in the Baltics' by Ulrich Kühn. The author argues that the
risk of escalating a wider conflict between Russia and NATO is
dangerously high particularly in the case of the Baltic countries
because it would be difficult for NATO to defend the region. Kühn
suggest three possible escalation scenarios, i.e., deliberate
escalation, inadvertent escalation, and accidental escalation. All three
scenarios also involve nuclear threats; however, two of the scenarios
stop short of actual Russian nuclear-weapon usage (Kühn, 2018). The
analysis provides an interesting hypothetical construct for the experts
at both the transatlantic and local levels, as it points to many
practical issues in regard to the nuclear deterrence from the NATO's
political decision-making process to the role of domestic policies in
tackling such a crisis.

Conflict escalation scenarios that involve nuclear capabilities are
discussed also in other studies. For example, in a study called
'Reducing the risk of nuclear war in the Nordic/Baltic region' by Barry
Blechman and co-authors, two scenarios of conventional war ending in the
exchange of nuclear weapons are constructed (namely, 'Escalation in
Estonia' and 'Regional War'). Although the authors emphasize that the
scenarios are purely illustrative and [the [probability]{.mark} of
nuclear use [is **low**]{.mark}]{.underline}, they argue that it is
useful to reduce these risks even further and suggest two initiatives,
such as a strengthening of the Alliance's conventional military
capabilities and particularly the ability to move quickly into the
Baltic region, as well as to establish a Baltic nuclear weapons free
zone, or at least examining the possibility to do so (for further
discussion, see Blechman et at., 2015). Jüri Luik and Tomas
Jermalavičius in their article 'A plausible scenario of nuclear war in
Europe, and how to deter it: A perspective from Estonia' point to
various alarming signs, e.g., Russia's large-scale exercises incorporate
limited nuclear strike scenarios against NATO as part of Russia's
'escalation to de-escalate' strategy; Russia is expanding the range of
its tactical delivery systems, the country's political rhetoric includes
nuclear threats toward the West, and so on. They emphasize that the
Alliance's range of response options to such threats and limited nuclear
war scenarios has shrunk considerably and that the Alliance lacks a
collective will to call those threats a bluff (Luik and Jermalavičius,
2017).

A large part of the research in this field more or less considers it
likely that Russia could use its nuclear forces in the Baltic region.
However, there are also articles that oppose this conviction. For
example, Viljar Veebel and Illimar Ploom in 'The deterrence credibility
of NATO and the readiness of the Baltic states to employ the deterrence
instruments' disagree with the idea that the Baltic countries could be
under potential nuclear attack, which could in turn evolve to a nuclear
war. They argue that [although Russia and NATO as potential conflict
parties **have a striking capability**, [it would be
**irrational**]{.mark} **for both of them**]{.underline} [to execute a
nuclear strike]{.underline} **[[even as]{.mark} a measure of [last
resort]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The authors stress that [it
is]{.underline} **[[hard to believe]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that [Russia
has]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[any]{.mark} rational [motivation to]{.mark}
use [nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon**s in the Baltic**]{.underline}
countrie**[s]{.underline}** because [a large share of [the
population]{.mark} in the Baltic countries [are]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[Russian]{.mark}-speaking]{.underline}**. Likewise, [in case of a
potential conflict,]{.underline} **[territorial
[proximity]{.mark}]{.underline}** [of Russia and the Baltic countries,
[as well as]{.mark} Russia's possible further ambition to]{.underline}
**[legitimate]{.underline}** the [**[annexation]{.underline}** [comes
**in**to play]{.underline}]{.mark}. The argument of
[irrationality]{.underline} **[applies also to]{.underline}** the
**[NATO]{.underline}** alliance [as it would raise a question
about]{.underline} **[morality and escalation]{.underline}** [should
NATO consider]{.underline} using [nuclear attack as a preventative
measure. In addition, [there are]{.mark} several **[logical
gaps]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in the chain of arguments justifying the
use of nuclear weapons against Russia]{.underline} if the latter has
fully or partially invaded the Baltic countries. The authors hereby
point to the following questions: First, [[how could]{.mark} the
strategic use of [nuclear weapons]{.mark} against Russia [be
**believable**]{.mark} **in a regional conflict?**]{.underline} Second,
[how would it]{.underline} **[help to solve the conflict]{.underline}**
which has already started? Third, [what would be the **possible positive
outcome for NATO**, [having]{.mark}]{.underline} [**initiated
[m]{.mark}**utually **[a]{.mark}**ssured
**[d]{.mark}**estruction]{.underline} with Russia to stop the
occupations of Baltics? (Veebel and Ploom, 2018a).

A global threat

[India and Pakistan\'s nuclear arsenals are tiny]{.underline} compared
to those of the [United States and
Russia](http://thedrive.com/the-war-zone/26013/russia-says-its-own-new-weapons-are-exempt-after-accusing-u-s-of-violating-nuclear-arms-deal),
and these weapons are focused primarily on deterring each other, [but
that does **not mean** they\'re **purely regional**
threats]{.underline}. Unlike conventional weapons, [nuclear weapons
create **lasting** and **far-reaching** effects that]{.underline}
scientists have posited [could **upend life on Earth** if]{.underline}
warring [parties]{.underline} were to [use them in sufficient
numbers.]{.underline}

[In 2012](http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/RobockToonSAD.pdf), Alan
Robock, a distinguished professor in the Department of Environmental
 Sciences and Associate Director of the Center for Environmental
Prediction at Rutgers University, and Owen Brian Toon, a professor in
the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences and a research
associate at  the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the
University of Colorado, Boulder, argued that [[it might not take]{.mark}
a **[large]{.mark} amount** of nuclear [weapons to
create]{.mark}]{.underline} a scenario commonly known as [[\"[**Nuclear
Winter**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter).\"]{.underline}]{.mark} 

In general, [this]{.underline} hypothesized event [occurs
when]{.underline} smoke and [soot from nuclear [explosions
block]{.mark}]{.underline} significant amounts of [[sunlight]{.mark}
from]{.underline} reaching the [earth\'s surface, leading to
a]{.underline} precipitous [drop in temperatures that [results
in]{.mark}]{.underline} mass [[**crop failure** and]{.mark} **widespread
[famine]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Robcock and Toon summarized their findings, which were based in part on
their previous work, in an article in the Bulletin of The Atomic
Scientists, [writing](http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/RobockToonSAD.pdf):

> [[\"Even a \'**small**\']{.mark} nuclear [war]{.mark} between

The bomb the United States dropped on Hiroshima Japan, known as [Little
Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy), was an inefficient and
essentially experimental design with a yield of around 15 kilotons. The
reported [results
from [Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests_of_India) and Pakistani
**nuclear testing** indicate]{.underline} that [both
countries]{.underline} can [**meet this threshold** and]{.underline}
both countries\' [weapons programs]{.underline} have almost certainly
[matured in]{.underline} the [decades]{.underline} since.

In previous studies, Robcock, working with others, postulated that
temperature changes could begin within 10 days of a limited nuclear
exchange and the effects from the detonations of 100 nuclear weapons in
the 15-kiloton class would directly result in the deaths of [at least 20
million
people](http://www.nucleardarkness.org/warconsequences/fivemilliontonsofsmoke/).
The [**second order** impacts would be even worse]{.underline} in the
years that followed. 

In 2014, Michael Mills and Julia Lee-Taylor, both then working at the
federally-funded National Center for Atmospheric Research\'s (NCAR)
Earth System Laboratory, authored another paper with Robcock and Toon.
[This [study
concluded](https://web.archive.org/web/20140308191334/http:/acd.ucar.edu/~mmills/pubs/2014_EarthsFuture_Mills_et_al.pdf)]{.underline} again
that [detonation of 100]{.underline} 15-kiloton yield [bombs in a
**purely [regional conflict]{.mark}** would [result in]{.mark}
\"multi-decadal [**global cooling**\" and]{.mark} \"would]{.underline}
put significant pressures on global food supplies and could [trigger a
global **[nuc]{.mark}lear [famine]{.mark}**[.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}

It is important to note that[ critics have
questioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter#Critical_response_to_the_more_modern_papers) whether
the Nuclear Winter concept relies on too many assumptions and would ever
actually occur. At the center of many of these rebuttals are debates
about whether the nuclear explosions would truly create the amount of
smoke and soot necessary for major climate change, as well as the
specific conditions for those particles to remain in the atmosphere for
a prolonged period of time. 

The studies here do indicate significant impacts based on a relatively
limited number of nuclear detonations of smaller yield devices, though.
But even if [the impacts]{.underline} are less pronounced than projected
in this particular scenario, they [could be]{.underline} far [more
severe if India and Pakistan]{.underline} were to [use a larger number
weapons]{.underline} and/[or]{.underline} ones of [**higher yields**,
which both belligerents readily have]{.underline}. 

In addition, [[Nuclear Winter is just **one**]{.mark} of
the]{.underline} potential [[thing]{.mark}s that might happen following
a nuclear exchange]{.underline} between the longtime foes. [A
[detonation of]{.mark} **dozens** of nuclear weapons, **even [small
ones]{.mark}**, would [throw]{.mark}]{.underline} hazardous nuclear
[[fallout [**into the
air**](http://thedrive.com/the-war-zone/19450/u-s-training-for-arctic-nuclear-satellite-disaster-amid-russian-weapons-developments)]{.mark} that]{.underline},
depending on the weather pattern, [could **carry**]{.underline} that
**[material]{.underline}** [far and
wide](https://futureoflife.org/background/us-nuclear-targets/?cn-reloaded=1#nukemap),
causing both near- and short-term health impacts. The various [ground
zeroes](https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/) themselves would be
irritated and potentially hazardous for many years to come.

Depending on where the detonations occur, [a nuclear exchange
could]{.underline} potentially [cut]{.underline} people
[off]{.underline} from critical [**water** and **food**
supplies]{.underline}, putting increased and potentially unsustainable
strains on uncontaminated areas.  After the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant, situated in Ukraine, [melted down and
exploded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster) in 1986,
authorities established a 1,000 square mile restricted access
\"[exclusion
zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Exclusion_Zone)\" that
remains in place today. 

[There would]{.underline} also [be]{.underline} a [major]{.underline}
danger of [**[second-order]{.mark}** \"spillover\" **[effects]{.mark}**,
as individuals fled]{.underline} affected [areas, putting **economic**
and **political strains** on neighboring regions. This could
**[inflame]{.mark}** existing [tensions **not**]{.mark} **directly
[related]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the inter-state
[[conflict]{.mark} between India or Pakistan [or lead to]{.mark} all
new]{.underline} and potentially [**violent [competition]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark}]{.underline} what might already be [**limited
[resources]{.mark}**. India]{.underline} has [already threatened
to [**weaponize water**
access](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/world/asia/india-pakistan-water-kashmir.html) in
its]{.underline} latest [spat with the Pakistanis]{.underline}.

[Any]{.underline} serious [[impacts on food and
water]{.underline}]{.mark} supplies, [or]{.underline} other [economic
upheavals]{.underline} as a direct or indirect result of the conflict,
[[would have **cascading impact**]{.mark} across **South
Asia**]{.underline} and beyond, as well. The very threat of a potential
India-Pakistan war of any kind already caused [some negative
reactions](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/27/indian-air-force-plane-crashes-in-kashmir-says-indian-police-official.html) in
regional financial markets. Those [markets would **certainly collapse**
after]{.underline} an unprecedented [nuclear exchange]{.underline}
actually occurred, and that is before the long-term physical impacts of
such an event would even manifest themselves. 

Overall, we are talking about a sudden and dramatic geopolitical,
financial, and environmental shift that would change our reality in a
matter of hours. Even then, the darkness, both figuratively and
literally, that could propagate over the weeks, months, and years would
be far more damaging. 

How great is the risk?

So far, India and Pakistan have not made any clear indications that the
fighting is close to crossing their nuclear thresholds. Pakistan\'s
warnings about the [risks of
escalation](http://thedrive.com/the-war-zone/26642/pakistan-promises-retaliation-makes-nuclear-threats-after-indian-jets-bomb-its-territory) seem
more calculated to try and prompt India to back down.

[India]{.underline} itself [has a]{.underline} so-called [\"**no first
use**\" policy, which means it]{.underline} has publicly [pledged to
use]{.underline} its [nuclear weapons only in retaliation]{.underline}
to a nuclear strike. [However, experts]{.underline} have increasingly
[**called into question** whether this is]{.underline} truly [the case
and whether India might be developing **delivery
systems**]{.underline} more [suited to a **first strike**]{.underline}
should there be a need to shift policies.

[Pakistan]{.underline}, however, does not have a no first use policy and
has [insisted on its right to employ **nuclear weapons** to defend
itself even in the face of **purely conventional** threat]{.underline}.
Pakistani [officials]{.underline} have, in the past, [[specifically
cited this
policy](https://www.cfr.org/event/promoting-us-pakistan-relations-future-challenges-and-opportunities) as
way of **deterring India**, which has a]{.underline} much
[larger]{.underline} and in some cases more advanced [conventional
force]{.underline}, and preventing larger wars.

The concern, then, is that [this policy appears to have
failed]{.underline}, at least to some degree, [with **India\'s strike**
on undisputed **Pakistani territory**]{.underline} on Feb. 26, 2019.
India, however, did not target Pakistani forces in that instance and
exchanges between the two countries have been limited, at least so far,
to the disputed [Jammu and Kashmir]{.underline} region, where
violent [skirmishes occur **semi-regularly**]{.underline} without
precipitating a larger confrontation.

[We can only hope]{.underline} that [the two countries]{.underline} will
[find a diplomatic solution]{.underline} to this latest conflict [and
avoid any]{.underline} further [escalation. If things]{.underline} were
to [**spiral out of control** and lead to]{.underline} the use of
[**nuclear weapons**, it would]{.underline} be something that would
[[threaten **all of humanity**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

two levels of redundancy, and so on.

#### NATO is resilient -- military relations are distinct from politics

**Baron 18** \[Kevin, founding executive editor of Defense One, \"NATO
Will Outlive Trump (and Putin), Don't Worry,\" Jun 27,
https://www.defenseone.com/politics/2018/06/nato-will-outlive-trump-and-putin-dont-worry/149348/\]

Before Trump heads back to Europe, remember that NATO isn't the G-7 and
military relations are much stronger than the political ones they often
endure. Squee! What is Trump going to say this time? That's how some of
the political press in DC sound already, both giddy and worried about
what President Donald Trump is going to say at the NATO Summit in two
weeks. More seriously, many Americans and Europeans are worried about
what Trump is going to say and do in Brussels, and how much further
Trump may sink U.S. relations in general with European and North
American allies. You can't blame them. The G-7 meeting in Canada last
month was a diplomatic disaster that left foreign policy pundit circles
aghast yet again at how the American president treated the leaders of
his nation's closest allies. (Trump supporters loved every minute of
it.) Even before that meeting, Foreign Policy had run an article
headlined "Can the U.S.-Europe Alliance Survive Trump?" (They were
talking about Trump pulling the U.S. out of the Iran deal.) After
Vancouver, other headlines proclaimed U.S.-European relations at an
all-time low. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel said Europe could no
longer "completely rely" on American protection, leading many to
question the future of the alliance. There's only one problem, or
perhaps ray of hope. Relations between G-7 leaders are not the same as
relations between their countries. And the G-7 is not NATO. NATO is not
political Twitter or a TV roundtable. It's not an economic club[. [NATO
is a military alliance of treaty-bound governments]{.mark} with troops
trained to kill, fight, and die to protect one another from foreign
attack. [NATO]{.mark} is a 70-year-old alliance that [has withstood
political winds and]{.mark} Cold War [nuclear showdowns]{.mark}. It is a
pact between democratic nations t]{.underline}hat their military men and
women will stand that post. [It outlasted Kennedy and
Kruschev]{.underline}, Brezhnev and Reagan. [[It will outlast Trump and
Putin and Merk]{.underline}el]{.mark}. [[Military relations are not like
political ones]{.underline}.]{.mark} Take Turkey. Defense One ran the
headline "Are U.S.-Turkey Relations Fraying?" five years ago. They are.
Last week, they were "coming to a boil." But what is happening
underneath? Military leaders in constant contact, still upholding their
NATO pledge. Earlier this year, I was talking with one senior military
official who said he understood every American concern about President
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's confounding moves in Syria and toward Russia, but
he put it like this: military-to-military relations do and must operate
on a level plane at one level (as he steadily slid his hand flat in the
air, back and forth), while political relations and the sometimes-heated
rhetoric of elected officials who come and go occur above them (he
raised his hand above his eyes, making the same gesture). It's true in
many places. If military relations sour between the U.S. and China, it
is potentially far more disastrous than any downturn in the economic,
political, or trade spheres. But even when those relations are not so
great, they're often steady. In the early Obama years, when China froze
communications with the U.S. military, Pentagon leaders begged the PLA
to open up and talk, saying repeatedly that the U.S. wanted both sides
to "avoid miscalculations" that could escalate into war. China opened
up, but they also proceeded with a rapid military technological advance
and created new islands to expand their power. Military relations
adjusted, but they continue. At press time, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis
is in Beijing discussing mutual issues like North Korean
denuclearization. Or take Israel. Conservatives, liberals, and
pro-Israeli and political pundits claimed U.S.-Israeli relations were at
an all-time low when Obama and Netanyahu weren't seeing eye-to-eye. But
at the same moment, military and intelligence leaders of both sides were
saying times were never better at their level; as mutual trust,
intelligence coordination, and arms sales were flourishing. [[The
relationships of national leaders do not]{.mark} always [reflect the
relationships of]{.mark} their peoples or [militaries. So when you hear
predictions that]{.mark} in two weeks [Trump may pull]{.mark} the U.S.
[out of NATO, take a breath]{.mark} and think through what it would
really take for that to happen.]{.underline} Think about the military.
When Syria's Bashar al-Assad was routing rebels and some U.S. leaders
wanted Obama to intervene with bombs and troops, there was one group
left out of the conversation who also had a vote: the military. At the
time, Defense One ran the headline "Want Syria? Convince General
Dempsey." The point was that as right-left politics shouted at each
other over what to do, Obama's senior military advisor was sitting atop
an officer corps that was extremely wary of leading the U.S. into
another unsure military intervention in the Middle East just two years
after pulling out of Iraq. Now think about the magnitude of a U.S.
withdrawal from NATO. Trump so far has deferred to the generals
repeatedly --- on Syria, on Afghanistan, on Guantanamo, on North Korea,
and, yes, on NATO. Do you really think Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph
Dunford's "best military advice" to the commander in chief at this
moment in history would be to pull out of NATO? Would any U.S. military
leader's? Would John Kelly's? Would Congress's? Of course not. We've
been through this before. Trump has been dangling NATO withdrawal (or
cheap disparagement) before his isolationist-but-militaristic base since
early in his presidential campaign. And Trump may continue to dangle it
over Europeans, the way he dangles tweets and falsehoods to manipulate
his constituency, the media, and his opponents. We know that game now.
Some of the NATO leaders he is going to meet in July know it more than
most. They were the ones he humiliated at the G-7. The G-7 isn't NATO.
[NATO will survive July.]{.underline} But politics is politics, and now
we have a new concern. John Bolton, Trump's still-new national security
advisor, flew to Moscow and received Russian President Vladimir Putin's
assent to a meeting of the two leaders. That's expected sometime in
July, in Europe, around the time that Trump will be across the pond for
the NATO Summit, the president said. "It would look like we will
probably be meeting in the not too distant future and I've said it from
day one getting along with Russia and China and with everybody is a very
good thing," Trump said Wednesday. Forget Bolton. The Trump-Putin
meeting has foreign-policy pundits worried as much as when the president
met North Korea's Kim Jong-Un. Nobody knows what to expect from Trump.
But there's plenty of reason for concern. Already, the Trump-Putin
meeting is left-right meat for partisans and political gamers. If you
hate Trump, you hate the idea of Trump stepping over NATO and falling
into Putin's trap, and you think the outcome will be Trump getting
played yet again by the master former-KGB autocrat whom nobody has yet
to best. After all, if Trump halted military exercises for Kim, what
will he give away to Putin? Crimea? Exercises? Nuclear stockpiles?
Missile defenses? NATO? If you like Trump, you welcome the chance for
the master dealmaker, the outsider, to toss out the diplomatic rulebook
as in Singapore, give Putin an extra-tight manly handshake and get him
on the hook to avoid a new Cold War, put an end to all this nonsense of
so-called Russian interference. Either way, you're not talking about
NATO anymore. You're talking about Trump. It's a pickle. [[The data
shows the United States has done nothing to back down from defending
Europe]{.mark}.]{.underline} Trump's insistence that NATO's European
members spend more on their own militaries is not a withdrawal, it is an
overdue and purposefully undiplomatic attempt to level an imbalance.
Merkel's statement that Europe cannot "completely rely" on American and
British support anymore is a reflection of what Trump and many American
leaders have been saying for years. Europe shouldn't. But while the new
era sorts itself out at the political level, there's been no backing
away from NATO between militaries. [[We have seen more]{.mark}, not
less, of U.S. and [NATO-allied military exercises, troop
deployments]{.mark} and rotations, [forward-located firepower, and
political attention to Europe's eastern flank. Military relations
go]{.mark} on.]{.underline} "In the last few weeks \[there has\] been a
lot of talk about, 'Well is the North Atlantic bond still a bond? Is it
still an alliance?' Yes, the answer is yes. We are," said U.S.
Ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchinson this month in Washington[.
["America is committed to NATO]{.mark}, to Article 5, I promise you we
really are, and the president has said it publicly many times,"
s]{.underline}he continued. "I think **[[our
allies]{.underline}]{.mark}** and our partners [**[know that]{.mark},**
but we can never say it too many]{.underline} times." There's no telling
what Trump will say in the coming weeks around the NATO Summit. It will
be a another leadership test for Merkel, UK's Theresa May, France's
Emmanuel Macron, and Canada's Justin Trudeau. No matter what they say,
the press will eat it up. Except none of it matters much to NATO.

While the United States' announcement that it would contribute its
capabilities could help lend credibility to NATO's cyber deterrence,
further [[clarification is needed]{.mark} within NATO, particularly
[when it comes to]{.mark} its [**command structure** in]{.mark}

NATO, the center aims to "strengthen cyber defenses and integrate cyber

declaration on its potential cyber support to NATO confirms, it appears
at this point that the center will serve to coordinate rather than
oversee operations. [[This, **coupled**]{.underline}
[with]{.underline}]{.mark} [allies' [**unwillingness** to **share

Political Policy and Institutional Arrangements

The fact that a given cyber threat or incident crosses the threshold of
political concern is without prejudice to its political and legal
characterisation for the purpose of developing an appropriate response.
Much will depend on political policy perceptions -- are cyber threats
and incidents predominantly perceived as human rights (i.e. data
privacy) issues, matters of law enforcement and/or homeland security300,
or matter of national security and defence -- and the different roles
played by the government agencies involved on the examination and
assessment of cyber threats and incidents, and competent to adopt or
contribute to actual responses. Accordingly, [it may be [for **multiple
reasons**]{.mark} that [NATO faces **challenges**]{.mark} in
[**developing consensus** regarding]{.mark}]{.underline} the full
integration of [[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} security and
[defence]{.underline} in its respective mechanisms, as well as the
necessary institutional arrangements.

[First, in an environment where any security and defence discourse is to
a great extent **predetermined** by the **level of political concern**,
there may simply have **be**en a **limited number of opportunities** to
actually put cyber security and defence **prominently** on NATO\'s
agenda. Second, quite similar to threats arising from international
**terrorism**, threats arising in and out of the [cyber]{.mark} space
may give rise to both internal, or homeland, and external security
concerns, and thus [trigger]{.mark} the oftentimes [**complex
delineations** of **competence** between]{.mark} the [**defence**, **law
enforcement**, and **intel**]{.mark}ligence sectors [which many]{.mark}
NATO [Nations have]{.mark} developed into **[strong checks]{.mark} and
balances** [amounting to]{.mark} a **[s]{.mark}eparation [o]{.mark}f
[p]{.mark}owers** [*en miniature* within their executive
branches]{.mark} of government. Whilst obviously such **[domestic
arrangements]{.mark}** lack the capacity to affect the interpretation
and application of the **N**]{.underline}orth **[A]{.underline}**tlantic
**[T]{.underline}**reaty301, [they may nevertheless **[*de facto*
challenge]{.mark}** NATO Nations\' Defence [Ministries\']{.mark} as well
as Armed Forces\' [**ability** to put cyber]{.mark} security and defence
[on NATO\'s]{.mark} policy, concept, and doctrine [agendas]{.mark}. To
date, [no]{.mark} well-entrenched [method]{.mark}, structure or process
[for overcoming this]{.mark} *de facto* challenge]{.underline} -- e.g.
through involvement of foreign intelligence, homeland security and/or
law enforcement stakeholders -- [[exists]{.mark} within NATO. Third,
there is a **near complete lack** of NATO-wide, standardised doctrine
for cyber warfare. The resulting **absence**]{.underline}, amongst NATO
Nations, [of a militarily agreed and legally cleared]{.underline}
(Article 36 of GP I) [understanding concerning the means and methods of
cyber warfare may also contribute to the **lack of political policy
consensus**]{.underline}. The appetite for engaging in hostilities which
might be perceived as potentially involving legally doubtful means and
methods of warfare may be limited. [Ultimately, the **[absence of
consensus]{.mark}** regarding *jus [in bello]{.mark}* may thus [have
**repercussions** on]{.mark} the **[likelihood]{.mark}** that
[**consensus can be reached** concerning]{.mark} *jus ad bellum* as well
as [collective]{.mark} security and [defence]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[NATO]{.mark} needs [to take a **hard look** at]{.mark}
itself]{.underline}. Across twenty-five indicators of
[democracy]{.underline} rated by Freedom House, the **[downward
trend]{.underline}** among NATO allies over the past decade [is
**stark**]{.underline}.35 [Especially in **Central Europe**]{.underline}
but not exclusively, there are setbacks in the media, the judiciary and
the functioning of national democratic institutions. The rate at which
[democracy is declining in **Poland**, **Hungary** and
**[Turkey]{.mark}**]{.underline} is particularly alarming. In 2017 and
2018, these three states' scores represented some of the largest
one-year declines in political rights and civil liberties of all 195
countries ranked by Freedom House.36 Poland---with the largest category
declines in the forty-year history of the survey---is close to leaving
the "consolidated democracy" category.37 Hungary is no longer rated a
consolidated democracy. Turkey, whose decline in freedom over the last
ten years represents the largest of any country in the world, crossed
the threshold from "free" to "not free."38

While less severe today, [nationalist **[populism]{.mark}**
movements]{.underline} in other allies [represent a broader, more
diffuse threat to NATO and can **[amplify]{.mark} other
[challenges]{.mark}** facing the Alliance]{.underline}. The United
States is not immune, with its Freedom House rating declining in 2018
due to "Russian interference in the 2016 election, violations of basic
ethical standards by the new administration and a reduction in
government transparency."39 While this slippage in the U.S. is
relatively recent and still minor in scale, it nonetheless diminishes
America's standing as a standard-bearer for democracy and further erodes
its leadership position within the Alliance. Further, anti-democratic
policies among allies open vulnerabilities for interference by
competitors outside the Alliance, especially Russia that seeks to divide
NATO and the EU politically using hybrid tactics.40

The question for allies is what must the role of the Alliance be in
reinforcing its core values when they are under assault from within.
NATO is both a political and a military alliance. It is not enough to be
bound together by a commitment only to Article 5 collective defense. The
values in the Treaty and the adherence of NATO allies to those values is
fundamental for Alliance cohesion. That shared commitment to values in
turn makes credible the Article 5 commitment. The Washington Treaty is
binding for both its political and military commitments.41 Allies cannot
ignore the failure to abide by political commitments including values
and expect military commitments to be unaffected. In short, NATO allies
should not expect that they could violate democratic values without
consequences, while resting assured that NATO cohesion is intact and
other commitments in the Treaty will be upheld. The Treaty is not a menu
of options from which allies can select some obligations while ignoring
others.

The NATO Treaty has no provision for policing members that drift from
common political values, unlike the European Union Treaty's Chapter 7
that has been invoked recently toward several EU member states with some
success.42 While it would be impossible to achieve consensus to impose
penalties on wayward allies, given that the ally in question could veto
any penalties, a range of escalating political initiatives on the part
of the Secretary General and a coalition of the other allies could
assert pressure. As a start, the Secretary General should express
concern in his bilateral meetings with the anti-democratic governments,
with the support of key allies and in partnership with the European
Union. To increase awareness within the Alliance and among the public,
foreign ministers could review annually indicators of democracy for all
twenty-nine allies, perhaps prepared by an informal high-level group of
experts drawing on Freedom House data. The NATO Parliamentary Assembly
and coalitions of allies can amplify the message.43 To increase
pressure, NATO could suspend hosting of visits, official meetings and
even military exercises with these nations. In severe cases, NATO
infrastructure spending and even access to military schools and
information sharing could be affected. An indirect way to express
concern among allies is to increase the prominence of core democratic
values when considering NATO enlargement decisions in the future.44 None
of these steps is without political cost and risk, even if calibrated
carefully. But the costs and risks of the gradual erosion of Alliance
cohesion as member states drift from the founding values are even
greater. NATO cannot expect to remain coherent and relevant and able to
address the full range of challenges it faces, if it ignores the
internal drift from democracy within some member states. This drift is a
fundamental issue for the Alliance.45

Streamlining NATO Decision-Making

Finally, the challenges facing NATO today demand more flexibility in
executive decision-making. As a core principle in preserving NATO
cohesion, consensus decision-making must remain the basis for major NATO
actions.46 [The Treaty requirements for **consensus** on]{.underline}
collective defense decisions [(Article 5)]{.underline} and enlargement
decisions (Article 10) [remain sensible]{.underline}. Major policy
decisions like the Defense Investment Pledge or the creation of the Very
High Readiness Joint Task Force rapid reaction capabilities require
consensus. [But today with NATO **enlarged** to **twenty-nine** members
and facing increasingly **diverse** and **complex** challenges, it is
time to **consider**]{.underline} how other, more routine,
administrative decisions can be taken more efficiently. But this should
be a management function, not derogation from the consensus principle.

We recommend strengthening the Secretary General's role as the chief
executive of the Alliance with broader authority to carry out routine
business without seeking consensus among the twenty-nine members. For
example, the Secretary General should consult allies on matters such as
agendas and timings of Ministerial Council meetings, but not be required
to seek consensus agreement. Today the agenda and even the dates of a
Foreign Minister meeting or a NATO-Russia Council meeting can consume
hours of formal Council time seeking consensus at the ambassadorial
level, consuming headquarters' bandwidth and crowding out more
substantive and urgent topics, including many outlined in this paper.
Further, the Secretary General's flexibility on international staff
personnel changes and NATO budget matters should be increased. Today,
for example, the Secretary General is severely constrained from adapting
the Alliance to emerging challenges by making meaningful shifts in
personnel and budgetary resources.47 While nations will continue to want
a critical role in all these decisions, criteria should be developed
that will provide for more flexibility while ensuring that all allies
gain a fair share of opportunities and allocation of resources.

[[A related problem is]{.mark} the [tendency of]{.mark}]{.underline}
some [[allies to **bring into** the Alliance **bilateral issues** that
**impede progress** on collective issues]{.mark} of the Alliance. As an
example, [an ally]{.mark} might [**hold up agreement** on the
**entire**]{.mark} NATO]{.underline} military exercise [[program because
of an **unrelated**]{.mark} **bilateral [dispute]{.mark}** [with
a]{.mark} **NATO [partner]{.mark}**]{.underline} who wishes to
participate in an exercise.48 [[This]{.mark} practice **[erodes]{.mark}
Alliance [cohesion]{.mark}**]{.underline} and should not be permitted.
After appropriate consultation, we recommend the Secretary General
should have the authority to exclude such external issues from
consideration in the Alliance, even if it means moving forward without
full consensus.

#### Greece and Turkey will bring up the [Aegean]{.underline}\-\--[neither]{.underline} will back down

[[Tensions between Greece and]{.underline}]{.mark} its neighbor,
[[Turkey]{.mark}, are nothing new. Conflict [in the **Aegean**
extends]{.mark} back [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the days of
**[[Homer]{.underline}]{.mark}**, who described how a Greek army
decimated the town of Troy, located near Hisarlik in Turkey. [The
animosity between these nations may date centuries into the past,
[but]{.mark} the weapons and [tactics used]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
conflict today [[are]{.mark} cutting edge **[cyber]{.mark}**
tools]{.underline}.

[Greece and Turkey are [now]{.mark} engaged [in a **diplomatic
conflict**]{.mark} focused on]{.underline} the maritime boundaries
surrounding the Greek island of [Crete]{.underline}. The row comes after
Turkey and the Libyan government agreed to seek to map out a boundary
that would potentially reduce Greece's maritime territory.
[[This]{.mark} conflict [raises **patriotic tensions**]{.mark} on both
sides]{.underline}, some of [which have become [manifest in
**cyber**]{.mark}space]{.underline}.

[[Turkish hackers]{.underline}]{.mark} last week [[claimed
responsibility for]{.mark} cyber [attacks on Greek]{.mark} government
[sites]{.mark}]{.underline}, including those of the Greek National
Intelligence Services (EYP), Greek Parliament, the Greek Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and the Greek Ministry of Finance among others. Turkish
hackers AnkaNeferler said these were in retaliation for the Greek
government's stance on the Turkish agreement with Libya (the Turkish
government is providing military support and plans to send its military
troops).

Meanwhile, [[Greece is **furious**]{.underline}]{.mark} at the pact
between Turkey and Sarraj's government as it threatens to skim the Greek
island of Crete, which Greece and its allies say is contrary to
international law.

[When [**Greece** and **Turkey**]{.mark} joined NATO in 1952, they did
so based on NATO members' assumption that the two countries' membership
of the alliance would pacify their behavior toward each
other]{.underline}.

China was invited to join the World Trade Organization in 2001 on the
same premise.

But [[as every relationship counselor tells **quarreling couples**, you
can't]{.mark} change someone's [personality]{.mark}. Thus, NATO finds
itself with two member states that are [officially allies, but]{.mark}
whose **[suspicion]{.mark}** of each other [is **never far**]{.mark}
from the surface]{.underline}. How to broker between two members without
taking sides? NATO seems \[gridlocked\] paralyzed.

But in reality, it's not. Sure, two quarreling member states will affect
an alliance, but NATO is still going strong on its main mission:
defending the territorial integrity of its member states against sundry
territorial threats from other countries and nonstate actors.

Here, one could in fact wish for more participation from Greece and
Turkey. According to NATO's latest Enhanced Forward Presence figures,
for example, neither country contributes to the protection of the Baltic
states and Poland. Solidarity goes both ways.

NATO's purpose as an organization is to ensure the collective defense of

Aggressive Stance on Cyber Weapons", Foreign Policy, 12/7/2017,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/12/07/natos-little-noticed-but-important-new-aggressive-stance-on-cyber-weapons/

[**Not many** people **noticed**]{.underline} it, [but **last month**,
[NATO made a **dramatic change**]{.mark} in its cyber
policy]{.underline} announced by the NATO Secretary General that
arguably was [[the]{.mark} alliance's **[biggest]{.mark} overall policy
[shift]{.mark}** [in **decades**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Having led the
policy discussions in several NATO committees for the past four years on
the use of cyber capabilities and **[[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}**
weapons, I can tell you this [[was]{.mark} the most **[hotly
debated]{.mark}** and **contentious** decision]{.underline} during my
tenure at NATO.

[In short, [NATO **embraced**]{.mark} **the [use]{.mark}** of cyber
weaponry in NATO operations. This is a **marked departure** from NATO's
historical stance of using cyber only defensively]{.underline}, mainly
to ward off incursions against its own networks. The more aggressive
approach was [intended as a **strong message**]{.underline}, primarily
[to Russia, that NATO intends to]{.underline} use the cyber capabilities
of its members to **[deter]{.underline}** attacks in the same way it
uses land, sea, and air weaponry.

[[Russia's]{.mark} **provocative [actions]{.mark}** [during]{.mark} the
**[U.S.]{.mark} Presidential elections**, its attempts to influence the
[**French** and **German** elections, and]{.mark} its blatantly
aggressive, and on-going cyberwar against [**Ukraine** were]{.mark}
likely **[key]{.mark} determining factors** which led the NATO defense
ministers to adopt a **more assertive** stance.]{.underline}

On the surface, NATO's cyber policy shifts might seem to be little more
than incremental changes to its existing policy. [However, the fact the
alliance is standing up a cyber operations center to integrate cyber
capabilities from alliance members **sends a message** to the
world]{.underline}, especially Russia, that alliance members both
possess and have the will to use their cyber capabilities and weaponry
during military operations.

Formulating clear doctrines is frequently preferred by militaries, while
politicians and diplomats prefer flexibility in message and response.
[The Alliance has **two paths**]{.underline} it can chose in creating
the doctrine regarding cyber. [It can either chose [a **public
approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}, rather similar to its approach when
creating its most recent strategic concept. [In such a document it
[could]{.mark} generally describe what constitutes an attack that would
[qualify]{.mark} for the [invocation of Article 5]{.mark}]{.underline},
and what would be an accepted retaliatory action. [The **other path** is
to **maintain strategic ambiguity**, recognizing that **formulating
clear redlines** would **invite potential adversaries** to **push up to
the red line**. In this case developing the doctrine is **still
important**, but would then be **for internal use only**]{.underline}.
This non-public approach may reduce the objective of improving the
Alliance´s cyber deterrence. [The **[pace of development]{.mark}** in
the field would [argue **against**]{.mark} an **[overly specific]{.mark}
set of [guidelines]{.mark}** or **doctrine**, [lest it require **too

### Say No\-\--Allies\-\--Game Theory\-\--2NC

#### Allies [misrepresent]{.underline} their [actual]{.underline} preference to gain [leverage]{.underline}, but [overshoot]{.underline}, producing [gridlock]{.underline}

[[During bargaining, alliance members]{.mark} interact and
**[communicate]{.mark} their [demands]{.mark}** [for **future security
coop**]{.mark}**eration**]{.underline}. [Allies not only try to
determine a set of mutually acceptable solutions, but also evaluate
whether the alliance is worth preserving.]{.underline} In the attempt to
find a solution to their differences, [members may encounter
difficulties during negotiation, since their [interests]{.mark} are
[**unlikely** to overlap]{.mark} completely.]{.underline}

Morrow (1994) suggests that two problems may hinder coordination in
alliance politics. [First, a distributional problem occurs when members
have different preferences among all available solutions]{.underline}.
[The other problem is **informational problem**]{.underline}. [Allies
may conceal available options from each other in order to advance their
own interests]{.underline}. These two problems intertwine. As Morrow
argues, "Distributional interests prevent the honest sharing of
information." This dictum applies to intra-alliance bargaining because,
even in a security alliance, members are not fully aware of each other's
intentions. Members sometimes have an incentive to misrepresent or hide
their true intent in terms of maximizing their own security benefit, and
so may withhold information regarding their security interests or
falling short of their commitments in order to achieve unexpressed
policy goals.

[These distributional and informational problems give rise to three
predicaments during intra-alliance bargaining: alliance members
may]{.underline} (1) [be]{.underline} **[unaware]{.underline}** [that
they have an interest divergence;]{.underline} (2) [acknowledge the
existence of interest divergence, but be uncertain about a mutually
acceptable solution;]{.underline} [or]{.underline} (3) [be unsure
whether other members will **keep their commitments** in the
future.]{.underline}

To overcome these difficulties, allies rely on information revealed
during intraalliance bargaining when deciding on the future of an
alliance. First, both sides need to recognize the existence of interest
divergence and the need for a solution. Bargaining needs to focus on
clarifying the problem when one or more partners fail even to see it,
and sometimes this act of clarification can in fact be the most
difficult discussion involved in bargaining.

Second, if both members recognize the interest divergence, they can move
on to negotiate an arrangement. [Successful bargaining requires **allies
to agree** on one among a set of mutually acceptable options. [A
**distributional problem**]{.mark} may [occur]{.mark}, however, when
[allies have **uncertainties** regarding]{.mark} each other's
**[updated]{.mark} security [interests]{.mark}** and hence regarding
what arrangements might satisfy these interests]{.underline}. [Dialogue
can clarify matters, but [a member may become **suspicious**
about]{.mark} the [claims]{.mark} that an ally makes if these claims
**differ from its own reading** of the situation. Since an alliance
relationship allows allies to interact more frequently, each ally is
confident of its own understanding of the evolving security needs of its
partners. [When]{.mark} there is [a **perception gap**]{.mark} among
members concerning the security benefit that one or another enjoys or
about the kind of cooperation that best furthers the alliance's common
interests, [agreement may be **difficult**]{.mark} to
reach]{.underline}. Allies must genuinely communicate their own
preferences and be able to verify each other's claims.

Finally, members naturally want to know the extent to which the other
members value and are committed to the alliance. When their security
interests have changed, [they will not agree to negotiate **unless**
they still **consider each other reliable**]{.underline}. [When members
agree to revise a treaty, a major goal is to ensure that any new
obligations will **induce sustained cooperation**. An alliance will soon
**fall apart** if bargaining reveals that a member has no interest in
maintaining]{.underline} [it.]{.underline}

When allies are consistently candid during renegotiation, their
differences are likely to be resolved. However, as mentioned in the
context of studies of burden sharing, [allies have incentives to take
advantage of their partners that are founded on the assumption that the
interests of the latter in maintaining the alliance will lead them to
grant concessions during negotiations as a means to salvage the
imperiled relationship.]{.underline} In other words, [some members may
enter into renegotiation with the **belief** that abrogation would be
**too costly** for the other members]{.underline}. In addition, [an
uncommitted partner is **unlikely** to **engage** in negotiation and
more likely simply to **abandon the alliance immediately**]{.underline}.
A member that is willing to renegotiate, by contrast, still values and
therefore seeks to preserve the alliance. [[Each]{.mark} member thus
[starts bargaining under the assumption]{.mark} that the [others are
**unlikely to give up**]{.mark} easily, a situation [that leaves
rooms]{.mark} for allies [to **misrepresent**]{.mark} **their [security
interests]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} levels of
**[commitment]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Even in an alliance relationship, a member's commitment to the alliance
is private information. Both the **[challenger and]{.mark} the
[partner]{.mark}** [have]{.mark} an [incentive to
**misrepresent**]{.mark} their true **[intent]{.mark}**ions [in]{.mark}
the [pursuit of **leverage**]{.mark} during bargaining. Expressing
discontent may gain concessions from other allies as well as testing the
loyalty of each]{.underline}. A challenger may, in the course of
renegotiation, threaten to withdraw from the alliance when it is in fact
willing to accept an arrangement; a partner may misjudge a challenger's
resolve and fail to accommodate its needs; a challenger may misperceive
its partner as dissatisfied and decide to withdraw from the alliance
preemptively. Therefore, even though intra-alliance bargaining stands a
good chance, and may represent the only chance, of resolving
disagreement among members, there is no guarantee that this process will
succeed.

The current 'cyber warfare playbook' is still a slim volume - but it is
growing by the day. In order to remain a credible defence alliance,
[NATO must possess a credible cyber policy]{.underline}, including cyber
deterrence. Credibility comes from a largely similar set of actions as
NATO has engaged in regarding conventional military. Doing it in the
cyber domain is, however, harder at the moment. For example, what is the
equivalent of standing up in practice permanent battalions in member
states? How do you exercise, publicly message determination to defend
and counter aggression, in a serious but non-threatening way?

**[NATO]{.underline}** [has to find a clear way to deal with a '**Cyber

Article 5 and an armed attack constitute in today´s world.

\"China Doesn't Pose an Existential Threat for America,\"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/04/21/china-existential-threat-america/\]

There is no doubt that [Beijing's behavior]{.underline} in many areas
[challenges existing U.S. and allied interests and democratic
values]{.underline}. Particularly under Xi Jinping, [China has used
its]{.underline} greater [**economic** and **military
power**]{.underline} [to intimidate rival claimants in **territorial
disputes** and punish nations]{.underline} that make statements or take
what [Beijing views as threatening]{.underline} or insulting actions. It
has engaged in extensive commercial hacking and theft of technologies
and favors military intimidation over dialogue in dealing with Taiwan.
And it has employed draconian, repressive policies in Tibet and Xinjiang
and suppressed democratic freedoms in Hong Kong.

[This deeply **troubling behavior** certainly requires a strong,
concerted response]{.underline} from the United States and other
nations. [But to be effective, such a response also requires an
**accurate assessment** of China's **future impact** on the **U**nited
**S**tates and the world]{.underline}.

[And in this regard, [it is]{.mark} extremely
**[counterproductive]{.mark}** to U.S. interests [to]{.mark} assert or
even [imply]{.mark}]{.underline}, as many now do, [that the above
[Chinese actions constitute]{.mark} an all-of-society, **[existential
threat]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the United States, the West, and
ultimately the entire world, [thereby justifying a Cold War-style,
zero-sum containment stance]{.underline} toward Beijing. Such an extreme
stance stifles debate and the search for more positive-sum policy
outcomes while leading to the usual calls for major increases in defense
spending.

[In fact, [there isn't]{.mark} much **actual [evidence]{.mark}** to
support the notion of China as an existential threat]{.underline}. That
does not mean that China is not a threat in some areas, but [Washington
needs to approach this issue based on the facts, not **dangerous
rhetoric**]{.underline}. Unfortunately, right-sizing the challenges that
China poses seems to be an impossible task for Washington.

In the most basic, literal sense, [an existential threat means a threat
to the physical existence]{.underline} of the nation through the
possession of an ability and intent to exterminate the U.S. population,
[presumably via the use of highly lethal **nuclear**, **chemical**, or
**biological weapons**]{.underline}. A [less conventional]{.underline}
understanding of the term [posits the **radical erosion** or ending of
U.S. **prosperity** and **freedoms**]{.underline} through economic,
political, ideational, and military pressure, thereby in essence
destroying the basis for the American way of life. [Any threats that
fall below these]{.underline} two definitions [do not
convey]{.underline} what is meant by the word
"**[existential]{.underline}**."

[As a **military power**, [China has **no ability to destroy** the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [without **destroying
itself**]{.mark}. China's [**nuclear capabilities** are **far
below**]{.mark} those of [the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates,
and [its **conventional military**]{.mark}, while
regionally]{.underline} potentially [powerful, [has a fraction of the
budget]{.mark}]{.underline} of that of the United States.

[Some argue that China could **militarily push** the **U**nited
**S**tates **out of Asia** and dominate that region]{.underline},
denying the country air and naval access and hence support for critical
allies. This would presumably have an existential impact by virtue of
the supposedly critical importance of that region to the stability and
prosperity of the United States. [Yet [there are **no signs**]{.mark}
that [Washington is losing]{.mark} either the [**will** or]{.mark} the
[**capacity** to remain a **major**]{.mark} **military [actor]{.mark}**
[in the region]{.mark}]{.underline} and one [closely connected to major
**Asian allies**, which are themselves opposed to China
dominating]{.underline} the region. In reality, [the greater
danger]{.underline} in Asia [is that Washington could]{.underline} so
[militarize its response]{.underline} to China that its actions and
policies become repugnant even to U.S. allies.

[This leaves the **[unconventional threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Here
they are [[presumably]{.mark} twofold: [**economic** and
**technological**]{.mark}, and in the realm of ideas and
influence]{.underline} operations [within the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} and other Western countries, [[including]{.mark}
the [**export** of China's]{.mark} so-called "[model]{.mark}" of
**authoritarian rule**]{.underline} to the rest of the world.

[The former threats]{.underline} would [presumably consist of China
attaining a level of **total superiority** over both economic and
technological levers]{.underline} of influence globally and with regard
to the United States (perhaps combined with a successful military
blocking of U.S. sea lines of communication) that would so impoverish
the country as to threaten its existence as a stable and prosperous
democracy and bring it under Chinese control. Presumably, [the specific
basis]{.underline} of such leverage [[would consist of]{.mark}
near-absolute [global]{.mark} Chinese [dominance over]{.mark} both
**[trade]{.mark}** and [**investment relations** and **supply
chains**]{.mark}]{.underline} with the United States and other countries
and over all the key technologies driving future growth and military
capabilities.

[It is **[virtually inconceivable]{.mark}** that China could achieve
such a **level of dominance** over the **U**nited **S**tates. [The
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [possesses]{.mark} abundant
[**energy**, **human**, **tech**]{.mark}**nological**, and other
[**resources**; a huge]{.mark} and dynamic **domestic
[market]{.mark}**[; enormous]{.mark} levels of **[accumulated
wealth]{.mark}** and **capital stocks**; [and the]{.mark} globe's
financial **[reserve currency]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In contrast, while [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} boasts a highly
entrepreneurial and dynamic workforce, it [[labors under]{.mark} major
**[structural]{.mark}** and **political [constraints]{.mark}** such as
[insufficient]{.mark} **arable [land]{.mark}**, a rapidly **[aging
society]{.mark}**, a heavy [reliance on]{.mark} **energy
[imports]{.mark}**[, and stifling]{.mark} ideological and
**[state]{.mark}-centered [controls]{.mark}** across
society]{.underline}.

[Beijing has]{.underline} certainly [used its economic
leverage]{.underline} (such as market access) [to pressure foreign
companies and governments]{.underline} to support Chinese policies or
stop what it regards as unacceptable behavior, e.g., regarding Taiwan.
While such economic coercion is by no means unique to China, it
certainly can erode freedom of speech, thus threatening one of
democracy's core principles. [But this hardly rises to the level of an
existential threat to American values, given both the **limited reach**
of Chinese economic power and the **countervailing** global **economic
power** and **political influence** of **democratic
states**]{.underline}.

#### China's [not]{.underline} a cyber threat.

Policy Initiative. Her research focuses primarily on cybersecurity and
China-U.S. defense relations. \["What Are China's Cyber Capabilities and
Intentions?" *Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,* 4-1-2019,

News stories on the cyber threat that China poses appear on a regular
basis. Most underscore a view that China is using cyber power to rise
and ultimately win global dominance, and that the Chinese government is
behind the scenes in many malicious cyber activities. Though many of the
allegations focus on the tension between China and the United States on
cyber espionage, [these [actions are **unlikely to cause armed
conflict**]{.mark} since almost all capable actors conduct cyber
espionage.]{.underline}

Suspicions of intentions and capabilities of cyber warfare, however,
could drag the US and China into arms races, and even hot wars, due to
the role cyber tools can play in military operations. Given the risks,
[it is necessary to examine China's views on cyber warfare from a
narrative that is different from what most readers are familiar
with.]{.underline}

CONTEXT FOR CHINA'S VIEWS ON CYBER WARFARE

China's academic discussion of cyber warfare started in the 1990s when
it was called "information warfare." Impressed by how the US military
benefited from the application of high technologies in the Gulf
War---and subsequent operations in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq---China
began to realize that there is no way to adequately defend itself
without following the changes in the forms of war in which high
technologies, mainly information technologies, play more critical roles.

In 1993, two years after the Gulf War, the Chinese military adjusted its
military strategic guideline which set "winning local wars in conditions
of modern technology, particularly high technology" as the basic aim of
preparations for military struggle (PMS). In 2004, one year after the
Iraq War, the military's PMS was changed to "winning local wars under
conditions of informationization." The basic understanding, as
elaborated in China's National Defense in 2004, is that
"informationization has become the key factor in enhancing the
warfighting capability of the armed forces."

The first time that the Chinese military publicly addressed cyber
warfare from a holistic point of view was in the 2013 version of "The
Science of Military Strategy"---a study by the Academy of Military
Science. It emphasized that cyberspace has become a new and essential
domain of military struggle in today's world. A similar tone appeared in
the 2015 Ministry of National Defense paper entitled "China's Military
Strategy."

While the latter document modified the basic point for PMS to "winning
informationized local wars," it also addressed cybersecurity for the
first time in an official military document. It defined cyberspace as a
"new pillar of economic and social development, and a new domain of
national security," and declared clearly that "China is confronted with
grave security threats to its cyber infrastructure" as "international
strategic competition in cyberspace has been turning increasingly
fiercer, quite a few countries are developing their cyber military
forces."

[Based on the above approach that China is taking to cyberspace and its
own national security, a few conclusions can be drawn. The first is that
[China has **not developed**]{.mark} its **[cyber capabilities in a
vacuum]{.mark}**. Rather, [they have **developed** them **as a
response** to]{.mark} the changing cyber warfare approaches and
practices of other countries, especially those of [the US]{.mark} and
Russia.]{.underline} The second is that the Chinese government's views
on cyber warfare are consistent with its military strategy, which is
modified according to the national security environment, domestic
situation, and activities of foreign militaries.

CORE AIMS OF CHINA'S CYBER WARFARE

Though there is no commonly accepted conception of cyber warfare, one
made by a RAND Corporation study is frequently quoted by Chinese
military analysts: cyber warfare is strategic warfare in the information
age, just as it was nuclear warfare in the 20th century. This definition
serves as the foundation to argue that cyber warfare has much broader
significance to national security and involves competition in areas
beyond the military, such as the economy, diplomacy, and social
development.

Again, China's Military Strategy describes the primary objectives of
cyber capabilities to include: "cyberspace situation awareness, cyber
defense, support for the country's endeavors in cyberspace, and
participation in international cyber cooperation." The strategy frames
these objectives within the aims of "stemming major cyber crises,
ensuring national network and information security, and maintaining
national security and social stability."

Of these objectives, an essential one is national security and social
stability. As shown by several incidents, such as the protests after
Iran's 2009 presidential election, the Arab Spring, as well as Occupy
Wall Street and the London Riots of 2011, social media plays a vital
role in helping to plan and carry out such protests and movements. [The
Chinese government's monitoring of the internet and social media is
based on its potential use as a platform to disseminate information that
could cause similar social unrest to spread, which could lead to
large-scale social and political instability.]{.underline}

[[Another essential objective]{.underline}]{.mark}, in common with all
states, [[is defending critical info]{.mark}rmation infrastructure.
China is more and more dependent on information networks in all aspects,
including in defense.]{.underline} Although it has a large-scale
technology industry and possesses the potential to compete with the US
in some, [[most of its]{.mark} core network [tech]{.mark}nologies and
key software and hardware [are provided by US
companies]{.mark}.]{.underline}

China uses the term "eight King Kongs" to describe the top internet
companies in its domestic supply chain: Apple, Cisco, Google, IBM,
Intel, Microsoft, Oracle, and Qualcomm. [Heavy dependence on these
companies' products makes it necessary to work towards developing the
domestic technology industry and its capabilities, and to thereby make
the country's internal internet infrastructure more secure. It also
makes [China]{.mark} believe that its [**primary mission in cyberspace**
is to **ensure info**]{.mark}**rmation [security]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[of critical areas, [which is]{.mark} inherently [**defensive** and
**non-destructive**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Many,]{.underline} including the US government, [have accused the
Chinese government and military of cyberattacks]{.underline} in which
intellectual property has been stolen. In this regard, there are several
distinctions to make clear. The first is between those cyberattacks that
aim to destroy, and cyber espionage for intelligence collection. The
second is to make clear those forms of cyber espionage that are related
to national security concerns and those for economic interests. And the
last is between malicious cyber activities that one government or
military should take responsibility for, and those that are attributed
to a government or military based on less-than-reliable key indicators
of where activities originate.

The implications of distinguishing clearly are great and there is a need
for far lengthier analyses and studies. Looking at the issue briefly,
most accusations levied at China are related to the latter distinction.
[Until today, there is **[no]{.mark} irrefutable
[evidence]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to show **[China has been involved in
cyberattacks that aim to destroy or have destroyed]{.mark}**. While
cyber espionage for national security concerns is a common action
conducted by most countries, cyber espionage for economic benefit is an
accusation continually made against the Chinese government and
military.]{.underline} However, [there are reports indicating a
**notable decline** in **commercial cyber espionage** allegedly
attributed to Chinese sources, at least in the first few months
following an agreement reached between]{.underline} Chinese President
[Xi]{.underline} Jinping [and]{.underline} US President Barack
[Obama]{.underline} in 2015.

The [overall **[defensive perspective]{.mark}** of the government
[is]{.mark} ultimately in [line with China's]{.mark} strategic
[guidelines and]{.mark} its understanding of the [general
characteristics of cyber warfare]{.mark}. China has consistently said
that it adheres to the strategic guideline of Active
Defense,]{.underline} as elaborated in the 2015 defense paper. [Guided
by these principles, the primary stated goal in cyber warfare is to
enhance defense capabilities]{.underline} in order to survive and
counter after suffering an offensive cyber strike.

Some observers may conclude that it is more worthwhile to invest
resources into cyber offense since cyberspace is offense-dominant.
However, [the [principle that the **best defense is**]{.mark} **a good
[offense]{.mark}** [is **not applicable in
cyberspace**]{.mark}.]{.underline} As argued by PLA Senior Colonel Li
Daguang, [after the first round of a cyberattack, the targeted side can
respond with a precise counter-attack as long as it has a strong
defense. The [attacker]{.mark} will then [**suffer unfavorable
outcomes** if its **defense is not good**]{.mark} **enough**. From this
perspective, [it is **wiser** to]{.mark} make efforts in
**[build]{.mark}ing [up a]{.mark}** strong]{.underline}
[**[defense]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

IS CHINA'S CYBER CAPABILITY AS FORMIDABLE AS IMAGINED?

As mentioned, [cyber warfare encompasses far more areas than the
military and intelligence gathering. It is therefore logical to measure
one country's cyber capability by a more comprehensive evaluation, which
at least includes:]{.underline} technological research and development
[(R&D) and innovation capabilities; information technology industry
companies; internet infrastructure scale; influences of internet
websites; internet diplomacy and foreign policy capabilities; cyber
military strength; and comprehensiveness of cyberspace strategy. If
evaluated **along all these criteria**, [**China's cyber power largely
lags** behind]{.mark} that of [the US]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Aside from China's disadvantages in critical technological
self-sufficiency as mentioned above, [it is not as advanced in other
aspects as well. According to the ICT Development Index (IDI), which is
based on 11 indicators to monitor and compare developments in
information and communication technology across countries, China
**respectively ranked 80th, 81st, and 82nd** among 176
states]{.underline} in 2017, 2016, and 2015.

Part of China's low influence on the global internet is due to the fact
that [its primary languages are not widely used on the
internet]{.underline} outside the country. Though there are a massive
number of Chinese speakers throughout the world, Chinese languages are
only used by 1.7 percent of all websites, while 53.9 percent use
English.

[[China's internet is]{.mark} also one of the most **[regularly
attacked]{.mark}**.]{.underline} According to a report published in
February 2019 by Beijing Knownsec Information Technology, [China
suffered the highest rate of distributed denial of service attacks
(DDOS) in the world in 2018---an average of over 800 million a day.
Scanning and backdoor intrusions made up the majority of the attacks and
about 97 percent were conducted by domestic hackers. However, a growing
percentage came from overseas, mostly from the US, South Korea, and
Japan.]{.underline} Among all the attacks originating overseas, [those
that targeted government and financial websites largely outnumbered
those on other targets.]{.underline}

Similar statistics can be found elsewhere. However, it is not the
intention here to describe how vulnerable China is, but to emphasize
that a more comprehensive and objective assessment of China's cyber
power is in urgent need. As Joseph Nye argued, [[**exaggerated fears**
about]{.mark} **growing [Chinese power]{.mark}** [can become a **cause
of conflict.** The same logic applies in cyberspace]{.mark}, especially
at a time when China-US bilateral relations are seeing sharp twists and
turns.]{.underline}

#### No US-China cyber conflict. 

**Thomas '16** (Elizabeth; 8/28/2016; professional cyberdefense expert;

Analysis,"

Date Accessed: 9/29/2016)

However, [a [cyber conflict between the US and China is]{.mark} highly
[unlikely]{.mark}. Examples of [attacks with]{.mark} destructive or
physical [consequence]{.mark}s [are]{.mark} still very
[rare]{.mark}]{.underline} (although the number may be increasing).
Since the late 1980s, there have been 61 attacks conducted by states
against during peacetime, and 24 during wartime.\[29\] Examples include
Russian attacks on Georgia in 2008 and the infamous Stuxnet attack on
Iranian nuclear infrastructure (usually attributed to the US and
Israel).\[30\] [No state has ever declared a
'cyberwar'.]{.underline}\[31\] This is partly because [[to develop
sophisticated attacks]{.mark} like Stuxnet [is]{.mark} very [difficult,
requiring]{.mark} high levels of [technical
expertise]{.mark}.]{.underline}\[32\] [Attribution is also notoriously
difficult in cyberspace. [It is]{.mark} extremely [tough to trace
attacks]{.mark} and states may also use proxy or non-state actors,
further confusing the issue]{.underline}.\[33\] Until recently, [the
failure to develop an effective deterrence policy has been related to
the difficulty in attributing cyberattacks. Nevertheless, [the
US]{.mark} has ["reserve\[d\]]{.mark} the right to use all necessary
means -- diplomatic, informational, military, and economic -- as
appropriate and consistent with applicable [international law" to
respond to hostile acts]{.mark} in cyberspace.]{.underline}\[34\]
[[China has not used 'force']{.mark} against the US in
cyberspace]{.underline} but it is clear that cyberattacks would feature
in any broader military clash. Difficulties arise in considering what
constitutes a proportionate response to low-level attacks like hacking
or cybercrime. [[It is]{.mark} very [unlikely that any incident]{.mark}
of that nature [could justify]{.mark} a traditional [military
response]{.mark}.]{.underline} \[35\] To date, countermeasures have
fallen well below the use of military force. [[The US has]{.mark}
instead [relied on diplomatic]{.mark} and law enforcement
[tools]{.mark}: attribution, indictments, [and]{.mark} the threat of
[sanctions.]{.mark}]{.underline}\[36\]

#### War won't occur -- it's not in the interest of either the US or China.

[[**Exaggerated fears** about the]{.underline}]{.mark} ~~paralysis~~
[[\[shutdown\] of]{.mark} digital [infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}
and growing concerns over competitive advantage
[[exacerbate]{.underline}]{.mark} the spiral of
[[mistrust]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Closer consideration of domestic
factors within China and China's strategic interaction with the United

situation.**]{.underline} This article argues that [[for

[Chinese cyber [threat]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [there
are]{.underline}]{.mark} also [**serious [Chinese
vulnerabilities]{.mark}** [and Western strengths]{.mark}]{.underline}
[that reinforce the]{.underline} political [status quo.
[Cyberwar]{.mark} between the United States and China]{.underline}, much
[[like]{.mark} U.S.-China [conventional war, is **highly
unlikely**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [the]{.underline}
economically driven [proliferation of information technology
enables]{.underline} numerous instances of [friction to emerge below the
threshold of violence]{.underline}. From a technical perspective, cyber
operations are often thought to be inexpensive and effective, but
[[there are]{.mark} underappreciated [institutional costs]{.mark}
involved in their employment]{.underline}. Moreover, [even if
[actors]{.mark} can overcome]{.underline} the [operational
barriers]{.underline} associated with ambitious cyber penetrations,
[they still [have incentives to moderate]{.mark} the intensity of [their
exploitation]{.mark}]{.underline} in order [to preserve the benefits
that make exploitation worthwhile]{.underline} in the first place.
[[This]{.mark} logic [culminates in]{.mark} a]{.underline} relentlessly
irritating but [**[indefinitely tolerable stability]{.mark}** in the
cyber domain]{.underline}. China and the United States can look forward
to chronic and ambiguous intelligence-counterintelligence contests
across their networks, even as the internet facilitates productive
exchange between them.

#### No liberal order collapse\-\--it's durable

Dr. G. John **Ikenberry 18**, Ph.D. in Political Science from the
University of Chicago, Milbank Professor of Politics and International
Affairs at Princeton University in the Department of Politics and the
Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, March 2018,
"Why the Liberal World Order Will Survive," Ethics and International
Affairs, Vol. 32, No. 1, p. 19-22

But does this vision of power transition truly illuminate the struggles
going on today over international order? Some might argue no---that [the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [is still in]{.mark} a
[position]{.mark}, despite its travails, [to provide]{.mark} hegemonic
[leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Here one would note that there is a
**[durable infrastructure]{.mark}**]{.underline} (or what Susan Strange
has called "structural power") [that [undergirds the existing]{.mark}
American-led [order]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Far-ﬂung [**security
alliances**, **market relations**, **liberal democratic
solidarity**]{.mark}, deeply rooted **[geopolitical
alignments]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[there [are]{.mark} many possible
[sources of American]{.mark} hegemonic [power]{.mark} that remain
intact]{.underline}. But [there may be even deeper sources of continuity
in the existing system]{.underline}. This would be true if the existence
of a liberal-oriented international order does not in fact require
hegemonic domination. It might be that the power transition theory is
wrong: [the stability and persistence of the existing post-war
international order does not depend on the concentration of American
power]{.underline}.

In fact, [international order is not simply an artifact of
concentrations of power]{.underline}. [The rules and institutions that
make up international order have a more complex and contingent
relationship with the rise and fall of state power.]{.underline} This is
true in two respects. First, [[international order]{.underline}]{.mark}
itself [[is]{.mark} complex: [multilayered]{.mark}, multifaceted, and
not simply a political formation imposed by the leading
state]{.underline}. International order is not "one thing" that states
either join or resist. [It is an aggregation of various sorts of
ordering rules and institutions. [There are]{.mark} the [deep rules and
norms]{.mark} of sovereignty. There are [governing institutions]{.mark},
starting with the **U**nited **N**ations]{.underline}. [There is a
[sprawling]{.mark} array of international institutions, regimes,
[treaties, agreements, protocols]{.mark}, and so forth]{.underline}.
[[These]{.mark} governing arrangements cut across diverse realms,
including security and arms control, the world economy, the environment
and global commons, human rights, and political relations.]{.underline}
Some of these domains of governance may have rules and institutions that
narrowly reﬂect the interests of the hegemonic state, but [most [reﬂect
**negotiated outcomes** based on]{.mark} a much [broader]{.mark} set of
[interests]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[As rising states continue to rise]{.underline}, they do not simply
confront an American-led order; [they face a wider conglomeration of
ordering rules, institutions, and arrangements; many of which they have
long embraced.]{.underline} [By separating "American hegemony" from "the
existing international order," we can see a more complex set of
relationships.]{.underline} [The **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[does not embody the international order; it has a
**relations**]{.mark}hip [with]{.mark} it]{.underline}, as do rising
states. [The **U**nited **S**tates embraces many of the core global
rules and institutions, such as the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[N]{.mark}**ations, International Monetary Fund [(IMF), World Bank,
and **W**]{.mark}orld **[T]{.mark}**rade
**[O]{.mark}**rganization.]{.underline} But it also has resisted
ratiﬁcation of the Law of the Sea Convention and the Convention on the
Rights of the Child (it being the only country not to have ratiﬁed the
latter) as well as various arms control and disarmament agreements.
China also embraces many of the same global rules and institutions, and
resists ratiﬁcation of others. Generally speaking, the more fundamental
or core the norms and institutions are---beginning with the Westphalian
norms of sovereignty and the United Nations system---the more agreement
there is between the United States and China as well as other states.
Disagreements are most salient where human rights and political
principles are in play, such as in the Responsibility to Protect.

Second, [there is also diversity in what rising states "want" from the
international order. The struggles over international order take many
different forms.]{.underline} [In some instances, what rising states
want is more inﬂuence and control of territory and geopolitical space
beyond their borders.]{.underline} One can see this in China's efforts
to expand its maritime and political inﬂuence in the South China Sea and
other neighboring areas. This is an age-old type of struggle captured in
realist accounts of security competition and geopolitical rivalry.
Another type of struggle is over the norms and values that are enshrined
in global governance rules and institutions. These may be about how open
and rule-based the system should be. They may also be about the way
human rights and political principles are deﬁned and brought to bear in
relations among states. Finally, [the struggles over international order
may be focused on the distribution of authority]{.underline}. That is,
rising states may seek a greater role in the governance of existing
institutions. This is a struggle over the position of states within the
global political hierarchy: voting shares, leadership rights, and
authority relations.

[These observations cut against the realist hegemonic perspective and
cyclical theories of power transition.]{.underline} [**[Rising states do
not confront a single]{.mark}, coherent, hegemonic [order]{.mark}**. The
international order offers a buffet of options and choices]{.underline}.
[They can embrace some rules and institutions and not
others]{.underline}. Moreover, stepping back, [the international orders
that rising states have faced in different historical eras have not all
been the same order]{.underline}. The British-led order that Germany
faced at the turn of the twentieth century is different from the
international order that China faces today. [The contemporary
[international order is]{.mark} much [more **complex**]{.mark} and
wide-ranging [than past orders]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It has a much
denser array of rules, institutions, and governance realms.]{.underline}
[[There are also]{.mark} both **[regional and global domains of
governance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This makes it hard to imagine an
epic moment when the international order goes into crisis and rising
states step forward]{.underline}---either China alone or rising states
as a bloc---[to reorganize and reshape its rules and
institutions]{.underline}. Rather than a cyclical dynamic of rise and
decline, [change in the existing American-led order might best be
captured by terms such as continuity, evolution, adaptation, and
negotiation.]{.underline} [The struggles over international order today
are growing, but it is not a drama best told in terms of the rise and
decline of American hegemony.]{.underline} [If the liberal international
order endures, it will be because it is **based on more than American
hegemonic order**.]{.underline} To be sure, [the **U**nited **S**tates
did give shape to a distinctive post-war liberal hegemonic system, and
many of its features]{.underline}--- [including the American-led
alliance system and multilateral economic governance
arrangements]{.underline}---[are themselves quite **durable**. But [the
broader features of the modern]{.mark} international [order are the
result of centuries of struggle]{.mark} over its organizing principles
and institutions]{.underline}. [Rising states face an international
order that is long in the making, one that presents these non-Western
developing states with opportunities as well as
constraints]{.underline}. The struggles over the existing international
order will reshape the rules and institutions in the existing system in
various ways. [But [rising states are not simply]{.mark} or primarily
"[revisionist]{.mark}" states seeking to overturn the
order]{.underline}; rather, [[they are seeking]{.mark} greater [access
and authority]{.mark} over its operation]{.underline}. Indeed, the order
creates as many safeguards and protections for rising states as it
creates obstacles and constraints. For example, the World Trade
Organization provides rules and mechanisms for rising states to dispute
trade discrimination and protect access to markets. After all, more
generally, it was this liberal-oriented international order---its
openness and rules---that provided the conditions for China and other
rising states to rise. Indeed, if the liberal international order
survives, it will be in large part due to the fact that the
constituencies for such an order that stretch across the Western and the
non-Western worlds are larger than the constituencies that oppose it. We
can look more closely at these sources of continuity and constituency.

#### No grey-zone escalation -- the entire strategy is [cautiously designed]{.underline} to avoid retaliation.

The detonation at the Trinity test site near Alamogordo, New Mexico in
mid-July of [**1945** marked the beginning of [the '**nuclear
age**]{.mark}]{.underline}'. Three weeks later, [the world
saw]{.underline} what the "Little Boy" and "Fat Man" were capable of
after they were dropped on the Japanese cities of [**Hiroshima** and
**Nagasaki**]{.underline}, respectively and the Hibakusha\[1\] are still
the proof of that. [This]{.underline} has [[increased
apprehension]{.mark} among countries [to]{.mark}wards engaging in
**traditional [war]{.mark}fare**, thus [making]{.mark} it inevitable for
**[revisionist powers]{.mark}** to [employ **alternative tactics** to
**challenge**]{.mark} the existing **world [order]{.mark}**
[without]{.mark} any **major [escalation]{.mark}**[. This is]{.mark}
where one can observe an increase in the use of [the **grey
zone**]{.mark} strategy, which is not]{.underline} a [novel]{.underline}
tactic [and has been present since centuries.]{.underline} However it
has reemerged, as the need of the hour in the present political climate
is unconventional stratagem. [It is [an **identifying strategy** in the
**nuclear age**]{.mark} which is [**resistant** of]{.mark} a [full
blown]{.mark} out [war. This]{.mark} strategic campaign [has
taken]{.mark} a [new form]{.mark} in the current age [with the aid of
**cyber**]{.mark} **weapons**]{.underline}, advanced information
technology and civilian tools allowing the increase in importance of the
tactic and applicability.

Understanding the Grey Zone Strategy

The new approach has been provided a fertile environment to flourish
with an increase in revisionist intent, strategic gradualism and
employability of unconventional tool. [The revisionist intent stems from
the fact that major powers may want to change the existing global
order]{.underline}. Although there is a wide spectrum of revisionist
states, [the "[measured revisionists]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Mazarr:
2015) [are the **rising powers** with **[value]{.mark}** for rule-based
[order and **no intent of**]{.mark} **aggressive [warfare]{.mark}** but
they do expect a **transformation** of the existing system and to do so
[they will take **cautious**]{.mark} and impactful [steps]{.mark} to
make a difference. The **reason** behind the **tactful approach** is
that [they want to **tilt** the power axis]{.mark} in their favour
[**without disturbing the system** altogether]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
international system is being witness to the revisionist states which
shall employ the grey zone strategy to cure their dilemmas of being
dissatisfied of the system while being dependant on it.

### AT: Grey Zone\-\--2NC

#### No escalation from grey-zone activity -- the entire strategy is premised on a [recognition]{.underline} of mutually assured destruction, and a [prioritization of gradual change]{.underline} over risky disruption. Grey zone actors [fear conventional escalation]{.underline} and are [cautious]{.underline} to avoid conventional retaliation, much less nuclear -- that's Kakoti. 

#### Economic interdependence [moderates]{.underline} grey-zone conflict -- incentives [peaceful resolution]{.underline} with Russia.

[In the modern **interconnected world**, [there is]{.mark} an
[**incentive** to employ]{.mark} **willful [blindness]{.mark}** in
relation [to]{.mark} **potential [threats]{.mark}** emanating
[from]{.mark} geostrategic **opponents** such as
**[Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These [authoritarian states provide
Western liberal **democracies** access to both [**inexpensive labor**
and]{.mark} vast **[energy]{.mark} resources** required to fuel
**economic growth**.]{.underline} Greed for short-term economic growth,
for example through reliance on comparative advantage principles,
however, may have long-term security consequences. However, [economic
[**interconnectedness** may]{.mark} also [create]{.mark} opportunities
for **[conflict resolution]{.mark}**. This means, [even though]{.mark}
**foreign [policy]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} state actors in [**gray-zone**
conflicts seems]{.mark}]{.underline} to be [guided by **[realist]{.mark}
thinking** and pursuit of maximum relative gains, [**liberal
institutionalism** should **not** be]{.mark} outright
[dismissed]{.mark}]{.underline}.

As we highlight in this article, the common wisdom in recent literature
on gray-zone conflicts has been to treat the economic domain as an area
of threat. However, [for the purpose of **conflict management** in
Ukraine, Moscow's increasingly interconnected **energy relations** with
the EU may also be an **opportunity** for **peaceful conflict
resolution**.]{.underline}

[Re-[engagement between the EU and Russia demonstrates]{.mark} that
**complex [interdependence]{.mark}** [can provide]{.mark} an opportunity
[for **conflict resolution**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Ukraine.26 [In the
contemporary **interconnected world**, there is no clear hierarchy
between economic and military issues among states. Moreover, [as]{.mark}
the **[cost of engagement]{.mark}** in **conventional** military
operations [has increased, the **economic domain** becomes]{.mark}
increasingly [**important** for]{.mark} **exercise of power** and

relationship observed is that [[as]{.mark} economic [interdependence
increases]{.mark} between nations, the [**cost** of]{.mark} upsetting
the **mutually beneficial environment** through [conflict

**No space war**

[The U.S. depends heavily on military and commercial
satellites]{.underline}. If a less satellite-dependent opponent launched
an anti-satellite (ASAT) attack, it would have far greater impact on the
U.S. than the attacker. However, it's not as simple as that -- for the
following reasons: 1. [An ASAT attack would likely be **part of a
larger, terrestrial attack**]{.underline}. An attack on space assets
would be no different than an attack on territory or other assets on
earth. This means that no space war would stay limited to space. An ASAT
campaign would be part of a larger conventional military conflict that
would play out on earth. 2. [[Every country with ASAT
capabilities]{.mark} also [needs
**sat**]{.mark}ellite**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While the United
States is the most dependent on military satellites, [most other
countries need satellites to participate in the global economy. All
countries that have the technical ability to play in this space -- the
[U.S., Russia, China and India]{.mark} - also [have a **vested
interest**]{.mark} in [preventing]{.mark} the [militarization]{.mark} of
space and protecting their own satellites. If any of those countries
were [to attack]{.mark} U.S. satellites, it [would]{.mark} likely
[**hurt them** far more]{.mark} than it would hurt the United
States.]{.underline} 3. Destruction of satellites could create a
damaging chain reaction. Scientists warn that the violent destruction of
satellites could result in an effect called an ablation cascade.
High-velocity debris from a destroyed satellite could crash into other
satellites and create more high-velocity debris. If an ablation cascade
were to occur, it could render certain orbital levels completely
unusable for centuries. 4. Any country that threatened access to space
would threaten the global economy. Even if a full-blown ablation cascade
didn't occur, an ASAT campaign would cause debris, making operating in
space more hazardous. The global economy relies on satellites and any
disruption of operations would be met with worldwide disapproval and
severe economic ramifications. 5. [[International **Prohibits**]{.mark}
the Use of [ASAT]{.mark} Weapons. Several international treaties
expressly **prohibit signatory nations** from attacking other countries'
space assets. It is generally accepted that space should be treated as a
global common area, rather than a military domain.]{.underline} While it
remains necessary for military planners to create contingency plans for
a, [[space war]{.underline}]{.mark} it [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[highly unlikely]{.underline}]{.mark}** scenario. [[All]{.mark}
involved [parties are **incentivized against** attacking]{.mark}.
However, [if]{.mark} a space war [did occur, it would be **part of** a
larger conflict **on Earth**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Those concerned about
the potential for war in space should be more concerned about the
potential for war, period.

#### No miscalc or escalation

A. Limited Accessibility Space is difficult. Over 60 years have passed
since the first Sputnik launch and only nine countries (ten including
the EU) have orbital launch capabilities. Moreover, [a launch programme
alone does not guarantee the **resources** and **precision required** to
**operate a meaningful ASAT capability**.]{.underline} Given this, one
possible reason why **[[space wars have not broken
out]{.underline}]{.mark}** is simply [because only the US has ever had
the ability to fight one]{.underline} \[21, p. 402\], \[22, pp.
419--420\]. [Although launch technology may become cheaper and easier,
it is unclear to what extent these advances will be distributed among
presently non-spacefaring nations. **[Limited access to orbit]{.mark}**
necessarily [reduces]{.mark} the [scenarios which could]{.mark}
plausibly [escalate]{.mark} to ASAT usage.]{.underline} Only major
conflicts between the handful of states with 'space club' membership
could be considered possible flashpoints. Even then, the [**[fragility
of]{.mark} an attacker's [own]{.mark} space [assets]{.mark}** [creates
**de-escalatory pressures** due to]{.mark} the **[deterrent effect of
retal]{.mark}iation**. Since]{.underline} the earliest days of [the
space race, dominant [powers]{.mark} have recognized this dynamic and
[demonstrated]{.mark} an inclination **[towards de-escalatory]{.mark}
space [strategies]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[23\]. B. Attributable Norms
[There]{.underline} also [exists a **long-standing normative framework**
favouring the **peaceful use of space**.]{.underline} The effectiveness
of this regime, centred around the Outer Space Treaty
[[(**OST**)]{.underline},]{.mark} is highly contentious and many have
pointed out its serious legal and political shortcomings \[24\]--\[26\].
Nevertheless, this status quo framework has somehow [[supported]{.mark}
over **[six decades of]{.mark} relative [peace]{.mark}** in
orbit.]{.underline} Over these six decades, [**norms have become deeply
ingrained** into the way states describe and perceive space
weaponization.]{.underline} This de facto codification was dramatically
demonstrated in 2005 when the US found itself on the short end of a
160-1 UN vote after opposing a non-binding resolution on space
weaponization. [Although states have occasionally pushed the boundaries
of these norms, this]{.underline} has typically [occurred through
incremental legal re-interpretation]{.underline} rather than outright
opposition \[27\]. Even the most notable incidents, such as the
2007-2008 US and Chinese ASAT demonstrations, were couched in rhetoric
from both the norm violators and defenders, depicting space as a
peaceful global commons \[27, p. 56\]. Altogether, this suggests that
[**[states perceive]{.mark} real [costs]{.mark}** [to breaking
this]{.mark} normative [tradition and]{.mark} may even
**[moderate]{.mark} their [behaviours]{.mark}**
accordingly.]{.underline} One further factor supporting this norms
regime is the [**high degree of attributability** surrounding ASAT
weapons.]{.underline} For kinetic ASAT technology, [[**plausible
deniability** and **stealth** are]{.mark} essentially
**[impossible]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The literally explosive act of
launching a rocket cannot evade detection and, if used offensively,
retaliation. [This imposes **high diplomatic costs** on ASAT
usage]{.underline} and testing, particularly during peacetime. C.
Environmental Interdependence [A third [stabilizing force relates
to]{.mark} the **orbital [debris consequences]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
ASATs. China's 2007 ASAT demonstration was the largest debris-generating
event in history, as the targeted satellite dissipated into thousands of
dangerous debris particles \[28, p. 4\]. [Since debris particles are
[indiscriminate]{.mark} and unpredictable, [they]{.mark} often
[threaten]{.mark} the [attacker's own]{.mark} space
[assets]{.mark}]{.underline} \[22, p. 420\]. This is compounded by
Kessler syndrome, a phenomenon whereby orbital debris 'breeds' as large
pieces of debris collide and disintegrate. As space debris remains in
orbit for hundreds of years, the [**cascade effect** of an ASAT attack
can constrain the attacker's long-term use of space]{.underline} \[29,
pp. 295-- 296\]. Any state with kinetic ASAT capabilities will likely
also operate satellites of its own, and they are necessarily exposed to
this collateral damage threat. [Space debris thus acts as a strong
strategic deterrent to ASAT usage.]{.underline}

To these examples [we may add a long list of tactical [blunders]{.mark}
growing out of ambiguous circumstances and faulty intelligence,
[including]{.mark} the U.S. [bombing]{.mark}]{.underline} in 1999 [of
the [Chinese Embassy]{.mark} in Belgrade]{.underline} during Kosovo
operations. [Yet [though]{.mark} these tragic actions occurred in
near-war or [tinderbox]{.mark} situations, they [did **not

[world]{.mark} also [survived]{.mark} U.S.-Soviet \"near encounters\"

**Guarded [diplomacy won the day]{.mark}** in all cases. [Why
would]{.mark} disputes affecting [space be]{.mark} any
[different?]{.mark}]{.underline} In other words, [[it is not]{.mark} at
all [self-evident]{.mark} that a sudden [loss of a]{.mark}
communications **[sat]{.mark}**ellite]{.underline}, for example, [[would
precipitate]{.mark} a wider-scale [war]{.mark} or make warfare
termination impossible. [In]{.mark} the context of [U.S.-Russian

authorities and forces [are **redundant**]{.mark}. Urgent

land]{.mark} lines [or]{.mark} the [air]{.mark}waves. **Other means are
also available** to perform special reconnaissance missions for
monitoring a crisis or compliance with an armistice]{.underline}. While
improvements are needed, our ability to know what transpires in space is
growing --- so we are not always in the dark. The burden is on the
critics, therefore, to present convincing analogical evidence to support
the notion that, in wartime or peacetime, attempts by the United States
to control space or exploit orbits for defensive or offensive purposes
would increase significantly the chances for crisis instability or
nuclear war. In Washington and other capitals, [the [historical pattern

**clarify**]{.mark} perceptions [and]{.mark} to [consider]{.mark}
decisions that might lead to war or [escalation with **care, not

#### Space hotline solves.

and the U.S. Can Avoid a Space War by Making That Hotline Bling,
12-9-2015,
https://science.howstuffworks.com/china-the-us-can-avoid-a-space-war-making-that-hotline-bling.htm\]

[The [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and
China aren\'t]{.mark} **100 percent [chummy]{.mark}**]{.underline} these
[days, [but]{.mark}]{.underline} that doesn\'t mean [the two
superpowers]{.underline} don\'t **[[talk]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As
Uncle Sam and the world\'s largest Communist country look to outdo each
other on the economic, military and political fronts, [the two
countries]{.underline} also recently [came together
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} try to [[avoid]{.mark} **a full-blown
[fight]{.mark}**]{.underline} either [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} outer
[[space]{.underline}]{.mark}. A new \"hotline\" will make it easier for
officials from the States and the Middle Kingdom to share information
about what they\'re doing up there in the final frontier, all to avoid
any international dust-up.

**[The new [communication system]{.mark}]{.underline}** will [allow the
countries\' leaders to **[talk]{.mark} directly** about]{.underline}
their [space]{.underline} activities [[via]{.mark} **secure
[text]{.mark} message**]{.underline}. It\'s intended [[to cut
through]{.mark} **diplomatic channels** and other **bureaucratic
[middlemen]{.mark}** so]{.underline} that [the presidents can **speak
quickly**]{.underline} to keep each other informed about operations in
space. [It\'s]{.underline} also [meant [to avoid]{.mark}]{.underline}
both [**accidental [collisions]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} any possible
misinterpretations]{.underline} about space activity that could be
[taken as]{.underline} acts of [[aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The space hotline is a first between the two countries -- [the [U.S. and
Russia]{.mark} already [have one]{.mark}]{.underline} in place -- and
world leaders have been relying on similar systems [[to avoid
hostilities]{.underline}]{.mark} on the ground and in the air for
decades.

Shortly after stepping back from the ledge of World War III
[[during]{.mark} the [Cuban missile crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
U.S. and Russia established a direct telegraph system to allow them to
alert each other of military and other moves. It turns out that the
mythical red phone connecting the Pentagon with the Kremlin exists only
on the big screen. Still, [**a super-secure email** and **audio
messaging system** linking the two countries has proven its
worth]{.underline} as a way [to keep leaders aware of]{.underline} each
other\'s [intentions]{.underline} when it comes to unrest in other
nations.

[During a [1967 skirmish between Israel and]{.mark}]{.underline} its
neighbors in the [[Middle East]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example,
[President]{.underline} Lyndon [Johnson]{.underline} used what was then
a teletype terminal to [inform Russia]{.underline}n leader Alexei
Kosygin that U.S. military planes would be flying to the Mediterranean
Sea.

Richard [Nixon]{.underline} used the hotline for similar updates [during
wars [in Pakistan and Cyprus]{.mark}]{.underline} during the late 1960s.
The goal was to keep the Russians aware of certain military movements so
that they didn\'t think the Americans were picking a fight.

The same idea has helped build the existing war hotlines that China
shares with Russian, India, Vietnam and Korea. Earlier efforts to create
a direct communication line for China and the U.S. have borne little
fruit. After the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, President George
H.W. Bush tried contacting his Chinese counterpart phone only to have
that call go unreturned.

[This new hotline offers]{.underline} something for both sides: Namely,
[the chance to avoid **orbital warfare** and **a space arms
race**]{.underline}.

Not a Silver Bullet

[While I argue that the NATO memorandum of understanding on offensive
cyber operations in systems or networks based in allied territory can
greatly help in promoting stability and enhancing confidence among
allies, it is not a silver bullet]{.underline}. **[It can only reduce
allied concerns rather than mitigate them]{.underline}**. Military cyber
organizations may still conduct effect-based operations in allied
territory without consent, leading allies to assert that their
sovereignty has been violated. And there's another crucial player
involved. As Gen. Nakasone noted in the Joint Force Quarterly article,
cyberspace is owned largely by the private sector. They deserve a seat
at the table as well.

#### OCOs fail\-\--cost-ineffective, and the US can't transfer infrastructure to allies

for International Security and Cooperation; Security Studies, "Cyber
Arms Transfer: Meaning, Limits, and Implications," vol. 31\]

[An offensive cyber organization will also need attack tools to achieve
a certain effect or goal]{.underline}. Payloads greatly vary in size. On
one end of the spectrum, they can come as very lightweight files that
are easy to distribute, but once executed they will trigger the download
of a much larger piece of malware.43 On the other end of the spectrum,
payloads can be multiple megabytes (MBs) in size. A multipurpose toolkit
was discovered in 2012 by researchers from Kaspersky Lab, which they
called Flame. Whereas the Stuxnet code is "only" about 1 MB in size,
Flame's malware code is about twenty times larger---and still not fully
understood.44

[It is difficult]{.underline}---**[and cost
inefficient]{.underline}**---[to build an arsenal of tools for a more
mature cyber command or intelligence agency]{.underline}. [Although
early development and stockpiling would be desirable to ensure swift
deployment if the need arises, tools often must be tailored to the
target and desired effect]{.underline} (especially if the actor desires
stealth and stability), [which means that in-time development is often
necessary]{.underline}. Consider, for example, a case in which the
leadership of a command decides there is a need to target a specific
programmable logic controller (PLC) used to run a certain manufacturing
process. The developers will likely have to build tools that can work on
that particular PLC model. If leadership subsequently decides to target
a different process, developers will have to deploy a new toolset.

Finally, [the more features of the target you can use, the less you need
yourself]{.underline}. Napoleon was famous for making sure his troops
were living off the land through which they moved. It allowed his army
to travel light and march long distances. This notion of living off the
land is also commonly applied to cyber operations. The attacker may use
something exotic to get into a target's network, but it makes a lot of
sense to subsequently use the target's existing infrastructure to gain
further network access. For example, [existing communication lines to
push out notifications can be used to move through an organization's
network. Living off the land is not merely done for cost-efficiency
benefits]{.underline}. The practice is equally, if not more, important
for remaining undetected.

Fourth, [to effectively run cyber operations an organization requires
infrastructure, broadly defined as the processes, structures, and
facilities needed to pull off an offensive cyber operatio]{.underline}n.
This element can be split into two categories: control infrastructure
and preparatory infrastructure. [Control infrastructure refers to
processes directly used to run an operation. This is also the type of
infrastructure that is generally burned down after a failed
operation]{.underline}. It includes domain names of phishing sites,
leaked email addresses, or other abused technologies.45 It also concerns
C&C infrastructure used in remotely conducted operations to maintain
communication with compromised systems within a target network.
Depending on an operation's goal and resources, the C&C infrastructure
might be as basic as a single server operating on the external
network.46 At the same time, an organization may run a whole set of
operations simply to compromise legitimate web servers to use them for
C&C later.

#### Refusal to specify Article 5 conditions wrecks effective cyberstrategy

[A one-size-fits-all approach to adversary cyber-operations may raise
particular problems in the Ukraine]{.underline} conflict. Anticipating
potential Russian cyberattacks against member states, [NATO leaders have
reaffirmed that Article 5, the treaty's collective defense clause,
applies to cyberspace, but they have also expressed ambiguity about what
specific operations might trigger it. A lack of clarity about how
thresholds and responses are defined risks undermining the credibility
of this pledge and the effectiveness of NATO's overall
cyberstrategy.]{.underline}

#### Clarifying [thresholds]{.underline} for invoking article V is [necessary]{.underline} \-\-- plan fails to restore cohesion

fully operational in 2023," Reuters, 10/16/18,

MONS, Belgium (Reuters) - [A new [NATO]{.mark} military command [center
to]{.mark} [deter]{.mark} computer hackers should be]{.underline} [fully
staffed in 2023 [and]{.mark} able to [mount]{.mark} its own [cyber
attacks]{.mark}]{.underline} [but the alliance [is]{.mark} still
[grappling with]{.mark} **[ground rules]{.mark}**]{.underline} for doing
so, [a senior general said]{.underline} on Tuesday.

[While NATO does not have **its own cyber weapons**]{.underline}, the
U.S.-led alliance established an operations center on Aug. 31 at its
military hub in Belgium. [The United States, Britain, Estonia and other
allies have since offered their cyber capabilities.]{.underline}

"This is an emerging domain and the threat is growing," said Major
General Wolfgang Renner, a German air force commander who oversees the
new cyber operations center, or CYOC, in Mons.

"[We have to be **prepared**]{.underline}, [to be able to **execute
operations**]{.underline} [in cyberspace]{.underline}. We have already
gone beyond protection and prevention," he told Reuters during a NATO
cyber conference.

[NATO communication and computer networks face **hundreds** of
**significant hacking attempts**]{.underline} **[every
month,]{.underline}** according to the NATO Communication and
Information Agency, while experts say Russia, North Korea and China are
constantly deploying sophisticated computer hacking weapons and
surveillance software.

Accusations by Western governments this month that Russia waged a global
hacking campaign have raised the profile of NATO's evolving strategy as
allied governments look for a response. The European Union on Monday
discussed its options, including a special economic sanctions regime to
target cyber attackers.

"Our ultimate aim is to be completely aware of our cyberspace, to
understand minute-by-minute the state of our networks so that commanders
can rely on them," said Ian West, chief of cyber security at the NATO
communication agency.

[When]{.underline} fully [operational]{.underline}, [the cyber center
aims to **coordinate** NATO's cyber deterrent]{.underline} through a
70-strong team of experts fed with military intelligence and real-time
information about hackers ranging from Islamist militants to organized
crime groups operating on behalf of hostile governments.

**[ARTICLE 5 DEBATE]{.underline}**

[[NATO has]{.mark} **formally [recognized]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[cyber]{.mark}space [as a]{.mark} **new [frontier]{.mark} in
defense**,]{.underline} along with land, air and sea, [meaning battles
could henceforth be waged on computer networks.]{.underline}

[[The center **could**]{.mark} potentially]{.underline} [[use]{.mark}
**[cyber weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that can **knock out enemy
missiles**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} **[air defenses]{.underline}**,
[or **destroy foes' computer networks**]{.underline} if commanders judge
such a cyber attack is less harmful to human life than a traditional
offensive with live weaponry.

[[That is]{.mark} now [the subject of]{.mark} **intense
[debate]{.mark}** [at NATO]{.mark}, [with]{.mark} alliance
[commanders]{.mark} **[saying]{.mark} publicly**]{.underline} [that
[cyber will be a]{.mark}n **integral [part of]{.mark} future
[war]{.mark}fare** [but allies **unclear**]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[what
would trigger]{.mark} NATO's [Article 5]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(collective defense) clause.

"[[Our]{.mark} **concept of operations**, a [toolbox]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} short-notice [decisions about how to respond]{.mark}, **[is
not in place]{.mark}** yet. This is one of the **challenges** we face,"
Renner]{.underline} [said]{.underline}.

[[If NATO can **agree**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[cyber war]{.mark}fare
[principles]{.mark}, [the alliance]{.mark} [hopes to
**integrate**]{.mark} individual [nations']{.mark} cyber
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[into alliance
op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**, coordinated through the Mons
cyber operations center and under the command of NATO's top general, the
Supreme Allied Commander Europe, or SACEUR.

[That [could allow]{.mark} the top [general to take **quick
decisions**]{.mark}]{.underline} [on whether to use cyber
weapons]{.underline}, similar to existing agreements for NATO's air
defenses and its ballistic missile shield, where a commander has only
minutes to decide what action to take.

### Article 5 Key\-\--2NC

#### Clarification of article V is key

David H. **Ucko 10**, adjunct fellow at the Department of War Studies,
King\'s College London\"Resetting Article 5: Toward a New Understanding
of NATO\'s Security Guarantees\", World Politics Review,
https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/6838/resetting-article-5-toward-a-new-understanding-of-natos-security-guarantees

For all this, [the [alliance]{.mark} badly [needs]{.mark} a
[**clarification** of]{.mark} its [collective security
mech]{.mark}anism, for, though its current **[ambiguity may fool]{.mark}
prospective [adversaries, it]{.mark} really [should not fool NATO
itself]{.mark}.** There is a need]{.underline}, in other words, [to
chart a **middle path** between traditionalists and revolutionaries,
whereby NATO **maintains a solidarity** clause but comes to a new,
**narrower** and shared understanding of its meaning and implications.
The point would be to [downgrade]{.mark} the [expectations]{.mark} that
come with NATO membership [by **talking more honestly**]{.mark},
**[within NATO]{.mark}**, [about what the alliance is]{.mark}
[**likely** and **able** to commit to.]{.mark}]{.underline}

First, [it would be necessary to convey, **in private**, to members that
**an Article 5 response** is not automatic, but is rather the product of
intensely **political processes** within each NATO state, and that even
if a response is forthcoming, there is no way of guaranteeing that it
will be timely or particularly effective. The language of an
**unflinching**, **immediate**, collective and effective response may be
appropriate for **audiences outside of NATO**, but not for **internal
discussion.** Within the alliance, **[less grandstanding]{.mark}
rhetoric** [and **greater transparency** would]{.mark} [reduce]{.mark}
the scope for [**obfuscation**. The **language of collective security**
would **remain**]{.mark} \-- for symbolic reasons, **[for the deterrent
role]{.mark}** that Article 5 still plays and for the foundation it
provides for retaliatory action. But the point would be to
**re-emphasize** within the alliance the oft-forgotten provision of
Article 5 whereby each member takes only **\"such action as it deems
necessary\"** when fulfilling its security obligations.]{.underline}

Second, [[NATO would]{.mark} need to **[delineate]{.mark}** much more
clearly [**what types of threats** it is capable of countering]{.mark}.
No doubt [a **nontraditional attack** can be]{.mark} as
[devastating]{.mark} as a military strike, but it does not follow that
NATO is equally prepared to handle both. The decision regarding NATO\'s
role in any incident must be based not only on the severity of a
potential attack, but also on **NATO\'s ability** to mount an effective
response.]{.underline} Whereas the language of solidarity following the
Sept. 11 attacks was certainly appropriate, a case can be made that NATO
ultimately overextended itself in invoking Article 5. The invocation
established a dangerous precedent for the kinds of threats that the
article might cover, many of which NATO lacks the expertise to deter, to
forestall or to counter. [[Talking loudly]{.mark} about collective
defense against non-traditional attacks **[without]{.mark} a concomitant
[ability to deliver]{.mark}** when they occur [is likely to provoke a
**crisis of credibility**]{.mark} for the alliance.]{.underline}

[Similar [**gaps between expectations and capabilities**
surround]{.mark} the issue of **[cybersecurity]{.mark}**]{.underline},
which Secretary-General Rasmussen recently suggested should be covered
by Article 5, as well as [**energy-security threats** and **economic
warfare**: NATO undoubtedly has a role to play in protecting its members
from these potentially very harmful forms of attack, yet until the
capability is created, it may want to **interpret** its **security
guarantees** more **narrowly**. This also raises the question of [how
serious an attack in a **nontraditional domain**]{.mark} [would need to
be to **trigger Article 5**]{.mark} considerations. Some informal
[**criteria** would]{.mark} need to [be agreed upon]{.mark} to inform
expectation, yet clearly this is also something that would need to be
settled [**behind closed doors**,]{.mark} so as not to invite attack and
provocation **under the established threshold** or precisely where
NATO\'s guarantees are the weakest.]{.underline}

Naturally, the prospect of agreeing within NATO to a more honest but
weaker Article 5 regime will elicit much support among those who rely
most on NATO\'s security guarantees. Nonetheless, [**greater
[transparency is preferable to false hope]{.mark}**. A hardnosed
**stocktaking** of what NATO can and cannot do would also provide for a
more promising foundation on which progress could be made: a **common
appraisal** of problems faced and a **framework for finding limited
solutions**, where possible. This would also [allow]{.mark} those
[nations that feel]{.mark} most [vulnerable to **make their own security
arrangements**]{.mark}, even if that means seeking relationships outside
the alliance structure]{.underline}. In the event that such arrangements
are inimical to NATO\'s interests, the onus would then be on the
alliance itself to provide a preferable alternative. In that sense,
[**greater transparency** would make the self-interest of individual
members the foundation of NATO\'s collective defense mechanism, rather
than the need to ensure the alliance\'s solidarity or prove its
relevance, the reasons most often used to justify Article 5 security
guarantees today but whose rhetorical appeal rarely translates into
action.]{.underline}

[Upholding a security regime that is limited, patchy and short on
substance is far from ideal, yet it would **accurately** reflect the
alliance\'s current **intentions**, **capabilities** and **political
will**. So long as both those making the promise of collective defense
and those hoping to take it up are **mutually aware of its true
possibilities and very real limitations**, it may be the **least-bad**
and most-viable way out of an **awkward situation.**]{.underline}

#### Without clarifying definitions, the plan is useless

Christopher **Woody 18**, Washington, DC-based editor covering military
and defense issues and foreign affairs." NATO leaders are worried about
cyberattacks, but it\'s not clear they all agree on what that means,"
Business Insider, 10/1/18,
https://www.businessinsider.com/nato-leaders-agree-cyberattacks-are-threat-but-cant-agree-definition-2018-10

[[NATO]{.mark} leadership appears to be in [agree]{.mark}ment that
cyberattacks and forms of [hybrid war]{.mark}fare that involve it [are
a]{.mark} **growing [threat]{.mark}** to]{.underline} [the alliance,
[but it\'s]{.mark} still [not]{.mark} totally [clear how]{.mark} its
[members **define**]{.mark} and]{.underline} **[evaluate]{.underline}**
[[that threat]{.mark}, and that raises questions about **how they\'ll
respond** to an attack.]{.underline}

[In late 2014]{.underline} --- several months [after the Russian
annexation of Crimea and incursion into Ukraine]{.underline} --- [NATO
leaders agreed that a large-scale cyberattack on one member **could be
considered an attack on the entire alliance**]{.underline}, potentially
leading to a military response.

\"Today we declare that cyber defense is part of NATO\'s core task of
collective defense\" NATO\'s secretary general at the time, Anders Fogh
Rasmussen, said of the decision.

The emphasis on the cyber realm grew considerably in 2017.

At the beginning of that year, NATO announced plans to spend more than
\$3 billion to upgrade its satellite and computer technology over three
years, including some \$900 million on computer systems that help
command air and missile defenses and \$80 million to improve protection
against cyberattacks at NATO\'s 32 main locations.

At the end of that year, NATO announced plans to increase its
cyber-defense capabilities, adapting its command structure to integrate
cyber weapons into its military operations in what one of the
alliance\'s former cyber-defense advisers called one of the
organization\'s biggest policy changes in years.

[Cyberattacks, along with other forms of hybrid warfare that fall short
of open combat, have complicated things for]{.underline}
[NATO]{.underline}, current Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in
September.

With cyber operations, Stoltenberg said, \"it\'s very hard to tell
exactly who attacked you. It\'s very hard to say exactly where it takes
place.\"

\"So we live in a \... completely different security environment with a
more blurred line between peace and war,\" he added.

In an interview on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York
City, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez echoed that view.

\"In my opinion, cybersecurity, a fight against hybrid wars or
strategies, is one of the major challenges for NATO,\" Sanchez said
during an interview with Reuters, adding that the alliance needs to
remain vigilant on its eastern and southern frontiers as well.

[[Despite]{.mark} the **growing [focus]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**increased [spending]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[NATO\'s]{.mark}
[response]{.mark} to cyber threats appears to have a problem with
**definitions**]{.underline} --- [namely, **what constitutes an attack**
and how severe it]{.underline} is.

In late 2017, after officials from France, NATO, and the EU offered
several widely varying tallies of cyberattacks in 2016, Stefan Soesanto,
a former cybersecurity and defense fellow at the European Council on
Foreign Relations, asked their agencies to ask what incidents were
included in their totals and if their standards were public, receiving
no response or no comment from each.

\"But [[without]{.mark} published **[standards]{.mark}** and
**discernable metrics**,]{.underline} such [[warnings]{.underline}
**[are of no]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[real
[value]{.mark}]{.underline}** [to the public]{.underline},\" Soesanto
wrote for Defense One in September.

\"We simply do not know whether 6,000 annual attacks against NATO\'s
infrastructure is a lot or whether any of the 24,000 attacks against the
French \[Ministry of Defense\] were serious,\" Soesanto added. \"All we
know is that something was counted by someone somehow to somewhat
explain the threat environment.\"

Further inquiry found that [even **within countries**]{.underline},
**[different agencies]{.underline}** [had]{.underline} **[different
definitions]{.underline}** [for what constituted a cyberattack and
different ways of determining their severity.]{.underline}

[This [**incoherence** creates]{.mark} **several
[problems]{.mark}**,]{.underline} according to Soesanto.

[The [lack of a **unifying standard** will lead public officials to
**over**- and **under-state**]{.mark} such [incidents]{.mark},
which]{.underline} in turn [undermines]{.underline} the public\'s
[ability to understand the threat]{.underline}.

[A **lack of cohesion**]{.underline} also [[hinders]{.mark}
cyber-[defense efforts **within** and **between** governments,]{.mark}
and,]{.underline} perhaps most important, **[muddies the rules of
engagement.]{.underline}**

\"[[NATO]{.mark} [member s]{.mark}tates [are]{.mark} embroiled in
[discussing]{.mark} **[cyber deterrence
frameworks]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[offensive
op]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[eration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[[and]{.underline} **[creating norms]{.underline}**]{.mark} and rules
[for state behavior in cyberspace, [they have]{.mark} **still [not
reached consensus on how to actually]{.mark} count and [categorize cyber
incidents across the alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" Soesanto writes.

### OCO's Bad\-\--1NC

#### OCOs cause positive feedback that intensify cyber conflicts and lower the nuclear threshold

**Healy '19** \[Jason Healy, School of International and Public Affairs,
Columbia University, "The implications of persistent (and permanent)
engagement in cyberspace" Journal of Cybersecurity, 2019,
https://academic.oup.com/cybersecurity/article/5/1/tyz008/5554878#140575448\]

The new strategy is a compelling assessment of cyber conflict as a state
of constant contact and presents a strong case that reduced operational
constraints enabling tactical friction to regain the initiative will
nudge conflict back towards lower levels of aggression \[9\]. It is
worth noting that forward defense is only one among several policies
that can be termed active defense or indeed cyber deterrence: the
administration of Donald Trump has continued and expanded a wide set of
policy tools used by previous administrations, including sanctions and
indictments \[59\]. It has also introduced new responses, most
importantly coordinated international attribution of Russian \[60\] and
North Korean \[61\] operations seen as particularly insulting to global
norms and getting search warrants for computers outside of US territory
in order to disrupt a North Korean botnet \[62\]. Still, it is no wonder
that the [[US military]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[embraced]{.underline}]{.mark} an academic concept justifying its
decade-long desire for [[**reduced operational constraints**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} a more **[[active
posture]{.underline}]{.mark}** to "take the fight to the enemy." There
remain major concerns. An **[overarching worry]{.underline}** is that
[US Cyber Command]{.underline} **[does not]{.underline}** [appear to see
this approach as fundamentally **risky.**]{.underline} The Vision
asserts that the Command wants to be "not risk averse but risk aware"
but it only highlights one procedural risk (an insufficient body of
highly trained personnel) and one diplomatic risk (adversaries will
falsely "seek to portray our strategy as 'militarizing' the cyberspace
domain"). But those are the only risks the Command can imagine, or at
least, is willing to publicly acknowledge. Indeed, [because]{.underline}
[[defending forward]{.mark} is framed as essential---"if the United
States is to shape the development of international cyberspace norms, it
can do so only [through active cyber operations]{.mark}"]{.underline}
\[54\], [and "not a choice, but a structurally and strategically driven
imperative" \[]{.underline}57\]---then the main risk is failing to adapt
quickly and forcefully enough. To get to the promised land of milk and
honey, superiority and stability, there is only one path: forward
defense. It is technically determined that there is a single dominant
strategy, one that is the best regardless of the strategies chosen by US
adversaries. As in the Cold War, the military is again attempting to
"pose starker alternatives and to couch them in terms of necessity
rather than choice:" either remove constraints on the military or lose
\[63\]. Imperatives are slippery things. Some are not imperatives at
all, just a particularly unyielding perspective or preference presented
as a dichotomy. How many US airmen died in World War Two because of the
bomber-driven cult of the offensive? Other imperatives may be critical
to tactical success but imperil the larger strategy, perhaps winning the
battle but losing the war. The [battlefield imperative to use
overwhelming firepower can, for example, be fatal to a counterinsurgency
strategy if it causes extensive collateral damage]{.underline}. [Even
seeming strategic imperatives]{.underline} can [lead to catastrophic
national security outcomes]{.underline}, as with Wilhelmine Germany's
pursuit of a grand fleet-in-being to challenge the British \[64\]. The
dynamics here may be similar. [A more thorough assessment of the
risks]{.underline} must be rooted with the simplest one, [[the
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} might [fail and **[intensify
competition]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Many assumptions]{.underline},
apparently unrecognized, underlie the belief that [the USA can have both
superiority and overmatch]{.underline} [as well as
stability]{.underline}. [Yet, in a system as complex as the Internet,
"we can never merely do one thing]{.underline}" \[9, page 10\].8 As Herb
Lin and Max Smeets of Stanford University highlight, "[neither
'escalate' or 'escalation' appear in the \[Vision\]
document,]{.underline}" a significant omission which suggests [[US Cyber
Command]{.mark} is **[downplaying]{.mark}**, or not fully thinking
through, the full [dynamics of conflic]{.mark}]{.underline}[t]{.mark}
\[65\]. A more [engaged [forward defense]{.mark}]{.underline} might
[result]{.mark} [not [in]{.mark} "negative"
feedback]{.underline}---reducing conflict by bringing it back to the
historical norm---but instead "[**[positive" feedback]{.mark}**,
exacerbating the conflict and [adversaries]{.mark} may [see]{.mark} the
new [US]{.mark} vision as a [challenge to]{.mark} **[rise to,]{.mark}**
[rather than]{.mark} one from which to [back away]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[9, chapter 4\]. According to my colleague [Robert Jervis, "a failure
to anticipate positive feedback is one reason why consequences are often
unintended,"]{.underline} \[9, page 165\] and sufficient [positive
feedback can [push the system]{.mark} past **[a tipping point]{.mark}**,
at which the system resets itself into a new, and potentially far more
dangerous, equilibrium]{.underline}. [[States have]{.mark} [decided to
keep]{.mark} their [attacks below]{.mark} certain [thresholds,
but]{.mark} conflict and **competition** in cyberspace is only a few
decades old.]{.underline} This may only be a phase, and an early one at
that. [[As]{.mark} [cyberspace becomes]{.mark} more
**[existential]{.mark}** for more states, the stakes continue to rise,
[elevating]{.mark} the [risks]{.mark}]{.underline} along with them.

#### OCO's cause hack-backs

**Sorcher '15** \[Sara; April 6; National Security Correspondent for the
National Journal and Deputy Editor of Passcode at the Christian Science
Monitor; \"Influencers: Companies should not be allowed to hack back,\"
Passcode. http://passcode.csmonitor.com/influencers-hackback\]

Even as [[companies]{.underline}]{.mark} are hit by increasingly
sophisticated cyberattacks, 82 percent of Influencers say they [[should
not]{.mark} be allowed to **\"[hack back]{.mark}\"**]{.underline} [to
retrieve stolen data or shut down computers targeting their
networks]{.underline}. There\'s been hot debate over companies\' rights
to defend themselves in cyberspace by taking offensive action.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} US [[government has been **reluctant to
intervene**]{.underline}]{.mark} as foreign-based hackers strike private
companies -- [[leaving]{.mark} this type of hacker-on-hacker
[retal]{.mark}iation a **[tantalizing]{.mark} option**]{.underline}
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} some [[victims. But]{.underline}]{.mark}
Passcode\'s pool of [[experts]{.mark} from across government, the
private sector, and the privacy advocacy community
[warn]{.mark}]{.underline} the strategy, commonly known as **[\"[hacking
back,\" could go very wrong]{.mark}]{.underline}**. \"Hacking back is
[the **worst option**]{.underline} for companies [because they don\'t
know who is on the other end]{.underline} of the keyboard nor what
capabilities that person has. What may start as simple \[intellectual
property\] theft could, after a [\'hacking back\']{.underline} attempt,
[result in the utter destruction of the entire network]{.underline},\"
says Jeffrey Carr, president of cybersecurity firm Taia Global. \"For a
small to medium-sized company, that could put them out of business. For
an enterprise, it could cost them hundreds of millions of dollars.
People with any life experience usually understand and respect the adage
\'never pick a fight with a stranger.\' The same adage applies in
cyberspace.\" [It could also **spark foreign policy
consequences**]{.underline}. [[Hackers]{.underline}]{.mark} could be
[[backed by]{.underline}]{.mark} other [[nation-states,
heighten]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[the prospect of]{.underline}]{.mark}
a [**[wider digital conflict]{.underline}** **[inadvertently
launched]{.underline}** [by the private sector]{.underline}]{.mark}.
\"We should not be [[looking to **escalate a
cyberwar**]{.underline}]{.mark}; we should be trying to defuse it,\"
said one Influencer who chose to remain anonymous. Another added:
\"Would we let it happen in the physical world?\" The Passcode
Influencers Poll brings together a diverse group of more than 90
security and privacy experts from across government, the private sector,
academia, and the privacy community. To preserve the candor of their
responses, Influencers have the choice to keep their comments anonymous,
or voice their opinions on the record. Some Influencers drew upon their
own personal experiences to explain the potential perils. \"I am an old
Army cyber guy and I had a boss who, when I was feeling frustrated when
I could not respond in kind back to a bad guy who was attacking us,
would pull me aside and say, \'You know what, Rick? The enemy gets a
vote,\' \" says Rick Howard, chief security officer for Palo Alto
Networks. \"Just because you are able to jab back against a cyber
adversary does not mean that you should. Do you think the bad guy will
just go away simply because you took a swing at him? Do you think he
will say, \'Wow, these guys are tough. I guess I will hang up my hacking
spurs forever?\' More likely than not, [you would have succeeded in
**[poking the beehive]{.mark}**]{.underline} and you may have unleashed
a world of hurt on your organization that it did not need.\" Even
government organizations where the sole purpose, Mr. Howard said, is to
attribute attacks have a hard to doing it with any level of confidence
that would warrant an offensive action. \"The idea of turning that
problem over to [a commercial organization]{.underline} who [does not
have a **tenth of the resources**]{.underline} is ludicrous,\" he said.
\"[The result [would]{.mark}]{.underline} be to [[transform the Internet
into the **Wild**]{.mark} **Wild [West]{.mark}**]{.underline};
commercial organizations pointing their cyber six-shooters at any
perceived slight rightfully or wrongly.\" Even then, Howard says, [[the
task should be left to]{.mark} **professionals: [law enforcement and
intel]{.mark}ligence**]{.underline}. They too \"absolutely should not
get carte blanche for this kind of activity. There has to be some rules
put in place that all citizens understand. There has to be some
oversight put in place that regularly reports back to the citizenry
about what these forces are doing.\" A minority of 18 percent of
Influencers said companies should be allowed to hack back after they\'re
hit. \"There is a significant spectrum of options for a victim to employ
against a cyberattacker; \'shutting down\' the computers used in an
attack is at the extreme end of that spectrum,\" one Influencer said.
\"The fact is, [the US government is **not responding**]{.underline} to
vast majority of cyberintrusions, whether for theft or destruction;
private companies are on their own, and as such, they should be able to
defend themselves in cyberspace. Does the Second Amendment not extend to
cyberspace?\" If companies cannot get timely help and protection from
law enforcement, one Influencer said, \"they should be allowed to take
responsible action to mitigate the impact of theft of their data. This
should be done with full accountability for any damage to innocent
parties.\" Companies should be allowed to hack back \"but only under
strict controls, such as using a bonded, licensed company -- perhaps
even deputized by an accredited law enforcement agency -- which acts on
their behalf,\" suggested Jay Healey, head of the Cyber Statecraft
Initiative at the Atlantic Council think tank. \"This should start as a
small pilot project as [the **international blow back**]{.underline} [is
likely to be **significant**]{.underline}.\" We want to hear from you.
Take the readers version of the Influencers poll here. \"Hacking back
sounds like a great idea until you think about how easy it is to
subvert. Today\'s attackers go to great lengths to hide the source of
their attacks. How can any company know they\'re really hacking their
attacker, and not some innocent bystander?\" - Matthew Green, Johns
Hopkins University \"The idea that someone could \'hack back\' without
producing unintended consequences is absurd pipe dream promoted by
businesses trying to monetize the concept. The millions of innocent
people around the world whose machines are unwittingly serving as
waypoints or botnet hosts would be the ones who ultimately pay the
price.\" - Chris Finan, Manifold Security \"Today the Internet is the

Jacob Olcott, BitSight Technologies \"Companies should be investing in
actual defense mechanisms, not offensive capabilities. Actually doing
defense is a far better security tactic than \'hack back.\'
Additionally, companies tend to have a misunderstanding of how difficult
doing offense is and a misunderstanding of what can be gained. Applying
the resources to being able to do \'hack back\' to security would be a
better use of those resources and go farther for the intended goals.
Additionally, once data is gone from the network there is rarely any
ability to \'retrieve\' it or keep it from ending up in the adversary\'s
hands. Executives in companies discussing \'hack back\' strategies
should focus efforts on empowering and training their people, breaking
down cultural barriers hampering security, and aligning efforts to the
threats they actually face.\" - Robert Lee, Dragos Security \"It
depends. There are so many possible unintended consequences in hacking
back that unless you truly understand what you are doing, it isn\'t
worth the risk. Remember, when you hack back, you are escalating an
event with someone who may have far greater skills, resources and evil
intent than you. Hacking back should only be done after consulting with
legal counsel because this opens a company up to all sorts of complex
legal issues -- especially if you hack back and find out you've made a
mistake. Additionally and this is a bit unfair, but if you couldn't keep
someone out of your environment in the first place, what makes you think
you have the skill to up the game by attacking back?\" - Mark
Weatherford, Chertoff Group \"Hey, I\'ve got an idea, let\'s legalize
vigilantism, but only for the one type of crime where people constantly
talk about how difficult accurate attribution is. What could go

America \"While we can imagine cases where it\'d be satisfying for
companies to do this, madness this way lies. Bad actors almost never
directly tunnel into a network; they hide behind hijacked accounts and
machines. To contemplate \'hacking back\' puts those intermediate
accounts and machines more in the crossfire. This isn\'t to say nothing
should be done -- ISPs and others can play a helpful role in
quarantining the launching pads of attacks that are being used without
their owners\' knowledge -- but hacking back should be off the
table.\" - Jonathan Zittrain, Harvard University \"The legal right to

attacks, accurately identifying the attacker has proven elusive at
best.\" - Influencer \"Hack back, retaliation, vigilantism. These words
not only make for great headlines; they spark heated debate over the
appropriate roles of the private sector and government in cybersecurity.
Unfortunately, the \'hack-back\' debate often obscures a much more
fundamental debate over the future direction of US cybersecurity policy.
For the past two decades, US cybersecurity has focused almost
exclusively on defense -- we\'ve dedicated our time and resources to
making it harder for our adversaries to penetrate our networks. But
strong network fortifications are not fail-safe. Especially against
nation-states and other concerted adversaries who are willing to go to
almost any level of time, effort, and expense to penetrate a target\'s
network. Defensive measures alone may delay -- but are unlikely to
prevent -- penetration of target networks by concerted adversaries.
Focusing exclusively on defense will not solve our cybersecurity
problem. We need to raise the costs and risks to concerted adversaries
in order to deter their activities. There are many divergent views as to
the best way to do this, but one thing is clear: the time has come for a
national conversation. [Effective **deterrence** is **not synonymous
with hack-back**]{.underline}, retaliation, or vigilantism. [Elements
of]{.underline} an [effective deterrence]{.underline} strategy [include:
real-time **detection**]{.underline} of intrusions (a high likelihood of

**identification**]{.underline} and punishment of cyberintruders. In the

continue targeting our networks.\" - Melanie Teplinsky, American
University \"There is a range of activities from passive defense,

strategic logic that leads us to view cyberwar as a limited political

one participant remarked on "how quickly

Importantly, [this sort of **[catalytic instability]{.mark}** arises not
from the cyber domain itself but through its interaction with forces and

[Further, it arises]{.underline} only in situations [[where

robust]{.underline} [**[traditional military

[**[Classical]{.underline}** [deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark} [theory
developed to [explain]{.mark} nuclear deterrence with nuclear weapons,
but]{.underline} different types of weapons or
**[combinations]{.underline}** of operations in different domains can
[have]{.underline} **[differential effects]{.underline}** on deterrence
and defense \[18, 19\]. [Nuclear weapons and cyber operations
are]{.underline} particularly **[complementary]{.underline}** (i.e.
nearly complete opposites) [with respect to their strategic
characteristics.]{.underline} [Theorists and practitioners have stressed
the unprecedented **destructiveness**]{.underline} [of nuclear weapons

more, important for deterrence that capabilities and intentions
are]{.underline} **[clearly communicated]{.underline}**. As quickly
became apparent, **[[public displays]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[of]{.underline} their [nuclear arsenals improved deterrence. At the
same time, disclosing]{.underline} **[details]{.underline}** of a
nation's nuclear capabilities [did not much degrade the ability to
strike or retaliate, given that defense against nuclear attack remains
extremely difficult.]{.underline} Knowledge of nuclear capabilities is
necessary to achieve a deterrent effect \[20\]. [**[Cyber]{.mark}**
operations, in contrast, [rely on **undisclosed
vulnerabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline}, social engineering, and creative
guile to generate indirect effects in the information systems that
coordinate military, economic, and social behavior. Revelation enables
crippling countermeasures, while the imperative to conceal capabilities
constrains both the scope of cyber operations and their utility for
coercive signaling \[21, 22\]. The diversity of cyber operations and
confusion about their effects also contrast with the obvious
destructiveness of nuclear weapons. The problem is that [transparency
and deception]{.underline} [**do not mix well**. [An attacker who
hacks]{.mark} an adversary's [nuclear **c**]{.mark}ommand [and
**c**]{.mark}ontrol apparatus, or the weapons themselves, [will gain an
**advantage**]{.mark} **in warfighting**]{.underline} [that [the
attacker]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**cannot reveal**, while the
**adversary** will **continue to believe it wields a deterrent**]{.mark}
**that may no longer exist.**]{.underline} [Most analyses of inadvertent
escalation from cyber or conventional to nuclear war focus on "use it or
lose it" pressures and fog of war]{.underline} created by attacks that
become visible to the target \[23, 24\]. In a US--China conflict
scenario, for example, conventional military strikes in conjunction with
cyber attacks that blind sensors and confuse decision making could
generate incentives for both sides to rush to preempt or escalate
\[25--27\]. These are plausible concerns, but the revelation of
information about a newly unfavorable balance of power might also cause
hesitation and lead to compromise. Cyber blinding could potentially make
traditional offensive operations more difficult, shifting the advantage
to defenders and making conflict less likely. **[Clandestine
attacks]{.underline}** [that remain invisible to the target]{.underline}
potentially [present [a]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}**[more [insidious
threat to crisis stability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. There are empirical
and theoretical reasons for taking seriously the effects of offensive
cyber operations on nuclear deterrence, and we should expect the dangers
to vary with the relative cyber capabilities of the actors in a crisis
interaction. Nuclear command and control vulnerability General Robert
Kehler, commander of US Strategic Command (STRATCOM) in 2013, stated in
testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, "we are very
concerned with the potential of a cyber-related attack on our nuclear
command and control and on the weapons systems themselves" \[28\].
Nuclear command, control, and communications ([NC3]{.underline}) [form
the nervous system of the nuclear enterprise]{.underline} spanning
intelligence and early warning sensors located in orbit and on Earth,
fixed and mobile command and control centers through which national
leadership can order a launch, operational nuclear forces including
strategic bombers, land-based intercontinental missiles (ICBMs),
submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and the communication and
transportation networks that tie the whole apparatus together \[29,
30\]. [NC3 should ideally ensure that nuclear forces will **always be
available** if **authorized**]{.underline} [by the National Command
Authority (to **enhance deterrence**) and never used]{.underline}
**[without authorization]{.underline}** ([to enhance **safety** and
**reassurance**]{.underline}). **[Friendly errors]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} **[enemy interference]{.underline}** [in NC3 [can
**undermine the "always-never" criterion**]{.mark}]{.underline},
**[weakening deterrence]{.underline}** \[31, 32\]. [NC3 has long been
recognized as the **weakest link** in the US nuclear
enterprise]{.underline}. According to a declassified official history, a
Strategic Air Command (SAC) task group in 1979 "reported that tactical
warning and communications systems ... were 'fragile' and susceptible to
electronic countermeasures, electromagnetic pulse, and sabotage, which
could deny necessary warning and assessment to the National Command
Authorities" \[33\]. Two years later, the Principal Deputy Under
Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering released a
broad-based, multiservice report that doubled down on SAC's findings:
"the United States could not assure survivability, endurability, or
connectivity of the national command authority function" due to: major
command, control, and communications deficiencies: in tactical warning
and attack assessment where existing systems were vulnerable to
disruption and destruction from electromagnetic pulse, other high
altitude nuclear effects, electronic warfare, sabotage, or physical
attack; in decision making where there was inability to assure national
command authority survival and connection with the nuclear forces,
especially under surprise conditions; and in communications systems,
which were susceptible to the same threats above and which could not
guarantee availability of even minimum-essential capability during a
protracted war. \[33\] [The [nuclear]{.mark} weapons [safety
lit]{.mark}erature]{.underline} likewise [[provides a **number
of**]{.mark} troubling **[examples]{.mark}** of **NC3
glitches**]{.underline} [that illustrate some of the **vulnerabilities**
[attackers **could**]{.mark}]{.underline}, in principle,
**[[exploit]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[34--36\]. The SAC history noted
that **[NORAD]{.underline}** [has received **numerous false launch
indications**]{.underline} from faulty computer components, [**loose
circuits**, and even a **nuclear war training tape** loaded by mistake
into a live system that produced erroneous Soviet launch
indications]{.underline} \[33\]. In a 1991 briefing to the STRATCOM
commander, a Defense Intelligence Agency targeteer confessed, "Sir, I
apologize, but we have found a problem with this target. There is a
mistake in the computer code ... . Sir, the error has been there for at
least the life of this eighteen-month planning cycle. The nature of the
error is such that the target would not have been struck" \[37\]. It
would be a difficult operation to intentionally plant undetected errors
like this, but [the presence of bugs does reveal that]{.underline} such
**[a hack is possible]{.underline}**. [Following many near-misses and
self-audits]{.underline} during and after the Cold War, [American NC3
improved with the addition of new safeguards and
redundancies]{.underline}. As General Kehler pointed out in 2013, "the
nuclear deterrent force was designed to operate through the most extreme
circumstances we could possibly imagine" \[28\]. Yet vulnerabilities
remain. In 2010, the US Air Force lost contact with 50 Minuteman III
ICBMs for an hour because of a faulty hardware circuit at a launch
control center \[38\]. If the accident had occurred during a crisis, or
the component had been sabotaged, the USAF would have been unable to
launch and unable to detect and cancel unauthorized launch attempts. As
Bruce Blair, a former Minuteman missileer, points out, during a control
center blackout the antennas at unmanned silos and the cables between
them provide potential surreptitious access vectors \[39\]. The
unclassified summary of a 2015 audit of US NC3 stated that "known
capability gaps or deficiencies remain" \[40\]. Perhaps more worrisome
are the unknown deficiencies. A 2013 Defense Science Board report on
military cyber vulnerabilities found that while the: nuclear deterrent
is regularly evaluated for reliability and readiness ... , most of the
systems have not been assessed (end-to-end) against a \[sophisticated
state\] cyber attack to understand possible weak spots. A 2007 Air Force
study addressed portions of this issue for the ICBM leg of the U.S.
triad but was still not a complete assessment against a high-tier
threat. \[41\] [If NC3 **vulnerabilities** are unknown, it is also
**unknown** whether]{.underline} [an **advanced cyber actor** would be
able to **exploit** them.]{.underline} As Kehler notes, "**[[We don't
know what we don't know]{.underline}]{.mark}**" \[28\]. [Even if NC3 of
nuclear forces narrowly conceived is a hard target, cyber [attacks
on]{.mark} **other [critical infrastructure]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
preparation to or [during a nuclear crisis [could **complicate**]{.mark}
or **confuse [government decision making]{.mark}**]{.underline}. General
Keith Alexander, Director of the NSA in the same Senate hearing with
General Kehler, testified that: [our infrastructure that we ride on, the
[**power** and]{.mark} the **[comm]{.mark}**unication**[s]{.mark}**
grid, are one of the things that is a source of concern ... [we can go
to backup generators]{.mark} and we can have independent routes,
[but]{.mark} ... our [ability to **communicate**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[would be **significantly reduced**]{.mark} and it would complicate our
**governance**]{.underline} ... . I think what General Kehler has would
be intact ... \[but\] [[the]{.underline} **[cascading
effect]{.underline}**]{.mark}[ ... in that kind of environment ...
[concerns us.]{.mark}]{.underline} \[28\] Kehler further emphasized that
"there's a continuing need to make sure that we are protected against
electromagnetic pulse and any kind of electromagnetic interference"
\[28\]. Many NC3 components are antiquated and hard to upgrade, which is
a mixed blessing. Kehler points out, "[Much of the nuclear command and
control system today is the legacy system]{.underline} that we've had.
[In some ways that helps us in terms of the cyber threat. In some cases
it's point to point, hard-wired, which makes it very difficult for an
external]{.underline} cyber [threat to emerge]{.underline}" \[28\]. The
Government Accountability Office notes that the "Department of Defense
uses 8-inch floppy disks in a legacy system that coordinates the
operational functions of the nation's nuclear forces" \[42\]. While this
may limit some forms of remote access, [it is also indicative of
reliance on an earlier generation of software when **security**
engineering standards were **less mature**]{.underline}. Upgrades to the
digital Strategic Automated Command and Control System planned for 2017
have the potential to correct some problems, but these changes may also
introduce new access vectors and vulnerabilities \[43\]. Admiral Cecil
Haney, Kehler's successor at STRATCOM, highlighted the challenges of NC3
modernization in 2015: Assured and reliable NC3 is fundamental to the
credibility of our nuclear deterrent. The aging NC3 systems continue to
meet their intended purpose, but risk to mission success is increasing
as key elements of the system age. The unpredictable challenges posed by
today's complex security environment make it increasingly important to
optimize our NC3 architecture while leveraging new technologies so that
NC3 systems operate together as a core set of survivable and endurable
capabilities that underpin a broader, national command and control
system. \[44\] In no small irony, the internet itself owes its
intellectual origin, in part, to the threat to NC3 from large-scale
physical attack. A 1962 RAND report by Paul Baran considered "the
problem of building digital communication networks using links with less
than perfect reliability" to enable "stations surviving a physical
attack and remaining in electrical connection ... to operate together as
a coherent entity after attack" \[45\]. Baran advocated as a solution
decentralized packet switching protocols, not unlike those realized in
the ARPANET program. The emergence of the internet was the result of
many other factors that had nothing to do with managing nuclear
operations, notably the meritocratic ideals of 1960s counterculture that
contributed to the neglect of security in the internet's founding
architecture \[46, 47\]. Fears of NC3 vulnerability helped to create the
internet, which then helped to create the present-day cybersecurity
epidemic, which has come full circle to create new fears about NC3
vulnerability. NC3 vulnerability is not unique to the United States. The
NC3 of other nuclear powers may even be easier to compromise, especially
in the case of new entrants to the nuclear club like North Korea.
Moreover, the United States has already demonstrated both the ability
and willingness to infiltrate sensitive foreign nuclear infrastructure
through operations such as Olympic Games (Stuxnet), albeit targeting
Iran's nuclear fuel cycle rather than NC3. It would be surprising to
learn that the United States has failed to upgrade its Cold War NC3
attack plans to include offensive cyber operations against a wide
variety of national targets. Hacking the deterrent The United States
included NC3 attacks in its Cold War counterforce and damage limitation
war plans, even as contemporary critics perceived these options to be
destabilizing for deterrence \[48\]. The best known example of these
activities and capabilities is a Special Access Program named Canopy
Wing. East German intelligence obtained the highly classified plans from
a US Army spy in Berlin, and the details began to emerge publicly after
the Cold War. An East German intelligence officer, Markus Wolf, writes
in his memoir that Canopy Wing "listed the types of electronic warfare
that would be used to neutralize the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact's
command centers in case of all-out war. It detailed the precise method
of depriving the Soviet High Command of its high-frequency
communications used to give orders to its armed forces" \[49\]. It is
easy to see why NC3 is such an attractive target in the unlikely event
of a nuclear war. [If for whatever reason deterrence fails and the enemy
decides to push the nuclear button, it would obviously be better to
disable or destroy missiles **before they launch**]{.underline} than to
rely on possibly futile efforts to shoot them down, or to accept the
loss of millions of lives. American plans to disable Soviet NC3 with
electronic warfare, furthermore, would have been intended to complement
plans for decapitating strikes against Soviet nuclear forces. Temporary
disabling of information networks in isolation would have failed to
achieve any important strategic objective. A blinded adversary would
eventually see again and would scramble to reconstitute its ability to
launch its weapons, expecting that preemption was inevitable in any
case. Reconstitution, moreover, would invalidate much of the
intelligence and some of the tradecraft on which the blinding attack
relied. Capabilities fielded through Canopy Wing were presumably
intended to facilitate a preemptive military strike on Soviet NC3 to
disable the ability to retaliate and limit the damage of any retaliatory
force that survived, given credible indications that war was imminent.
Canopy Wing included \[50\]: "Measures for short-circuiting ...
communications and weapons systems using, among other things,
microscopic carbon-fiber particles and chemical weapons." "Electronic
blocking of communications immediately prior to an attack, thereby
rendering a counterattack impossible." "Deployment of various weapons
systems for instantaneous destruction of command centers, including
pin-point targeting with precision-guided weapons to destroy 'hardened
bunkers'." "Use of deception measures, including the use of
computer-simulated voices to override and substitute false commands from
ground-control stations to aircraft and from regional command centers to
the Soviet submarine fleet." "Us\[e of\] the technical installations of
'Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty' and 'Voice of America,' as well as the
radio communications installations of the U.S. Armed Forces for creating
interference and other electronic effects." Wolf also ran a spy in the
US Air Force who disclosed that the Americans had managed to penetrate
the \[Soviet air base at Eberswalde\]'s ground-air communications and
were working on a method of blocking orders before they reached the
Russian pilots and substituting their own from West Berlin. Had this
succeeded, the MiG pilots would have received commands from their
American enemy. It sounded like science fiction, but, our experts
concluded, it was in no way impossible that they could have pulled off
such a trick, given the enormous spending and technical power of U.S.
military air research. \[49\] One East German source claimed that Canopy
Wing had a \$14.5 billion budget for research and operational costs and
a staff of 1570 people, while another claimed that it would take over 4
years and \$65 million to develop "a prototype of a sophisticated
electronic system for paralyzing Soviet radio traffic in the
high-frequency range" \[50\]. Canopy Wing was not cheap, and even so, it
was only a research and prototyping program. Operationalization of its
capabilities and integration into NATO war plans would have been even
more expensive. This is suggestive of the level of effort required to
craft effective offensive cyber operations against NC3. Preparation
comes to naught when a sensitive program is compromised. Canopy Wing was
caught in what we describe below as the cyber commitment problem, the
inability to disclose a warfighting capability for the sake of
deterrence without losing it in the process. According to New York Times
reporting on the counterintelligence investigation of the East German
spy in the Army, Warrant Officer James Hall, "officials said that one
program rendered useless cost hundreds of millions of dollars and was
designed to exploit a Soviet communications vulnerability uncovered in
the late 1970\'s" \[51\]. This program was probably Canopy Wing. Wolf
writes, "Once we passed \[Hall's documents about Canopy Wing\] on to the
Soviets, they were able to install scrambling devices and other
countermeasures" \[49\]. It is tempting to speculate that the Soviet
deployment of a new NC3 system known as Signal-A to replace Signal-M
(which was most likely the one targeted by Canopy Wing) was motivated in
part by Hall's betrayal \[50\]. Canopy Wing underscores the potential
and limitations of NC3 subversion. Modern cyber methods can potentially
perform many of the missions Canopy Wing addressed with electronic
warfare and other means, but with even greater stealth and precision.
Cyber operations might, in principle, compromise any part of the NC3
system (early warning, command centers, data transport, operational
forces, etc.) by blinding sensors, injecting bogus commands or
suppressing legitimate ones, monitoring or corrupting data
transmissions, or interfering with the reliable launch and guidance of
missiles. In practice, the operational feasibility of cyber attack
against NC3 or any other target depends on the software and hardware
configuration and organizational processes of the target, the
intelligence and planning capacity of the attacker, and the ability and
willingness to take advantage of the effects created by cyber attack
\[52, 53\]. Cyber compromise of NC3 is technically plausible though
operationally difficult, a point to which we return in a later section.
To understand which threats are not only technically possible but also
probable under some circumstance, we further need a political logic of
cost and benefit \[14\]. In particular, how is it possible for a crisis
to escalate to levels of destruction more costly than any conceivable
political reward? Canopy Wing highlights some of the strategic dangers
of NC3 exploitation. Warsaw Pact observers appear to have been deeply
concerned that the program reflected an American willingness to
undertake a surprise decapitation attack: they said that it "sent
ice-cold shivers down our spines" \[50\]. The Soviets designed a system
called Perimeter that, not unlike the Doomsday Device in Dr.
Strangelove, was designed to detect a nuclear attack and retaliate
automatically, even if cut off from Soviet high command, through an
elaborate system of sensors, underground computers, and command missiles
to transmit launch codes \[54\]. Both Canopy Wing and Perimeter show
that the United States and the Soviet Union took nuclear warfighting
seriously and were willing to develop secret advantages for such an
event. By the same token, they were not able to reveal such capabilities
to improve deterrence to avoid having to fight a nuclear war in the
first place. Nuclear deterrence and credible communication Nuclear
weapons have some salient political properties. They are singularly and
obviously destructive. They kill in more, and more ghastly, ways than
conventional munitions through electromagnetic radiation, blast,
firestorms, radioactive fallout, and health effects that linger for
years. Bombers, ICBMs, and SLBMs can project warheads globally without
significantly mitigating their lethality, steeply attenuating the
conventional loss-of-strength gradient \[55\]. Defense against nuclear
attack is very difficult, even with modern ballistic missile defenses,
given the speed of incoming warheads and use of decoys; multiple
warheads and missile volleys further reduce the probability of perfect
interception. If one cannot preemptively destroy all of an enemy's
missiles, then there is a nontrivial chance of getting hit by some of
them. When one missed missile can incinerate millions of people, the
notion of winning a nuclear war starts to seem meaningless for many
politicians. As defense seemed increasingly impractical, early Cold War
strategists championed the threat of assured retaliation as the chief
mechanism for avoiding war \[56--59\]. Political actors have issued
threats for millennia, but the advent of nuclear weapons brought
deterrence as a strategy to center stage. The Cold War was an intense
learning experience for both practitioners and students of international
security, rewriting well-worn realities more than once \[60--62\]. A key
conundrum was the practice of brinkmanship. Adversaries who could not
compete by "winning" a nuclear war could still compete by manipulating
the "risk" of nuclear annihilation, gambling that an opponent would have
the good judgment to back down at some point short of the nuclear brink.
Brinkmanship crises---conceptualized as games of Chicken where one
cannot heighten tensions without increasing the hazard of the mutually
undesired outcome---require that decision makers behave irrationally, or
possibly that they act randomly, which is difficult to conceptualize in
practical terms \[63\]. The chief concern in historical episodes of
chicken, such as the Berlin Crisis and Cuban Missile Crisis, was not
whether a certain level of harm was possible, but whether an adversary
was resolved enough, possibly, to risk nuclear suicide. The logical
inconsistency of the need for illogic to win led almost from the
beginning of the nuclear era to elaborate deductive contortions
\[64--66\]. Both mutually assured destruction (MAD) and successful
brinksmanship depend on a less appreciated, but no less fundamental,
feature of nuclear weapons: political transparency. Most elements of
military power are weakened by disclosure \[67\]. Military plans are
considerably less effective if shared with an enemy. Conventional
weapons become less lethal as adversaries learn what different systems
can and cannot do, where they are located, how they are operated, and
how to devise countermeasures and array defenses to blunt or disarm an
attack. In contrast, relatively little reduction in destruction follows
from enemy knowledge of nuclear capabilities. For most of the nuclear
era, no effective defense existed against a nuclear attack. Even today,
with evolving ABM systems, one ICBM still might get through and
annihilate the capital city. Nuclear forces are more robust to
revelation than other weapons, enabling nuclear nations better to
advertise the harm they can inflict. [The need for transparency to
achieve an effective deterrent is driven home by the satirical Cold War
film, Dr. Strangelove: "the whole point of a Doomsday Machine is lost,
if you keep it a secret! Why didn't you tell the world]{.underline},
eh?" [During the real Cold War]{.underline}, fortunately, [Soviet
leaders paraded their nuclear weapons through Red Square for the benefit
of foreign military attaches and the international press
corps]{.underline}. Satellites photographed missile, bomber, and
submarine bases. While other aspects of military affairs on both sides
of the Iron Curtain remained closely guarded secrets, the United States
and the Soviet Union permitted observers to evaluate their nuclear
capabilities. This is especially remarkable given the secrecy that
pervaded Soviet society. [The relative transparency of nuclear arsenals
ensured that the superpowers could calculate risks and
consequences]{.underline} within a first-order approximation, which led
to a reduction in severe conflict and instability even as political
competition in other arenas was fierce \[61, 68\]. Recent insights about
the causes of war suggest that **[divergent expectations]{.underline}**
[about the costs and consequences of war are **necessary for contests to
occur**]{.underline} \[69--73\]. These insights are associated with
rationalist theories, such as deterrence theory itself. [[Empirical
studies]{.mark} and psychological critiques of the **rationality**
assumption have [helped]{.mark} to **[refine models]{.mark}** and bring
some **circumspection** into their application, [but]{.mark} the
formulation of **[sound]{.mark} strategy** (if not the
**[execution]{.mark}**) [still requires]{.mark} the articulation of
**some [rational linkage]{.mark}** between cause and effect]{.underline}
\[19, 62, 74\]. [Many supposedly **[nonrational factors]{.mark}**,
moreover, simply manifest as **uncertainty** in strategic
interaction.]{.underline} Our focus here is on the effect of uncertainty
and ignorance on the ability of states and other actors to bargain in
lieu of fighting. [Many wars are [a product of]{.mark} what adversaries
do not know or what they misperceive, whether as a result of
[**bluffing**, **secrecy**, or **intrinsic
uncertainty**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[75, 76\]. [If knowledge of
capabilities or resolve [is]{.mark} a prerequisite for deterrence, then
[one reason for **deterrence failure**]{.mark} is the inability or
unwillingness to **credibly communicate details of the genuine balance
of power**]{.underline}, threat, or interests. Fighting, conversely, can
be understood as a costly process of discovery that informs adversaries
of their actual relative strength and resolve. From this perspective,
successful deterrence involves instilling in an adversary perceptions
like those that result from fighting, but before fighting actually
begins. Agreement about the balance of power can enable states to
bargain (tacit or overt) effectively without needing to fight, forging
compromises that each prefers to military confrontation or even to the
bulk of possible risky brinkmanship crises. [Despite other deficits,
nuclear weapons have long been considered to be stabilizing with respect
to **rational incentives for war**]{.underline} (the risk of nuclear
accidents is another matter) \[77\]. [If each side has a secure second
strike]{.underline}---or even a minimal deterrent with some nonzero
chance of launching a few missiles---[then each side can expect to gain
little and lose much by fighting a nuclear war.]{.underline} Whereas the
costs of conventional war can be more mysterious because each side might
decide to hold something back and meter out its punishment due to some
internal constraint or a theory of graduated escalation, even a modest
initial nuclear exchange is recognized to be extremely costly. As long
as both sides understand this and understand (or believe) that the
adversary understands this as well, then the relationship is stable.
Countries engage nuclear powers with considerable deference, especially
over issues of fundamental national or international importance. At the
same time, nuclear weapons appear to be of limited value in prosecuting
aggressive action, especially over issues of secondary or tertiary
importance, or in response to aggression from others at lower levels of
dispute intensity. Nuclear weapons are best used for signaling a
willingness to run serious risks to protect or extort some issue that is
considered of vital national interest. As mentioned previously, both
superpowers in the Cold War considered the warfighting advantages of
nuclear weapons quite apart from any deterrent effect, and the United
States and Russia still do. High-altitude bursts for air defense,
electromagnetic pulse for frying electronics, underwater detonations for
anti-submarine warfare, hardened target penetration, area denial, and so
on, have some battlefield utility. Transparency per se is less important
than weapon effects for warfighting uses, and can even be deleterious
for tactics that depend on stealth and mobility. Even a single tactical
nuke, however, would inevitably be a political event. Survivability of
the second strike deterrent can also militate against transparency, as
in the case of the Soviet Perimeter system, as mobility, concealment,
and deception can make it harder for an observer to track and count
respective forces from space. Counterforce strategies, platform
diversity and mobility, ballistic missile defense systems, and force
employment doctrine can all make it more difficult for one or both sides
in a crisis to know whether an attack is likely to succeed or fail. The
resulting uncertainty affects not only estimates of relative
capabilities but also the degree of confidence in retaliation. At the
same time, there is reason to believe that platform diversity lowers the
risk of nuclear or conventional contests, because increasing the number
of types of delivery platforms heightens second strike survivability
without increasing the lethality of an initial strike \[78\]. While
transparency is not itself a requirement for nuclear use, stable
deterrence benefits to the degree to which retaliation can be
anticipated, as well as the likelihood that the consequences of a first
strike are more costly than any benefit. Cyber operations, in contrast,
are neither robust to revelation nor as obviously destructive. The cyber
commitment problem Deterrence (and compellence) uses force or threats of
force to "warn" an adversary about consequences if it takes or fails to
take an action. In contrast, defense (and conquest) uses force to "win"
a contest of strength and change the material distribution of power.
Sometimes militaries can change the distribution of information and
power at the same time. Military mobilization in a crisis signifies
resolve and displays a credible warning, but it also makes it easier to
attack or defend if the warning fails. Persistence in a battle of
attrition not only bleeds an adversary but also reveals a willingness to
pay a higher price for victory. More often, however, the informational
requirements of winning and warning are in tension. Combat performance
often hinges on well-kept secrets, feints, and diversions. Many military
plans and capabilities degrade when revealed. National security involves
trade-offs between the goals of preventing war, by advertising
capabilities or interests, and improving fighting power should war break
out, by concealing capabilities and surprising the enemy. The need to
conceal details of the true balance of power to preserve battlefield
effectiveness gives rise to the military commitment problem \[79, 80\].
Japan could not coerce the United States by revealing its plan to attack
Pearl Harbor because the United States could not credibly promise to
refrain from reorienting defenses and dispersing the Pacific Fleet. War
resulted not just because of what opponents did not know but because of
what they could not tell each other without paying a severe price in
military advantage. The military benefits of surprise (winning) trumped
the diplomatic benefits of coercion (warning). Cyber operations, whether
for disruption and intelligence, are extremely constrained by the
military commitment problem. Revelation of a cyber threat in advance
that is specific enough to convince a target of the validity of the
threat also provides enough information potentially to neutralize it.
Stuxnet took years and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop but
was patched within weeks of its discovery. The Snowden leaks negated a
whole swath of tradecraft that the NSA took years to develop. States may
use other forms of covert action, such as publicly disavowed lethal aid
or aerial bombing (e.g. Nixon's Cambodia campaign), to discretely signal
their interests, but such cases can only work to the extent that
revelation of operational details fails to disarm rebels or prevent
airstrikes \[81\]. Cyber operations, especially against NC3, must be
conducted in extreme secrecy as a condition of the efficacy of the
attack. Cyber tradecraft relies on stealth, stratagem, and deception
\[21\]. Operations tailored to compromise complex remote targets require
extensive intelligence, planning and preparation, and testing to be
effective. Actions that alert a target of an exploit allow the target to
patch, reconfigure, or adopt countermeasures that invalidate the plan.
As the Defense Science Board points out, competent network defenders:
can also be expected to employ highly-trained system and network
administrators, and this operational staff will be equipped with
continuously improving network defensive tools and techniques (the same
tools we advocate to improve our defenses). Should an adversary discover
an implant, it is usually relatively simple to remove or disable. For
this reason, offensive cyber will always be a fragile capability. \[41\]
The world's most advanced cyber powers, the United States, Russia,
Israel, China, France, and the United Kingdom, are also nuclear states,
while India, Pakistan, and North Korea also have cyber warfare programs.
NC3 is likely to be an especially well defended part of their cyber
infrastructures. NC3 is a hard target for offensive operations, which
thus requires careful planning, detailed intelligence, and long
lead-times to avoid compromise. Cyberspace is further ill-suited for
signaling because cyber operations are complex, esoteric, and hard for
commanders and policymakers to understand. Most targeted cyber
operations have to be tailored for each unique target (a complex
organization not simply a machine), quite unlike a general purpose
munition tested on a range. Malware can fail in many ways and produce
unintended side effects, as when the Stuxnet code was accidentally
released to the public. The category of "cyber" includes tremendous
diversity: irritant scams, hacktivist and propaganda operations,
intelligence collection, critical infrastructure disruption, etc. Few
intrusions create consequences that rise to the level of attacks such as
Stuxnet or BlackEnergy, and even they pale beside the harm imposed by a
small war. Vague threats are less credible because they are
indistinguishable from casual bluffing. Ambiguity can be useful for
concealing a lack of capability or resolve, allowing an actor to pool
with more capable or resolved states and acquiring some deterrence
success by association. But this works by discounting the costliness of
the threat. Nuclear threats, for example, are usually somewhat veiled
because one cannot credibly threaten nuclear suicide. The consistently
ambiguous phrasing of US cyber declaratory policy (e.g. "we will respond
to cyber-attacks in a manner and at a time and place of our choosing
using appropriate instruments of U.S. power" \[82\]) seeks to operate
across domains to mobilize credibility in one area to compensate for a
lack of credibility elsewhere, specifically by leveraging the greater
robustness to revelation of military capabilities other than cyber. This
does not mean that cyberspace is categorically useless for signaling,
just as nuclear weapons are not categorically useless for warfighting.
Ransomware attacks work when the money extorted to unlock the
compromised host is priced below the cost of an investigation or
replacing the system. The United States probably gained some benefits in
general deterrence (i.e. discouraging the emergence of challenges as
opposed to immediate deterrence in response to a challenge) through the
disclosure of Stuxnet and the Snowden leaks. Both revelations
compromised tradecraft, but they also advertised that the NSA probably
had more exploits and tradecraft where they came from. Some cyber
operations may actually be hard to mitigate within tactically meaningful
timelines (e.g. hardware implants installed in hard-to-reach locations).
Such operations might be revealed to coerce concessions within the
tactical window created by a given operation, if the attacker can
coordinate the window with the application of coercion in other domains.
As a general rule, however, the cyber domain on its own is better suited
for winning than warning \[83\]. Cyber and nuclear weapons fall on
extreme opposite sides of this spectrum. Dangerous complements Nuclear
weapons have been used in anger twice---against the Japanese cities
Hiroshima and Nagasaki---but cyberspace is abused daily. Considered
separately, the nuclear domain is stable and the cyber domain is
unstable. In combination, the results are ambiguous. The nuclear domain
can bound the intensity of destruction that a cyber attacker is willing
to inflict on an adversary. US declaratory policy states that
unacceptable cyber attacks may prompt a military response; while nuclear
weapons are not explicitly threatened, neither are they withheld.
Nuclear threats have no credibility at the low end, where the bulk of
cyber attacks occur. This produces a cross-domain version of the
stability--instability paradox, where deterrence works at the high end
but is not credible, and thus encourages provocation, at low
intensities. Nuclear weapons, and military power generally, create an
upper bound on cyber aggression to the degree that retaliation is
anticipated and feared \[22, 83, 84\]. In the other direction, the
unstable cyber domain can undermine the stability of nuclear deterrence.
Most analysts who argue that the cyber--nuclear combination is a recipe
for danger focus on the fog of crisis decision making \[85--87\].
Stephen Cimbala points out that today's relatively smaller nuclear
arsenals may perversely magnify the attractiveness of NC3 exploitation
in a crisis: "Ironically, the downsizing of U.S. and post-Soviet Russian
strategic nuclear arsenals since the end of the Cold War, while a
positive development from the perspectives of nuclear arms control and
nonproliferation, makes the concurrence of cyber and nuclear attack
capabilities more alarming" \[88\]. Cimbala focuses mainly on the [risks
of **misperception** and **miscalculation**]{.underline} that [emerge
when a cyber attack muddies the **transparent
communication**]{.underline} [required for opponents to understand one
another's interests, redlines, and willingness to use force, and to
ensure reliable control over subordinate commanders. Thus a nuclear
actor "faced with a sudden burst of **holes**]{.underline} [in its vital
warning and response systems might, for example, press the **preemption
button** instead of **waiting to ride out the attack and then
retaliate**]{.underline}" \[85\]. [The outcome of fog of decision
scenarios such as these depend on how humans react to risk and
uncertainty]{.underline}, which in turn depends on bounded rationality
and organizational frameworks that might confuse rational decision
making \[89, 90\]. These factors exacerbate a hard problem. Yet within a
rationalist framework, cyber attacks that have already created their
effects need not trigger an escalatory spiral. While being handed a fait
accompli may trigger an aggressive reaction, it is also plausible that
the target's awareness that its NC3 has been compromised in some way
would help to convey new information that the balance of power is not as
favorable as previously thought. This in turn could encourage the target
to accommodate, rather than escalate. While defects in rational decision
making are a serious concern in any cyber--nuclear scenario, the
situation becomes even more hazardous when there are rational incentives
to escalate. Although "known unknowns" can create confusion, to
paraphrase Donald Rumsfeld, the "unknown unknowns" are perhaps more
dangerous. [A successful clandestine penetration of NC3 can **defeat the
informational symmetry that stabilizes nuclear
relationships**.]{.underline} [Nuclear weapons are useful for deterrence
because they impose a degree of **consensus** about the distribution of
power; each side knows the other can inflict prohibitive levels of
damage, even if they may disagree about the precise extent of this
damage. Cyber operations are attractive **precisely because they can
secretly revise the distribution of power**]{.underline}. [NC3
neutralization]{.underline} may be an expensive and rarified capability
in the reach of only a few states with mature signals intelligence
agencies, but it [is much cheaper than nuclear attack]{.underline}. Yet
the very usefulness of cyber operations for nuclear warfighting ensure
that deterrence failure during brinksmanship crises is more likely.
[[Nuclear states may initiate crises of risk and
resolve]{.underline}]{.mark} to see who will back down first, which is
not always clear in advance. Chicken appears viable, ironically,
be[cause each player understands that a nuclear war would be a disaster
for all, and thus all can agree that someone can be expected
swerve.]{.underline} Nuclear deterrence should ultimately make dealing
with an adversary diplomatically more attractive than fighting, provided
that fighting is costly---as would seem evident for the prospect of
nuclear war---and assuming that bargains are available to states willing
to accept compromise rather than annihilation. [If, however, one side
knows, but the other does not, that the attacker has disabled the
target's ability to perceive an impending military attack, or to react
to one]{.underline} when it is underway, then [they will not have a
shared understanding of the probable outcome of war, even in broad
terms.]{.underline} Consider a brinksmanship crisis between two nuclear
states where only one has realized a successful penetration of the
rival's NC3. The cyber attacker knows that it has a military advantage,
but it cannot reveal the advantage to the target, lest the advantage be
lost. The target does not know that it is at a disadvantage, and it
cannot be told by the attacker for the same reason. The attacker
perceives an imbalance of power while the target perceives a balance. A
dangerous competition in risk taking ensues. The first side knows that
it does not need to back down. The second side feels confident that it
can stand fast and raise the stakes far beyond what it would be willing
to if it understood the true balance of power. Each side is willing to
escalate to create more risk for the other side, making it more likely
that one or the other will conclude that deterrence has failed and move
into warfighting mode to attempt to limit the damage the other can
inflict. The targeted nature and uncertain effects of offensive cyber
operations put additional pressure on decision makers. An intrusion will
probably disable only part of the enemy's NC3 architecture, not all of
it (which is not only operationally formidable to achieve but also more
likely to be noticed by the target). Thus the target may retain control
over some nuclear forces, or conventional forces. The target may be
tempted to use some of them piecemeal to signal a willingness to
escalate further, even though it cannot actually escalate because of the
cyber operation. The cyber attacker knows that it has escalation
dominance, but when even a minor demonstration by the target can cause
great damage, it is tempting to preempt this move or others like it.
This situation would be especially unstable if only second strike but
not primary strike NC3 was incapacitated. Uncertainty in the efficacy of
the clandestine penetration would discount the attacker's confidence in
its escalation dominance, with a range of possible outcomes. Enough
uncertainty would discount the cyber attack to nothing, which would have
a stabilizing effect by returning the crisis to the pure nuclear domain.
A little bit of uncertainty about cyber effectiveness would heighten
risk acceptance while also raising the incentives to preempt as an
insurance measure. [Adding]{.underline}
**[[allies]{.underline}]{.mark}** [into the mix **[introduce]{.mark}**s
[**additional** instability]{.mark}]{.underline}. An ally emboldened by
its nuclear umbrella might run provocative risks that it would be much
more reluctant to embrace if it was aware that the umbrella was actually
full of holes. Conversely, if the clandestine advantage is held by the
state extending the umbrella, allies could become unnerved by the
willingness of their defender to run what appear to be outsize risks,
oblivious of the reasons for the defender's confidence, creating discord
in the alliance and incentives for self-protective action, leading to
greater uncertainty about alliance solidarity. The direction of
influence between the cyber and nuclear realms depends to large degree
on which domain is the main arena of action. Planning and conducting
cyber operations will be bounded by the ability of aggressors to
convince themselves that attacks will remain secret, and by the
confidence of nuclear nations in their invulnerability. Fears of
cross-domain escalation will tend to keep instability in cyberspace
bounded. However, if a crisis has risen to the point where nuclear
threats are being seriously considered or made, then NC3 exploitation
will be destabilizing. Brinksmanship crises seem to have receded in
frequency since the Cuban Missile Crisis but may be more likely than is
generally believed. President Vladimir Putin of Russia has insinuated
more than once in recent years that his government is willing to use
tactical nuclear weapons if necessary to support his policies. Cyber
power and nuclear stability Not all crises are the same. Indeed, their
very idiosyncrasies create the uncertainties that make bargaining
failure more likely \[75\]. So far our analysis would be at home in the
Cold War, with the technological novelty of cyber operations. Yet not
every state has the same cyber capabilities or vulnerabilities.
Variation in cyber power relations across dyads should be expected to
affect the strategic stability of nuclear states. The so-called second
nuclear age differs from superpower rivalry in important ways \[91\].
There are fewer absolute numbers of warheads in the world, down from a
peak of over 70 000 in the 1980s to about 15 000 today (less than 5000
deployed), but they are distributed very unevenly \[92\]. The United
States and Russia have comparably sized arsenals, each with a fully
diversified triad of delivery platforms, while North Korea only has a
dozen or so bombs and no meaningful delivery system (for now). China,
India, Pakistan, Britain, France, and Israel have modest arsenals in the
range of several dozen to a couple hundred weapons, but they have very
different doctrines, conventional force complements, domestic political
institutions, and alliance relationships. The recent nuclear powers lack
the hard-won experience and shared norms of the Cold War to guide them
through crises, and even the United States and Russia have much to
relearn. Cyber warfare capacity also varies considerably across
contemporary nuclear nations. The United States, Russia, Israel, and
Britain are in the top tier, able to run sophisticated, persistent,
clandestine penetrations. China is a uniquely active cyber power with
ambitious cyber warfare doctrine, but its operational focus is on
economic espionage and political censorship, resulting in less refined
tradecraft and more porous defenses for military purposes \[16\].
France, India, and Pakistan also have active cyber warfare programs,
while North Korea is the least developed cyber nation, depending on
China for its expertise \[93\]. It is beyond the scope of this article
to assess crisis dyads in detail, and data on nuclear and cyber power
for these countries are shrouded in secrecy. Here, as a way of summing
up the arguments above, we offer a few conjectures about how stylized
aspects of cyber power affect crisis stability through incentives and
key aspects of decision making. We do not stress relative nuclear weapon
capabilities on the admittedly strong (and contestable) assumption that
nuclear transparency in the absence of cyber operations would render
nuclear asymmetry irrelevant for crisis bargaining because both sides
would agree about the terrible consequences of conflict \[94\]. We also
omit domestic or psychological variables that affect relative power
assessments, although these are obviously important. Even if neither
India nor Pakistan have viable cyber--nuclear capabilities,
brinksmanship between them is dangerous for many other reasons, notably
compressed decision timelines, Pakistan's willingness to shoot first,
and domestic regime instability. Our focus is on the impact of offensive
and defensive cyber power on nuclear deterrence above and beyond the
other factors that certainly play a role in real-world outcomes. First,
does the cyber attacker have the organizational capacity, technical
expertise, and intelligence support to "compromise" the target's NC3?
Can hackers access critical networks, exploit technical vulnerabilities,
and confidently execute a payload to disrupt or exploit strategic
sensing, command, forces, or transport capacity? The result would be
some tangible advantage for warfighting, such as tactical warning or
control paralysis, but one that cannot be exercised in bargaining.
Second, is the target able to "detect" the compromise of its NC3? The
more complicated and sensitive the target, the more likely cyber
attackers are to make a mistake that undermines the intrusion.
Attribution is not likely to be difficult given the constricted pool of
potential attackers, but at the same time the consequences of
misattributing "false flag" operations could be severe \[95\]. At a
minimum, detection is assumed to provide information to the target that
the balance of power is perhaps not as favorable as imagined previously.
We assume that detection without an actual compromise is possible
because of false positives or deceptive information operations designed
to create pessimism or paranoia. Third, is the target able to "mitigate"
the compromise it detects? Revelation can prompt patching or network
reconfiguration to block an attack, but this assumption is not always
realistic. The attacker may have multiple pathways open or may have
implanted malware that is difficult to remove in tactically meaningful
timelines. In such cases the cyber commitment problem is not absolute,
since the discovery of the power to hurt does not automatically disarm
it. Successful mitigation here is assumed to restore mutual assessments
of the balance of power to what they would be absent the cyber attack.
Table 1 shows how these factors combine to produce different deterrence
outcomes in a brinksmanship (chicken) crisis. If there is no cyber
compromise and the target detects nothing (no false positives) then we
have the optimistic ideal case where nuclear transparency affords stable
"deterrence." Transparency about the nuclear balance, including the
viability of secure second strike forces, provides strategic stability.
We also expect this box to describe situations where the target has
excellent network defense capabilities and thus the prospect of defense,
denial or deception successfully deters any attempts to penetrate NC3.
This may resemble the Cold War situation (with electronic warfare in
lieu of cyber), or even the present day US--Russia dyad, where the odds
of either side pulling off a successful compromise against a highly
capable defender are not favorable. Alternately the attack may be deemed
risky enough to encourage serious circumspection. However, the existence
of Canopy Wing does not encourage optimism in this regard. \[\[TABLE 1
OMITTED\]\] Conversely, if there is a compromise that goes undetected,
then there is a heightened risk of "war" because of the cyber commitment
problem. This box may be particularly relevant for asymmetric dyads such
as the United States and North Korea, where one side has real cyber
power but the other side is willing to go to the brink where it
believes, falsely, that it has the capability to compel its counterpart
to back down. Cyber disruption of NC3 is attractive for damage
limitation should deterrence fail, given that the weaker state's
diminutive arsenal makes damage limitation by the stronger state more
likely to succeed. The dilemma for the stronger state is that the
clandestine counterforce hedge, which makes warfighting success more
likely, is precisely what makes deterrence more likely to fail. The
United States would face similar counterforce dilemmas with other dyads
like China or even Russia, although even a strong cyber power should be
more circumspect when confronted with an adversary with a larger/more
capable nuclear and conventional arsenal. More complex and cyber savvy
targets, moreover, are more likely to detect a breach in NC3, leading to
more ambiguous outcomes depending on how actors cope with risk and
uncertainty. Paradoxically, confidence in cyber security may be a major
contributor to failure; believing one is safe from attack increases the
chance that an attack is successful. If the successful compromise is
detected but not mitigated, then the target learns that the balance of
power is not as favorable as thought. This possibility suggests fleeting
opportunities for "coercion" by revealing the cyber coup to the target
in the midst of a crisis while the cyber attacker maintains or develops
a favorable military advantage before the target has the opportunity to
reverse or compensate the NC3 disruption. Recognizing the newly
transparent costs of war, a risk neutral or risk averse target should
prefer compromise. The coercive advantages (deterrence or compellence)
of a detected but unmitigated NC3 compromise will likely be fleeting.
This suggests a logical possibility for creating a window of opportunity
for using particular cyber operations that are more robust to revelation
as a credible signal of superior capability in the midst of a crisis. It
would be important to exploit this fleeting advantage via other credible
military threats (e.g. forces mobilized on visible alert or deployed
into the crisis area) before the window closes. One side may be able
gain an unearned advantage, an opportunity for coercion via a "bluff,"
by the same window-of-opportunity logic. A target concerned about NC3
compromise will probably have some network monitoring system and other
protections in place. Defensive systems can produce false positives as a
result of internal errors or a deception operation by the attacker to
encourage paranoia. It is logically possible that some false positives
would appear to the target to be difficult to mitigate. In this
situation, the target could believe it is at a disadvantage, even though
this is not in fact the case. This gambit would be operationally very
difficult to pull off with any reliability in a real nuclear crisis.
Cyber--nuclear coercion and bluffing strategies are fraught with danger.
Detection without mitigation might put a risk-acceptant or loss-averse
target into a "use-lose" situation, creating pressures to preempt or
escalate. The muddling of decision-making heightens the risk of
accidents or irrational choices in a crisis scenario. Worry about
preemption or accident then heightens the likelihood that the initiator
will exercise counterforce options while they remain available. These
pressures can be expected to be particularly intense if the target's
detection is only partial or has not revealed the true extent of damage
to its NC3 (i.e. the target does not realize it has already lost some or
all of what it hopes to use). These types of scenarios are most usually
invoked in analyses of inadvertent escalation \[23--27\]. The essential
distinction between "use-lose" risks and "war" in this typology is the
target's knowledge of some degree of NC3 compromise. Use-lose and other
cognitive pressures can certainly result in nuclear war, since the
breakdown of deterrence leads to the release of nuclear weapons, but we
distinguish these outcomes to highlight the different decision making
processes or rational incentives at work. A "spiral" of mistrust may
emerge if one side attempts a compromise but the defender detects and
mitigates it. Both sides again have common mutual estimates of the
relative balance of power, which superficially resembles the
"deterrence" case because the NC3 compromise is negated. Unfortunately,
the detection of the compromise will provide the target with information
about the hostile intentions of the cyber attacker. This in turn is
likely to exacerbate other political or psychological factors in the
crisis itself or in the crisis-proneness of the broader relationship.
The strange logical case where there is no compromise but one is
detected and mitigated could result from a false positive misperception
(including a third-party false flag operation) that could conflict
spiraling \[96, 97\]. The bluff and coercion outcomes are also likely to
encourage spiraling behavior once the fleeting bargaining advantage
dissipates or is dispelled (provided anyone survives the interaction).
The risk of crisis instability is not the same for all dyads. It is
harder to compromise the NC3 of strong states because of the redundancy
and active defenses in their arsenal. Likewise, strong states are better
able to compromise the NC3 of any states but especially of weaker
states, because of strong states' greater organizational capacity and
expertise in cyber operations. Stable deterrence or MAD is most likely
to hold in mutually strong dyads (e.g. [the United States
and]{.underline} the Soviet Union in the Cold War or
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** today to a lesser extent). Deterrence
is slightly less likely in other equally matched dyads
(**[[India--Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}**) where defensive
vulnerabilities create temptations but offensive capabilities may not be
sufficient to exploit them. Most states can be expected to refrain from
targeting American NC3 given a US reputation for cyber power (a general
deterrence benefit enhanced by Stuxnet and Snowden). The situation is
less stable if the United States is the attacker. The most dangerous
dyad is a stronger and a weaker state (United States and **[[North
Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}** or **[[Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[and]{.underline} **[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}**). [Dyads involving
strong and middle powers are]{.underline} also
**[dangerous]{.underline}** ([United States and **China**]{.underline}).
[The stronger side is tempted to disrupt NC3 as a warfighting hedge in
case deterrence breaks down, while the weaker but still formidable side
has a reasonable chance at detection. The marginally weaker may also be
tempted to subvert NC3, particularly for reconnaissance; the stronger
side is more likely to detect and correct the intrusion but will be
alarmed by]{.underline} the [ambiguity]{.underline} in distinguishing
intelligence collection from attack planning \[98\]. [[In a
**brinksmanship crisis**]{.underline}]{.mark} between them, [[windows
for coercion may be **available yet fleeting**]{.underline}, [with

operations]{.underline} can also **[increase
vulnerabilities]{.underline}**; for example, secretly stockpiling
information about vulnerabilities in computers for later exploitation,
rather than publicizing and helping civil society to mitigate those
vulnerabilities, leaves critical infrastructure vulnerable to attack.
The skills and organizational capabilities for offense and defense are
very similar. Defense requires understanding how to compromise computer
systems; one of the best ways to protect computer systems is to engage
in penetration testing (i.e., controlled offensive operations on one's
own systems). [The similarity between offensive and defensive skills
makes it **unnecessary to conduct offensive operations** against
adversaries to maintain offensive capability.]{.underline} Thus, rather
than stockpiling technologies in the hope of gaining offensive
advantage, states should develop the skills and organizational
capabilities required to innovate and maintain information and
communications technologies. Managing Complexity The complexity of
information systems gives the offense certain advantages for purely
probabilistic reasons. [Imagine a race: offense and defense go hunting
for randomly distributed vulnerabilities, with the offense attempting to
exploit those vulnerabilities and the defense aiming to patch them. The
number of [vulnerabilities grows with]{.mark} the **[size and
complexity]{.mark}** of the computer system]{.underline}, as do the
technological advantages of offense---at least in principle. [With a
vast number of vulnerabilities, [it is **unlikely** that the defense
will]{.mark} be able to find and [patch every vulnerability]{.mark}
before the offense finds and exploits it.]{.underline} Technology is,
however, embedded in social organizations, and organizations can help
the defense better manage complexity. Those that develop software can
check for common errors before making hardware-software systems
available for use. [The defender has complete access to its computer
system, whereas the attacker has a more limited set of attack
vectors.]{.underline} Organizations can help skilled defenders by
establishing good cybersecurity processes, such as continually scanning
for vulnerabilities and updating software. Assessing Kinetic Effects To
date, failures of cyber defense have largely been failures of
management, and the successes of offense are a result of its relatively
simpler goals. [[Offense]{.mark}, like defense, [becomes more difficult
as]{.mark} its [goals become]{.mark} more [complex]{.mark}.]{.underline}
In particular, the advantages that complexity offers the offense in
cyberspace diminish in the physical world. [Computers controlling
physical machinery can be hacked, but achieving particular physical
effects, such as covertly sabotaging nuclear enrichment facilities,
requires knowledge of the physical processes that the computers control,
not merely knowledge of the computers. Much of the detailed knowledge
needed to run an industrial control system is tacit]{.underline}, passed
from one engineer to another but never written down, let alone stored on
a computer. [Gathering such information requires traditional espionage
by humans on the ground, which is both expensive and risky]{.underline}.
A cost-benefit analysis of Stuxnet for both the offense and the defense
demonstrates why [[damaging]{.mark} physical [infrastructure is **more
costly** than]{.mark} simply [infiltrating]{.mark} information
[networks]{.mark}. The costs of Stuxnet were likely far greater for the
offense (the United States and Israel) than for the defense (Iran), and
[Stuxnet was]{.mark} relatively [ineffective, setting back
Iran's]{.mark} nuclear [program by fewer than three
months]{.mark}]{.underline}. The great expense of Stuxnet was
intelligence; though digital espionage can be used to obtain some kinds
of information, the knowledge needed to disrupt a physical control
system, such as the detailed methods and settings used to control
pressure in Iran's nuclear centrifuges, is not generally held in
computers. The costs for both sides are dominated not by technology but
by skilled labor---for example, hackers who identify and exploit
zero-day vulnerabilities, systems administrators who manage and defend
computer systems, and the nuclear engineers who understand enrichment
processes and the means of disrupting them. In addition, assessing costs
alone is misguided: [the perceived benefits of attacking with and
defending from Stuxnet (i.e., the value of Iran's nuclear weapons
program) greatly exceeded the costs for both the offense and the
defense]{.underline}. This is one reason not to be complacent about the
need to secure industrial control systems and critical infrastructure:
[though cyberattacks on such systems will be costly, [a determined
adversary may be **willing to pay the cost**]{.mark} to achieve its
aims]{.underline}. Conclusion The common assumption that the offense
dominates cyberspace is dangerous and deeply misguided. The
offense-defense balance can be assessed only for specific operations,
not for all of cyberspace, as it is shaped by the capabilities of
adversaries and the complexity of their goals in any conflict. When it
comes to exerting precise physical effects, [cyberspace **does not offer
overwhelming advantages** to the offense]{.underline}. Because the
capabilities of offense and defense are similar, [improving [defensive
operations allows preparation]{.mark} for cyber offense [without
**risking geopolitical instability**]{.mark} or increasing vulnerability
to attack.]{.underline}

"In cyberspace, the offense has the upper hand." 1 These words, written
in 2010 by Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn, reflect
conventional wisdom among military officers, policymakers, and scholars.
2 A minority of scholars disagree. 3 Nonetheless, [[the]{.mark}
prevalent [belief that cyberspace favors]{.mark} the [offense]{.mark}
has major consequences for **international security**]{.underline}.
According to offense-defense theory, [state perceptions that technology
favors the offense [increase fears of attack **encourage arms
races**]{.mark}, and through interactions between fears [and]{.mark}
capabilities, **[increase the likelihood]{.mark} and consequences [of
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 4 [[Overconfidence in]{.mark} the
[advantages]{.mark} of offense can [create a "cult of the offensive"
with]{.mark} potentially **[tragic results]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 5
Many of [these dynamics appear to be at work with cyber
conflict.]{.underline} Military leaders perceive cyberspace as favoring
the offense and are seeking more discretion to conduct offensive cyber
operations. 6 Cyberattack features prominently in the U.S. intelligence
community's list of global threats. 7 In 2012 Defense Secretary Leon
Panetta warned of a potential "cyber-Pearl Harbor." 8 [Fears of being
hacked, optimism about hacking others, or both have spurred massive
investments in military [cyber operations]{.mark} around the world,
suggesting a cyber arms race]{.underline}. 9 Because [cyber operations
can [**blur lines** between espionage]{.mark} (or "cyber exploitation")
[and use of force]{.mark} (or "cyberattack"), they create a
"cybersecurity dilemma]{.underline}," wherein network intrusions
undertaken for defensive purposes are easily misunderstood as
preparation for an attack, [**[creating the risk of escalation]{.mark}**
and use of force.]{.underline} 10

#### [Undermines norms]{.underline} and causes [kinetic]{.underline} warfare.

US ambivalence toward cyber war is both strategic and normative, the
implication being that what is bad for the United States is also bad for
the world. [Washington insists that any cyber operations it might
conduct would be 'in a manner **consistent with US and international
law**]{.underline}**'**.5 Perceiving cyber war as war implies the
applicability of the laws of war, specifically the principles of
non-aggression, non-intervention, proportionality, discrimination and
respect for neutrality.6 [[Compliance with]{.mark} all these [norms
could be **challenging** when]{.mark} initiating and [conducting
offensive cyber war]{.mark}]{.underline}. Case in point: [the United
States]{.underline} and Israel [are said to have created and inserted
the Stuxnet worm to interfere with the control of centrifuges used by
Iran]{.underline} to enrich uranium. However justified by the imperative
of preventing Iran from building nuclear weapons, [it is fair to ask if
this act of cyber war was lawful]{.underline}, especially in light of
the unintended collateral effects it reportedly had. More broadly,
harming non-combatants and civilian life, which can occur when infecting
non-military computer systems, raises especially vexing issues, at least
for the United States -- thus its defensive posture. [There are
**several obvious reasons** for US wariness about offensive cyber
war]{.underline}. Firstly, US [[military]{.underline}]{.mark},
intelligence, economic, governmental and societal [[functions
are]{.mark} **highly [dependent on computer systems]{.mark}**[, and
vulnerable to]{.mark} their [disruption]{.mark} and
degradation.]{.underline} Put starkly, having led and benefited
enormously from the 'digital revolution', the United States regards
cyber war as counter-revolutionary. Moreover, [once begun, the course a
[cyber war]{.mark} might take [would be **hard to**]{.mark} **predict,
[control]{.mark} or contain**. [It could trigger **kinetic
hostilities**]{.mark}, visit indiscriminate harm on non-combatants,
[escalate]{.mark} far beyond what the belligerents intended, [and
cause]{.mark} grave [economic damage]{.mark}]{.underline}.7 Finally, US
superiority in conventional military capabilities limits the need for
cyber war, whereas enemies could use cyber war as an asymmetric answer
to such superiority. In other words, cyber war could level the
battlefield to the US disadvantage.

In contemporary defense policy discourse [there are three **influential
narratives** of mounting cyber peril, corresponding roughly to the three
operational modes of attack, exploitation, and defense.]{.underline} The
most dangerous scenarios envision the paralysis of industrial control
systems or military command and control through surprise attack by
anonymous hackers. [[The]{.mark} imagined [aggressor may be]{.mark} a
**revisionist state** like [China or Iran or a non-state]{.mark}
anarchist or [terrorist]{.mark} empowered by the information
revolution.]{.underline} A second narrative offers an alternative to the
shock of sudden catastrophe, warning instead of the long term erosion of
economic and military competitiveness drained away through persistent
computer espionage. The relentless theft of vital secrets stored on
corporate and government networks produces a "death by a thousand cuts"
as states give their firms an unfair commercial advantage and equip
their military forces with potent countermeasures to U.S. strengths. In
both of these scenarios, [[commercial]{.mark} hacking [tools]{.mark} and
ubiquitous connectivity [give]{.mark} weaker states and terr[orists
provide a **potent means** to exploit]{.mark} and attack the expanding
attack surface of digitally-dependent advanced [industrial
states]{.mark}]{.underline}. A third threat narrative concerns the
transformation of internet architecture to decisively benefit one
political group at the expense of the other. At one extreme, the growth
of flexible social media enables connected protesters to overwhelm and
overthrow authoritarian regimes.15 At the other extreme, authoritarian
governments censor internet content and reconfigure internet governance
to undermine the internet's potential for innovation and freedom. State
paranoia about the threats of paralysis and erosion thus leads to
digital lockout or "the end of the internet" as we know it.16 [[Threats
of]{.mark} catastrophic attack, omniscient [exploitation]{.mark}, and
unassailable defense are myths because they [imagine major rewards for
little cost.]{.mark} The actual [rewards of any]{.mark} given cyber
[campaign are **rarely**]{.mark} **so [great]{.mark}** and the c[osts
are rarely]{.mark} so [trivial]{.mark}. Potential [benefits]{.mark} of
attack [are **discounted by uncertainty** about the]{.mark} true [value
of the target]{.mark} to the adversary and the ability for the attacker
to take advantage of it. [**Operative costs** include]{.mark} the
bureaucratic resources, [development and testing]{.mark} requirements,
human capital, [and intelligence experience]{.mark} required to plan and
run an effective covert cyber campaign.]{.underline} Setting aside the
myths of low costs and high rewards (no free lunch), there are a variety
of more realistic cyber operations with significant variation in their
operative costs and benefits. A set of higher cost, and, potentially,
higher reward complements enhance the capabilities of stronger actors
who can master them. A much larger set of low cost, low reward irritants
are available to weaker actors or even solitary individuals, but they
provide only a small marginal return on a small investment.

### AT: Plan Secret\-\--2NC

#### Secrecy magnifies not diminishes the link

**Kuo, PhD Princeton, 19**

(Raymond, Secrecy among Friends: Covert Military Alliances and Portfolio
Consistency Journal of Conflict Resolution 1-27 ª The Author(s) 2019)

This literature provides little analytical traction because secret
alliances are conceptually distinct from covert communication. Most
obviously, mutual hostility---a prerequisite for Carson (2016), Carson
and Yarhi-Milo (2017), and Yarhi-Milo (2013)---does not exist among
"friendly" partners. The private diplomacy literature focuses on
short-term engagements of limited coordination, where adversaries seek
to avoid revelation and escalation to lend credibility to their signals.
But [[revelation and escalation]{.mark} are typically the [goals of
secret]{.mark} [alliances]{.mark},]{.underline} which formalize and
codify cooperative and often lasting relationships. As Bas and Schub
(2016) highlight, a significant proportion of hidden pacts are
offensive: they are designed to spread conflict. [[Even defensive
pacts]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Ritter (2004) discusses,
[[generate]{.mark} strategic [uncertainty]{.mark} and surprise, causing
allies to take less compromising position]{.underline}s. Indeed[, the
[hidden nature of covert pacts **undermines deterrence**]{.mark}**,
potentially [making conflict more likely]{.mark}**, in contrast to much
of secret diplomacy.]{.underline}

MPs. [Allies have launched a huge crackdown to prevent even more secrets
being passed]{.underline} to the Kremlin, the top Tory minister said.
The revelation came after Conservative MP Colonel Bob Stewart, who
commanded UN forces in Bosnia, accused Nato members of colluding with
Moscow in the 1990s. "[When something says \'Nato: secret\', that\'s the
**last bloody thing it is,"**]{.underline} he said. "[When I served in

The United States does have narrow laws that punish the disclosure of
certain kinds of very sensitive classified information, such as
information about CIA agents. However, these laws apply mainly to
government officials. [In the current controversy, [no one has
suggested]{.mark} that the journalist]{.underline} Robert [[Novak should
be sent to prison for publishing information]{.mark} he received [from
senior government officials]{.mark}. Under American law, there is no way
that Mr. Novak could be sent to prison. The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is a powerful country, and perhaps it is [in a
position to ignore NATO rules about **Penal Code provisions** for
unauthorized disclosure of classified information. A more likely

[[Turkey's state news agency]{.underline}]{.mark} on Tuesday
[[published]{.mark} the [locations of **secret US military bases** in

fellow NATO member states.]{.underline} In the latest display of
tensions between Turkey and other NATO member nations, Turkey's
state-run Anadolu news agency earlier this week published a detailed
report of the secret locations of US military bases, operational posts
and military posts inside Syria. The 620-word news report also included
the numbers of US soldiers and French special forces stationed at these
locations. **[The [unprecedented leaking of sensitive battlefield
information]{.mark}]{.underline}** by the state-run news agency
obviously **[[had official Turkish backing]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
according to Jasper Mortimer, FRANCE 24's Turkey correspondent.
"[[It]{.mark} certainly [was **intentional**]{.mark}. Anadolu agency is
the hand-servant of the \[Turkish\] government]{.underline}. It would
not have published this report without the green light from the top of
government," explained Mortimer, reporting from Ankara, adding that the
revelation of troop numbers was particularly serious. "War
correspondents do not give the number of troops in the unit to which
they are attached. That is seen as giving information to the enemy. But
here, Anadolu agency appears to have done exactly that."

#### Secrecy is the link, not a turn -psychological research proves leaks inevitable and will be more damaging

**Kuo, PhD Princeton, 19**

(Raymond, Secrecy among Friends: Covert Military Alliances and Portfolio
Consistency Journal of Conflict Resolution 1-27 ª The Author(s) 2019)

Furthermore, [portfolio consistency is a]{.underline} form of [network
effect]{.underline}. The [**pressure** to maintain secrecy scales with
the number of hidden]{.underline} partners or [obligations]{.underline}.
A state may face only small costs from reneging on one secret ally. But
[[when a state is embedded within]{.mark} overlapping [covert
alliances]{.mark}, it [faces]{.mark} [significant]{.mark} social
[pressure]{.mark} from several different actors [to maintain
secrecy]{.mark} in subsequent partnerships]{.underline}. Even a small
number of hidden allies can constrain defection by raising the risk of
wider network damage. [[Revelation of]{.mark} one set of [obligations
allows]{.mark}]{.underline} other partners and [[**adversaries** to
identify]{.mark} that alliance's [conditions]{.mark}**,
[reducing]{.mark} its strategic [utility]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
[potentially [disclosing]{.mark} the **wider [limits]{.mark}** [on an
actor's foreign policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly, the
extensiveness of hidden provisions can result in the same network
effect. Assuming that states hope to avoid conflicting commitments, they
must shape additional obligations around existing ones, creating an
"interlocking" set of provisions exclusive to each partner. Revelation
of one allows partners and adversaries better insight into additional
limits on the alliance's commitments or the conditions of other secret
treaties. Of course, some states may want contradictory obligations, as
Nazi Germany did. But maintaining secrecy then is even more important.
[Countries with [conflicting commitments]{.mark} will [suffer]{.mark}
**strategic, [reputational]{.mark}, policy**, and other [costs]{.mark}
[when]{.mark}ever any of their [pacts]{.mark} are
[invoked]{.mark}]{.underline}. Avoiding these costs for as long as
possible requires keeping all these obligations hidden. However,
contradictory commitments should be relatively rare. [The **[gains from
"fooling]{.mark}**" other countries [would have be substantial to
offset]{.mark} the **reputational and [strategic damage]{.mark}**
caused]{.underline}. In addition, [**extensive [research]{.mark} in
psychology** [finds]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[lying is **cognitively
more taxing**]{.mark} than telling the truth,]{.underline} particularly
if lies must also be mixed with truthful statements (Caso et al. 2005;
DePaulo et al. 2003; Gilbert 1991; Granhag and Strmwall 2002; Hartwig et

Vrij and Mann 2001; White and Burgoon 2001; Vrij et al. 2008). [As
[secret policy]{.mark} contradictions proliferate, as]{.underline} the
situations [they]{.underline} apply to **[[become]{.mark} more
[complex]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and as the number of hidden partners
increases, [the **[cognitive load]{.mark}** increases as well, [making
it]{.mark} much [easier]{.mark} for diplomats [to]{.mark}
**[inadvertently disclose]{.mark}** confidential
information.]{.underline}

## Turf Wars DA

### Turf Wars DA\-\--1NC

#### The plan's expansion of OCO's under Title 10 ignites legal [turf wars]{.underline}

**Smeets '20** \[Max; February 15; senior researcher at the Center for
Security Studies (CSS) and Affiliate at Stanford University Center for
International Security and Cooperation and Research Associate at the
Centre for Technology and Global Affairs, University of Oxford;
Intelligence and National Security, "U.S. cyber strategy of persistent
engagement & defend forward: implications for the alliance and
intelligence collection," 35:3\]

This means that [if U.S. Cyber Command seeks to operate only in 'red
space,' its activities will still have global reach. It also suggests
that red space grows as adversaries expand their operational
activity.]{.underline} Most importantly, this implies that if U.S. Cyber
Command seeks to achieve 'effects' in gray space, this will involve
operating infrastructure that adversaries do not control -- which is to
say those systems or networks on which adversaries merely have a
presence or are not active at all.

What is really new here? The United States has long operated in networks
'close to the adversary.' As Ben Buchanan's book, 'The Cybersecurity
Dilemma,' demonstrates, the U.S. has long acted as an observer outside
of its own networks, gathering intelligence of adversarial activity in
those others' networks.21 In fact, information has become public
concerning a case in which the Five Eyes collected intelligence about an
espionage platform (dubbed 'Snowglobe' by the Canadian Intelligence
Agency CSEC and 'Animal Farm' by Kaspersky Lab) of an allied country,
France, likely operating in adversarial networks in the Middle East.22
In other words, the practice of fourth-party collection is nothing
new.23 Furthermore, the U.S. has long acted in foreign non-adversarial
networks as a passerby, transiting through allied' networks to access an
adversarial network.

Yet, the new Cyber Command and Defense Department strategy changes the
nature of the U.S. military's behavior within those systems and
networks. Under the new strategy, [[Cyber Command wants to be an active
disrupter on those networks]{.underline}]{.mark}. It wants to achieve
effects -- that is to disrupt, deny, degrade, and/or destroy. The only
known precedent is U.S. Cyber Command operators wiping Islamic State
propaganda material off a server located in Germany.24 The German
government was notified in some fashion but not asked for advance
consent, causing much frustration.25 This will likely lead to a
systematic scaling up: U.S. Cyber Command now also seeks to be an active
disrupter on those networks 'globally, continuously and seamlessly' --
not regionally and sporadically.26

[[Out of network operations in allied networks]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[affect the **turf war between the NSA and Cyber
Command**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [[mostly critically Title 10 and Title
50 concerns]{.mark}.]{.underline}27 As Chesney summarizes:

From a legal perspective, the issue this \[case of Germany\] highlights
is that operations abroad implicate the UN Charter and related claims
about international law protection of sovereignty. \[...\]
[[Intelligence agencies can more easily act in this setting when
operating under Title 50 authority]{.mark}, as covert action status
carries with it a statutory obligation to comply with the U.S.
Constitution]{.underline} and U.S. statutes -- but no more than that.
**[[Title 10]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in contrast, **[[carries]{.mark}
with it [no such implicit statutory shield against]{.mark}
i]{.underline}**nternational **[law [objections]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[and of course [there is a general Defense Department policy]{.mark} of
international law compliance.]{.underline} Thus
**[[CYBERCOM]{.underline}]{.mark}** operating [[under Title 10 would run
into]{.underline}]{.mark} the full thicket of **[[international law
concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}**.28

Overall, it is expected that [**[operating in allied networks under
Title 10]{.underline}** [is likely to cause **more legal friction than
operating**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[under Title
50]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[[Before **Cyber Com**]{.mark}mand was created]{.underline}, some
members of the military argued that [[branch]{.mark}-specific [commands
could **not** provide]{.mark} an **[effective]{.mark}** cyberwar
**[response]{.mark} system**]{.underline}. They claimed the \"cultures
of today\'s military services are fundamentally incompatible with the
culture required to conduct cyberwarfare.\" And they contended that [the
**[\"core skills\"]{.mark}** needed to wage cyberwar [differ]{.mark}
radically from those needed for conventional war]{.underline}. Those who
subscribed to this view believed [the [better]{.mark} approach
[was]{.mark} to create [a **new**]{.mark}**, cyber-[specific]{.mark}**
[branch]{.mark}]{.underline} of the military [and assign it **overall
responsibility** for cyber operations]{.underline}, just as the Air
Force was assigned responsibility for air operations.

I suspect that view did not prevail because it would have required the
various branches to give up their cyber commands. Since it has for some
time been apparent that cyberspace can be used for military purposes, I
suspect the five branches were reluctant to give up the opportunity to
play a role in this new theatre of combat. I also suspect that the
proposal to create a new, cyber-specific branch of the U.S. military may
not have prevailed because it would have been difficult, if not
impossible, to implement. As we saw above, the rationale for the
different branches is that each is responsible for military activity in
a specific spatial domain in the physical world. While the divisions are
not precise, it is far easier to parse response authority in a spatial
context than it is with regard to cyberspace.

Cyberspace operations do not take place in a physical \[\*183\] place;
instead, they involve activity that occurs in and through computer
technology, which is pervasive in today\'s world. If the Department of
Defense had chosen to create a distinct branch with exclusive combat
authority in cyberspace, it would presumably mean this branch would take
command of any and all of the other branches\' activities that involved
cyberspace. It is difficult to see how this could be a viable strategy.
It would presumably mean, for example, that members of [the
cyberbranch]{.underline} would monitor, and probably control, the other
branches\' computers and online activities (i) [[to ensure]{.mark} a
**[baseline]{.mark}** of [security]{.mark}]{.underline} and (ii) to be
in a position to respond if and when the cyberbranch believed it
necessary to deter or respond to cyberwarfare attacks. That seems to be
the only way to functionally allocate operational responsibility in
cyberspace to a new, cyber-specific branch of the U.S. military.

If that is, indeed, the only way to accomplish this, then instead of
participating in a carefully-defined, complementary division of
responsibility, such as the one the existing branches currently
represent, the hypothesized cyberbranch would essentially subsume the
other branches as to its distinct area of responsibility. That could be
problematic. It might, for example, create clashes of authority that
could have negative consequences for the United States\' ability to
respond to cyber-attacks.

This might be one of the reasons the Department of Defense apparently
opted, instead, to create a distinct command that unified the cyberspace
components of the five traditional branches of the military. This
approach is fraught with its own problems, the most obvious of which is
coordinating the activities \[\*184\] of the five branch cyber commands.
If cyberspace were divisible into spatial operational domains, Cyber
Command could function in a fashion analogous to that of one of the
United States military\'s conventional Unified Combatant Commands. These
Commands incorporate personnel from the five military branches into a
unified command with responsibility for a specific geographical area.
The personnel assigned to such a Command respectively carry out the
functions that are within their branch\'s unique expertise, e.g., the
Navy carries out operations at sea, the Air Force conducts aerial
activities, and so forth.

As we saw above, cyberspace, unlike real space, cannot be parsed into
spatial domains. Unless that changes, Cyber Command faces the unenviable
task of trying to sort out what, precisely, should be the respective
responsibility of the Air Force, Army, Marine, and Navy cyber commands.
At the moment, it appears that at least these four cyber commands have
essentially the same mission, i.e., to conduct offensive and defensive
military operations in cyberspace. This is not only pointless, it is
likely to be counterproductive. Unfortunately, as we also saw above,
this state of affairs seems likely to continue for some time.

There is yet another issue Cyber Command must resolve. Since the task
list cited earlier focuses exclusively on (i) defending the military\'s
assets in cyberspace and (ii) directing and conducting military
operations in cyberspace, many wondered if the new Cyber Command was
only going to be responsible for \[\*185\] protecting military assets
and networks. In other words, would Cyber Command also be responsible
for protecting civilians and civilian-owned assets?

In the fall of 2010, the newly-appointed head of Cyber Command, General
Keith Alexander, told reporters the new unit did \"not have a role\" in
protecting civilian networks and cyber-assets. This caused controversy
because, as Part II noted, the military\'s role has historically been to
protect a state, its citizens, and their assets from external threats.
If General Alexander\'s comment was transposed to the context of kinetic
warfare, it would become a declaration that in the event of nuclear war
the U.S. military will protect itself but not civilians. Since that
proposition is completely inconsistent with the military\'s role in
society, it is not surprising that the General, at least to some extent,
retreated from that position in a statement he made the next day.

In testifying before the House Armed Services Committee, General
Alexander prosposed that Cyber Command \"could also have a broader role
in the civilian sector through protecting US critical infrastructure
networks and systems.\" He noted, though, that the White House \"was
examining the legal authority needed for Cyber Command to take
responsibility for protecting civilians and civilian-owned assets.\" A
few days later, the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland
Security perhaps sought to address this issue, at least in \[\*186\]
part, by signing a memorandum of understanding that (i) gives Homeland
Security \"lead responsibility for protecting the United States
government\'s civilian networks and critical infrastructure,\" (ii)
makes the Defense Department responsible for \"protecting some 15,000
military networks,\" and (iii) provides that the two will collaborate to
\"safeguard cyberspace against state as well as non-state actors.\"

General Alexander\'s comments and the memorandum of understanding
executed by the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security demonstrate
the doctrinal and institutional constraints that impede the U.S.\'s
ability to mount a unified response to cyber-threats. The primary
constraint is the bifurcation described in Part II: the military
(Defense) deals with war, while law enforcement (Homeland Security)
deals with crime and terrorism. Due to historical circumstance, the
bifurcation \[\*187\] implicitly assumes attacks from abroad target
nation-state assets and/or personnel while crime and terrorism target
civilian assets and/or personnel.

As we saw in Part II, that is not necessarily true as threats migrate
into cyberspace. [Civilians and [civilian]{.mark}-owned [assets
are]{.mark}]{.underline} already [[a target of
**cybercrime**]{.underline}]{.mark} and cyberterrorism, and it has for
some time been apparent that they will also be targets in cyberwarfare.
The bifurcation, though, does not allow (i) law enforcement officers to
retaliate against cyberwarfare attacks or (ii) members of the military
to retaliate against cybercrime and cyberterrorism. That is why General
Alexander could not assert that Cyber Command would protect civilians,
and that is why the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security found
it necessary to execute the memorandum of understanding noted above.

As matters currently stand, Cyber Command will have to utilize the
attribution processes described in Part II to determine, with the
necessary level of confidence, that a given attack was state-sponsored
before it can reciprocate in kind. Civilians and civilian assets have
been targets of conventional warfare, even though the law of armed
conflict calls for minimizing attacks on noncombatants. But those
attacks have come from an identified, nation-state enemy, which allowed
the targeted nation-state to respond in kind, even if the attack
occurred on its territory.

General Alexander\'s primary problem, therefore, is that it may be
impossible for the military to make such a determination for a
cyber-attack quickly enough for a timely response because \[\*188\] the
\"markers\" traditionally used to distinguish between internal and
external attacks are of little utility in the cyber context. This is
essentially a doctrinal problem, as it arises from the practice of
dividing threats into these two categories and categorically parsing
threat response authority between them. But as we saw earlier, General
Alexander also confronts an institutional problem: fusing six distinct
cyber commands into a coordinated, coherent cyber-response effort. We
will return to this issue in Part IV.

As we will see below, United States law enforcement confronts a
correlate doctrinal problem and operates in a far more complex
institutional structure.

B. Law Enforcement

As we saw in Part II, law enforcement is charged with controlling the
\"other\" threat: the threat to internal order that arises from
antisocial conduct on the part of individuals who are \"in\" the
territory of the state under whose authority law enforcement officers
operate. Some countries have a national penal code and a national police
agency that enforces that code. But because it is a federal state, the
United States has an essentially two-tiered system of penal laws and a
two-tiered law enforcement structure.

As to the former, the United States has fifty-two distinct \[\*189\]
criminal codes (one for each state, one for the District of Columbia and
a federal criminal code). These codes require a corresponding,
two-tiered law enforcement structure: one tier consists of the over
15,000 state and local agencies that respectively enforce state criminal
codes. Their geographical jurisdiction is generally linked to the nature
of the agency in which they serve: state police have jurisdiction
throughout the state, a county sheriff has jurisdiction in that county,
and municipal police have jurisdiction within the territorial boundaries
of their municipality.

The other tier is composed of agencies that enforce federal law. Five of
them - the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the \[\*190\] U.S. Secret
Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the
Drug Enforcement Administration, and U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement - are primarily responsible for pursing those who violate
the federal criminal code. And because these agencies operate under the
authority of the federal government, they have national jurisdiction,
i.e., their agents can pursue investigations anywhere that is within the
\"maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the U.S.\" and, under certain
circumstances, abroad.

It may seem that this complex enforcement structure, with its
often-overlapping federal and state jurisdiction, must inevitably
generate turf wars that impede the efficient enforcement of the law. The
likelihood that rivalry will occur between state and local law
enforcement agencies is mitigated, at least to some extent, by the fact
that each has a clearly defined geographical jurisdiction within which
it operates. This reduces, but does not eliminate, the potential for
inter-agency conflicts. Instances can and do arise in which, say, the
State Police \[\*191\] and the County Sheriff both have jurisdiction in
a given matter, which can create conflicts as to who should take the
lead. Over the last few years, state and local agencies have used
multi-jurisdictional task forces to reduce, if not eliminate, such
conflicts.

Historically, the more serious [[conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} arose
[between]{.underline} state and local [agencies]{.underline} and their
federal counterparts. [[There]{.mark} appears to [have been
a]{.mark}]{.underline} corresponding
**[[reduction]{.underline}]{.mark}** in these conflicts as well, [a
phenomenon many [attribute to]{.mark} a **spirit of [greater
coop]{.mark}eration** brought on by the 9/11 attacks]{.underline}.

That leaves the [federal agencies]{.underline}, which [have certainly
not]{.underline} \[\*192\] [been immune to **turf wars**]{.underline}.
And according to recent reports, turf battles continue to be a problem
for federal law enforcement agencies, despite their use of task forces
and other, similar efforts. One reason why such conflicts persist among
federal agencies is that, unlike their state and local counterparts,
federal agencies\' [jurisdictional **authority** is]{.underline}
predicated not on geographical turf, but on what a recent report refers
to as **[\"operational turf.\"]{.underline}**

In situations like the hypothetical noted earlier, in which a crime
scene falls within the State Police\'s and the local Sheriff\'s
geographical turf, the State Police may defer to the Sheriff, because
his office has stronger ties to that location and the victim. That
calculus does not come into play at the federal level because, as I
noted earlier, the federal law enforcement agencies listed above all
have national jurisdiction. This, as noted above, means their turf is
not linked to a specific state, county, city, or other area. The agents
employed by these agencies operate out of specific, geographically
located offices, but this is a matter of operational efficiency and, as
such, does not define the legitimate scope of an agency\'s operations.
That is a function of \"operational turf,\" that is, of the statutes
that define a given agency\'s investigative authority.

If these statutes parsed investigative authority out among the five
agencies listed above in a fashion analogous to how \[\*193\] combat
jurisdiction is parsed out among the five military branches, this would
go a long way toward reducing the [turf wars]{.underline} that currently
[**plague** federal **law enforcement**]{.underline}. Unfortunately, the
statutes rarely do this, which means agencies often have
**[[overlapping]{.underline}]{.mark}** investigative
**[[jurisdiction]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which [\"can [**open the
doors**\" to **turf battles**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a 2011
investigation of jurisdictional overlap among federal agencies, many
[agents]{.underline} reported that they had [encountered **uncertainty**
and **[disagreements]{.mark}** about the appropriate allocation
of]{.underline} investigative [authority]{.underline} and said these
[disagreements]{.underline} often [[negatively
**affect**]{.underline}]{.mark}ed [[investigations]{.mark}. Criminals\'
increasing [use of **cyberspace** is]{.mark} only [exacerbating]{.mark}
the [difficulties]{.mark} federal agents already face]{.underline}.

While turf wars and overlapping or **[[uncertain]{.underline}]{.mark}**
investigative **[[jurisdiction]{.underline}]{.mark}** continue to
[[impede]{.mark} U.S. law enforcement\'s **[ability to respond]{.mark}**
to crimes]{.underline}, they are not the only factors that are eroding
its ability to respond to cyber-threats. The problem law enforcement
must confront is the civilian correlate of the problem General Alexander
faces: we can no longer assume that attacks which appear to constitute
\"mere\" cybercrime are just that, i.e., are carried out by civilians
who are \"in\" the United States and whose motives are purely personal.
[[An attack on a **financial institution** might be]{.mark} a cybercrime
[committed]{.mark} by a greedy **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [citizen]{.underline} \"in\" the United States,
but it might, instead, be (i) a cybercrime committed by a non-United
States citizen operating from abroad or (ii) a cyber-sortie carried out
by a hostile nation-state\'s own cyber command.

III\. The Emergence of Cyber Crime

[In]{.underline} his [2013]{.underline} State of the Union address,
President Barack [Obama stated, on]{.underline} the topic of [cyber
security, that \"we cannot look back years from now and wonder why we
did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our
economy.\"]{.underline} It is now estimated that [cyber crime solicits
\$ 110 billion globally every year.]{.underline} The Federal Bureau of
Investigation recognizes three categories of cyber threats: organized
crime groups, state sponsors, and terrorist \[\*280\] groups. It is
organized crime groups and terrorist organizations that are susceptible
to RICO violations.

[[International organized]{.mark} criminal [syndicates use the Internet
in **furtherance** of]{.mark} more traditional **[real world
activities]{.mark}** like drug distribution and sex trafficking.
However, [they]{.mark} have also **[take]{.mark}**n [advantage
of]{.mark} the [digital]{.mark} world [to find]{.mark} new [**outlets**
for]{.mark} criminal activity including **mass [fraud]{.mark}** schemes,
**identity theft**, **online [banking crimes]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark}
**money [laundering]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Also,
[[groups]{.underline}]{.mark} composed of specialized criminals [have
[**evolved** to commit **all**]{.mark} of their [crimes
online]{.mark}]{.underline}. These groups differ from traditional
organized criminals because [they gain illicit profits **purely** via
computer]{.underline} and maintain no clearly defined structural
hierarchy. Nevertheless, their loose association in continual criminal
schemes fit the definition of an \"enterprise\" as defined in RICO.

These [specialized organized cyber crime groups employ new tools to
commit their acts. The [emergence of botnets]{.mark}, a network of
infected computers, [is **essential** to]{.mark} the
**[profitability]{.mark}** of the group]{.underline}. The botnet allows
for an attack on thousands of private users or corporate networks
instead of criminally infiltrating the systems on an individual basis.
Similarly, \"mules\" are essential to the vitality \[\*281\] of the
criminal enterprise. A \"mule\" is recruited for the sole purpose of
receiving the illicit funds, often via bank account, and turning these
funds into cash. Generally, mules receive small portions in monetary
value and are scattered across the globe so as not to endanger the
entire scheme if one is apprehended by law enforcement.

Public-Private Partnerships to Combat Illicit Trade and Illegal Economy\
[[The illegal economy poses an **existential threat**
when]{.underline}]{.mark} it begins to create [**criminalized

[[launch]{.underline}]{.mark}es [[a downward]{.underline}]{.mark},

state-building become less attainable, economic growth is stunted,
[efforts toward **[development]{.mark}** and poverty eradication [are
**stifled**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and foreign direct investment is

The United States is supporting the OECD, the World Economic Forum
(WEF), and other international partners to provide knowledge-based
platforms for international public and private stakeholders to raise
awareness of the threat posed by illicit trade and illegal economy to
economic growth, development, and global security, and to share
experience on practical approaches to the control of illicit activities
as well as of the negative externalities of the illicit economy.
Engaging the public and private sectors through innovative
public-private partner-ships will be particularly important for securing
the integrity of the global supply chains and for ensuring long-term
sustainable licit commerce and productive markets.

The steep rise in mobility of goods, people, capital, and information
that has accompanied globalization is largely comprised of lawful and
beneficial exchanges, but an increasing share is illicit.
[**[Criminal]{.mark} entrepreneurs** and **illicit
[networks]{.mark}**]{.underline} sometimes use or exploit legitimate
businesses and legitimate global supply chains to carry out financial
frauds, industrial espio-nage, money laundering, and other illicit
activities. [Hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue from these

#### They [dropped]{.underline} that it wrecks [development]{.underline}\-\--extinction

4.3. Linking risks with progress in the SDGs

Generally it is the Outcome/Foundational and Human input SDGs that are
most directly related. For example [as the movement of [**refugees**
**increase**]{.mark}s **[pandemic risk]{.mark}**, poverty
levels]{.underline} in low and middle income countries [increase
reducing]{.underline} the [health]{.underline} of the population, [and
so restricting]{.underline} access to [education which]{.underline}
further [enhances poverty and birth rates rise]{.underline} as family
sizes increases [generating unsustainable **[pop]{.mark}**ulation
**[growth]{.mark}** which [furthers]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[migration]{.mark} of refugees]{.underline} (Fig. 5). Fig. 3 shows that
leverage points to reduce refugees lies in SDG 16 (Peace Justice and
Strong Institutions), [reducing malnutrition]{.underline} through
alleviating SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and taking SDG 13 (Climate Action) to
[avoid]{.underline} the [mass movement]{.underline} of people to avoid
the impacts of global warming.

height="1.9258213035870517in"}

Global warming itself will drive disruptive changes in both terrestial
and aquatic ecosystems affecting SDG 15 (Life on Land) and SDG 14 (Life
Below Water) adding to their vulnerability to increases in pollution
driven by a growing economy. Loop B (in Fig. 4)shows the constraints
associated with SDG 13 (Climate Action) may slow the economic investment
in industry and infrastructure reducing the pollution generated,
encouraging adoption of SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) whilst
stimulating carbon reduction and measures such as afforestation, which
will also improve the foundational environmental goals.

[**Depletion of resources** and **biodiversity** are **strongly linked**
to SDG]{.underline} 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production)
[through]{.underline} measures such as [halving global waste,
reducing]{.underline} waste [generation through recycling]{.underline}
reuse and reduction schemes, [and striving for]{.underline} more
[efficient industrial processes]{.underline}. The more resources that
are used, the less responsible is Consumption and Production which may
thus reduce biodiversity (Fig. 3) and increase the amounts of wastes
accumulating in the environment.

[The final driver of Global Catastrophic Risk is an
**[ag]{.mark}**ricultural **[shortfall]{.mark}** which will [increase
**global Hunger**]{.mark}]{.underline} (SDG 2) [and widen]{.underline}
the [Inequality]{.underline} (SDG 10) between rich and poor nations and
individuals. [Quality [Education]{.mark}]{.underline} (SDG 4) [is
important as a **[key]{.mark} leverage point** [to]{.mark} stimulate the
generation and adoption of new **[tech]{.mark}**nologies [to improve
**energy**]{.mark}]{.underline} (SDG 7) [[and **water**]{.mark}
supplies]{.underline} (6) [which can enhance **agricultural
production**.]{.underline} Such linkages are convincingly examined and
demonstrated in the recent film "The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind" (2019),
based on a factual story of water shortages in Malawi in the mid 2000s.

These examples may appear self evident, but it is the connections
between the goals and how they adjust together that is important to
consider so the consequence of policy actions in one area can be fully
understood. [[Because of]{.mark} the **[underlying]{.mark} system
[structures]{.mark}** global [threats]{.mark} can **[quickly
transmit]{.mark}** through the system]{.underline}. Water Crises will
limit the water available for agriculture and basic needs which in turn
will stimulate a decline in Gender Equality (SDG 5). Technology
disruption from cyber attacks will restrict the ability to operate
Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11) and potentially expose
populations to extreme events by disrupting transport, health services,
and the ability to pay for adaptation and mitigation of climate related
threats from a weakened economy. [**[Conflict]{.mark}** (in all forms)
will **[increase]{.mark}**]{.underline} refugees and climate change
provides the backdrop against which all these interactions will play
out.

Whilst it is possible that general catastrophic risk or [**[existential
risk]{.mark} scenarios** may [eventuate]{.mark} from the non-achievement
of the **S**]{.underline}ustainable **[D]{.underline}**evelopment
**[G]{.underline}**oals, there are certain aspects within the causal
loop diagram which if prioritised will reduce this risk. For example, to
reduce the risk of pandemic, ensuring that the number of Refugees is
minimised, and is a leverage point. Similarly, prioritising SDG 3 (Good
Health and Well-being) is essential and is enabled by many of the other
goals. However, a feature missing from the SDGs is a recognition of the
precautionary principle, with an implicit assumption that technological
innovation alone may create improvements in many of the goals.

#### It destabilizes [every region]{.underline}\-\--nuclear war

**Dobriansky '1** \[Paula, Under Secretary for Global Affairs at the
State Department, "The Explosive Growth of Globalized Crime,"
<http://www.iwar.org.uk/ecoespionage/resources/transnational-crime/gj01.htm>\]

Certain types of [[**international crime** \-- terrorism]{.mark}, human
[trafficking]{.mark}, drug trafficking, [and]{.mark} contraband
[smuggling \-- involve **serious violence**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
physical harm. Other forms \-- fraud, extortion, money laundering,
bribery, economic espionage, intellectual property theft, and
counterfeiting \-- don\'t require guns to cause major damage. Moreover,
the spread of information technology has created new categories of
cybercrime. For the United States, international crime poses threats on
three broad, interrelated fronts. First, the impact is felt directly on
the streets of American communities. Hundreds of thousands of
individuals enter the U.S. illegally each year, and smuggling of drugs,
firearms, stolen cars, child pornography, and other contraband occurs on
a wide scale across our borders. Second, the expansion of American
business worldwide has opened new opportunities for foreign-based
criminals. When an American enterprise abroad is victimized, the
consequences may include the loss of profits, productivity, and jobs for
Americans at home. Third, international [**[criminal]{.mark}**s engage
in a variety of [activities]{.mark} that [pose a **grave
threat**]{.mark} to the national security of the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and the **[stability]{.mark}** and values [of
the]{.mark} entire [world]{.mark} community. Examples include the
[acquisition of **w**]{.mark}**eapons of [m]{.mark}ass
[d]{.mark}estruction**, trade in banned or dangerous substances, [and
trafficking]{.mark} in women and children. [Corruption]{.mark} and the
enormous flow of unregulated, crime-generated profits [are **serious
threats** to]{.mark} the stability of [**democratic institutions**

world]{.underline}.

[I am often asked what keeps me awake at night]{.underline} after nearly

frightening issues]{.underline}]{.mark}: Iran, North Korea, the
insurgency in Afghanistan, civil war in Syria , cyberthreats , chemical
weapons, terrorism. [[But]{.mark} my one-word answer may surprise:
convergence. [Convergence]{.mark}]{.underline} may be thought of as the
dark side of globalization. It [is [the]{.mark} [merger of]{.mark} a
wide variety of mobile human [activities]{.mark}, each of which is
individually dangerous and whose sum [represents a far greater
threat.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The most obvious]{.underline}]{.mark}
example of this kind of convergence [is
[narco-terrorism.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Drug cartels use sophisticated
trafficking]{.mark} routes [to move huge amounts]{.mark} of heroin,
cocaine and methamphetamines. [Terrorists can]{.mark} in
effect]{.underline} "[[rent]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[these]{.mark}
routes]{.underline} by co-opting the drug cartels through money,
coercion or ideological persuasion. [These organizations can [then
move]{.mark} personnel, cash or arms]{.underline} --- **[possibly even a

**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**estruction--- [[clandestinely to the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates. Other
globally trafficked illicit goods can also be found constantly moving on
these routes: stolen and counterfeit intellectual property, illegal
migrants, human slaves, laundered cash, sophisticated armaments.
[Meanwhile, [in]{.mark} [laboratories in]{.mark} North [Korea, Iran and
Syria,]{.mark} **sophisticated [w]{.mark}e**]{.underline}apons of

global trafficking routes]{.mark} and w]{.underline}eapons of

be catastrophic.]{.mark}**]{.underline} A [[special]{.underline}]{.mark}
case of this kind of **[[convergence is emerging in the
cyberworld]{.underline}]{.mark}**, where the greatest mismatch between
the level of threat to our country (high) and our level of preparation
(low) is evident. High-threat packages move through the world's servers,
fiber-optic cables and routers in the service of nations, anarchic
organizations and garden-variety hackers. [[Trillions of dollars' worth
of cybercrime occurs each year]{.underline}]{.mark}; if the
cyber-capability and the resultant cash converge with terrorist groups
or pariah states such as Iran and North Korea, the potential for
catastrophe is high. So, what can be done? First and foremost, the
United States and the international community must recognize the threat
this kind of deviant globalization poses. [[Convergence of]{.mark} these
mobile [illicit activities]{.mark} can [rapidly undermine global
security norms]{.mark}. [Too often the focus is on single-point
threats]{.mark} --- [drugs]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[money laundering,
human trafficking]{.underline}]{.mark}, weapons trading, production of
weapons of mass destruction --- [while **[the true threat lies in their
convergence]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The Obama administration's Strategy

GEN DEMPSEY: I\'m very concerned about that. In fact, I have raised it
[\[is\] as all the [more reason]{.mark} for us [to come together]{.mark}

### Uniqueness\-\--2NC

#### Biden's providing the NSA with authority

**Dark Reading '22** \[Dark Reading; Jan 20; long one of the most widely
read cybersecurity news sites, Dark Reading is also the most trusted
online community for security professionals; Dark Reading "Biden
Broadens NSA Oversight of National Security Systems,"
https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/biden-broadens-nsa-oversight-of-national-security-systems\]

President [Biden]{.underline} yesterday [signed a memorandum that
effectively **expands** the **N**]{.underline}ational
**[S]{.underline}**ecurity **[A]{.underline}**gency\'s [role in
overseeing the **cybersecurity**]{.underline} [of intelligence,
**military**, and other US government networks that handle
**classified** or **sensitive** military or **intel activities and
data**]{.underline}.

[\"We stand ready to fulfill our role, and our responsibility, in
securing our nation against foreign malicious actors, and any efforts to
exploit our national security systems]{.underline},\" said General Paul
M. Nakasone, chief of the NSA and director of the US Commander Cyber
Command, in a statement about the NSA\'s enhanced role.

Agencies with national security systems now report to Nakasone any cyber
incidents of their systems, how they are mitigating cybersecurity
incidents, and assessments of threats to their systems. The memorandum
also requires them to adopt more modern encryption and zero-trust
security strategies, among other cybersecurity practices.

\"[The new authorities will provide us with the necessary cybersecurity
visibility]{.underline} into our most important systems,\" said Rob
Joyce, NSA cybersecurity director and deputy national manager for
national security systems. \"This new insight will allow us to identify
vulnerabilities, detect malicious threat activity and drive mitigations
to better secure all national security systems.\"

#### NSA SIGINT authority enables them to be the globe's most effective cybersecurity agent 

**Economist '20** \["A new global ranking of cyber-power throws up some
surprises," The Economist, September 19, 2020,
https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2020/09/19/a-new-global-ranking-of-cyber-power-throws-up-some-surprises\]

America rules digital national security, China is not far behind

China has the world's largest army. Russia wields the most tanks.
America owns the fanciest satellites. But **[who has the most
cyber-power]{.underline}**? A new National Cyber Power Index by the
Belfer Centre at Harvard University ranks 30 countries on their level of
ambition and capability. **[Offensive cyber-power]{.underline}**---the
ability to do harm in or through computer networks---is one measure. But
so too are the strength of a country's defences, the sophistication of
its cyber-security industry and its ability to spread and counter
propaganda (see chart).

That **[America stands at the top of the list]{.underline}** is not
surprising. **[Its]{.underline}** cyber-security budget for fiscal year
2020 stood at over \$17bn and the **[National Security
Agency]{.underline}** (nsa), its **[signals-intelligence]{.underline}**
(sigint) **[agency]{.underline}**, probably gets well over \$10bn. The
[awesome scale of]{.underline} America's [digital espionage]{.underline}
was laid bare in leaks by Edward Snowden, a former nsa contractor, in
2013, which showed the agency hoovering up vast amounts of the world's
internet traffic and trying to weaken encryption standards.

China, in second place, has demonstrated a voracious appetite for
commercial cyber-espionage abroad and an iron grip on the internet at
home. Britain, whose National Cyber Security Centre has parried over
1,800 cyber-attacks since its creation in 2016, is third. Britain is
currently setting up an offensive National Cyber Force staffed jointly
by spies and soldiers. Russia, whose spies interfered with America's
last election, is in fourth place.

The big surprise is the Netherlands in fifth place, ahead of France,
Germany and Canada. Dutch expertise in analysing malware is particularly
sharp, says a Dutch insider, who points out that this is handy both for
spotting attacks and mounting them. The cybercrime team of the Dutch
police has proved adept at apprehending online criminals. And in 2014
the small but world-class group of hackers working for Dutch
intelligence managed to penetrate a computer network used by the svr,
Russia's foreign intelligence service---including cctv cameras in the
building---allowing them to watch as the Russians hacked America's State
Department.

[Measuring cyber-power is fraught with difficulty]{.underline}, warns
Marcus Willett, a former deputy director of gchq, Britain's sigint
agency. Many experts are puzzled by Israel's relatively low ranking on
the Belfer index, despite its hacking prowess; its secrecy may be one
reason for this. "Warships in the Antarctic can easily be seen," says Mr
Willett, "yet a piece of code inserted into a power plant is hard to
detect." Though **[some states acknowledge their offensive
capabilities---America and Britain boast of smashing Islamic State
networks]{.underline}** in Iraq and Syria, partly as a signal to Russia
and China---most shy away from doing so.

Many countries outsource the dirtiest work to deniable proxies, like
"hacktivists" and criminals. And whereas procuring a warship or missile
is expensive and time-consuming, potent malware can be stolen or bought
online. WannaCry, a ransomware attack mounted by North Korea in 2017,
used a hacking tool, **[EternalBlue, which had leaked out of the
nsa]{.underline}**.

#### The plan disrupts domestic and global intel collection\-\--the military is a [cyber neophyte]{.underline}, which ensures backlash

Second, it is not just about cyber effect operations taking place in
systems or networks in allied territory. [[There could also be a
**negative impact on allied intel**]{.underline}]{.mark}ligence
operations and capabilities beyond these systems and networks. [The U.S
Cyber Command]{.underline} -- and other [[military cyber
organizations]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [**[are operating in a global
environment]{.mark}** historically **[dominated by intelligence
agencies]{.mark}**,]{.underline} and the Five Eyes has always been the
most dominant actor in cyberspace.39 But [the Anglophone intelligence
alliance is not the only intelligence actor operating across the
world.]{.underline} Recent cases -- such as the infiltration of the
Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service into the Russia-based
network of the infamous hacking group Cozy Bear -- [have illustrated the
continued global prevalence and value of allies' intelligence operations
beyond the Five Eyes alliance.]{.underline}40 [[If U.S. Cyber Command
increasingly take up the role of '**disrupter**']{.underline} **[it may
negatively impact global intel]{.underline}**]{.mark}ligence
**[[collection]{.underline}]{.mark}** of allies -- [[particularly those
countries that favor long-term access over]{.mark} [immediate effect**.
It will also more likely uncover and burn allied
capabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The risks of occurring are higher than one may think as **[[intelligence
agencies have a tendency and incentive to target and track the same
entities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example, in late 2014,
cybersecurity company [Kaspersky]{.underline} Lab reported on the
so-called 'Magnet of Threats'. The cybersecurity company [discovered a
server belonging to a research org]{.underline}anization [in the Middle
East that]{.underline} simultaneously [hosted implants for]{.underline}
at least [five]{.underline} Advanced Persistent Threat
([APT]{.underline}) actors: Regin and the Equation Group, Turla and
ItaDuke, Animal Farm, and Careto.41 All of these [APTs]{.underline} have
been [associated with prominent national security and
intel]{.underline}ligence agencies. Equation group and Regin are
connected to the Five-Eyes. As said, Animal Farm has been attributed to
France's external intelligence agency. Turla Group has been associated
with the Russian federal security service (FSB). ItaDuke is said to be
linked to the Russian government too. Finally, it is theorized that
Spain is behind Careto, also known as 'The Mask'.

Consider what would have happened if one of those five APT groups had
sought to cause a disruptive effect -- rather than collect intelligence
-- against the target in the Middle East. It likely would have resulted
in much earlier discovery and analysis by threat intelligence companies
(or other actors) exposing the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs)
of each actor group.

#### Expanding security cooperation for cybersecurity is exclusively Title 10\-\--that leaves the NSA behind 

**Thaler et al. '16** \[David E., Michael J. McNerney, Beth Grill,
Jefferson P. Marquis, Amanda Kadlec; 2016; Senior International/Defense
Researcher at the RAND Institute, M.I.A. in International Security
Policy from Columbia; Acting Director, International Security and
Defense Policy Center; Senior International/Defense Researcher and

Patchwork to Framework: A Review of Title 10 Authorities for Security
Cooperation,"
<https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1400/RR1438/RAND_RR1438.pdf>\]

We refer to lack of flexibility in authorities in a previous section;
this has led to \"gaming\" behavior---even embarrassment in
relationships--- as SC personnel need to stretch the intent of the
authorities to fill perceived gaps in their ability to achieve SC
objectives. In one case, discussants spoke of two seminars held recently
in Poland and Estonia to share ideas and best practices and gain
\"intellectual interoperability\" with allies with regard to Russian
activities. These seminars took months of preparation and required
considerable funding by the host nations, but at the last minute there
was a cost increase because U.S. statute did not allow DoD to fund the
coffee because the forums were not CT-related. **[Emerging
threats]{.underline}** (e.g., **[to cyber operations]{.underline}** or
maritime security) **[create some of these gaps]{.underline}**, but
there are also gaps that emerge from other needs, such as the need to
sustain equipment that has been provided to partners through Title 10
authorities.

**[[In the case of cyber]{.mark}security]{.underline}**, some [CCMDs are
getting requests from partners to help them improve their capabilities
but note that they \"can\'t do it.\"]{.underline} [While the belief may
not yet be widespread that [a relative]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**lack of
authorities** for cyber security is a problem]{.mark}, there is growing
recognition of the **importance** of this **domain**]{.underline} [and
that **[partners\' weakness in cyber security]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[is also **U.S. weakness**]{.mark} given that U.S.]{.underline}
[strategy depends on the support and competence of those
partners]{.underline}. Some [DoD stakeholders with whom we]{.underline}
[engaged indicated that [they found **no reasonable authority** for
**building cyber capacity**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and thus could not
conduct exchanges]{.mark} or training [with]{.mark} a range of
[partners]{.mark} in this area, especially in the case of countries that
cannot afford to send their personnel to relevant schools]{.underline}.
There have been attempts to apply Section 1206 to cyber BPC activities,
but this is one of those \"gaming\" situations mentioned above and is
suboptimal. Stakeholders note that **[cyber should be more integrated
into engagements with partners]{.underline}**, [and that they would like
broader authority to work with them.]{.underline} They point out that
the **[[SC]{.underline}]{.mark}** community **[[can be slow to respond
to a]{.mark} [dynamic]{.mark}]{.underline}** and changing **[[security
environment]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and that [greater focus on
**building cyber capacity is warranted**]{.underline}. This appears to
be a critical need, as U.S.

forces overseas \"rely on our partners for critical infrastructure \[in
their countries\]: energy, power, telecommunications, and water.\"

#### That undermines the "dual-hatting" unified command structure crucial to NSA effectiveness 

**Alexander '13** \[Keith; June 12; COMMANDER, UNITED STATES CYBER
COMMAND DIRECTOR, NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY CHIEF, CENTRAL SECURITY
SERVICE (Keith, "CYBERSECURITY: PREPARING FOR AND RESPONDING TO THE
ENDURING THREAT" Congressional Testimony,
<http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2013/0713_cyberdomain/docs/Alexander,_General_Keith_Testimony_6.12.13_Cybersecurity_Hearing.pdf>\]

Due to the intersecting responsibilities of the two organizations,
USCYBERCOM was placed at the headquarters of NSA/CSS at Fort Meade.
NSA/CSS collects signals intelligence on our cyber adversaries; and
provides information assurance strategies and technologies to protect
our national security systems. The conduct of these two missions is
critical to enabling cyber operations. NSA/CSS also has multiple,
technical capabilities critical to the cyber mission area, such as
high-performance computing and large-scale, distributed processing and
data storage. These are just some of the components of what we call the
cryptologic platform; it constitutes the collection of signals
intelligence and communications security capabilities that since 1952
have served users ranging from national customers, to departmental
analysts, to battlefield commanders. [The [defense of U.S. military
networks depends on knowing what those who would harm us are doing in
cyberspace]{.mark}, which in turn depends on intelligence produced by
NSA]{.underline} and other members of the Intelligence Community
regarding adversary intentions and capabilities.

[[Cyberspace is characterized by high levels of convergence]{.mark} of
separate and different networks and technology that have come together
to form something greater than the sum of the parts]{.underline}. In
this regard, [USCYBERCOM's co-location with NSA/CSS mirrors the
convergence in cyberspace and is a direct result of that technological
shift]{.underline}. What we have learned is that [if convergence is the
reality of the cyber environment, then integration must be the reality
of our response. Co-location promotes intense and mutually beneficial
collaboration in an operational environment in which USCYBERCOM's
success relies on net-speed intelligenc]{.underline}e. Although they are
separate and distinct organizations with their own missions and
authorities, **[[NSA/CSS is a major force multiplier for
USCYBERCOM]{.underline}]{.mark}**, pairing the Command's operators,
planners, and analysts with the expertise and assistance of NSA/CSS'
cryptographers, analysts, access developers, on-net operators, language
analysts, and support personnel. These are close working relationships
that enable seamless, deconflicted operations that are vital to the
success of the cyber mission. [[Co-location also improves the
deconfliction of]{.mark} [operations]{.mark}; physical proximity
enhances mutual understanding and awareness of mission areas and helps
forge effective partnerships that serve both organizations and the
nation well. Only a tightly integrated team, and tightly integrated
solutions, can do what is required to address cyber threats at net
speed]{.underline}.

I serve as the dual-hatted Commander, USCYBERCOM, and Director,
NSA/Chief, CSS. The [[dual-hatting unifies the capabilities for
full-spectrum cyber operations]{.mark} under a single official,
[maximizes the leverage of NSA/CSS cyber capabilities]{.mark},
capacities, and authorities, [and establishes unity of effort in
cyberspace]{.mark} for the Department of Defense. It [allows
deconfliction of the use of the cryptologic platform to occur]{.mark}
with full knowledge of the needs of both organizations on a timely
basis]{.underline}. Together, the people under my command and direction
at USCYBERCOM and NSA/CSS work in concert but always under their
respective authorities[[. They direct the operation of the Department's
information networks]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[detect threats in foreign
cyberspace]{.underline}]{.mark}, attribute threats, secure national
security information systems, and help ensure freedom of action for the
United States military and its allies in cyberspace---and, when
directed, defend the nation against a cyber attack.

#### The NSA conducts most info sharing with foreign partners\-\--expanding that process ensures further relegation of the NSA and sparks turf wars

**West '21** \[Laura; 2021; Major, Judge Advocate, U.S. Army, Deputy
Chief of National Security Law, U.S. Cyber Command, Fort Meade,
Maryland, LL.M and J.D.; Military Law Review, "The Rise of the "Fifth
Fight" in Cyberspace: A New Legal Framework and Implications for Great
Power Competition," Volume 229 Issue 3\]

To that end, [Congress should consider **improving** the military's
ability to share cyberspace capabilities, information, and related data
with international partners]{.underline}. **[[Intelligence agencies,
such as the NSA]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, [[have special authorities that allow
for more]{.underline}]{.mark} [[permissive]{.underline}]{.mark}
capability or [[information sharing]{.underline}]{.mark} and support
[[with foreign partners]{.underline}]{.mark}. \[341\] [[But no such
authority exists]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[outside]{.underline}]{.mark}
perhaps [[the]{.mark} long, [arduous]{.mark}, and unclear [process of
arms control and **foreign military sales**--- for the
military]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e., U.S. Cyber Command and subordinate
units), the entity now primarily conducting operations with foreign
partners in cyberspace. If one legal framework has changed to account
for the speed and changing nature of cyberspace, then others should
follow suit. Otherwise, the United States stands to lose the benefits of
those newly granted military authorities.

#### The plan requires [micromanaging]{.underline} civilian regulations that [shred]{.underline} the effectiveness of CYBERCOM

**Zehtab '18** \[Sean; June 13; JD from the University of Nebraska
College Of Law, BS from University Of Nebraska-Lincoln, Judge Advocate
in the United States Army; Harvard National Security Journal,
"Overseeing or Interfering? A Functional Alternative to Congressional
Oversight in Intelligence and Operations,"
https://harvardnsj.org/2018/06/overseeing-or-interfering-a-functional-alternative-to-congressional-oversight-in-intelligence-and-operations\]

[Recently, the Army has incorporated [cyber]{.mark}]{.underline} and
electromagnetic [capabilities]{.underline} at the Brigade level.\[6\]
Moreover, there is interest in empowering conventional commands to
deploy capabilities such as special forces and cyber in tactical
operations.\[7\] Finally, gathering open source intelligence has become
both easier and more useful at the operational level.\[8\] [All these
developments]{.underline} in Multi-Domain Operations [[raise **oversight
concerns**]{.underline}]{.mark}, since conventional units do not
currently have the kind of oversight systems designed to ensure respect
for the civil liberties of U.S. Persons,\[9\] and congress and
high-level actors are too far removed from day-to-day tactical
operations to provide effective oversight.

Oversight of military decision making is vital to preserving the
civilian control of the military, safeguarding democratic
accountability, and ensuring compliance with international law.
[**[Excessive]{.mark}** or **poorly structured** [oversight,
however]{.mark}, can **[inhibit flexible]{.mark} and timely
[responses]{.mark}** to national security threats [and]{.mark} can
**needlessly [interfere]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} the **[effective]{.mark}
use of [expertise]{.mark}** [by **military
professionals**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Good oversight, then, is a
structural balance that both ensures compliance and accountability and
permits flexibility and the effective use of expertise by military
professionals.\[10\] Achieving this balance has been an ongoing
challenge, subject to extensive scholarly debate and practical evolution
over the past decade.\[11\]

Unfortunately, the current [[oversight]{.underline}]{.mark} regime
[in]{.underline} tactical [cyber]{.underline} and other clandestine
[operations]{.underline} is in many ways the worst of both worlds: it
[**[chills]{.mark}** aggressive [action]{.mark}]{.underline} and is not
effective at ensuring respect for civil liberties. Over the past decade,
oversight has tended towards being [concentrated in]{.underline} various
[high-level [entities]{.mark}]{.underline} and individuals,
[increasingly **[far-removed]{.mark}** from the realities and
necessities of the modern operational environment]{.underline}.
Moreover, [**[Congress]{.mark}** has]{.underline} directly
[**[involve]{.mark}**d itself in military oversight]{.underline}, while
important operational decisions are made by field commanders who lack
the resources, expertise, and priorities to ensure the protection of the
civil liberties of U.S. Persons. [The [result is]{.mark}]{.underline},
predictably, violations---scarcely deterred by [a **highly
[bureaucratic]{.mark}**, **far-removed**, and **[overly
politicized]{.mark}** system of [oversight]{.mark}]{.underline}.

For instance, a single cyber operation could require oversight from
intelligence and intelligence-related entities and agencies,
congressional reporting and interagency concurrence, and ordinary
operational approval from the military approval authority. In addition
to ineffectively ensuring compliance with domestic and international
law, [the [**bureaucratic work** generated]{.mark} by the current
oversight regime **[takes]{.mark} valuable [time and attention
away]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} focusing on the [**planning** and
**execution**]{.mark} of a mission]{.underline}.\[12\]

This article argues that the Command Operations Review Board (CORB) of
the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) provides a model
of effective oversight that should be applied to the operational and
intelligence contexts. The CORB, independent but with military
experience, leanly staffed and closer to the action, effectively
balances ensuring compliance with the need for flexible, timely
operations, and has provided effective oversight of special operations.
This model, if applied more generally in operations and intelligence,
could mitigate the problems, measured in blood, treasure, and legal
violations, associated with the trend towards redundant and ineffective
oversight of these operations by high-level executive and legislative
organizations.

The core concern of this article is oversight mechanisms of contemporary
cyber and special operations. More traditional intelligence activities,
such as counterintelligence, signals intelligence and human
intelligence, conducted by DOD under the Secretary of Defense
authorities colloquially referred to as "Title 50," already have
multi-layered, robust statutory and agency regulation, whereas
operational activities, such as operational preparation of the
environment,\[13\] information operations, and cyber operations, do not
have the same robust oversight framework. Cyber and special operations
are often conducted in a clandestine manner, facing similar oversight
challenges as intelligence.\[14\] But while oversight is necessary, the
trend towards greater congressional involvement\[15\] reflects a
misplaced locus of oversight. It should take place at the operational,
not legislative, level.

### AT: Plan Not Title 10\-\--2NC

#### SC isn't Title 10\-\--it's either Title 22 or Title 10\-\--either way that strips NSA authority 

**Hooper '19** \[Lt. General Charles and Michael O'Hanlon; June 4;
Director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency; Senior Fellow and
Director of Research, Foreign Policy, Brookings; "How Security
Cooperation Advances U.S. Interests," Brookings Institute Foreign Policy
Studies Program event\]

Well, thank you, Mike, and thanks very much for having me. And good
morning, everybody. I am the director of the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency and it\'s the agency that does more and is known by
less people than anybody else in Washington, so I always welcome the
opportunity to tell everybody about it.

**[[The D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ecurity
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**ooperation **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**gency
[[is mandated by Congress to **execute all security
cooperation**]{.underline}]{.mark}, some on behalf of the State
Department, much on behalf of the Department of Defense, writ large and
worldwide. It is most known for being the executive agent for foreign
military sales, and that\'s what most people know about us. But we\'re
also responsible for excess defense articles. We are the executive agent
for all five Department of Defense regional centers, so the Marshall
Center in Germany; the Inouye Center, Asia-Pacific Center for Security
Studies, in Hawaii.

We\'re also responsible, and we\'ll talk a little bit about this later,
for what I call institutional capacity-building. That is the complement
to foreign military sales that ensures that our partners have the human
resources and the defense institutional development to properly utilize
the equipment we buy for them in the interest of national security.

Our headquarters is here in Crystal City, in Washington. We also work
with the Security Cooperation\'s officers worldwide. We work with the
COCOMs. And we\'re under actually, and this is unique for the United
States, we work for the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. So we
work for Mr. John Rood. And the reason I say that is in many countries,
the acquisitions and the arms sales come under the acquisitions or the
logistics directorates or work directly in some of our competitors, for
those companies, those state-owned companies. But here in the United
States security cooperation and arms sales is a policy tool and not a
tool for anything else. So that\'s basically kind of a snapshot of what
DSCA does.

MR. O\'HANLON: So, great. That\'s very helpful. And let me ask a couple
more follow-up questions just to continue to refine our understanding.

So a command like Africa Command, where you spent three years, which
does a lot of training in the field, is all of that training essentially
under your purview? Or the parts that do not involve U.S. weapons
transfers or sales, are they potentially separate and you coordinate,
but you\'re not in charge of that? Is that correct?

GENERAL HOOPER: Well, that\'s a very good question. The geographic
combatant commands still have the responsibility for executing security
cooperation in their respective commands. We work by, with, and through
those commands. The weapons sales portion of it, or the defense articles
and services portion of it, comes directly under DSCA\'s supervision.
Some of the training exercises and other things we work collaboratively
with the combatant commands. And then in some cases, for example, in
institutional capacity-building, we work together in a synergistic
fashion to effect that security cooperation.

So it\'s equal parts. Some things we\'re principally responsible for,
some things the combatant commands are responsible for, and some things
we work jointly together.

MR. O\'HANLON: And as we start to paint this picture of your
responsibilities and how you work with others, I also wanted to bring in
foreign military assistance and financing. And my understanding is that
there are parts of foreign military assistance of various types that we
give through the State Department and other types we give through DOD.
It depends a little bit on the recipient and the nature of the aid.
Could you help us understand that a little bit, too? Because I\'m sure
some of that money is what\'s being used to buy the weapons that you\'re
overseeing the transfer of.

GENERAL HOOPER: Absolutely. And that\'s also a very good question. So
let\'s start on what we call the Title 22 on the State Department side.

We are the executive agent. The **[[State]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Department [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} [[responsibility for foreign
military]{.underline}]{.mark} sales and we are, in effect, the executive
agent for the State Department in foreign military sales. Now, **[[there
are two real big components of security
cooperation.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[One is what we call Title
22]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is the State Department supervised
element for which we are the executive agent. [[The other half of it is
the Title 10 piece.]{.underline}]{.mark}

So, for example, as a result of the Fiscal Year \'17 NDAA, we had
several different authorities and a disparate group of authorities that
were all consolidated into one, the majority into one authority, 333,
Section 333, that many of you may be familiar with. And this constitutes
the Title 10 security cooperation piece.

The biggest way to distinguish between the two is our State Department
responsibilities are principally focused to a great extent on defense
articles and services, whereas our **[[Title 10]{.underline}]{.mark}**
responsibilities [[fall]{.underline}]{.mark}, in many cases, more
[[into]{.underline}]{.mark} the realm of **[[institutional
capacity-building, exercises]{.mark},]{.underline}** [and other types of
things like that.]{.underline}

MR. O\'HANLON: That\'s interesting. So you could think of it the
[[hardware]{.underline}]{.mark}, sort of the
[[weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}, the hardcore stuff,
[[that\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} through **[[State]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
The [[people]{.underline}]{.mark} side, [[the softer
side]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the software side is through
DOD.]{.underline}]{.mark}

training on threats to information security. There are no statutes that
specifically authorize

Table 4.10

Changes to Cybersecurity Authorities

Authority and Purpose Suggested Change (Consolidate, Revise, Clarify,
New Authority)

10 U.S.C. Sec. 1051c--- Personnel Assignments for Information Security
Education and Training • Revise to allow exchange of military personnel
and limited training and equipment to military and nonmilitary foreign
personnel

• Clarify what cyber capabilities could be shared by partner-type

the DoD to engage more broadly in information sharing and training on
cybersecurity threats.

As indicated in Chapter Two, [[cybersecurity deserves greater focus in
SC planning and implementation]{.underline}]{.mark}, and changes in
statutes can help raise the priority of this emerging mission and give
expression to congressional intent. It may be advisable
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} revise and substantially [[broaden the current
statute to enable DoD to engage in more]{.underline}]{.mark}
comprehensive [[cybersecurity activities with
partners]{.underline}]{.mark}. The authority to assign personnel to DoD
in Section 1051c could be expanded to allow for the exchange of defense
personnel with foreign countries (similar to Public Law 104-201, Section
1082, and Public Law 111-84, Section 1207). This [[would allow DoD
personnel to engage with a greater number of foreign personnel and gain
a better understanding of partners\' information security
needs]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such exchanges would likely be restricted to
certain countries with limits on the types of information that could be
shared. Section 1051c also might be broadened beyond the authority to
provide information security education and to include limited training
and equipment for both military and nonmilitary foreign agencies.
[[Such]{.underline}]{.mark} an authority [[would require Congress to
clarify what specific cyber capabilities could be
shared]{.underline}]{.mark} [[by partner-type]{.underline}]{.mark}. It
also would require close monitoring and further revision as the
cybersecurity mission area continues to evolve.

#### Organized crime has [gone digital]{.underline}\-\--robust [U.S. enforcement]{.underline} is key

Crime -- Eastern Hemisphere, FBI, "Organized Crime Has Gone High Tech",

[[As the world]{.mark} has [become]{.mark} increasingly wired, and now
[wireless]{.mark}, it is only natural that transnational [organized
crime]{.mark} (TOC) has [moved]{.mark} into the [digital]{.mark} age.
The use of sophisticated information systems is no longer solely the
realm of the hacker and the coder, it is now also the realm of the drug
dealer, the extortionist, and the illegal gambler. Currency is no longer
sponsored solely by governments, but exists in a digital
realm]{.underline}. The Internet of Things is a reality. Computer skills
are in high demand, and those skills can be developed independently and
online.

[The Internet provides a sense of anonymity to users. Anonymity, in
turn, breeds vice. Vice inevitably lures [organized crime]{.mark}, which
is only too happy to [**capitalize** on it]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
article will look at how organized criminals are utilizing technology,
what that means for law enforcement, and suggest ways TOC
[[investigators need to be positioned for **success**]{.mark} in this
new era]{.underline}.

On February 9, 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump issued Presidential
Executive Order 13773 on Enforcing Federal Law with Respect to
Transnational Criminal Organizations and Preventing International
Trafficking (E.O. 13773). That order reaffirms the commitment of the
U.S. government to address the scourge of TOC and protect communities
and individuals from its influence. That order specifically calls for
the investigation of

> criminal gangs, cartels, racketeering organizations, and other groups
> engaged in [illicit [activities]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[present a
> threat]{.underline}]{.mark} to public safety and national security and
> that are [[related to]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example: (i) the
> illegal smuggling and trafficking of humans, drugs or other
> substances, wildlife, and weapons; (ii) corruption, [cybercrime,
> fraud, [financial crimes]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
> intellectual-property theft; or the illegal concealment or transfer of
> proceeds derived from such illicit activities.1

[All of those significant criminal activities have in common the fact
that they become easier to accomplish and more efficient when technology
is leveraged to facilitate them]{.underline}. A rapidly emerging
criminal threat lies in the gap between traditional criminal
investigations and core intrusion-focused cyber investigations, where
criminals are utilizing high tech tools developed by others and taking
advantage of particularly sophisticated functionality available via the
Internet. [These tools and **[tech]{.mark}**nologies [are determining
the future of]{.mark} organized crime [investigations]{.mark}. Nowhere
does this future become clearer than when one looks at how illicit items
are being trafficked on the dark web]{.underline}.

#### Cyber crime is a [key method]{.underline} to enhance their [resource base]{.underline}

Governments, law enforcement agencies, academic researchers, and the
cyber-security industry speculate that [['conventional' organized
crime]{.mark} groups [have become **increasingly involved** in
**digital** crime]{.mark}]{.underline}. The available empirical data
suggest that criminals, operating online or on the ground, are more
likely to be involved in loosely associated illicit networks rather than
formal organizations (Décary-Hétu & Dupont, 2012). In recent years,
insurgent and extremist [[groups]{.mark} have [used Internet
**tech**]{.mark}nology [as an instrument of
**theft**]{.mark}]{.underline} in order [[to **enhance their resource
base**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Imam Samudra, convicted architect of the
2002 Bali bombings, reportedly called upon his followers to commit
credit card fraud in order to finance militant activities (Sipress,
2004).

Cyber criminals may operate as loose networks, but evidence suggests
that [members are still located in **close geographic proximity** even
when their attacks are **cross-national**]{.underline}. For example,
small local networks, as well as groups centred on relatives and
friends, remain significant actors. [Cybercrime [hot spots
with]{.mark}]{.underline} potential [[links to organized]{.mark} crime
[groups ar]{.mark}e found [in]{.mark}]{.underline} countries of
[[**Eastern Europe** and]{.mark} the former Soviet Union]{.underline}
(Kshetri, 2013a; see also Jones, 2010). Hackers from
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Ukraine are regarded as skilful
innovators. For example, the cyber crime hub in the small town of
Râmnicu Vâlcea in Romania is one of a number of such hubs widely
reported in Eastern Europe (Bhattacharjee, 2011). There is also
increasing concern about cyber crime in China (China Daily, 2010; Pauli,
2012). The source and extent of malware attacks (whether of domestic or
foreign origin) and the scale of malware-botnet activity remain unclear,
but a substantial proportion of Chinese computers are compromised and it
is likely that local crime groups play a crucial role (Kshetri, 2013a;
Chang, 2012; Kshetri, 2013b; Broadhurst & Chang, 2013). A recent study
of spam and phishing sources found that these originated from a small
number of ISPs (20 of 42,201 observed), which the author dubbed
'Internet bad neighbourhoods.' One in particular, Spectranet (Nigeria),
was host to 62% of IP addresses that were spam related. Phishing hosts
were mostly located in the United States, while spam originated from
ISPs located in India, Brazil and Vietnam (Moura, 2013).

### Pharma Impact\-\--2NC

#### Cybercrime [decks]{.underline} the pharmaceutical industry

Abstract

[[**Nothing is more valuable** to]{.mark} a **[pharm]{.mark}**aceutical
company [than the formula for]{.mark} one of its [new
drugs]{.mark}]{.underline}. Reports of hackers breaking into all sorts
of firms and stealing their trade secrets is of enormous concern.
Equally troubling, experts warn that theft of trade secrets by company
insiders is a larger problem. This article looks at some recent cases of
corporate cyber-espionage and insider trade secret theft. It discusses
the use of spear phishing and zero-day exploits by sophisticated
criminal gangs targeting corporations as well as more traditional, but
hard to detect cases of outsiders paying employees to steal secrets.
Many of the victims of cyber theft find themselves the target of class
action lawsuits and regulatory actions. A quick look at data breach
shows a rapidly changing regulatory environment, growing risks of
litigation, and some important insurance implications for companies and
their top management. This article ends with some areas that companies
should consider in tightening up their safeguards against intellectual
property theft.

Introduction

In 2011, the UK government estimates its pharmaceutical, biotechnology
and healthcare sector suffered ₤1.8b in losses arising from theft of
intellectual property (IP)2. The same year, the US government reportedly
estimated its economy suffered \$500b in harm from intellectual property
and trade secret theft3. The Obama administration has publicly accused
China of orchestrating many of these attacks against US organizations
and even took the extraordinary step of indicting alleged members of the
Chinese government's elite military hacking team4.

One Chinese gang allegedly behind attacks on Boston Scientific and other
US pharmaceutical companies also developed an exploit deployed
specifically against Japanese targets5. According to FireEye, in 2013,
Japan was the fourth largest target of such sophisticated cyber gangs
that it tracks 6. If Japan's pharmaceutical industry incurred damages on
a level similar to the UK (whose market is about half the size), this
would amount to something on the scale of ¥300b per year7.

[The global market for pharmaceuticals is estimated to hit]{.underline}
USD \$[1.1 trillion this year]{.underline}8. [[Strong demand]{.mark} for
new cures [and high profits]{.mark} associated with marketing new,
patent-protected drugs [drive **fierce competition**]{.mark} in product
development]{.underline}1. It is not surprising then that [[criminal
elements]{.mark} have **[increasingly targeted]{.mark}** the
**[i]{.mark}**]{.underline}ntellectual
**[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}**roperty [of pharmaceutical companies. [The
cost]{.mark} of IP falling into a competitor's hands]{.underline},
however, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} difficult to calculate9. For its 2014
estimate of the global cost of cybercrime, CSIS presented a wide range
of \$375-**[[575m]{.underline}]{.mark}** and specifically noted the
difficulty of calculating damages caused by IP theft, adding this
difficulty likely produced an artificially low estimate10.

Despite this challenge, some hard costs are identifiable. Cyber damages
expert, the Ponemon Institute, estimates that globally the cost of
recovering from a breach averaged \$3.5m in 201411. Ponemon's 2014
review of cyber incidents reported by 26 Japanese companies in 10
sectors showed that the average cost of remediation in Japan is
approximately ¥241m12. In addition, the firm found that the adage, [["an
ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure", applies to]{.mark} a
**[robust cyber defense]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On average, Ponemon
found a strong security posture to be the single most important factor
in decreasing the cost of cleaning up after a cyber-incident2.

#### Extinction

Dr. Hugo **Engelhardt 8**, PhD, MD, Professor of Philosophy at Rice
University, "Innovation and the Pharmaceutical Industry: Critical
Reflections on the Virtues of Profit," EBrary

Many are suspicious of, or indeed jealous of, the good fortune of
others. Even when profit is gained in the market without fraud and with
the consent of all buying and selling goods and services, there is a
sense on the part of some that something is wrong if considerable profit
is secured. There is even a sense that good fortune in the market,
especially if it is very good fortune, is unfair. One might think of
such rhetorically disparaging terms as \"wind-fall profits\". There is
also a suspicion of the pursuit of profit because it is often embraced
not just because of the material benefits it sought, but because of the
hierarchical satisfaction of being more affluent than others. The
pursuit of profit in the pharmaceutical and medical-device industries is
tor many in particular morally dubious because it is acquired from those
who have the bad fortune to be diseased or disabled. Although the
suspicion of profit is not well-founded, this suspicion is a major moral
and public-policy challenge. [[Profit in]{.mark} the market for the
[pharma]{.mark}ceutical]{.underline} and medical-device [industries
[is]{.mark} to be [celebrated]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is the case, in
that if one is of the view (1) that [the presence of additional
resources for **[r]{.mark}**esearch [and **d**]{.mark}evelopment
**[spurs innovation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in the development of
pharmaceuticals]{.underline} and med-ical devices (i.e., if one is of
the view that the allure of [[profit is]{.mark} one of [the most
effective way]{.mark}s not only to acquire resources but productively
[to direct human energies]{.mark}]{.underline} in their use), (2) that
given the limits of altruism and of the willingness of persons to be
taxed, the possibility of profits is necessary to secure such resources,
(3) that the allure of [profits]{.underline} also tends to [enhance the
creative use of available resources in the pursuit of
phar-maceutical]{.underline} and medical-device
[innovation]{.underline}, and (4) if one judges it to be the case that
such **[[innovation is]{.underline}]{.mark}** both [**[necessary to
maintain the human species]{.underline}** [in a]{.underline}]{.mark}[n
ever-[changing and]{.mark} always [dangerous environment in which **new
microbial** and other threats]{.mark} may [at any time emerge to
threaten **human**]{.mark} **well-being, if not
[survival]{.mark}**]{.underline} (i.e., that such [[innovation is
necessary to prevent]{.mark} increases in morbidity and
[mortality]{.mark} risks]{.underline}), [as well as]{.underline} (5) in
order generally to [decrease morbidity]{.underline} and [mortality risks
in the]{.underline} future, it then follows (6) that [one should be
concerned regarding any policies that decrease the amount of resources
and energies available to encourage such innovation]{.underline}. One
should indeed be of the view that the possibilities for profit, all
things being equal, should be highest in the pharmaceutical and
medical-device industries. Yet, there is a suspicion regarding the
pursuit of profit in medicine and especially in the pharmaceutical and
medical-device industries.

## Dedev

### Dedev\-\--1NC

#### The aff prevents a short-term crisis that causes a transition away from growth, which is unsustainable and otherwise causes extinction 

**Kirk '18** \[Martin, co-founder and Director of Strategy for The
Rules, former Head of Campaigns at Oxfam UK and Head of Global Advocacy
for Save the Children, citing a study by Rodolfo Dirzo and Paul Ehrlich
from the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment and Gerardo
Ceballos of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, "What if
economic growth isn't as positive as you think?,"
<https://www.fastcompany.com/90202203/what-if-economic-growth-isnt-as-positive-as-you-think>\]

But there are some new strains of thought that take a more nuanced and
sophisticated view of growth. That say, yes, all other things being
equal, economic growth is a positive thing. But all other things are not
equal. There's no such thing as a free lunch, and, [for all its
positives, [economic growth]{.mark} has a **dark side**; its
**[ecological impact]{.mark}**. The impacts of our ever-growing
economy]{.underline} have become so stark and so widespread that they
[are]{.underline} by any sane measure [**portents to
[catastrophe]{.mark}**. Whether it's the fact that [**Antarctic ice**
is]{.mark} now [melting **three times**]{.mark} **faster** than we
thought, or the unfolding "**[biological annihilation]{.mark}**" that
[has]{.mark} already [wiped out **50% of all animals**]{.mark} and up to
**75% of all insects**, or the fact that]{.underline}, in spite of all
this, [[we are **pumping out CO2 at record levels**]{.mark}, it takes
willful ignorance]{.underline} or a blinding ideology [to deny the
severity of the crisis]{.underline}.

This creates a terrible paradox: [Economic growth]{.underline} keeps
economies stable today, but **[threatens]{.underline}** not just future
growth but medium-term [**social** and **civilizational cohesion**, and
ultimately the **very capacity of this biosphere to sustain
life**]{.underline}. A paper published in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences last year suggested that "**[[the window
for]{.mark} effective [action is very short]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
probably [two or three decades]{.underline} at most." And that even this
dire prediction [is]{.underline} considered
"**[conservative]{.underline}**" by the authors, "[given the
**increasing trajectories** of the drivers of extinction]{.underline}."
In terms of practical politics, [that means **acting
immediately**]{.underline}, preferably yesterday.

[Most]{.underline} politicians [deal with this]{.underline} paradox [by
**ignoring it**]{.underline}. It's by far the easiest option; one
afforded every incentive and reward by this political economy and the
beliefs that underpin it. [This belief system has been dominant for a
long time now]{.underline}. We are, as a society, deeply comfortable
with it, which means [many of its core assumptions are **considered
unassailable**]{.underline}--too obvious to question. The most profound
being this idea that growth is always good. Questioning this amounts to
political suicide for any politician.

[Or, at least, it **used to**. [We are **starting to see**]{.mark}
**some [movement]{.mark}**]{.underline} in interesting corners of the
global political landscape [[that suggest]{.mark} that some [leaders are
**showing**]{.mark} **the sort of political [courage]{.mark}** [needed
to **shift**]{.mark} **established [norms]{.mark}**. It may well be
starting to become]{.underline} something of [a **bonafide political
movement**]{.underline}. It's young and small, still, but so were all
movements at one time.

A little thought experiment shows how growth can be a problem: Insert
the word "a" before it. "A growth." That feels very different from just
"growth," right? Growth is a big part of what we all understand happens
in a healthy life. Children grow, knowledge grows, love grows. But "a
growth" is what happens when life gets corrupted. "A growth" is when the
growth is unchecked, and thus a symptom not of health but disease; when
it takes on the character of an invader, attacking its host. The word
for growth that gets out of control in this way, such that it becomes "a
growth," is, of course, cancer.

[But wait]{.underline}, I hear you cry, [**technological progress will
save us**! We can just **grow meat in test tubes** rather than needing
so much land and clean air space for cows and their methane-laden farts,
or we can all **switch to renewable energy**, or **recycle more** and
**better**]{.underline}, and then we can get back to the promise of
infinite growth. Unfortunately, [the **evidence is clear** that this is
**simply not possible**. Yes, we can **make dents** in our impact with
such measures]{.underline}, and we should with all possible speed, [but
the way the global economy is currently programmed means such things
are]{.underline} important--but also **[entirely
insufficient]{.underline}**.

So, once we discard the vain hope of being able to grow the economy
infinitely and indefinitely, what are we looking at? This is where the
innovation and bravery come in.

[A new alliance was formed in 2017, called the **Wellbeing Economy
Alliance**]{.underline}. What [they are shooting for is]{.underline}
one--or many **[different]{.underline}**--**[economic
model(s)]{.underline}** that have, "the fundamental goal of achieving
sustainable well-being with dignity and fairness for humans and the rest
of Nature." Which means they cannot just reach for socialism or any
other historical model--socialism, like capitalism, relies on growth, as
does communism. [They have recognized that we can't rely on past
thinking]{.underline}; we must genuinely put our best brains forward and
innovate.

[We're **[not]{.mark} talking about [a bunch of random]{.mark}**,
**dreamy [utopians]{.mark}** here, [but **real politicians**]{.mark} who
have won **real elections** and are exercising **real
power**]{.underline}. So far, [the roster of governments signing
up]{.underline} to the Alliance [[includes **Scotland**, **Costa Rica**,
**Slovenia**, and **New Zealand**]{.mark}. Other governments that are
actively looking at the issue include **Italy**, and there are political
parties emerging, like the **Alternative Party in Denmark**, which is
also embracing the innovation challenge. These are not]{.underline} what
are often referred to as [Tier 1 countries]{.underline} in the
international order, [but neither are they so small they are
irrelevant]{.underline}.

[Scotland]{.underline}, for example, [provides a **direct line** into
both the **U.K.** and]{.underline} (at least for the time being) [the
**EU**. Costa Rica has **long been a pioneer** of innovative economic
and social thinking, with impressive results]{.underline}: It is
routinely in the top three countries in the world when measured for the
well-being and happiness of their people. [New Zealand]{.underline} is,
perhaps, the most newly bold. Its prime minster has not only called
growth-at-all-costs capitalism "a "blatant failure" but also [has said
her government **would no longer accept GDP** as the sole, supreme
measure of progress]{.underline}. "The measures for us have to change,"
she said in October last year. "We need to make sure we are looking at
people's ability to actually have a meaningful life, an enjoyable life,
where their work is enough to survive and support their families."

And [this is where [social and economic forces]{.mark} **start to
[align]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} very interesting and **potentially
[powerful ways]{.mark}**[. And]{.mark} **open the door** for seeing
electoral strategies in an agenda based on innovations to **[take us
beyond]{.mark} traditional [growth-at-all-costs]{.mark}
economics**]{.underline}.

Consider a few facts: [**More than 50%** of millennials say they would
take a pay cut to find work that matches their values, while **90%**
want to use their skills for good. And these trends are **on the
up**]{.underline}. [Deloitte's]{.underline} 7th Annual Millennial
[Survey of]{.underline} 12,000 young people, for example--both
[millennials and gen Z]{.underline}--[reports **record low opinions of
businesses**. **Fewer than half** now believe that businesses behave
ethically, and this **directly affects** how loyal they feel to their
employers]{.underline}; 43% of millennials and a whopping 61% of
gen-Zers expect to stay in a job no more than two years. [And all this
against a backdrop of **general public opinion** that is also **looking
increasingly unkindly** on the economic paradigm we have.]{.underline}

[These]{.underline} are [conditions]{.underline} that can be worked
with. They [show that [there is a **large**]{.mark} and **[growing
instinct]{.mark}** out there [that thinks that we need **fundamental
change**]{.mark} to the way we do economics. [Not **tweaking**]{.mark}
**around the edges**, but **fundamental change** at the **very roots of
the global economy**]{.underline}. There is no neat or reliable evidence
to suggest that challenging infinite growth is at the top of peoples'
minds, or likely to be a particularly easy sell. But [there is
**significant doubt** in growth-at-all-costs capitalism, and that is an
**opportunity for innovation**. Combine that with the new thinking
coming out of places like the Wellbeing Alliance, and you can start to
sense the causes and conditions **may well be aligning in favor** of the
emergence of **wholly new**, **post-growth economies**. It]{.underline}
**cannot come soon enough**.

#### Growth-oriented AI ensures extinction\-\--degrowth solves

**Pueyo '18** \[Salvador; 8 Department of Evolutionary Biology, Ecology,
and Environmental Sciences, Universitat de Barcelona; Oct 1; "Growth,
Degrowth, and the Challenge of Artificial Superintelligence." Journal of
Cleaner Production, vol. 197, pp. 1731--1736\]

[The challenges of **sustainability** and of **superintelligence** are
**not independent**. The changing]{.underline} 84 [fluxes
of]{.underline} **[energy, matter, and information]{.underline}** [can
be interpreted as]{.underline} **[different faces of]{.underline}** a
**[general acceleration]{.underline}**2 85 . [More]{.underline}
**[directly]{.underline}**, it is argued below that
[[superintelligence]{.mark} would]{.underline} **[deeply
affect]{.underline}** 86 **[production]{.underline}** technologies and
also economic decisions, [and [could in]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[turn]{.underline} **[be affected]{.underline}** [by
the]{.underline}]{.mark} 87 **[[socioeconomic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
ecological **[[context]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[in which it
develops]{.underline}]{.mark}. Along the lines of Pueyo (2014, p. 88
3454), this paper presents an approach that integrates these topics. It
employs insights from a 89 variety of sources, such as ecological theory
and several schools of economic theory. 90 The next section presents a
thought experiment, in which superintelligence emerges after the 91
technical aspects of goal alignment have been resolved, and this occurs
specifically in a neoliberal 92 scenario. [[Neoliberalism is
a]{.underline} **[major force]{.underline}** [shaping current
policies]{.underline}]{.mark} [on a global level, which
urges]{.underline} 93 [governments to assume as their main role the
creation and support of capitalist markets, and to]{.underline} 94
[avoid interfering in their functioning]{.underline} (Mirowski, 2009).
Neoliberal policies stand [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[sharp
contrast]{.underline}]{.mark}** 95 [[to]{.underline} **[degrowth
views]{.underline}**]{.mark}: the first are largely rationalized as a
way to enhance efficiency and production 96 (Plehwe, 2009), and
represent the maximum expression of capitalist values. 97 The thought
experiment illustrates how **[[superintelligence]{.underline}]{.mark}**
perfectly [**[aligned]{.underline}** [with **capitalist**]{.underline}
98 [**markets** could have]{.underline}]{.mark} **[very [undesirable
consequences for humanity and the whole
biosphere]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It also 99 suggests that there is
little reason to expect that the wealthiest and most powerful people
would be 100 exempt from these consequences, which, as argued below,
gives reason for hope. Section 3 raises 101 the possibility of a broad
social consensus to respond to this challenge along the lines of
degrowth, 102 thus tackling major technological, environmental, and
social problems simultaneously. The 103 uncertainty involved in these
scenarios is vast, but, [if a non-negligible probability is assigned
to]{.underline} 104 [these]{.underline} two [futures, little room is
left for either **complacency** or **resignation**]{.underline}. 105 106
2. Thought experiment: Superintelligence in a neoliberal scenario 107
108 [Neoliberalism is creating a very **special breeding
ground**]{.underline} [for superintelligence, because it
strives]{.underline} 109 [to reduce the role of **human
agency**]{.underline} [in collective affairs]{.underline}. The
neoliberal pioneer Friedrich Hayek 110 argued that the [spontaneous
order of **markets** was preferable over **conscious
plans**]{.underline}, [because markets]{.underline}, 111 he thought,
[have more capacity than humans to process information]{.underline}
(Mirowski, 2009). [[Neoliberal]{.underline}]{.mark} 112 [[policies are
actively **transferring decisions to markets**]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Mirowski, 2009), while firms\' automated 113 decision systems become an
integral part of the market\'s information processing machinery 114
(Davenport and Harris, 2005). Neoliberal globalization is locking
governments in the role of mere 115 players competing in the global
market (Swank, 2016). Furthermore, [[automated
**governance**]{.underline} [is a]{.underline}]{.mark} 116
**[[foundational tenet]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of neoliberal
ideology]{.underline} (Plehwe, 2009, p. 23). 117 In the neoliberal
scenario, [most technological development can be expected to take place
either in the context of **firms**]{.underline} or in support of firms3
118 . A number of institutionalist (Galbraith, 1985), post119 Keynesian
(Lavoie, 2014; and references therein) and evolutionary (Metcalfe, 2008)
economists 120 concur that, in capitalist markets, [firms tend to
**maximize their growth rates**]{.underline} (this principle is
[related]{.underline} 121 but not identical [to the neoclassical
assumption that firms maximize profits]{.underline}; Lavoie, 2014).
Growth 122 maximization might be interpreted as expressing the goals of
people in key positions, but, from an 123 evolutionary perspective, it
is thought to result from [a mechanism akin to **natural
selection**]{.underline} 124 (Metcalfe, 2008). The first interpretation

managerial bureaucracy is a coherent social-psychological system with
motives and preferences of 126 its own (Gordon, 1968, p. 639; for an
insider view, see Nace, 2005, pp. 1-10), (2) this system is 127 becoming
techno-social-psychological with the progressive incorporation of
decision-making 128 algorithms and the increasing opacity of such
algorithms (Danaher, 2016), and (3) [human mentality]{.underline} 129

[Do economic downturns generate pressure for diversionary
conflict?]{.underline}

[Or might downturns]{.underline} [encourage]{.underline}
[austerity]{.underline} [and economizing behavior in foreign
policy]{.underline}? [This paper provides]{.underline} **[[new
ev]{.mark}idence]{.underline}** that [economic stress is associated with
**conciliatory policies** between strategic rivals]{.underline}. [For
states that view each other as **military threats**]{.underline}, the
[biggest step]{.underline} possible [toward]{.underline} bilateral
[cooperation is to terminate]{.underline} the [rivalry by taking
political steps to manage the competition]{.underline}.
[[Drawing]{.mark} on [data from]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[109]{.mark}

**[67]{.underline}** [of which terminated]{.underline}, the [evidence

**[[twice as likely to terminate]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[during]{.underline}]{.mark} **[economic

[controlling for]{.mark} **[all]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the **[main
[alternative explanations]{.mark}]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
[peaceful relations]{.underline} between foes (**[democratic
status]{.underline}**, **[nuclear weapons possession]{.underline}**,
**[capability imbalance]{.underline}**, **[common
enemies]{.underline}**, and **[international systemic
changes]{.underline}**), as well as many other possible confounding
variables. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} [research
[questions]{.mark}]{.underline} existing [theories claiming that
economic [downturns]{.mark} are [associated with **diversionary
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.underline}
[instead]{.underline}]{.mark} [[argues]{.mark} that in certain
circumstances **[peace]{.mark}** may **[result from]{.mark} economic
[troubles]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I define a rivalry as the perception
by national elites of two states that the other state possesses
conflicting interests and presents a military threat of sufficient
severity that future military conflict is likely. Rivalry termination is
the transition from a state of rivalry to one where conflicts of
interest are not viewed as being so severe as to provoke interstate
conflict and/or where a mutual recognition of the imbalance in military
capabilities makes conflict-causing bargaining failures unlikely. In
other words, rivalries terminate when the elites assess that the risks
of military conflict between rivals has been reduced dramatically. This
definition draws on a growing quantitative literature most closely
associated with the research programs of William Thompson, J. Joseph
Hewitt, and James P. Klein, Gary Goertz, and Paul F. Diehl.1 My
definition conforms to that of William Thompson. In work with Karen
Rasler, they define rivalries as situations in which "\[b\]oth actors
view each other as a significant political-military threat and,
therefore, an enemy."2 In other work, Thompson writing with Michael
Colaresi, explains further: The presumption is that decisionmakers
explicitly identify who they think are their foreign enemies. They
orient their military preparations and foreign policies toward meeting
their threats. They assure their constituents that they will not let
their adversaries take advantage. Usually, these activities are done in
public. Hence, we should be able to follow the explicit cues in
decisionmaker utterances and writings, as well as in the descriptive
political histories written about the foreign policies of specific
countries.3 Drawing from available records and histories, Thompson and
David Dreyer have generated a universe of strategic rivalries from 1494
to 2010 that serves as the basis for this project's empirical analysis.4
This project measures rivalry termination as occurring on the last year
that Thompson and Dreyer record the existence of a rivalry.

[[Economic crises lead to]{.mark} conciliatory behavior]{.underline}
[through]{.underline} [five]{.underline} primary [channels]{.underline}.
(1) [Economic crises lead to **[austerity
pressures]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} in turn [incent
leaders to search for ways to **[cut defense
expenditures]{.mark}**]{.underline}. (2) [Economic crises also encourage
**[strategic reassessment]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [so]{.underline} that
[leaders can argue to]{.underline} [their]{.underline} peers and their
[publics]{.underline} [that **defense spending can be
arrested**]{.underline} **[without endangering the state]{.underline}**.
[This]{.underline} can [[lead to **threat
deflation**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [where]{.underline}
[elites]{.underline} attempt to **[[downplay]{.mark} the [seriousness of
the threat]{.mark}]{.underline}** [posed by a former rival]{.underline}.
(3) If a state faces multiple threats, economic crises provoke elites to
consider threat prioritization, a process that is postponed during
periods of economic normalcy. (4) Economic [[crises increase]{.mark} the
**political** and **economic [benefit]{.mark}** [from]{.mark}
**international economic [cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Leaders
seek]{.mark} **foreign [aid]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[enhanced

**made easier if tensions are reduced**]{.underline} with historic

are [more prone to **select leaders**]{.underline} who are [perceived as
capable of **resolving economic difficulties**]{.underline},
[permitting]{.underline} the [emergence of leaders who hold **heterodox
foreign policy views**]{.underline}. Collectively, [these]{.underline}
mechanisms [make it much more likely that a leader will prefer
conciliatory policies]{.underline} compared to during periods of
economic normalcy. This section reviews this causal logic in greater
detail, while also providing historical examples that these mechanisms
recur in practice.

[Perhaps a skeptic wants to believe]{.underline} (as a kind of
anti-agent Moulder, of the X-Files' fame) [that extraterrestrial
intelligence is]{.underline} **[nonexistent]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} vanishingly **[rare?]{.underline}** To begin with, [it
would be]{.underline} **[strange]{.underline}** [to bet the long-term
future of humanity on such a technical astrobiological issue, on which
we can exert no influence whatsoever. [Extraterrestrial life
either]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[exists]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline}]{.mark} it does [**[not]{.mark}**, irrespectively of
any amount of]{.underline} our ethical or [political hand-wringing. So,
[lacking]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[specific
information]{.underline}**]{.mark} [for one or the other, [we should
certainly **make strategies for both**]{.mark}]{.underline} options.
[Further, the [advances of astrobiology]{.mark} over the last quarter

belief]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in the conclusion that life and
intelligence are]{.underline} **[reasonably abundant]{.underline}** [in
astrophysically and astrochemically permissible ecosystems]{.underline}.
Some of the arguments to that effect are summarized in Ćirković
(2012).11 Even if, by some quirk of astrobiological evolution, humanity
is the first intelligent species to arise in the Milky Way (as, for
instance, per the well-known argument of Carter, 1983, 2008), following
Torres's advice and relinquishing space colonization will simply ensure
that the second, third, or 275th intelligent species to evolve will
indeed colonize the Galaxy instead of humans. If, on the other hand,
Torres is wrong and it is possible to colonize the Galaxy in a peaceful
and prosperous manner, humanity might survive on Earth in a kind of zoo
or preserve, surrounded by friendly and considerate interstellar aliens
-- but obviously failing to realize its creative potential (which would
also count as an existential catastrophe in Bostrom's taxonomy).12

But suppose my main-line projection is correct and the \"probability of
an OK outcome\" / \"astronomical benefit\" scenario essentially comes
down to a race between Friendly AI and unFriendly AI. So far as I can
tell, [[the]{.mark} **most likely [reason]{.mark}** [we **wouldn\'t get
Friendly AI** is]{.mark} the [**total serial research depth** required
to **develop**]{.mark} and **implement** a **strong-enough theory** of
**[stable self-improvement]{.mark}**]{.underline} with a possible side
order of failing to solve the goal transfer problem. [[Relative
to]{.mark} UFAI[, FAI]{.mark} work seems like it would be **mathier**
and **more insight-based**, where [UFAI can]{.mark} **more [easily
cobble together lots of pieces]{.mark}**. This means that [UFAI
**parallelizes better**]{.mark} than FAI. UFAI also probably benefits
[from **brute-force computing power**]{.mark} more than FAI. Both of
these imply]{.underline}, so far as I can tell, [that **[slower]{.mark}
economic [growth is good news]{.mark} for FAI**[; it **lengthens the
deadline**]{.mark} to UFAI [and **gives us more time**]{.mark} **to get
the job done**]{.underline}. I have sometimes thought half-jokingly and
half-anthropically that I ought to [[try to find investment scenarios
based on]{.mark} a **continued Great [Stagnation]{.mark}** and an
**indefinite Great Recession** where the whole developed world slowly
goes the way of Spain]{.underline}, because these scenarios would
account for a majority of surviving Everett branches. Roughly, it seems
to me like [**[higher]{.mark} economic [growth]{.mark} speeds up time**
and **this [is not a good thing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I wish I had
more time, not less, in which to work on FAI; [I would [prefer]{.mark}
worlds in which this [research]{.mark} can **proceed [at a]{.mark}

f\. Competition among the superintelligent [If superintelligent agents
develop, we must contemplate the prospect of **competition among rival
powers**]{.underline}. The parallel here is to the game-theoretic
dynamics of weaponry. [Even though the innovators]{.underline} (of bows
and arrows, machine guns, tanks, nuclear weapons, and drones) [had an
initial advantage over their adversaries, their advantage was temporary.
Even the most closely held [technological secrets **diffuse slowly
around the world**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We must therefore assume that
[those who develop the engines of superintelligence will eventually find
they are soon **shadowed by their**]{.underline} military, commercial,
and political **[adversaries]{.underline}**. Moreover, [to the list of
adversaries will be added the **superintelligent machines themselves**.
We might take comfort in Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics]{.underline},
of which the First Law is, "A robot may not injure a human being or,
through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm." [But to take
refuge here would **surely be super-naïve**. It **would [only take one
unethical designer]{.mark}** []{.mark}to launch a superintelligent agent
who **did not incorporate the Laws of Robotics**. This would probably
**[launch an arms race]{.mark}** among rival superintelligent
powers]{.underline}. So the point here is that the approaching
Singularity is not one of unambiguous economic and social improvement.
This was appreciated by nuclear-weapons developer John von Neumann
(1955): Useful and harmful techniques lie everywhere so close together
that it is never possible to separate the lions from the lambs. This is
known to all who have so laboriously tried to separate secret,
classified science or technology (military) from the open kind; success
is never more nor intended to be more than transient, lasting perhaps
half a decade. Similarly, a separation into useful and harmful subjects
in any technological sphere would probably diffuse into nothing in a
decade. XI. Concluding Comments on Singularity So [the conclusion as of
today is that "**the Singularity is not near**." This conclusion is
**based on several tests** that place the theory of the Singularity
**within the context of economic growth theory**]{.underline}. Much of
the computer science literature on the Singularity examines the growth
in specific sectors or processes (such as flops or storage), but the
economic perspective insists that the growth must be weighted by the
economic valuation of the good or service. The major insight of
economics is to emphasize the heterogeneity of both inputs and outputs
of the economic system. [It is **surely true** that technological change
in the production of raw computation has been **phenomenal over the last
century**]{.underline}. We can process information at a speed that is
millions of billions times faster and cheaper than was possible for the
fastest lightning calculators of the nineteenth century. [**Suppose that
trend continues indefinitely**, including the ability to **devise ever
more ingenious software** and]{.underline} artificial intelligence
(**[AI]{.underline}**). For increasing capabilities of computers to lead
to the Singularity would require that AI could encompass all human
activities, not just add numbers, solve equations, play chess, and
interpret speech; but also lay hands on patients, read bedtime stories
to children, and select presidential candidates. Whereas computerized AI
might do many routine tasks, the non-routine tasks are less easily
programmed, and they evolve over time in response to the economic
environment, including the environment of artificial intelligence
itself. Particularly if we view the world with potential
superintelligence as a competition between humans and machines, then we
definitely would need a team of humans to consider how to protect humans
from machines. We routinely spend 5% of output on defense, and this
might rise to a much larger number when faced with a more potential
enemies like superintelligent machines. So one occupation at least would
survive into the Era of Singularity. Whether other sectors and tasks
would be immune to the rise of superintelligence is an open question.
The empirical question is the degree of substitutability between
information and human efforts. Given the complexity of both humans and
jobs, it is unlikely that the question can be decided a priori. The
analysis above indicates that information and computers will come to
dominate the economy only if the informational capital takes a rising
share of inputs. This requires that the expenditure shares or input cost
shares of information rise over time, which in turn requires that the
volume of inputs rises more rapidly than the relative prices fall. We
can call these the "substitution tests" to be concise. There are six
tests on the supply side. The conclusions from the empirical tests
proposed here is that the substitution tests fail or are ambiguous for
four of six tests and succeed barely for two of the six tests. However,
the [[growth trajectories]{.underline}]{.mark} of the variables which
pass the test (the share of capital in total income and the share of
informational capital in total capital) **[[are extremely
slow]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Projecting the trends of the last decade
or more, it would be **in the order of a century** before
these]{.underline}]{.mark} variables [would **[reach the level
associated with the]{.mark} growth [Singularity]{.mark}**. The
conclusion is therefore that **the economic Singularity is not
near**]{.underline}.

Intelligence." MIT Technology Review.
https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602776/yes-we-are-worried-about-the-existential-risk-of-artificial-intelligence/.

Oren **[Etzioni]{.underline}**, a well-known AI researcher, [complains
about]{.underline} **[news coverage]{.underline}** of potential
long-term risks arising from future success in AI research (see "No,
Experts Don\'t Think Superintelligent AI is a Threat to Humanity").
[After pointing the finger]{.underline} squarely [at]{.underline} Oxford
philosopher Nick **[Bostrom]{.underline}** and his recent book,
Superintelligence, [[Etzioni complains that Bostrom's "main source of
data]{.underline}]{.mark} on the advent of human-level intelligence"
[[consists of]{.underline} **[surveys]{.underline}**]{.mark} on the
opinions of AI researchers. [He then surveys the opinions of AI
researchers, arguing that his results **refute Bostrom's**]{.underline}.
It's important to understand that [Etzioni is]{.underline} **[not even
addressing the reason Superintelligence]{.underline}** has **[had the
impact he decries]{.underline}**: its clear explanation of why
superintelligent AI may have arbitrarily negative consequences and why
it's important to begin addressing the issue well in advance. [Bostrom
does not base his case on predictions that superhuman AI systems
are]{.underline} **[imminent]{.underline}**. He writes, "It is no part
of the argument in this book that we are on the threshold of a big
breakthrough in artificial intelligence, or that we can predict with any
precision when such a development might occur." [Thus]{.underline}, in
our view, [Etzioni's article]{.underline} **[distracts]{.underline}**
the reader [from the]{.underline} **[core argument]{.underline}** [of
the book and directs an]{.underline} **[ad hom]{.underline}**inem
**[attack]{.underline}** [against Bostrom under the]{.underline}
**[pretext]{.underline}** [of disputing his survey results]{.underline}.
We feel it is necessary to correct the record. [One of us (Russell)
even]{.underline} [**contributed to Etzioni's survey**, only to see his
response being]{.underline} **[completely misconstrued]{.underline}**.
In fact, as our detailed analysis shows, Etzioni's survey results are
entirely consistent with the ones Bostrom cites. [How, then, does
[Etzioni]{.mark} reach his novel conclusion? By **[design]{.mark}ing [a
survey instrument that is inferior to Bostrom's and]{.mark} then
[misinterpreting the results.]{.mark}**]{.underline} The subtitle of the
article reads, "If you ask the people who should really know, you'll
find that few believe AI is a threat to humanity." So [the reader is led
to believe that Etzioni asked this question of the people who should
really know, while Bostrom did not. In fact, the]{.underline}
**[opposite]{.underline}** [is true: Bostrom did ask people who should
really know, but Etzioni did not ask **anyone at all**. [Bostrom
surveyed the top 100 most cited AI researchers]{.mark}. **[More than
half]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the respondents [[said they believe there
is a]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[substantial]{.underline}]{.mark}** (at
least 15 percent) **[[chance that the effect of human-level]{.mark}
machine [intelligence on humanity will be]{.mark} "on balance bad" or
"[extremely bad]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[(**[existential]{.underline}**]{.mark} [catastrophe]{.underline})."
[Etzioni's survey]{.underline}, unlike Bostrom's, [did not
ask]{.underline} **[any]{.underline}** [questions about a **threat to
humanity**]{.underline}. [Instead, he simply asks]{.underline}
**[one]{.underline}** [question about]{.underline}
**[when]{.underline}** [we will achieve superintelligence.]{.underline}
[As Bostrom's data would have already predicted, somewhat more than
half]{.underline} (67.5 percent) of Etzioni's respondents [plumped for
"more than 25 years"]{.underline} to achieve superintelligence---after
all, more than half of Bostrom's respondents gave dates beyond 25 years
for a mere 50 percent probability of achieving mere human-level
intelligence. One of us (Russell) responded to Etzioni's survey with
"more than 25 years," and Bostrom himself writes, of his own surveys,
"My own view is that the median numbers reported in the expert survey do
not have enough probability mass on later arrival dates." Now, having
designed a survey where respondents could be expected to choose "more
than 25 years," [Etzioni]{.underline} springs his trap: he
**[asserts]{.underline}** [that 25 years is]{.underline} **["beyond the
foreseeable horizon"]{.underline}** [and thereby deduces that **neither
Russell nor** indeed **Bostrom** himself believes that superintelligent
AI is a threat to humanity. This will come as a **surprise to Russell
and Bostrom**, and presumably to many **other respondents**]{.underline}
[in the survey]{.underline}. (Indeed, [Etzioni's headline could **just
as easily have been "75 percent of experts think superintelligent AI is
inevitable."**]{.underline}) [[Should we ignore catastrophic risks
simply because most experts think they are]{.underline} **[more than 25
years away]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[?]{.underline}** [[By Etzioni's
logic, we should also ignore]{.underline}]{.mark} the catastrophic risks
of **[[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline}
**[castigate]{.underline}** [those who bring them up]{.underline}.
Contrary to the views of Etzioni and some others in the AI community,
[pointing to long-term risks from AI is not equivalent to claiming that
superintelligent AI and its accompanying risks are
"imminent."]{.underline} The list of those who have pointed to the risks
includes such luminaries as Alan Turing, Norbert Wiener, I.J. Good, and
Marvin Minsky. Even Oren Etzioni has acknowledged these challenges. To
our knowledge, none of these ever asserted that superintelligent AI was
imminent. Nor, as noted above, did Bostrom in Superintelligence.

### AT: Adaptation---2NC

#### A confluence of crises will overwhelm our ability to adapt

I. 'Doomsday' Peering beyond scientific reticence. [[It
is]{.underline},]{.mark} I promise, [[worse than you
think.]{.underline}]{.mark} If your anxiety about global warming is
dominated by fears of sea-level rise, you are barely scratching the
surface of what terrors are possible, even within the lifetime of a
teenager today. And yet the swelling seas --- and the cities they will
drown --- have so dominated the picture of global warming, and so
overwhelmed our capacity for climate panic, that they have occluded our
perception of other threats, many much closer at hand. Rising oceans are
bad, in fact very bad; but fleeing the coastline will not be enough.
Indeed, absent a significant adjustment to how billions of humans
conduct their lives, parts of the [[Earth will]{.mark} likely
[become]{.mark} close to [uninhabitable]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
and other parts horrifically inhospitable, as soon as the end of this
century. Even when we train our eyes on climate change, we are unable to
comprehend its scope. This past winter, a string of days 60 and 70
degrees warmer than normal baked the North Pole, melting the permafrost
that encased Norway's Svalbard seed vault --- a global food bank
nicknamed "Doomsday," designed to ensure that our agriculture survives
any catastrophe, and which appeared to have been flooded by climate
change less than ten years after being built. The Doomsday vault is
fine, for now: The structure has been secured and the seeds are safe.
But treating the episode as a parable of impending flooding missed the
more important news. Until recently, permafrost was not a major concern
of climate scientists, because, as the name suggests, it was soil that
stayed permanently frozen. But Arctic permafrost contains 1.8 trillion
tons of carbon, more than twice as much as is currently suspended in the
Earth's atmosphere. When it thaws and is released, that carbon may
evaporate as methane, which is 34 times as powerful a greenhouse-gas
warming blanket as carbon dioxide when judged on the timescale of a
century; when judged on the timescale of two decades, it is 86 times as
powerful. In other words, we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost, twice
as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet,
all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved
up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86
times over. Maybe you know that already --- there are alarming stories
in the news every day, like those, last month, that seemed to suggest
satellite data
[showed](https://www.carbonbrief.org/major-correction-to-satellite-data-shows-140-faster-warming-since-1998)
the globe warming since 1998 more than twice as fast as scientists had
thought (in fact, the underlying story was considerably less alarming
than the headlines). Or the news from Antarctica this past May, when a
[crack](http://www.newsweek.com/antarctica-ice-shelf-larsen-c-crack-grown-618676)
in an ice shelf grew 11 miles in six days, then kept going; the break
now has just three miles to go --- by the time you read this, [it may
already have met the open
water](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/trillion-ton-iceberg-breaks-off-antarctic-ice-shelf.html),
where it will drop into the sea one of the biggest icebergs ever, a
process known poetically as "calving." But no matter how well-informed
you are, you are surely not alarmed enough. Over the past decades, our
culture has gone apocalyptic with zombie movies and [Mad Max
dystopias](http://www.vulture.com/2016/07/the-present-worse-than-fictional-dystopias.html),
perhaps the collective result of displaced climate anxiety, and yet when
it comes to contemplating real-world warming dangers, we suffer from an
incredible failure of imagination. The reasons for that are many: the
timid language of scientific probabilities, which the climatologist
James Hansen once called "scientific reticence" in a paper chastising
scientists for editing their own observations so conscientiously that
they failed to communicate how dire the threat really was; the fact that
the country is dominated by a group of technocrats who believe any
problem can be solved and an opposing culture that doesn't even see
warming as a problem worth addressing; the way that climate denialism
has made scientists even more cautious in offering speculative warnings;
the simple speed of change and, also, its slowness, such that we are
only seeing effects now of warming from decades past; our uncertainty
about uncertainty, which the climate writer Naomi Oreskes in particular
has suggested stops us from preparing as though anything worse than a
median outcome were even possible; the way we assume climate change will
hit hardest elsewhere, not everywhere; the smallness (two degrees) and
largeness (1.8 trillion tons) and abstractness (400 parts per million)
of the numbers; the discomfort of considering a problem that is very
difficult, if not impossible, to solve; the altogether incomprehensible
scale of that problem, which amounts to the prospect of our own
annihilation; simple fear. But aversion arising from fear is a form of
denial, too. In between scientific reticence and science fiction is
science itself. This article is the result of dozens of interviews and
exchanges with climatologists and researchers in related fields and
reflects hundreds of scientific papers on the subject of climate change.
What follows is not a series of predictions of what will happen --- that
will be determined in large part by the much-less-certain science of
human response. Instead, it is a portrait of our best understanding of
where the planet is heading absent aggressive action. It is unlikely
that all of these warming scenarios will be fully realized, largely
because the devastation along the way will shake our complacency. But
those scenarios, and not the present climate, are the baseline. In fact,
they are our schedule. The present tense of climate change --- the
destruction we've already baked into our future --- is horrifying
enough. Most people talk as if Miami and Bangladesh still have a chance
of surviving; most of the scientists I spoke with assume we'll lose them
within the century, even if we stop burning fossil fuel in the next
decade. Two degrees of warming used to be considered the threshold of
catastrophe: tens of millions of climate refugees unleashed upon an
unprepared world. Now two degrees is our goal, per the Paris climate
accords, and experts give us only slim odds of hitting it. The U.N.
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issues serial reports, often
called the "gold standard" of climate research; the most recent one
projects us to hit four degrees of warming by the beginning of the next
century, should we stay the present course. But that's just a median
projection. The upper end of the probability curve runs as high as eight
degrees --- and the [authors still haven't figured out how to deal
with]{.underline} that [[permafrost]{.mark} melt.]{.underline} The IPCC
[reports also don't fully account for the [albedo]{.mark}]{.underline}
effect (less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight, hence
more warming); [more cloud cover]{.underline} (which traps heat); [or
the dieback of forests]{.underline} and other flora (which extract
carbon from the atmosphere). Each of these promises to accelerate
warming, and the [history]{.underline} of the planet [shows that
[temp]{.mark}]{.underline}erature [[can shift as much as five
degrees]{.underline}]{.mark} Celsius [[within thirteen
years.]{.underline}]{.mark} The last time the planet was even four
degrees warmer, Peter Brannen points out in [The Ends of the
World](https://www.amazon.com/Ends-World-Apocalypses-Understand-Extinctions/dp/0062364804?ascsubtag=%5b%5din%5bp%5dcj4u5jzvo0000osy64knayino%5bi%5dAbwfZQ%5bz%5dm%5bd%5dD%5br%5dgoogle.com),
his new history of the planet's major extinction events, the oceans were
hundreds of feet higher.\* The Earth has experienced five mass
extinctions before the one we are living through now, each so complete a
slate-wiping of the evolutionary record it functioned as [a resetting of
the planetary clock]{.underline}, and many climate scientists will tell
you they are the best analog for the ecological future we are diving
headlong into. Unless you are a teenager, you probably read in your
high-school textbooks that these extinctions were the result of
asteroids. In fact, all but the one that killed the dinosaurs were
caused by climate change produced by greenhouse gas. The most notorious
was 252 million years ago; it began when carbon warmed the planet by
five degrees, accelerated when that warming triggered the release of
methane in the Arctic, and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth
dead. We are currently adding carbon to the atmosphere at a considerably
faster rate; by most estimates, at least ten times faster. The rate is
accelerating. This is what Stephen Hawking had in mind when [he
said](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/05/02/tomorrows-world-returns-bbc-startling-warning-stephen-hawking/),
this spring, that the species needs to colonize other planets in the
next century to survive, and what drove Elon Musk, last month, to
[unveil](http://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-mars-spacex-martian-city-625994)
his plans to build a Mars habitat in 40 to 100 years. These are
nonspecialists, of course, and probably as inclined to irrational panic
as you or I. But the many sober-minded scientists I interviewed over the
past several months --- the most credentialed and tenured in the field,
few of them inclined to alarmism and many advisers to the IPCC who
nevertheless criticize its conservatism --- have quietly reached an
apocalyptic conclusion, too: No plausible program of emissions
reductions alone can prevent climate disaster. Over the past few
decades, the term ["Anthropocene" has climbed out of academic discourse
and into the popular
imagination](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/06/anthropocene-debate.html)
--- a name given to the geologic era we live in now, and a way to signal
that it is a new era, defined on the wall chart of deep history by human
intervention. One problem with the term is that it implies a conquest of
nature (and even echoes the biblical "dominion"). And however sanguine
you might be about the proposition that we have already ravaged the
natural world, which we surely have, it is another thing entirely to
consider the possibility that we have only provoked it, engineering
first in ignorance and then in denial a climate system that will now go
to war with us for many centuries, perhaps until it destroys us. That is
what Wallace Smith Broecker, the avuncular oceanographer who coined the
term "global warming," means when he calls the planet an "angry beast."
You could also go with "war machine." Each day we arm it more. II.
[[Heat Death]{.mark}]{.underline} The bahraining of New York. Humans,
like all mammals, are heat engines; surviving means having to
continually cool off, like panting dogs. For that, the temperature needs
to be low enough for the air to act as a kind of refrigerant, drawing
heat off the skin so the engine can keep pumping. At seven degrees of
warming, that would become impossible for large portions of the planet's
equatorial band, and especially the tropics, where humidity adds to the
problem; in the jungles of Costa Rica, for instance, where humidity
routinely tops 90 percent, simply moving around outside when it's over
105 degrees Fahrenheit would be lethal. And the effect would be fast:
[Within a few hours, a human body]{.underline} would be [cooked to
death]{.underline} from both inside and out. Climate-change skeptics
point out that the planet has warmed and cooled many times before, but
the [[climate window that has allowed for human life is]{.mark} very
[narrow]{.mark}]{.underline}, even by the standards of planetary
history. [[At 11]{.mark}]{.underline} or 12 degrees of warming, [more
than half the world's [population]{.mark}]{.underline}, as distributed
today, [[would die of direct heat.]{.underline}]{.mark} Things almost
certainly won't get that hot this century, though models of unabated
emissions do bring us that far eventually. This century, and especially
in the tropics, the pain points will pinch much more quickly even than
an increase of seven degrees. The key factor is something called
wet-bulb temperature, which is a term of measurement as
home-laboratory-kit as it sounds: the heat registered on a thermometer
wrapped in a damp sock as it's swung around in the air (since the
moisture evaporates from a sock more quickly in dry air, this single
number reflects both heat and humidity). At present, most regions reach
a wet-bulb maximum of 26 or 27 degrees Celsius; the true red line for
habitability is 35 degrees. What is called heat [[stress comes]{.mark}
much [sooner.]{.mark}]{.underline} Actually, we're about there already.
Since 1980, the planet has experienced a 50-fold increase in the number
of places experiencing dangerous or extreme heat; a bigger increase is
to come. The five warmest summers in Europe since 1500 have all occurred
since 2002, and soon, the IPCC warns, simply being outdoors that time of
year will be unhealthy for much of the globe. Even if we meet the Paris
goals of two degrees warming, cities like Karachi and Kolkata will
become close to uninhabitable, annually encountering deadly heat waves
like those that crippled them in 2015. At four degrees, the deadly
European heat wave of 2003, which killed as many as 2,000 people a day,
will be a normal summer. At six, according to an assessment focused only
on effects within the U.S. from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, summer labor of any kind would become impossible in the
lower Mississippi Valley, and everybody in the country east of the
Rockies would be under more heat stress than anyone, anywhere, in the
world today. As Joseph Romm has put it in his authoritative primer
[Climate Change: What Everyone Needs to
Know](https://www.amazon.com/Climate-Change-Everyone-Needs-Know%C2%AE/dp/0190250178?ascsubtag=%5b%5din%5bp%5dcj4u5jzvo0000osy64knayino%5bi%5dkpnStB%5bz%5dm%5bd%5dD%5br%5dgoogle.com),
heat stress in New York City would exceed that of present-day Bahrain,
one of the planet's hottest spots, and the temperature in Bahrain "would
induce hyperthermia in even sleeping humans." The high-end IPCC
estimate, remember, is two degrees warmer still. By the end of the
century, the World Bank has estimated, the coolest months in tropical
South America, Africa, and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the
warmest months at the end of the 20th century. Air-conditioning can help
but will ultimately only add to the carbon problem; plus, the
climate-controlled malls of the Arab emirates aside, it is not remotely
plausible to wholesale air-condition all the hottest parts of the world,
many of them also the poorest. And indeed, the crisis will be most
dramatic across the Middle East and Persian Gulf, where in 2015 the heat
index registered temperatures as high as 163 degrees Fahrenheit. As soon
as several decades from now, the hajj will become physically impossible
for the 2 million Muslims who make the pilgrimage each year. It is not
just the hajj, and it is not just Mecca; heat is already killing us. In
the sugarcane region of El Salvador, as much as one-fifth of the
population has chronic kidney disease, including over a quarter of the
men, the presumed result of dehydration from working the fields they
were able to comfortably harvest as recently as two decades ago. With
dialysis, which is expensive, those with kidney failure can expect to
live five years; without it, life expectancy is in the weeks. Of course,
heat stress promises to pummel us in places other than our kidneys, too.
As I type that sentence, in the California desert in mid-June, it is 121
degrees outside my door. It is not a record high. III. [[The End of
Food]{.underline}]{.mark} Praying for cornfields in the tundra. Climates
differ and plants vary, but the [basic rule for staple cereal
crops]{.underline} grown at optimal temperature [is that [for every
degree of warming, yields decline by 10]{.mark} percent.]{.underline}
Some estimates run as high as 15 or even 17 percent. Which means that if
the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century, we may have
as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to
give them. And proteins are worse: It takes 16 calories of grain to
produce just a single calorie of hamburger meat, butchered from a cow
that spent its life polluting the climate with methane farts.
Pollyannaish plant physiologists will point out that the cereal-crop
math applies only to those regions already at peak growing temperature,
and they are right --- theoretically, a warmer climate will make it
easier to grow corn in Greenland. But as the pathbreaking work by
Rosamond Naylor and David Battisti has shown, the tropics are already
too hot to efficiently grow grain, and those places where grain is
produced today are already at optimal growing temperature --- which
means even a small warming will push them down the slope of declining
productivity. And you can't easily move croplands north a few hundred
miles, because yields in places like remote Canada and Russia are
limited by the quality of soil there; it takes many centuries for the
planet to produce optimally fertile dirt. [[Drought might be an even
bigger problem]{.underline}]{.mark} than heat, [with]{.underline} some
of the world's most [arable land turning]{.underline} quickly [to
desert.]{.underline} Precipitation is notoriously hard to model, yet
predictions for later this century are basically unanimous:
unprecedented droughts nearly everywhere food is today produced. By
2080, without dramatic reductions in emissions, southern Europe will be
in permanent extreme drought, much worse than the American dust bowl
ever was. The same will be true in Iraq and Syria and much of the rest
of the Middle East; some of the most densely populated parts of
Australia, Africa, and South America; and the breadbasket regions of
China. None of these places, which today supply much of the world's
food, will be reliable sources of any. As for the original dust bowl:
The droughts in the American plains and Southwest would not just be
worse than in the 1930s, a 2015 NASA study
[predicted](https://www.nasa.gov/press/2015/february/nasa-study-finds-carbon-emissions-could-dramatically-increase-risk-of-us),
but worse than any droughts in a thousand years --- and that includes
those that struck between 1100 and 1300, which "dried up all the rivers
East of the Sierra Nevada mountains" and may have been responsible for
the death of the Anasazi civilization. Remember, we do not live in a
world without hunger as it is. Far from it: Most estimates put the
number of undernourished at 800 million globally. In case you haven't
heard, this spring has already brought an unprecedented quadruple famine
to Africa and the Middle East; the U.N. has warned that separate
starvation events in Somalia, South Sudan, Nigeria, and Yemen could kill
20 million this year alone. IV. [[Climate Plagues]{.mark}]{.underline}
What happens when the bubonic ice melts? Rock, in the right spot, is a
record of planetary history, eras as long as millions of years flattened
by the forces of geological time into strata with amplitudes of just
inches, or just an inch, or even less. Ice works that way, too, as a
climate ledger, but it is also frozen history, some of which can be
reanimated when unfrozen. [There are now, trapped in Arctic ice,
diseases that have not circulated in the air for millions of
years]{.underline} --- in some cases, since before humans were around to
encounter them. Which means our immune systems would have no idea how to
fight back when those prehistoric plagues emerge from the ice. The
[Arctic]{.underline} also [stores terrifying bugs]{.underline} from more
recent times. In Alaska, already, [researchers have discovered remnants
of the 1918 flu that infected]{.underline} as many as [500
million]{.underline} and killed as many as 100 million --- about 5
percent of the world's population and almost six times as many as had
died in the world war for which the pandemic served as a kind of
gruesome capstone. As the BBC
[reported](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170504-there-are-diseases-hidden-in-ice-and-they-are-waking-up)
in May, scientists suspect smallpox and the bubonic plague are trapped
in Siberian ice, too --- an abridged history of devastating human
sickness, left out like egg salad in the Arctic sun. Experts caution
that many of these organisms won't actually survive the thaw and point
to the fastidious lab conditions under which they have already
reanimated several of them --- the 32,000-year-old "extremophile"
bacteria revived in 2005, an 8 million-year-old bug brought back to life
in 2007, the 3.5 million--year--old one a Russian scientist
[self-injected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0_Cu0FcPA) just out of
curiosity --- to suggest that those are necessary conditions for the
return of such ancient plagues. But already last year, a boy was killed
and 20 others infected by anthrax released when retreating permafrost
exposed the frozen carcass of a reindeer killed by the bacteria at least
75 years earlier; 2,000 present-day reindeer were infected, too,
carrying and spreading the disease beyond the tundra. [What concerns
epidemiologists]{.underline} more than ancient diseases [are existing
scourges relocated, rewired, or even re-evolved]{.underline} by warming.
The first effect is geographical. Before the early-modern period, when
adventuring sailboats accelerated the mixing of peoples and their bugs,
human provinciality was a guard against pandemic. Today, even with
globalization and the enormous intermingling of human populations, our
ecosystems are mostly stable, and this functions as another limit, but
global warming will scramble those ecosystems and help disease trespass
those limits as surely as Cortés did. You don't worry much about dengue
or malaria if you are living in Maine or France. But as the tropics
creep northward and mosquitoes migrate with them, you will. You didn't
much worry about Zika a couple of years ago, either. As it happens,
[Zika may also be a good
model](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/02/zika-virus-gmo-mosquitoes.html)
of the second worrying effect --- disease mutation. One reason you
hadn't heard about Zika until recently is that it had been trapped in
Uganda; another is that it did not, until recently, appear to cause
birth defects. Scientists still don't entirely understand what happened,
or what they missed. But there are things we do know for sure about how
climate affects some diseases: Malaria, for instance, thrives in hotter
regions not just because the mosquitoes that carry it do, too, but
because for every degree increase in temperature, the parasite
reproduces ten times faster. Which is one reason that the World Bank
estimates that by 2050, 5.2 billion people will be reckoning with it. V.
[[Unbreathable Air]{.underline}]{.mark} A rolling death smog that
suffocates millions. [Our lungs need oxygen, but that is only a fraction
of what we breathe.]{.underline} The fraction of carbon dioxide is
growing: It just crossed 400 parts per million, and high-end estimates
extrapolating from current trends suggest it will hit 1,000 ppm by 2100.
At that concentration, compared to the air we breathe now, human
cognitive ability declines by 21 percent. Other stuff in the hotter air
is even scarier, with small increases in pollution capable of shortening
life spans by ten years. The warmer the planet gets, the more ozone
forms, and by mid-century, Americans will likely suffer a 70 percent
increase in unhealthy ozone smog, the National Center for Atmospheric
Research has projected. By 2090, as many as 2 billion people globally
will be breathing air above the WHO "safe" level; one paper last month
showed that, among other effects, a pregnant mother's exposure to ozone
raises the child's risk of autism (as much as tenfold, combined with
other environmental factors). Which does make you think again about the
autism epidemic in West Hollywood. [Already, more than 10,000 people die
each day from the small particles]{.underline} emitted from fossil-fuel
burning; each year, 339,000 people die from wildfire smoke, in part
because climate change has extended forest-fire season (in the U.S.,
it's increased by 78 days since 1970). By 2050, according to the [U.S.
Forest
Service](https://www.usda.gov/oce/climate_change/effects_2012/FS_Climate1114%20opt.pdf),
wildfires will be twice as destructive as they are today; in some
places, the area burned could grow fivefold. What worries people even
more is the effect that would have on emissions, especially when the
fires ravage forests arising out of peat. Peatland fires in Indonesia in
1997, for instance, added to the global CO2 release by up to 40 percent,
and more burning only means more warming only means more burning. There
is also the terrifying possibility that rain forests like the Amazon,
which in 2010 suffered its second "hundred-year drought" in the space of
five years, could dry out enough to become vulnerable to these kinds of
devastating, rolling forest fires --- which would not only expel
enormous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere but also shrink the size
of the forest. That is especially bad because the Amazon alone provides
20 percent of our oxygen. Then there are the more familiar forms of
pollution. In 2013, melting Arctic ice remodeled Asian weather patterns,
depriving industrial China of the natural ventilation systems it had
come to depend on, which blanketed much of the country's north in an
unbreathable smog. Literally unbreathable. A metric called the Air
Quality Index categorizes the risks and tops out at the 301-to-500
range, warning of "serious aggravation of heart or lung disease and
premature mortality in persons with cardiopulmonary disease and the
elderly" and, for all others, "serious risk of respiratory effects"; at
that level, "everyone should avoid all outdoor exertion." The Chinese
"[airpocalypse]{.underline}" of 2013 peaked at what would have been an
Air Quality Index of over 800. That year, smog was responsible for a
third of all deaths in the country. VI. [Perpetual War]{.underline} The
violence baked into heat. Climatologists are very careful when talking
about Syria. They want you to know that while climate change did produce
a drought that contributed to civil war, it is not exactly fair to
saythat the conflict is the result of warming; next door, for instance,
Lebanon suffered the same crop failures. But researchers like Marshall
Burke and Solomon Hsiang have managed to quantify some of the
non-obvious relationships between temperature and violence: For every
half-degree of warming, they say, societies will see between a 10 and 20
percent increase in the likelihood of armed conflict. In climate
science, nothing is simple, but the arithmetic is harrowing: A planet
five degrees warmer would have at least half again as many wars as we do
today. Overall, [[social conflict could more than double]{.mark} this
century.]{.underline} This is one reason that, as nearly every climate
scientist I spoke to pointed out, the U.S. military is obsessed with
climate change: The drowning of all American Navy bases by sea-level
rise is trouble enough, but being the world's policeman is quite a bit
harder when the crime rate doubles. Of course, it's not just Syria where
climate has contributed to conflict. Some speculate that the elevated
level of strife across the Middle East over the past generation reflects
the pressures of global warming --- a hypothesis all the more cruel
considering that warming began accelerating when the industrialized
world extracted and then burned the region's oil. What accounts for the
relationship between climate and conflict? Some of it comes down to
agriculture and economics; a lot has to do with forced migration,
already at a record high, with at least 65 million displaced people
wandering the planet right now. But there is also the simple fact of
individual irritability. Heat increases municipal crime rates, and
swearing on social media, and the likelihood that a major-league
pitcher, coming to the mound after his teammate has been hit by a pitch,
will hit an opposing batter in retaliation. And the arrival of
air-conditioning in the developed world, in the middle of the past
century, did little to solve the problem of the summer crime wave. VII.
[Permanent Economic Collapse]{.underline} Dismal capitalism in a
half-poorer world. The murmuring mantra of global neoliberalism, which
prevailed between the end of the Cold War and the onset of the Great
Recession, is that economic growth would save us from anything and
everything. But in the aftermath of the 2008 crash, a growing number of
historians studying what they call "fossil capitalism" have begun to
suggest that the entire history of swift economic growth, which began
somewhat suddenly in the 18th century, is not the result of innovation
or trade or the dynamics of global capitalism but simply our discovery
of fossil fuels and all their raw power --- a onetime injection of new
"value" into a system that had previously been characterized by global
subsistence living. Before fossil fuels, nobody lived better than their
parents or grandparents or ancestors from 500 years before, except in
the immediate aftermath of a great plague like the Black Death, which
allowed the lucky survivors to gobble up the resources liberated by mass
graves. After we've burned all the fossil fuels, these scholars suggest,
perhaps we will return to a "steady state" global economy. Of course,
that onetime injection has a devastating long-term cost: climate change.
The most exciting research on the economics of warming has also come
from Hsiang and his colleagues, who are not historians of fossil
capitalism but who offer some very bleak analysis of their own: Every
degree Celsius of warming costs, on average, 1.2 percent of GDP (an
enormous number, considering we count growth in the low single digits as
"strong"). This is the sterling work in the field, and their median
projection is for a 23 percent loss in per capita earning globally by
the end of this century (resulting from changes in agriculture, crime,
storms, energy, mortality, and labor). Tracing the shape of the
probability curve is even scarier: There is a 12 percent chance that
climate change will reduce global output by more than 50 percent by
2100, they say, and a 51 percent chance that it lowers per capita GDP by
20 percent or more by then, unless emissions decline. By comparison, the
Great Recession lowered global GDP by about 6 percent, in a onetime
shock; Hsiang and his colleagues estimate a one-in-eight chance of an
ongoing and irreversible effect by the end of the century that is eight
times worse. The [scale of]{.underline} that economic [devastation is
hard to comprehend]{.underline}, but you can start by imagining what the
world would look like today with an [economy half as big]{.underline},
which would produce only half as much value, generating only half as
much to offer the workers of the world. It makes the grounding of
flights out of heat-stricken Phoenix last month seem like pathetically
small economic potatoes. And, among other things, it makes the idea of
postponing government action on reducing emissions and relying solely on
growth and technology to solve the problem an absurd business
calculation. of ice. VIII. [[Poisoned Oceans]{.mark}]{.underline}
Sulfide burps off the skeleton coast. That [the [sea will become a
killer]{.mark} is a given.]{.underline} Barring a radical reduction of
emissions, we will see at least [[four feet]{.mark} of [sea-level
rise]{.mark}]{.underline} and possibly ten by the end of the century. A
third of the world's major cities are on the coast, not to mention its
power plants, ports, navy bases, farmlands, fisheries, river deltas,
marshlands, and rice-paddy empires, and even those above ten feet will
flood much more easily, and much more regularly, if the water gets that
high. At least 600 million people live within ten meters of sea level
today. [But the drowning of those homelands is just the
start.]{.underline} At present, more than a third of the world's carbon
is sucked up by the oceans --- thank God, or else we'd have that much
more warming already. But the result is what's called ["ocean
acidification,"]{.underline} which, on its own, may add a half a degree
to warming this century. It is also [already burning through the
planet's water basins]{.underline} --- you may remember these as the
place where life arose in the first place. You have probably heard of
"coral bleaching" --- that is, coral dying --- which is very bad news,
because reefs support as much as a quarter of all marine life and supply
food for half a billion people. Ocean acidification [will fry fish
populations]{.underline} directly, too, though scientists aren't yet
sure how to predict the effects on the stuff we haul out of the ocean to
eat; they do know that in acid waters, oysters and mussels will struggle
to grow their shells, and that when the pH of human blood drops as much
as the oceans' pH has over the past generation, it induces seizures,
comas, and sudden death. That isn't all that ocean acidification can do.
Carbon absorption can initiate a feedback loop in which underoxygenated
waters breed different kinds of microbes that turn the water still more
"anoxic," first in deep ocean "dead zones," then gradually up toward the
surface. There, the small fish die out, unable to breathe, which means
oxygen-eating bacteria thrive, and the feedback loop doubles back. This
process, in which dead zones grow like cancers, choking off marine life
and wiping out fisheries, is already quite advanced in parts of the Gulf
of Mexico and just off Namibia, where [hydrogen sulfide is bubbling out
of the sea]{.underline} along a thousand-mile stretch of land known as
the "Skeleton Coast." The name originally referred to the detritus of
the whaling industry, but today it's more apt than ever. Hydrogen
sulfide is so toxic that evolution has trained us to recognize the
tiniest, safest traces of it, which is why our noses are so exquisitely
skilled at registering flatulence. Hydrogen sulfide is also the thing
that finally did us in that time 97 percent of all life on Earth died,
once all the feedback loops had been triggered and the circulating jet
streams of a warmed ocean ground to a halt --- it's the [planet's
preferred gas for a natural holocaust.]{.underline} Gradually, the
ocean's dead zones spread, killing off marine species that had dominated
the oceans for hundreds of millions of years, and the gas the inert
waters gave off into the atmosphere poisoned everything on land. Plants,
too. It was millions of years before the oceans recovered.

#### Climate change causes [extinction]{.underline} -- [their defense]{.underline} is based on [inaccurate]{.underline} models.

**Specktor '6/4** (Brandon Specktor, Senior Writer, \"Human Civilization
Will Crumble by 2050 If We Don\'t Stop Climate Change Now, New Paper

SB).

It seems every week there\'s a scary new report about how man-made
climate change is going to cause the collapse of the world\'s ice
sheets, result in the extinction of up to 1 million animal species and
--- if that wasn\'t bad enough --- make our beer very, very expensive.
This week, a new policy paper from an Australian think tank claims that
those other reports are slightly off; [[the risk]{.mark}s [of climate
change]{.mark} are actually much, much worse than anyone can
imagine.]{.underline} According to the paper, **[climate change [poses
a]{.mark}]{.underline}** \"near- to mid-term **[[existential threat to
human civilization]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" and [there\'s a good chance
**society could collapse**]{.underline} as soon as 2050 **[if serious
mitigation actions aren\'t taken]{.underline}** in the next decade.
Published by the Breakthrough National Centre for Climate Restoration in
Melbourne (an independent think tank focused on climate policy) and
authored by a climate researcher and a former fossil fuel executive, the
paper\'s central thesis is that [climate [scientists are]{.mark} too
[restrained in their predictions of how climate change will affect the
planet in the near future]{.mark}.]{.underline} \[Top 9 Ways the World
Could End\] [The current climate crisis]{.underline}, they say, [is
larger and more complex than any humans have ever dealt with before.
**[General climate model]{.mark}s**]{.underline} --- like the one that
the United Nations\' Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) used in 2018 to
predict that a global temperature increase of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2
degrees Celsius) could put hundreds of millions of people at risk [---
[fail to account for the sheer complexity of Earth\'s]{.mark} many
[interlinked geological processes]{.mark}]{.underline}; as such, [they
**fail to adequately predict the scale of the potential consequences.**
The truth]{.underline}, the authors wrote, [is]{.underline} probably far
[worse than any models can fathom.]{.underline} How the world ends What
might an accurate worst-case picture of the planet\'s climate-addled
future actually look like, then? The authors provide one particularly
grim scenario that begins with world governments \"politely ignoring\"
the advice of scientists and the will of the public to decarbonize the
economy (finding alternative energy sources), resulting in a global
temperature increase 5.4 F (3 C) by the year 2050. At this point, [the
world\'s ice sheets vanish; brutal droughts kill many of the trees in
the Amazon rainforest (removing one of the world\'s largest carbon
offsets); and [the planet plunges into **a feedback loop of
ever-hotter**]{.mark}**, ever-deadlier
[conditions]{.mark}.**]{.underline} \"[Thirty-five percent

population, are subject to more than 20 days a year of lethal heat

Meanwhile, [droughts, floods and wildfires regularly ravage the

to desert. Entire ecosystems collapse, beginning with the planet\'s
coral reefs, the rainforest and the Arctic ice sheets. The world\'s

### Environment Impact\-\--2NC

#### Dedev outweighs\-\--its try or die\-\--land, overfishing, deforestation, food and water shortages have cascading effects on bio-d that's key to survival

Richard **Smith 14**, economic historian, has written on capitalism and
the environment for The Ecologist, the International Journal of
Ecological Economics and Statistics, Real-World Economics Review, and
others, and has a PhD in economic history from UCLA. Green Capitalism:
The God That Failed,
truth-out.org/news/item/21060-green-capitalism-the-god-that-failed

Given the enormous dangers that such a high target implies, critics have
asked why Stern is so reluctant to aim for a safer target? Marxist
ecologist John Bellamy Foster and his colleagues suggest that the answer
is to be found in Stern\'s economics, not the science: The Stern Review
is very explicit, however, that such a radical mitigation of the problem
should not be attempted. The costs to the world economy of ensuring that
atmospheric CO₂e stabilized at present levels or below would be
prohibitive, destabilizing capitalism itself. \"Paths requiring very
rapid emissions cuts,\" we are told, \"are unlikely to be economically
viable.\" If global greenhouse gas emissions peaked in 2010, the annual
emissions reduction rate necessary to stabilize CO2e at 450 ppm, the
Stern Review suggests, would be 7 percent, with emissions dropping by
about 70 percent below 2005 levels by 2050. This is viewed as
economically insupportable.(39) Stern asserted that \"the world does not
have to choose between averting climate change and promoting growth and
development.\"(40) But [if the science is right that we need to keep
emissions below 400 ppm]{.underline}, or even get them back below 350
ppm, [then more growth is out of the question]{.underline}. Indeed, we
would have to make radically deeper cuts in GDP than even the 7 percent
reduction per year that Stern calculates would be necessary just to get
us down to 450 ppm. [Because, under capitalism, a contraction of
economic output on anything like that scale would mean economic collapse
and depression, it is difficult to see how we can make the reductions in
greenhouse gases we have to make to avoid climate catastrophe unless we
abandon capitalism.]{.underline} This is the dilemma. So far most
scientists have tended to avoid getting into the contentious economic
side of the question. But with respect to the issue of growth, the
science is unequivocal: Never-ending growth means the end of
civilization, if not humanity itself - and in the not-so-distant future.
For a summary of the peer-reviewed science on this subject, read a few
chapters of Mark Lynas\' harrowing Six Degrees.(41) [Global
warming]{.underline} is surely the most urgent threat we face, but it
[is far from the only driver of global ecological collapse]{.underline}.
For [[even if we switched to]{.mark} clean]{.underline}
[[renewable]{.mark} electric [power]{.mark} tomorrow]{.underline},
[[this would not stop]{.mark} the [overconsumption of forests, fish,
minerals,]{.mark} fresh [water.]{.mark} It would not stop [pollution
or]{.mark} solve the [garbage]{.mark} crisis [or]{.mark} stop the
changes in [ocean chemistry]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [the advent of
cheap, clean energy could even accelerate these trends]{.underline}.(42)
[Numerous credible scientific and environmental researchers]{.underline}
[back up what the climate scientists have been telling us, to
demonstrate why perpetual growth is the road to collective social
suicide]{.underline}. For example: In 2005 [the United Nations
Millennium Ecosystem Assessment team of [1,300 scientists]{.mark} from
95 countries issued a landmark report]{.underline} on humanity\'s
overconsumption of \"nature\'s services.\" [The scientists [reported
that]{.mark} 60 percent]{.underline} (15 of 24) [of]{.underline} the
[[ecosystems]{.mark} examined that are [critical for]{.mark} human
[survival are]{.mark} being \"degraded or used unsustainably,\"
including fresh water, capture fisheries, coral reefs, wetlands,
drylands and forests. Around the world]{.underline}, many of [these
are]{.underline} deteriorating or [[on the verge of
collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus [nature\'s ability to provide the
resources for growing future populations is]{.underline} very much [in
doubt unless radical steps are taken soon.]{.underline} In its Living
Planet Report 2010, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) similarly
concluded that [people are plundering the world\'s resources at a rate
that far outstrips the planet\'s capacity to sustain life.]{.underline}
As of 2007, [the world\'s]{.underline} 6 billion-plus [people were using
up 50 percent more natural resources per year than can be naturally
regenerated]{.underline} (and many resources, like oil, cannot be
replenished at all). Put another way, [humanity\'s current \"global
footprint\" is equal to 1.5 planets.]{.underline} Under a
business-as-usual scenario, even with modest projections for population
growth, consumption and climate change, [the UN predicts that by 2030
humanity will need the capacity of two Earths to absorb CO2 waste and
support natural resource consumption]{.underline}. Of course we don\'t
all consume equally: The footprint of high-income countries is three
times that of middle-income countries and five times that of low-income
countries. Americans have the biggest footprint of all, consuming the
most energy and producing the most waste. If everyone lived like
Americans do, we would need 5.3 planets to support all this. James
Leape, director general of WWF, says, \"The implications are clear. Rich
nations must find ways to live much more lightly on the Earth - to
sharply reduce their footprint, in particular their reliance on fossil
fuels. The rapidly growing emerging economies must also find a new model
for growth - one that allows for them to improve the well-being of their
citizens in ways the Earth can actually sustain.\"(43) And in its own
2010 State of the World Report, the World Watch Institute says that: As
consumerism has taken root in culture upon culture over the past
half-century, it has become a powerful driver of the inexorable increase
in demand for resources and production of waste that marks our age. \...
More than 6.8 billion human beings are now demanding ever greater
quantities of material resources, decimating the world\'s richest
ecosystems, and dumping billions of tons of heat-trapping gases into the
atmosphere each year. [[Despite a 30-percent increase in resource
efficiency, global resource use has expanded 50
percent]{.underline}]{.mark} over the past three decades. And those
numbers could continue to soar for decades to come as more than 5
billion people who currently consume one tenth as many resources per
person as the average European try to follow the trail blazed by the
world\'s affluent.(44)

### Chemicals Impact\-\--2NC

#### Growth causes [chemical emissions]{.underline} which cause extinction

**Cribb, 17**---principal of JCA, Fellow of the Australian Academy of
Technological Sciences and Engineering, former Director, National
Awareness, CSIRO (Julian, "The Poisoner," *Surviving the 21st Century*
Chapter 6)

There are two essential points about [[the]{.mark} Earthwide [chemical
flood]{.mark}]{.underline}. First it [is **quite new**]{.underline}.
[It]{.underline} began with the industrial revolution of the late
nineteenth century, but expanded dramatically in the wake of the two
world wars---where chemicals were extensively used in munitions---and
[[has exploded]{.mark} in deadly earnest in the past 50 years, attaining
a **new crescendo** in the early twenty-first century]{.underline}. It
is something our ancestors never faced---and to which
[[we]{.underline}]{.mark}, in consequence, [**[lack]{.mark} any
[protective adaptations]{.mark}** which might otherwise have evolved due
to constant exposure to poisons]{.underline}.

Second, [[the toxic flood is]{.underline}]{.mark}, for the most part,
[**preventable**. It is not compulsory---but is [a]{.mark}n **unwanted
[by-product]{.mark}** [of **economic growth**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Though driven by powerful industries and interests, it still lies within
the powers and rights of citizens, consumers and their governments to
demand it be curtailed or ended and to encourage industry to safer,
healthier products and production systems.

The issue is whether, or not, a wise humanity would choose to continue
poisoning our children, ourselves and our world.

Regulatory Failure

Despite the fact that around 2000 new chemicals are released onto world
markets annually, most have not received proper health, safety or
environmental screening---especially in terms of their impact on babies
and small children. [[Regulation has]{.underline}]{.mark} so far
[[**failed** to]{.mark} make **any serious [curtail]{.mark}ment** of
[this]{.mark} flood: only 21 out of 144,000 known chemicals have been
banned internationally, and this has not eliminated their
use]{.underline}. At such a rate of progress [it will take us **more
than 50,000 years** to **identify** and **prohibit** or **restrict** all
the chemicals which do us harm. Even then, [bans]{.mark} will only apply
in a handful of well-regulated countries, and **[will not protect the
Earth system]{.mark}** nor **humanity at large**]{.underline}. Clearly,
national regulation holds few answers to what is now an out-of-control
global problem.

Furthermore, [[the]{.mark} chemical [industry is **relocating**]{.mark}
from the developed world]{.underline} (where it is quite well regulated
and observes its own ethical standards) [and into developing
countries]{.underline}, mainly in Asia, [where it is largely beyond the
reach of either ethics or the law]{.underline}. However, [its toxic
[emissions return to citizens]{.mark} in well-regulated countries [via
**wind**, **water**, **food**, **wildlife**]{.mark}, **consumer goods**,
**industrial [products]{.mark}** [and **people**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The bottom line is that it doesn't matter how good your country's
regulations are: you and your family are still exposed to a growing
global flood of toxins from which even a careful diet and sensible
consumer choices cannot fully protect you.

The wake-up call to the world about the risks of chemical contamination
was issued by American biologist Rachel Carson when she published Silent
Spring in 1962, in which she warned specifically about the impact of
certain persistent pesticides used in agriculture. Since her book came
out, the volume of pesticide use worldwide has increased 30-fold, to
around four million tonnes a year in the mid-2010s. Since the modern
chemical age began there has been a string of high-profile chemical
disasters: Minamata, the Love Canal, Seveso, Bhopal, Flixborough, Oppau,
Toulouse, Hinkley, Texas City, Jilin, Tianjin. Most of these display a
familiar pattern of unproductive confrontation between angry citizens,
industry and regulators, involving drawn-out legal battles that deliver
justice to nobody. By their spectacular and local nature, such events
serve to distract from the far larger, more insidious and ubiquitous,
universal toxic flood.

Chemists and chemical makers often claim that their products are 'safe'
because individual exposure (e.g. in a given product, like a serve of
food) is too low to result in a toxic dose, a theory first put forward
by the mediaeval scholar Paracelsus in the sixteenth century. This 'dose
related' argument is disingenuous, if not dishonest---as modern chemists
well know---for the following reasons:

Most chemicals target a receptor or receptors on certain of your body
cells, to cause harm. There may be not one, but hundreds or even
thousands of different chemicals all targeting the same receptor, so a
particular substance may contribute an unknowable fraction to an overall
toxic dose. That does not make it 'safe'.

Chemicals not known to be poisonous in small doses on their own can
combine with other substances in water, air, food or your body to create
a toxin. No manufacturer can truthfully assert this will not happen to
their products.

Chemical toxicity is a function of both dose and the length of time you
are exposed to it. In the case of persistent chemicals and heavy metals,
this exposure may occur over days, months, years, even a lifetime in
some cases. Tiny doses may thus accumulate into toxic ones.

Most chemical toxicity is still measured on the basis of an exposed
adult male. Babies and children being smaller and using much more water,
food and air for their bodyweight, are therefore more at risk of
receiving a poisonous dose than are adults.

Chemicals and minerals are valuable and extremely useful. They do great
good, save many lives and much money. No-one is suggesting they should
all be banned. But their value may be for nothing if the current
uncontrolled, unmonitored, unregulated and unconscionable mass release
and planetary saturation continues.

Chemical Extinction

Two billion years ago, excessive production of one particular poisonous
chemical by the inhabitants of Earth caused a colossal die-off and
threatened the extermination of all life. That chemical was oxygen and
it was excreted by the blue-green algae which then dominated the planet,
as part of their photosynthetic processes. After several hundred million
of years, the planet's physical ability to soak up the surplus O2 in
iron formations, oceans and sediments had reached saturation and the gas
began to poison the existing life. This event was known as [the 'oxygen
holocaust']{.underline}, and [is]{.underline} probably [the nearest life
on Earth has ever come to **complete disaster** before the
present]{.underline} (Margulis and Sagan 1986). Since it developed
slowly, over tens of millions of years, the poisonous atmosphere
permitted some of these primitive organisms to evolve a tolerance to
O2---and this in time led to the rise of oxygen-dependent species such
as fish, mammals and eventually, us. The takehome learning from this
brush with total annihilation is that [[it is possible for]{.mark}
living [creatures to **pollute themselves into oblivion**]{.mark}, if
they don't]{.underline} take care to [avoid it or rapidly adapt to the
new, toxic environment]{.underline}. It's a message that humans, with
our colossal planetary chemical impact, would do well to ponder.

While it is unlikely that [human chemical emissions]{.underline} alone
could reach such a volume and toxic state as to directly threaten our
entire species with extinction (other than through carbon emissions in a
runaway global warming event) or even the collapse of civilisation, it
is likely they [will emerge as a serious contributing
factor]{.underline} during the twenty-first century in combination with
other factors such as war, climate change, pandemic disease and
ecosystem breakdown. Credible ways in which [man-made [chemicals might
**imperil the human future**]{.mark}]{.underline} include:

[**[Undermining]{.mark} the [immune systems]{.mark}**, physical and
mental health of the population]{.underline} through growing exposure to
toxins

[**[Reducing]{.mark} the [intelligence]{.mark}** of current and future
generations]{.underline} through the action of nerve poisons on the
developing brains and central nervous systems of children, [[rendering
humanity **less able** to **solve its problems**]{.mark} and **adapt to
major changes**; and by increasing the level of **violent crime** and
**conflict** in society]{.underline}, which is closely linked to lower
IQ.

[**Bringing down the economy** through]{.underline} the **[massive
healthcare costs]{.underline}** of having to nurse, treat and maintain a
growing proportion of the population disabled by lifelong chronic
chemical exposure.

By **[[poisoning]{.mark} the [ecosystem
services]{.mark}]{.underline}**---clean air, water, soil, plants,
insects and wildlife---[[on which humanity **depends**]{.mark} **for its
own survival** and thereby contributing to potential **global ecosystem
breakdown**]{.underline}

### Phosphorous Impact\-\--2NC

#### Phosphorous depletion 

Charly **Faradji 16**, Doctor of Philosophy Student, Chemistry,
University of Bristol, "How the great phosphorus shortage could leave us
short of food," 2/17/16,
https://phys.org/news/2016-02-great-phosphorus-shortage-short-food.html

It\'s not as well-known as the other issues, but [phosphorus depletion
is]{.underline} no less [significant]{.underline}. After all, we could
live without cars or unusual species, but [if phosphorus ran out we\'d
have to **live without food**]{.underline}.¶ [[Phosphorus is]{.mark} an
**[essential]{.mark} nutrient [for all]{.mark} forms of
[life]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is a key element in our DNA and all
living organisms require daily phosphorus intake to produce energy. It
cannot be replaced and [[there is no]{.mark} synthetic
[substitute]{.mark}]{.underline}: [without phosphorus, there is no
life]{.underline}.¶ Our dependence began in the mid-19th century, after
farmers noticed spreading phosphorus-rich guano (bird excrement) on
their fields led to impressive improvements in crop yields. Soon after,
mines opened up in the US and China to extract phosphate ore -- rocks
which contain the useful mineral. This triggered the current use of
mineral fertilisers and, without this industrial breakthrough, humanity
could only produce half the food that it does today.¶ [Fertiliser
[use]{.mark} has [quadrupled]{.mark} over the past half century [and
will **continue rising**]{.mark} as the population expands]{.underline}.
The [**[growing wealth of developing countries]{.underline}** [allows
people]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to afford]{.underline}]{.mark} more
[[meat]{.mark} which has [a \"phosphorus footprint]{.mark}\" [50
times]{.mark} higher than [most vegetables]{.mark}]{.underline}. This,
together with the increasing usage of biofuels, is estimated to double
the demand for phosphorus fertilisers by 2050.¶ Today phosphorus is also
used in pharmaceuticals, personal care products, flame retardants,
catalysts for chemical industries, building materials, cleaners,
detergents and food preservatives.¶ Phosphorus is not a renewable
resource¶ Reserves are limited and not equally spread over the planet.
The only large mines are located in Morocco, Russia, China and the US.
Depending on which scientists you ask, the world\'s phosphate rock
reserves will last for another 35 to 400 years -- though the more
optimistic assessments rely on the discovery of new deposits.¶ It\'s a
big concern for the EU and other countries without their own reserves,
and [[phosphorus depletion]{.mark} could [lead to **geopolitical
tensions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Back in 2008, [[when fertiliser
prices]{.mark} sharply [increased]{.mark}]{.underline} by 600% and
directly influenced food prices, [[there were **violent riots**]{.mark}
in 40 different developing countries]{.underline}.¶ Phosphorus also
harms the environment. Excessive fertiliser use means it leaches from
agricultural lands into rivers and eventually the sea, leading to
so-called dead zones where most fish can\'t survive. Uninhibited algae
growth caused by high levels of phosphorus in water has already created
more than 400 coastal death zones worldwide. Related human poisoning
costs US\$2.2 billion dollars annually in the US alone.¶ With the
increasing demand for phosphorus leading to massive social and
environmental issues, it\'s time we looked towards more sustainable and
responsible use.¶ There is still hope¶ [In the past, the phosphorus
cycle was closed]{.underline}: crops were eaten by humans and livestock
while their faeces were used as natural fertilisers to grow crops
again.¶ [These days, the cycle is broken]{.underline}. Each year 220m
tonnes of phosphate rocks are mined, but only a negligible amount makes
it back into the soil. Crops are transported to cities and the waste is
not returned to the fields but to the sewage system, which mainly ends
up in the sea. A cycle has become a linear process.¶ [[We could reinvent
a]{.mark} modern [phosphorus cycle]{.mark} simply [by **dramatically
reducing**]{.mark} **our [consumption]{.mark}**]{.underline}. After all,
less than a third of the phosphorus in fertilisers is actually taken up
by plants; the rest accumulates in the soil or is washed away. To take
one example, in the Netherlands there is enough phosphorus in the soil
today to supply the country with fertiliser for the next 40 years.

Despite decades of effort, [[carbon capture]{.mark} and storage for

carbon capture, a technology touted by industry, has done little to
clean up coal. [We cannot afford further investment in a pipe dream that
**distracts us from developing real solutions and technologies** for
climate change.]{.underline} Yet policymakers, prodded by the coal
industry, continue to invest money and precious time to try to develop
carbon capture for coal­fired plants. The Department of Energy began
developing carbon capture in 1997, and since 2008, Congress has
allocated \$7 billion for carbon capture programs. Still, no
commercial­scale carbon capture power plant has gone online in the United
States, and the long list of abandoned projects in the United States and
abroad grows. [[Carbon capture is]{.mark} an [expensive]{.mark}
technology [requiring]{.mark} expansive [new infrastructure. This
includes]{.mark} potentially **[thousands of miles of]{.mark}
[pipeline]{.mark}** for transporting captured carbon dioxide
[and]{.mark} **maintenance** and **[monitoring]{.mark} of storage
[sites]{.mark}** to prevent leakage. Assuming such obstacles can be
overcome, [it is likely **too late**]{.mark} for carbon capture [to be
scaled up]{.mark} as needed to be an effective tool for combating
climate change.]{.underline} To achieve meaningful carbon dioxide
reductions, approximately 100 carbon capture projects must be online by
2020 and 3,000 by 2050. [No carbon capture project has been able to
capture the quantities of carbon dioxide promised.]{.underline} Also,
[carbon capture investment is not a smart strategy for reducing carbon
emissions. [To recoup costs]{.mark}, some [carbon capture]{.mark} power
plant [operators plan to sell carbon]{.mark} dioxide [to oil companies
to **help them extract more oil**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Also, because
carbon capture reduces a coal plant's efficiency[, [using carbon
capture]{.mark} actually **[requires]{.mark} the use of [more coal to
produce the same amount of energy]{.mark} than a plant without carbon
capture.** Putting costs, infrastructure issues and efficiency problems
aside, the use of carbon capture to reduce carbon emissions ignores the
harmful effects of coal on the environment and communities.]{.underline}
Regardless of any reduction in carbon achieved, [plants with carbon
capture **still release harmful air pollutants** and produce polluting
coal ash ponds. With or without carbon capture, the burning, storage and
extraction of coal disproportionately affects poor communities and
communities of color.]{.underline} We cannot afford further investment
in the carbon capture pipe dream that distracts the nation from
developing real solutions and adaptive technologies for climate change.
[Our energy and environmental future should not be dictated by the
narrow vision of the fading coal industry.]{.underline}

#### Leakage thumps

[Carbon sequestration promises to address greenhouse-gas emissions by
capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere]{.underline} and injecting
it deep below the Earth's surface, where it would permanently solidify
into rock. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that
current carbon-sequestration technologies may eliminate up to 90 percent
of carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. [While such
technologies may successfully remove greenhouse gases from the
atmosphere, researchers in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and
Planetary Sciences at **[MIT]{.mark}** have [found that]{.mark} once
injected into the ground, **[less carbon dioxide is converted to rock
than previously imagined]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The team studied the
chemical reactions between carbon dioxide and its surroundings once the
gas is injected into the Earth --- finding [that [as carbon dioxide
works its way underground, only a small fraction]{.mark} of the gas
[turns to rock. The]{.mark} remainder of the gas stays in a more tenuous
form.]{.underline} "[If it turns into rock, it's stable and will remain
there permanently," says postdoc Yossi Cohen. "However, if it stays in
its gaseous or liquid phase, it remains mobile and it can possibly
[return back to the atmosphere]{.mark}."]{.underline} Cohen and Daniel
Rothman, a professor of geophysics in MIT's Department of Earth,
Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, detail the results this week in the
journal Proceedings of the Royal Society A. Current geologic
carbon-sequestration techniques aim to inject carbon dioxide into the
subsurface some 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface, a depth equivalent
to more than five Empire State Buildings stacked end-to-end. At such
depths, carbon dioxide may be stored in deep-saline aquifers: large
pockets of brine that can chemically react with carbon dioxide to
solidify the gas. Cohen and Rothman sought to model the chemical
reactions that take place after carbon dioxide is injected into a briny,
rocky environment. When carbon dioxide is pumped into the ground, it
rushes into open pockets within rock, displacing any existing fluid,
such as brine. What remains are bubbles of carbon dioxide, along with
carbon dioxide dissolved in water. [The dissolved carbon dioxide takes
the form of bicarbonate and carbonic acid, which create an acidic
environment. To precipitate, or solidify into rock, carbon dioxide
requires a basic environment, such as brine.]{.underline} The
researchers modeled the chemical reactions between two main regions: an
acidic, low-pH region with a high concentration of carbon dioxide, and a
higher-pH region filled with brine, or salty water. As each carbonate
species reacts differently when diffusing or flowing through water, the
researchers characterized each reaction, then worked each reaction into
a reactive diffusion model --- a simulation of chemical reactions as
carbon dioxide flows through a briny, rocky environment. When the team
analyzed the chemical reactions between regions rich in carbon dioxide
and regions of brine, they found that the carbon dioxide solidifies ---
but only at the interface. [The reaction essentially creates a solid
wall at the point where carbon dioxide meets brine, keeping the bulk of
the carbon dioxide from reacting with the brine.]{.underline} "This can
basically close the channel, and no more material can move farther into
the brine, because as soon as it touches the brine, it will become
solid," Cohen says. "[The expectation was that most of the carbon
dioxide would become solid mineral. Our work suggests that significantly
less will precipitate."]{.underline}

[We affirm the need and human capacity for accelerated, active, and
conscious decoupling.]{.underline} Technological progress is not
inevitable. [Decoupling environmental impacts from economic outputs [is
not]{.mark} simply [a function of market-driven innovation]{.mark} and
efficient response to scarcity]{.underline}. The long arc of human
transformation of natural environments through [technologies began well
before there existed anything resembling a market or a price
signal]{.underline}. Thanks to rising demand, scarcity, inspiration, and
serendipity, humans have remade the world for millennia. Technological
solutions to environmental problems must also be considered within a
broader social, economic, and political context. [We think [it is

Japan, and states like California, [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} shutter
nuclear power plants, recarbonize their energy sectors, and
[[recouple]{.mark} their [economies]{.mark}]{.underline} to fossil fuels

conflated, both by its defenders and critics, with capitalism, corporate
power, and laissez-faire economic policies. We reject such
reductions]{.underline}. What we refer to when we speak of modernization
is the long-term evolution of social, economic, political, and

**[[The manifesto]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which **[[does not include
sources or references]{.underline}]{.mark}**, is divided into seven
sections (The Communist Manifesto, by contrast, had only four) that puts
forth a vision of a future society, or a pathway to that society, that
is driven by the creation of new technologies, as well as the
"intensification" of human activities, that together would
"decouple\[e\] human development from environmental impacts (7). xv In
short, the manifesto rehashes the fantastical goal, long pursued by
neoclassical economists, of separating out the apparently desirable
stuff (morepeople, more affluence, more consumption) from the
undesirable stuff (waste, pollution, environmental degradation, and
declines in energy stocks). Key to the ecomodernist argument is the
narrative of modernity, or in more technocratic language,
"modernization." [The ecomodernists do not romanticize low-impact
indigenous or pre-industrial societies, and do not seem to value
anything about global societies that existed before, say,
**1750**]{.underline}, or those in the present that retain
non-industrial practices. [These people are simply and **backwardly
"undeveloped."**]{.underline}xvi At times, the manifesto reads like a
chapter from a Herbert Spencer tract; the love, admiration, and faith in
science and technology borders on the Victorian, and the mythos of
Progress, so essential to industrialism since the 19th century, is
bizarrely juxtaposed against more sober acknowledgements of humankind's
toll on the planet. Here's one example of this rather saccharine
metanarrative of Progress: "Personal, economic, and political liberties
have spread worldwide and are today largely accepted as universal
values. Modernization liberates women from traditional gender roles,
increasing their control of their fertility. Historically large numbers
of humans---both in percentage and in absolute terms---are free from
insecurity, penury, and servitude" (8-9). The ecomodernists view the
Industrial Revolution as a largely positive phase of human history that
increased life expectancy, allowed for technologies that increased human
wellbeing, produced modern medicine and the ability to more effectively
fight disease, and created systems that mitigated the effects of natural
disasters (8).

One does not need a degrowth perspective to understand that this
statement is highly questionable and that the effects of "modernization"
have been more complex than this liberationist narrative would suggest.
The "liberation" of women from "traditional gender roles" was due in
large part to the work of twentiethcentury suffragettes and feminists,
and had relatively little to do with industrialism in the narrow sense.
(And what about women in the non-Western industrialized world?) It is
important to acknowledge, moreover, that child labor and 16-hour days
for adults fuelled the Industrial Revolution and were ended only by
strike action taken by trade unions in the face of strong opposition by
industrialists. In thesecases, technology and industrial production were
the problem, for which collective, grass-roots action and resistance was
the solution. Further, the idea that there are fewer people in
"servitude" in 2015 than there were in the past is also a debatable
point. New research sponsored by the United Nations suggests that over
20 million people are currently working as modern-day slaves. xviii xvii
The total number of African slaves brought to the Americas by Europeans
between 1500 and 1850 was 12 million, although many millions more died
in waiting or in transit. At no single point, however, did the
population of African (or aboriginal) slaves come close to 20 million.
Slaves and subjugation certainly existed in other parts of the world,
too, but the notion that servitude has declined in real numbers over
time ultimately rests on the subjective interpretation on the word
"servitude." But the raw numbers are, here, beside the point. The point
is that [ecomodernism offers a peculiarly **whitewashed** and **sugary**
interpretation of industrial modernism, and fails to acknowledge that
the interrelated problems of **overconsumption** and **environmental
decline**]{.underline} [were not coincidental byproducts of those modern
industrial processes]{.underline}. [Industrial modernity]{.underline}
has certainly brought numerous benefits to humankind, but it [has come
at a **heavy toll**]{.underline}, [and one that **jeopardizes** the
possibility of creating a sustainable society.]{.underline}

The **[[technology-will-save-us thesis]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the
ecomodernists merely [restates]{.underline} the [optimism]{.underline}
of industrialists and many futurists [going back **two centuries** or
more]{.underline}, [but also borrows from the **technocratic** school of
thought]{.underline} within sustainability that is often associated with
Amory Lovins.xx The ecomodernists paper over the highly destructive
nature of modern technologies throughout the manifesto, or else
[[**exaggerate** the benefits of **emergent technologies**]{.underline},
[such as the **dubious** and]{.underline} ]{.mark}[largely
[**untested**]{.mark} systems for **[carbon capture]{.mark} and
storage**]{.underline} (24). "Given that humans are completely dependent
on the living biosphere, how is it possible that people are doing so
much damage to natural systems without doing more harm to
themselves?"(9). It comes as news to us that humans are not doing harm
to themselves. The World Health Organization reported recently that in
2012 around 7 million people died---that is, one in eight of total
global deaths---"as a result of air pollution exposure," the vast
majority of which was emitted via "modern" technologies. xxiii xxi In
the 1970s, Paul Ehrlich developed the metric I = PAT, in which the
overall impact of a society is determined by the factors of population,
affluence, and technology. xxii This metric was invented as a caution
toward overly simplistic acceptance of technologies, but the
ecomodernists set aside this concern (28) and assume that more
technology is necessarily the solution. [**The Manifesto** is **silent**
on the topic of **geoengineering**, but one worries that the
ecomodernists support this fraught and **highly risky** response to
climate change.]{.underline}

The ecomodernists scoff at the idea of "limits to growth," arguing that
technology will always find a way to overcome those limits. "Despite
frequent assertions starting in the 1970s of fundamental 'limits to
growth,' there is still remarkably little evidence that human
populations and economic expansion will outstrip the capacity to grow
food or procure critical material resources in the foreseeable future"
(9).xxiv Here is one of the first clues that the
**[ecomodernists]{.underline}** [agree with George H. W. Bush that the
limits to growth are, in the words of the former president, "**contrary
to human nature**."]{.underline}xxv Graham **[Turner]{.underline}**, Ugo
**[Bardi]{.underline}**, [and numerous others have shown through
**empirical research**]{.underline} that many of the modeled scenarios,
and the fundamental thesis, of the Club of Rome remain as relevant as
ever---that is, [that the human endeavor is **bumping up** against
**natural limits**]{.underline}. xxvii xxviii But what additional
evidence do the ecomodernists need to appreciate that the limits to
growth are being reached?

Richard Heinberg has demonstrated that the production of conventional
oil, natural gas, and heavy oil all peaked around 2010, despite, but
also due to, continued global reliance on **[fossil
fuels]{.underline}**, which [still comprise over **80%** of the world's
primary source of energy]{.underline}. The so-called Green Revolution
and [**chemically intensive** conventional farming]{.underline} has
polluted many of the world's waterways and lakes, and [has caused a New
Jersey-sized **dead zone**]{.underline} in the Gulf of Mexico. In North
America, the vast majority of the original humus content on **[arable
land]{.underline}** [has been lost to **agriculture** and
**monocultures**]{.underline}. There are 7 million tons of accumulated
non-biodegradable plastic debris caught in the eastern and western gyres
of the Pacific Ocean, and half of the fish biomass in the world's oceans
show traces of microplastic contamination.xxix [**Copper** will be in
short supply by as early as the 2030s]{.underline}, and a number of
**[rare Earth minerals]{.underline}** [will not be far
behind]{.underline}.xxx Perhaps the absolute limits to growth have not
yet been reached, but mounting evidence suggests that they are not far
off, and it behooves ecomodernists to consider that yet more growth
might not be the answer. [The history of industrialism to date suggests
that more growth will be coupled with **increasing environmental
costs**]{.underline}. xxxii xxxi It is also worth realizing that many
once-thriving societies, from the Anasazi to the Maya, collapsed due to
demographic, ecological, and social pressures. [**The limits to growth
are real**, even if their exact nature differs over time and
space.]{.underline}

Moreover, **[the ecomodernists' disregard for ecology and natural
systems is disturbingly anthropocentric]{.underline}**. That is, they
ignore or externalize the non-human casualties of growth. Even if
technology and human ingenuity enabled miraculously the endless growth
of "human populations and economic expansion"---why would we want this,
again?---this [**Biggering** would still generate **manifold
environmental impacts**]{.underline}. The collapse of the Atlantic
northwest cod fishery in the 1980s and early 1990s is merely one example
of **[ecological ruin]{.underline}** that [was facilitated by industrial
technologies]{.underline} (**[refrigeration]{.underline}**, new kinds of
**[ships]{.underline}**, new **[harvesting]{.underline}** materiel, and
so forth) and the naïve contempt for natural limits. When the Canadian
Federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans declared a much-belated
moratorium on the cod fishery in 1992, it brought to an end 500 years of
intensive cod harvesting, destroyed many Canadian maritime communities,
and put paid to the debate on natural limits. It is true that humanity
survived the decline of the Northern cod, but does the precipitous
decline of this fishery matter in the Story of Modern Progress?

[One of the **central arguments**]{.underline} [of the Manifesto is that
human-induced environmental impacts could one day become **"decoupled"**
from economic growth.]{.underline} As noted, this has long been the
fantasy of **[neoclassical economists]{.underline}**, who **[want to
have their cake and eat it, too]{.underline}**. But rather than
addressing the fundamental flaws of a growth-obsessed economy, the
ecomodernists assume that economic growth is both necessary and possible
in the long term and that, therefore, technology will have to do the
work of decoupling. "Decoupling of human welfare from environmental
impacts will require a sustained commitment to technological progress
and the continuing evolution of social, economic, and political
institutionsalongside those changes" (29). The authors argue that the
relative environmental impact of humans has decreased in some domains,
even though there has not been an absolute decoupling of these
aggregated impacts (11). They cite as evidence the fact that many
countries have reduced their carbon intensity over the past few decades,
meaning that they get more economic bang for their energy buck (20),
partly because of increases in energy efficiency. However, to hold
aggregate ecological impact over time constant with growth,
eco-efficiency would need to improve at the same rate as the economy
grows, which places a heavy burden on engineers and inventors. More
troublingly, [the ecomodernists fail to address the deeper problem that
[**absolute**, **aggregated** impacts have continued to
climb]{.mark}---the **concentration of [GHGs]{.mark}** in the atmosphere
is increasing, the **[extinction of species]{.mark}** chugs along at an
**alarming rate**, the Human Appropriation of Net Primary Production
(**[HANPP]{.mark}**) [remains **staggeringly high**]{.mark}, and the
world's **major ecosystems** have only become more degraded since the
middle of the last century.]{.underline} Moreover, there is no hint of
the [**Jevons Paradox**---the long-recognized enigma that increases in
**technological** and **energy** efficiency almost always increase
consumption, not decrease it, due to various **rebound
effects**]{.underline}. But the more profound dilemma is that
ecomodernism is still locked inside the business-as-usual, growth
paradigm. It is certainly true that a growing global economy will mean
greater impacts on the natural world and human health, which is why we
question the necessity of this growth.

Even the most anti-growth and pro-steady-state economists, from Herman
Daly to Daniel O'Neil, argue that some parts of the world, namely
Sub-Saharan Africa, could benefit from more economic growth. Many other
parts of the planet would benefit from less growth, or in any case, will
have to make do with a less busy economy. The point is that there needs
to be a more critical and qualitative approach to growth, and one that
jettisons GDP as a meaningful measure of economic well-being. But the
ecomodernists seem to assume that all growth is good, in
contradistinction to the degrowthists, who recognize that much of the
growth in the developed world, with its high levels of material
throughput and energy consumption, is "uneconomic" and leads to
long-term costs and environmental impacts. In other words, growth
backfires. Rather than leaving the developing world to play an
impossible game of catch-up with levels of energy and material
consumption in the developed world, what is needed is for the
high-consumption countries to cease treating the present growth model as
a limitless aspiration for others to follow.

[One of the most unfortunate results
of]{.underline} this [technophilism]{.underline} and Biggering-Is-Better
attitude [is the ecomodernists' adoration of
nuclear power.]{.underline} The environmental thinkers behind the
Manifesto seem to have followed James Lovelock into the misguided belief
that nuclear power is the only hope for humanity. xl Some passages rival
H. G. Wells' Anticipations (1901) in their gushing optimism in
Scientific Progress. Consider the following: "Human civilization can
flourish for centuries and millennia on energy delivered from a closed
uranium or thorium fuel cycle, or from hydrogen-deuterium fusion" (10).
"Nuclear fission presents the only present-day zero-carbon technology
with the demonstrated ability to meet most, if not all, of the energy
demands of a modern economy." (23) "We think it is counterproductive for
nations like Germany and Japan, and states like California, to shutter
nuclear power plants, recarbonize their energy sectors, and recouple
their economies to fossil fuels and biomass." (28) The reality is that
nuclear power has never played a major role in meeting the world's
energy demands, despite the fact that it was touted throughout much of
the middle and late twentieth century as a panacea for our energy woes.
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),
[[nuclear provides]{.mark} only [2 percent of]{.mark} the [world's
energy]{.mark}]{.underline}, although the International Energy
Association puts the number at 5.7 percent. xli These numbers are [still
well below those of renewables]{.underline}, which are pushing 15
percent of global energy consumption.x Indeed, there [are at least eight
reasons that [nuc]{.mark}]{.underline}lear [[power should not be seen as
a positive]{.mark} contribution]{.underline} from the standpoint of
sustainable development, and it is worth dwelling on them in detail,
since ecomodernism places so much emphasis on
nuclear. [First,]{.underline} nuclear power [has [never lived up
to]{.mark} its [expectations]{.mark}]{.underline} as a major energy
source, especially [when compared to]{.underline} its immense impacts
and [costs. Secon[d]{.mark},]{.underline} the [[building]{.mark}
of]{.underline} nuclear power [[plants is]{.underline}]{.mark} hugely
capital [[intensive]{.underline}]{.mark}, which seems to contradict the
Manifesto's call for "cheap, clean, dense, and abundant" energy sources
(24). [Third,]{.underline} nuclear
power [is]{.underline} a [nonrenewable]{.underline} resource [since [uranium ]{.mark}is
finite]{.underline}, and some energy [analysts project
that]{.underline} low-cost and [accessible stocks [could]{.mark}
[become]{.mark} quite [scarce]{.mark} by 2080. Fourth[, most countries
do not
possess]{.mark}]{.underline} uranium [[deposits]{.underline}]{.mark},
and therefore nuclear power prevents many countries from achieving
energy independence. [Fifth, most countries do
not currently have]{.underline} (or want, or could even consider) a
nuclear power plant. As of 2013, [only 31 countries had this capacity.
Sixth,]{.underline} nuclear [power and]{.underline} nuclear [weapons are
inherently linked]{.underline} since the ability to produce nuclear
power also establishes the material basis and expertise for making
nuclear weapons. It is not an energy source that creates the conditions
for long-term peace, as we have learned recently, once again, in the
standoff between Iran and the West. [Seventh,]{.underline} nuclear
[[waste is dangerous]{.mark}ly radioactive [and]{.mark} essentially
[impossible to store]{.mark}]{.underline} safely in the long term, since
the waste takes thousands of years to lose its radioactivity. The 440 or
so nuclear power plants that function today generate enormous amounts of
waste, much of which is still sitting on the grounds of the power
plants, while some has been stored in caves or dumped in the
ocean. [Eighth, and finally, nuclear power plants are prone to
catastrophic disasters]{.underline}---that is, environmental
impacts---such as the ones that occurred in 1986 at Chernobyl, and in
2011 at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan.xliii [[As a
result]{.underline}]{.mark} of these disasters, and these
concerns, [public [confidence]{.mark}]{.underline} in nuclear
power [[has waned]{.underline}]{.mark} considerably in most countries
around the world, and Even with future breakthroughs in nuclear
technology, the reality is that a nuclear power will always remain an
ecologically reckless endeavor. As a result of these disasters, and
these concerns, public confidence in nuclear power has waned
considerably in most countries around the world, and
some [[governments]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as in Germany, [[have
begun phasing out]{.underline}]{.mark} their remaining facilities. As
seen above, the ecomodernists do not like that citizens in Germany or
Japan are questioning nuclear power. Yet this indignation is insensitive
in the extreme. For starters, Japan is still coping with a major power
plant calamity, and one that has led to much soul-searching over the
future of energy in Japan. In Germany, the effects of the Chernobyl
disaster were direct and impactful. In West Berlin, for instance, the
prevalence of Down syndrome rose dramatically in the nine months
following the incident, which blanketed much of Western Europe in
radioactive fallout. It may very well be true, as the Manifesto notes,
that nuclear power is a low-carbon technology (at least, in the direct
production phases of the energy), but there are many other health and
environmental impacts to consider, not to mention the political and
economic ramifications of this technology. More nuclear power plants
will almost inevitably mean more disasters and more longterm storage
headaches. The ecomodernists seem particularly miffed that Germans want
to "recarbonize" their economy, since reducing nuclear will, according
to the Manifesto, require filling the void with coal (along with wind,
biomass, and solar), although this, too, is a complicated matter.
Renewable energy production has, so far, overcompensated for the decline
in production in nuclear energy, and there is every indication that it
could continue to do so. It is true that Germany, along with many other
countries, is still powered in part by coal. But Germany, unlike
national governments in Canada or the United States, has a long-term
energy plan to wean itself from fossil fuels.xliv Why abandon those
gains in favor of nuclear power (a proven liability) and carbon capture
and storage (which reinforces the fossil-fueled status quo)?

Rather than ramping up on dangerous forms of energy production to meet
increased economic activity, the world needs less (and also different)
economic activity and a sustainable population, which could then create
the possibility of powering the world via renewable resources. That is,
degrowthists and ecomodernists agree that economic growth creates energy
problems, but the two camps differ starkly in their response to this
dilemma. For the ecomodernists, population and economic growth are taken
as givens, and thus governments are forced into making difficult
decisions about energy, including support for conventional, hard
energies, from coal and gas to nuclear power. For degrowthists,
population growth and continued economic expansion are seen as
undesirable and essentially impossible in the medium term, and thus the
solution is to live within biophysical limits, and reduce global energy
demands to a level that could be safely met by renewables. To borrow a
book title from Ted Trainer, Renewable Energy Cannot Sustain a Consumer
Society.

The ecomodernists also assume that the increasing urbanization of the
planet is fundamentally positive. Dehli now counts 25 million people.
Beijing has over 21 million smog-chocked inhabitants. Mexico City, 20
million. Cities now occupy an astounding three percent of the Earth's
surface and house around four billion people (12), leading to
historically unprecedented densities of human clusterings. While urban
dwellers tend to have higher incomes and better access to societal
services than their rural counterparts, looking only at the average
number hides the deep inequalities within and across cities worldwide. A
city such as Mumbai has stunning inequalities, human suffering, public
health crises, slums, and dilapidated infrastructure. The relative
affluence of urban dwellers comes at a cost for the environment. Cities
are home to about half of the global population, but contribute about 80
percent of global GHG emissions. xlvii xlvi It is hard to see how yet
more urbanization will necessarily increase human wellbeing, as the
ecomodernists credulously contend. Economic growth has been accompanied
by mounting income inequalities in urban areas and beyond. In contrast
to the three decades of rapid growth following World War II, the little
growth that has been squeezed out of the economic system in recent years
has largely benefitted the richer strata of society, while cramming the
world's poor into densely packed cities, from China to Brazil. The
bright and powerful vision of economic growth---to provide the material
basis for a better life for all---bears little resemblance to the
current prospects of only accumulating the wealth of the richest while
destroying the environment and livelihoods of future generations and the
poorest and most vulnerable today.

Further, **[ecomodernism]{.underline}** [is **patently condescending**
toward]{.underline} peasants, **[farmers]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} those who support **[agrarian values]{.underline}**.
This Manifesto is not for Wendell Berry. The authors note that only two
percent of Americans are today engaged in farming, whereas half the
population lived and worked on farms in the 1880s (12)---a demographic
shift, it should be noted, that was facilitated by access to cheap and
abundant fossil fuels. The authors go so far as to say that humans need
to be "liberated" from agricultural labor, as though the production of
food were not an essential good in and of itself. [This very
**westernized** and industrialized **snobbery** toward
agrarianism]{.underline} is redolent of Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl
WuDunn's infamous and repugnant New York Times article, entitled "Two
Cheers for Sweatshops," which assumed that working in a wretched factory
in industrial China was perforce a better fate than working in a rice
paddy, as farmers in China have done for "forty centuries." From the
point of view of degrowth, a lower impact and less consumerist world
will require an increase in farming (and gardening) and greater
reconnections to the natural world. A sustainable global society will
need more than two percent of the population engaged in food production.
More generally, **[the Manifesto]{.underline}** [has **literally
nothing** to say about the impacts of **conventional farming**,
**monoculture**, pesticide-resistant **insects**, genetically modified
organisms (**GMOs**), and the increasing **privatization** of **seeds**
and **genetic material.**]{.underline} It implicitly implies that the
Green Revolution was an unqualified positive for humankind. **[The CEOs
of Monsanto and Nestlé would no doubt endorse this
manifesto.]{.underline}**

[The issue of **condescension** toward **indigenous cultures** is
particularly stark]{.underline} in the Manifesto. There is not a word
about religion, spirituality, or indigenous ecological practices, even
though the authors throw a bone to the "cultural preferences" for
development (26). But the core assumption is that "development" has only
one true trajectory, and that is to "modernize" along the lines of
Western, industrialized countries. [The conceit that technological
modernity is Progress is hugely favorable to the development path of the
Global North, but also **quasi-imperialist** in its assumption that the
rest of the world needs to reproduce, in]{.underline} fast forward,
[the]{.underline} European and **[Neo-European Industrial
Revolution]{.underline}**. How is it simultaneously true that industrial
modernity is both the problem and the solution? If the authors
acknowledge, as they do, that industrialism has produced manifold
negative impacts on the natural world, then why assume that yet more
industrialism will magically reverse this trend? Furthermore, the
ecomodernists do not seem to believe that the "developed" North has
anything to learn from the "less developed" Global South. Is it possible
that indigenous societies that lived sustainably for long periods of
time might have important lessons to teach the rest of the world? The
ecomodernists do not seem to think so.

Finally, [[**the Manifesto** often uses]{.mark} **misleading** (if not
downright [**false**)]{.mark} language in making its case]{.underline}.
[The passages on [deforestation are especially
**greenwashed**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, the ecomodernists
claim that three quarters of deforestation occurred before the
Industrial Revolution (16). This may be true, but as Williams (2002) has
shown, this is not really saying much.xlix Anatomically modern homo
sapiens have been around for 200,000 years, and it has taken only 250
years to produce one quarter of all recorded deforestation. This fact
does not strike us as particularly laudable, nor is it laudable that
pollutive fossil fuels replaced forest resources as the world's primary
form of energy. Also, on page 13, [the Manifesto manages to imply that
there is currently "net reforestation" occurring on the
globe]{.underline}, but [since **the text has no sources**, it is hard
to know the origin or particulars of this claim]{.underline}. The [[2014
Millennium Development Report shows]{.underline}]{.mark} that a
combination of afforestation and reforestation efforts has slowed
deforestation rates, but that the world still suffered a **[[net loss of
forested land]{.underline}]{.mark}** between 2000 and 2010 [[by many
**millions of hectares**]{.underline}]{.mark}.l Certainly, the vast
majority of those who study deforestation, including [the World Wide
Fund for Nature and the United Nations]{.underline}, **[contend
unequivocally]{.underline}** [that deforestation is an ongoing
concern.]{.underline} "For example[, in the Amazon around **17 percent**
of the forest has been lost in the last 50 years]{.underline}."li The
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's 2005 Forest Resources
Assessment paints a pretty bleak picture for the world's tropical
forests, and many of the temperate ones, too, noting that [loss of
woodland jeopardizes **essential ecosystem services**]{.underline}, a
concept that never appears in the Manifesto. lii

**[[Shooting sulfur]{.mark} particles [into the stratosphere to reflect
the sun]{.mark}?]{.underline}** Dumping iron into the ocean to boost the
absorption of carbon dioxide? Could these far-fetched and
dangerous-sounding schemes help avert potentially catastrophic effects
of climate change, or would they exacerbate conditions on our ever
warming planet? These strategies, which involve the deliberate and
large-scale intervention in our climate system to moderate global
warming, are known as geoengineering. Fantastical as they seem,
billionaires Bill Gates, Sir Richard Branson and others, are investing
millions of dollars into the geoengineering research of a few leading
climate scientists like Ken Caldeira at Stanford. At first, Caldeira
thought geoengineering sounded crazy too, but his research showed that
it would basically work. If global warming exceeds 2˚ C, it would be "a
prescription for disaster," said NASA scientist James Hansen. To prevent
this from happening, we need to cap atmospheric carbon dioxide levels at
350 parts per million; but in March 2012, we reached almost 394.5 ppm
and global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. Even if we were
able to immediately cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero, however,
global warming would continue for the foreseeable future because carbon
dioxide remains in the atmosphere for several hundred years. Moreover,
the international community has failed to reach an agreement that
tackles the fundamental problem of controlling carbon emissions and
prospects for doing so don't look good. As a result, geoengineering is
beginning to sound less like science fiction to some, and more like a
possible Plan B. Geoengineering strategies fall into two main
categories: Solar radiation management, which seeks to reduce the amount
of sunlight that reaches earth by deflecting it or increasing Earth's
reflectivity (albedo). Carbon dioxide removal, which tries to take
carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Solar radiation management
includes efforts like white roofs that deflect sunlight, brightening
clouds by shooting seawater into them to increase their albedo (salt
provides the nuclei that seed the clouds), and controversial strategies
based on the cooling effect that can follow major volcanic eruptions. In
1991, Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines erupted, sending 22 million tons
of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere. The sulfur particles scattered
around the globe, deflected sunlight, and cooled Earth by 0.4 to 0.5˚ C.
Solar radiation management would recreate this effect by using balloons,
aircraft or cannons to shoot tiny reflective particles like sulfates
into the stratosphere to temporarily block sunlight. The 1992 Panel on
Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming calculated that this strategy
would cost just pennies per ton of carbon dioxide mitigated. It would
also be fast-acting, capable of quickly reducing the impacts of heat
stress on crops, resulting in increased productivity since carbon
dioxide levels, which boost growth, would remain high. Other solar
radiation management ideas include the use of engineered nanoparticles,
which could be constructed to ascend high into the atmosphere and keep
their shiny side to the sun, and sunshades in space made of mirrors.
Solar radiation management would do nothing to address the root cause of
global warming---carbon dioxide emissions---or ocean acidification
caused by the sea's absorption of excess carbon dioxide. And while
stratospheric aerosols could theoretically produce cooling on a local or
global level, they might also create regional problems by affecting rain
and snowfall patterns and causing drought. According to Caldeira, a year
or two after Mt. Pinatubo, when aerosols dropped from the stratosphere,
both the Amazon River and the Ganges had very low flows and droughts
occurred. A 2010 study by ETC (Erosion, Technology and Concentration),
an international group that opposes geoengineering, states that [solar
radiation management]{.underline} climate models [[show a risk of
**increased drought over Africa**]{.underline},]{.mark} Asia and the

### AT: Nuclear

#### Nuclear energy fails

**Caradonna et al
15** (Jeremey, <http://www.ecomodernism.org/responses/2015/5/7/a-degrowth-response-to-an-ecomodernist-manifesto>,
EM)

[One of the most unfortunate results
of]{.underline} this [technophilism]{.underline} and Biggering-Is-Better
attitude [is the ecomodernists' adoration of
nuclear power.]{.underline} The environmental thinkers behind the
Manifesto seem to have followed James Lovelock into the misguided belief
that nuclear power is the only hope for humanity. xl Some passages rival
H. G. Wells' Anticipations (1901) in their gushing optimism in
Scientific Progress. Consider the following: "Human civilization can
flourish for centuries and millennia on energy delivered from a closed
uranium or thorium fuel cycle, or from hydrogen-deuterium fusion" (10).
"Nuclear fission presents the only present-day zero-carbon technology
with the demonstrated ability to meet most, if not all, of the energy
demands of a modern economy." (23) "We think it is counterproductive for
nations like Germany and Japan, and states like California, to shutter
nuclear power plants, recarbonize their energy sectors, and recouple
their economies to fossil fuels and biomass." (28) The reality is that
nuclear power has never played a major role in meeting the world's
energy demands, despite the fact that it was touted throughout much of
the middle and late twentieth century as a panacea for our energy woes.
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),
[[nuclear provides]{.mark} only [2 percent of]{.mark} the [world's
energy]{.mark}]{.underline}, although the International Energy
Association puts the number at 5.7 percent. xli These numbers are [still
well below those of renewables]{.underline}, which are pushing 15
percent of global energy consumption.x Indeed, there [are at least eight
reasons that [nuc]{.mark}]{.underline}lear [[power should not be seen as
a positive]{.mark} contribution]{.underline} from the standpoint of
sustainable development, and it is worth dwelling on them in detail,
since ecomodernism places so much emphasis on
nuclear. [First,]{.underline} nuclear power [has [never lived up
to]{.mark} its [expectations]{.mark}]{.underline} as a major energy
source, especially [when compared to]{.underline} its immense impacts
and [costs. Secon[d]{.mark},]{.underline} the [[building]{.mark}
of]{.underline} nuclear power [[plants is]{.underline}]{.mark} hugely
capital [[intensive]{.underline}]{.mark}, which seems to contradict the
Manifesto's call for "cheap, clean, dense, and abundant" energy sources
(24). [Third,]{.underline} nuclear
power [is]{.underline} a [nonrenewable]{.underline} resource [since [uranium ]{.mark}is
finite]{.underline}, and some energy [analysts project
that]{.underline} low-cost and [accessible stocks [could]{.mark}
[become]{.mark} quite [scarce]{.mark} by 2080. Fourth[, most countries
do not
possess]{.mark}]{.underline} uranium [[deposits]{.underline}]{.mark},
and therefore nuclear power prevents many countries from achieving
energy independence. [Fifth, most countries do
not currently have]{.underline} (or want, or could even consider) a
nuclear power plant. As of 2013, [only 31 countries had this capacity.
Sixth,]{.underline} nuclear [power and]{.underline} nuclear [weapons are
inherently linked]{.underline} since the ability to produce nuclear
power also establishes the material basis and expertise for making
nuclear weapons. It is not an energy source that creates the conditions
for long-term peace, as we have learned recently, once again, in the
standoff between Iran and the West. [Seventh,]{.underline} nuclear
[[waste is dangerous]{.mark}ly radioactive [and]{.mark} essentially
[impossible to store]{.mark}]{.underline} safely in the long term, since
the waste takes thousands of years to lose its radioactivity. The 440 or
so nuclear power plants that function today generate enormous amounts of
waste, much of which is still sitting on the grounds of the power
plants, while some has been stored in caves or dumped in the
ocean. [Eighth, and finally, nuclear power plants are prone to
catastrophic disasters]{.underline}---that is, environmental
impacts---such as the ones that occurred in 1986 at Chernobyl, and in
2011 at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan.xliii [[As a
result]{.underline}]{.mark} of these disasters, and these
concerns, [public [confidence]{.mark}]{.underline} in nuclear
power [[has waned]{.underline}]{.mark} considerably in most countries
around the world, and Even with future breakthroughs in nuclear
technology, the reality is that a nuclear power will always remain an
ecologically reckless endeavor. As a result of these disasters, and
these concerns, public confidence in nuclear power has waned
considerably in most countries around the world, and
some [[governments]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as in Germany, [[have
begun phasing out]{.underline}]{.mark} their remaining facilities. As
seen above, the ecomodernists do not like that citizens in Germany or
Japan are questioning nuclear power. Yet this indignation is insensitive
in the extreme. For starters, Japan is still coping with a major power
plant calamity, and one that has led to much soul-searching over the
future of energy in Japan. In Germany, the effects of the Chernobyl
disaster were direct and impactful. In West Berlin, for instance, the
prevalence of Down syndrome rose dramatically in the nine months
following the incident, which blanketed much of Western Europe in
radioactive fallout. It may very well be true, as the Manifesto notes,
that nuclear power is a low-carbon technology (at least, in the direct
production phases of the energy), but there are many other health and
environmental impacts to consider, not to mention the political and
economic ramifications of this technology. More nuclear power plants
will almost inevitably mean more disasters and more longterm storage
headaches. The ecomodernists seem particularly miffed that Germans want
to "recarbonize" their economy, since reducing nuclear will, according
to the Manifesto, require filling the void with coal (along with wind,
biomass, and solar), although this, too, is a complicated matter.
Renewable energy production has, so far, overcompensated for the decline
in production in nuclear energy, and there is every indication that it
could continue to do so. It is true that Germany, along with many other
countries, is still powered in part by coal. But Germany, unlike
national governments in Canada or the United States, has a long-term
energy plan to wean itself from fossil fuels.xliv Why abandon those
gains in favor of nuclear power (a proven liability) and carbon capture
and storage (which reinforces the fossil-fueled status quo)?

### AT: Industrial Ag

#### Localized ag works and industrial ag is unsustainable

**Alexander 16** (Samuel Alexander - lecturer at the Office for
Environmental Programs, University of Melbourne, Australia, PhD from
Melborne, 12-29-2016 "Frugal Abundance in an Age of Limits: Envisioning
a Degrowth Economy"

2.2 Food A foundational issue for any economy is how it sources and
produces its food, and this issue sits next to water on the list of
essential needs. [The [globalised, industrial food]{.mark} production
system currently in existence [is highly unsustainable]{.mark} for
various reasons]{.underline}. Not only are [industrial farming
[techniques causing]{.mark} the severe and widespread [erosion
of]{.mark} nutrient-rich **[topsoil]{.mark}**]{.underline} [([which
takes]{.underline}]{.mark} [many [hundreds of years]{.mark} to
rejuvenate]{.underline}), but also **[the industrialised system is
[extremely fossil fuel dependent]{.mark}]{.underline}** (see generally,
Brown, 2011). Natural gas is needed to produce commercial fertilisers,
and oil is needed to produce commercial pesticides, to fuel farm
machinery, and to create the plastics used in packaging. Furthermore[,
there are extremely [long supply chains]{.mark} that reach all around
the world and which [are dependent]{.mark} therefore [on oil]{.mark} for
transport]{.underline}. In Australia, for example, a basket of food from
the supermarket typically travels 70,000 kilometres from producer to
consumer, if the distance each item travels is aggregated (Salleh,
2007). With respect to the UK, one study has the figure at 241,000
kilometres (Sustain, 2001). This fossil fuel dependency is highly
problematic not only due to its link to climate change, but also because
it may not be economically sustainable as oil continues to get more
expensive (Rubin, 2009; Alexander, 2014a). [In]{.underline} a
[degrowth]{.underline} economy, [[food]{.mark} production]{.underline}
may [[need to be highly localised]{.underline}]{.mark}, organic, [and
[based on permaculture]{.mark}]{.underline} (Holmgren, 2002) or
'biointensive' (Jeavons, 2012) principles, in order to decarbonise
industrial methods. [One of the]{.underline} most significant, but often
overlooked, [implications of the transition away from industrial food
production is the increased human labour]{.underline} needed for organic
food production. The increased labour requirements arise [primarily from
the reduced reliance on energy-intensive, mechanised farm machinery, but
organic fertiliser production and pest control are also typically more
time intensive than industrialised techniques]{.underline}. **[[Organic
food production is entirely capable of feeding the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}** (United Nations, 2013; Jeavons, 2012), but
to do so will require a huge increase in the provision of agricultural
labour. This transition, however, will have many benefits, including
reconnecting communities with the local land base upon which they depend
for subsistence, [and the [health benefits]{.mark} associated with
moving away from sedentary office or factory work [toward]{.mark} the
[more active]{.mark} and outdoor work of [farming]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Mansen et al, 2004; Tremblay et al, 2010). Governments should do
everything they can to support localised, organic agriculture, starting
by putting a price on carbon. If they do not, grassroots movements
should localise food production as best they can without state support.
To begin with, a degrowth economy should aim [to [maximise]{.mark}
organic [food]{.mark} production [within the urban]{.mark}
boundary]{.underline}. This would involve digging up [lawns]{.underline}
and [turning]{.underline} them [into]{.underline} productive vegetable
[gardens]{.underline}, and planting fruit trees in all available spaces.
[Nature strips could be cultivated; parks could be turned into small
farms or community gardens; suitable roofs could become
productive]{.underline}, herbs could grow on balconies and windowsills,
and generally all food producing potential would be realised. [[Suburban
backyards]{.mark} could keep chickens for eggs, and]{.underline} perhaps
even [small livestock]{.underline}, such as goats for milk and cheese.
[Animals are]{.underline} also [a great source of manure for
compost]{.underline}, and many permaculturalists build animals into
their organic systems (Holmgren, 2002). There is also great potential
for building raised garden beds on driveways, some footpaths or roads,
and redundant car parks. Mushrooms could be cultivated on the shady side
of the house for protein [and]{.underline} household or neighbourhood
[[aquaculture systems]{.mark} could provide urban centres
with]{.underline} some of [their fish supply.]{.underline} Even in a
degrowth economy, however, we can expect our urban households to
'import' various foods in various forms, if not always from around the
world, then certainly from rural or peri-urban contexts. This, in fact,
would be an absolute necessity in dense urban contexts, because growing
space simply does not permit anywhere near strict self-sufficiency (see
McCrae et al, 2010). Even inspiring examples of urban agriculture, like
Havana, in Cuba (see Friedrichs, 2013; Percy et al, 2010), still require
the importation of food -- not only portions of its fruit and
vegetables, but also its meat, minerals, and other foodstuffs, such as
salt. The [[mainly local]{.mark} and organic food [production
would]{.mark} also [drastically change]{.mark} our [consumption
habits]{.mark}]{.underline}. Food would be eaten 'in season' in order to
avoid having to import non-seasonal foods from the other side of the
world. Preserving foods would be the most appropriate way to access
those foods out of season. Generally, food would be unprocessed and
require no disposable packaging. A robust carbon tax would significantly
increase the relative price of meat (especially red meat) and
consequently relative demand would significantly reduce, which is a
necessary part of low-carbon living. **[This transition to low- or
[no-meat diets would open up huge tracts of land]{.mark} for human food
production]{.underline}** or 'rewilding' (Monbiot, 2013) [that are
currently used to produce grain for animals]{.underline}.

### AT: Renewables

#### Renewables take too long

Harold **Wilhite 16**, Research Director at the University of Oslo's
Centre for Development and Environment and Academic Director of a
program entitled Environmental Change and Sustainable Energy, *The
Political Economy of Low Carbon Transformation: Breaking the habits of
capitalism*, 2016, no page numbers

The main within-capitalism solution for reducing energy-related climate
emissions is the replacement of fossil fuels with other energy sources
that do not emit carbon, such as sun, wind, geothermal and nuclear
power. As I have argued in several recent publications, [the
[transformation to renewable energies]{.mark}]{.underline}, while
important, [[will not happen fast enough]{.underline}]{.mark}, nor
assume a large enough share of global energy production over the next
couple of centuries to make a significant dent in carbon reductions
(Wilhite 2012). In the highest carbon-emitting country, the USA, [[even
the]{.mark} latest and [most ambitious plan]{.mark}]{.underline} for
reducing carbon emissions [[assumes]{.mark} that [70 percent of]{.mark}
primary [energy]{.mark} use [in 2030 will be from fossil
fuels]{.mark}]{.underline} (compared to 72 percent in 1990) and 15
percent from renewable energy sources (CSE 2015). The most lucrative
alternative source of energy, solar, has disadvantages relative to
fossil fuels regarding storage and production at scale which limit its
uses in industrial production and large-scale electricity production
(Altvater 2007). In Chapter 4 1 will argue that
[[mainstream]{.underline}]{.mark} \'green\' economy
[[approaches]{.underline}]{.mark} to reducing carbon [[are
overoptimistic]{.mark} in their assumptions about the capacity for
renewable energies]{.underline} to achieve urgently needed rapid and
significant decreases in carbon emissions. I will also argue that the
[consumption]{.underline} of the things that use energy [will have to be
reduced in numbers and size,]{.underline} including reductions in the
sizes of the houses in which we live and in the energy used to produce
essential in-home services such as thermal comfort, clean bodies, food
and transport. Achieving these reductions will demand challenging the
cornerstones of capitalist political economy --- growth, individualism
and consumerism --- and reforming the habits that this economic system
have fostered.

#### Logistic growth thumps scalability

J.P. **Hansen 17**, Department of Physics and Technology, University of
Bergen, "Limits to growth in the renewable energy sector," *Renewable
and Sustainable Energy Reviews*, Volume 70, April 2017, pp. 769-774

[Which [mechanisms have led to]{.mark} the apparent [logistic behavior
in wind and solar energy]{.mark}]{.underline} production? This cannot be
assessed from the present data, but we comment on four potential
saturation mechanisms that have been pointed at in previously published
studies: First, despite becoming increasingly competitive against other
technologies, some studies \[18,19\] suggest that unsubsidized renewable
energy, in spite of high annual learning rates \[20\], is presently more
expensive than alternatives on a direct cost basis.
[[Comparisons]{.underline}]{.mark} of this type [[are]{.mark} often
[made without taking into account all costs]{.mark}]{.underline}
associated with deployment of intermittent renewable energy sources. It
is well documented in the literature that these intermittent
technologies have different values for the system \[21,22\] in the sense
that they do not always lower system costs (grid + generation costs) if
deployed \[23\], everything else being equal. If this was not the case,
there would be little investment in conventional technologies today. A
second potential mechanism related to energy return on energy invested
(EROI) has been thoroughly discussed in several studies \[10--12\]: In
considering the ratio of energy produced vs. energy invested in the
build-up of large renewable energy systems these studies forecast an
optimum level in global renewable energy production well below what is
needed to satisfy the global demand. The origin of this limit was
considered to be limited area and increased expenses to build energy
production at increasingly more remote locations. A third saturation
mechanism is finite material life times which implies that there will be
an increasing need to renew existing power production sites \[11\]. This
mechanism, however, has hardly been important so far due to the early
stage, but will certainly increase with the aging of current
installations in coming years. A final saturation mechanism that applies
to intermittent sources of energy, like wind and solar, is that they
tend to [[cannibalize their own revenue]{.mark} streams]{.underline}
\[24\]. Assuming a constant price over a 24-h period, the deployment of
a limited capacity of solar PV can already make a dip in the market
price for electricity in hours when solar radiation is at its strongest.
Once installed, solar energy delivery has marginal costs close to zero
and assuming a well-functioning market, not distorted by subsidies, [[an
owner of solar PV will bid]{.mark} at a price down [towards zero]{.mark}
in order to enter the market.]{.underline} This drags the price down
during hours with solar capacity \[25\]. Hence, [[the more solar]{.mark}
capacity installed, [the lower the price]{.mark}]{.underline} in these
hours. At some stage, when the average market price is lower than the
long-run marginal cost of producing solar power during hours with solar
production, [[investors will lose interest]{.mark} in installing more
capacity since they cannot expect positive returns on their
investment]{.underline}. Current market designs thus limit how much
solar power can be deployed in a system. Consequently, regional plans
\[26\] for ruling out subsidies towards renewable energy without
compensating with other marked changing strategies are likely to
strengthen the marked contribution to a logistic pattern. 5. Conclusions
In this paper we have shown that at present [wind and solar power shows
[early signs of logistic growth]{.mark}]{.underline} despite high
learning rates and energy return on energy invested particularly within
the photovoltaics section \[27\]. Extrapolation of the logistic time
development for sun and wind combined suggests saturation of about 1.6

the COP 21 ambitions on climate gas reductions hard to achieve. We are
well aware of the uncertainties \[8\] with the logistic forecast:
Technology development, e.g. in ocean wind energy, and unforeseen
breakthroughs of competing energy resources, e.g. nuclear fusion, may
cause the development to take a completely new route \[28\]. In absence
of such developments, however, the present data are an early warning of
a growing gap between expressed ambitions and an actual growth.

Lucas **Hahn 16**. Bryant University. April, 2016. Global Economic
Expansion and the Prevalence of Militarized Interstate Disputes.

Economic Factors Leading to Increased Militarized Interstate Disputes
Running counter to the arguments that global economic expansion has led
to a decline in MIDs throughout the world, there is a large body of
literature that claims the exact opposite. In particular, some authors
argue that the recent declines that have been observed are a direct
result of a decline in conflict after major spikes during the World Wars
and the Cold War. The following section will highlight four different
**[economic factors]{.underline}** that [are]{.underline} potentially
[leading to an **increase in MIDs**]{.underline}. These four factors
include: (1) imperialism and resources, (2) the "War-Chest Proposition",
(3) Neo-Marxist views on asymmetrical trade, and (4) interdependence
versus interconnectedness. 1. Imperialism and Resources The presence of
imperialism between the 17th and early 20th centuries was, in a way, a
precursor to globalization today. During this period of time the most
developed nations worked to expand their empires and in doing so, began
to connect the people of the world for the first time. However, while
there were many positive benefits of this expansion, there were also
many negative happenings that led to violent conflict. As Arquilla
(2009, 73) frames it imperialism involved commercial practices (often
supported by military force) that took advantage of the colonized people
and ultimately destroyed their way of life. Thus, the increased economic
expansion that was brought about in order to build the empire, often led
to violent encounters. More specifically, imperialism and the conquest
of particular regions was often done in an effort to gain access to that
region's natural resources. Authors such as Schneider (2014) state that
undeveloped nations or regions are often subject to what he refers to as
the "domestic resource curse". Basically, during the times of
imperialism, the more powerful nations would go to undeveloped areas and
take whatever they wanted or needed from areas that were rich with
resources5. This often involved a great deal of conflict and the native
people were often exploited. In modern times, [the presence of
**significant caches** of]{.underline} national
**[resources]{.underline}**, particularly in Africa, [has been shown to
**[lead to violence]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[as]{.mark} corrupt
[governments]{.mark}]{.underline} and warlords **[take
advantage]{.underline}** of those native to the area. Additionally, as
Barbieri (1996) points out, conflict over resources may not be limited
to an imperialist nation's encounter with the undeveloped region.
[Violent conflict can also exist between the multiple nations that are
**[compet]{.mark}**ing **[to gain access]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[or]{.underline} **[control [over]{.mark} natural
[resources]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in a given area]{.underline}. 2. The
"War Chest Proposition" Building on the previous discussion, Boehmer
(2010) proposes something that he calls the "War-Chest Proposition". [He
states that economic [growth]{.mark} can [lead to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[increased military/defense spending]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and that
this buildup of a nation's "war chest" may be used to pay for **new or
continuing military engagements**]{.underline} (251). In other words,
[increased economic power often leads to greater **capabilities** of the
nation-state as a whole]{.underline}. This is [particularly true in
terms of **military capabilities**]{.underline} [and in this way,
[nations]{.mark} may thus be [**able** to engage in]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[more conflict]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Furthermore, he argues that
[positive economic [expansion builds]{.mark} up the [confidence]{.mark}
of the nation [to a point where they]{.mark} may **[feel
invincible]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and thus, **engage in violent
conflict**]{.underline} [that will help them to continue to
expand]{.underline}. 3. Neo-Marxist Views on Asymmetrical Trade One of
the most supported arguments against the notion that economic expansion
promotes peace is that trade, brought about by [economic expansion,
actually **increases MIDs**]{.underline}. Many authors have in fact
argued that [increased]{.underline} **[economic
interdependence]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} increased
**[trade]{.underline}** [may have, in some ways, "**cheapened war**",
and thus made it **easier to wage war more frequently**]{.underline}
(Harrison and Nikolaus 2012).

Realist and rationalist critiques [Realists]{.underline}, who share the
economic nationalism and statist orientation of the old mercantilists,
[criticize the liberal [econ]{.mark}omic theory of peace]{.underline} on
a number of grounds. First of all, they argue (as do some non-realists)
that [even if it were true that trade has a pacifying effect, the
magnitude of the impact of trade on]{.underline} decisions for [war and
peace [is small relative to]{.mark}]{.underline} that of [[military and
diplomatic considerations]{.underline}]{.mark} (Buzan, 1984 ; Levy,
1989b ). Realists, like mercantilists, argue that [states are
motivated]{.underline} primarily [by power]{.underline} and that
[economic]{.underline} opportunity [costs of war are minor in the
context of the long-term struggle for power. Were the
Western]{.underline} liberal [democracies]{.underline} seriously
[concerned about the]{.underline} short-term [loss of trade when they
made decisions to go to war against]{.underline} the hegemonic threats
posed by [Germany in 1914 and]{.underline} again in [1939?]{.underline}
Realists also argue that [[trade]{.mark} and]{.underline} other forms of
[economic interdependence can]{.underline} actually [[increase the level
of]{.underline}]{.mark} militarized [[conflict]{.mark} rather than
reduce it]{.underline} (Barbieri, 2002 ). As Rousseau (cited in
Hoffmann, 1963 :319) argued, "...[[interdependence
breeds]{.underline}]{.mark} not accommodation and harmony, but
[[suspicion]{.mark} and incompatibility]{.underline}. "Among other
things, [interdependence creates increased opportunities for
conflict]{.underline}. [The greater the interdependence]{.underline}
between states, [the greater the number of things to argue
about]{.underline}. In addition, whereas liberals argue that economic
interdependence creates mutual dependence and incentives to avoid war,
realists argue that [interdependence [may]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[be
asymmetrical]{.mark}. Each is dependent on the other, but the degree of
dependence is uneven. The [less dependent]{.mark} [party]{.mark}
may]{.underline} be tempted to [[use economic coercion]{.mark} to
exploit the adversary's vulnerabilities and influence its
behavior]{.underline} relating to security as well as economic issues.

\[Business Cycle and War: A Literature Review and Evaluation, Advances
in Economics, Business and Management Research, Volume 68, International
Symposium on Social Science and Management Innovation,
https://download.atlantis-press.com/article/55913122.pdf\]//BPS

Through the comparison of the two views, it can be found that [both
sides are **too vague**]{.underline} in the description of the concept
of business cycle. According to economists such as Joseph Schumpeter,
the [business cycle is divided into four phases: expansion, crisis,
recession, recovery]{.underline}. \[12\] Although there are discords in
the division and naming of business cycle, it is certain that [they are
not **simply divided** into]{.underline} two stages of [rise and
recession]{.underline}. However, as mentioned above, [[scholars]{.mark}
who discussed]{.underline} the [relationship between business cycle and
war]{.underline} often [**[failed to divide]{.mark}** the [business
cycle]{.mark} into four [stages]{.mark}]{.underline} in detail to
analyze the relationship.

First, [war can occur at **any stage** of expansion, crisis, recession,
recovery, so it is **unrealistic** to assume]{.underline} that [wars
occur at **any particular stage** of the business cycle]{.underline}. On
the one hand, although the [domestic economic problems]{.underline} in
the crisis/recession/depression period [break out]{.underline} and
become prominent [in a short time]{.underline}, in fact, such challenge
exists [at **all stages** of the business cycle]{.underline}. When
countries cannot manage to solve these problems through conventional
approaches, including fiscal and monetary policies, they may resort to
military expansion to achieve their goals, a theory known as Lateral
Pressure. \[13\] Under such circumstances, even countries in the period
of economic expansion are facing downward pressure on the economy and
may try to solve the problem through expansion. On the other hand,
although the resources required for foreign wars are huge for countries
in economic depression, the decision to wage wars depends largely on the
consideration of the gain and loss of wars. Even during depression,
governments can raise funding for war by issuing bonds. Argentina, for
example, was mired in economic stagflation before the war on the
Malvinas islands (also known as the Falkland islands in the UK). In
fact, many governments would dramatically increase their expenditure to
stimulate the economy during the recession, and economically war is the
same as these policies, so the claim that a depressed economy cannot
support a war is unfounded. In addition, during the crisis period of the
business cycle, which is the early stage of the economic downturn,
despite the economic crisis and potential depression, the country still
retains the ability to start wars based on its economic and military
power. Based on the above understanding, [[war has]{.mark} the
conditions and [reasons]{.mark} for its outbreak [in **all
stages**]{.mark} **of the business cycle**.]{.underline}

Second, [**the economic [origin]{.mark}** for]{.underline} the outbreak
of [war [is **downward pressure**]{.mark} **on the economy** rather than
optimism or competition for monopoly capital, which may exist
during]{.underline} economic recession or economic
**[prosperity]{.underline}**. This is due to a fact that [during
economic prosperity, people are]{.underline} also [worried about **a
potential economic recession**]{.underline}. Blainey pointed out that
[wars **often occur** in **the economic upturn**]{.underline}, which is
[caused by the optimism in people\'s mind]{.underline} \[14\], [that is,
the **confidence to prevail**]{.underline}. This interpretation linking
optimism and war ignores the strength contrast between the warring
parties. Not all wars are equally comprehensive, and there have always
been wars of unequal strength. In such a war, one of the parties tends
to have an absolute advantage, so the expectation of the outcome of the
war is not directly related to the economic situation of the country.
[Optimism]{.underline} is not a major factor leading to war, but
[may]{.underline} somewhat [serve as **stimulation**]{.underline}. In
addition, Lenin attributed the war to competition between monopoly
capital. This theory may seem plausible, but its scope of application is
obviously too narrow. Lenin\'s theory of imperialism is only applicable
to developed capitalist countries in the late stage of the development
capitalism, but in reality, many wars take place among developing
countries whose economies are still at their beginning stages.
Therefore, the theory centered on competition among monopoly capital
cannot explain most foreign wars. Moreover, even wars that occur during
periods of economic expansion are likely to result from the potential
expectation of economic recession, the \"limits of growth\" \[15\] faced
during prosperity \-- a potential deficiency of market demand. So the
downward pressure on the economy is the cause of war.

Third, the business cycle may be related with the intensity, instead of
the outbreak, of the war. Scholars who supported the first two views did
not pay attention to the underlying relationship between business cycle
and the intensity of war. Some scholars, such as Nikolai Kondratieff and
Joshua Goldstein, believes that the business cycle is not directly
related to the outbreak of war, but the outbreak of war during the
economic upswing appears to be more intense and persistent. In their
analysis of the business cycle and war, Kondratieff and Goldstein
discovered that [**the [most]{.mark} dramatic and [deadly wars]{.mark}**
[occurred during]{.mark} periods of **economic [upswing]{.mark}**. This
finding may provide]{.underline} some [clues on the relationship between
**war and the business cycle**. [Although]{.mark} the [relationship
between]{.mark} the [outbreak]{.mark} of war and the business cycle [is
**unclear**]{.mark}, **the [scale]{.mark} of the war**
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} likely to be [[influenced]{.underline}]{.mark}
by the exact phase of the business cycle in which the belligerents are
engaged. Such a phenomenon might make sense, since [countries in
economic [upturn have **better**]{.mark} **fiscal [capacity]{.mark}**,
making them **more likely [to wage large]{.mark}-scale
[wars]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moreover, such relationship may also stem
from the optimism pointed out by Blainey. While
[[optimism]{.underline}]{.mark} may not directly lead to wars, it [may
have an [impact]{.mark} on **the [choice of rivals]{.mark}**. This is
because [optimism about]{.mark} **national [strength]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **the [outcome]{.mark} of the war** may [drive countries to
choose **stronger rivals**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[result]{.mark}ing
war [is]{.mark} likely to be **far [more massive and
bloody]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Nevertheless, more research is needed to
specifically reveal this relationship.

From this point of view, [it is **not clear** whether there is **a
direct causal relationship** between the outbreak of war and the
business cycle, but the [existence of]{.mark} **periodic economic
[crises]{.mark}** [in capitalist countries renders war **a tool** to
promote expansion]{.mark}ary economic policies]{.underline}. The
economic performance of the war is the expansion of government
expenditure and possession of overseas resources and markets, which is
in some ways consistent with the goal of expansionary fiscal policy.
Therefore, [war may be used by governments as **[a]{.mark} political
[means]{.mark}** [to stimulate the economy]{.mark}]{.underline},
although the relationship between the use of such means and the specific
stages of business cycle remains to be explored.

#### Diversionary wars are small and don't escalate

But [what about military force?]{.underline} To be clear, **[[there is
little cause to speculate]{.mark} that [Trump plans to launch a
full-scale war solely to distract]{.mark} attention]{.underline}**.
**[For one]{.underline}** thing, as president, [[the worst]{.mark}
possible [time to start a major]{.mark} military [campaign is when
you're deeply unpopular]{.mark}. And the [political upside is
shaky]{.mark} at best]{.underline}. [Recent big wars in Afghanistan and
Iraq were politically damaging to]{.underline} George W.
[Bush]{.underline}. [Even victory doesn't guarantee a pay-off,
as]{.underline} George [H. W. Bush discovered when he won
the]{.underline} 1991 [Gulf War]{.underline} and then lost his bid for
reelection in 1992. A crisis may arise where there are real
national-security rationales for fighting, along with potential domestic
gains. Here, the payoff at home would likely enter Trump's calculus, and
even push him over the edge to fight, with the legitimate casus belli
providing a shield of plausible deniability. **[[The most tempting use
of force may be a]{.mark} seemingly [manageable]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
but still dazzling, **[[kinetic operation, like a missile strike or a
raid]{.mark} to kill terrorist leaders.]{.underline}** [[Another
option]{.mark} would be [to escalate a crisis where an **easy win**
seems available]{.mark}: The key is to find the right [enemy]{.mark},
one that's both widely hated and **[too weak to fight
back]{.mark}**.]{.underline} After all, there's a well-established
"rally 'round the flag" effect, where almost any military crisis
temporarily juices the president's approval ratings. In the wake of
Clinton's airstrikes in 1998, one poll found that 68 percent of
Americans approved of his foreign policy. Republican House Speaker Newt
Gingrich said, "it was the right thing to do at the right time."

While I haven\'t had the privilege of divine revelation, I do try to
look at the forces that are in play that have the power to move nations
economically. Two dominant countervailing forces right now are those who
have George Soros nearly in tears \-- who make up the anti-global
revolution \-- and then all the globalists like Soros who are panicking
that their new world order is being shredded accompanied by all the
raging anarchists that Soros can sponsor as his mercenaries. There is
some certainty here: [globalists will not give up after decades
of]{.underline} massaging and [manipulating]{.underline} and cajoling
[the world in their pluralistic, globalist direction and]{.underline} so
[will **wage battles everywhere** they find]{.underline} people or
candidates resisting their agenda. [At the same time, those who are sick
of globalism have risen up in Brexit and]{.underline} with
[Trump]{.underline} as their champion, and are not about to lie back
down. [So, **conflict is certain**]{.underline} for several years to
come. That was an easy prediction for me to make earlier, and we\'re
seeing it play out daily now that Trump is in 0ffice as president.
[Internal conflict tends to **get in the way of commerce**
and]{.underline} so [is likely to have economic impact]{.underline}.
Within this milieu of daily conflict [we have an economic structure in
the US (and]{.underline} similarly [in]{.underline} most of [the rest of
the world) that is so **riddled with flaws** that have not been fixed
(and have]{.underline} even [been made far worse) that it\'s **[collapse
is inevitable]{.mark}**]{.underline} even without conflict knocking up
against it. [A list of economic flaws]{.underline} that are too big not
to fail [[Banks that were too big to fail are now much bigger
than]{.mark}]{.underline} they were in [[2008]{.mark} and
2009.]{.underline} While banks may be a little more solvent at the
moment, [if failure comes, the **risk to the overall economy is far
worse** than]{.underline} in [2008 and 2009. Banksters]{.underline} who
destroyed the global economy were almost all rewarded with much larger
bonuses, instead of thrown in jail, so they [remain at large to wreck
things again and]{.underline} even [are enticed to strike again because
it all worked out]{.underline} so well [the first time;]{.underline} but
[we don\'t know where and at what time their corruption will
cause]{.underline} their [failure]{.underline}. What we do know, is that
corruption drifts that way. [[Bailing out banks
created]{.underline}]{.mark} exactly [[the \"**moral hazard**\"]{.mark}
that]{.underline} many [people warned about in 2009.]{.underline} As a
result, one thing we do know is that **[bailed-out banks continued
their]{.underline}** derivative [**investments** that caused many of the
2008 and 2009 failures.]{.underline} In fact, [they increased their
involvement in this perilous and poorly understood area of
investment]{.underline} to such new heights that the number of
derivatives in 2009 looks like an large city seen from earth-orbiting
altitude \-- a mere spot compared to all that can be seen now. [[Goldman
Sachs,]{.mark} the **most evil of all**]{.underline} the [**companies**
that helped cause the global economic collapse, now has three high-level
positions in the Trump administration]{.underline}, versus the one that
it had in the Obama admin. [It]{.underline}, in essence now **[[oversees
the whole US financial system]{.underline}]{.mark}** \-- the Fed, the
National Economic Council, and the Treasury. Thanks to the revoking of
Glass-Steagall, [Banks are]{.underline} still [allowed to **invest in
risky assets** like stocks]{.underline}, and [the Federal Reserve
has]{.underline} even [talked about investing directly in stocks as its
next recovery plan, even though the revoking of Glass-Steagall played a
major role in setting the US up for the Great Recession.]{.underline}
[[Trump plans to roll back Dodd-Frank]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Glass-Steagall\'s half-hearted replacement). That means [there will be
no correction to this serious economic aberration for a long
time.]{.underline} Because [the Fed can **print infinite amounts of
money**]{.underline} at its own discretion and give it to banks or maybe
even start investing it directly, [there is no legal limit to how much
the Fed and its]{.underline} member [bank\'s can manipulate the stock
market]{.underline} \... so long as the keep overall inflation (which
doesn\'t count stocks) and jobs under control. So, for economic
recovery, [we\'re returning to the old tricks of banking deregulation to
loosen up credit]{.underline}; we\'ve all seen how beautifully banks
policed themselves, as Alan Greenspan assured us they would. Likewise,
[we are returning to trickle-down economics]{.underline}, and are about
to trump it up higher than under Reagan or GW Bush. We\'ve had many
years of trickle-down economics over the past thirty years, and clearly
[it has diminished the middle class and **shifted wealth to the top one
percent** to where our]{.underline} market [economy is]{.underline} now
[weaker because it was a well-off middle class that constituted that
market]{.underline}. We\'ve learned nothing! [The national debt, which
was]{.underline} completely [absurd at \$10,000,000,000,000]{.underline}
by the end of the Bush administration, [has now **doubled to
\$20,000,000,000,000**]{.underline}, thanks to the Obama administration.
[Trump\'s infrastructure stimulus]{.underline} plan [and military
buildup are]{.underline}, so far, [estimated to **add**]{.underline}
somewhere between \$5 trillion and [**\$10 trillion** to that
debt]{.underline} [over a decade]{.underline}. That means we\'ll likely
continue Obama\'s \$1 trillion annual deficit. Thus, [we fully plan
to]{.underline} keep [continue the immoral game of spending]{.underline}
all of [the next generation\'s money to buy the things we need, build up
our military and]{.underline} to [fund our generous welfare]{.underline}
to immigrants and other nations. We\'ve learned nothing! [[Corporate
debt has]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[increased to **stratospheric
levels**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [that debt was]{.underline} a big
part of what was [keeping stock prices rising as companies created
market demand for their own shares by buying them back]{.underline},
which also reduces supply to drive up prices. The stock market, which I
believe is already a bubble, is ballooning in speculation of Trump\'s
grand credit card (not because earnings have greatly improved, for those
calculations look more jury-rigged than ever). [Housing prices are
back]{.underline} up [to the same insane levels they reached in
2007]{.underline} in most of the US, [which could only be supported by
loose terms of credit]{.underline} back then. [The move back up to those
prices has]{.underline} mostly [been accomplished by
resorting]{.underline} again [to]{.underline} [looser]{.underline} terms
of [credit]{.underline}. So, [we\'re back in a housing
bubble]{.underline} because real wages are no better now than they were
then. (We learned nothing!) [Banks continued to issue adjustable-rate
mortgages, which we experienced as]{.underline} being safe when home
values are rising, but [devastating time bombs if home values fall so
that people cannot refinance their way out of them]{.underline} when the
interest increase hits. [Home values have]{.underline} just [started
declining in several key markets]{.underline}, particularly at the top
end, [meaning]{.underline} some of [those adjustable-rate
mortgages]{.underline} bombs [may be **nearing their final ticks**.
Interest]{.underline} on all of that debt (housing, corporate,
government) remains at historically low levels, but [started rising at
a]{.underline}n [historically rapid rate]{.underline} in the last few
months, even without the Fed moving its targets, [due]{.underline} in
part [to anticipation of the financing Trump will]{.underline} have to
[do to carry out his infrastructure plans.]{.underline} That\'s just
domestically. Internationally, [two of [the]{.mark} oldest and [largest
banks in Europe keep]{.mark} [**teetering on the edge of
collapse**.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[All of Italy\'s banks are
**structurally unsound** because they]{.underline} continue to [carry
the bad debt from the 2008-2009 financial collapse]{.underline} because
they cannot afford to write it off. [Greece is still walking the fine
edge of bankruptcy. Spain, Portugal and Ireland look
marginal]{.underline} at best. Trends determine ends [These are
all]{.underline} problems that are [**major trends**. [They
are]{.mark}]{.underline} also all [**[structural economic
flaws]{.mark}** that existed prior to 2007]{.underline} and that
[contributed to the economic collapse]{.underline} that started in 2007
[and became known]{.underline} by 2008 [as the Great Recession.
Nothing]{.underline} (or, at best, very little) [has been done about
them]{.underline}. Nothing is even being talked about being done about
them in any serious way. Therefore, [nothing is going to be done about
them]{.underline}. In fact, all of these flaws are worse today than they
were in 2008! That means [they will continue to grow until they **erupt
in turmoil** again]{.underline}. Exactly when I\'m not as certain
because the election changed things. [Trumps stimulus plans]{.underline}
on the national credit are so huge they [are bound to
create]{.underline} some [temporary lift]{.underline}, but Trump and his
cabinetful of bankster-barons are not going to be able to stop these
numerous trends from crushing us. For one thing, [Trump has expressed no
plans to solve]{.underline} any of [these overwhelming structural
flaws]{.underline} that are trending against us, some of which are past
solving (like the national debt). It is questionable he and his cabinet
even believe they are important. Ultimately, [his short-term stimulus
will make]{.underline} some of the items on [this list worse in the long
term]{.underline}. [Huge tax breaks for the rich]{.underline} will give
some temporary economic boost if they ever make it through congress, but
they [will]{.underline} also [create **more economic
disparity**]{.underline} as the cost. [That means **more political
conflict** as the gap between the rich and the poor widens more
quickly]{.underline} than we\'ve ever seen before. [The
boost]{.underline}, if it happens, [will]{.underline} also [come at the
cost of much more national debt]{.underline}. So, [the **longterm
economic damage will be significant**]{.underline} as it has been after
all previous periods of trickle-down economics, [marching us toward more
debt and decline]{.underline}. The cabinetful of [bankster-barons will
not]{.underline} likely [start putting banksters in jail]{.underline}.
They will even less likely break up banks that are too big to fail. They
will not put the Fed out of business or the nation back onto the gold
standard. They will not likely put Hillary in jail. None of that is
going to happen. Or, at least, very little of it. As it turns out, the
first major wave of the Epocalypse that I predicted for 2016 turned out
to be political \-- a revolt against the establishment \-- rather than
economic. Now, the counter-revolution has begun as liberals start
fighting back. While I certainly don\'t want the non-globalists to back
down, you can be certain the globalist establishment isn\'t about to
back down either. [Efforts will intensify on both sides as the
pressures]{.underline} above [continue to build unabated, making 2017 a
year of intensifying battles while **the economic time bomb keeps
ticking away** because no one is paying attention to these structural

Collapse." International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, vol. 19,

[In a more and more globalized world we have created **unprecedented
connectivity**]{.underline}, mainly by striving for better business
opportunities. [But with such a strong global connectivity, the
**risks** associated have]{.underline} [**also changed**:
formerly]{.underline} **[local]{.underline}** [issues can now
have]{.underline} [**global impact**, and systems are often]{.underline}
[**too complex to fully understand their interdependencies**. In
addition, the]{.underline} **[speed of change]{.underline}** [is
increasing in many sectors of society and [the
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. [So we are building a future world with
more and more]{.underline} **[interdependencies]{.underline}** [of which
we **understand less and less**, and this process
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[accelerating]{.mark}
sharply]{.underline}**. [This means that we are mixing together the
**typical ingredients for an upcoming crash**, which]{.underline} in the
worst case [could mean the]{.underline} **[collapse of society as we
know it]{.underline}**. To avoid such a scenario, a coordinated effort
of public authorities, civil society, industry, and academia will be
required. 1. Introduction Predictions about the collapse of society are
probably as old as society itself, but only in the last decades has
mankind managed to approach -- and sometimes even overstep -- the
planetary boundaries \[1,2\] in several dimensions, often irreversibly.
The scientific approach of modeling human societies on the basis
predator (mankind) and prey (planetary resources) \[3\], also points to
the possibility of a large-scale collapse. We often reassure ourselves
by noting that all the models used are based on assumptions, that they
have many uncertainties, that they only approximate our highly complex
reality. Critical analyses of the limits of modeling seem to confirm
this \[4\], and we know that technical models clearly do not take into
account our human ingenuity at getting ourselves out of difficulties --
but is this reassurance reasonable? Even the assumption that we can
define our own future within the planetary boundaries is questioned by
critical voices like Russell \[5\], warning us against the belief in
unlimited growth of exponential curves, and drawing drastic conclusions
about the future of mankind. Nevertheless, our economic strategies seem
to assume continuously greater efficiency in the future and even faster
economic growth with literally no limit. This method of [forecasting
future development by extrapolation from the past is]{.underline}
**[risky]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} **[two different
ways]{.underline}**. [Firstly, it does not respect]{.underline}
**[natural limits]{.underline}** [to growth]{.underline}. [These may
arise from the limited]{.underline} **[availability of
resources]{.underline}**, [or from]{.underline} **[physical
boundaries]{.underline}** [which seemed]{.underline} [**far away in the
past**, but now have **come into reach**]{.underline}. [A good example
for the latter is **Moore\'s law**]{.underline} \[6\], predicting in
1965 a doubling of the maximum number of transistors in integrated
circuits every 12 months. This "law", adjusted to 24 months in 1975 and
confirmed as 'not going to stop soon' in 1995 \[7,8\], remained valid
for some 50 years, but it [is]{.underline} [now]{.underline}
**[[at]{.mark} or near its [limits]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[9\],
[[imposed by]{.underline}]{.mark} several [paradigms of]{.underline}
**[[fundamental physics]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although completely new
approaches might one day circumvent some of these limits \[10\],
Moore\'s law simply cannot remain valid for another 50 years for
integrated circuits as we currently know them. [Secondly, a prediction
based solely on experience from the past does not foresee]{.underline}
**[unexpected]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[potentially disruptive
events]{.underline}**. The **[[Fukushima]{.underline}]{.mark}** nuclear
disaster of 2011 [and [the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[global [financial
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}** of 2007--08 are [prominent examples of
sudden events **[end]{.mark}ing high-flying [hopes]{.mark} for
controlled risk**]{.underline} [in **energy supply**]{.underline} [or
ever-increasing **economic profits**]{.underline}, respectively.
[Looking at the large number of fascinating growth stories from sources
like digital industries, Chinese GDP, or investment banking profits, we
tend to forget about the fate of the **stars from the
past**]{.underline} [when they reached their limits: US automotive
industries, Canadian and European cell phone producers or Japanese
efficiency champions all have in common that they **could not
maintain**]{.underline} [their excellent growth rates for eternity. We
need to pay attention to the limits of growth very carefully when
looking at the long-term resilience of our global society.]{.underline}
2. Objectives We will show that globalization and the digital revolution
have led to more interdependencies, higher complexity and rapid
acceleration of change in most sectors of our societies and economies.
For this reason, the long-term resilience of a nation, a region or an
industry cannot be considered any more as a confined matter that has
little to do with the global environment. We will demonstrate by several
examples from the recent years that interconnection, complexity and
acceleration thereof as ingredients of globalization and digitization
have increased the risk of major shocks, propagating not only inside but
also across individual sectors, and to society as a whole. We will show
that there are strategies to limit this risk but also show that these
strategies could not have been implemented successfully so far in our
current economically driven environment. During the discussion we will
look at two important concepts which are relevant to resilience, but are
not at the center of the attention of our growth-oriented efforts today:
fairness, which is important to avoid tensions within societies, and
risk transfer, which in many examples seems to flow from the
better-informed expert stakeholders to the less-informed parts of our
society. We make a number of suggestions as to how science can support
policy decisions in a highly complex world. We also propose a radically
different pattern of business incentives, aimed at taking some steps
towards improving fairness, at decoupling economic growth from
consumption and above all at making risk-taking at someone else\'s
expense less attractive. 3. Methods Although there is abundant
literature about resilience, sustainability and risk, there are very few
scientific discussions of hyper-complex issues spanning multiple sectors
of our societies, policies and economies. The notion of so-called
post-normal science, introduced by Funtowicz and Ravetz \[11\], is a
step in the direction of understanding complex systems at the borderline
between science and policy, but it only gives theoretical backing rather
than direct guidance. More on the practical side, Taleb \[12\] provides
many important examples, including valuable considerations on the human
inability to assess risks correctly in complex environments. The issue
of the human mind often being misled is also underlined by Spiegelhalter
\[13\], showcasing several disruptive events with economic or health
impact. Because resilience and sustainability are typically discussed in
communities focused on the business perspective (such as re-insurance
companies), at the national level (governments), or in a particular
community (e.g. the civil protection community), there is no obvious
forum for a broader scale discussion at supranational level, connecting
economic, political and societal dimensions. We started such a dialog on
the work of the European Commission\'s Joint Research Centre (JRC), when
around 2012 we realized that the typical crisis management activities
are related to civil protection, but the predominant crisis of these
years was the financial crisis, in which the JRC was performing
completely different activities such as modeling the probabilities of
bank failure or assessing the trends and issues in public finances of
Eurozone Member States. From the idea of resilience cutting across
sectors and being relevant in many places, we identified many sectors in
society, policy and economy where resilience matters, and documented
them in an overview report \[14\]. In a series of related workshops and
conferences we discussed the facets of resilience with the stakeholder
community and gathered valuable insights. In a 2014 workshop on
\'Thinking the impossible\' at the JRC in Ispra, Italy, we looked at
risks that sound highly unlikely but could be devastating. At the Global
Risk Forum 2014 in Davos we ran a dedicated session on risks across
sectors of society. At the European Climate Foundation in Brussels early
2015 we followed up on the matter, and at a big conference of the
European Commission in September 2015 (also in Brussels) we had a
plenary presentation on resilience, complexity and risk across sectors
of society. Finally, in joint session of the International Council of
Science (ICSU) and the JRC at the World Science Forum of November 2015
in Budapest we discussed resilience in a changing world. The findings
and conclusions of these workshops and conferences are presented in this
article. 4. Results 4.1. Increased dependencies across sectors [Crises
can]{.underline} [**spread globally**, and in our modern world they can
easily also impact business sectors that at **first
glance**]{.underline} **[do not seem exposed]{.underline}**. In the
following section we will show examples of how [effects can]{.underline}
**[hop]{.underline}** [from the]{.underline} **[digital
world]{.underline}** [into]{.underline} the **[finance]{.underline}**
sector, [from finance to]{.underline} **[government]{.underline}**, [on
to]{.underline} **[geopolitics]{.underline}**, [to]{.underline}
**[energy]{.underline}** [and finally to]{.underline} **[societal
stability]{.underline}**. [The related **damage** in each hop amounts to
several **billions**. Although the examples listed are not connected, in
the future we might see **cross-sector cascading effects**]{.underline}.
4.1.1. From digital to finance [In the digital world, **computer
viruses**]{.underline} [can cause damages in the millions]{.underline},
but these damages are usually distributed over a very large number of
users and businesses. [Other digital risks strike more
centrally:]{.underline} [**[high-speed trading]{.mark} algorithms**,
[mak]{.mark}ing autonomous decisions at the stock [exchanges in
milliseconds, caused]{.mark} the so-called]{.underline} **[[flash
crashes]{.underline}]{.mark}** [at the New York Stock exchange in 2010
and at the Singapore stock exchange in October 2013, with the latter
reportedly wiping out]{.underline} **[6.9bn USD]{.underline}** \[15\].
[It took more than four months to analyze the reasons behind the 15-min
New York crash, and the report by the US authorities came to the
conclusion that there was]{.underline} **[[no]{.mark} clearly
[identifiable]{.mark} root [cause]{.mark}]{.underline}** [that [sparked
the crash]{.mark}. They considered the events \'an important reminder of
the]{.underline} **[inter-connectedness of our derivatives and
securities markets\']{.underline}** [and stated that they \'clearly
demonstrate the **importance of data**]{.underline} [in today\'s world
of fully-automated trading strategies and systems\']{.underline}\[16\].
[Although many stocks]{.underline} **[rebounded]{.underline}** [right
after the dip, the reaction of software algorithms could **easily have
ruined companies**]{.underline}, and in Singapore some stocks lost 87%
of their value. Safeguards were consequently installed in the systems of
the stock exchanges, but other [unpleasant and new surprises might come
from different directions: **high-frequency trading**, for instance, can
be vulnerable to the effects of]{.underline} **[[solar
storms]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[17\], but not all financial institutions
are aware of these very indirect effects: originating on the surface of
the sun, solar outbreaks can create electromagnetic disturbances [strong
enough to [take out]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[GPS]{.underline}]{.mark}** signal, [which is widely used for **time
synchronization** in financial trading.]{.underline} 4.1.2. Financial to
economic After the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, a major shock
went through the US banking system. Not only the US housing market had
gone sour, but credit default swaps had been spread all over the globe
-- and a cascade of repackaged and distributed risk started, jumping the
Atlantic Ocean easily and hitting EU banks. Some of these were hit so
hard that they had to be bailed out by their governments, so the risk
continued in the governments. Some EU governments needed central
support, and the EU used the opportunity to overhaul its financial
system. Nevertheless, the governments of eleven EU Member States
resigned or were ousted over the crisis, some of them several times
(Latvia and the Czech Republic in 2009, Ireland, Portugal, Greece, Italy
and Spain, in 2011, Romania, the Netherlands, and Italy again in 2012,
Slovenia in 2013, Italy a third time and France in 2014 and Portugal in
2015). [The link between the US banking sector and EU government
stability is obvious in hindsight, but very few if any observers had
noted it before 2007. More obvious is the link from]{.underline}
**[government to geopolitics]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline} **[Arab
Spring]{.underline}** [gave rise to unstructured power relations and
laid the ground for **extremism and radicalism**]{.underline}.
**[Ukraine\'s]{.underline}** [attempt to sign an association agreement
with the EU led to massive demonstrations and a **regional political
crisis**, including]{.underline} a **[(civil) war]{.underline}**. [The
civil war in]{.underline} **[Syria]{.underline}**, ongoing since more
than five years, [has destroyed stability and economy in the region. And
we recently saw in the]{.underline} **[gas supply]{.underline}**
[discussions between Russia, Ukraine and the EU that geopolitics **links
to energy**. It took a well-prepared last-minute effort to conclude a
gas supply deal, which finally was agreed only shortly before winter,
during the last days of October 2014.]{.underline} 4.1.3. Energy to
society [Energy is at the core of the]{.underline} **[economic
development]{.underline}** [of many countries]{.underline}, [and
the]{.underline} power **[grid]{.underline}** [has become
an]{.underline} **[indispensable critical infrastructure]{.underline}**.
A fictional but well-researched scenario on what the world would look
like after a widespread collapse of the power grid is available in the
book by Elsberg \[18\]. Elsberg considers an IT-based collapse, but that
is not the only hazard to the power grid: several reports and studies on
severe space weather suggest that this too could cause major damage, up
to USD 2.6 trillion in the first year in the US alone \[19,20\]. In
addition, energy has an obvious relation to climate policies, to the
real economy and even to digital processes: [modern **computing
centers**]{.underline} [depend on]{.underline} **[energy]{.underline}**
availability, [and new digital concepts like the
**blockchain**]{.underline} \[21\] [of]{.underline} the
**[bitcoin]{.underline}** currency [even exploit the obstacle of not
being able to calculate highly complex matters without consuming
significant energy]{.underline} \[22\]. [There are numerous other
examples where sectors that were reasonably independent in the past are
now **coupled across the globe**]{.underline}. **[E. coli]{.underline}**
contaminated [food traveled]{.underline} **[all across
Europe]{.underline}**. **[Pandemics]{.underline}** [like]{.underline}
**[[SARS]{.underline}]{.mark}** [or]{.underline} **[bird
[flu]{.mark}]{.underline}** [spread through intercontinental travelers.
**[Ebola]{.mark}** cases]{.underline} [were spread by infected
passengers from Africa to Europe and to the US]{.underline}; the disease
was only contained through a major international initiative. [All these
examples show clearly that not only has the interrelation between
sectors increased, but also the]{.underline} **[complexity of
interdependencies]{.underline}** [in financial markets, of energy grids,
of high-speed trading algorithms, of the food chains, of environmental
changes and of global travel has]{.underline} [**grown hugely**. Indeed,
in many cases we **only perceive these interdependencies after a major
perturbation**]{.underline}, and there is no agreement on what body or
institution has the responsibility for identifying, monitoring, and
controlling the risks created. The context of change is formally given a
global perspective by the Global Risks Report 2016\[23\], which draws
attention to ways global risks could evolve and interact in the next
decade. The top five global risks in terms of likelihood are ranked to
be: 1. large-scale involuntary migration; 2. extreme weather events; 3.
failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; 4. interstate
conflict with regional consequences; and 5. major natural catastrophes.
The report\'s Global Risks Interconnectedness Map 2016 shows strong
interconnections across sectors, e.g. between environmental and societal
risks (failure on climate change and water crises), but also across
societal, geopolitical and economic risks (with strong links from state
collapse to migration and between social instability and unemployment).
4.2. Increased complexity of systems and processes The financial crisis
has brought to our attention that the lending relations in the
interbanking market have become highly complex \[24\], which decreases
systemic resilience. Haldane and May \[25\] identify modularity as a key
feature for the topology of a stable financial system, as it helps limit
contagion. Typically, one would expect that a good connectivity in
financial networks allows for a sound distribution of risk, but
Battiston et al. \[26\] have shown that in the presence of a financial
accelerator (which we clearly had in the financial crisis, where the
robustness of an entity was strongly assessed on the basis of its past
trend) this only holds until a certain threshold is reached. Over the
threshold, additional connectivity turns counterproductive and creates a
pernicious feedback loop, increasing individual and systemic risk. The
situation during the financial crisis was even worse than that depicted
by the theoretical approaches. Little was known about the real
connectivity in the banking system. Rumors about new candidates for
bankruptcy were traveling fast, and the biggest unanswered question
about the distribution of debt was literally: \'Where is the money?\' In
addition, banks were rushing to pass on questionable debt for as long as
it was still possible, creating a dynamism which could not be controlled
easily. The failure to understand the complexity of the market is
perhaps depicted most prominently by the fact that the German KfW Bank
transferred 320 million Euros to Lehman on Monday, September 15th, 2008,
the very day Lehman collapsed. Luckily for the KfW, the majority of the
sum was recovered later \[27\]. But the financial markets are just one
example of a sector that has become so complex that we simply do not
understand it anymore. The fact that we have also lost track of the
details of our food chain became obvious when in 2011 the European E.
coli bacteria outbreak caused several fatalities in Germany and beyond,
and a frantic search for the origin started. Due to the precautionary
principle, also suspect traces had to be addressed, resulting in Spanish
cucumbers being wrongly identified as contaminated with E. coli. This
led to reported weekly Spanish losses of 200 million Euros \[28\] due to
the decline in consumer trust, whereas finally bean sprouts of
completely different origin were identified as the root cause for the E.
coli outbreak, although even this was contested. The issue showed how
little we know about the origin and stopovers of our food. Another less
damaging but unexpected complexity could be observed after the Fukushima
nuclear disaster, when Ford Motors in the US and other international car
makers could no longer produce models in a particular metallized black
\[29\] due to a shortage in the Xirallic® pigment, produced by Merck
plant near Fukushima, which had been affected by the catastrophe. (Note
that strong impact from Fukushima also arrived on the other side of the
planet, when the German government issued its Energiewende policy to
abandon nuclear power as a consequence of the disaster in Japan.) This
example shows that it is not only in the food sector that the complexity
of supply chains has grown beyond our comprehension. [[The]{.mark} power
[grid]{.mark} is another infrastructure which has become **so
complex**]{.underline} [that [we **do not**]{.mark} **fully
[understand]{.mark} it [anymore]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On 4 November
2006, the cruise ship Norwegian Pearl was planned to make its way on the
German river Ems to the North Sea, requiring a shutdown of a 380 kV
power line across the river for safety reasons. Although a routine
operation, this shutdown resulted in cascading effects all across
Europe, leaving an estimated 15 million households in Germany, France,
Italy, Belgium, Spain, and Portugal without power for more than an hour
\[30\]. These examples show that our technologically driven world has
developed structures and processes that cannot be fully understood or
easily modeled anymore. Even if we had the time to carefully analyze
this, it would not be very helpful: reality is moving on, and complexity
is added on a daily basis. In a competitive world with tightly fought
margins we cannot expect the complex processes to be stable over time.
The opposite is true: the speed of change is even increasing in many
domains. 4.3. Acceleration of interconnectedness and complexity The
exponential growth of Moore\'s law has boosted performance and minimized
the size of microelectronics. The availability of ever smaller and more
powerful digital technologies has also accelerated other areas such as
climate modeling, agriculture, industry automation, material sciences,
genetics, economic assessment, finance, transport, construction and many
other sectors. In addition, modern information technology has created a
wealth of business opportunities for the digital economy. Smartphones
put the information of the internet at our fingertips, social networks
arose, satellite navigation systems helped with orientation and timing,
digital imaging and new sensors gave us a better picture of the world,
and all of these results can be joined into what we call big data. In
December 2015 the international science community, Science
International, published a joint statement, on Open Data in a Big Data
World: An international accord\[31\]. They identified the opportunities
and challenges of the data revolution as today\'s predominant issue for
global science policy and proposed some fundamental principles, noting
that the scientific community has a distinctive voice. The acceleration
of all of these sectors has also changed many business models, which has
two negative consequences for the resilience of modern society. Firstly,
there is a stronger dependency of almost all of the processes of our
daily life on very few players, and secondly -- though associated to the
first effect -- we can observe a more and more uneven distribution of
profits, leading to tensions in societies. Dependency has been created
by new concepts such as Information as a Service (IaaS) or Software as a
Service (SaaS), binding customers to suppliers in a far stronger way
than the traditional model of producing and selling. Ten years ago we
would buy a CD and own it, whereas today we need to sign up to music
platforms which provide us with the desired content -- and monitor our
behavior continuously. The associated business models are pushing into
other sectors of industry. Traditional companies in the automotive
sector have to face competition from IT companies developing autonomous
driving, thereby harvesting even more data. E-books are so convenient
that hardcover and paperback revenues are sharply declining, non-digital
photography has almost disappeared and smart phone apps are replacing
travel agencies and taxi companies. This digital acceleration might be
creating more choices for the customer, but comes at the price of
dependency on very few digital players. In addition to this dependency,
which is detrimental to resilience, there is a mid-term issue with
wealth distribution: the agreed measure for macroeconomic growth is
still GDP, which does not contain any fairness component. So we are
striving for economic growth, sometimes also for inclusive growth, but
not necessarily for a fair distribution of growth. An example
illustrates the differences: from 2007--2015, a period covering the
financial crisis, the OECD countries on average experienced moderate
growth in terms of GDP \[32\], but the general aggregate is not telling
a lot. The GDP per capita of different countries developed quite
differently, and in 2015 Germany and Greece were at 107.65% and 76.75%
of their 2007 values, respectively. This created significant political
tensions, and is not expressed in monitoring the aggregate OECD total
(which is 106.45%). But the problem also exists at national level: the
majority of EU households might not agree on having experienced any
economic growth since 2007, but would rather recall austerity measures,
income cuts, and tax increases. The growth measured must therefore have
arrived in other places -- but we do not have detailed, up-to-date
statistics on this. Some evidence originates from a study \[33\] of the
European Central Bank (ECB) in 2013, comparing the mean and the median
values of household wealth in the Eurozone and coming to the conclusion
that fairness has suffered. Germany\'s households, for example, are on
average (mean) comparably well-off, but the difference between the mean
household wealth and the median one is the largest in Europe, indicating
significant unfairness in the detailed distribution. A very clear
analysis of the ECB study can be found in \[34\]. In addition to
potential tensions in society, the risky business models leading to
uneven distribution are undermining resilience even further. We were
reminded during the financial crisis that our modern world is targeted
at short-term profit, possibly at the expense of the system, and that
governments have to intervene if society is not to end up paying the
price of excessive risk taking by comparably few market players.. This
strategy of leaving behind the risk for the bank (or afterwards for the
government and for society) should have been known well since February
1995, when Barings Bank, the oldest UK merchant bank, was brought down
by a single rogue trader \[35\]. But in a fierce global competition
every penny counts, and we cannot expect our job-creating entrepreneurs
to give way to competitors for fairness\'s sake. Production lines of
companies are transferred for profitability reasons from Central Europe
to Eastern Europe, later to China and from there to Vietnam. Domestic
jobs are lost and costs are being saved, while dependencies rise and
unfairness increases. So a certain share of the digital revolution may
just be a silent conversion of thousands of jobs into an enormous cash
flow towards the few big digital shareholders. The evolution of wealth
distribution in the US is very telling, and the perceived rule of
billionaires has even been exploited with some success by Bernie Sanders
in his 2016 US presidential candidature campaign for the Democrats.
Europe also needs to monitor its trends very carefully. The situation of
many young Greek graduates without a job, in combination with loopholes
for the wealthy in the national tax regime (or its enforcement) has
already created massive tensions, led to government changes and to
discussions with EU partners, put pressure on EU solidarity and weakened
EU resilience during the financial crisis. 5. Discussion 5.1. Current
situation When analyzing the resilience of our modern and complex
society, we start from the UNISDR Terminology on Disaster Risk Reduction
\[36\], defining resilience as \'The ability of a system, community or
society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate to and recover
from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner, including
through the preservation and restoration of its essential basic
structures and functions.\' The United Nations' definition has an
important addendum, expressed by the following note: \'Resilience means
the ability to "resile from" or "spring back from" a shock. The
resilience of a community in respect to potential hazard events is
determined by the degree to which the community has the necessary
resources and is capable of organizing itself both prior to and during
times of need\'. This notion of springing back from a shock is nicely
expressed as \'Why things bounce back\' by Zolli and Healy \[37\], who
formally define resilience as \'the capacity of a system, enterprise, or
a person to maintain its core purpose and integrity in the face of
dramatically changed circumstances\'. For a resilience assessment we
therefore need to understand both the change we are exposed to and our
capability to cope with it. Are we already living in dramatically
changed circumstances, are dramatic changes just ahead of us, or will
there be a dramatic change only at a more distant point in the future?
Comparing the world of today with the world in the late 1980s, we can
see huge differences, e.g. in globalization and in digitization, but
there are also many areas that have remained comparably stable, such as
peace in Central Europe, the economically strong position of the US, the
mechanisms of the United Nations, or the simple fact that the majority
of our cars still run on four wheels and are fueled by hydrocarbons.
Dramatic changes there have been, but often not arriving with a big
bang, but silently inserting themselves into our daily lives (e.g. the
internet). The process is continuing and accelerating. Our capacity to
\'bounce back\' -- or more formally to cope with dramatic change -- is
also difficult to assess. There is no formally agreed measure for
resilience that could serve as a benchmark, but we have created powerful
political processes to cope with change globally, such as the
Sustainable Development Goals \[38\], the Paris Climate Agreement
\[39\], or the global Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction
2015--2030 \[40\]. The latter includes in its Priorities for Disaster
Risk Reduction, the statement \'Enhancing disaster preparedness for
effective response, and to 'Build Back Better' in recovery,
rehabilitation and reconstruction\'. The Sendai Conference included a
session on Disaster Risk in the Financial System which concluded that,
by 2020, 1-in-100 and 1-in-20 risk analyses should be developed to
enable the understanding of levels of resilience across all capital and
support the adoption of standards by global regulators. These
international agreements were all made in 2015 but it is notable that
all of these instruments and procedures were the culmination of decades
of work. The Paris agreement (called COP21 because it was signed at the
21st annual meeting of the Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC) was
preceded by the Kyoto \[41\] climate agreement of 1997 and its Doha
amendment \[42\] of 2012. The Sendai Framework was preceded by the 2005
Hyogo Framework for Action \[43\]. The sustainable development goals
were preceded by the original Millennium Development Goals \[44\] of
2000. Altogether, the international community has been working on
resilience for at least 20 years in quite a determined way.
Nevertheless, while global agreements on resilience and sustainability
have been concluded over the last 20 years, the exploitation of
resources has continued, and our remaining planetary reserve has been
depleted more and more. Significant economic development took place and
growth was achieved in many regions of the world, including places like
China, Brazil, India and South Africa, the OPEC countries, Southeast
Asia, but also in Europe, Australia and in North America. However, much
of this growth was accompanied by massive exploitation of natural
resources, often associated with major catastrophes. Offshore drilling
created disasters like the Deepwater Horizon incident with an estimated
settlement of approximately \$7.8bn \[45\]. Massive irrigation caused a
significant loss of natural water reservoirs and dried out the Aral Sea
\[46\], and biodiversity is decreasing at a speed that made Chapin et
al. \[47\] request the establishment of a new international body to
assess changes in biodiversity already in 2000. Our complex technology
has created nuclear incidents with global impact, such as the Fukushima
meltdown in 2011. Even our technological progress in successfully
exploring space has left so much space debris behind that it will
jeopardize the success of future missions, and Hall states in
\[48\]\'... the space community is realizing that the failure to solve
the problem would be disastrous.\'. The role of media in these changes
is complex, but important. On the one hand the mass media, often powered
by an explicit political agenda, can choose to sensationalise some
aspects of global risks while concealing others, thereby aggravating the
problem and making it more difficult for society to find solutions; on
the other hand the media -- especially modern social media -- can create
awareness and encourage solutions. In modern democracies there should be
no compromise with the principles of free speech, even where the effect
may be destructive; but responsible media leaders, journalists and other
commentators can be encouraged to understand the risks and help towards
mitigating them. Other important factors are known but cannot be
reliably predicted: the geopolitical power balance, the strength of the
influence of supranational organizations and institutions, or the power
of the civil society play an important role when assessing the risk of
societal collapse. The authors acknowledge that these factors -- as well
as other drivers such as cultural, religious or historical developments
-- should be considered in a comprehensive assessment but go beyond the
scope of this article. 5.2. Key questions Starting from the above
definitions, the key questions when looking at the resilience of our
current societies are (i) how much flexibility do we have left, and (ii)
how can we carry on from today. It seems particularly with regards to
global energy needs that whatever coping capacity is left on our planet
(e.g. shale gas or nuclear fusion energy) will either be exhausted very
soon or contribute to a further acceleration of the negative effects.
Therefore, unless we can decouple growth from the use of resources, we
are heading for, at worst, a crash, or at best an unpleasant downward
spiral, even though currently the slope is still pointing up. Ehrlich
\[49\] concludes that our modern society has a different risk of
collapse than former societies which collapsed locally or regionally
only. He claims that complex, multi-level systems may be better able to
cope with complex, multi-level problems, but we fear that this statement
only holds up to a point where the complexity of systems itself becomes
an additional risk. Carrying on from today is even more difficult. Our
short-term thinking often limits our vision to the next few years, and
although we could still change course, we rather exercise ourselves in
denial and promises of continuous and never-ending growth, missing the
point that even the growth we are experiencing today is more and more
unfair and therefore already eroding our social solidarity and, as a
consequence, our resilience. Diamond \[50\] has analyzed the differences
between today\'s dangers and the dangers that past societies faced, and
identified twelve main problems specific to the world of today,
including inequality. He also researched why many of the formerly ruling
societies failed to recognize that big problems were looming up before
they fell, and concludes that this reflex of denial has not changed over
the centuries. We enjoy the speed and acceleration -- but can we
distinguish between the thrust of the engine and the free fall as we go
over the cliff? Currently we simply try to outperform each other on
speed, and leave it at that. The interconnectedness, complexity and
acceleration of our modern society have brought us to the limits of
exponential growth and have simultaneously exhausted the resources of
the planet in several dimensions, weakening our resilience. To
capitalize on what is left of it, a major rethink in society is
required. In a fierce global competition such reconsideration will
clearly not happen on its own, but needs to be accomplished by the right
incentives to avoid unnecessary interconnectedness, reduce systemic
complexity and slow down an acceleration that cannot be maintained
forever anyway. But how can we achieve this? Key elements for
accomplishing this challenge will be decoupling growth from consumption,
introducing more fairness into the system and identifying and mastering
risk. Especially this last requires a better understanding of risk in
our complex systems, especially if there is a risk of major systemic
failure. In addition, we need to prevent the transfer of systemic risk
to less knowledgeable stakeholders (the general public, the taxpayer,
etc.) not connected with the original transaction in which the risk was
created. 5.3. Suggestions for a way ahead We therefore suggest three
initiatives to lay the ground for an economy and society aiming at
sustainable wealth rather than chasing for unrealistic never-ending
growth, turning from a continued depletion of resources to a resilient
continuum. The initiatives are not meant to suffocate or kill the
economy but to move it rapidly from a destructive and short-term mode to
a long-term healthy equilibrium. This might sound ambitious, and might
be perceived as threatening by the homo economicus of our modern days,
but any profit-oriented activity has long had to consider political side
constraints, and moving the incentives to different objectives will only
regulate markets in the desired direction, not abolish them or move to
socialism. History shows that with the right incentives a single human
generation is sufficient not only to turn the mindset of modern society
but also to create a highly competitive technology position in the
markets. Between 1970 and 2000, environmental thinking in Europe and in
the US was fostered by regulators, civil society and industry
altogether, and created new markets and green growth to the benefit of
nature. Another example, still ongoing, is the global effort on
CO2-reduction and climate change agreements, which started roughly 15
years ago and has made significant progress with the COP21 agreement of
2015. Science will have to play an important role in this respect, and a
number of international initiatives with scientific involvement have
already been started in the related area of sustainability. The
International Council for Science (ICSU), UN agency partners and other
non-governmental organizations including the International Social
Sciences Council, Sustainable Development Solutions Network and Science
and Technology in Society Forum, with the World Business Council for
Sustainable Development (WBCSD) as an observer, have created a new
global research program Future Earth: Research for Global
Sustainability\[51\]. The goal is to provide the knowledge required for
societies in the world to face risks posed by global environmental
change and to seize opportunities in a transition to global
sustainability. The Integrated Research on Disaster Risk Programme
(IRDR) \[52\] (focusing on \'natural\' hazards) is another approach to
research on disaster risk through an international, multidisciplinary
(natural, health, engineering and social sciences) collaborative
programme. The Program has created IRDR International Centres of
Excellence such as one on Vulnerability and Resilience Metrics and
another on Disaster Resilient Homes, Buildings and Public
Infrastructure. Another newly-started research programme, recognizing
the importance of the urban scene and health is Urban Health and
Wellbeing\[53\], which is an interdisciplinary research effort whose
overall aim is to generate policy-relevant knowledge that will improve
health status, reduce health inequalities and enhance the well-being of
urban dwellers. It will focus on systems approaches to address the
complexity of urban issues and their influence on health. The
International Council for Science is working with UN agencies to bring
together the science from these three international research programs in
an integrated way to provide advice to the Climate Convention, the
Sendai Agreement, the Sustainable Development Goals and other
international issues. [The next **thirty years**]{.underline} [should
be]{.underline} **[sufficient time]{.underline}** [to instill a
sustainability and resilience philosophy into policies, civil society
and the economy -- **turning from unfair growth**]{.underline} to
healthy growth. The start of any such initiative could even bring direct
economic benefits: The World Business Council for Sustainable
Development identified significant business opportunities in
sustainability, and underlines the importance of being first in the
green race \[54\], and first business models in creating a sustainable
future have already emerged \[55\]. This means we have arrived at a
point where not acting might make us fall behind. With the right
political, economic and societal incentives, resilience will pay off,
whereby it will no longer be economically viable to go for extreme risks
(as the consequences could not be passed on to others). The following
three suggestions by the authors are meant to support a sustainable and
resilient society, and are derived from the analysis above: (1) Cut down
interdependencies by putting incentives to avoid business models which
-- create unnecessary global interdependencies, -- do not create local
jobs (or no jobs at all), -- force people to move, -- limit customer
choices and flexibility without a need, -- exploit the weakest parts of
society. (2) Reduce complexity by putting incentives to avoid business
models which -- create unnecessarily complex procedures, -- transfer
risk into remote places, to the taxpayer, or to less knowledgeable
parties -- gamble on rights not being enforceable, -- exploit taxation
loopholes or taxation enforcement weaknesses. (3) Stop the acceleration
of interconnectivity and complexity by putting strong economic
incentives for simple business models creating local or community
benefit. Research can make a major contribution to setting the right
incentives, as nowadays many traditional concepts are not fit for
purpose, and new ways of measuring resilience, fairness and
sustainability need to be established. We therefore suggest developing a
scientifically solid measure for fair GDP (FGDP) as an internationally
acknowledged benchmark for growth to avoid extreme inequality and
tension in societies. In addition, initiatives to measure resilience of
societies in their multidimensional facets, trying to identify drivers
of fragility as well as tipping points for slowly increasing
instability, are recommended. 6. Conclusion [The world has come to an
unprecedented status of [interconnectedness]{.mark} and complexity, both
growing at an enormous speed, and it **[urgently requires]{.mark} a
[transition from short-term thinking to sustainable
resilience]{.mark}**. Such a change needs to be [triggered by]{.mark}
the right political, **[economic]{.mark}** and societal
**[incentives]{.mark}**. There are]{.underline} [**clear ways ahead**,
but they]{.underline} need to be accompanied by organized support from
the stakeholder groups involved. It [will require a]{.underline} [joint
effort of public authorities, civil society, industry, and academia to
lead the global transition towards a resilient society, offering fair
long-term growth in a **healthy and sustainable societal
equilibrium**.]{.underline}

Carbon Emissions -- Is Growth Compatible with the Paris Agreement?
Unlike with resource use, there is a steady long-term trend toward
relative decoupling of GDP from carbon emissions, and we know that
absolute reductions in carbon emissions are possible to achieve. When it
comes to climate change, however, [the objective is not simply to reduce
emissions]{.underline} (a matter of flows), [but to keep total emissions
from exceeding specific carbon budgets]{.underline} (a matter of
stocks). For green growth theory, then, [the question is not only
whether we can achieve absolute decoupling and reduce emissions, but
whether we can reduce emissions **fast enough**]{.underline} to stay
within the carbon budgets for 1.5°C or 2°C, as per the Paris Agreement[,
while still continuing economic growth]{.underline}. A number of
high-income countries have seen declining emissions in the twenty-first
century, despite continued economic growth. Figure 4(a) shows declining
emissions in the US and EU28, in both territorial and consumption-based
terms, from 2006 to 2016 (i.e. absolute decoupling). [However, emissions
from the global South have continued upward]{.underline}, albeit at a
slower rate than GDP (i.e. relative decoupling). [China's emissions
declined slightly between 2014 and 2016 (a brief period of absolute
decoupling), before growing again in 2017. **On a global level, [CO2
emissions]{.mark} have increased steadily[,
fall]{.mark}**]{.underline}ing **[[only during]{.mark} periods of
economic [recession]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Figure 4(b)). [Global
emissions did level off in 2015 and 2016 while GDP continued to
rise]{.underline}, prompting the International Energy Agency, a research
arm of the OECD, to announce 'Decoupling of global emissions and
economic growth confirmed' (IEA 2016), [while media outlets celebrated
'peak emissions']{.underline} (Meyer 2016). [This news briefly came to
constitute a key element of optimistic green growth narratives, until
global emissions began to rise again in 2017]{.underline} (1.6 per cent)
[and 2018]{.underline} (2.7 per cent). [Analysts attribute the temporary
plateau to a shift in China away from coal and (mostly) toward oil and
gas, and a shift in the US to natural gas.5 Once these shifts were
complete, continued economic growth drove emissions up
again.]{.underline} Overall, global carbon productivity has been
slowing. World Bank data shows that carbon productivity (CO2 per 2010
\$US GDP) improved steadily from 1960 to 2000, with decarbonisation
happening at an average rate of 1.28 per cent per year (relative
decoupling). However, from 2000 to

2014 there was no improvement in carbon productivity -- in other words[,
**not even relative decoupling has been achieved in the twenty-first
century**]{.underline}.6 High-income nations have done better, at least
in terms of territorial emissions (the World Bank does not track
consumption-based emissions), but even so progress has slowed, from an
average rate of 1.91 per cent per year from 1970 to 2000, down to 1.61
per cent per year from 2000 to 2014. **[Existing trends are incompatible
with the Paris Agreement targets]{.underline}**. [Business-as-usual is
set to lead to 4.2°C]{.underline} of warming (2.5°C to 5.5°C) by 2100.
Even with the Nationally Determined Contributions and Intended
Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement, global
warming is still projected to reach 3.3°C (1.9°C to 4.4°C) -- an
improvement over the BAU scenario but still far exceeding the 1.5°C and
2°C thresholds.7 In order to keep warming below these thresholds, the
world will have to make much more aggressive emissions reductions. [[The
IPCC']{.mark}s Fifth Assessment Report]{.underline}
(**[AR5]{.underline}**) [includes 116 mitigation scenarios]{.underline}
that are consistent with Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6
(RCP2.6), which offers the best chances of staying below 2°C. [All of
these scenarios are green growth scenarios in that they stabilise global
temperatures while global GDP continues to rise]{.underline}. Rising GDP
is a built-in feature of the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs),
which form the basis for the IPCC mitigation scenarios (Kuhnhenn 2018).
[AR5 warns]{.underline}, however, that [these scenarios 'typically
involve temporary overshoot of atmospheric concentrations' and
'typically [rely on]{.mark} the availability and widespread deployment
of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage
([BECCS]{.mark}]{.underline})' (2014, p. 23). Indeed, the vast majority
scenarios for 2°C (101 of the 116) rely on BECCS to the point of
achieving negative emissions.8 [BECCS entails growing large tree
plantations to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere, harvesting the
biomass, burning it for energy, capturing the CO2 emissions at source
and storing it underground]{.underline}. Relying on these 'negative
emissions technologies' allows for a much larger carbon budget (about
double the actual size) by assuming that we can successfully reduce
global atmospheric carbon in the second half of the century. BECCS is
highly controversial among climate scientists. It was first proposed by
Obersteiner et al. (2001) and Keith (2001) at the turn of the century.
[IPCC modelling teams began including it in their scenarios from 2005,
**[despite having no]{.mark} firm [evidence of]{.mark} its
[feasibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [With the publication of AR5, BECCS
was enshrined as a dominant assumption]{.underline}. Obersteiner has
expressed alarm at the rapid uptake of his idea; he considers BECCS to
be what he calls a 'risk-management strategy', or a 'backstop
technology' in case climate feedback loops turn out to be worse than
expected, and says the IPCC has 'misused' it by including it in regular
scenarios to take pressure off of conventional mitigation pathways (i.e.
emissions reductions) (Hickman 2016). In Keith's (2001) initial
formulation of the idea, he noted that while 'measured use' of biomass
could help mitigate environmental problems, 'large scale use of cropped
biomass will not.' Anderson and Peters (2016) point out that [the
'allure' of BECCS is due to the fact that it allows politicians to
postpone the need for rapid emissions reductions]{.underline}: 'BECCS
licenses the ongoing combustion of fossil fuels while ostensibly
fulfilling the Paris Commitments.' There are a number of concerns.
First, [the viability of power generation with CCS has **never been
proven to be economically viable or scalable**; [it would
require]{.mark} the construction of **15,000 facilities**]{.underline}
(Peters 2017). Second, [the scale of biomass assumed in the AR5
scenarios would require plantations **covering [land]{.mark} two to
[three times the size of India]{.mark}**[,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[which
raises questions about]{.mark} **land** availability, competition with
**[food]{.mark}** production, **[carbon neutrality]{.mark}, [and
biod]{.mark}iversity loss**]{.underline} (Smith et al. 2016; Heck et al.
2018). Third[, the necessary storage capacity may not exist]{.underline}
(De Coninck and Benson 2014, Global CCS Institute 2015). Anderson and
Peters conclude that ['BECCS thus remains a highly speculative
technology' and that relying on it is therefore **'an unjust and high
stakes gamble':**]{.underline} if it is unsuccessful, 'society will be
locked into a high-temperature pathway.' This conclusion is shared by a
growing number of scientists (e.g. Fuss et al. 2014, Vaughan and Gough,
2016, Larkin et al. 2017, Van Vuuren et al. 2017), and by the European
Academies' Science Advisory Council (2018). It is not clear that we can
justifiably rely on BECCS, an unproven technology, to underwrite green
growth theory. If we accept this point, then we must return to asking
whether it is possible to maintain growth without relying on BECCS to
stay within the carbon budgets consistent with the Paris Agreement.
Without BECCS, global emissions need to fall to net zero by 2050 for
1.5°C, or by 2075 for 2°C.9 This entails reductions of 6.8 per cent per
year and 4 per cent per year, respectively (Figure 5). Theoretically,
this can be accomplished with (a) a rapid shift to 100 per cent
renewable energy to eliminate emissions from fossil fuel combustion
(Jacobson and Delucchi 2011); plus (b) afforestation and soil
regeneration to eliminate emissions from land use change; plus (c) a
shift to alternative industrial processes to eliminate emissions from
the production of cement, steel, and plastic. The question is, can all
of this be accomplished quickly enough? **[Only 6 of the 116 scenarios
for 2°C in AR5 exclude BECCS]{.underline}**. [These work by assuming
'**optimal full technology'** in all other areas, plus **mass
afforestation**, and with high mitigation costs]{.underline}. These
represent theoretically possible pathways, but **[without any empirical
evidence as to their feasibility]{.underline}**. **[Results of empirical
studies are not promising]{.underline}**. Schandl et al. (2016) model
what might be achieved with aggressive mitigation policies, without
relying on BECCS. Their high-efficiency scenario has a carbon price
starting at \$50 per ton (rising by 4 per cent per year to \$236 by
2050) plus a doubling in the material efficiency of the economy due to
technological innovations (improving from a historical average rate of
1.5 per cent per year up to 4.5 per cent). Schandl et al provide no
evidence for the feasibility of the efficiency improvements that they
assume. Even so, the result shows that with global growth of 3 per cent
per year, annual emissions plateau to 2050 but do not decline. In this
scenario,

growth in energy demand outstrips the rate of decarbonisation, violating
the carbon budgets for 1.5°C and 2°C. The International Renewable Energy
Association ([IRENA]{.underline} 2018) have [modelled a scenario for
continued GDP growth compatible with 2°C by relying on [a **rapid shift
to renewable**]{.mark} **energy**]{.underline} (consistent with Jacobson
and Delucchi 2011). [The scenario [requires]{.mark} adding 12,200 GW of
solar and wind capacity by 2050]{.underline}, [with a dramatic increase
in installation rates]{.underline} (2.3 to **[[4]{.mark}.6 [times faster
than the present]{.mark}]{.underline}**).10 **[The scenario
[also]{.mark} requires that the [energy intensity]{.mark} of the global
economy [falls by]{.mark} twothirds]{.underline}** (by 2.8 per cent per
year, **[[double the historical rate]{.underline}]{.mark}**), lowering
energy demand in 2050 to slightly less than 2015 levels.11 This is
feasible inasmuch as the transition to wind and solar itself improves
energy efficiency (Jacobson and Delucchi 2011).12 Still, [even this
optimistic scenario accomplishes only 90 per cent of the necessary
emissions reductions for 2°C]{.underline} (likely because it pays no
attention to emissions from land use change and cement production). [The
model relies on negative emissions technology to cover most of the
remainder]{.underline}. Van Vuuren et al. (2018) consider 'alternative
pathways' for meeting the Paris Agreement targets without relying on
widespread use of negative emissions technologies. [They model rising
GDP]{.underline} in accordance with SSP2. [In addition to a [carbon
tax]{.mark} and other aggressive mitigation strategies]{.underline},
their optimistic scenario includes the following settings: [global
[population]{.mark}]{.underline} peaks at 8.4 billion in 2050 and
**[[declines]{.underline}]{.mark}** to 6.9 billion by 2100; [[meat
consumption declines]{.mark} 80 per cent]{.underline} by 2050; [all new
cars and airplanes are efficient from 2025]{.underline}; the [world
shifts to the most [efficient technologies]{.mark} for steel and cement
production, etc]{.underline}. **[[Even with]{.mark} these [highly
optimistic assumption]{.mark}]{.underline}**[s]{.mark} in place, they
find that [the pressures of continued growth drive emissions to
[exceed]{.mark} the [carbon budgets]{.mark}]{.underline} for 1.5°C and
**[2°C]{.underline}**, without negative emissions technologies. Another
way to approach this question is by looking at projected rates of
decoupling[. If we assume global GDP continues to grow at 3 percent per
year]{.underline} (the average from 2010 to 2014), **[then [decoupling
must occur at]{.mark} a rate of [10.]{.mark}5 per cent per
year]{.underline}** for 1.5°C, or 7.3 per cent per year for 2°C. If
global GDP grows at 2.1 per cent per year (as PWC predicts), then
decoupling must occur at 9.6 per cent per year for 1.5°C, or 6.4 per
cent per year for 2°C. **[All of these targets are beyond what existing
empirical models indicate is feasible]{.underline}**. The Schandl et al
model indicates [that [decoupling can happen]{.mark} by **[at most
3]{.mark} per cent [per year]{.mark} under optimistic
conditions**]{.underline}. Other models arrive at similar conclusions.
Before adopting BECCS assumptions, [the IPCC]{.underline} (2000)
[projected decoupling of 3.3 per cent per year in a global best-case
scenario]{.underline}. The C-ROADS tool (developed by Climate
Interactive and MIT Sloan) projects decoupling of at most 4 per cent per
year under the most aggressive possible abatement policies: high
subsidies for renewables and nuclear power, plus high taxes on oil, gas
and coal. All of these results fall short of the decoupling rate that
must be achieved if the global economy continues to grow at expected
rates. Holz et al. (2018) find that if we rule out widespread use of
negative emissions technologies, the required rate of decarbonisation
for meeting the Paris Agreement is 'well outside what is currently
deemed achievable, based on historical evidence and standard modelling.'
The challenge is even more difficult for rich nations. Anderson and Bows
(2011) have modelled the emissions reductions necessary for achieving a
50 per cent chance of staying under 2°C (more relaxed than the
two-thirds chance that the UNFCC calls for), without BECCS. They proceed
from the principle of 'common but differentiated responsibility',
whereby rich nations (Annex-1 nations) make more aggressive emissions
reductions than poor nations, owing to their greater historical
responsibility for emissions and their greater capacity for managing the
costs of transition. They assume that Non-Annex 1 nations defer peak
emissions until 2025, and thereafter reduce emissions by 7 per cent per
year. They acknowledge that these are extremely ambitious assumptions
but consider them to be the most feasible compromise between
practicality and equity. To stay within the remaining carbon budget,
Annex 1 nations need to reduce emissions by 8--10 per cent per year,
beginning in 2015. This model was developed with data up to 2010; as the
remaining carbon budget is now smaller, Anderson estimates that Annex 1
nations need to reduce emissions by 12 per cent per year.13 If we accept
that Annex 1 nations need to achieve emissions reductions of 12 per cent
per year, and if we assume that GDP growth in Annex 1 nations continues
at 1.86 per cent per year (the average from 2010 to 2014), then
decoupling must occur at a rate of 15.8 per cent per year.14 For
perspective, this is eight times faster than the historic rate of
decoupling in Annex 1 nations (viz., 1.9 per cent per year from 1970 to
2013), and it is important to bear in mind that the rate of decoupling
has generally slowed over this period.15 It also exceeds the decoupling
rate implied by the average G20 Nationally Determined Contributions
under the Paris Agreement (viz., 3 per cent per year) by a factor of
five. There is one empirical model that feasibly accomplishes emissions
reductions consistent with the Paris Agreement, without relying on
negative emissions technologies. Published by Grubler et al. (2018), it
was included in the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C (2018) in response to
growing critiques of the IPCC's reliance on BECCS. The scenario, known
as 'Low Energy Demand' (LED), accomplishes emissions reductions
compatible with 1.5°C by reducing global energy demand by 40 per cent by
2050. In addition to decarbonisation and afforestation, the key feature
of this scenario is that global material production and consumption
declines significantly: 'The aggregate total material output decreases
by close to 20 per cent from today, one-third due to dematerialization,
and twothirds due to improvements in material efficiency.'
Dematerialisation is accomplished by shifting away from private
ownership of key commodities (like cars) towards sharing-based models.
LED differentiates between the global North and South. Industrial
activity declines by 42 per cent in the North and 12 per cent in the
South. With efficiency improvements, this translates into industrial
energy demand declining by 57 per cent in the North and 23 per cent in
the South. The LED scenario projects continued GDP growth at just over 2
per cent per year, which would make it consistent with green growth
theory. However, the empirical basis for this GDP trend is not robust.
It is derived from the MESSAGE-Globium model, which calculates GDP from
only two inputs: labour supply (population size and productivity) and
energy. The low energy demand in the LED scenario does not affect growth
because it is offset by efficiency improvements. As the model is
insensitive to changes in material throughput, reductions in production
and consumption do not affect output. The paper offers no evidence that
GDP will continue to grow despite such reductions. Charlie Wilson, one
of the paper's authors, acknowledged that 'we did not consider broader
questions of GDP growth or degrowth, and we did not explicitly report
relationships between our scenario and GDP outcomes for this reason.' 16
Conclusions and discussion [The empirical data demonstrate that while
absolute decoupling of GDP from emissions is possible and is already
happening in some regions, it is unlikely **to happen fast
enough**]{.underline} to respect the carbon budgets for 1.5°C and 2°C
against a background of continued economic growth. Growth increases
energy demand, making the transition to renewable energy more difficult,
and increases emissions from land use change and industrial processes.
Models that do project green growth within the constraints of the Paris
Agreement rely heavily on negative emissions technologies that are
either unproven or dangerous at scale. Without these technologies, the
rates of decarbonisation required for 1.5°C or 2°C are significantly
steeper than extant models suggest is feasible even with aggressive
mitigation policies.

[The]{.underline} first [heroic assumption underpinning techno-optimist
solutions is the ongoing reliance]{.underline} in many of the most
influential large scale [decarbonization strategies on CCS]{.underline}
(carbon capture and storage). While CCS may play a valuable, albeit
modest, long term role, [the current state of knowledge suggests that
**[we are]{.mark} still [a]{.mark} very [long way from]{.mark}
affordable and [scalable CCS]{.mark} deployment**]{.underline}. [Even
the Global CCS Institute]{.underline} (2013: 5) [has recently reported
that, "while CCS projects are progressing, the pace is well below the
level required for CCS to make substantial contribution to climate
change mitigation]{.underline}". The growing "emissions gap" is also
providing increasing impetus for speculation about the "necessity" of
geoengineering "solutions" with all their attendant concerns about
ethical implications and unintended consequences (see Hamilton 2013).

[The second debatable assumption is that technological innovation will
necessarily and rapidly translate into global reductions]{.underline} in
energy consumption. [Important **[questions remain about]{.mark} the
[speed]{.mark} with [which]{.mark} 100% [renewable energy can
realistically be achieved]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see e.g. Smil 2010,
2014); [the extent of fossil fuel energy consumption required to drive
the initial massive expansion in renewable energy infrastructure; and
the full life cycle energy return on investment (EROI)]{.underline}
outcomes of solar and wind energy---[particularly if these calculations
factor in the full costs of energy storage]{.underline} (see e.g. Palmer
2013; Prieto and Hall 2013). Noting that emissions reductions of 4% p.a.
in an economy growing at 2% p.a. are likely to require carbon intensity
improvements of around 6% p.a., Anderson (2013) notes that he has yet to
find any credible mainstream economist prepared to argue that prolonged
emissions reductions of 3% or 4% or more are compatible with economic
growth.

Indeed, as Lord Stern (2006: 231) himself has noted: [There is likely to
be a **[maximum practical rate]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[at which]{.mark}
global [emissions can be reduced]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the national
level, [there are examples of sustained emissions cuts of up to 1% per
year]{.underline} associated with structural change in energy
systems\... whilst maintaining strong economic growth. However,
[[cuts]{.mark} in emissions [greater]{.mark} than this [have]{.mark}
historically [been associated **only** with]{.mark} economic
[recession]{.mark} or upheaval]{.underline}, for example, the emissions
reduction of 5.2% per year for a decade associated with the economic
transition and strong reduction in output in the former Soviet Union.
[These magnitudes of cuts suggest it is likely to be **very challenging
to reduce emissions** by more than a few percent per year while
maintaining strong economic growth]{.underline}.

[The third reason for caution in assuming overly optimistic
relationships between technological innovation,]{.underline} carbon
intensity and emissions reductions [is the impact of the "[rebound
effect]{.mark}"]{.underline} (see Jevons 1865; Herring and Sorrell 2009;
Holm and Englund 2009; Jackson 2009). [This]{.underline} phenomenon
[refers to the tendency for innovation and efficiency gains to be
**rapidly [overwhelm]{.mark}ed**]{.underline} [as cheaper]{.underline}
unit costs combined with the formidable reach and power of the global
advertising industry enable [[and encourage]{.mark} [individuals to
**consume more**]{.mark}]{.underline} [of the same or alternative
services and products.]{.underline} [The harsh reality remains that
global emissions continue to grow]{.underline} (IPCC 2013)---along with
the global trends in the consumption of energy and resources---[with
apparent improvements in developed economy energy [efficiency]{.mark}
often **[masking the reality of]{.mark} energy intensive [production
being offshored]{.mark} to developing economies**]{.underline}.

The [[likelihood of]{.mark} full and [fast deployment]{.mark} of new
technologies [is]{.mark} the fourth [problematic]{.mark}
assumption]{.underline} that needs to be addressed [[given]{.mark} the
**formidable [political and social obstacles]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[standing in the way of rapid implementation]{.underline}. As noted in
the recent Post Carbon Pathways review of learning from the
implementation of large-scale decarbonization strategies (see Wiseman et
al. 2013), [experienced climate scientists and policymakers consistently
come to the conclusion that the key obstacles standing in the way of
rapid decarbonization are political and social rather than
technological]{.underline}. Key roadblocks include the following.

#### Innovation faces diminishing marginal returns

Christopher **Ketcham 17**, writer for the Pacific Standard, among other
publications, citing Joseph Tainter, a professor of sustainability at
Utah State University, "The Fallacy of Endless Economic Growth,"
5/16/17, https://psmag.com/magazine/fallacy-of-endless-growth

Now, [at the very moment that we need innovation to
accelerate]{.underline}---to mount a viable response to climate change,
to locate new resources and replace dwindling or despoiled
ones---**[evidence suggests that the opposite is
happening]{.underline}**. Joseph Tainter, a professor of sustainability
at Utah State University, examined innovation trends using 30 years of
data from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. What he found was
troubling. Slightly more than half of all patents issued in this country
are to foreign entities, so Tainter considered changes to the number of
patents per applicant to be an accurate indicator of global productivity
as expressed through invention. [In]{.underline} the [major technical
fields]{.underline} he studied---[drugs]{.underline} and chemicals,
[metallurgy]{.underline}, [energy, biotech]{.underline}nology,
[information]{.underline} technology, [and so on]{.underline}---he found
that [the number of researchers on each patent **steadily
increased**]{.underline} between 1974 and 2005. **[This means more time
and man-hours]{.underline}**---[and presumably **more money
invested**]{.underline}---[for a declining return]{.underline}. In his
1988 book The Collapse of Complex Societies---a kind of companion volume
to Limits---Tainter makes the case that [[as civilizations grow
they]{.mark} [produce]{.mark} [**increasingly complex problems**]{.mark}
that demand **increasingly complex solutions**]{.underline}. [Complexity
demands more energy, requiring new technologies]{.underline} for energy
extraction. But, as Tainter\'s study suggests, innovation may have its
own limits.

The concept of [[energy-return]{.mark}-on-investment]{.underline}, known
as EROI, was originally coined in reference to fossil-fuel exploration,
and is commonly used to compare the amount of energy required to
extract, transport, and refine a particular resource with the amount of
energy it ultimately provides. EROI [for our master energy source
[happens to be]{.mark} **[plummeting]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [as
discovery and extraction of fossil fuels becomes more difficult and
costly]{.underline}. (The rising cost---which is to say complexity---of
resource extraction and retrieval was one of Limits\' broad projections
that also turned out to be accurate.) EROI for global oil and gas
production went from 30-to-1 in 1995 to 18-to-1 in 2006. In the U.S.,
the EROI for oil discovery in 1919 was an astonishing 1,000-to-1. By the
2010s, it was 5-to-1.

[[In mining]{.mark}, multifactor productivity]{.underline}---which
reflects the efficiency with which the inputs of capital, labor,
materials, services, and energy generate a unit of mineral
product---[has been on a downward slope since 2002]{.underline}.
According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, [[it]{.mark} now
[takes **40 percent more inputs**]{.mark} to dig up minerals in
general]{.underline}, [while the grain sizes and ore grades of what\'s
being retrieved are declining]{.underline}. The Journal of Environmental
Science and Engineering reported in 2013 that, \"[under the present
paradigm of use,]{.underline}\" [[the world]{.underline}]{.mark}, within
decades, [[will]{.mark} begin [see]{.mark}ing \"[scarcity\" of]{.mark}
\"most of the strategically important [metals and materials]{.mark} that
are **[fundamental to]{.mark} \[the\] running of [our]{.mark}
[societies]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\" According to the study\'s lead
authors, a chemical engineering professor at Lund University in Sweden
and an applied systems analyst at Stockholm University, \"**[scarcity
may lead \[to\] \'peak civilization]{.underline}**,\' [unless urgent
countermeasures are **systematically undertaken**.]{.underline}\"

Even in the midst of substantial innovation, today\'s global economy has
become more profligate and more wasteful, using more materials per unit
of GDP than it did 20 years ago. According to a 2016 report from the
International Resource Panel at the United Nations Environment
Programme, [the amount of]{.underline} virgin [natural resource needed
for a given amount of product has gone up 17 percent over a single
decade]{.underline}. In 2000, it took an average 1.2 kilograms of
materials to generate one dollar of global GDP. By 2010, it took 1.4
kilograms. The amount of primary materials extracted from the Earth
globally rose from 22 billion tonnes in 1970 to 70 billion tonnes in
2010, with per capita global material use going from seven tonnes in
1970 to 10 tonnes over the same 40-year period. According to the report,
[there is \"growing environmental pressure per unit of economic
activity,\" not less]{.underline}.

Optimists will undoubtedly look to renewable energy as a stay against
declining EROI and rising seas. But they may be blindsided by the stark
limits of wind, solar, and hydro. Researchers at Monash University,
marshaling considerable data, concluded that the [cheerful scenarios
projecting renewables will supply most of the world\'s energy by
mid-century \"assume **unrealistic technical potentials and
implementation times**]{.underline}.\" Which means we\'ll be stuck
mostly with fossil fuels to keep the expansion machine running. Tim
Jackson of the University of Surrey has calculated that, [at current
rates of carbon density]{.underline}---the amount of carbon released per
unit of energy consumed---[our]{.underline} greenhouse gas [emissions
will increase by more than 2 percent per year]{.underline}. At that
rate, by 2050 carbon dioxide emissions would be more than double what
they were in 2015. [To achieve a tenfold reduction in global emissions
by 2050]{.underline}, [carbon density would have to decline]{.underline}
on average 8.6 percent annually---almost **[10 times the rate at which
it has declined over the last 50 years]{.underline}** [and **50 times
faster** than in the past decade]{.underline}. In other words, we would
have to innovate carbon-reduction strategies at rates never before seen,
with technologies of immense effectiveness whose global-scale
implementation would be entirely unprecedented.

### AT: Tech Good

of New South Wales, "If you want affluence, prepare for War," The
International Journal of Inclusive Democracy, July 2002, Volume 8, Issue

The logically inescapable implications from the foregoing discussion is
that global peace cannot be achieved before there has been a vast and
historically unprecedented transition to \"The Simpler Way\'. The
accelerating global predicament cannot be remedied until social,
economic, political and cultural systems based on competitive
individualism, acquisitiveness, affluence and
[[growth]{.underline}]{.mark} are [[abandoned]{.underline}]{.mark} and
replaced by ways of life based on production to meet needs rather than
profits, high levels of individual and local self-sufficiency,
co-operation, participation, mutual assistance and sharing, and above
all on willing acceptance of materially simple lifestyles within
zero-growth national economies.^76^ This [[does not mean]{.mark}
hardship and deprivation]{.underline}; indeed it can be argued that
[high levels of simplicity]{.underline}, self-sufficiency and
co-operation [are]{.underline} the [necessary]{.underline} conditions
[for a high quality of life]{.underline}, as well as for global justice
[and ecological sustainability. **Nor does it mean [absence
of]{.mark}**]{.underline} sophisticated
**[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology **[[and
research]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It does mean a landscape made up mostly
of small towns and villages within comfortable distance of small cities
by public transport, with relatively little heavy industry, travel and
transport, international trade or big firms. Most 'government' would
have to be carried out through small local participatory assemblies.
Because large sectors of the present economy would no longer be
necessary, [the overall amount of work for monetary income would
probably be reduced]{.underline} by two-thirds, [enabling a]{.underline}
much [more relaxed pace of life. [There would be no need to
reduce]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[sophistication and quality of research
and tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology within socially desirable fields.

Applications Centre/Space Propulsion Centre, NIE, Nanyang Technological
University. 2019. "Mars Colonization: Beyond Getting There." Global
Challenges, vol. 3, no. 1.

Settlement of Mars---is it a dream or a necessity? [From scientific
publications to public forms, there is certainly little consensus on
whether colonization of Mars is **necessary** or even
**possible**]{.underline}, with a rich diversity of opinions that range
from categorical It is a necessity!20 to equally categorical Should
Humans Colonize Other Planets? No.21 A strong proponent of the idea,
[Orwig puts forward five reasons for Mars colonization, implicitly
stating that establishing a permanent colony of humans on Mars is no
longer an option but a real necessity]{.underline}.20 Specifically,
[these arguments are]{.underline}: **[Survival of humans as a
species]{.underline}**; Exploring the potential of life on Mars to
sustain humans; Using space technology to positively contribute to our
quality of life, from health to minimizing and reversing negative
aspects of anthropogenic activity of humans on Earth; Developing as a
species; Gaining political and economic leadership. [The first argument
captures the essence of what most space colonization proponents
feel---our ever growing environmental footprint threatens the survival
of human race on]{.underline} [Earth]{.underline}. Indeed, a large body
of evidence points to human activity as the main cause of extinction of
many species, with shrinking biodiversity and depleting resources
threatening the very survival of humans on this planet. [Colonization of
other planets could potentially increase the probability of our
survival.]{.underline} While being at the core of such ambitious
projects as Mars One, [[a **self‐sustained colony**]{.mark} **of any
size**]{.underline} on Mars **[[is hardly feasible]{.mark} in the
foreseeable future]{.underline}**. Indeed, [[sustaining even a **small
number**]{.underline} [of colonists would require a **continuous supply
of**]{.underline} ]{.mark}[**food, oxygen, water and basic
[materials]{.mark}**. At this stage, it is not clear whether it would be
possible to establish a system that would generate these resources
**locally**, or whether it would at least in part [rely on]{.mark} the
**[delivery]{.mark}** of these resources]{.underline} ([or]{.underline}
**[essential components]{.underline}** [necessary for their local
production) [from **Earth**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Beyond the supply of
these very basic resources, [it would be quite challenging if not
impossible]{.mark} for the colonists [to independently produce **hi‐tech
but vitally important assets**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[such as medicines,
electronics and robotics]{.mark} systems, or advanced materials that
provide us with a decent **quality of life**. In this case, would their
existence become little more than the **jogtrot of life**, as compared
with the standards expected at the Earth]{.underline}?22

#### Deep space travel is impossible

**Robinson 16** \[Kim Robinson, Scientific American.\] "What Will It
Take for Humans to Colonize the Milky Way?" 13 January 2016
(<https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-will-it-take-for-humans-to-colonize-the-milky-way1/>)
-- MZhu

The idea that humans will eventually travel to and inhabit other parts
of our galaxy was well expressed by the early Russian rocket scientist
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, who wrote, "Earth is humanity's cradle, but
you're not meant to stay in your cradle forever." Since then the idea
has been a staple of science fiction, and thus become part of a
consensus image of humanity's future. Going to the stars is often
regarded as humanity's destiny, even a measure of its success as a
species. But in the century [since this vision was proposed, things we
have learned about the universe and ourselves combine to suggest that
moving out into the galaxy **may not be humanity's destiny after
all.**]{.underline} The problem that tends to underlie all the other
problems with the idea is the [sheer size of the universe]{.underline},
which was not known when people first imagined we would go to the stars.
[Tau Ceti, one of the [closest star]{.mark}s to us at around [**12
light-years** away]{.mark}]{.underline}, is 100 billion times farther
from Earth than our moon. A quantitative difference that large turns
into a qualitative difference; [we can't simply send people over such
immense distances in a spaceship, **because [a spaceship is too
impoverished]{.mark} an environment [to support humans for the time it
would take]{.mark}**,]{.underline} which is on the [order of
centuries]{.underline}. Instead of a spaceship, [we would have to create
some kind of space-traveling **ark**, big enough to support a community
of humans and other plants and animals in a fully recycling ecological
system.]{.underline} On the other hand [it would have to be **small**
enough to **accelerate to a fairly high speed**]{.underline}, [to
shorten the voyagers' time of **exposure to [cosmic radiation]{.mark}**,
and to **breakdowns** in the ark]{.underline}. Regarded from som e
angles bigger is better, but [t[he bigger]{.mark} the ark is,
[the]{.mark} proportionally [more **fuel**]{.mark} it would have to
carry along to [slow it]{.mark}self [down]{.mark} on reaching its
destination]{.underline}; [this is a vicious circle that **can't be
squared**]{.underline}. For that reason and others, [smaller is better,
but [smallness creates problems for]{.mark} resource [metabolic flow and
ecologic balance]{.mark}]{.underline}. Island biogeography suggests the
kinds of problems that would result from this miniaturization, but a
space ark's isolation would be far more complete than that of any island
on Earth. The design imperatives for bigness and smallness may cross
each other, leaving any viable craft in a non-existent middle. The
biological problems that could result from the radical miniaturization,
simplification and isolation of an ark, no matter what size it is, now
must include possible impacts on our microbiomes. We are not autonomous
units; about eighty percent of the DNA in our bodies is not human DNA,
but the DNA of a vast array of smaller creatures. That array of living
beings has to function in a dynamic balance for us to be healthy, and
the entire complex system co-evolved on this planet's surface in a
particular set of physical influences, including Earth's gravity,
magnetic field, chemical make-up, atmosphere, insolation, and bacterial
load. Traveling to the stars means leaving all these influences, and
trying to replace them artificially. W[hat the viable parameters are on
the [replacements would be **impossible**]{.mark} to be sure of in
advance]{.underline}, [as the situation is]{.underline} **[too complex
to model]{.underline}**. [Any starfaring ark would therefore be an
**experiment**, its inhabitants lab animals.]{.underline} The first
generation of the humans aboard might have volunteered to be
experimental subjects, but their descendants would not have. These
[generations of descendants would be born into a set of rooms a trillion
times smaller than Earth, with no chance of escape.]{.underline} In this
radically diminished enviroment, rules would have to be enforced to keep
all aspects of the experiment functioning. Reproduction would not be a
matter of free choice, as the population in the ark would have to
maintain minimum and maximum numbers. Many jobs would be mandatory to
keep the ark functioning, so work too would not be a matter of choices
freely made. In the end, sharp constraints would force the social
structure in the ark to enforce various norms and behaviors. The
situation itself would require the establishment of something like a
totalitarian state. Of course sociology and psychology are harder fields
to make predictions in, as humans are highly adaptable. But history has
shown that people tend to react poorly in rigid states and social
systems. Add to these social constraints permanent enclosure, exile from
the planetary surface we evolved on, and the probability of health
problems, and the possibility for psychological difficulties and mental
illnesses seems quite high. Over several generations, it's hard to
imagine any such society staying stable.

5[. [Space-Age Weaponry]{.underline}]{.mark} and the Balance of Terror
Yet there is another strategy for neutralizing the Hobbesian trap,
namely, a policy of deterrence, also known as a "balance of terror" or,
during the Cold War, "mutually-assured destruction" (MAD). This asserts
that "if you strike me, I will most assuredly strike back with equal or
greater force, and if I strike you it will only be because you struck me
first."xvii Deterrence is only effective when one's adversaries
genuinely believe the statement, "I will most assuredly strike back."
This returns us to Hobbes's third cause of conflict from section 3:
glory, honor, or credibility. To establish credibility and, therefore,
dissuade potential attackers, one has reason to engage in confrontations
with others and, in doing so, to demonstrate one's capacity for
violence. The question is whether policies of deterrence implemented by
civilizations throughout the cosmos would be sufficient to obviate war.
To answer this question, let's begin by considering the unsettling range
of weapons that will likely be available to our spacefaring progeny; we
will then explore how these weapons could enhance or mitigate the
effectiveness of deterrence. 5.1 **[[Weapons of Total Destruction
(WTDs]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [There are a variety of "kill mechanisms"
that one [civilization]{.mark} could use to [obliterate another]{.mark}.
In relatively **close propinquity**, **chemical**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[biological weapons]{.underline}** [could offer a
means of targeted violence]{.underline}, since the deleterious effects
of such weapons might be limited to a particular species (Deudney
forthcoming). For example, the toxicity of a chemical X might be low for
a species A but lethal to a species B. This could enable A to use X on B
without fear of X harming A---a concern that has dissuaded some
terrorists from employing chemical weapons. The same goes for a
pathogenic germ Y: since pathogens often only harm single species,
biological weapons could be used without the perpetrators worrying about
becoming sick. [With respect to]{.underline}
**[a]{.underline}**rtificial **[i]{.underline}**ntelligences, [there
could be]{.underline} **[viral malware]{.underline}** [that affects only
certain types of software]{.underline}; in this case, [such viruses
could be transferred not at the velocity of a sneeze but at the speed of
light]{.underline}, traversing astronomically large stretches of space
to devastate colonies of artificial-substrate beings. [Another
possibility involves **weaponizing**]{.underline} "minor planets" like
**[asteroids]{.underline}**. This hints at the deflection dilemma
discussed by Sagan (1994), among others, whereby the very same
technology that could deflect an asteroid away from Earth could also be
used to redirect one toward it. [The resultant "[planetoid bombs" could
be]{.mark} [launched]{.mark} in the direction of target civilizations
[at extremely **high velocities**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[and
inflict]{.underline} **[far greater destruction than all the nuclear
arsenals on Earth combined]{.underline}** (see Cole and Cox 1965;
Deudney forthcoming). [Even more, asteroids are **extremely
numerous**]{.underline} [in the solar system]{.underline} and have a
wide range of sizes, with estimates of 1.1 to 1.9 million that have
greater-than-1-kilometer diameters in the asteroid belt between Mars and
Jupiter. ([A 1- kilometer impactor striking Earth would
likely]{.underline} **[annihilate humanity]{.underline}** [by causing
an]{.underline} **[impact winter]{.underline}**.) Thus, [asteroids
constitute an abundant source of easily obtainable,]{.underline}
[**[civilization-ending weaponry]{.mark}**--- a particularly worrisome
fact given that the technological capabilities to redirect asteroids
will likely **[emerge]{.mark} at an early stage in our diaspora "out of
Earth,"**]{.underline} as it were (see Deudney forthcoming). [Other
futuristic space weapons include **military drones**]{.underline} that
either initiate attacks or engage in clandestine surveillance of other
civilizations. [Such drones could]{.underline} hide themselves from
counter-surveillance detectors by employing metamaterial invisibility
cloaks and [**propagate themselves** through]{.underline} the [[von
Neumann]{.underline}]{.mark} process of
[self[-replication]{.mark}]{.underline}, that is, by converting raw
materials into clones of themselves. There is also the possibility of
using "heliobeams," or "sun guns," to destroy targets by concentrating
large amounts of solar radiation via a concave mirror on a satellite.
[Even]{.underline} **[more catastrophic]{.underline}** [are]{.underline}
direct-energy weapons (**[DEWs]{.underline}**) like lasers and
particlebeams that use highly focused energy to superheat their targets.
[In fact, the US government has already developed weapons of this
sort]{.underline}---they are science fact rather than
fiction---[although future breakthroughs could enable them to become
immensely more destructive. If this is the case, they will offer yet
another mechanism for]{.underline} **[[wreak]{.mark}ing [unprecedented
harm]{.mark}]{.underline}** (see Deudney forthcoming). Along these
lines, Anders Sandberg (forthcoming) [suggests that technologically
advanced civilizations could potentially use]{.underline}
**[gravitational waves]{.underline}** [to [create]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[**black holes**]{.mark}. Generating waves of sufficient intensity
would be **energetically inefficient**, according to current physics,
but they have the advantage that they can **interact with dark matter
objects**]{.underline}, unlike electromagnetic-energy weapons. [Even
more, the **[universe]{.mark}** appears]{.underline} [to be
in]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [**"[metastable" energy state]{.mark}**.
This suggests that [one could **tip it into**]{.mark} **a more stable,
[lower-energy state]{.mark}**, perhaps by]{.underline} **[concentrating
huge quantities of energy in tiny regions of spacetime]{.underline}**,
as occurs in some high-powered physics experiments. [In other words, [a
particle collider]{.mark} could be weaponized to intentionally [nucleate
a "vacuum bubble]{.mark}," or sphere of "true vacuum" **spreading in all
directions at the speed of light and [destroying everything]{.mark} with
which it comes into contact**. Who might weaponize a particle collider?
First, [there could be actors who use the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[threat of a vacuum bubble]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
**[blackmail]{.underline}**]{.mark} purposes. [Second, there could
be]{.underline} **[madmen]{.underline}** ([like Hitler) who create a
vacuum bubble to avoid defeat. That is to say, a predatory actor could
hold the following preference ordering: (i) triumphant victory over,
say, its Local Group, (ii) total annihilation of the universe, and (iii)
defeat.]{.underline} Third, **[particle colliders]{.underline}**
[would]{.underline} also [be]{.underline} the **[ideal]{.underline}**
WTD [for RNUs, since it would enable them to obliterate not only all
extant life in the universe but the **very potential for life to
arise**]{.underline}---and it would do this without inflicting any
suffering whatsoever.xviii [Another possibility is that]{.underline}
**[Tuckerian actors]{.underline}** [create a vacuum bubble for the
purely]{.underline} **[defensive reason]{.underline}** [of **eliminating
all potential attackers in the universe**]{.underline}. As Sandberg
(2017) speculates, it might be possible for "certain configurations of
matter, energy, black holes, etc. \[to\] induce a post-transition
structure that can act as an assembler." This "assembler" would enable
"some information \[to\] be transmitted into the new state," thus making
it possible for a civilization to "survive," in some sense, the universe
settling into a lower-energy configuration. On the other side of this
transition, the "structure" can recrudesce into a daughter new
civilization with the certitude that it is completely alone and,
therefore, safe. Finally, it is crucial to note that **[future
beings]{.underline}**---some of whom may have hugely augmented cognitive
capacities---[will almost certainly **invent new weapons** that are
**more powerful and effective than anything we could
imagine**]{.underline}. [Such weapons could enable civilizations---or
perhaps lone wolves, of which there could be, once again, **trillions
and trillions and trillions**---to cause **unprecedented injury** to
other civilizations]{.underline}. Consider the following passage from
Bostrom (2013): [One can readily imagine a class of
existential-catastrophe scenarios in which some technology is discovered
that puts **immense destructive power into the hands of a large number
of individuals**]{.underline}. [If [there is no effective
defense]{.mark} against this destructive power, [and no way to prevent
individuals from having access to it]{.mark}, then **civilization cannot
last**]{.underline}, [since in a **sufficiently large population** there
are **bound to be some individuals who will use any destructive power
available to them.**]{.underline} Scale this up from the individual
level to the cosmopolitical level and the same conclusion follows:
**[Life in the universe cannot last.]{.underline}**

### AT: Asteroids

#### No impact and we got time

**Bennett 2010** (James, Prof of Economics at George Mason, *The
Doomsday Lobby: Hype and Panic from Sputniks, Martians, and Marauding
Meteors*, p. 144-145)

It should be noted that [the Alvarez]{.underline} et al. [hypothesis was
not universally accepted]{.underline}. As Peter M. Sheehan and Dale A.
Russell wrote in their paper "Faunal Change Following the
Cretaceous--Tertiary Impact: Using Paleontological Data to Assess the
Hazards of Impacts," published in Hazards Due to Comets & Asteroids
(1994), edited by Tom Gehrels, "[many paleontologists resist accepting a
cause and effect relationship" between the]{.underline} iridum evidence,
the [Chicxulub crater, and the mass extinction of 65 million years
ago]{.underline}.15 For instance, Dennis V. Kent of the Lamont--Doherty
Geological Observatory of Columbia University, writing in Science,
disputed that a high concentration of iridium is necessarily "associated
with an extraordinary extraterrestrial event" and that, moreover, "[a
[large asteroid... is not likely to have]{.mark} had the [dire
consequences]{.mark} to life on the earth that they
propose]{.underline}."16 Briefly, Kent argues that the Alvarez team
mistakenly chose the 1883 Krakatoa eruption as the standard from it
extrapolated the effects of stratospheric material upon sunlight. Yet
Krakatoa was too small a volcanic eruption from which to draw any such
conclusions; better, says Kent, is [the [Toba]{.mark}]{.underline}
caldera in Sumatra, remnant of an enormous [eruption]{.underline} 75,000
years ago. (A caldera is the imprint left upon the earth from a volcanic
eruption.) The volume of the Toba caldera [is]{.underline} 400 times as
great as that of Krakatoa -- considerably [[closer to the effect]{.mark}
that an asteroid impact might have. Yet the sunlight "attenuation factor
\[for Toba\] is not nearly as large as the one postulated]{.underline}
by Alvarez et al. [for the asteroid impact]{.underline}." Indeed, [the
Toba eruption is [not associated with]{.mark} any [mass
extinctions]{.mark}]{.underline}, leading Kent to believe that "the
cause of the massive extinctions is not closely related to a drastic
reduction in sunlight alone."17 Reporting in Science, Richard A. Kerr
wrote that "[Many geologists, paleontologists, astronomers, and
statisticians... find the geological evidence]{.underline} merely
suggestive or even [nonexistent and the supposed underlying mechanisms
improbable at best]{.underline}." Even the iridium anomalies have been
challenged: Bruce Corliss of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute
argues that the [major extinctions associated with the K--T event were
not immediate and catastrophic but "gradual and apparently linked to
progressive climate change]{.underline}."18 [Others argue that a massive
volcanic event predating the]{.underline} Alvarezian [killer asteroid
created an overwhelming greenhouse effect and set the dinosaurs up for
the knockout punch. A considerable number of scientists believe that
gradually changing sea levels were the primary cause of the K--T
Extinction. If either of these hypotheses is true -- and a substantial
number of geologists hold these positions --- then the "killer asteroid"
is getting credit that it does not deserve. Even if the K--T Extinction
was the work of a rock from space]{.underline}, the Alvarez team credits
a "probable interval of 100 million years between collisions with
10-km-diameter objects."19 [The [next rendezvous]{.mark} with
annihilation [won't be]{.mark} overdue [for about 40 million
years.]{.mark} We have time.]{.underline}

Conclusions [[Nuclear explosives]{.mark} comprise the **only present
technology** [capable of deflecting]{.mark} the **most [catastrophic
threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} (4500 m) [with a sufficient change in
velocity to **avert disaster.**]{.underline} In the case of smaller
bodies, [if alternate methods fail or the warning time is too short, the
nuclear option provides **considerable mitigation**]{.underline} when
used only a few years prior to impact. **[[Even for larger
bodies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [the [payload mass]{.mark} necessary for
a successful nuclear burst-driven deflection [is **well within current
launch vehicle capabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [We have now
extended earlier simulations of nuclear deflection to examine the
challenges of a smaller body and potentially **shorter warning
times**]{.underline} (years). We have also included microporosity to
begin to determine when this material property is a sensitive
uncertainty. [We find that a **modest yield standoff burst** can
**fragment** a nonporous rubble structure]{.underline}, but that 16%
porosity resulted in a substantially bound body. This result
demonstrates that the non-porous case presents the highest risk of
fragmentation, but it also suggests that [**[robustly
fragmenting]{.mark}** smaller bodies **[can be accomplished]{.mark}** by
high yield standoff bursts]{.underline}, a strategy which reduces the
extra mass requirements associated with rendezvous missions. This is an
approach that we will study in more detail in the future. Interestingly,
**[even when copious material is ejected]{.underline}**, [as long as the
remaining bound material is imparted with a reasonable speed
change]{.underline}, [the **[mitigation]{.mark}** against an
Apophis-sized object [can be **substantial**]{.mark}]{.underline} (when
done a year before impact). Alternatively, very low yields or large
heights of burst can deflect bodies of this size when there are decades
to impact. [Despite NEO structural and compositional
uncertainties]{.underline}, [**[detailed simulations]{.underline}**
[show]{.underline} ]{.mark}[that nuclear explosives will provide
**considerable protection**]{.underline}. While their use to perturb a
body some decades out remains the more desirable option, [fragmenting
the body **remains a viable back-up option** with **only a few years of
lead-time.**]{.underline}

Meanwhile, many political and public [debates seem]{.underline} to be
primarily [concerned with]{.underline} standard, relatively
[**[short-term]{.mark}**, **economic issues**, such as]{.underline}
monetary losses, **[stop-and-start economic
[growth]{.mark}]{.underline}**, increasing unemployment, falling real
estate prices, failing banks, virtually bankrupt nations, [and **how to
get back on course** to]{.underline} economic [growth]{.underline}. The
standard responses when national governments are struggling to get their
economies healthy again are mostly about inducing more money, austerity
measures, and introducing financial regulations, all often part of a
broader financial--economic logic (Stiglitz 2010). [The dominant focus
on fighting economic]{.underline} deficits and [problems at the expense
of investing in social and ecological deficits---thereby **failing** to
address **persistent problems** in these areas---can be argued to be a
**short-term strategy** to prop up an **inherently unmanageable
system**]{.underline}. Examples are the support of system banks with
public money and the green growth strategy (OECD 2009, 2013a).
Transition theory (Grin et al. 2010, Markard et al. 2012) suggests that
[such short-term fixes are typical]{.underline} regime-based [strategies
to]{.underline} sustain existing structures, cultures, and practices,
and to [[**fend off**]{.mark} the threats of **[more radical systemic
change]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The transition perspective suggests that most regular policy and
governance strategies essentially reproduce existing systems and, by
definition, do not address the root causes of problems that are embedded
in the same structures and cultures that determine how solutions are
framed and implemented. [Such **[path-dependent development]{.mark}**
optimizing **existing institutional structures** [will **inevitably**
lead to **recurring crises** and]{.mark} ultimately a **[more
disruptive]{.mark}**, **shock-wise structural [change]{.mark}** of an
incumbent regime]{.underline}. Transition studies thus argue that
[[solutions that **address symptoms** rather than]{.mark} the
**[underlying]{.mark} structural [causes]{.mark}** tend to **[reinforce
a lock-]{.mark}in** and result in **further emergent
problems**]{.underline} (Rotmans and Loorbach 2010, Schuitmaker 2012).
We argue that the underlying causes and mechanisms of the economic
crises have not been thoroughly analyzed, let alone addressed through
effective policies. In a globalized economy, [fundamental changes will
not likely come from actions by]{.underline} (national)
[governments]{.underline} or incumbent businesses, as these are
inherently intertwined with and dependent upon the currently still
dominant financial-- economic systems and their governance. [The need
for **alternative economic approaches**]{.underline}, discourses, and
systems [is increasingly emphasized]{.underline} (Schor 2010, Simms
2013, Jackson 2013, van den Bergh 2013, Schor and Thompson, 2014). Even
though the benefits of liberalization are still significant, it seems
that [the transfer of control from government to markets has
**substantially diminished possibilities** for top-down policy making,
adding to **brittleness**, **complexity**, and **lock-in**]{.underline}
(Loorbach and LijnisHuffenreuter 2013).

In this paper, we take a transition perspective on transformative social
innovation to conceptualize and map the systemic dynamics that have
caused the [economic [crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as how it
[[influences]{.mark} the dynamics of **[social
transformation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We explore how the economic
[crisis might be considered]{.underline} as [a phase in a **broader
economic transition**]{.underline} and which types of changes coincide
to develop into this direction. [We]{.underline} thus [view]{.underline}
the [economic crisis]{.underline} not as a phenomenon in isolation
within a relatively short time frame, but [as an **intrinsic
part**]{.underline}, or perhaps a symptom, [of **deeper underlying
structural societal changes** over the longer term]{.underline}. The
question we seek to address is how the economic crisis interacts with
broader societal changes as well as which dynamics might accelerate or
hamper more structural (sustainability) transitions. To this end, we ask
when and how a macrolevel or landscape development like the [economic
[crisis **fundamentally changes**]{.mark} the **[dominant]{.mark}
logic**, **rules**, and **[conditions]{.mark}** of incumbent
regimes]{.underline}. In other words, when does a macrodevelopment
become a game changer (cf. Avelino et al. 2014)?

[The paper]{.underline} builds upon theoretical work from the European
FP7 project TRANSIT, which [draws on transition theory to develop an
**empirically grounded theory** on transformative social
innovation]{.underline}. In this paper, we introduce the analytical
perspective that we developed on transformative social innovation and
two empirical examples. Although our analytical perspective suggests
that alternatives and breakthroughs can come from any sector or actor,
in this paper, we focus on the agency of social innovation and
civil-society-led initiatives in providing and producing alternatives.
The paper was developed through a number of iterations, workshops, and
theoretical synthesizing. To develop our arguments, we build upon
insights from sustainability transitions literature (Grin et al. 2010,
Markard et al. 2012), social innovation research (Mulgan 2006, Murray et
al. 2010, Franz et al. 2012, Westley 2013, Moulaert et al. 2013) and
other fields aiming to understand the economic crisis. In addition, [we
include]{.underline} two [empirical cases]{.underline}, transnational
networks of social innovation, time banks, and the transition movement.
For both cases, [we draw upon a general literature review]{.underline}.

The paper is structured as follows. In the next section, "Economic
change or transition?," we introduce the [economic
[crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} as a multifarious phenomenon, how we
understand it from a transition perspective, and how it is understood
from an economist's point of view. We illustrate that it is an ambiguous
phenomenon that is simultaneously seen as part of regular changes in
that it [is part of **disruptive** or **transformative
change**]{.underline}. In the section "Making sense of the economic
crisis?," we present a number of alternative perspectives on the
economic crisis that put forward particular fundamental and systemic
causes of the economic crisis and how these are translated in so called
"narratives of change." In "Transformative social innovations," we
highlight two specific [social innovation initiatives]{.underline}, time
banks and transition towns, which [[have]{.mark} an **evident
[transformative claim]{.mark}** [and **potential**]{.mark}]{.underline},
and reflect upon how [such]{.underline} transformative social
[innovations relate]{.underline} (themselves) [to the economic
crisis]{.underline}. In "Reconceptualizing societal transformations and
the role of the [economic crisis]{.underline}," we synthesize our
findings and argue that the concepts of game changers and narratives
could help to unpack the landscape and better understand how macro- and
microlevels interact to **[trigger transformative changes]{.underline}**
at the mesolevel. In conclusion, we address the need for a better
understanding of the transformative impacts of the different shades of
change (in coevolution) vis-é-vis the restorative dynamics associated
with incumbent regimes.

The good news is that [the inability of traditional]{.underline}
[politics]{.underline} and policies [to address fundamental challenges
has fueled an **extraordinary amount of experimentation** in
communities]{.underline} across the United States and [around the world.
It has also generated **increasing numbers** of]{.underline}
sophisticated and thoughtful [proposals that **build from the bottom**
and begin to suggest **new systemic possibilities**]{.underline} beyond
the failed systems of the past and present. It is becoming possible to
bring together and extend elements of innovative thinking and realworld
practice in key areas to define the underlying structural building
blocks of a range of alternatives capable of rebuilding the basis for
democracy, liberty, equality, sustainability, and community in the
United States in the twenty-first century. Unbeknownst to many,
[**literally [thousands]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} onthe-ground [efforts have
been developing]{.mark}. These include cooperatives, worker-owned
companies, neighborhood corporations, and many little known municipal,
state, and regional efforts. [These]{.mark} emerging economic
alternatives **suggest different ways** in which capital can be held in
common by small and large publics]{.underline}. They include nonprofit
community corporations and land trusts that develop lowincome housing,
as well as community development financial institutions (CDFIs) that
have over \$108 billion in assets under their management.56 Employee
ownership is also on the rise, involving three million more workers than
are members of private sector unions. 57 A third of Americans belong to
cooperatives, including credit unions that serve 107 million people and
manage \$1.3 trillion in assets, almost as much as is managed by Citi.
58 In the public sector, local government economic development programs
invest in local businesses, while municipal enterprises build
infrastructure and provide services, raising revenue and creating
employment, diversifying the base of locally controlled capital. Public
utilities, together with co-ops, make up nearly 90 percent of all
electricity providers and generate over 20 percent of America's
electricity.59 From California to Alabama, public pension assets are
being channeled into job creation and community development.60 Cities
and states are looking to the creation of public banking systems like
that of North Dakota. Trusts that allow for public ownership and
management of natural resources provide revenue streams from capital,
recalling the unjustly neglected ideas of James Meade.61 From parks and
blood banks to libraries and the internet, [commons management systems
can [provide an **expanding zone of decommodification**]{.mark} to
buffer against the market]{.underline}. Public trusts can be extended
into additional domains, from dry land to the electromagnetic spectrum,
underwriting public services or issuing a citizen dividend. Community
land trusts can ensure affordable housing and prevent disruptive
gentrification and speculative real estate bubbles. New public
strategies encompass both democratic public ownership and new planning
capacities and functions. Even experts working on such matters rarely
appreciate the sheer range of activity. [Practical and policy
foundations have been established that offer a **solid basis** for
future expansion. **A body of [hardwon expertise]{.mark}** [is]{.mark}
now [available in each area, along with **support organizations**,
and]{.mark} technical and other **[experts]{.mark}** who have
accumulated a **great deal** of **direct problem-solving
knowledge**.]{.underline} The idea that we need a "new economy"---that
the entire economic system must be radically restructured if critical
social and environmental goals are to be met---runs directly counter to
the American creed that capitalism as we know it is the best, and only
possible, option. [Most of the new projects, ideas, and research efforts
have thus gained traction slowly and with little national attention. But
[in the wake of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**financial crisis**, they
have **proliferated** and earned]{.mark} a **[surprising]{.mark} amount
of [support]{.mark}**]{.underline}---and not only among advocates on the
left. [New terms have begun to **gain currency** in **diverse areas**
with activist groups and constituencies, an indication that the
domination of [traditional thinking may be **starting to
weaken**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus [we encounter the sharing economy,
the caring economy, the provisioning economy, the restorative economy,
the regenerative economy, the sustaining economy, the collaborative
economy, the solidarity economy, the gift economy, the resilient
economy, the steady state economy, the new economy, and many, many
more]{.underline}. There are calls for a Great Transition, or for a
reclamation of the Commons. Creative thinking by researchers and engaged
scholars is also contributing to the ferment, and policies at the state
and local level can help move projects to much more powerful scale and
community-wide impact. [Larger scale strategic options that build on
what is being learned locally are beginning to be **sketched as the
basis** for **longer-term national strategies**.]{.underline} The press
covers very little of this, but [the various]{.underline} institutional
[efforts have begun to develop new strategies that suggest broader
possibilities for change]{.underline}. One promising model builds on
work in Cleveland, Ohio, where a linked group of workerowned companies
has developed, supported in part by the massive purchasing power of
local hospitals and universities. These cooperative firms include a
solar installation and weatherization company, an industrial scale
ecologically advanced laundry, and a greenhouse capable of producing
over three million heads of lettuce and 300,000 pounds of herbs a
year.62 This effort, modeled in part on the 74,000-person Mondragón
cooperative network in the Basque region of Spain, will create new
businesses, as time goes on.63 However, its goal is not simply worker
ownership, but the democratization of wealth and sustainable community
building in general in an extremely poor neighborhood of what was once a
thriving industrial city. Linked by a community-serving non-profit
corporation and a revolving fund, the companies cannot be sold outside
the network; they also return ten percent of their profits to help
develop additional worker-owned firms and grow the network. Cities
across the United States---and overseas as well---are looking to the
Cleveland Model as an inspiration for their own community wealth
building efforts. A critical element of the overall sustainability
strategy points to what is essentially a quasi-public community
stabilizing planning model. Hospitals and universities in the area
currently spend \$3 billion a year on goods and services---none, until
recently, purchased from the immediately surrounding neighborhood. The
Cleveland Model is supported in part by decisions of these substantially
publicly financed institutions to allocate part of their procurement to
the worker-coops in support of a larger community-building agenda. The
taxpayer funds that support institutions of this kind thereby do double
duty by helping to support the broader community through the new
localized purchasing arrangements. The same is true for a range of
municipal, state, and other federal policies available to local
businesses, including employee-owned firms. Note carefully that such
stabilization also undercuts the growth imperative---and suggests
principles that can also be applied at higher levels. Such approaches
cannot claim to provide all the answers. But [a number of exploratory
efforts emphasize **fundamental changes** in underlying
political-economic institutions]{.underline}. Developing detailed and
sophisticated alternatives that can be refined over time is a
prerequisite if we are to stimulate a serious and wide-ranging debate
around a broader menu of institutional possibilities for future
development than the narrow range of choices commonly discussed. The
need for a major change of direction is increasingly obvious. Efforts to
cobble together "solutions" to today's challenges commonly draw upon the
very same institutional arrangements and practices that gave rise to the
problems in the first place. What is required is a self-conscious effort
to face the fact that the system itself has to be changed and a
different kind of political economy created. Although precisely what
"changing the system" means is obviously a matter of debate, certain key
points are clear. The [[new movements seek a
cooperative]{.underline}]{.mark}, caring and community-nurturing
[[economy]{.mark} that is ecologically sustainable, equitable, and
socially responsible]{.underline}---one that is [[based
on]{.underline}]{.mark} rethinking and democratizing the nature of
ownership at every level and, along with this, **[[challenging]{.mark}
the [growth]{.mark} paradigm]{.underline}** that is the underlying
assumption of all conventional policies. In short, these movements seek
an economy that gives true priority to people, place, and planet. Such
an economy, so different from our own, requires a new vocabulary, beyond
the narrow choice between "capitalism" and "socialism." It's easy to
overestimate the possibilities. Emerging ideas and institutional
explorations are limited compared with the power of Wall Street banks
and the other corporate giants of the American economy. On the other
hand, [precisely because the existing structures of power have created
enormous economic problems and fueled public anger, the opportunity for
a **more profound shift** exists. Unexpectedly rapid change is **not out
of the question**]{.underline}. We have already seen how, in [moments of
crisis]{.underline}, the nationalization of auto giants like General
Motors and Chrysler can suddenly become a reality. Such crises [are
**likely to be repeated in the future**]{.underline}, possibly [with
**more far reaching outcomes** over time. [When the **next financial
breakdown** occurs]{.mark}]{.underline}, huge injections of public money
may well lead to the breakup or de facto takeover of major financial
institutions. At the same time, [various [forms of **larger**]{.mark}
**institutional [experimentation]{.mark}**[---and **pressure**]{.mark}
**for further experimentation**---[are]{.mark} also **[clearly in the
cards]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

#### Even if there's resistance, the transition is forced

David **Holmgren 13**, founder of Holmgren Design Services, an
environmental design and consulting firm, inventor of the Permaculture
system for regenerative agriculture, 2013, "Crash on Demand: Welcome to
the Brown Tech Future," Simplicity Institute report,
<http://simplicityinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/CrashOnDemandSimplicityInstitute.pdf>

The evidence that [the global financial system is a]{.underline}
[not-so-slow moving train crash]{.underline} is getting stronger. That
investors and the billion or so middle class people who have any savings
and discretionary expenditure are losing faith, might be an
understatement. It may be that paralysis and [inertia is all that is
holding the system together]{.underline}. [A [collapse]{.mark} in credit
could [make it]{.mark}]{.underline} [very [difficult to raise]{.mark}
the [finance]{.mark}]{.underline} [[necessary for]{.mark}
the]{.underline} [ongoing extraction of tar sands, shale
gas]{.underline} [and other mad resource [extraction projects]{.mark}
that are]{.underline} [[accelerating]{.mark} the production
of]{.underline} GGE\[Greenhouse Gas [[Emissions]{.mark}\]]{.underline}.
[A deflationary spiral that follows from a credit crisis and collapsing
asset]{.underline} (housing, etc.) [values could]{.underline} [change
behaviour]{.underline} [to the extent that people stop spending on
anything but essentials]{.underline} because of job insecurity and the
fact that everything will be cheaper next month. I believe the chances
of global economic collapse (in the next five years) being severe enough
to achieve this have to be rated at least 50%. Further I believe many
climate activists and policy professionals are shifting to at least
privately hoping this might be the case because the chances of a planned
powerdown seems to be fading. If we accept [[a]{.mark} global [financial
crash could make it]{.mark}]{.underline} [very difficult, if
not]{.underline} [[impossible]{.mark}, [to restart the]{.mark} global
[economy with anything other than]{.mark}]{.underline} [[drastically
reduced emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}, then [[an argument can be
mounted for putting effort into]{.underline}]{.mark} [precipitating
[that crash]{.mark}, the crash of the financial system]{.underline}. Any
such plan would of course invite being blamed for causing it when it
happens. No one wants to be strung up along with the bankers for causing
a global version of Greece, Egypt or many other countries, let alone the
horrors of Syria. On the other hand, we have no precedent to indicate
how bad conditions might be in currently affluent countries. The picture
I am building is that it is almost inevitable that those who warn of the
crisis will get the blame for causing it. So if we are going to be
blamed anyway, [[we could]{.mark} be proactive about it and]{.underline}
at least [[get the advantage for humanity of crisis now, rather than
later]{.underline}]{.mark}. For the people of Syria caught in the grip
of climate, energy and geopolitical struggle, all this hardly matters
because it couldn\'t get worse for them. In fact conditions in such
stricken places could actually improve if global superpower competition
is disabled by the collapse of the global finance. Even the average
citizen in Greece or Egypt might be hoping to see the remaining affluent
countries get a \'taste of their own medicine\'. The complexity of
global human overshoot, so long predicted, and now unfolding, is far too
multifaceted to be captured by any simple story about good, innocence,
evil and blame. Before considering whether this is a good idea or not, I
want to consider whether concerted action by limited numbers of
activists could bring it about? Given the current fragilities of global
finance, I believe a radical change in the behaviour of a relatively
small proportion of the global middle class could precipitate such a
crash. For example a 50% reduction of consumption and 50% conversion of
assets into building household and local community resilience by say 10%
of the population in affluent countries would show up as 5% reduction in
demand in a system built on perpetual growth and a 5% reduction in
savings capital available for banks to lend. Small fluctuations in the
supply-demand balance can have a massive effect on prices. Further,
[when the system has been growing due to rising debt]{.underline},
arguably for decades, [then the vulnerability to drops in demand can be
massive]{.underline}. For example, small drops in demand for new houses
and the high fuel costs of commuting for those servicing mortgages,
triggered the collapse of the housing bubble in the USA and other
countries. It seems obvious to me that it is easier to convince a
minority that they will be better off by disengaging from the system
than any efforts to build mass movements demanding impossible outcomes
or convincing elites to turn off the system that is currently keeping
them in power. I accept that many people find the idea of assisting
economic collapse abhorrent, even if that collapse is becoming more and
more likely as a collective outcome of human actions. Daryl Taylor uses
the caring metaphor \"hospicing and euthanasing\" the old/dying system
along with \"doula-ing and midwifing the new/emerging system. Whatever
the metaphors, climate activists who believe [we are on the verge
of]{.underline} [runaway catastrophic [climate change]{.mark} that [will
be]{.mark} far [worse than]{.mark} simply [stalling]{.mark} [the
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} do have options other than
shouting louder for mitigation or shifting to adaptation and defence.
Rather than simply planning for bad and rocky energy descent delivered
initially by economic depression, they could choose to focus their
energy on actively trying to destroy faith in the financial system.

### AT: Developing Countries\-\--2NC

#### Degrowth is especially effective with developing countries

06/2017. "Can Degrowth Rescue Sub-Saharan Africa?" International Journal
of Technology Management & Sustainable Development, vol. 16, no. 2, pp.
191--200.

[The idea of 'lesser consumption' that the Degrowth movement supports is
not compatible with the politics of poverty that the **Global
North**]{.underline} (Kegley 2008) [has tried to implement in
eradicating poverty and inequality in the poorest region of the
world]{.underline}. The concept of lesser consumption cannot possibly be
referring to this region (as mentioned earlier in the article, a large
share of the population still lives under \$1.25 a day) as it is, but to
the more developed countries of the Global North. [One of the schemes
that support the Degrowth claims that [the **North should**]{.mark}
**start [reduc]{.mark}ing [economic growth]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
order [[to allow for **space**]{.mark} **in the biosphere** [as the
**South starts**]{.mark} **its economic growth stage**]{.underline}
(Demaria et al. 2014). [What we have witnessed in the past decade is
that politics in the international system have delayed solutions to
climate change and have exacerbated the damage caused to the environment
while the world's 'sweatshops']{.underline} -- referring to [**India and
China** -- arduously delay participation in a global climate change
agreement]{.underline} (Oatley, 2013). [The argument is that this would
cause a reduction in]{.underline} economic [growth]{.underline} for
China and India and drive foreign capital out of the country. [They
claim that they have the right to continue growing because the United
States and Western Europe grew without having any limits on their growth
levels]{.underline}. If it took such a long time to get a potential
agreement between these global powers,11 [we can only estimate the
**incredibly long time** it would take to **educate the developing
Global South to follow a path towards an imaginary 'sustainable
growth'**]{.underline} (Demaria et al. 2014). **[Regardless of the
efficiency we achieve]{.underline}** by each new development ([without
bringing **Jevon's paradox** to light]{.underline}), [the amount of
biosphere saved by a Degrowth of the Global North would never match the
amount of waste a growing Global South would generate]{.underline}. And
this is simply taking into account the lack of energy efficiency and the
sheer size of the population that will be ready to consume. It is
startling to find that the fastest growing economies are not those in
developing countries but in the already developed economies, which makes
the idea of a North slowdown even harder to believe. A strategy we came
across as part of the suggested principles of Degrowth was the use of
basic and/or ceiling income for citizens (Demaria et al. 2014). It would
be very hard to imagine both of these policies featured in the property
and taxation systems of developed countries. Unless we manage to
decolonize the imagination of society members into not needing to
accumulate wealth and not needing to consume so much, it would be
impossible to vote these policies into law. People would not find the
basic income policy troubling because that would be in direct
confrontation with poverty, but if we are to embrace the maximum income
policy it would require quite a restructuring of the existing system.
For a moment let us assume that we overrun the institutional
complications and manage to establish the maximum income policy into law
and the earnings from this policy would go to fund the basic income for
the rest of the population. The fundamentals of economics teach us that
people will not work as hard if they have a guaranteed basic income,
which poses a serious threat to Degrowth. Citizens could be spending
this money on importing products or travel, and thus the money will
leave the country. The only way for the government to continue this
programme would be to either produce new money (inflation and
hyperinflation as was the case in Zimbabwe (The Economist 2013)) or
promote economic growth. Assuming for argument's sake that it would not
place a problem on the financial feasibility of the programme, this
formulation would collapse the innovation and research structures
because much of the research conducted nowadays is to provide affordable
products to the much larger lower income class and provide high-income
citizens with exclusive products and services. The reduction in
consumption of the 'high-income' class will not be enough to account for
the increase in consumption of the lower-income class. When the latter
class does not exist anymore, incentives to invest into such research
would diminish. But this presents an even greater problem because we end
up with more people who can afford products they could not before.12 A
surge in consumption and production would follow. This means that we
would see Jevon's13 paradox in reverse as new inventions are created
more slowly and consumption for such products diminishes when more
expensive products can be afforded. Basic income would be very
beneficial to Africa at first because poverty and inequality would be
addressed immediately, but with its current economy it would be
difficult to imagine this sudden growth in income without an increase in
consumption that would exacerbate their ecosystem. A system that runs on
these two principles will only see higher consumption levels. [Many

considered the world's most effective public health intervention (Chari
and Corbridge 2008). The two most influential international agencies in
advising developing countries, IMF and the World Bank, currently place
more emphasis on institutional reforms such as overhauling a nation's
civil service or its tax administration than on technologies needed to
fight tropical diseases and low agricultural productivity (Frieden et
al. 2009). [Growing economies of [the North **demand resources**]{.mark}
**increasingly**]{.underline}. [As western Corporations seek to expand
commodity frontiers by using supplies and resources of the African
continent, [it]{.mark} **further [harms the African
environment]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and reduces]{.underline} deposits of
**[resources]{.underline}** [for the local inhabitants to use in the
future. The biggest challenge]{.underline} that modern societies face
[is]{.underline} in finding sources for its **[energy]{.underline}**
needs. Africa has 8 per cent of the world's fossil fuel reserves and
leads in underground resources for only ten of the 100 most used and
rare minerals, thus it needs to rethink how it allows the northern
corporations extract these resources (Simons 2013). African countries in
Sub-Saharan Africa have difficult challenges ahead of them, the most
important ones being the reduction of inequality and poverty,
eradication of diseases and finding/exploiting renewable energy sources
to support their development. According to several research studies,
Sub-Saharan Africa can power their entire region on renewable energy
(IRENA 2014). Just a fraction of the sunlight that falls on the Sahara
desert can satisfy all of the continent's energy needs now and in the
near future, and this is a resource that cannot be exploited by foreign
multinationals because energy transportation to other continents is not
feasible due to high costs (Taplin 2013). Tapping these resources has
the benefit of not allowing African governments to turn into rentier
states14 because they cannot export this resource too far from the
region. Thus it will boost both economic growth and directly confront
the challenges faced by the poorer populations without needing to become
the world's next 'sweatshop'. The geographical advantage of the region
with respect to renewable energy production can only be amplified
through innovation. Thus, investment in regionwide education is highly
recommended. Africa does not need to look at the northern economies as
models after which to design their countries, but instead they need to
employ strategies that are best suited to their tropical and subtropical
environment. Almost none of the programmes that have been established in
the West will be effective in this region, including water supply and
sanitation. Africa does not need to reinvent western programmes to
improve outcomes of health, education, or family planning, but it needs
to use design-thinking strategies to create programmes that would be
specific to every region and would accommodate for changes that climate
change will bring (Brown, 2008) As the world runs after energy, Africa
needs to seize the opportunity and create energy from the renewable
resources it has been bestowed with. These sources have the highest
Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROI) among all renewables. But the
path will not be so easy for the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Climate change will be harsh on the region and it has the potential to
undo the progress that has been achieved until now with respect to the
reduction of poverty and disease prevention. [[Degrowth]{.mark} offers a
framework that is **difficult to be accepted and implemented in the
Global North**]{.underline} due to the perception of consumption that is
unlikely to change, [but it [can]{.mark} surely [find space]{.mark} for
certain principles of it [in **Africa**]{.mark}]{.underline}. After
examining the use of GDP as a measure of economic growth and development
for a country, we came to the conclusion that it is deeply misleading
since it does not portray any sort of development or real growth. Use of
other biophysical and social indicators (Demaria et al. 2014) to denote
growth and development would help agencies address problems easier as
they become more evident and better studied. The other two principles
that we assessed in this article were 'basic' and 'ceiling' income.
Although a largely difficult system to implement because of the
necessary changes and uncertainties in the new redistribution system, it
would be the most direct way to confront poverty in Africa. The main
issue we found with these two principles was a reversal of Jevon's
paradox as invention occurs at a slower rate and that eventually only
economic growth and constant consumption would maintain such a system.

[The no-rubble simulation produces]{.underline} a [significantly more
intense fire]{.underline}, [with more]{.underline} fire
[spread]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} consequently [a significantly
stronger plume with larger amounts of BC reaching into the upper
atmosphere]{.underline} than the simulation with rubble, illustrated in
Figure 5. [While the no-rubble simulation **represents [the worst-case
scenario]{.mark}** involving vigorous fire activity]{.underline},
[**[only a relatively small amount of carbon makes its way into the
stratosphere]{.mark}**]{.underline} during the course of the simulation.
But while small compared to the surface BC mass, stratospheric BC
amounts from the current simulations are significantly higher than what
would be expected from burning vegetation such as trees (Heilman et al.,
2014), e.g., the higher energy density of the building fuels and the
initial fluence from the weapon produce an intense response within
HIGRAD with initial updrafts of order 100 m/s in the lower troposphere.
Or, in comparison to a mass fire, wildfires will burn only a small
amount of fuel in the corresponding time period (roughly 10 minutes)
that a nuclear weapon fluence can effectively ignite a large area of
fuel producing an impressive atmospheric response. Figure 6 shows
[vertical profiles of BC]{.underline} multiplied by 100 (number of
cities involved in the exchange) from the two simulations. The total
amount of BC produced is in line with previous estimates (about 3.69 Tg
from no-rubble simulation); however, the majority of BC
[reside]{.underline}s **[below the stratosphere]{.underline}** (3.46 Tg
below 12 km) [and can be **readily impacted by scavenging from
precipitation** either via pyro-cumulonimbus produced by the fire
itself]{.underline} (not modeled) [or other synoptic weather
systems]{.underline}. While the impact on climate of these more
realistic profiles will be explored in the next section, it should be
mentioned that [**[these estimates are]{.mark} still [at the high
end]{.mark}**, [considering the inherent simplifications]{.mark} in the
combustion model [that lead to **overestimating BC
production**]{.mark}.]{.underline} 3.3 Climate Results [Long-term
[climatic effects]{.mark} critically [depend on]{.mark}]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} initial injection [[height]{.mark} of the soot, with
larger quantities reaching the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere
inducing a greater cooling impact because of longer residence
times]{.underline} (Robock et al., 2007a). Absorption of solar radiation
by the BC aerosol and its subsequent radiative cooling tends to heat the
surrounding air, driving an initial upward diffusion of the soot plumes,
an effect that depends on the initial aerosol concentrations. [**[Mixing
and sedimentation]{.mark}**]{.underline} tend to [[**reduce this
process**, and low altitude emissions are]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[[significantly impacted by precipitation]{.underline}]{.mark} if aging
of the BC aerosol occurs on sufficiently rapid timescales. But once at
stratospheric altitudes, aerosol dilution via coagulation is hindered by
low particulate concentrations (e.g., Robock et al., 2007a) and lofting
to much higher altitudes is inhibited by gravitational settling in the
low-density air (Stenke et al., 2013), resulting in more stable BC
concentrations over long times. [[Of the initial BC]{.mark}]{.underline}
mass [released in the atmosphere]{.underline}, most of which is emitted
below 9 km, [**[70% rains out within the first month]{.mark}** and
78%]{.underline}, or about 2.9 Tg, [is removed within the first two
months]{.underline} (Figure 7, solid line), with the remainder (about
0.8 Tg, dashed line) being transported above about 12 km (200 hPa)
within the first week. This outcome differs from the findings of, e.g.,
Stenke et al. (2013, their high BC-load cases) and Mills et al. (2014),
who found that most of the BC mass (between 60 and 70%) is lifted in the
stratosphere within the first couple of weeks. This can also be seen in
Figure 8 (red lines) and in Figure 9, which include results from our
calculation with the initial BC distribution from Mills et al. (2014).
In that case, only 30% of the initial BC mass rains out in the
troposphere during the first two weeks after the exchange, with the
remainder rising to the stratosphere. In the study of Mills et al.
(2008) this percentage is somewhat smaller, about 20%, and smaller still
in the experiments of Robock et al. (2007a) in which the soot is
initially emitted in the upper troposphere or higher. In Figure 7, the
e-folding timescale for the removal of tropospheric soot, here
interpreted as the time required for an initial drop of a factor e, is
about one week. This result compares favorably with the "LT" experiment
of Robock et al. (2007a), considering 5 Tg of BC released in the lower
troposphere, in which 50% of the aerosols are removed within two weeks.
By contrast, the initial e-folding timescale for the removal of
stratospheric soot in Figure 8 is about 4.2 years (blue solid line),
compared to about 8.4 years for the calculation using Mills et al.
(2014) initial BC emission (red solid line). The removal timescale from
our forced ensemble simulations is close to those obtained by Mills et
al. (2008) in their 1 Tg experiment, by Robock et al. (2007a) in their
experiment "UT 1 Tg", and © 2018 American Geophysical Union. All rights
reserved. by Stenke et al. (2013) in their experiment "Exp1", in all of
which 1 Tg of soot was emitted in the atmosphere in the aftermath of the
exchange. Notably, the e-folding timescale for the decline of the BC
mass in Figure 8 (blue solid line) is also close to the value of about 4
years quoted by Pausata et al. (2016) for their long-term "intermediate"
scenario. In that scenario, which is also based on 5 Tg of soot
initially distributed as in Mills et al. (2014), the factor-of2 shorter
residence time of the aerosols is caused by particle growth via
coagulation of BC with organic carbon. Figure 9 shows the BC mass-mixing
ratio, horizontally averaged over the globe, as a function of
atmospheric pressure (height) and time. [The BC
distributions]{.underline} used [in]{.underline} our
[simulations]{.underline} [imply that]{.underline} the [upward transport
of particles]{.underline} [is substantially less efficient compared to
the case in]{.underline} [which]{.underline} 5 Tg of [BC is directly
injected into the upper troposphere]{.underline}. The semiannual cycle
of lofting and sinking of the aerosols is associated with atmospheric
heating and cooling during the solstice in each hemisphere (Robock et
al., 2007a). During the first year, the oscillation amplitude in our
forced ensemble simulations is particularly large during the summer
solstice, compared to that during the winter solstice (see bottom panel
of Figure 9), because of the higher soot concentrations in the Northern
Hemisphere, as can be seen in Figure 11 (see also left panel of Figure
12). Comparing the top and bottom panels of Figure 9, the BC reaches the
highest altitudes during the first year in both cases, but the
concentrations at 0.1 hPa in the top panel can be 200 times as large.
Qualitatively, [the difference can be understood in terms of the air
temperature increase caused by BC radiation emission]{.underline},
[which is several tens of kelvin degrees in]{.underline} the
[simulations]{.underline} [of Robock]{.underline} et al. (2007a, see
their Figure 4), [Mills]{.underline} et al. (2008, see their Figure 5),
[Stenke]{.underline} et al. (2013, see high-load cases in their Figure
4), Mills et al. (2014, see their Figure 7), [and Pausata]{.underline}
et al. (2016, see one-day emission cases in their Figure 1), [due to
high BC concentrations, but]{.underline} it [amounts to only about 10 K
in our]{.underline} forced [ensemble simulations]{.underline}, as
illustrated in Figure 10. Results similar to those presented in Figure
10 were obtained from the experiment "Exp1" performed by Stenke et al.
(2013, see their Figure 4). [**In that scenario as well, somewhat less
that 1 Tg of BC remained in the atmosphere after the initial
rainout**.]{.underline} As mentioned before, the BC aerosol that remains
in the atmosphere, lifted to stratospheric heights by the rising soot
plumes, undergoes sedimentation over a timescale of several years
(Figures 8 and 9). This mass represents the effective amount of BC that
can force climatic changes over multi-year timescales. In the forced
ensemble simulations, it is about 0.8 Tg after the initial rainout,
whereas it is about 3.4 Tg in the simulation with an initial soot
distribution as in Mills et al. (2014). Our more realistic source
simulation involves the worstcase assumption of no-rubble (along with
other assumptions) and hence serves as an upper bound for the impact on
climate. As mentioned above and further discussed below, our scenario
induces perturbations on the climate system similar to those found in
previous studies in which the climatic response was driven by roughly 1
Tg of soot rising to stratospheric heights following the exchange.
Figure 11 illustrates the vertically integrated mass-mixing ratio of BC
over the globe, at various times after the exchange for the simulation
using the initial BC distribution of Mills et al. (2014, upper panels)
and as an average from the forced ensemble members (lower panels). All
simulations predict enhanced concentrations at high latitudes during the
first year after the exchange. In the cases shown in the top panels,
however, these high concentrations persist for several years (see also
Figure 1 of Mills et al., 2014), whereas the forced ensemble simulations
indicate that the BC concentration starts to decline after the first
year. In fact, in the simulation represented in the top panels,
mass-mixing ratios larger than about 1 kg of BC © 2018 American
Geophysical Union. All rights reserved. per Tg of air persist for well
over 10 years after the exchange, whereas they only last for 3 years in
our forced simulations (compare top and middle panels of Figure 9).
After the first year, values drop below 3 kg BC/Tg air, whereas it takes
about 8 years to reach these values in the simulation in the top panels
(see also Robock et al., 2007a). Over crop-producing, midlatitude
regions in the Northern Hemisphere, the BC loading is reduced from more
than 0.8 kg BC/Tg air in the simulation in the top panels to 0.2-0.4 kg
BC/Tg air in our forced simulations (see middle and right panels). The
more rapid clearing of the atmosphere in the forced ensemble is also
signaled by the soot optical depth in the visible radiation spectrum,
which drops below values of 0.03 toward the second half of the first
year at mid latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, and everywhere on the
globe after about 2.5 years (without never attaining this value in the
Southern Hemisphere). In contrast, the soot optical depth in the
calculation shown in the top panels of Figure 11 becomes smaller than
0.03 everywhere only after about 10 years. The two cases show a similar
tendency, in that the BC optical depth is typically lower between
latitudes 30º S-30º N than it is at other latitudes. This behavior is
associated to the persistence of stratospheric soot toward
high-latitudes and the Arctic/Antarctic regions, as illustrated by the
zonally-averaged, column-integrated mass-mixing ratio of the BC in
Figure 12 for both the forced ensemble simulations (left panel) and the
simulation with an initial 5 Tg BC emission in the upper troposphere
(right panel). The spread in the globally averaged (near) surface
temperature of the atmosphere, from the control (left panel) and forced
(right panel) ensembles, is displayed in Figure 13. For each month, the
plots show the largest variations (i.e., maximum and minimum values),
within each ensemble of values obtained for that month, relative to the
mean value of that month. The plot also shows yearly-averaged data
(thinner lines). The spread is comparable in the control and forced
ensembles, with average values calculated over the 33-years run length
of 0.4-0.5 K. This spread is also similar to the internal variability of
the globally averaged surface temperature quoted for the NCAR Large
Ensemble Community Project (Kay et al., 2015). These results imply that
surface air temperature differences, between forced and control
simulations, which lie within the spread may not be distinguished from
effects due to internal variability of the two simulation ensembles.
Figure 14 shows the difference in the globally averaged surface
temperature of the atmosphere (top panel), net solar radiation flux at
surface (middle panel), and precipitation rate (bottom panel), computed
as the (forced minus control) difference in ensemble mean values. The
sum of standard deviations from each ensemble is shaded. Differences are
qualitatively significant over the first few years, when the anomalies
lie near or outside the total standard deviation. Inside the shaded
region, differences may not be distinguished from those arising from the
internal variability of one or both ensembles. The surface solar flux
(middle panel) is the quantity that appears most affected by the BC
emission, with qualitatively significant differences persisting for
about 5 years. The precipitation rate (bottom panel) is instead affected
only at the very beginning of the simulations. The red lines in all
panels show the results from the simulation applying the initial BC
distribution of Mills et al. (2014), where the period of significant
impact is much longer owing to the higher altitude of the initial soot
distribution that results in longer residence times of the BC aerosol in
the atmosphere. When yearly averages of the same quantities are
performed over the IndiaPakistan region, the differences in ensemble
mean values lie within the total standard deviations of the two
ensembles. The results in Figure 14 can also be compared to the outcomes
of other previous studies. In their experiment "UT 1 Tg", Robock et al.
(2007a) found that, when only 1 Tg of soot © 2018 American Geophysical
Union. All rights reserved. remains in the atmosphere after the initial
rainout, temperature and precipitation anomalies are about 20% of those
obtained from their standard 5 Tg BC emission case. Therefore, the
largest differences they observed, during the first few years after the
exchange, were about - 0.3 K and -0.06 mm/day, respectively, comparable
to the anomalies in the top and bottom panels of Figure 14. Their
standard 5 Tg emission case resulted in a solar radiation flux anomaly
at surface of -12 W/m2 after the second year (see their Figure 3),
between 5 and 6 time as large as the corresponding anomalies from our
ensembles shown in the middle panel. In their experiment "Exp1", Stenke
et al. (2013) reported global mean surface temperature anomalies not
exceeding about 0.3 K in magnitude and precipitation anomalies hovering
around -0.07 mm/day during the first few years, again consistent with
the results of Figure 14. In a recent study, Pausata et al. (2016)
considered the effects of an admixture of BC and organic carbon
aerosols, both of which would be emitted in the atmosphere in the
aftermath of a nuclear exchange. In particular, they concentrated on the
effects of coagulation of these aerosol species and examined their
climatic impacts. The initial BC distribution was as in Mills et al.
(2014), although the soot burden was released in the atmosphere over
time periods of various lengths. Most relevant to our and other previous
work are their one-day emission scenarios. They found that, during the
first year, the largest values of the atmospheric surface temperature
anomalies ranged between about -0.5 and -1.3 K, those of the sea surface
temperature anomalies ranged between -0.2 and -0.55 K, and those of the
precipitation anomalies varied between -0.15 and -0.2 mm/day. All these
ranges are compatible with our results shown in Figure 14 as red lines
and with those of Mills et al. (2014, see their Figures 3 and 6). As
already mentioned in Section 2.3, the net solar flux anomalies at
surface are also consistent. [This]{.underline} overall agreement
[suggests that [the **inclusion of organic carbon aerosols**]{.mark}**,
and** ensuing **coagulation** with BC, **[should not dramatically alter
the climatic effects]{.mark}** resulting from our forced ensemble
simulations. Moreover, [aerosol growth]{.mark} would likely **[shorten
the residence time of the BC]{.mark} particulate in the

of increased humidity and temperature may increase the wet bulb

near-term risks, like unemployment, nor remote risks, like AI
superintelligence. But a large drone army -- if one were produced --
could receive a wrong command or be infected by a computer virus,
leading it to attack people indiscriminately. Remote islands without
robots could provide protection in this case, allowing survival until
such a drone army ran out of batteries, fuel, ammunition or other

[In the case of]{.underline} high altitude [[nuclear bursts]{.mark},
two]{.underline} main [EMP types come into play]{.underline}, ["fast
pulse" and]{.underline} the ["slow pulse."]{.underline} The fast pulse
EMP field is created by gamma ray interaction with stratospheric air
molecules. It peaks at tens of kilovolts per meter in a few nanoseconds,
and lasts for a few hundred nanoseconds. The broad-band frequency
content of (0-1000 megahertz) enables it to couple to electrical and
electronic systems in general, regardless of the length of their
penetrating cables and antenna lines. Induced currents range into the
1,000s of amperes. The "slow pulse" EMP is caused by the distortion of
the earth's magnetic field lines due to the expanding nuclear fireball
and rising of heated and ionized layers of the ionosphere. These
[effects are limited to Earth\'s Ionosphere]{.underline}, a range of
altitude between 50 and 600 miles above the earth's surface. The
strength of EMP's are limited bt the Gamma ray release of the nuclear
explosion. [A bomb not specifically designed to enhance this will [not
normally result in a high field strength value and **the EMP will do
little permanent as a result.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

As an example, [the chart above shows the effect of prompt Gamma ray
output and how it affects field strength.]{.underline} \[67\] [The 1.4
MT Starfish Prime test produced a 1.4kt prompt Gamma Ray]{.underline}

[This is]{.underline} about [the minimum energy needed to do substantial
damage to a country\'s electrical systems but even at that level **many
things would be left unharmed** as the danger diminishes with distance.
Starfish produced the largest fields]{.underline} of the high-altitude
detonations; [they caused outages of the]{.underline} series-connected
[street-lighting systems]{.underline} of Oahu (Hawaii), [probable
failure of a microwave repeating station on Kauai]{.underline}, [failure
of the input stages]{.underline} of ionospheric sounders [and damage to
rectifiers]{.underline} in communication receivers, Other than the
failure of the microwave link, no problem was noted in the telephone
system. No failure was noted in the telemetry systems used for data
transmission on board the many instrumentation rockets. [There was [no
apparent increase in radio or television repairs]{.mark}]{.underline}
subsequent to any of the Johnson Island detonations. [The [failures
observed were generally in the unprotected input stages of

transients on the power line probably caused the rectifier failures.
There was one failure in the unprotected part of an electronic system of

DoD EMP SIMULATIONS TESTS [[We tested]{.mark}]{.underline} a sample of
[[37 cars in an EMP simulation]{.mark} laboratory]{.underline}, with
automobile vintages ranging from 1986 through 2002. \... [The most
[serious effect observed on running automobiles was that the motors in
three cars stopped]{.mark} at]{.underline} field strengths of
approximately [30 kV/m or above]{.underline}. [In an actual EMP
exposure, these vehicles would glide to a stop and require the driver to
restart them.]{.underline} Electronics in the dashboard of one
automobile were damaged and required repair. [Based on these test
results, we expect few automobile effects at EMP field levels below 25
kV/m]{.underline}. Approximately 10 percent or more of the automobiles
exposed to higher field levels may experience serious EMP effects,
including engine stall, that require driver intervention to correct.
[Five of the 18 trucks tested did not exhibit any anomalous response up
to]{.underline} field strengths of approximately [50 kV/m. Based on
these test results, we expect few truck effects at EMP field levels
below approximately 12 kV/m]{.underline}. At higher field levels, 70
percent or more of the trucks on the road will manifest some anomalous
response following EMP exposure. Approximately 15 percent or more of the
trucks will experience engine stall, sometimes with permanent damage
that the driver cannot correct. Results indicate that some computer
failures can be expected at relatively low EMP field levels of 3 to 6
kilovolts per meter (kV/m). At higher field levels, additional failures
are likely in computers, routers, network switches, and keyboards
embedded in the computer-aided dispatch, public safety radio, and mobile
data communications equipment. \... none of the radios showed any damage
with EMP fields up to 50 kV/m. While many of the operating radios
experienced latching upsets at 50 kV/m field levels, these were
correctable by turning power off and then on.\[69\] [[Contrary
to]{.mark} many [sensational headlines, **the US Military is well
protected from most EMP's**. ]{.mark}]{.underline}For decades now the
military has defined systems around survivability. The details of such
are contained here: E.6 Military Standards [DTRA]{.underline} and its
predecessor agencies have [developed, and regularly update]{.underline},
[military standards]{.underline} (MIL-STDs) [designed to aid
in]{.underline} the design, development, test, and evaluation of [DoD
systems subjected to nuclear and EMP environments. These MIL-STDs cover
nuclear-generated **EMP survivability of aircraft, maritime, and other
systems** in coordination with the Air Force and the Navy]{.underline},
as well as the broader community of stakeholders. The following are some
of the relevant MIL-STDs: [MIL-STD-1766]{.underline}, Nuclear Hardness
and Survivability Program Requirements for ICBM Weapon Systems [defines
nuclear hardness and survivability requirements and practices for use
during]{.underline} the concept exploration, demonstration and
validation, full-scale development, [production, and
deployment]{.underline} phases [of]{.underline} the acquisition
life-cycle of [ICBM weapon systems. MIL-STD-2169C]{.underline}, HEMP
Environment Standard (Classified) [defines high-altitude EMP
environments for]{.underline} system hardness [design and
testing]{.underline}. [MIL-STD-3023,]{.underline} HEMP Protection for
Military Aircraft [establishes]{.underline} design margin, [performance
metrics, and]{.underline} test [protocols for]{.underline} HEMP
[protection of military aircraft with nuclear EMP
survivability]{.underline} at three hardness levels. This MIL-STD may
also be used for aircraft that support multiple missions. Subsystems of
the aircraft required to fully comply with the provisions of the
standard are designated as Mission-Critical Subsystems having a HEMP
survivability requirement. This approach also allows for consideration
of platforms not yet addressed in this standard, such as Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles. MIL-STD-188-125, HEMP Protection for Ground-Based C4I
Facilities Performing Critical, Time Urgent Missions is in the process
of being updated. DTRA is investigating present capabilities and
shortfalls of power filters as well as utilizing test results from EMP
simulators. [MIL-STD-4023]{.underline}, Maritime EMP Standard
[establishes performance metrics]{.underline}, test protocols, and
hardness margin levels [for HEMP protection of military surface
ships]{.underline} that must function when subjected to a HEMP
environment. Satellite System Nuclear Survivability ([SSNS]{.underline})
Environment Standard [defines nuclear weapon environment levels for
evaluating satellite system performance in nuclear
scenarios.]{.underline} Comprehensive Atmospheric Nuclear Environments
Standard (CANES) provides detailed nuclear environments and effects for
a number of different nuclear weapon-types as a function of height of
burst. A supplement to this MIL-STD covers nuclear-disturbed
communication environments and nuclear ground burst environments.\[70\]
[[DoD]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[adopted protective priorities using
commercial]{.mark}]{.underline} protective
[[equipment]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Department of Defense (DoD) has
experience in prioritizing and protecting systems since the 1960s. [The
DoD has prioritized and has protected selected systems against
EMP]{.underline} (and, by similitude to E3, GMD effects). DoD places
emphasis on protecting its strategic triad and associated command,
control, communications, computer, and intelligence (C4I) systems.
**[Nuclear EMP will burn]{.underline}** out **[every exposed electronic
system is FALSE]{.underline}**. [The DoD and Congressional
EMP]{.underline} Commission's EMP [test data demonstrates that smaller,
self-contained systems that are not connected to long-lines tend **not
to be affected by EMP fields**]{.underline}**.** [Examples]{.underline}
of such systems [include vehicles, hand-held radios, and disconnected
portable generators]{.underline}. If there is an effect on these
systems, it is more often temporary upset rather than component burnout.
\[71\] The NRC on Nuclear Power Facilities Vulnerabilities "[The [most
probable effect of EMP on a modern nuclear power plant is an unscheduled
shutdown]{.mark}]{.underline}. EMP may also cause an extended shutdown
by the unnecessary activation of some safety-related systems. In
general, [EMP would be a nuisance to nuclear plants, **but it is [not
considered a serious threat to plant safety]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Counter-measures to minimize the effects of EMP have been recommended.
Implementation of these recommendations would also increase the
protection of the plant against damage by lightning, switching, and
electromagnetic interference transients as well as general failures in
electrical, control, and instrument power. "\[72\] As part of a larger
EMP study in the 1980's [Sandia Laboratories analyzed the **"worst case"
scenario** and concluded that **EMP poses no substantial threat
to**]{.underline} such ([**nuclear) plants** based upon both analysis
and simulated EMP tests]{.underline}.\[73\] The NRC's current statement
The NRC requires U.S. nuclear power plants to be able to shut down
safely in the face of many extreme events -- tornados, hurricanes and
earthquakes. But the NRC also takes into account far more unusual
events, like solar flares and man-made electromagnetic pulse (EMP). Both
can affect generators, transformers and other parts of the electric grid
-- which in turn could affect nuclear power plants. [The NRC has been
examining]{.underline} these [issues for more than 30
years]{.underline}, starting in the late 1970s when the agency studied
how EMP could affect nuclear power plant safe-shutdown systems. In
February 1983 [the]{.underline} NRC issued the study's [conclusion:
nuclear power plants' safety systems can do their jobs after an EMP
event.]{.underline} The agency revisited the issue in 2007 to account
for the increasing use of digital computer systems in nuclear plants,
which potentially could be more susceptible to EMP. [The agency
continued to conclude as recently as two years ago that nuclear power
plants can safely shut down following an EMP event.]{.underline}
Additional research in 2010 analyzed and compared solar or
geomagnetically-induced current events to those of the EMP events
previously analyzed. This work led to the same conclusion as the EMP
studies -- U.S. nuclear power plants can safely shut down if a solar
storm disrupts the grid. The edge of the NRC's authority lies in a
nuclear power plant's electric switchyard, where our rules mesh with
those of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees the
nation's electric grids. Another body, the North American Electric
Reliability Corporation develops and enforces grid reliability
standards. The NRC works closely with FERC and NERC on grid reliability
issues, including the effects of solar or geomagnetic storms and EMP. In
2015 FERC began the process of creating reliability standards to protect
the grid against these events.\[74\] This new standard was made into law
on November, 17, 2016.\[75\]\[76\] The NRC continues to update operator
guidelines and requirements with changes in technology or new
understandings on issues previously not covered such as the events at
Fukushima in 2011. Safety enhancements on topics like spent fuel cooling
pools are covered in regular NRC updates, the latest being 2015 titled
Mitigation of Beyond-Design-Basis Events\[77\] . EMP Comparisons with
lightning Lightning shares many of characteristics of E2, but contrary
to what is often quoted, its magnitude can exceed even the peak E1
fields in the discharge region. Research on lightning indicates that a
stroke may contain significant components with rise-time of less than
10−7 sec and electric fields greater than 106V/m---more than a order of
magnitude greater than even the highest peak E1 fields, from the biggest
nuclear devices. The implications of lightning research for EMP
vulnerability is a critical topic to include in any future peer-reviewed
study of the EMP threat.\[78\]

[**[For combined sun blocking and industrial failure

[solution]{.underline}s is [growing mushrooms on dead trees and the

[[Monopolising land]{.mark} [for agro-industry]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
emission [offsets]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is **unsustainable**]{.mark}
over the longer run]{.underline}. [Industrial agriculture has
experienced a [declining]{.mark} biophysical [productivity, with **soil
depletion**]{.mark} and a [**drop in efficiency** of **nitrogen
use**]{.mark} [from 60% to 20%]{.mark}]{.underline} from the 1950s to
the 1990s (Ploeg 2010, 100), and [the expense of 'biophysical override'
**rising with the price of commodity inputs**]{.underline}, [including
energy]{.underline} (Weis 2007 ). These trends are expressed in falling
agro-industrial grain yields---from increases between 5 % and 10 % at
the height of the green revolution (1960s) to 1 % or less in the new
millennium (Cribb 2010 : 8). Further, **[[soil
erosion]{.underline}]{.mark}** [occurs at a rate [likely to destroy
**two-thirds** of]{.mark} the world's [productive land by
**2050**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [the **global nutrient cycle** is
declining with the exhaustion of]{.underline}]{.mark} [world
**[phosphate reserves]{.mark}**]{.underline}, there is [[rising
competition for freshwater]{.mark} for agriculture]{.underline}, [which
already uses 70 %, and [the **ocean fish catch** is predicted to
**collapse by 2040**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cribb 2010 : 10--11, 54, 76).
Meanwhile, [the industrial food system 'expends 10--15 energy calories
to produce 1 calorie of food]{.underline}, constituting a reversal of
the original purpose of agriculture' (Taylor 2014 : 92). Related to this
resource [intensiveness is [the]{.mark} substantial [responsibility of
modern agriculture for]{.mark} approximately **[30 % of]{.mark}
greenhouse gas [emissions]{.mark}**]{.underline} (McMichael et al. 2007
; Sage 2012 : 113). 16 In other words, the industrial food system is a
source of the problem for which it is considered the solution.

As above, [recycling the problem as solution is embedded in an ontology
that assumes small scale]{.underline}, [localised production systems are
inadequate to modern needs]{.underline}. But [modern needs are filtered
through the market lens]{.underline}, in turn, [jeopardising **social
sustainability**]{.underline}. As the IAASTD report noted, markets fail
to adequately value environmental and social harm (2008). That is,
application of a standardising metric deepens market rule, and
interprets social needs and 'ecosystem services' in interchangeable and
abstract terms---much like the abstraction of nature in value theory.
The IAASTD continues: 'the path of global agricultural development has
been narrowly focused on increased productivity rather than on a more
holistic integration of natural resource management with food and
nutritional security' (Ibid: 17--18)---underlining agriculture's
multifunctional contribution to complex social reproduction issues,
including restoring soil fertility and maintaining ecological
resilience. The IAASTD report coincided with and contributed to an
emerging scientific consensus that [the relative yields of
organic/agro-ecological versus non-organic farming are sufficient to
provision the current daily average consumption of calories across the
world]{.underline} (Pretty and Hine 2001 ; Pretty et al. 2003 ; Badgley
et al. 2007 ; CFS 2013 ). Further: 'research shows that [small farms are
**more productive than large farms** if total output is considered
rather than yield from a single crop]{.underline}....Yield advantages
can range from 20 to 60 per cent, because [polycultures reduce losses
due to weeds, insects and diseases]{.underline} [and make a more
efficient use of the available resources]{.underline} of water, light
and nutrients' (Altieri and Nicholls 2008 : 474).

#### But the transition solves -- small farms produce enough foods sustainably

**Altieri 09** (Miguel A. Altieri, professor of agroecology at the
University of California at Berkeley, "Agroecology, Small Farms, and
Food Sovereignty", Jul 01, 2009,

Small Farmers as Key Actors for Regional Food Security

In Latin America, there were about 16 million peasant production units
in the late 1980s, occupying close to 60.5 million hectares---34.5
percent of the total cultivated land. The peasant population includes 75
million people representing almost two-thirds of Latin America's total
rural population. The average farm size of these units is about 1.8
hectares, although the contribution of peasant agriculture to the
general food supply in the region is significant. These [[small units of
production were responsible for 41 percent of]{.mark} the agricultural
[output]{.mark} [for domestic consumption]{.mark} and for producing at
the regional level,]{.underline} [[51 percent of the maize]{.mark}, [77
percent of the beans]{.mark}, and 61 percent of the
potatoes]{.underline}.7 [[The contribution to **food security**]{.mark}
of this small-farm sector [is]{.mark} today as **[crucial]{.mark}** as
twenty-five years ago.]{.underline}

[[Africa has]{.mark} approximately [33 million small
farms]{.mark}]{.underline}, [representing [**80 percent of all farms**
in the region]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The majority of African
farmers]{.underline} (many of them are women) [are
smallholders]{.underline}, with two-thirds of all farms below 2 hectares
and 90 percent of farms below 10 hectares. [Most [small farmers practice
"low-resource" agriculture]{.mark} which is based primarily on the use
of local resources]{.underline}, [but which may make modest use of
external inputs]{.underline}. [Low-resource agriculture [produces the
majority of grains]{.mark}, almost all root, tuber, and plantain crops,
and the majority of legumes.]{.underline} Most [[basic food
crops]{.mark} are [grown by small farmers with]{.mark} **virtually
[no]{.mark}** or little **use of [fertilizers]{.mark}** and improved
seed]{.underline}.8 This situation, however, has changed in the last two
decades as food production per capita has declined in Africa. Once
self-sufficient in cereals, Africa now has to import millions of tons to
fill the gap. Despite this increase in imports, [smallholders still
produce most of Africa's food.]{.underline}

In Asia, [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} alone [[accounts for almost half
the world's small farms]{.underline}]{.mark} (on 193 million hectares),
[[followed by India with 23 percent, and Indonesia, Bangladesh, and
Vietnam]{.underline}]{.mark}. Of the majority of more than 200 million
rice farmers who live in Asia, few cultivate more than 2 hectares of
rice. [[China has]{.mark} probably [75 million rice farmers]{.mark} who
still practice methods similar to those used more than 1,000 years
ago]{.underline}. [**[Local cultivars]{.mark}**, grown mostly on upland
ecosystems and/or under rain-fed conditions, [make up the **bulk of the
rice produced by Asian**]{.mark} **small

[Cumulative [resistance to]{.mark}]{.underline} both

the response to this conjuncture, [[constituting]{.underline}
[a]{.underline}]{.mark} rising political, or first,
[[contradiction]{.mark} [for neoliberalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
financial and food shocks of 2007/8 propelled a Polanyian, 'systemic'
double movement towards greater state intervention in the market, or
deployment of 'extra-economic' mechanisms, involving direct land
appropriation overseas, and/or neo-productivism at home. Overall, [since
those shocks]{.underline}, [[there has been a trend towards]{.mark}

speculation]{.underline}, [[without]{.underline}]{.mark}, as yet,
[[sundering the regime of accumulation]{.mark} that underpins

[unrest]{.mark} [and]{.mark} through [constraints on the supply of

and subject to challenge]{.mark} from a variety of political sources,
both 'sub-hegemonic']{.underline} (reformist),
'[alter-hegemonic']{.underline} ('progressive'), [and

of the conjoined operation of the 'first' and 'second' contradictions of

### AT: Ozone\-\--2NC

#### Not extinction\-\--bounces back, in the meantime wear glasses and sunscreen!

Brian **Martin 82** \[Brian Martin (Professor of Social Sciences @ the
University of Wollongong) December 1982 "The global health effects of
nuclear war" Current Affairs Bulletin, Vol. 59, No. 7, pp. 14-26, online
@ http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/82cab/index.html\]

Another major threat to ozone comes from nuclear explosions. [Nitric
oxide is produced]{.underline} essentially [by the \'burning\' of
nitrogen in the atmosphere,]{.underline} and [this occurs]{.underline}
whenever air temperatures are sufficiently hot: in automobile engines,
in aircraft engines and [in nuclear explosions]{.underline}. Studies of
the creation of oxides of nitrogen by nuclear explosions were first
undertaken as part of the SST debate, to determine whether the nuclear
weapons tests in the 1950s and 1960s had reduced observed ozone
levels.\[28\] It was only in 1974 that John Hampson made a point which
had been overlooked, namely that large-scale nuclear war could cause a
major and disastrous reduction in ozone levels.\[29\] Calculations made
in the mid-1970s assuming large nuclear arsenals with many high-yield
explosions concluded that reductions of ozone could reach 50 per cent or
more in the northern hemisphere, with smaller reductions in the southern
hemisphere.\[30\] But [[since the number of high-yield weapons]{.mark}
in [present]{.mark} nuclear arsenals [is]{.mark} now [smaller, much less
oxides of nitrogen would be deposited]{.mark} in the stratosphere by
nuclear war [than assumed]{.mark} in earlier calculations, [and so
significant]{.mark} [ozone reductions are
unlikely]{.mark}.]{.underline}\[31\] This conclusion remains tentative.
The actual behaviour of stratospheric ozone is quite complicated,
involving many chemical compounds and numerous chemical reactions, the
changing effects of temperature, the angle and intensity of sunlight,
and the effect of air motions. Computer models of the effects of nuclear
war on ozone are able to take into account only a part of this
complexity, and new information about chemical reaction rates in
particular have led in the past to periodic revisions in the calculated
effects of added oxides of nitrogen. [If significant ozone reduction did
occur, the most important direct effect on humans would be an increase
in skin cancer]{.underline}. However, [this is seldom lethal, and could
be avoided by reducing exposure to sunlight.]{.underline} Potentially
more serious would be effects on crops.\[32\] Some of the important
grains, for example, are sensitive to uv. Whether the net effects on
crop yields would be significant is hard to estimate. But [whatever the
reduction in ozone, [ozone levels would return pretty much to normal
after a few years]{.mark}.]{.underline}\[9\] It seems unlikely that [in
the context of a major nuclear war the changes in uv alone would be of
serious concern]{.underline}. In particular, [[the threat of **human
extinction** raised by]{.underline}]{.mark} Jonathan
[[Schell]{.mark}]{.underline} in The Fate of the Earth,\[33\] based
mostly on effects of increased uv from ozone reduction, [[seems **very
small**]{.mark} indeed. It is sometimes claimed that nuclear war could
destroy ozone to such an extent that humans and animals would be blinded
by excess uv. Even if large numbers of high-yield weapons were exploded,
this possibility seems very unlikely except for a contribution to snow
blindness in the far north. [Stratospheric ozone can never be completely
removed]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} but at most reduced greatly.
[[Even if a **50 per cent**]{.mark} or more [reduction]{.mark} in ozone
[occurred]{.mark}]{.underline} - and as noted [this seems improbable
with present nuclear arsenals - [protection]{.mark} from uv for humans
[could be obtained from **sunglasses**]{.mark} or just ordinary glasses,
which absorb uv. [For animals]{.mark}]{.underline}, the following
considerations are relevant. [[Ozone levels vary considerably]{.mark}
from place to place and from time to time]{.underline}, both seasonally
and daily (sometimes by up to 50 per cent). Sunlight at the equator
typically passes through only half as much ozone as at the
mid-latitudes, yet animals at the equator are not known to go blind more
often than elsewhere. Furthermore, [[most ozone reductions]{.mark} from
a nuclear war [would be in the mid and high latitudes, where ozone
levels are higher to start with]{.mark} [and]{.mark} where the [\'path
length\' of sunlight]{.mark} through ozone [is increased]{.mark} due to
its oblique angle of incidence]{.underline}. But this does not mean
complacency is warranted, as the concerns of John Hampson illustrate.

#### The ozone layer doesn't matter

Sciences, The Times. September 15, 2014. "The ozone hole isn't fixed.
But that's no worry",
http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article4206440.ece

[How much damage did the ozone hole ever threaten to do
anyway?]{.underline} It is fascinating to go back and read what the
usual hyperventilating eco-exaggerators said about ozone thinning in the
1980s. [As a result of the extra ultraviolet light coming through the
Antarctic ozone hole, [southernmost parts of Patagonia and New Zealand
see about 12 per cent more UV light]{.mark} than expected]{.underline}.
This means that the weak September sunshine, **[[though it feels much
the same]{.underline}]{.mark}**, has the power to cause sunburn more
like that of latitudes a few hundred miles north. **[[Hardly
Armageddon]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The New York Times reported "an
increase in Twilight Zone-type reports of sheep and rabbits with
cataracts" in southern Chile. Not to be outdone, Al Gore wrote that
"hunters now report finding blind rabbits; fisherman catch blind
salmon". [[Zoologists]{.mark} briefly [blamed the near extinction of
many amphibian species on thin ozone]{.mark}. Melanoma in people was
also said to be on the rise as a result.]{.underline} [**[This was
nonsense]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [Frogs were dying out because of a
fungal disease spread from Africa --- nothing to do with ozone. Rabbits
and fish blinded by]{.underline} a little [extra sunlight proved to
be]{.underline} as [mythical]{.underline} as unicorns. An eye disease in
Chilean sheep was happening outside the ozone-depleted zone and was
caused by an infection called pinkeye --- nothing to do with UV light.
[And [melanoma incidence in people actually levelled out during the
period when the ozone got thinner]{.mark}.]{.underline} Then remember
that [the ozone hole appears when the sky is dark all day, and over an
uninhabited continent.]{.underline} **[[Even if it persists into the
Antarctic spring and spills north briefly, the hole allows 50 times less
ultraviolet light through than would hit your skin at the equator at sea
level]{.underline}]{.mark}** (let alone at a high altitude) in the
tropics. So [it would be bonkers to worry about UV as you sailed round
Cape Horn in spring, say, but not when you stopped at the Galapagos: the
skin cancer risk is 50 times higher in the latter place.]{.underline}

extra capacity. Grocery stores would run out of food, and deliveries of

#### Only depression-level collapse is necessary and sufficient to spark movements towards localized sustainability

Sciences, University of New South Wales, "Entering the era of limits and
scarcity: the radical implications for social theory," Journal of
Political Ecology Vol. 26, 2019\]

[Yet **[it is very unlikely that]{.mark} the kind of [transition]{.mark}
envisaged [could begin unless there is major breakdown in the
existing]{.mark} consumer-[capitalist system]{.mark}**. As [long as it
**keeps the supermarket shelves stocked**, discontent is **likely to be
muted**]{.mark}, [and focused on demands for more jobs and]{.mark}
higher [incomes **rather than system replacement**]{.mark}. [The
**Goldilocks outcome** would]{.mark}]{.underline} seem to [[be]{.mark}
an economic [depression that]{.mark} **falls short of catastrophic
breakdown**, but [is **serious enough to convince**]{.mark} **large
numbers** that [the system is **not going to provide**]{.mark} **for
them**]{.underline}.

The challenge to the Left

This analysis has especially important implications for those who are
radically critical of consumercapitalist society. Firstly it is evident
that the revolution required to solve the problem is far bigger than
that which Marx envisaged. Merely getting rid of capitalism will not
suffice. Secondly, the most promising frontier now for such critics is
the challenge to current society being set by unsustainable resource and
ecological impacts. Latouche said the limits to growth are giving
critical theory its last chance (2012: 75). Yet the foregoing argument
has been that this opportunity has hardly been recognized, let alone
taken up. Bookchin saw this some time ago. \"The New Left, like the old
left, has never grasped the revolutionary potential of the ecological
issues, nor has it used ecology as a basis for understanding the
problems of communist reconstruction and utopia\" (1973: 242).
[**Significant** and **[increasing numbers]{.mark}** of ordinary people
[are **seriously concerned** about]{.mark} these [issues and are
thinking]{.mark} **more** or **less in the general direction** [of
replacing]{.mark} consumer-[capitalism with]{.mark} [**localism** and
**simpler ways**]{.mark}]{.underline}. These themes are likely to be the
most effective foundations for critical social theory and practice now.

But unfortunately the Left has a deeply entrenched reluctance to embrace
these ideas. The traditional assumption has been that when power has
been taken from the capitalist class, the contradictions preventing full
application of the productive forces will be removed and technical
advance will lift all to material wealth. Socialism is distinctly not
conceived today in terms of frugality or localism. Indeed some
socialists embrace \'ecomodernist\' ideas, notably Phillips (2014) and
Sharzer (2012), who explicitly spurn the suggestion that local or
simpler ways are necessary or desirable.

David Harvey represents the many Marxists who reject localism both as a
goal and as a revolutionary strategy in favor of the typical socialist
focus on action at the state level (Harvey 2017). For a critique, see
Springer (2017). The Marxist position fails to address current
circumstances, where the goal must be to contradict individualistic
competitive affluence and must focus on citizen involvement in local
economies. Major change at the central or state level cannot be achieved
before [a **profound [cultural revolution]{.mark}**]{.underline} has
been achieved, and this [[is **most likely**]{.mark} **to occur**
[via]{.mark} developments [at the **local level**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Delusion and denial: the inability to respond

There are difficult and puzzling issues for social theorists that will
not be taken up in this article. They are the psychological and
institutional reasons for the failure to deal adequately with the limits
to growth predicament, or with its major sub-problems such as the
looming petroleum supply, debt, and climate change crises. The core
phenomenon to be explained here would seem to be failure to even
recognize the existence and/or seriousness of the problems, rather than
lack of appropriate remedial action.

[The **essential causal factor** is]{.underline} surely [that if the
limits to growth analysis is **accepted** then]{.underline} perhaps
[[the **most deeply entrenched**]{.underline}]{.mark} post-Enlightenment
[[**assumption** has to be **jettisoned**]{.underline}]{.mark}, i.e.,
[the **taken-for-granted conviction** [that
progress]{.mark}]{.underline} and the good life [are [**defined by
capacity to produce** and **consume more**]{.mark} and **more material
wealth**]{.underline}. The suggestion that the supreme social goal
should be materially simple lifestyles and systems, with no prospect of
rising to greater affluence over time, would seem to be about as
distasteful and unthinkable to workers and the lumpenproletariat as to
the super-affluent 1%.

6\. Conclusions: a reorientation of social theory

The argument is that the advent of the limits to growth issue should be
seen as requiring a major shift in the focal concerns of social
theorists, especially those interested in critical perspectives on
contemporary society and in sustainability and utopian themes. To begin
with, a limits perspective involves a commitment to an inescapable logic
that leads to quite specific conclusions regarding desirable social
forms and how they might be achieved. [If the limits are as severe as
has been argued, then [the goal **must be
transition**]{.mark}]{.underline} from consumer-capitalist society [to a
general form [that involves]{.mark} **far [lower resource use]{.mark}**,
and this has to mean **mostly [small-scale local economies]{.mark}**
that are **self-governing**, **basically [cooperative]{.mark}** [and
committed to]{.mark} **materially [frugal
lifestyles]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If this is so, then [the transition
is **essentially a cultural problem**, and it is **difficult to
imagine** how these ways could be established other than through a
**slow grass-roots process** whereby [ordinary people]{.mark}
**increasingly [coerced by scarcity]{.mark}** [and **economic
deterioration** take on]{.mark} the **[restructuring]{.mark} of their
own suburbs**, **towns** and **regions**]{.underline} (Alexander and
Gleeson 2019).

### AT: US Not Key\-\--2NC

#### US collapse goes global 

George **Friedman 17**, Geopolitical Forecaster and Strategist, "An
American Recession And The World"
https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/an-american-recession-and-the-world_us_5900b1f6e4b06feec8ac9251

Recessions are unpleasant and hurt some people disproportionately.
However, the [U.S. recession will likely hurt other countries more than
the United States. When combined with other global economic problems,
the recession will likely weaken Europe's anemic recovery and **strike
another blow at the Chinese**.]{.underline} It will also put further
downward pressure on commodity prices, [considering]{.underline} that
[the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [is the world's **largest
importer** and]{.mark} has been, to some extent, [the **engine
stabilizing the international system**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The 2007-09 recession hurt the Chinese tremendously because their
biggest export customers were the United States and Europe. In due
course, the Chinese slowdown cut China's consumption of industrial
commodities, including oil, hitting countries like Russia and Saudi
Arabia. This is part of the global exporters' crisis I have written
about previously. [The United States avoided the worst of this because,
while it is the second-largest exporter in the world, exports account
for only about 12.6 percent of its GDP]{.underline} (the U.S. ranks only
161st in the world in terms of exports as a percent of GDP, according to
the World Bank). [In part, this lack of dependence on exports helped
U.S. GDP grow on its internal engine.]{.underline} More important is
that the U.S. is less vulnerable to global downturns than other
countries.

[The [**decline** in]{.mark} the [**U.S. economy** will]{.mark}
inevitably involve a [drop]{.mark} in [U.S. **imports**. Under normal
circumstances, this]{.mark} slump [would **not**]{.mark} [**destabilize
the system**. But we have not been]{.mark} living under [normal]{.mark}
circumstances **[since 2008]{.mark}**]{.underline}. More precisely, we
are now living in a new normal. In the new normal, countries that were
driven by exports are now using diminished export demand to simply
maintain their economies in the hopes of generating enough domestic
demand to replace lost markets. In most cases, they have achieved a
fairly precarious balance at this point that is much more subject to
destabilization than in previous cycles. [[A]{.mark} relatively **[small
drop in]{.mark} global [demand]{.mark}** [can have a **substantial
impact**]{.mark}. Thus, a routine U.S. recession [will lead to]{.mark} a
small **[global decline, reversing]{.mark}** gains in
**[stabilization]{.mark}** made in recent years.]{.underline}

The [downturn in export demand will have a ripple effect because
exporting countries are also importing countries. [As **American
demand**]{.mark} [**contracts**, exporters' economies will]{.mark} be
affected and their need for imports will **[contract as well]{.mark}**.
This domino effect is normal. The problem is that [the **international
system's vulnerability has grown dramatically** because]{.mark} many
[countries have become **excessively reliant on exports**]{.mark}, and
this has been accompanied by a general weakness in their domestic
economies. Therefore, **[the ripple effect]{.mark}**, while not a tidal
wave, **[will be more substantial than]{.mark}** would have been the
case before **[2008]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[A]{.mark} striking [feature of today's]{.mark} global economic
[landscape is]{.mark} the many **[weaknesses]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the
world's [major economies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In Europe,
following]{.underline} the [Brexit]{.underline} vote, [[the]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[K]{.mark}**ingdom's economy [is]{.mark} likely to
be [beset by]{.mark} many years of **investor [uncertainty]{.mark}** as
it renegotiates its complex relationship with Europe]{.underline}.
[Meanwhile Italy,]{.underline} the Eurozone's third-largest economy, [is
having to cope with major difficulties in its banking system, the
over-indebtedness of its government, and growing public antipathy to the
Euro]{.underline}. This is all the more serious considering that Italy
will hold a constitutional referendum later this year, which could see a
fall in the Italian government. [It also must be of concern that, unlike
Greece, Italy is simply too big for Europe to save should it face an
economic and political meltdown.]{.underline} In [Asia, [Japan's]{.mark}
over-indebted economy is again [flirting with]{.mark} both
**[deflation]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **economic
[recession]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[while the Chinese economy is
struggling to]{.mark} make the [transition]{.mark} away from an
investment- and export-led economy to one led by consumption and the
service sector]{.underline}. At the same time, [major emerging market
economies like [Brazil, Russia and South Africa are]{.mark} all [having
to cope with]{.mark} **[depressed]{.mark} international [commodity
prices]{.mark}** and with excessive corporate U.S. dollar indebtedness.
Further clouding the global economic outlook is the fact that [the world
is]{.mark} now [drowning in debt]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, a recent
McKinsey Global Institute study found that [private and public sector
debt levels around the world today are very much higher than they were
in 2008 on the eve of the Great Economic Recession. [This makes
it]{.mark} all the more [important]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} world
[economy is not hit by]{.mark} a **[renewed shock]{.mark}** that might
cause the world economy to falter and that would make the repayment of
that debt]{.underline} all the [more difficult. It is against this
troubled background that one would think that [the last thing]{.mark}
that [the world]{.mark} economy [needs]{.mark} right now [is]{.mark} a
period of [investor uncertainty in the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates, the world's largest economy]{.underline}. Yet that
is very well what could happen if the presidential candidates continue
to outbid themselves on tax giveaways and lavish public spending
promises that might compromise the country's public finances.

**[[Because of its size and interconnectedness, developments in]{.mark}
the [US econ]{.mark}omy [are bound to have important effects
around]{.mark} the [world]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The [[US]{.mark} has
the [world's single largest economy]{.mark}, accounting for almost a
[quarter of global GDP]{.mark}]{.underline} (at market exchange rates),
[[one-fifth of global FDI]{.mark}, and [more than]{.mark} a [third of
stock market capitalisation]{.mark}. It is the [**most important**
export destination]{.mark} for one-fifth of countries around the
world.]{.underline} The [US [dollar]{.mark} is the [most widely used
currency]{.mark} in global trade and financial transactions, and changes
in [US]{.mark} monetary policy and investor sentiment [play]{.mark} a
[major role in driving global financing conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}
(World Bank 2016). At the same time, the global economy is important for
the US as well. Affiliates of US multinationals operating abroad, and
affiliates of foreign companies located in the US account for a large
share of US output, employment, cross-border trade and financial flows,
and stock market capitalisation. Recent studies have examined the
importance of global growth for the US economy (Shambaugh 2016), the
global impact of changes in US monetary policy (Rey 2013), or the global
effect of changing US trade policies (Furman et al. 2017, Crowley et al.
2017). It is likely that there will be shifts in US growth, monetary and
fiscal policies, as well as uncertainty in US financial markets. What
will be the global spillovers? Our recent work (Kose et al. 2017)
attempts to answer these questions: How synchronised are US and global
business cycles? How large are global spillovers from US growth and
policy shocks? How important is the global economy for the US? How
synchronised are US and global business cycles? Business cycles in the
US, other advanced economies (AEs), and emerging market and developing
economies (EMDEs) have been highly synchronous (Figure 1.A). This partly
reflects the strength of global trade and financial linkages of the US
economy with the rest of the world, but also that global shocks drive
common cyclical fluctuations. This was particularly the case at the time
of the 2008-09 Global Crisis. It is not a new phenomenon, however.
Although the four recessions the global economy experienced since 1960
(1975, 1982, 1991, and 2009) were driven by many problems in many
places, they all overlapped with severe recessions in the US (Kose and
Terrones 2015). Other countries tend to be in the same business cycle
phase as the US roughly 80% of the time (Figure 1.B). The degree of
synchronisation with US financial cycles is slightly lower, but still
significant -- credit, housing, and equity price cycles are in the same
phase about 60% of the time. Although it is difficult to establish
empirically whether the US economy leads business and financial cycle
turning points in other economies, recent research indicates that the US
appears to influence the timing and duration of recessions in many major
economies (Francis et al. 2015). Figure 1 Synchronisation of business
cycles Sources: Haver Analytics; World Bank; Kose and Terrones (2015);
IMF. Notes: Average share of years in which business cycles in the US
and all economies were in the same phase. A higher share suggests more
synchronization between two countries. [How large are global spillovers
from US growth and policy shocks? A [surge in US
growth]{.mark}]{.underline} -- whether due to expansionary fiscal
policies or other reasons -- [could [provide]{.mark} a [**significant
bo**ost to]{.mark} the [global economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Shocks
to]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} economy [transmit to the rest of the
world]{.mark} through three main channels]{.underline}**. [An
[acceleration in US activity can lift growth in trading partners]{.mark}
directly [through]{.mark} an [**increase in import demand**, and]{.mark}
**indirectly [by strengthening productivity spillovers embedded in
trade]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Financial [[market developments in]{.mark}
the [US]{.mark} may **[have even wider global
implications]{.mark}**]{.underline}. US bond and equity markets are the
largest and most liquid in the world and the US dollar is the currency
mostly widely used in trade and financial transactions. This makes US
monetary policy and investor confidence important drivers of global
financial conditions (Arteta et al. 2015, IMF2015). [Given its role in
global commodity markets]{.underline} (the US is both the world's
largest gas and oil consumer and producer), changes in [US
growth]{.underline} prospects [can [affect global commodity
prices]{.mark}. This affects activity, fiscal and balance of payment
developments in commodity exporters]{.underline}. Estimates indicate
that a percentage-point increase in US growth could boost growth in
advanced economies by 0.8 of a percentage point, and in emerging market
and developing economies by 0.6 of a percentage point after one year
(Figure 2.A). Investment could respond even more strongly. A boost to
investment could come for instance from fiscal stimulus measures -- but
the effect would largely depend on the circumstances of the
implementation of these measures, including the amount of remaining
economic slack, the response of monetary policy, and the adjustment of
household and business expectations to the prospect of higher deficit
and debt levels. A faster tightening of US monetary policy than
previously expected could, for instance, lead to sudden increases in
borrowing costs, currency pressures, financial market volatility, and
capital outflows for more vulnerable emerging market and developing
economies. Even in the absence of actual policy changes, heightened
uncertainty driven by financial market volatility or ambiguity about the
direction and scope of US policies could discourage investment both in
the US and in the rest of the world. Empirical estimates suggest that a
sustained 10% increase in US stock market volatility (specifically, the
VIX) could, after one year, reduce investment growth in the US by about
0.6 of a percentage point, in other advanced economies by around 0.5 of
a percentage point, and in emerging market and developing economies by
0.6 of a percentage point (Figure 2.B). Figure 2 US growth and

How important is the global economy for the US? Important as the US is
to the global economy, the US economy is also affected by its trade and
financial linkages with the rest of the world. Global economic
developments play an important role in driving activity and financial
markets in the US. US multinationals account for a large share of US
output and labour productivity growth, and their presence in financial
markets is large. In turn, foreign multinationals operating in the US
provide a large share of US employment and exports (Figure 3.A). Much of
the global value chain activity is conducted through US multinational
corporations and their affiliates abroad. Overall, one-quarter of US
exports represents US value added embedded in other countries\' exports.
This 'forward participation' is particularly high in chemicals, business
services, and electronics, and with China, Canada, and Mexico. 'Backward
participation' is more limited: the average import content of US exports
was 13% in 2014, well below the average for other advanced economies
(27%). This interconnectedness is an important source of spillovers
between the US and the global economy. As a result, growth setbacks
originating in other economies, or policy changes affecting market
access of US companies, can have detrimental effects on the US. These
effects are particularly noticeable in the more globally integrated
manufacturing sector (Figure 3.B). Figure 3. Importance of the global

point increase in global, advanced economy, and emerging market and
developing economy growth Sources: Bureau of Economic Analysis, World
Bank estimates. Notes: Cumulative impulse responses after one year of
GDP or industrial production (IP) growth in the US following a 1
percentage point increase in GDP or industrial production growth in 22
other AEs and 19 EMDEs (13 EMDEs for industrial production). 'Global'
indicates the weighted average impact of AEs and EMDEs. Vertical lines
indicate 16th-84th percentile confidence bands. Vector autoregression
models are estimated for 1998Q1-2016Q2 with four lags. Acceleration or
uncertainty? **[[Given its size and]{.mark} the [strength of its ties

growth could be expected to have positive effects for the rest of the
world, if not counterbalanced by increased trade barriers or an
unexpected tightening of global financing conditions. On the other hand,
persistent policy uncertainty [could hamper growth throughout the global
economy]{.underline}, and [could have particularly adverse effects on
investment growth in emerging market and developing
economies]{.underline}, which have already showed weakness in recent
years (World Bank 2017).
