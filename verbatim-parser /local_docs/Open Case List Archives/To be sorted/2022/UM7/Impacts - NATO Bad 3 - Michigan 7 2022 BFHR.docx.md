It is appropriate to judge post--Cold War [NATO a failure]{.underline}.
The [alliance is a **paper tiger**]{.underline}, [beset with slashed
**European defense budgets** and **hollow forces**]{.underline}.
[It]{.underline} has [become a social club]{.underline} and an
appetizer, a prelude to European Union membership for the
formerly-communist states of eastern and southern Europe. What [it is
not]{.underline} is [a **credible military alliance**]{.underline}. Nor
is it making America more secure.

NATO's performance in the foolish limited wars of the past two decades
has demonstrated Europe's failure to take either funding or fighting
seriously. In the Kosovo air campaign of 1999, the Royal Air Force
nearly ran out of bombs and spare parts. Moreover, it was U.S. aircraft
that had to conduct about two-thirds of all sorties during the
seventy-eight-day war.

By the 2011 Libya intervention, the situation had actually gotten worse.
Only eight of NATO's then-twenty-eight members chose to fight, using
their air forces. Additionally, most European countries ran out of smart
bombs and had to be resupplied in a hurry by the United States.

In Afghanistan, some American servicemen muttered that NATO's ISAF
(International Security Assistance Force) actually stood for "I Saw
Americans Fighting." The more charitable would grant that it was "I Saw
Anglos Fighting," including the British and Canadian troops who held
ground in the violent south and southwest. Despite the undoubted valor
of soldiers from all nations in the coalition, the reality was that most
European contingents were hamstrung by risk aversion, restrictive rules
of engagement, and national "caveats" that limited their ability to
fight. Some were even worse: the Italians were credibly alleged to have
bribed Taliban forces not to attack them.

NATO's relentless expansion has also long since passed the point of
farce. The alliance, fifteen members strong throughout most of the Cold
War, is about to add its thirtieth state, the newly-renamed North
Macedonia. [Macedonia boasts]{.underline} a [**tiny army** of eight
thousand men]{.underline} and a defense budget of \$120 million --- a
rounding error for the Pentagon. The previous mouse that roared, the
2017 addition of Montenegro, is even more militarily irrelevant.
[Montenegro's **entire army** has two thousand men]{.underline} --- less
than two U.S. battalions, or about 5 percent of the size of the New York
City Police Department. These nations have been welcomed into a mutual
defense alliance because that alliance is no longer serious about mutual
defense.

These new [NATO members provide **virtually no military
capability**]{.underline} to help others, [but]{.underline} they do
[bring]{.underline} one thing to the alliance: [**heightened tensions**
with Russia]{.underline}. There is ample evidence that the first Bush
and Clinton [administrations reassured Russian leaders]{.underline} that
[we would not expand NATO]{.underline} to their doorstep. [We have done
so]{.underline}, and now wonder why we are continually needing to
"reset" relations with Russia

We are told NATO's Baltic states face the existential threat of invasion
and reabsorption into Russia, but they sure don't act like it. Despite a
recent RAND Corporation war game that showed that Russian troops would
reach the Baltic capitals in a maximum of sixty hours, the [Baltic
countries spend **barely 2 percent** of GDP on defense]{.underline}. Yet
"E-stonia" can afford free internet throughout the nation.

[NATO's heavyweights]{.underline}, the United States excepted, are
nearly as impotent per capita as the alliance's Baltic and Balkan
members. These countries have the money but they have [chosen to
**shirk** their]{.underline} Article 3 [responsibilities and instead
rely on the]{.underline} American taxpayer and the [American
soldier]{.underline}.

[Britain]{.underline}, considered among the most capable NATO
militaries, has [slashed its defense spending to the
**bone**]{.underline} since the 2008 financial crisis. The United
Kingdom only clears the arbitrary 2 percent of GDP spending threshold
through some pensions legerdemain. Britain can now [fit its **entire
active duty army** into Wembley]{.underline} Stadium, with room to
spare. The Royal Navy is so short of personnel that it had a frigate and
a destroyer tied to the pier in Portsmouth as "training ships" for most
of 2017 and 2018.

Yet Germany manages to put Britain to shame in the free rider
sweepstakes. With the fifth largest economy in the world, Germany
dominates European politics. But its military, once a large and proud
frontline force, is a laughingstock. Germany's air force has regularly
had less than a third of its fighter aircraft ready for combat. Its
defense spending has drawn chiding and, now, outright attacks from
generations of U.S. presidents. In a story reminiscent of the
post--Versailles Reichswehr, due to equipment shortages [German
troops]{.underline} on a 2015 exercise [used **black broomsticks** to
simulate **machine guns**]{.underline}.

[Europe]{.underline} still [has **ample resources** to defend
itself]{.underline}, [even if]{.underline} one accepts the claim that
[Putin's Russia is **resolutely revanchist**]{.underline} and not
defensive or merely opportunistic in its conduct. [Even without the
United States]{.underline}, [NATO has **five hundred million people**
and]{.underline} a [combined GDP of **more than \$10
trillion**]{.underline}, [**more than triple** Russia's population and
wealth]{.underline}. It [also]{.underline} has [two **nuclear
deterrent** forces]{.underline}.

Only two possible [reasons]{.underline} exist [for European nations'
failure to field **credible military power**]{.underline}: they have
either decided they do not regard Russia as a serious security threat,
or [they are content to rely on **U.S. defense welfare**]{.underline}.

A [withdrawal of Germany from nuclear sharing with]{.underline} the
[Americans]{.underline} would [have **further advantages**]{.underline}.
[Coordinated with]{.underline} other countries of nuclear sharing, such
as [Belgium or the Netherlands]{.underline}, one could [send the
important]{.underline} political [**signal** to]{.underline} the Eastern
European [NATO countries]{.underline} that [**even** a **minimal nuclear
deterrent**]{.underline} under French leadership would [satisfy German
as well as **European security interests**]{.underline}. Moreover, it
would [enable Germany to present itself with **new credibility** in
matters of nuclear disarmament]{.underline}. At present,
[Germany]{.underline} is [in]{.underline} the [dilemma of only being
able to commit]{.underline} itself internationally to nuclear
disarmament [with **half its strength**]{.underline}, since nuclear
weapons are on its own territory. [However]{.underline}, the [withdrawal
from nuclear sharing]{.underline} could [give new impetus
to]{.underline} the debate on [the **N**on-**P**roliferation
**T**reaty]{.underline}."

and Defence Policy to the Middle East Peace Process. Witney previously
served as the first chief executive of the European Defence Agency in
Brussels. High Representative Javier Solana chose him in January 2004 to

for the agency. May 26, 2022; \"Five reasons driving European defence
integration after the Ukraine invasion\"; *ECFR*;
https://ecfr.eu/article/five-reasons-driving-european-defence-integration-after-the-ukraine-invasion/;
//CYang

On 18 May, the [European Commission]{.underline} released a new set of
proposals that [aim to put]{.underline} some [forward movement
into]{.underline} the [European defence]{.underline}
'[project]{.underline}'. Nothing new there, you might think: the past
quarter-century is littered with the wrecks of repeated previous efforts
to get member states to match their words with action. [So
far]{.underline}, the irresistible force of the arguments for greater
European defence integration --- "spend more, spend better, and spend
more together", in the time-honoured mantra --- [has made **little
headway**]{.underline} against the immovable object of national inertia
and vested interests. [Could **this time** be
**different**]{.underline}?

The proposals (a Joint Communication by the Commission and European
Defence Agency) respond to a tasking from EU leaders at their 11 March
emergency summit at Versailles, in the wake of the Russian invasion of
Ukraine. The instruction was to "put forward an analysis of the defence
investment gaps by mid-May and to propose any further initiative
necessary to strengthen the European industrial and technological base."

Analysing the capability gaps will have been relatively easy --- after
all, the agency has been pointing out what is missing for years. As the
head of the agency and European Union's high representative, Josep
Borrell, observed at the proposals' launch, "The European Defence Agency
has been working in the last years to explain these gaps, to explain how
we can and should fill these gaps. But to tell the truth, we have not
gotten a lot of success and nobody was listening to us." The [**emerging
lessons** of]{.underline} the [war in Ukraine]{.underline} have mostly
confirmed the earlier analysis, while [highlighting]{.underline} the
[**particular urgency** of restoring air superiority]{.underline} (air
defence has been neglected, and drones underutilised), [countering
Russian long-range artillery]{.underline}, [and developing new systems
for **c**ommand **and** **c**ontrol]{.underline},
[surveillance]{.underline}, [and data-sharing]{.underline} upon which
effective all-arms combat depends.

[But it is not just]{.underline} the shock of [Ukraine]{.underline} and
the attention of European leaders (alas, history shows that such
attention can be short-lived) [that give hope that]{.underline}, [this
time]{.underline}, [people]{.underline} may [listen]{.underline}.
[**Other reasons** for **optimism** include]{.underline}:

1.  Many of the old [reasons for]{.underline} sterile
    [dispute]{.underline} among member states [have **fallen
    away**]{.underline}. Europeanists and Atlanticists need [no longer
    argue about]{.underline} whether the [focus]{.underline} should be
    [on **expeditionary warfare** or **territorial
    defence**]{.underline}, or whether the point of it all is a stronger
    NATO or European "strategic autonomy". The [prospective
    accession]{.underline} to NATO [of Finland and Sweden]{.underline}
    will **[further minimise]{.underline}** the [differences between
    NATO and EU membership]{.underline}; and [everyone]{.underline} now
    [agrees]{.underline} that [European militaries need to make
    themselves]{.underline} more of [a **match for the
    Russians**]{.underline}. (It would be unhelpful, and perhaps
    premature, to suggest that, after Ukraine, the Russians may need a
    longish period to lick their wounds before they again become much of
    a threat to anyone.)

2.  Whether by good luck or judgment, the [Versailles]{.underline}
    tasking [focuses on]{.underline} the 'back office' of [European
    defence]{.underline}. Capabilities and industry are less susceptible
    to theological disputes than the 'front office' issues of operations
    and deployments, which give rise to all that angst about European
    dependency on the Americans. (The [unspoken but **widely
    understood**]{.underline} [truth is]{.underline} that eventually the
    [Americans will **refocus** on the Pacific]{.underline}, [expecting
    Europeans to take on **more and more** of the burden of their own
    defence]{.underline} --- but that the Americans can probably still
    be relied on to dictate the timing and methodology of this
    transition, which will help avert intra-European rows.)

3.  [Defence budgets are **growing**]{.underline}, [with more and more
    allies]{.underline} achieving or [targeting]{.underline} the NATO
    target of [2 per cent of **GDP spending** on defence]{.underline}.
    That [means **budgetary headroom**]{.underline} --- just how are the
    Germans going to spend their new €100 billion defence fund? -- which
    in turn means scope [for new projects]{.underline}, quite possibly
    [shared with **other Europeans**]{.underline}. (The reverse effect
    was evident in the years of defence budget cuts following 2008: far
    from defence ministries embracing more pooling of resources and
    efforts to get more bang for their depleted euros, defence spending
    was renationalised and collaboration fell off a cliff.)

4.  The [new proposals frame what is needed in a
    **sensible**]{.underline}, [**manageable** way]{.underline}, with
    three [phases envisaged]{.underline}. [First]{.underline} comes
    [restoration of **combat readiness**]{.underline} --- taking
    [training]{.underline} seriously, and "refilling the shelves". This
    relates to not just [replenishing ammunition]{.underline},
    [equipment]{.underline}, and [spares]{.underline} sent to the
    Ukrainians, but [also to]{.underline} the "[hollowing
    out]{.underline}" [that]{.underline} always [affects **unused
    militaries**]{.underline} --- the practice of concentrating
    resources on maintaining a full "shop window" of apparent assets
    even if that means running down inventories of ammunition and spares
    (it is little use having, say, a squadron of a dozen aircraft if a
    majority are unserviceable at any given moment). The
    [second]{.underline} phase is to [augment existing forces and
    capabilities by attending to]{.underline} the **[most
    pressing]{.underline}** of the [capability gaps]{.underline}
    identified, and beefing up numbers where necessary.
    [Third]{.underline} is the need to [address the future by putting in
    place]{.underline} a **[longer-term modernisation
    agenda]{.underline}**, [requiring]{.underline} the [integration of
    **new technologies**]{.underline}.

5.  Finally, the [Commission]{.underline} is [proposing to deploy
    **extraordinary financial firepower**]{.underline}. It is [offering
    to take charge of]{.underline} a [coordinated war-stock
    replenishment exercise]{.underline} in [the way it did with
    covid]{.underline}-19 vaccines --- with [€500m]{.underline} on
    [offer]{.underline} as subsidy [to incentivise member state
    participation]{.underline}. Beyond that, it proposes that member
    states interested in collaborating on a new equipment capability
    should form themselves into [European defence capability
    consortia]{.underline} --- which, [under a new Commission
    regulation]{.underline}, [would be **VAT-exempt**]{.underline}. And
    this tax exemption would apply not just to the initial procurement,
    but also to all through-life costs (operation, maintenance, and
    decommissioning). The Commission has further suggested that the
    [**E**uropean **I**nvestment **B**ank]{.underline} may feel moved to
    [increase its support for the European defence industry]{.underline}
    and joint procurement (€6bn is mentioned).

This [new cascade of]{.underline} '[incentives]{.underline}' [comes on
top]{.underline}, [of]{.underline} course, of the [more than €1bn per
annum]{.underline} already on [offer for **shared R&D**]{.underline}
projects [through the]{.underline} European Defence Fund
(**[EDF]{.underline}**) -- [which]{.underline}, the Commission makes
clear, it [also **aims to increase**]{.underline}. With so much 'free'
money on offer, even the most blinkered [national defence
ministry]{.underline} must [surely now join the queue]{.underline},
[however counter-cultural]{.underline} the [condition of having to
collaborate]{.underline} with others [may feel]{.underline}. (Hopefully
national finance ministries will fail to spot that such generous
recourse to the EU budget means that member states are actually being
bribed with their own money.)

So --- could [this truly be a **turning point** on]{.underline} the
[long and weary road to]{.underline} a [**more coherent** European
defence effort]{.underline}? The Commission clearly believes so, and
that it will be [in the driving seat]{.underline} --- they
"[envisage]{.underline}" a [future European joint programming and
procurement]{.underline} function (that is, the [centralised
coordination of European defence investment planning and
acquisition]{.underline}), to be [built on their **EDF** and **joint
procurement programmes**]{.underline}.

**[Eurodeterrent --- AT: Russia]{.underline}**

**Russia's not a threat.**

enlargement and US grand strategy: a net assessment"; International
Politics, Volume 57, Issue 3; Accessed Online via University of Michigan
Libraries; //CYang

Thinking through the enlargement issue requires putting the Russia
problem in perspective. Russia --- NATO's only real military adversary
--- is a pale imitation of the former Soviet Union. Thus, the [biggest
danger to NATO]{.underline} --- and the USA in particular --- may be
**[threat inflation]{.underline}**. Although Russia is geographically
large and relatively populous, its economy resembles that of a middling
European state. Moreover the [Russian economy is **highly
vulnerable**]{.underline} to swings in energy prices (oil and gas
account for more than two-thirds of Russia's export earning)
[and]{.underline} is [badly in need of reform]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} a host of powerful vested [domestic interests
**resist doggedly**]{.underline}. [Even über-hawk]{.underline} Senator
[Lindsey Graham]{.underline} (PolitiFact 2014) acknowledged that
[Russia's economy]{.underline} was [**dwarfed** by the West's economic
power]{.underline}, noting that [it]{.underline} only '[has an economy
the size of Italy]{.underline}' --- [a **second-tier** European country
with **serious economic problems**]{.underline}.

[Things have **not changed** in Russia's favor]{.underline} since 2014.
When Graham spoke, Russia's nominal GDP was \$2.06 trillion compared to
Italy's \$2.15 trillion. In 2017, Russia's nominal GDP was only \$1.58
trillion compared to Italy's \$1.94 trillion. Based on 2017 purchasing
power parity (PPP), Russia fares better than Italy, at \$3.78 trillion
compared to \$2.48 trillion. But [Russia's **GDP per
capita**]{.underline} was [only \$10,749]{.underline}, [compared to
Italy's \$32,110]{.underline} (World Bank 2019). Table 1 shows the
economic weakness of Russia when compared to the three largest economies
of Europe separately and combined, and compared to the USA separately
and combined with these three economies. [This tally **does not even
consider**]{.underline} the [combined economic wealth of **all 29 NATO
countries**]{.underline}.

![Table Description automatically

height="1.3895833333333334in"}

The [combined GDP of European NATO countries]{.underline}, calculated in
2010 prices, [was **\$18.8 trillion**]{.underline}, and if one considers
NATO as a whole, the figure jumps to \$38.1 trillion (NATO 2019b).
[Russia's]{.underline}, by contrast, [totals **\$1.6
trillion**]{.underline}. These figures show that [NATO has an **enormous
advantage** over Russia in economic strength]{.underline}.

[Nor is Russia]{.underline} a [**military peer competitor**
of]{.underline} the USA and its [NATO allies]{.underline}. According to
the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS), [Russia's
defense spending]{.underline} in 2017 was \$45.6 billion, [3.1% of its
GDP]{.underline}. This [amounts to **less than 10 percent**]{.underline}
of US defense spending, which IISS estimates totaled over \$600 billion
in 2017, 3.1% of GDP (IISS 2018). The Stockholm Institute for Peace
Research (SIPRI) calculates that Russia's 2018 military spending
amounted to \$64 billion (in 2017 prices and exchange rates), 4.2% of
GDP, compared to the US \$634 billion (in 2017 prices and exchange
rates), 3.1% of GDP (SIPRI 2020). These [numbers are just **blunt
comparisons** based on spending]{.underline} alone. The [differences
become **starker**]{.underline} and favor the USA even more [when we
consider its **technological edge** in weaponry and]{.underline}
superior [force employment]{.underline} (Biddle 2004).

Furthermore, [military expenditures for NATO]{.underline} countries as a
whole in 2018 (in constant 2017 US\$) [were \$933 billion compared to
Russia's \$64 billion]{.underline} (SIPRI 2020). Further, many years of
similar disparities add to the overall military advantage for the USA
and NATO. The gap is substantial even if one allows for the fact that
personnel costs --- pay and benefits --- are far greater in NATO
countries than in Russia. The 2018 disparity also [holds up **even if**
one excludes US]{.underline} and Canadian [spending]{.underline}.
[NATO's European members spent \$278 billion]{.underline} on defense
compared to Russia's \$64 billion. Indeed, [France]{.underline},
[Germany]{.underline}, [and the UK]{.underline} each [**individually
spend** close to what Russia does]{.underline}, with France closest at
nearly \$60 billion. Moreover, as Michael Kofman (2017) argues, 'The
[Russian armed forces are]{.underline} actually [small relative
to]{.underline} the [size of the country they]{.underline} have to
[defend]{.underline}, perhaps exceeding no more than 900,000 in total
size with a ground force [**doubtfully greater** than]{.underline} \~
**[300,000]{.underline}**. That may not seem small, but Russia comprises
one eighth of the earth's land mass.'

Furthermore, the wealthiest, most populous states of
[Europe]{.underline} are [spending **relatively little** on
defense]{.underline} as a percentage of GDP [and could]{.underline}
fairly **[easily]{.underline}** (in terms of economic capacity as
opposed to political will) [increase their expenditures]{.underline},
[widening]{.underline} the [resource gap that Russia faces]{.underline}.
The [balance of power]{.underline} --- using military expenditures as a
not unreasonable proxy for military capabilities --- **[clearly
favors]{.underline}** the USA, [NATO]{.underline}, [and
Europe]{.underline}.

Russia's difficulties in Georgia in 2008 (which to be sure have been
somewhat remedied based on learning from that conflict) and in the
conflicts in Ukraine and Syria offer recent examples of the challenges
that the Russian military would face against NATO in Europe. In
assessing the Russia-Georgia war, Kofman (2018) concludes:

> Russia won, but the Russian military simply was not set up to fight a
> modern war, even against a smaller neighbor, much less a peer
> competitor.... The war revealed profound deficiencies in the Russian
> armed forces. Moscow was surprised by the poor performance of its air
> power, and more importantly the inability of different services to
> work together. It truly was the last war of a legacy force, inherited
> from the Soviet Union. The conflict uncovered glaring gaps in
> capability, problems with command and control, and poor intelligence.

[Russia]{.underline} has fought differently in Ukraine and Syria.
'Moscow,' Kofman (2017), argued in an earlier piece, 'has applied force
sparingly, leveraging the local population, its own volunteers, and the
militias of allies' to meets its goals. But this is [a **far cry**
from]{.underline} the type of [conflict]{.underline} that [it would be
forced to fight to **existentially challenge** NATO in any of its
**major member states**]{.underline} whose defeat would represent a
serious threat to the US interests (e.g., France, Germany, or even
Poland). Kofman's assessment confirms this. He notes in reference to
Ukraine that '[Russia lacked the force]{.underline}, the
[money]{.underline}, [and the military experience to attempt any
**large-scale operation**]{.underline}.'

[Russia also faces **considerable social problems** that contribute
to]{.underline} its **[weakness]{.underline}**. A European Parliamentary
Research Service study summed it up well:

> [Economic recovery]{.underline} \[in Russia\] [has been
> **anemic**]{.underline}, with [growth likely to remain **below

//CYang

Russian President Vladimir [Putin's decision to invade
Ukraine]{.underline} has proved to be a [**strategic miscalculation** of
**historic proportions**]{.underline}. Having [failed to
produce]{.underline} a [**quick victory** for Moscow]{.underline}, the
unprovoked [invasion faces]{.underline} a [ferocious Ukrainian
insurgency that]{.underline} has already [caused]{.underline} some
[15,000 Russian combat fatalities]{.underline}, roughly the same number
that the Soviet Union lost in its entire nine-year campaign in
Afghanistan. The [Russian economy]{.underline} has been [battered by
**extraordinary international sanctions**]{.underline}. Calls for
[Putin]{.underline} to be [tried as a war criminal]{.underline} have
echoed around the world. It is safe to say that none of this was what
Putin expected when he launched his attack.

How did [Putin]{.underline} get things so wrong? In part, he [**clearly
overestimated** Russian military power and underestimated]{.underline}
the Ukrainian resistance. But just as important was [his misreading of
the West]{.underline}. His long personal experience --- observing the
weak international response to Russia's wars in Chechnya and Georgia,
its annexation of Crimea in 2014, and its support for Syrian dictator
Bashar al-Assad --- convinced him that the West would abandon Ukraine.
Given Europe's concerns about Washington's commitment to European
security in the wake of both the Trump presidency and the Biden
administration's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, he may also have
anticipated that the invasion would divide the United States and its
European allies, thus delivering a larger strategic victory than simply
the installation of a puppet government in Kyiv.

Had Putin been a better student of how Western democracies have
responded to vital threats to their security, he would have understood
why these assumptions were wrong. True, one lesson of the past century
is that Western democracies have frequently ignored emerging security
threats, as many of them did in the lead-up to the two world wars, the
Korean War, and the September 11 attacks. As the U.S. diplomat and
historian George Kennan once put it, [democracies]{.underline} are [like
a **prehistoric monster**]{.underline} so [indifferent to what is
happening around]{.underline} ~~him~~ \[[them]{.underline}\] that "[you
practically have to whack off]{.underline} ~~his~~

\[[them]{.underline}\] [aware that]{.underline} ~~his~~
\[[their]{.underline}\] [interests are being disturbed]{.underline}."
[But]{.underline} an equally important lesson of the past century is
that [when]{.underline} their [tails]{.underline} are [whacked hard
enough]{.underline}, [Western democracies react with
**speed**]{.underline}, **[determination]{.underline}**, and
**[strength]{.underline}**. For the United States and its European
allies, Russia's invasion of Ukraine --- which in size and scope
constitutes the largest use of military force on the European continent
since 1945 and poses a direct threat to NATO territory --- has provided
just such a case.

Yet even though the [Western response]{.underline} has [been
**surprisingly robust**]{.underline}, it is far too soon for the West to
declare victory. If democracies are capable of forming a swift and
united front against exceptional threats, they have also long been prone
to shifting priorities and turning attention inward once the immediate
crisis has passed. For [Western leaders]{.underline}, then, having
[quickly closed ranks to confront Putin's aggression]{.underline}, the
challenge now is how to sustain that unity. U.S. President Joe [Biden
stressed]{.underline} that point in Warsaw in March: "[We must remain
**unified today**]{.underline} and tomorrow and the day after and for
the years [and decades to come]{.underline}." This is no easy task. To
achieve that goal over the long term, the [United States
and]{.underline} its [allies must overcome]{.underline} the political
polarization, shifting economic burdens, and [changes of leadership
that]{.underline} have often [fragmented the West]{.underline} in the
past. [Otherwise]{.underline}, the [**unity** over Ukraine
could]{.underline} turn out to [be **short-lived**]{.underline}, leaving
the West once again divided and autocrats strengthened.

PUTIN'S MISTAKE

It is not surprising that Putin would have assumed that the West would
respond to a Russian invasion of Ukraine with harsh rhetoric but not
much more. In 2008, when Putin sent Russian forces to dismember Georgia,
French President Nicolas Sarkozy rushed to negotiate a cease-fire that
kept Russian gains in place, while the United States and other European
countries declined to back up their official dismay with even symbolic
sanctions. The reaction six years later to Putin's annexation of Crimea
and his instigation of a separatist war in eastern Ukraine was only
slightly tougher: although Russia was evicted from the G-8 and subjected
to limited sanctions, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.S. President
Barack Obama both ruled out sending lethal military aid to help Ukraine
defend itself.

In similar fashion, Washington and its European partners refused to
impose meaningful penalties on Russia after it intervened in the Syrian
civil war in 2015, indiscriminately bombing civilians, targeting
hospitals, and eventually leveling the city of Aleppo. In recent years,
attempted assassinations of Putin's opponents at home and abroad with
nerve agents prompted only the imposition of small-scale sanctions and
the expulsion of some Russian diplomats from Western countries. And when
Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Western
democracies and media outlets criticized the Kremlin but did little
else.

The behavior of European leaders in the months leading up to the attack
on Ukraine suggested that the West was likely to stick to this pattern.
Dismissing the evidence presented by the U.S. and the British
governments of an imminent invasion, many European leaders assumed that
Putin was amassing troops near Ukraine for leverage to negotiate new
security arrangements. Several of them traveled to Moscow looking to cut
a deal. The German government in particular recoiled at the prospect of
responding forcefully to Putin's mounting aggression, blocking attempts
to activate the NATO Response Force and denying NATO allies permission
to send Ukraine lethal equipment of German origin. At a White House
press conference in early February, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz
pointedly refused to pledge to terminate the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline
should Russia invade Ukraine. The apparent divisions of the West were so
obvious that Biden openly worried that a "minor incursion" might lead to
a Western "fight about what to do and not do."

These developments reinforced Putin's conviction that the West was a
spent force. "There is also the so-called liberal idea," the Russian
leader told the Financial Times in 2019, "which has outlived its
purpose." Chinese President Xi Jinping, Putin's collaborator in a
strategic partnership "with no limits," undoubtedly encouraged that
thinking. The Chinese president's mantra had long been: "The East is
rising, the West is declining." But such calculations failed to account
for what would happen when Russia undertook a blatant, unprovoked
invasion of a sovereign European democracy --- an act that went well
beyond any of Putin's earlier aggressions.

CLOSING RANKS

[Rather than splitting the West]{.underline}, Putin's assault against
[Ukraine **united** it]{.underline}. Within days of the invasion, the
[United States]{.underline} and its allies joined forces to [impose a
**sweeping sanctions regime**]{.underline} on Russia, making it the most
sanctioned country in the world. [Russian banks]{.underline} were
[barred from using]{.underline} the [SWIFT]{.underline} money exchange
mechanism, [Russian central bank reserves]{.underline} in foreign
countries were [frozen]{.underline}, and [exports of critical
technologies]{.underline} were [banned]{.underline}, affecting 50
percent of Russia's technology imports and 20 percent of all imports.
[Putin]{.underline}, [senior officials]{.underline} in his
administration, [and]{.underline} a [host of Russian
oligarchs]{.underline} were [sanctioned]{.underline} and their assets
seized. [Russian aircraft]{.underline} were [banned from
entering]{.underline} the [airspace]{.underline} of 33 countries.
[Germany shelved Nord Stream 2]{.underline}, the [United
States]{.underline} and other countries [cut off]{.underline} imports of
[Russian oil]{.underline}, and the EU moved to reduce its reliance on
Russian energy. Nearly 500 Western companies have left the Russian
market. The West's intent, as French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire put
it, was to "[cause the **collapse** of the Russian
economy]{.underline}."

[Western countries]{.underline} also [mobilized]{.underline} against
Russia [politically]{.underline}. The [UN Security Council]{.underline}
voted 11--1, with three abstentions, to [condemn the
invasion]{.underline}, although Russia's lone veto blocked its
enforcement. The [UN General Assembly followed suit]{.underline}, voting
141--5 to [demand]{.underline} that [Russia withdraw from
Ukraine]{.underline}. The [International Court of Justice ordered
Russia]{.underline} to [halt all military operations]{.underline} in
Ukraine. [International cultural]{.underline} and sporting
[organizations]{.underline}, such as FIFA, world soccer's global
governing body, [also joined in]{.underline} by banning Russian
participation in their activities.

The [West's **military response**]{.underline} was [equally
impressive]{.underline}. Rather than withdraw forces from eastern Europe
as Putin had demanded, NATO [doubled]{.underline} its [**combat
presence** in the region]{.underline}, activated its Response Force, and
placed [40,000 troops]{.underline} under its command. More than 35
countries began or increased [weapons shipments to Ukraine]{.underline}.
This aid ranged from the basic---[rifles]{.underline},
[ammunition]{.underline}, [helmets]{.underline}, [Kevlar
vests]{.underline}, [artillery shells]{.underline}, and [grenade
launchers]{.underline}---to the [sophisticated]{.underline} --- [Stinger
antiaircraft missiles]{.underline}, [U.S. Javelin antitank
missiles]{.underline}, Swedish AT-4 rocket launchers, British
next-generation antitank weapons, and armed drones. The [**U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} has [contributed **over \$1.7 billion** in
aid]{.underline} to the Ukrainian military [since the start of the
war]{.underline}, and the EU committed 500 million euros to the
Ukrainian defense, marking a first for the bloc, which had previously
never provided military assistance to another country.

Support for these measures has also been broad and deep, including in
countries that have historically been among the most reluctant to be
drawn into international conflicts. Both Switzerland, the
quintessentially neutral nation, and Singapore, a proud practitioner of
great-power balancing, imposed economic sanctions on Russia. Japan,
which has infamously strict immigration policies, opened its doors to
Ukrainian evacuees. Most significantly, Scholz announced a Zeitenwende
--- a historic pivot --- in which Germany committed to provide Ukraine
with lethal aid, pledged to exceed NATO's defense spending target of two
percent of GDP, created a 100 billion euro defense fund to buy equipment
for its depleted armed forces, and promised to rapidly end its reliance
on Russian energy. "It is clear that we must invest much more in the
security of our country, in order to protect our freedom and our
democracy," Scholz told the Bundestag on February 27. It was a sentiment
widely shared in other Western capitals.

JOLTED AWAKE

[Putin's failure to anticipate]{.underline} this [unified response
reflects]{.underline} a [**misunderstanding** of how democracies
operate]{.underline}. His flawed analysis is partially rooted in the
reality that given that they are responsible to their people,
democracies tend to be more concerned about problems at home than about
threats gathering abroad. Since the end of the Cold War, moreover, many
European governments also seemed instinctively to doubt that other
countries might resort to war to achieve their geopolitical aims and
assumed that the economic integration and globalization of recent
decades had rendered war on the European continent obsolete. Why fight
when commerce and exchange are so profitable?

But as Kennan noted, although democracies are slow to anger, they react
with fury when their interests are directly threatened. German Kaiser
Wilhelm II never anticipated that his support for Austria's ultimatum to
Serbia would trigger war with France and the United Kingdom, a dynamic
that repeated itself 25 years later when Adolf Hitler invaded Poland.
Washington sought to sit out both world wars and joined them only after
Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare and Japan attacked Pearl
Harbor. The U.S. policy of containment, which sought to prevent the
spread of communism during the Cold War, took root only after North
Korea invaded South Korea. Western leaders eagerly embraced the peace
dividend that came with the collapse of the Soviet Union, and they were
only partially awakened from their slumber after 9/11.

The tendency of democracies to switch from passivity to action is just
that --- a tendency, not a rule. Whether or not they do so is often
determined by the choices that Western leaders make. Here Biden's adroit
diplomacy in the face of an exploding crisis was critical. He and his
team used the threat posed by Putin's aggression to make good on his
long-standing vow to strengthen transatlantic relations and the broader
democratic community. When U.S. intelligence concluded in late 2021 that
Russian forces were preparing to invade Ukraine, Biden made two critical
decisions. The first was that the United States would not defend Ukraine
itself. The second was that he would work with NATO members and other
partners to pursue a three-pronged strategy to impose massive economic
penalties on Russia, bolster NATO's posture in eastern Europe, and send
more weapons to Ukraine to help it defend itself.

Beginning in mid-November 2021, [Biden]{.underline} worked to [build a
**collective Western response**]{.underline} to Russia's likely
invasion. [Top U.S. **intelligence officials**]{.underline} briefed
allies on Putin's plans, [sharing sensitive information]{.underline}
that even senior U.S. officials normally wouldn't see. U.S. diplomats
engaged with their counterparts to map out possible sanctions packages.
[U.S. military leaders]{.underline} met with NATO and other allies to
discuss how to [improve **readiness** and devise]{.underline} possible
[**security assistance** for Ukraine]{.underline}. This painstaking
diplomacy reflected the conviction that making demands of allies would
be counterproductive. Instead, [Washington]{.underline} needed to give
allies time and space to make their own decisions. Biden wasn't seeking
credit for his exceptional leadership; he was seeking to [forge a
**united Western response** that]{.underline} could [meet the
moment]{.underline}.

That initial objective was achieved because of the audacity of what
Putin attempted. Had he simply seized another slice of Ukraine, as he
did when he took Crimea, he might have left Biden facing a NATO alliance
that remained split on whether or not a redline had been crossed. But by
opting for a full-fledged invasion, Putin removed any doubt regarding
the extremity of his actions.

STRONGER TOGETHER

[For Biden's approach to succeed]{.underline}, however, the [West's
**unified front** against Russia's invasion must not]{.underline} be
allowed to [**weaken** or **erode** as]{.underline} the [war
progresses]{.underline}. Many obstacles stand in the way: Putin will
doubtless attempt to exploit divisions within the alliance; disputes
could arise over what steps to take next or what concessions to offer;
and the burden of punishing Russia will inevitably fall unequally across
countries, fueling resentment and disagreement. These problems will be
multiplied if, as Kennan warned, democracies react with so much fury
they not only damage the adversary but also themselves --- as could be
the case if the objective morphed from restoring Ukraine's sovereignty
and independence to a policy of active regime change in Russia. It is
possible to do too much as well as too little.

Great wailing and despair from the NATO preservation crowd on both sides
of the Atlantic will inevitably accompany any meaningful policy shift.
But 75 years is an exceedingly long period for any policy to be relevant
and beneficial (much less optimal), and America's NATO membership is no
exception. Indeed, it seems to epitomize the problem of policy entropy.
A U.S.-led NATO is now well beyond its appropriate expiration date. It
is time to accord the alliance the retirement celebration that should
have been held when the Cold War came to an end and the Soviet Union
dissolved. [Moving to a new]{.underline}, more [restrained posture does
not mean]{.underline} that [the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline} will
[take **no interest** in Europe's affairs]{.underline}. [We need to
reject]{.underline} the [simplistic]{.underline} "[**light switch**
model]{.underline}" [of]{.underline} America's engagement in the world,
with only two possible settings: "[off or on]{.underline}."13 There are
many settings between those two extremes, and there are multiple forms
of engagement--- diplomatic, economic, and cultural, as well as
security.

Every effort should be made to preserve a robust, mutually beneficial
transatlantic economic relationship. The United States also can and
should maintain extensive diplomatic and cultural connections with
Europe. And Washington should establish a consultative body either with
a new European security organization or with the Continent's main
military powers to address issues of mutual concern. Beyond that aspect,
[there is **nothing** to prevent]{.underline} joint military exercises
and even temporary [deployments of U.S. air and naval
units]{.underline}, [if the security environment turns]{.underline} more
[threatening]{.underline}. The [point is]{.underline} just that [America
should not seek to be Europe's **permanent security
blanket**]{.underline} and hegemon.

This more flexible approach would constitute an updated version of
Robert A. Taft's policy of the free hand. Moreover, it would be one
component of a U.S. global grand strategy based on realism and
restraint.14 [America would **no longer shackle** itself to commitments
that have more drawbacks than benefits or]{.underline} those that [lock
the republic into obligations that no longer make sense]{.underline}. It
would [end]{.underline} the thankless, [**unproductive strategy** of
trying to **micromanage**]{.underline} the [security affairs
of]{.underline} both [Europe]{.underline} and the neighboring Middle
East. For U.S. leaders to seek to deny their own country the essential
element of policy choice is perverse. Indeed, a [sustainable
transatlantic policy]{.underline} for the 21st century [must rest firmly
on]{.underline} the [**principle of maximum choice** for the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline}.

**US credibility is [structurally low]{.underline}.**

The [credibility of]{.underline} the [U.S. commitment to]{.underline}
its [NATO allies]{.underline} has [long been **unclear**]{.underline}.
At root, [credibility hinges on]{.underline} the [perception
in]{.underline} the [minds of foreign decisionmakers]{.underline} that a
[state has sufficient interest]{.underline} in a given issue that [it is
willing to pay]{.underline} a certain --- potentially
[large]{.underline} --- [cost to **obtain** or **secure** that
objective]{.underline}. Owing to the exorbitant prospective costs of a
U.S.--Soviet nuclear exchange during the Cold War, regular transatlantic
crises revolved around the question of whether the United States would
trade "Boston for Bonn" in the event of a general European war.8 So long
as the United States retained sole control of NATO's decision to
escalate past the nuclear threshold, U.S. policymakers faced a real
problem in making Soviet policymakers and American allies alike believe
that they would willingly take the nuclear plunge if events dictated.9
As Thomas Schelling noted long ago, [it is **inherently difficult** to
convince other actors]{.underline} that [the **U**nited **S**tates will
**commit suicide** for other states]{.underline}.10

Still, this [problem was at least **plausibly manageable** during the
Cold War]{.underline}.11 Despite the prospective costs, the United
States retained a large and pervasive interest in keeping Western
Europe's economic and military potential beyond Soviet control. These
objectives, in fact, heavily shaped the United States' Cold War
commitment to European security as the United States moved (1) to defend
Western Europe from potential Soviet machinations, and (2) to deter
Soviet adventurism against the area in the first place.12 The
alternative was clear: if the Soviet Union were to dominate Europe's
war-making strength, it might tip the balance of power against the
United States, requiring a potentially ruinous counter-mobilization and
global competition that an isolated United States might be unable to
win. Geography reinforced this imperative, as failure to deter or defend
against a Soviet assault across the inner-German border meant the USSR
could quickly overrun the region. The result was a concerted effort by
the United States to make its promise to defend its NATO allies as
credible as possible by forward-deploying large military force and
seeking ways to escalate a contest with the USSR should it prove
necessary.13

[Today]{.underline}, the [situation is **reversed**]{.underline}. The
grand bargain in which Washington kept its finger alone on the nuclear
button remains intact; if the United States is to fully honor its treaty
commitments, it must ultimately be willing to engage in a nuclear
exchange with Russia for the sake of its allies. However, where the
United States could plausibly claim to trade Boston for Bonn prior to
1991, [**no amount of reassurance** can make]{.underline} the [promise
to trade Toledo for Tallinn credible today]{.underline} --- the
[stakes]{.underline} of the game [are **too low**]{.underline}.

Alliances function when states decide that their mutual preservation
adds to each side's national security and can be attained at a cost
proportional to the benefit. For better or worse, NATO's post-Cold War
enlargement altered this equation by notionally committing the United
States to defend a host of states in Eastern Europe of questionable
relevance to U.S. security. Indeed, those states most immediately
threatened by Russia --- [Estonia]{.underline}, [Latvia]{.underline},
and [Lithuania]{.underline}, followed by Poland --- [are]{.underline}
among [the **least important** allies in **crude geopolitical
terms**]{.underline}. The three Baltic states combined accounted for
only 0.13 percent of total NATO defense expenditures and 0.26 percent of
NATO members' GDP as of 2016; Poland represented 1.17 and 1.54 percent,
respectively.14 American exchange with these states is similarly
limited: trade with the Baltic states as a whole came to less than \$3
billion in 2015 against over \$3.75 trillion in total U.S. trade.15
Baldly stated, these [states could disappear without
compromising]{.underline} the [United States' **economic security** or
NATO's **military viability**]{.underline}. The questionable value of
these states alone thus [renders]{.underline} the [U.S. commitment to
their defense **highly contestable**]{.underline}.16 The American
public, meanwhile, seems to recognize this very dynamic at some basic
level, with 37 percent of U.S. citizens in a 2015 Pew Global Attitudes
survey expressing reluctance with aiding a NATO ally threatened by
Russia.17

Political [geography **further compounds** NATO's problems]{.underline}.
Not only can [countries threatened]{.underline} by Russia be [lost
without compromising NATO's ability to defend]{.underline} the rest of
[Europe]{.underline}, but [even an expanded Russia would be **poorly
placed** to dominate the continent]{.underline}. Belarus and Ukraine,
after all, lie across any Russian advance into Central Europe, while
simply retaining control of a unified Germany affords NATO a
defense-in-depth it never enjoyed during the Cold War. Add in the
reality that Russia is an economic, political, and military pygmy
compared to the Soviet Union everywhere except in the nuclear realm, and
the [**U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}' [**intrinsic interest**
in]{.underline} those [states]{.underline} most immediately threatened
by Russia is [**substantially less** than during the Cold
War]{.underline}.18 Simply put, unlike the situation vis-à-vis the
Soviet Union, Russian dominance over the Baltic states, Poland, and
other new(er) NATO members would not result in the United States'
eviction from Europe and concomitant loss of the region's economic or
military strength.

[Military pressures **reinforce**]{.underline} these
[dilemmas]{.underline}. Whereas a conventional defense of Western Europe
was at least a possibility prior to 1989--1991, distance, reinforcement
rates, and force-to-space ratios mean a conventional [defense
in]{.underline} Eastern [Europe is not]{.underline} a [**realistic
option** today]{.underline}.19 [War games]{.underline} by the Rand
Corporation [highlight]{.underline} the [problem]{.underline} in the
Baltics context. To be sure, forces stationed in Eastern Europe can
serve as a tripwire to deter Russian aggression by seemingly promising
to bring NATO members' collective strength to bear.20 If deterrence
fails, however, and short of committing nearly all of NATO's
conventional ground and air power to the theater, [even
**heavily-armored NATO forces**]{.underline} can [only slow
down]{.underline} a [Russian assault and promise]{.underline} a [lengthy
East--West conflict]{.underline}. Yet here, [NATO]{.underline} again
[faces **real limits** to fighting]{.underline} in and around NATO's
East European members.21 Though the [United States]{.underline} can
threaten conventional escalation, it [cannot **credibly commit** to
fighting for states of **low strategic value**]{.underline} if doing so
risks a strategic nuclear exchange.

Nevertheless, the United States would undoubtedly face calls for
precisely such steps that might lead to nuclear escalation in any losing
conventional fight. Moreover, since any sustained effort to defend or
retake the Baltics requires NATO conventional operations close to the
Russian homeland, it risks attacks (accidental or otherwise) on Russian
territory that invite an escalatory response. Russian antiaccess and
area-denial (A2/AD) assets used against reinforcements flowing into the
region --- to say nothing of direct attacks on Poland --- may also
result in strikes on Russian-owned Kaliningrad, generating a similar
escalation problem. In short, [NATO]{.underline} cannot readily defend
its Eastern flank through conventional means, faces implausibly large
strategic risks if it tries, and so [confronts an **insoluble
credibility crisis**]{.underline}.22 Indeed, that [Estonia]{.underline}
is now [preparing to wage]{.underline} a lengthy [guerilla
war]{.underline} against a prospective Russian occupying force, while
[Lithuania]{.underline} is slowly [moving to reinstate]{.underline} a
[military draft suggests]{.underline} vulnerable [states
recognize]{.underline} the [**U**nited **S**tates' **credibility
dilemma**]{.underline} and are hedging their security bets as best they
can.23

If anything, the main function of NATO deployments has been to
antagonize a Russia that has far more at stake in Eastern Europe for
geographic and historical reasons than the United States.24 To be clear,
NATO expansion in and of itself did not cause East--West relations to
deteriorate.25 However, U.S.-backed efforts to expand NATO eastward and
subsequently deploy military forces to the region have been met with
Russian pushback --- Russian overflights of NATO airspace, diplomatic
obfuscation, and military deployments have all accelerated in recent
years.26 Assuming NATO efforts in Eastern Europe continue, Russian
leaders are prone to respond with further bellicosity that generates
further strains in NATO--Russian relations.27 Paradoxically, the
resulting insecurity spiral increases the likelihood that efforts to
deter Russia will result in deterrence failure.28 Combined with the
possibility that a NATO--Russia crisis may see Russia escalate the
confrontation in order to de-escalate the situation, the risk of
miscalculation is clear.29 Collectively, this situation simultaneously
invites Russian actions designed to discredit the United States in the
eyes of its allies, gives threatened allies incentives to force events
with Russia to tie American hands and deepen the United States'
involvement, and increases the risk of an action-reaction cycle.30

The [net result is a **dangerous standoff**]{.underline}. To deter
aggression, NATO relies on a collective security promise ultimately
capped by the pledge that the [United States]{.underline} will risk its
own survival by putting its nuclear forces to use on behalf of its
allies. For the Baltic states, Poland, and--- potentially in the future
--- NATO's other post Cold War additions, this [pledge is **no longer
realistic** on strategic or military grounds]{.underline}. The
[steps]{.underline} the [United States]{.underline} and its allies are
[taking to reassure]{.underline} the most vulnerable members of
[NATO]{.underline}, however, [increase the odds of a **NATO-Russia
crisis**]{.underline}. Yet if and when a crisis erupts, the clarifying
effect of a prospective nuclear exchange is apt to cause cooler heads to
prevail and encourage U.S. efforts to restrain the dogs of war ---
[revealing that American security guarantees to]{.underline} Eastern
[Europe **were not credible** in the first place]{.underline}. [The more
the United States continues **pretending**]{.underline} that [its
commitment]{.underline} to all NATO members [is created
equal]{.underline}, the more it [risks creating a situation
that]{.underline} will [reveal the **shibboleth** of the U.S.
commitment]{.underline}.

[Deterrence theory is almost as old as the nuclear age]{.underline}.
Consequently, the idea of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) and the use
of nuclear weapons as a retaliatory deterrent has dominated the field of
nuclear weapons and politics from the 1950s onwards.\[1\] However, like
any field, a series of **[biases infect]{.underline}** it. This blind
trust and belief in the postulations of **[Deterrence
Theory]{.underline}** has established what Nick Ritchie called [the
"regime of nuclear truth" and denominated "nuclear
absolutism.]{.underline}"\[2\] The effects of [this unquestionable
belief in Deterrence Theory sharply increases States' reliance on and
valuing of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. Consequentially, it [poses an
**existential threat** to disarmament processes and severely undermines
nuclear weapon States' Article VI obligations under the]{.underline}
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ([NPT]{.underline}).
It is long past time these 'truths' were punctured.

Deterrence Theory, derived from a Realist school of thought, postulates
that [the possession of nuclear weapons]{.underline} -- the ultimate
deterrent -- [will thwart and deter attacks against the
possessor]{.underline}. The sheer destructive power inherent in a single
nuclear weapon, let alone thousands detonating in quick succession, make
their use (almost) unthinkable. As a means to solidifying a unified
front against the Soviet Union in the aftermath of the Second World War,
the Western European States along with the United States formed the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([NATO]{.underline}) in 1949 to
[deter the Soviet Union's massive conventional forces, as well as its
ever-increasing nuclear arsenal after its first test a few
months]{.underline} [later]{.underline}. [With NATO, the United States
became the guarantor of]{.underline} the defence of Western Europe, and
[the so-called US **nuclear umbrella was born**.]{.underline}

[As stated in **Article V**]{.underline} of the NATO treaty, [an attack
on one member was an attack on all of them. The US nuclear umbrella
is,]{.underline} therefore, [a security assurance agreement that the US
deterrent intended primarily to defend itself, also extends over the
**territory of its NATO partners**]{.underline}.\[3\] In other words,
the [United States would defend NATO]{.underline} members against
aggressors, even [resorting to nuclear weapons,]{.underline} should the
situation require these capabilities to be deployed**[. In
theory]{.underline}**, [the US nuclear umbrella would soothe NATO
members' anxieties]{.underline} and serve as an alternative to the
acquisition of their own nuclear weapons.\[4\] [However]{.underline},
given its Realist roots, the crucial question arises: [**when push comes
to shove**, would the United States be willing to risk its own security
to defend its allies in Europe? What are the costs of sustaining the
**illusion of the US nuclear umbrella?**]{.underline} While these
questions retained an academic quality for some time, in the Age of
Trump, they urgently require revisiting.

Alliances under Anarchy: a Realist Take

Realism puts significant emphasis on self-help given the anarchical
setting of the International System. Cooperation is scarce and limited,
and only possible if states see it in their primal interest of survival
and quest for power. Nevertheless, [military alliances do happen and are
circumscribed in the theoretical postulations of
Realism]{.underline}---they last for as long as the states involved see
it as comparatively advantageous. In particular, [alliances are formed
to counter a third, more powerful, state]{.underline}.\[5\]

[The US nuclear umbrella]{.underline}, one of the crown jewels of NATO,
[relies heavily on]{.underline} the existence and
[credibility]{.underline} of military alliances. If the alliance fails,
so do the security assurances. In that sense, [even though military
alliances do exist, it seems almost **incredible** that,
under]{.underline} Deterrence and, therefore, [Realist logic, military
alliances would include credible nuclear security
assurances]{.underline}. In other words, following the Realist rationale
of self-help and its ultimate goal of survival, it seems highly unlikely
that a state would risk its own security and survival to come to the
defence of another state, ally or not, that is threatened by a third.

Historically, [military alliances based on mutual]{.underline}
assistance and [defence have proven to be nothing but **empty
promises**.]{.underline} In [1924, Czechoslovakia and
France]{.underline} signed the Treaty of Alliance and Friendship, which
stated that the two States would come to the other's aid in times of
peril.\[6\] In [1938]{.underline}, given the rise of tensions just
before the Second World War in Europe, [Czechoslovakia]{.underline} also
had a gentleman's agreement with the [United Kingdom]{.underline}
regarding the latter's aid in case of a military invasion of the former
by Germany.\[7\] However, when Germany invaded Czechoslovakia, neither
agreement was fulfilled, following several of the bedrock assumptions of
the Realist school of thought.

[Alliances]{.underline}, therefore, [are **susceptible to
failure**]{.underline}. As hard as it is for military alliances to
succeed, the nuclear age amplifies the obstacles for their endurance.
**[Even at the height of the Cold War]{.underline}**, inside the war
planning rooms of the Pentagon and the Strategic Air Command, [the
nuclear security assurances seemed to tremble. During the Berlin
Crisis]{.underline} of 1961, [top US officials were reconsidering
whether the United States should employ nuclear weapons to
defend]{.underline} an eventual military incursion of the USSR in
**[West Germany.\[]{.underline}**8\] Since the development of nuclear
weapons and the dominating logic of nuclear deterrence, [it is perfectly
reasonable to argue that security assurances in the nuclear age **are
quasi-empty words**]{.underline}. **[In 2020]{.underline}**, revisiting
the bases of the [US nuclear umbrella]{.underline}---particularly [in
Europe]{.underline}---**[does it still hold any value as a credible
security assurance]{.underline}**?

New York for Paris? The US Nuclear Umbrella Revisited

The strength of the US nuclear umbrella guarantee raised questions from
the very start, most notably from France. In the 1960s, General Charles
de Gaulle was highly sceptical of US nuclear security assurances,
particularly after the USSR developed intercontinental ballistic
missiles with enough range to reach the United States. This scepticism
led de Gaulle to pose the question whether US President John F. Kennedy
would be willing to risk **[New York for Paris]{.underline}**.
Eventually, [this very lack of confidence fomented the development of
**France's force de frappe**]{.underline}---the French nuclear arsenal
-- [allowing France to be able to protect itself and avoid a strict
dependency on NATO]{.underline}.\[9\]

The question posed by [de Gaulle summarises the central issues with the
credibility of US]{.underline} -- or any -- [nuclear
security]{.underline} assurances and [umbrellas]{.underline}. In 1970,
[given the USSR's massive conventional forces and its **nuclear parity**
with the US]{.underline}, President Richard M. [Nixon believed the
nuclear umbrella was no longer sustainable]{.underline}.\[10\] Despite
his beliefs, Nixon could not publicly admit the frailty of the US
nuclear umbrella lest it create anxieties in its European allies and
tampers with the Cold War balance.\[11\]

Fast forward to the present day, Donald Trump was elected President in
2016 with the slogan 'America First.' Ever since tensions have risen in
the nuclear sphere in multiple fronts. President Trump, echoing
President Harry S. Truman's words from 1945, famously threatened "fire
and fury" against North Korea and withdrew from the Iran Nuclear Deal.
Moreover, relations with Russia have also deteriorated after the mutual
withdrawal from the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty and the seemingly
unwillingness to extend New START---the only treaty remaining treaty
limiting US and Russia's nuclear arsenals---despite Russian President
Putin's positive signalling towards extension.

Similarly, President Trump has repeatedly shown his contempt for NATO,
after moving to cut US contributions to the organisation. Despite
Trump's increased reliance on nuclear weapons and desire of a larger
arsenal, it seems unlikely Trump and his 'America First' mentality would
risk New York -- or any other US city, for that matter---for Paris. [The
illusion of the US nuclear umbrella seems to be **surfacing at last.
On**]{.underline} the other side of the Atlantic, a recent poll
conducted by the Körber Foundation showed that [the German population
would **rather either rely on France and the United Kingdom** for
nuclear assurances or even forgo them than to rely on the US nuclear
umbrella]{.underline}. Notwithstanding[, hi]{.underline}gh-ranking
military officers seem to hold on to the current regime of nuclear
truth.

Sustaining the illusion of the US nuclear umbrella incurs other costs
whose effects have a global reach. [By perpetuating the current **regime
of nuclear truth**]{.underline}, [the US is selling its nuclear
umbrella, using it as a rock-solid **alibi to keep the United States
from abiding by its disarmament commitments**.]{.underline} Under
Article VI of the NPT, each State "\[...\] undertakes to pursue
negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation
of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear
disarmament".\[12\] One key-argument against US nuclear disarmament for
decades has been the anxieties it would create amongst its allies under
the US nuclear umbrella.

The nuclear [non-proliferation regime is]{.underline} already
**[strained]{.underline}** as it is. [Arms control seems to be
**failing**]{.underline} and non-nuclear weapons States are frustrated
with the slow pace of disarmament efforts. [The so-called 'grand
bargain' of the NPT]{.underline} -- non-proliferation in exchange for
nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and the promise of disarmament
[-- is in jeopardy. The maintenance and belief in the US **nuclear
umbrella**]{.underline} and the growing frustration from the non-nuclear
weapon States with its nuclear peers [coalesce in **existential
threats** to the **cornerstone treaty keeping nuclear proliferation at
bay**.]{.underline} [Were the **illusion of the umbrella** finally
exposed, it would eliminate a key hindrance to nuclear
disarmament.]{.underline}

[The US nuclear umbrella seems to have **lost its
credibility**]{.underline}. President Trump, in practicing his 'America
First' policy has opened the blinds showing the illusion of its nuclear
security assurances, particularly in the post-Cold War world. [The
dismantlement of the US nuclear umbrella]{.underline} -- being [replaced
by a European nuclear umbrella,]{.underline} led by France and the
United Kingdom, or eliminated completely -- [would likely **have no de
facto changes in** European security]{.underline}. Rather, it would
cripple to anti-disarmament movement in the United States. [The United
States is unlikely to risk New York for Paris, and its European allies
seem to **already know it.**]{.underline} [Waking up from this illusion
would create a more inviting environment for nuclear
disarmament.]{.underline}

Let's try to connect the dots. [Back in 2020]{.underline},
[when]{.underline} the [newbie European Commission]{.underline} [took
office]{.underline} [and there was no]{.underline} [war in
Ukraine]{.underline} [in the first place]{.underline}, [the EU
shockingly described [China "a systemic
rival".](https://europeansting.com/2020/06/23/on-the-22nd-china-eu-summit-negotiating-partner-economic-competitor-and-systemic-rival-is-this-the-right-eu-approach-to-address-its-2nd-biggest-trading-partner/)]{.underline} Two
years later and after a war of Russia in Ukraine the G7 countries
promulgated a \$600 billion plan to counter China's Belt and Road,
although they had all more or less benefited from it. Also, [G7 accused
China's stance]{.underline} at the "East and South China Seas". [And a
couple of days later]{.underline}, as if it was nicely planned, which it
was, [NATO came to officially name]{.underline} [China as a
challenge]{.underline} [for the many years to come]{.underline}. The dot
connection shows that the world had been trying to hurt China's rise in
global power already since 2020 when the freshman Commission called for
the first time in 50 years of productive diplomatic ties the country a
systemic rival, despite depending on its trade with the Asian giant in
order to prosper.

Not unexpectedly, [NATO's Cold War declaration]{.underline} [to
China]{.underline} **[infuriated the [Chinese
side](https://europeansting.com/2022/07/01/is-china-a-challenge-to-nato/)]{.underline}** [that
is feeling **more and more an unprovoked hostility**]{.underline} [by
the West]{.underline}. [Sure]{.underline}, [China has its own domestic
worries e.g.]{.underline} [Taiwan but did China]{.underline} [start the
blame game with the]{.underline} [West or **declared unprovoked a
Western country as challenge**]{.underline}? [What is NATO
aiming]{.underline} [for? To]{.underline} scare China, expand its
military business in the Asia-Pacific or threaten global security and
peace?

[The most likely]{.underline} [eventuality of the above can only be the
latter]{.underline}, [only that this is the]{.underline} [world's mere
biggest]{.underline} [accomplishment]{.underline} [since World War II.
The fact that **NATO doesn't seem to care for it anymore** and **starts
a new Cold War with gigantic China** is simply beyond
comprehension.]{.underline}

[Instead of the world trying to chill out,]{.underline} [recuperate
losses]{.underline} [from]{.underline} the war in [Ukraine]{.underline}
and the financial and health systems' catastrophe caused by the pandemic
and so many other curses, [the West goes back to zero sum
games]{.underline} in the 21st century [**that can blow up global peace
in less than a minute**. When will NATO]{.underline} and the peer [learn
from rich human history]{.underline}, the atrocity of global war
conflicts and the sheer vanity of human opportunism? Not quite soon
seems to be the answer, sadly.

against Moscow \-- [[as]{.mark} a **[reflection]{.mark}** [of **future
tensions**]{.mark} to come between the military bloc and Beijing in the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}. [Ever since Russian tanks **first crossed**
into Ukraine]{.underline} on February 24, [Beijing]{.underline} has
[walked an **awkward line** between not giving outright support to
Moscow]{.underline}\'s invasion [while accusing]{.underline} the
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and]{.underline} other
[NATO]{.underline} countries [of **provoking** the war by
allowing]{.underline} the [security alliance to **expand

[[as]{.mark} the war continues]{.underline} to grind on [with the
[Russia]{.mark}n military [suffering]{.mark} **[major

**[ramped up]{.mark}** its rhetoric to **[warn]{.mark}** [about]{.mark}
[NATO]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates\' [[**footprint** in
**Asia**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [\"[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}, a military

called [for **boosting NATO**]{.underline} in the wake of the Ukraine
war [and **warned China** that it should]{.underline} \"**[play by the
rules]{.underline}**.\" The added focus on NATO from Beijing comes as
both China and the United States see Russia\'s invasion as a foil for
future tensions between the two countries in Asia. NATO said last year
that it intended to focus more on China and Beijing is expected to play
a large role in the bloc\'s strategy moving forward. Likewise,
[[Washington]{.mark} is **increasingly convinced** that the conflict
provides it with an **unexpected advantage**]{.underline} in the long
term, with Bloomberg reporting on May 10 that [U.S. officials
[believe]{.mark} that **[bolstered]{.mark} [Eu]{.mark}ropean defense
[spending]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} a **[weakened]{.mark}
[Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline} could [[allow]{.mark} it to
[accelerate]{.mark} a **[security shift]{.mark}** [toward]{.mark}
[China]{.mark}]{.underline}. Those [[aims]{.mark} are [part of]{.mark}
the **[shared distrust]{.mark}** toward NATO and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [that has [led]{.mark} [**Beijing** and
**Moscow**]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [become]{.mark} **[closer]{.mark}** in
recent years]{.underline} and why many analysts believe that China has
not abandoned Russia throughout its brutal war in Ukraine. Similarly,
experts and [Western officials warn]{.underline} that [[Beijing]{.mark}
is **[closely watching]{.mark}** the [response]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[Russia]{.mark}\'s invasion [and]{.mark} [drawing]{.mark} **potential
[lessons]{.mark}** for any tensions [over
**Taiwan**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which China claims as its territory and
has threatened to invade if Taipei refuses to submit to its control.
\"If China joins the West in condemning Russia, it will be much
applauded in Washington and most European capitals. But it will lose
Russia\'s partnership,\" Senior Colonel Zhou Bo, a retired officer of
China\'s People\'s Liberation Army (PLA), wrote in The Economist on May
9. \"And it is only a matter of time before America takes on China

point out there are key differences between NATO\'s role and U.S.
strategy in the Indo-Pacific region, which also includes a wider range
of economic and political policies beyond the bloc and the United States
dealing with its long Pacific Ocean border. Still, the Ukraine war is
set to affect the region, with [[Chinese]{.mark} [Deputy]{.mark} Foreign

**[2NC \-- EU Army Works]{.underline}**

**Political will is key**

**Braw 22** \[Elisabeth Braw is a columnist at Foreign Policy and a
fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, 03-20-2022, Is an EU Army
Coming? -- Foreign Policy, archive.ph, https://archive.ph/oTCah\] Eric

Elisabeth Braw: The [[EU]{.mark} has [suddenly
emerged]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[as a serious
actor]{.underline}**]{.mark} in the security of Europe, [and EU
governments]{.underline} [are increasing defense spending]{.underline}.
Is the EU militarily stronger now than it was two months ago?

Claudio Graziano: Absolutely yes. [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[brought]{.mark} war [back to Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[which
was]{.underline} [something]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[so serious and
dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [it wasn't even considered
possible]{.underline}. [Even for people]{.underline} [who had read about
the risk]{.underline}, [it was impossible to believe it would
happen]{.underline}. When it did happen, it was a shock of immense
magnitude that provoked a huge common response from the European Union.

At the Versailles meeting \[on March 10-11\], the heads of state and
government discussed how the European Union can live up to its
responsibilities in this new reality. [[Doing so **requires a clear
political will,** and]{.mark} **[now the]{.mark} [E]{.mark}uropean
[U]{.mark}nion [is more united than ever]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} [This gives
an **incredible push to building a more concrete**]{.mark} [and credible
European defense union]{.mark}. And a defense union is really the only
possible answer to this crisis.]{.underline}

We know that's a long path, but we know that we have to do it now
because later will be too late. As part of this effort, we'll start
developing an EU Rapid Deployment Capacity that will give us the chance
to deploy a modular and multidomain force of up to 5,000 troops that can
intervene in nonpermissive \[hostile\] environments.

[This force]{.underline} [will also have strategic enablers]{.underline}
[that have in the]{.underline} [past normally been provided
by]{.underline} [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates---for
example, command and control structures, strategic airlift, strategic
transport, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities,
cyberdefense, unmanned air vehicles, space communication assets,
electronic warfare systems, anti-missile defense, and I hope in the near
future main battle tanks and next-generation fighter jets.

EB: But the [[EU]{.mark} **[already has
battlegroups]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that have never been
deployed]{.underline}. How can you be sure that this deployable force
will be successful when the battlegroups have not?

CG: [The EU battlegroups]{.underline} [are designed to be **used for
[stabilization]{.mark}**]{.underline} management \[crises less severe
than war\], and it's true that they've never been used. That's because
we never reached an agreement among the EU member states on certain
issues, such as cost and who was supposed to lead the effort. The other
complication was that they shouldn't compete with NATO. In the past, I
served in NATO missions for many years, including in Afghanistan, and
NATO does foreign deployments well. It also has at least nine rapid
reaction corps, and they're much bigger than the EU battlegroups. Our
new EU Rapid Deployment Capacity is an effort to answer a security need
without competing with NATO. But to be a real answer, the Deployment
Capacity must also be used in exercises. And having it on the roster
will send a message of European unity to Russia and others.

EB: Speaking of unity, Poland wants to give Ukraine its MiG-29 fighter
jets but doesn't want this to be just a Polish initiative. The United
States said no because it didn't want to be drawn into the war in the
active way that sending aircraft from Ramstein Air Base in Germany would
mean. Can the EU step in to help Ukraine now?

CG: The provision of combat aircraft is currently not on the agenda. But
you have to remember that on Feb. 27, only 72 hours after Russia's
invasion of Ukraine, [[the EU adopted]{.underline} [an **unprecedented
aid package**]{.underline}]{.mark} to help the Ukrainian armed forces
defend Ukraine's territory and population. [This aid package included
lethal weapons]{.underline}. **[[That's a
milestone!]{.underline}]{.mark}** It's even more than a historical
moment. Remember that in 2013 we weren't able to provide anything to
Mali. \[Editor's note: Despite having monitored the 2012 Islamist
takeover of the country's north closely, the EU failed to intervene
militarily. Instead, France launched an intervention in which it was
assisted by Germany, Denmark, and other EU member states.\]

Regarding lethal weapons, we're sending whatever the Ukrainians need
most---for example, ammunition and anti-tank weapons. This will help the
Ukrainians fight for freedom, and their will to do so is the most
important surprise in this war. Neither the Russians nor we probably
understood how far the Ukrainians would go to defend their freedom. It's
so different from Afghanistan this past summer, when we saw the Afghan
armed forces melt away.

EB: What is your own role in this growing military role the EU is taking
on? Does the Ukrainian government come to you directly with requests for
military assistance?

CG: It works a bit differently. The Ukrainians tell us what they need,
[the EU member states check]{.underline} [what they have
and]{.underline} [can give to the Ukrainians]{.underline}, [and
we---through the EU military]{.underline} staff ---[function as the
clearinghouse.]{.underline}

EB: One idea that keeps being floated in every discussion about the EU
and its military capabilities is the prospect of an EU Army. It's
clearly not feasible, especially considering that it has taken [Germany
and the Netherlands years of painstaking work to establish their joint
panzer
division](https://archive.ph/o/oTCah/https:/foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/09/to-deter-russia-europe-needs-more-military-integration/).
Short of complete military integration, what can the EU do to strengthen
its military capabilities, beyond increasing defense spending, of
course? As we know, countries like to spend money on weapons made by
their own companies.

CG: [Integrating armed forces]{.underline} [really is extremely
difficult]{.underline}, [but it's not impossible]{.underline}[. [**It
starts with the political will**.]{.underline}]{.mark} [But what we can
do first to strengthen our military capabilities is to improve
interoperability. After this war, we need to conclude that life won't be
as it was before and that we've made a backward leap of at least 70
years.]{.underline}

[Observers]{.underline} [are calling the Russian]{.underline} [invasion
of]{.underline} [Ukraine [**Europe's
"9/11**,"](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/28/putins-war-ukraine-europe-hard-power/)]{.underline} [and
the E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion's [immediate
reaction]{.underline} **[a [Copernican
revolution](https://euobserver.com/opinion/154453)]{.underline}**. This
past weekend saw the [EU's typical doctrine]{.underline} [of slow
process]{.underline} [and indecisiveness **go out the
window**]{.underline}. At long last, [the EU **acted as a geopolitical
force**]{.underline} [to be reckoned with]{.underline} - [at least by
Russia]{.underline}. After an initially slow start, [the
E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [demonstrated **an abrupt
U-turn** in security policy and is finally acting like a great power
capable]{.underline} [of projecting influence.]{.underline}

The conflict in Ukraine has stirred the emergence of a newly awakened
European Union that [is willing to provide arms]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} seriously rethink [its security posture.]{.underline}
For the first time ever, [the EU **will purchase and provide
weapons**]{.underline} [and equipment to a warzone]{.underline}
[with [its
announcement](https://www.euronews.com/2022/02/27/eu-to-buy-and-deliver-weapons-to-ukraine-the-first-time-the-bloc-has-financed-military-sup) of
**€450 million in weapons for Ukraine**]{.underline}. [The EU is
shutting down]{.underline} [its]{.underline} [airspace to
Russian]{.underline} [planes]{.underline}, [including private
jets]{.underline} [chartered by oligarchs]{.underline}. [It]{.underline}
[also banned all Russian-owned media]{.underline} [and froze Russian
bank assets]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} [sanctions against Russia
and the]{.underline} [support for Ukraine]{.underline} [were a result of
swift decision-making]{.underline}, and for good reason--because for the
first time in 30 years Europe's security order is under attack. [War in
Europe was]{.underline} [something unimaginable]{.underline} for the
post-Cold War generation, [but Russia shattered any illusions of
peace]{.underline} when it invaded Ukraine and made it easy for all EU
members to take a stance against Putin's attack. Very rarely has a
conflict ever been as a black-and-white, with aggressor and defender
clearly identifiable. After much soul-searching in Europe's capitals,
leaders and citizens reached the obvious conclusion: economic
appeasement of Russia had completely failed to deter Russian
aggression - in fact, it only galvanized Putin's military action.

Within the European bloc, [Germany showed the biggest]{.underline}
about-[face]{.underline}. In just a few short days, [Germany's
approach]{.underline} to defense issues and its relations [with Russia
**dramatically shifted.**]{.underline} The new Chancellor Olaf Scholz
announced the [German]{.underline} government [will send **1,000
anti-tank weapons**]{.underline} [and 500 Stinger]{.underline}
[anti-aircraft defense]{.underline} [systems]{.underline} to
Ukraine, [reversing its historic
policy](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-war-russia-germany-still-blocking-arms-supplies/) of
never sending weapons to conflict zones. He committed Germany to
spending more than 2 percent of its GDP on the military, a new high
water mark for defense spending and hitting the NATO benchmark. And
Germany suspended the controversial Nordstream 2 gas pipeline from
Russia. Although many of these policy changes may seem like Germany
simply coming around to better alignment with the West, [it reflects a
dramatic upheaval of decades of foreign policy and
precedent]{.underline}.

[Far from "brain]{.underline} [dead]{.underline}", as [it was
declared]{.underline} in 2019 [by]{.underline} French President Emmanuel
[Macron]{.underline}, [Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} [has
**reinvigorated the alliance for decades** to come]{.underline}. This is
apparent by the dramatic shift in popularity for joining the alliance on
display in Finland and Sweden. For the first time, [support for Finland
to join the NATO alliance]{.underline} **[[exceeded 50
percent](https://www.jpost.com/international/article-699006).]{.underline}**
And the European [Union's own efforts to create a defensive]{.underline}
[union]{.underline}, [one that would run parallel to NATO without
duplication]{.underline}, [**saw its first ever action** through [the
deployment of a cyber

[Despite Chinese military]{.underline} [threats]{.underline}, [the
E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion has [pledged]{.underline} [its
support for Taiwan]{.underline}, [causing concerns]{.underline} [among
Chinese officials]{.underline}, according to local
media, ANI reported. [Taiwan\'s]{.underline} Foreign
[Minister]{.underline} Joseph Wu [travelled to Europe]{.underline} just
days after the [E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion **[reaffirmed
its support for Taiwan]{.underline}**. [Beijing was
infuriated]{.underline} since the minister\'s trip to Europe gave a
clear message that the EU is standing with the US, Japan, and Australia,
which have been attempting to corner China on a number of problems, and
supporting Taiwan, including human rights breaches and territorial
expansions, according to the international think tank, International
Forum for Rights and Security (IFFRAS).

[Taiwan\'s allies]{.underline}, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and]{.underline} [Japan]{.underline}, [have been
increasing their engagement]{.underline} [with the democratic island
nation]{.underline} in order to assist it [to defend itself against a
growing threat]{.underline} from China, **[putting Beijing in a
difficult position]{.underline}**. In terms of involvement and support
from regional partners, [Taiwan has had a reasonably positive
month]{.underline}. The US President Joe Biden and his Japanese
counterpart, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, issued a joint statement in
April that underscored the importance of peace and stability across the
Taiwan Strait and support the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait
disputes.

**[EU hinted the change in its policy toward Beijing]{.underline}**

[China\'s expanding]{.underline} [domination]{.underline} and military
transgressions in the region [have been criticised by]{.underline}
[major democracies]{.underline} throughout the world. In such a
scenario, **[the EU\'s intervention]{.underline}** **[has put a stop to
Beijing\'s plans to annex Taiwan]{.underline}**, according to
IFFRAS, ANI reported. Weeks ago, [the EU had also hinted at the change
in its policy
toward]{.underline} [Beijing]{.underline} [after]{.underline} European
[Commission]{.underline} Executive Vice-President, Margrethe
[Vestager]{.underline} [expressed
solidarity with]{.underline} [Lithuania stating that the EU will
continue to push back at these attempts and adopt appropriate tools,
such as the anti-coercion instrument, currently under preparation,
according to ANI reports.]{.underline}

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is the most successful
military alliance in modern history. For 40 years, [NATO]{.underline}
[protected Western Europe]{.underline} [from the hostile might of
the]{.underline} [Soviet Union]{.underline} [until]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} ideologically driven
[empire [collapsed](https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/fall-of-soviet-union) in
1990]{.underline}. Victory in the Cold War, however, would be the
beginning of the end for NATO, an alliance that has outlived its time
and today is an expanded membership group of disparate nation-states
unable to agree on its current purposes.  

[The [72-year-old
alliance](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_67656.htm)]{.underline} **[has
become the victim of its own success]{.underline}** and the simple
passage of time. In NATO's heyday, the glue that held it together was a
very realistic fear of Soviet Russia and its immense military
establishment. [Now most members of NATO do not]{.underline} [feel
threatened]{.underline} [by]{.underline} today's post-communist
[Russia]{.underline} --- [and]{.underline} worse, **[feel little
inclination to militarily support]{.underline}** the **[few "frontline"
states]{.underline}** (e.g., Poland, the three Baltic nations) that do
feel threatened. 

[Polls]{.underline} in recent years [confirm this new
reality]{.underline}. In 2015, a [Pew Research Center
poll](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/nato-publics-reluctant-to-provide-military-aid-to-allies-under-attack/) found
that, [among NATO members]{.underline}, [only in the United States and
Canada did a majority support]{.underline} [military force]{.underline}
[to aid a NATO member]{.underline} [that was invaded.]{.underline}
Earlier this year, the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR)
polled 60,000 people in its 11-member states and found that, by margins
well over 2 to1, public opinion believes that their countries [should
remain
neutral](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/09/22/europeans-want-to-stay-out-of-the-new-cold-war/) in
conflicts between the U.S. and Russia or China. 

[These sentiments]{.underline} **[flatly contradict the core tenet of
the NATO Treaty]{.underline}**
--- [**[Article5]{.underline}**](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm),
which obligates all members to militarily support a member who is under
attack. If European NATO members prefer to remain neutral in any
Russia-America conflict, what is the point of the alliance from the
United States's perspective? Add to this the fact that almost all
European NATO members long have
been [defaulting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/videopolitics/trump-nato-members-havent-been-even-close-to-meeting-financial-obligations/2017/02/06/4cd31a8e-ec9e-11e6-a100-fdaaf400369a_video.html?deferJs=true&outputType=default-article) on
the financial obligations required by the treaty, and American
skepticism about NATO in recent years is entirely understandable.

[The seeds of NATO's decline]{.underline} [were sown **at the moment of
the alliance's greatest triumph**]{.underline}, and the context was the
issue of NATO expansion into the former Soviet satellites. The not
unreasonable view of former Soviet leader [Mikhail
Gorbachev,](https://thehill.com/people/mikhail-gorbachev/) and later
former Russian President [Boris
Yeltsin,](https://thehill.com/people/boris-yeltsin/) was that with the
Cold War over, the Soviet-sponsored [Warsaw
Pact](https://www.nato.int/cps/us/natohq/declassified_138294.htm#:~:text=The%20Warsaw%20Pact%20was%20a,(Albania%20withdrew%20in%201968).) dissolved,
and with an economically prostrate Russia struggling to become a
democracy, there was no justification for expanding a Western military
alliance hundreds of miles closer to the Russian border.  

Initially, Presidents Bush and Clinton seemed to agree. Then-U.S.
Secretary of State James Baker assured Gorbachev in February 1990 that
NATO wouldn't move "[one inch
eastward](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/russia-programs/2017-12-12/nato-expansion-what-gorbachev-heard-western-leaders-early)."
In October 1993, Clinton's Secretary of State Warren Christopher assured
Yeltsin that there would be no NATO expansion, but instead a new
organization, "[Partnership for
Peace](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/russia-programs/2018-03-16/nato-expansion-what-yeltsin-heard),"
that would include all of the former satellite states and Russia as
well. Yeltsin enthusiastically embraced this concept. However, his fury
knew no bounds a year later when Clinton reversed course, expanded NATO
to include the satellites and excluded Russia. Yeltsin insisted that
what was agreed upon was "[Partnership for all, not NATO for
some](https://warontherocks.com/2019/11/promises-made-promises-broken-what-yeltsin-was-told-about-nato-in-1993-and-why-it-matters-2/)"
and he spoke of betrayal and the purposeful humiliation of a weakened
Russia. From the sidelines, Gorbachev lamented the rejection of his
concept of a "[common European
home](https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2019/jul/10/gorbachev-vision-for-a-common-european-home--july-1989)."

[This toxic issue has haunted relations]{.underline} [between Russia and
the West ever]{.underline} [since]{.underline}, and became particularly
dangerous when President [George W.
Bush ](https://thehill.com/people/george-w-bush-2/)said in April 2008
that he "[strongly
supported](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/01/nato.georgia)"
NATO membership for Georgia and Ukraine and wouldn't accept any Russian
attempt to veto this. Bush's proposal, however, was strongly rebuffed by
six NATO members led by Germany's Angela Merkel, who called such NATO
expansion "needlessly provocative." An outraged Russian
President [Vladimir
Putin ](https://thehill.com/people/vladimir-putin/)declared that NATO
membership for Georgia and Ukraine was a direct threat to Russia's
national security and he viewed it as a "red line" that could not be
crossed. 

Putin further countered by becoming involved in the savage ethnic
politics of Georgia by supporting dissident separatist groups in
Abkhazia and South Ossetia and ultimately recognizing them as
independent republics backed economically and militarily by Russia. In
2014, when Western-backed mass protests led to the overthrow of a
pro-Russian president of Ukraine, Putin [acted
swiftly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_pro-Russian_unrest_in_Ukraine) to
intervene militarily in those areas of Eastern Ukraine whose inhabitants
were largely Russian ethnically (Crimea 65 percent) or Russian-speaking
(Donbas 70 percent).

It is ironic that, with all its internal problems, NATO should
be [pursuing](https://www.voanews.com/a/europe_72-nato-alliance-faces-new-challenges-enduring-threats/6204263.html) high-risk
policies on behalf of countries that are not NATO members; are not
allies; and assuredly would bring far more burdens to the alliance than
assets. As for the United States, which has seriously damaged itself
through long wars in distant places, why would we be risking more of the
same in places so little-connected to our true national interests?

Thank You Corey and thanks to the Atlantic Council and Charles Koch
Institute is NATO still relevant relevant to whom I would ask and so I
want to make clear that I\'m arguing about NATO\'s collective relevancy
for all of its members and I would argue that [[NATO is in danger
of]{.underline} [becoming irrelevant because it
**lacks**]{.underline}]{.mark} a [**[strategic
focus]{.mark}**]{.underline} already you can probably tell [that my
argument in my decision]{.underline} shares much in common [with the
French]{.underline} [president\'s brain death sentiments]{.underline}
from last winter [**[a club whose members can\'t]{.underline}** **[agree
on the purpose of the club]{.underline}**]{.mark} [who]{.underline}
[each **want and expect different things**]{.underline} [from the club
[is a club that is in]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[trouble]{.underline}]{.mark} so NATO is in danger of losing its
collective relevancy for all of its members I would argue because it
suffers from a strategic deficit the central question as I see it is
what is NATO\'s purpose today [[during the Cold War it had]{.underline}
[a]{.underline}]{.mark} [very clear and [defined]{.mark}
[purpose]{.mark}]{.underline} it was [to [deter]{.underline}]{.mark}
[and defend against [the Soviet]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[Union]{.underline}]{.mark} since the 1990s NATO has been engaged in
never-ending transformations starting with the 1991 strategic concept
where we saw the adoption of two new security mandates for NATO we get
projecting stability and crisis management cooperative security along
[[with an open door to enlargement]{.mark}]{.underline} and I would
argue that [[the net result has been]{.underline} [mission
creep]{.underline}]{.mark} [for NATO so]{.underline} [[NATO gets
into]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[peacekeeping]{.underline}]{.mark}
business NATO gets into admittedly at the request of the Americans that
[counterterrorism]{.underline} the
[[nation-building]{.underline}]{.mark} business NATO gets into the
security suspect er reform business you know gets into the [counter
[piracy]{.mark}]{.underline} and fighting [illegal]{.underline}
[[migration]{.underline}]{.mark} business there are even those who now
argue that NATO is ideally situated for tackling [organised
crime]{.underline} [and corruption]{.underline} so [the result is
that]{.underline} [[members want and expect different
things]{.underline}]{.mark} [from NATO they no longer see eye to
eye]{.underline} and here I think the clearest example of this is with
respect to Russia we have [the classic split in the
alliance]{.underline} [between the eastern and southern]{.underline}
[flank but we also have a NATO member]{.underline} [[Turkey who\'s
purchasing]{.underline}]{.mark} men [[weapon]{.underline} [systems from
Russia]{.underline} [and attempting to block the defense plan for the
Baltics]{.underline}]{.mark} on the other hand we have countries like
[[France]{.mark} which is]{.underline} [[exploring rapprochement]{.mark}
wi]{.underline}th the Russians so there\'s a lack of consensus about the
strategic purpose and [this [lack of consensus about
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} strategic purpose **[[jeopardizes its future
relevancy]{.underline}]{.mark}** I would argue the last point I want to
make here is that [[the strategic crisis]{.underline}]{.mark} the
strategic deficit that NATO faces today **[[predates]{.mark} President
[Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}** and his administration so I think [it\'s a
mistake to assume that come January 2021 if]{.underline} [there\'s a
change in occupanc]{.underline}y in the White House that [NATO can just
go back]{.underline} [to norm]{.underline}al a return to normal back to
business as usual I don\'t see that happening because for me \$question
NATO needs to deal with that the members need to address is what is it
NATO\'s purpose.

**NATO commitments unsustainable because of the rise of china.**

grand strategy: a net assessment," *International Politics,* Vol 57, Iss

Some aver that alliance relations will revert to normal should President
Trump depart the White House in 2021. But they forget [that US [concerns
about]{.mark} the relative [contribution of]{.mark} the
[Europe]{.mark}ans [are **long-standing**]{.mark}]{.underline}, harking
back to the 1960s. Moreover, these [[concerns are likely to intensify as
the US]{.mark}A [faces]{.mark} economic constraints]{.underline} ([the
[colossal]{.mark} national [debt]{.mark}]{.underline} and soaring budget
defcits---[[especially]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
[[post-COVID]{.underline}-]{.mark}19 world) [[and]{.mark}
long-[neglected domestic problems increase disaffection]{.mark} among
[Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since the early decades of NATO,
European countries have become economic competitors of the USA and
[neomercantilists and [populists]{.mark} in the USA [have become more
vocal]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[in Democratic as well as Republican
ranks]{.mark}. US [leaders will ratchet up pressure on NATO]{.mark}
allies [to assume]{.mark}]{.underline} more of [[the burden of
collective defense]{.underline}]{.mark}---and **[[NATO may not survive
if Europe does nothing more than tinker]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
response. Moreover, [[the rise of China will inevitably divert]{.mark}
US military [resources]{.mark} from Europe]{.underline}. In short,
[[Trump's departure]{.mark} in 2021 or 2025 [won't restore the status
quo]{.mark} ante for NATO]{.underline}, at least not for long (Becker
2017; Menon 2007; NATO 1995; Putin 2007; Ruger 2017, 2019; Shlapak and

When More Is Less, and Less Is More [[For an alliance]{.mark} that has
long [prided]{.mark} itself [on]{.mark} its [commonality of purpose and
interests]{.mark}, the truth is that **[NATO is]{.mark} in danger of
[losing both]{.mark}.**]{.underline} On paper and in public, the members
still agree the core purpose of the 71-year-old alliance is deterrence
and defense of the North Atlantic region. When internal disagreements
are aired publicly, other allies are quick to dispel reports of rifts by
pointing out that differences of opinion are nothing new. [But unlike
during the Cold War]{.underline}, when a single adversary occupied all
of the alliance's attention, [today's security environment]{.underline}
--- as the allies routinely remind each other --- [is **multifaceted and
complex**]{.underline}. In an effort to address members' often disparate
security requirements, [NATO has taken on additional tasks]{.underline}
over the past three decades almost [as quickly as it has taken on
additional members. The **[NATO-ization of every security
challenge]{.mark}** has [meant]{.mark} that [issues]{.mark} once
[considered the purview of]{.mark} individual nations or [other]{.mark}
international [organizations]{.mark}]{.underline} --- such as migration,
terrorism, and foreign security force assistance --- [are now [**lumped
onto NATO's agenda under the guise** of fulfilling its]{.mark} ambitious
(and potentially [limitless]{.mark}) post-Cold War [mandate]{.mark} of
"projecting stability." For far too long now, alliance [leaders]{.mark}
have [tasked]{.mark} the [NATO]{.mark} military infrastructure
[with]{.mark} a seemingly **[impossible undertaking]{.mark}: weighing
down the military organization with new responsibilities**]{.underline}
like peacekeeping and counter-terrorism while simultaneously allowing
members to shirk on contributing the resources required to fulfill old
and new alliance missions. To date, much of the criticism surrounding
NATO's current strategic deadlock has focused on the resource issue and
the strains caused by uneven burden-sharing within the alliance. [**Far
less attention** has been paid to the first part of the
"ends-means-ways" formulation of strategy, namely **NATO's original
purpose**]{.underline}. While addressing "means" and "ways" are crucial
elements in any strategic enterprise, it is past time the Allies got
around to focusing on NATO's strategic ends once more.

**[2NC -- Sustainability -- Afghanistan]{.underline}**

**Afghanistan destroys the global credibility of NATO.**

**Kulikov 21** \[Valery Kulikov is a political expert at New Age,

[THE shameful events]{.underline} [in Afghanistan]{.underline} in recent
weeks have **[led to a dramatic loss of credibility]{.underline}** for
the United States and NATO in the minds of the Western public. The
[earlier]{.underline} [criticism]{.underline} [of the Atlantic
Alliance's]{.underline} [policies]{.underline} and actions **[has now
increased enormously]{.underline}** [and has become the most widespread
meme]{.underline} [in the publications of various media]{.underline}.

The mournful announcement of the British Daily Mail is more
straightforward than ever. Next to the image of a coffin covered in the
national flag, is posed a question Britain has never been able to
answer: what, in the end, did they all die for in Afghanistan?

The British TV channel Sky rightly points out that after the withdrawal
of Soviet troops in 1989, the official government of Afghanistan endured
for three years, and after the US withdrawal it did not last even three
hours.

[The seizure of power]{.underline} [in Afghanistan]{.underline} [by the
Taliban]{.underline} (banned in Russia) **[is a grave
disgrace]{.underline}** [and a shameful defeat for NATO]{.underline},
believes the Swiss TV channel SRF. One of the Alliance's grandest
projects of the past two decades has been brought to an ignominious
grave. [Western countries]{.underline} **[have failed to build democracy
in Afghanistan, and now they refuse to even address the future of the
country and its people.]{.underline}**

NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg is not cut out for big speeches;
indeed, even when he has something positive to say, he gives, to put it
mildly, 'an excessively reserved impression', writes a diplomatic
correspondent of the Swiss TV channel SRF. When Stoltenberg was finally
confronted about the failure of the Western military alliance in
Afghanistan, he looked deeply broken and depressed.

As the Wall Street Journal points out, [Biden's '**disgraceful
departure'**]{.underline} from Afghanistan **[was a slap in the face for
NATO]{.underline}**. Following the 9/11 attacks, when the Collective
Defence Clause was invoked for the first time in history in Afghanistan,
America's allies in the Alliance have shed much blood in that country,
spent vast sums of money in the conflict, and lost more than a thousand
people. The newspaper stresses that Washington almost mocked its
partners when in his speech about the withdrawal of troops Biden only
briefly mentioned NATO and did not say a word about the European allies
of the United States. So it is not surprising that European leaders are
seething with anger, concludes The Wall Street Journal.

In his time, French president Emmanuel [Macron]{.underline} [was met
with a barrage of criticism]{.underline} [when he spoke of NATO as
'brain dead' in]{.underline} 2019. [But it was then that]{.underline}
[he warned that no matter who]{.underline} [was in charge of the United
States, it]{.underline} [was becoming an increasingly less dependable
ally]{.underline}. And today, [Macron's words **seem nothing short of
prophetic**]{.underline} throughout the European capitals.

For Europe, the Taliban's seizure of power in Afghanistan is an
unmitigated nightmare, writes Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten. First of
all, because [the US has shown through its hasty]{.underline}
[withdrawal]{.underline} that **[it no longer intends to defend the
'free world']{.underline}**, [and without American support]{.underline}
**[Europe does not have enough strength to defend itself]{.underline}**,
and this catastrophic deficit is unlikely to be eliminated soon.

**[2NC -- Sustainability -- Trump]{.underline}**

**Trump solidified NATO's doom. It zeroes their offense but EU
leadership is now necessary more than ever.**

MADRID -- [NATO]{.underline} may be "the most successful alliance in
history" -- as its secretary-general, Jens
Stoltenberg, [claims](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2019/03/14/how-nato-is-shaping-up-at-70) --
but it [may]{.underline} also **[be on the brink of
failure.]{.underline}** After a turbulent few years, during which US
President Donald [Trump]{.underline} has **[increasingly turned
America's back on NATO]{.underline}**, [tensions]{.underline} between
France and Turkey **[have escalated sharply]{.underline}**,
[laying]{.underline} [bare just how fragile]{.underline} [the Alliance
has become.]{.underline}

The[ [Franco-Turkish
spat](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-france-turkey-analysis/france-turkey-tensions-mount-after-nato-naval-incident-idUSKBN2481K5)]{.underline} [began
in mid-June]{.underline}, when a French navy frigate under NATO command
in the Mediterranean attempted to inspect a cargo vessel suspected of
violating a United Nations arms embargo on Libya.
[France]{.underline} [[alleges]{.underline}](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-france-turkey/nato-to-investigate-mediterranean-incident-between-french-turkish-warships-idUSKBN23P2SJ) that
[three Turkish ships accompanying]{.underline} [the cargo vessel
were]{.underline} "**[extremely aggressive]{.underline}**" toward its
frigate, flashing their radar lights three times -- [a signal indicating
imminent engagement]{.underline}. Turkey denied France's account,
claiming that the French frigate was harassing its ships.

[Whatever the details]{.underline}, [the fact is that two NATO
allies]{.underline} [came very close to exchanging]{.underline} [fire in
the context of a NATO mission]{.underline}. [That is a new low for the
Alliance]{.underline} -- one that may herald its demise.

Lord Hastings Ismay, NATO's first secretary-general, famously quipped
that the Alliance's mission was to "keep the Russians out, the Americans
in, and the Germans down." The dynamic obviously changed over the
subsequent decades, especially the relationship with Germany. But the
broad basis of cooperation -- a common perceived threat, strong American
leadership, and a shared sense of purpose -- remained the same.

Without US leadership, the whole structure is at risk of crumbling. It
is no coincidence that the last time two NATO allies came this close to
blows -- during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 -- the US was
preoccupied with the Vietnam War. In fact, the spat between Turkey and
France occurred just days after it
was [revealed](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-directs-u-s-troop-reduction-in-germany-11591375651?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=2) that
Trump had decided, without any prior consultation with America's NATO
allies, to withdraw thousands of US troops from Germany.

Germany may no longer be on the front line, as it was during the Cold
War, but US forces there still serve as a powerful deterrent to Russian
aggression along NATO's eastern flank. By drawing down those forces,
Trump has sent a fundamental message: ensuring European security is no
longer a top US priority.

[While America's drift away]{.underline} [from Europe has accelerated
under]{.underline} [Trump]{.underline}, [it began over a decade
earlier]{.underline}. [In 2011,]{.underline} [when Trump's

"pivot to]{.underline} [Asia]{.underline}," [then]{.underline}-US
Secretary of Defense Robert
[Gates]{.underline} [[warned](https://archive.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=4839) that]{.underline},
[unless NATO proved itself relevant]{.underline}, [the US may lose
interest.]{.underline} NATO did no such thing: until last December, its
summit declarations failed even
to [acknowledge](https://www.dw.com/en/nato-recognizes-china-challenges-for-the-first-time/a-51519351) the
challenges posed by China's rise. By then, the US had lost interest. And
now, [under Trump]{.underline}, [that disinterest has become open
hostility.]{.underline}

[Without the US as a rudder]{.underline}, NATO allies have begun to head
off in different directions. Turkey is the clearest example. Before the
recent squabble with France,
Turkey [purchased](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/13/europe/turkey-russia-missiles-nato-analysis-intl/index.html) a
Russian S-400 missile-defense system, despite US objections. Moreover,
it has brazenly intervened in Libya, providing air support, weapons, and
fighters to the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan seems confident that his [direct
relationship](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/29/politics/trump-phone-calls-national-security-concerns/index.html) with
Trump will protect him from suffering any consequences for his behavior.
Trump's decision not to impose sanctions over the missile purchase,
beyond cutting Turkey's participation in the F-35 fighter jet program,
seems to vindicate Erdoğan's reasoning.

But Turkey is not alone in striking out on its own; France has done the
same, including in Libya. By providing military support to the
Russian-backed General Khalifa Haftar, who controls eastern Libya, to
fight Islamist militants, France has gone against its NATO allies. While
President [Emmanuel
Macron](https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/emmanuel-macron)[denies](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/07/01/world/middleeast/01reuters-libya-security-turkey-france.html) supporting
Haftar's side in the civil war, he did recently express support for
Egypt's pledge to intervene militarily against Turkey, which he says has
a "criminal responsibility" in the country.

As tensions with Turkey rise, France is more insistent than ever that a
European approach to security and defense -- one that would be de
facto led by France -- is vital. The fact that popular support for
Macron within France
is [waning](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election/frances-macron-takes-drubbing-in-local-elections-greens-surge-idUSKBN23Z007) only
augments his sense of urgency.

Political motivations aside, Macron has [said
aloud](https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/11/07/emmanuel-macron-warns-europe-nato-is-becoming-brain-dead) what
few others have acknowledged: NATO is experiencing "brain death," owing
to Trump's dubious commitment to defend America's allies. Given that the
US drift away from NATO began well before Trump, there is little reason
to believe that this trend will be reversed, though it may be slowed if
he loses the November election. Unless Europe begins thinking of itself
as a geopolitical power and takes responsibility for its own security,
Macron argues, it will "no longer be in control of \[its\] destiny."

Last December, NATO commemorated 70 years of underpinning peace,
stability, and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. But cracks in
the Alliance are deepening, raising serious doubts about whether it will
reach its 75th anniversary. The time for Europe to shore up its defenses
and capabilities is now.

[The secretary general]{.underline} [of the]{.underline} North Atlantic
Treaty Organization ([NATO]{.underline}), Jens Stoltenberg, [recently
announced]{.underline} the [US-led military bloc's]{.underline} [goal of
expanding]{.underline} [its so-called 'Response Force']{.underline}
[from its current strength]{.underline} [of 40,000]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} a force of more than [300,000 troops]{.underline}. "We
will enhance our battlegroups in the eastern part of the Alliance up to
brigade-levels," Stoltenberg declared. "We will transform the NATO
Response Force and increase the number of our high readiness forces to
well over 300,000."

[The announcement]{.underline}, made at the end of NATO's annual summit,
held in Madrid, Spain, apparently **[took several defense
officials]{.underline}** [from the NATO **membership by
surprise**]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} [one]{.underline} [such
official]{.underline} [calling]{.underline} Stoltenberg's
[figures]{.underline} **["number magic."]{.underline}**
[Stoltenberg]{.underline} [appeared to be working]{.underline} [from a
concept]{.underline} [that had been developed]{.underline} [within NATO
headquarters]{.underline} [based]{.underline} [upon assumptions
made]{.underline} [by his staffers]{.underline}, [as opposed to anything
resembling]{.underline} [coordinated policy]{.underline} among the
defense organizations of the 30 nations that make up the bloc.

**[Confusion is the name of the game]{.underline}** [at NATO these
days]{.underline}, [with the alliance still reeling]{.underline} [from
last year's Afghan debacle and unable to adequately disguise the
impotence]{.underline} [shown in the face of Russia's ongoing military
operation in Ukraine]{.underline}. [The bloc **is but a shadow of its
former self, a pathetic collection of under-funded military
organizations**]{.underline} **[more suited for the parade ground than
the battlefield]{.underline}**. No military organization more represents
this colossal collapse in credibility and capability than the British
Army.

But **[what each enlargement failed]{.underline}** [to
achieve]{.underline} [and what the entry of Sweden and]{.underline}
[Finland will miss too]{.underline} [is to reduce Nato's **overwhelming
dependence**]{.underline} [on the]{.underline} contribution of the
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. The transatlantic alliance
reacted well in response to Russia's invasion
of [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine). Since March,
[Nato has not only been present]{.underline} [with multinational battle
groups]{.underline} [in]{.underline} [the Baltic states and
Poland,]{.underline} [but also in Slovakia,]{.underline}
[Hungary]{.underline}, [Romania and Bulgaria]{.underline}. [The Nato
presence **stretches from the Baltic Sea to the Black
Sea**]{.underline}. The military alliance has also increased the number
of soldiers on the ground. Around 10,000 of the 40,000 Nato soldiers are
divided among eight battle groups. The battle groups are equipped with
different units geared to the respective location's military needs.
**[Each battlegroup is led by a different nation]{.underline}**,
providing the bulk of the troops.

Yet, although many allies have brought in beneficial assets, [the US
contribution **dwarfs**]{.underline} that of **[all the Europeans put
together]{.underline}**. Had it not been for the fact that [US troops in
Europe](https://www.stripes.com/theaters/europe/2022-03-15/us-forces-record-high-europe-war-ukraine-5350187.html) now
number 100,000 -- the highest figure since the mid-1990s -- it's
doubtful that the alliance could have presented such a united front.

Recent pledges to boost defence spending have also been impressive. But,
at least for the moment, only [nine of the 30
members](https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-8175/CBP-8175.pdf) dedicate
2% of their GDP to defence, and those who fail to reach this threshold
include big European nations such as France, Germany, Italy and Spain.
The rest, as they say, remains a "work in progress".

Nato calculates that its members have promised to spend £172.6bn
in [additional defence
expenditure](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/29/remarks-by-president-charles-michel-before-the-nato-summit-in-madrid/) on
top of existing defence budgets, with Germany accounting for perhaps
half this amount. But the question is how this will be spent and over
what period. The easiest way to improve European capabilities would be
to use this cash to buy US equipment off the shelf: this offers
substantial economies of scale and time. Yet such an approach will go
against European aspirations to boost their defence industries; French
diplomats are warning that the Ukraine war must not end up as a bonanza
for US arms manufacturers. Chances are high that Nato's eternal
"burden-sharing" debate will continue, even if more cash is available.
Across the Atlantic, Donald Trump and his disciples are poised to argue
-- as "The Donald" did when he was in the White House -- that Nato is a
scam to fleece American taxpayers. Even if he does not stage a comeback,
the idea that the US is spending far more than it should to defend fat,
wealthy Europeans is likely to feature prominently when a new Congress
is elected this November.

The sheer audacity of the Russian aggression has allowed the Biden
administration to get the cash it needed from Congress. Still, it is
taken for granted in Washington that the [\$40bn
package](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/may/16/us-ukraine-aid-bill-vote-joe-biden-baby-formula-inflation-latest-news) recently
approved by Congress for security assistance to Ukraine is unlikely to
be repeated. And a future Nato burden-sharing debate is bound to get
more acrimonious when it is joined with a parallel discussion about
paying for Ukraine's postwar economic reconstruction, a project
estimated at an eye-watering \$500bn.

Nato has also set itself a huge objective by pledging to increase the
number of high-readiness forces to more than 300,000. For this still
does not answer the fundamental question of whether, to deter further
Russian aggression, the alliance must position significant forces in the
countries near Russia permanently. Not doing so could expose existing
Nato members to the danger of a Russian occupation for at least a period
until help arrives to liberate them, a risk that, given the [horrors of
Bucha](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/ukraine-crisis-bucha-killings-soldiers/),
no alliance nation is ready to contemplate. But keeping multinational
troops deployed permanently in central and eastern Europe will be hugely
expensive, well beyond current raised spending plans.

In effect, all that Nato has done in Madrid is to issue a promissory
note on this score in the hope that both the nature of the promise and
the conditions of its redemption could be discussed later. Yet the
biggest paradox for the alliance is that the glue that holds it so
solidly together -- the determination to stand up to Russia's imperial
intentions -- remains its most significant vulnerability. Despite all
the back-slapping in Madrid there is no consensus on how to deal
with [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia). Everyone agrees
that it must not be allowed to succeed in its current aggression. But
does this mean that it should be physically defeated on the battlefield
in Ukraine, as Britain and most of the central and eastern Europeans are
arguing, or would it be enough if the war ends without Moscow being able
to make a plausible claim to victory, as Germany's leaders would prefer?

For now, this debate seems abstract. But the moment Moscow hints that it
wants a ceasefire in Ukraine, all these differing opinions within Nato
will come into the open. Nato's [new [Strategic
Concept](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2022/6/pdf/290622-strategic-concept.pdf) ]{.underline}adopted

In the aftermath of Russia's immoral invasion of Ukraine, [the news that
Sweden and Finland are]{.underline} [abandoning]{.underline}
[their]{.underline} long-held [neutrality]{.underline} [in favor of
joining]{.underline} the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
([NATO]{.underline}) [is being met with]{.underline} **[much
exuberance]{.underline}** by the American political elite. President Joe
[Biden]{.underline} [celebrated the move]{.underline} with a joint press
conference at the White House featuring the leaders of both countries.
On the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, Senators Chuck Schumer and
Mitch McConnell --- leaders in two parties that seemingly agree on
almost nothing these days --- jointly sponsored a resolution calling for
expedited NATO accession. 

Much of the Beltway media predictably joined the chorus, with editorials
from newspapers such as the Washington Post heralding the move.  

For America's political establishment, NATO expansion has been one of
the closest things to a foreign policy holy sacrament in the post-Cold
War era. But our policy-making elite are doing the American people a
disservice by rubber-stamping an expansion of America's security
commitments through NATO during a period of economic turmoil at home and
emerging security challenges in other parts of the world.  

It is not in the national interest of the United States, through NATO,
to commit to defend two wealthy European welfare states whose neutrality
has kept them safe and prosperous for more than 70 years. While some
insist Russia's invasion of Ukraine changes everything, the fact remains
that new [security guarantees will force
trade-offs,](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nato-confident-turkey-sweden-finland-admittance) consume
more resources, and increase the likelihood of a confrontation with a
nuclear-armed adversary.  

[Despite rhetoric from NATO evangelists]{.underline} that can often give
the contrary impression, [adding Finland and Sweden to NATO]{.underline}
**[will lead to increased costs]{.underline}** for the U.S.  

[Admitting both nations]{.underline} to NATO [could generate
up-front [**expenses of over \$8
billion**](https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/6307458684112#sp=show-clips)]{.underline}  **[along
with \$1.5 billion in additional annual costs]{.underline}**. And while
U.S. military leaders are currently claiming that their membership in
NATO won't lead to a permanent stationing of troops in either nation,
they do admit that more [U.S. troops will likely rotate to
both]{.underline} [Finland and Sweden on a more frequent
basis]{.underline}. [This will place **further strain on a U.S. military
that**]{.underline} **[is already struggling to sustain deployments in
support of dozens of ongoing operations including active combat missions
in Iraq, Syria, and Somalia.  ]{.underline}**

[One]{.underline} frequently cited [justification]{.underline} [for
admitting]{.underline} [Finland and Sweden]{.underline} to NATO [is that
**they have capable militaries that would enhance NATO.**
However]{.underline}, the [reality is that]{.underline} [both
countries]{.underline} [have **relatively small professional
militaries**]{.underline} [of around 20,000 troops]{.underline} [each
that rely]{.underline} [on large reserve forces]{.underline} [in a time
of war]{.underline} [and which lack long-range force]{.underline}
[projection capabilities.]{.underline} [Sweden **is already
requesting**]{.underline} [a larger U.S. naval presence]{.underline} in
the Baltic Sea, [calling into question the]{.underline} [ability of
their military to secure their own backyard]{.underline}.  

Additionally, **[neither country]{.underline}** currently [**meets** the
**2 percent** of GDP defense spending]{.underline} goal that was agreed
to by NATO members. Just as in other parts of Europe[, a
security]{.underline} [guarantee]{.underline} provided by the United
States could **[encourage free-riding and disincentivize]{.underline}**
**[increased investment in defense capabilities]{.underline}** in favor
of more spending on politically popular social programs.  

But [most dangerously]{.underline}, [adding Finland and
Sweden]{.underline} to NATO **[will increase the risk of a nuclear
confrontation with Russia]{.underline}**. As a result of its failures in
Ukraine, [the threat]{.underline} [posed by Russia's conventional
forces]{.underline} [has been reduced]{.underline}. But Russia still
possesses a large nuclear arsenal that, according to the head of the
Defense Intelligence Agency, they will likely rely on more to secure
their borders --- including the nearly 850-mile one they share with
Finland. [NATO membership for Finland]{.underline} [and Sweden includes
extending the umbrella of]{.underline} [America's nuclear deterrent to
both nations**, thus elevating the risk that any border dispute could
escalate into a nuclear exchange.  **]{.underline}

**[2NC -- AT: Deterrence]{.underline}**

**Western border insecurity independently causes Russian preemptive self
defense -- goes nuclear.**

Alternatively, if air-space war assumes a non-nuclear conflict, then the
concept raises serious doubts of a different nature. [[Russian]{.mark}
state]{.underline} and military [[leaders]{.mark} have regularly
[depicted]{.mark} terrifying [scenarios of]{.mark} large-scale
[conflicts]{.mark} being won through non-nuclear means]{.underline}.
Former deputy defense minister [General Arkady Bakhin, for example, has
described how "leading world powers are staking everything on winning
supremacy in the air and in space]{.underline}, on carrying out massive
air-space operations at the outbreak of hostilities, to conduct strikes
against sites of strategic and vital importance all across the
country."15 [It is difficult to imagine, however, that such a conflict,
in reality, would not quickly escalate to a nuclear
exchange]{.underline}, especially as strategic forces and their C3I
systems were continually attacked by conventional munitions.

Right up until the mid-1980s, the military leadership of the USSR
believed that a major war would likely begin in Europe with the early
use by Warsaw Pact forces of hundreds of tactical nuclear weapons "as
soon as \[they\] received information" that NATO was preparing to launch
a nuclear strike.16 After that, Soviet armies would reach the English
Channel and the Pyrenees in a few weeks, or massive nuclear strikes
would be inflicted by the USSR and the United States on one another, and
the war would be over in a few hours, or at most in a few days, with
catastrophic consequences.17

After the end of the Cold War, the task of elaborating probable major
war scenarios was practically shelved because such a war had become
unthinkable in the new political environment. However, strategic
thinking on the next high-technology global war apparently continued in
secret (and probably not only in Russia). [Now, at a time of renewed
confrontation between Russia and the West, the fruits of that work are
finally seeing the light of]{.underline} day. In all likelihood, [the
authors of the strategy imagine that over a relatively long period of
time]{.underline}---days or weeks---[the West would wage a campaign of
air and missile strikes against Russia without using nuclear weapons.
Russia,]{.underline} in turn, [would defend against such attacks and
carry out retaliatory strikes with long-range conventional
weapons.]{.underline} Notably, in 2016, Russian Defense Minister Sergei
Shoigu stated that "by 2021, it is planned to increase by four times the
combat capabilities of the nation's strategic non-nuclear forces, which
will provide the possibility of fully implementing the tasks of
non-nuclear deterrence."18

In other words, [[the]{.mark} basic [premise is that]{.mark} the
U.S.-led [campaigns against Yugoslavia]{.mark} in 1999 or Iraq in 1990
and 2003]{.underline} (which are often cited by experts in this
context[) [may be implemented against Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}---[but
with different results, thanks to the operations of the Russian
Air-Space Forces,]{.underline} the Strategic Rocket Forces, and the Navy
against the United States and its allies.

The [emphasis on defensive and offensive strategic
non-nuclear]{.underline} arms does not exclude, but---on the
contrary---[implies the limited use of nuclear weapons at some
point]{.underline} of the armed conflict. [Sergei [Sukhanov]{.mark}, one
of [the **most authoritative representatives**]{.mark} [of the defense
industries]{.mark}]{.underline} as the constructor general of the Vympel
Corporation, which is responsible for designing strategic defense
systems, has [[exposed]{.mark} the whole panorama of [Russia's]{.mark}
contemporary [strategic logic]{.mark} on the interactio]{.underline}ns
between offensive and defensive systems and between nuclear and
non-nuclear systems:

> If we cannot exclude the possibility of the large-scale use of
> air-space attacks by the U.S. and other NATO countries (i.e., if we

Judging by the available information, the United States does not
have---and is not expected to have for the foreseeable future---the
technological means or the operational plans to wage non-nuclear
air-space warfare against Russia. However, [[the fact that]{.mark} a
major [war with]{.mark} the United States]{.underline} and [[NATO is
***seen***]{.underline} [in]{.underline} ]{.mark}[contemporary
[Russia]{.mark}n []{.mark}strategic thinking [as a prolonged endeavor
involving an integrated]{.mark} technological and operational [continuum
of nuclear and non-nuclear operation]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark},
defensive and offensive capabilities, and ballistic and aerodynamic
weapons [[creates a breeding ground for]{.mark} entanglement. The result
could be [the rapid escalation]{.mark} of a local non-nuclear conflict
[to]{.mark} a **[global nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
remainder of this chapter discusses how new and emerging military
technologies might contribute to such an escalation.

**Not credible. Permanent extended deterrence [invites Russia
war]{.underline} -- commitments to low value targets are inherently
incredible.**

Ted Galen **Carpenter**, PhD, **'19**, NATO: The Dangerous Dinosaur.
Cato Institute. P 108-110.

U.S. leaders relied on the assumption that the geostrategic assets at
stake were large and important enough that extended deterrence to cover
Western Europe was inherently credible to the Kremlin and would not be
challenged. [The assumption proved valid in the Cold War]{.underline}
context. [Even if the Soviets]{.underline} (and the West Europeans) [may
have wondered from time to time if Washington's professed willingness to
commit]{.underline} national suicide to prevent the Red Army from
conquering Europe [was genuine, **no rational person wanted to test
that** proposition.]{.underline}

In [today]{.underline}'s world, however, [[the]{.mark} inherent
[believability of the U.S. pledge is **weak**]{.mark}er. [A vow to
incur]{.mark} even **[grave risks]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to]{.mark}
prevent a **totalitarian superpower enemy** from dominating such key
international economic and [strategic assets as]{.mark} Britain, France,
[Germany]{.mark}, and Italy [had a reasonable]{.mark} degree of
[credibility.]{.mark}]{.underline} [But]{.mark} [[the notion that the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would honor]{.mark} such [a security
pledge to]{.mark}]{.underline} [prevent]{.mark} a
[conventional]{.underline}, [conservative]{.underline} regional power
like [[post-Soviet Russia from reasserting]{.mark} imperial [control
over]{.mark}]{.underline} one or [more [weak neighboring
states]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[strains credulity to the breaking
point]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [America's risks under Article 5
are]{.underline} at least [as great as they were during the Cold
War]{.underline}, [while the stakes involved]{.underline}---and the
benefits to America of retaining a bloated roster of allies---[are much
less.]{.underline}

[[The **intrinsically weaker credibility**]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
**[extended deterrence]{.underline}**]{.mark} [under these new
circumstances **[cannot be overcome by]{.mark}**]{.underline} pounding
the table or **[[increasing the number and intensity of America's
security pledges]{.underline}]{.mark}** to NATO allies. But NATO
partisans blindly refuse to acknowledge that reality. Former U.S.
ambassador to NATO Ivo H. Daalder, for example, argues that "the biggest
threat today is not a deliberate war, as it was \[in the Cold War\], but
the possibility of miscalculation. One worry is that Russia might not
believe that NATO would actually come to the defense of its most exposed
allies--- which is why strong statements of reassurance and commitment
by all NATO countries, and not least the United States, are so vital."
Daalder even puts the verbal aspect on the same plane as tangible
military deployments. The forward presence of NATO forces is an
important signal of resolve, he states, "but they need to be backed by
words that leave no doubt of the intention to use these forces to defend
allies if they are attacked."41 Daalder misses the crucial point: [a
[potential adversary will more likely judge the credibility
of]{.underline}]{.mark} [a [deterrence]{.mark} pledge [based on the
importance of the tangible interests at stake]{.mark}]{.underline} to
the guarantor power compared to the risks the power incurs. [Simply
repeating assurances that "we really mean it" will not make a possible
challenger believe an implausible guarantee]{.underline}. Washington's
problem today is that [[promising to risk]{.mark} national
[suicide]{.mark}]{.underline} for small allies that have little economic
or strategic importance [[looks like a bluff]{.underline}]{.mark}---one
[[that **Moscow may call** in the midst of a crisis]{.mark}, if Russian
leaders believe their country's vital interests are at
stake]{.underline}. That is why [expanding NATO and adding]{.underline}
an assortment of marginally relevant, [volatile dependents]{.underline}
in Russia's immediate neighborhood [merely weakens the credibility of
Washington's long-standing security guarantee]{.underline} to more
significant alliance partners farther west. Daalder's emphasis on the
need to repeat and emphasize the sanctity of the U.S. pledge to all
European allies suggests just how much he and other NATO defenders worry
that otherwise a Kremlin leader might call that bluff.

[[The]{.mark} greater [disparity between risks and benefits]{.mark}
virtually **[invites a challenge]{.mark}** at some point.]{.underline}
Despite the overwrought propaganda in much of the Western media about
[Putin]{.underline} being the new Hitler, his behavior indicates that he
[is a prudent risk take]{.underline}r[, not a reckless one.]{.underline}
But [**one of [the worst aspects of a permanent]{.mark} military
[alliance is that it is permanent]{.mark}**.]{.underline} We must assume
that unknown Russian leaders a decade or a generation from now will not
be gamblers. [[The]{.mark} questionable [notion that the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [is really willing to risk **thermonuclear war** to
protect minuscule states]{.mark} in Russia's neighborhood]{.underline}
or on Russia's border itself [[must be
reconsidered]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is an extremely imprudent
assumption and a high-stakes bet on Washington's part.

Moreover, the willingness of current U.S. leaders to placate NATO's East
European members by stationing American troops and warplanes and
establishing permanent bases on their soil increases the likelihood of a
future tragedy. The goal of European governments, now as during the Cold
War, is to deny U.S. policymakers the element of choice about America
becoming embroiled in any conflict that breaks out. U.S. forces there
serve as tripwires to guarantee that Washington must honor the Article 5
pledge, even if doing so is self-destructive folly. The underlying
perverse logic of insisting on U.S. tripwire forces is that the Kremlin,
believing that the United States will have no choice but to intervene on
behalf of an ally if American troops are among the initial casualties in
a conflict, will never take the fateful first step of attacking a NATO
member, even a small, vulnerable one. By collaborating in this denial of
policy choice, American officials are engaging in the geostrategic
equivalent of making a huge wager on one turn of the roulette
wheel---except in this case, the lives of millions of Americans are at
stake, rather than mere dollars. It is a foolish and irresponsible bet.

Secretary of State Henry Kissinger reportedly once observed that [great
powers do not commit suicide on behalf of allies.]{.underline} But he
should have said that [great powers do not willingly commit suicide on
behalf of allie]{.underline}s. [As]{.underline} the cataclysmic descent
into war by Europe's rival blocs in [1914 demonstrated, great powers
sometimes do end up]{.underline}, however inadvertently, [committing
suicide on behalf of allies. Washington must adopt important policy
changes to make certain that America does not stumble into a similar
tragedy]{.underline} in the 21st century.

**The plan allows the US to [return if necessary]{.underline}.**

Great wailing and despair from the NATO preservation crowd on both sides
of the Atlantic will inevitably accompany any meaningful policy shift.
But 75 years is an exceedingly long period for any policy to be relevant
and beneficial (much less optimal), and America's NATO membership is no
exception. Indeed, it seems to epitomize the problem of policy entropy.
A U.S.-led NATO is now well beyond its appropriate expiration date. It
is time to accord the alliance the retirement celebration that should
have been held when the Cold War came to an end and the Soviet Union
dissolved. [[Moving to a new]{.mark}, more [restrained posture **does
not mean**]{.mark} that [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will take
no interest in Europe]{.mark}'s affairs. We need to [reject the]{.mark}
simplistic "[light switch model]{.mark}"]{.underline} of America's
engagement in the world, [[with only]{.mark} two possible settings:
"[off or on]{.mark}."]{.underline}13 [[There are many settings
betwee]{.mark}n those two extremes,]{.underline} and [there are multiple
forms of engagement]{.underline}--- [diplomatic, economic, and cultural,
as well as security.]{.underline}

[Every effort should be made to preserve a robust]{.underline}, mutually
beneficial transatlantic economic [relationship. The United States also
can]{.underline} and should [maintain extensive diplomatic and cultural
connections]{.underline} with Europe. And Washington should establish a
consultative body either with a new European security organization or
with the Continent's main military powers to address issues of mutual
concern. Beyond that aspect, [[there is nothing to prevent joint
military exercises and]{.mark} even temporary [deployments of]{.mark}
U.S. [air and naval]{.mark}]{.underline} [[units, if the security
environment turns]{.mark} more [threatening]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The
point is just]{.underline}]{.mark} [that [America should not]{.mark}
seek to [be Europe's **permanent** security blanket]{.mark} and
hegemon]{.underline}.

[This more **flexible approach**]{.underline} would constitute an
updated version of Robert A. Taft's policy of the free hand. Moreover,
[it would be one component of a U.S. global grand strategy based on
realism and restraint]{.underline}.14 [America would no longer shackle
itself to commitments that have more drawbacks than benefits or those
that lock the republic into obligations that no longer make
sense]{.underline}. It would end the thankless, unproductive strategy of
trying to micromanage the security affairs of both Europe and the
neighboring Middle East. [For U.S. leaders to seek to deny their own
country the essential element of policy choice is perverse]{.underline}.
Indeed, [a sustainable transatlantic policy for the 21st century must
rest firmly on the principle of **maximum choice**]{.underline} for the
United States.

Even if this were true---as it may be---[the [time has come to
**reassess** whether the U.S. needs]{.mark} to **stay in [an outdated
alliance]{.mark}** that was designed to deter the Soviet Union from
an]{.underline} attack on Western Europe during the Cold War, which
ended more than a quarter century ago. In fact, once the Soviet Union
fell in 1991, the United States should have turned NATO over to the
by-then rich Europeans to deter a much-diminished Russia. It was no
longer 1949, when the Soviets still had a massive tank army in central
Europe, and most of Western Europe was in rubble from World War II.
[Despite today's hype of a resurgent Russian threat, Russia still has a
GDP roughly equivalent to Spain. In contrast, the Europeans combined
have a GDP **greater** than the United States.]{.underline} However,
Trump is correct that the wealthy [**[Europeans are free
riders]{.mark}** on massive and excessive U.S. defense
spending.]{.underline} For example, the mighty German economy only
spends one percent of GDP on defense. And despite establishment analysts
perennially noting that the only time NATO's Article V mutual defense
clause has been invoked was after the Cold War ended in response to the
9/11 attacks against the United States, European efforts in Afghanistan
have been mostly window dressing, and in any major war, the United
States would be defending Europe and not vice versa. For most of
American history, the country followed the prescription of George
Washington and Thomas Jefferson to avoid "permanent" and "entangling"
alliances, respectively. Only after World War II did the United States
go wild in policing the world via Pax Americana, with NATO being one of
the first permanent alliances established, which has now turned into an
entangling end in itself. Washington and Jefferson realized that the
United States had geographical advantages that other countries could
only dream about---two huge ocean moats separating it from the world's
usual zones of conflict---and thus had the luxury of using only
temporary alliances to enhance its security. In contrast, historically,
Russia has had very poor intrinsic security; because of bad geography
and topography on its western flank, it has been invaded many
times---by, for example, Poland, Sweden, France, and Germany---the last
of which resulted in 25 million dead Russians at the hands of Adolf
Hitler. Two primary reasons exist for the failure of post-Cold War
democracy in Russia and the rise of the now autocratic Putin: 1) given
Russia's precarious security situation, it may be impossible for a
stable democracy to take root there; and 2) [the **eastward expansion to
Russia's borders** of NATO, an [alliance **hostile** to Russia]{.mark}
(think about what the U.S. reaction would be to Russia forming an
alliance with Mexico), after promising Russia that it would not happen,
[**contributed** to]{.mark} the historically aware [country's
**attraction** to an]{.mark} ex-KGB [authoritarian ruler.]{.mark} Putin
is certainly no gem]{.underline}, meddling in the U.S. election,
stealing Crimea from Ukraine by armed force, and surreptitiously
invading eastern Ukraine; [but [Ukraine is **very important** within
Russia's]{.mark} security [buffer]{.mark}. Although]{.underline}
Presidents Barack Obama and [Trump]{.underline} both [should have taken
stiffer action in response to Putin's election meddling]{.underline} to
deter future interference, [that has **little** to do with whether the
United States still needs to **formally pledge to defend** affluent
European nations]{.underline} against a second-rate conventional power,
such as Russia. Even in the nuclear weapons area, in which Russia is
still a superpower, the British and French nuclear forces provide a
deterrent against a conventional or nuclear attack by Russia on Europe.
In a post-Cold War world---with the rise of China and \$150 trillion in
unfunded American liabilities (Social Security, Medicare, and federal
and state pensions), including a \$22 trillion U.S. national debt---[the
Europeans need to take over the burden of their own defense so that the
U.S. can focus on more important things]{.underline}, such as its own
prosperity and thus security. [This [change would entail the **U.S.
withdrawing from NATO**]{.mark} but [potentially acting as an **informal
balancer of last resort**]{.mark} only in the unlikely
event]{.underline}, given the aforementioned wealth disparity, that the
balance of power between Russia and Western Europe got out of whack.
Despite the histrionics from establishment pundits and even President
Trump's potentially suspect motives, [the best U.S. policy is to
**[withdraw from NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}, even if it helps the
nefarious Putin in the short term. In the long term, [the move will
**[enhance]{.mark} both [U.S. and European security]{.mark}** by making
American policy more independent and the Europeans more
**self-reliant.**]{.underline}

We are witnessing in real time how statements and veiled threats of
nuclear use -- "fire and fury such as the world has never seen" (Baker
and Choe 2017) -- can have lasting consequences. Statements by President
Trump suggesting a willingness to use nuclear weapons first in a crisis
with North Korea has exacerbated the risks of accidental nuclear
escalation. But in even calmer times, such vague threats are ill
advised. For example, US officials apparently believe that [[repeatedly
stating]{.mark} or demonstrating [America's willingness]{.mark} and
ability [to use nuc]{.mark}lear wea]{.underline}pon[s]{.mark} in
response to many kinds of nonnuclear threats can be reassuring. Japan
might imagine that references to nuclear weapons use, such as an
American president [announcing that "all options are on the
table]{.underline}" in response to nonnuclear options might deter China
or North Korea from initiating a conventional attack and make war less
likely. But China and North Korea are well aware that the US has nuclear
weapons; there is no need to make explicit threats. Anything that would
be interpreted by them -- or by Japan -- as a direct commitment to make
a nuclear threat in response to anything but the use of nuclear weapons
create what [[has been called "a **commitment
tra**]{.mark}**p**"]{.underline} (Sagan, 2000). In these cases, the
United States and Japan may feel compelled to follow through with a
nuclear response, even if they believe it was unwise and might trigger a
catastrophic an otherwise avoidable response. If we are fighting and
likely to prevail in a conventional war on the Korean peninsula, using
nuclear weapons could lead to a move devastating nuclear attack by the
North on South Korea and stalemate any conventional conflict. Yet,
[[failing to]{.mark} [respond could **expose**]{.mark} **past
[commitments]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to use nuclear weapons [as a

[Paper tiger?]{.underline} No, [more **cardboard

power to hurt as bargaining and best held in reserve. [NATO has become a
collective deterrent rather than a collective defender]{.underline}. [On

deterrence, Washington would put together a high-end coalition under its

Although the risk of [[**nuclear war** between the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} may not appear to be as much of a threat as
it was during the Cold War, it [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} still a
**[[looming]{.underline}]{.mark}** possibility. As a matter of doctrine,
[Russia]{.underline} has [articulated]{.underline} its [**willingness**
to **use nuclear weapons** in response to anything it deems]{.underline}
to be [an existential threat]{.underline}, stating,

> The Russian Federation shall reserve for itself the right to employ
> nuclear weapons in response to the use against it and/or its allies of
> nuclear and other kinds of weapons of mass destruction, as well as in
> the case of aggression against the Russian Federation with use of
> conventional weapons when the state's very existence has been
> threatened.86

Against the backdrop of Russia's violations of the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces Treaty and the U.S. announcement that it would walk away
from that treaty, as well as the earlier U.S. 2002 withdrawal from the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, [Russia's [**strategic enhancements**
to]{.mark} its [nuclear forces]{.mark}]{.underline}---including changes
to its intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched
ballistic missiles---[appear **[particularly
problematic]{.mark}**]{.underline}.87

In this context, [any changes or perceived changes in]{.underline} U.S.
and NATO **[nuclear forces]{.underline}**---such as the recent placement
of missile defense systems in Eastern Europe and discussion of
increasing nuclear force posture---[serve to **further jeopardize
strategic stability** with Russia]{.underline}.88 [Putin]{.underline}
has [expressed]{.underline} a great deal of [concern about]{.underline}
U.S. [nuclear force developments, which he sees as being targeted at
Russia]{.underline} despite U.S. assertions that the focus of its
nuclear deterrence is on threats from Iran and North Korea.89 Thus far,
[nuclear deterrence has largely rested on the [strategic stability
enabled by]{.mark} the **[relative parity]{.mark}** between U.S. and
Russian nuclear forces. Any [shifts]{.mark} in this balance, coupled
with the Russian belief that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [intends to launch a nuclear attack, may [spark
Russian fears]{.mark} that [it will **lose**]{.mark} its
**[second-strike]{.mark}** capability, [increasing]{.mark} its
[incentive to **strike first**]{.mark}]{.underline}.90 In a classic
security dilemma scenario, [U.S. and NATO [attempts to
**strengthen**]{.mark} their **[defensive
capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, particularly in the nuclear realm,
[may **[inadvertently appear]{.mark}** to be
**[offensive]{.mark}**---and therefore threatening---behavior and
[trigger]{.mark} the outbreak of [**conventional** or]{.mark} even
**[nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.91 [Given Russia's]{.underline}
expressed [willingness to use nuclear weapons and Putin's tendency to
interpret any]{.underline} U.S. [nuclear force developments as
offensive, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[should]{.underline} be careful to [avoid **inadvertently provoking a
nuclear response** from Russia while attempting to deter this exact
behavior. Risks of **[Russian nuclear escalation]{.mark}** might also be
[prompted by]{.mark} major [changes in]{.mark} the [balance of
**conventional forces**]{.mark}]{.underline}. From this perspective,
[the ultimate risk associated with [enhancing **any form** of]{.mark}
U.S. or NATO **[military capabilities]{.mark}** is that Russia may feel
that it has to respond with a **nuclear attack** if it is unable to
**match** U.S. and NATO combined conventional military
strength]{.underline}. Therefore, [enhancing and expanding capabilities,
**even if** they are defensive in nature, may create such a **strong
perception of threat** for Russia that it could prompt a **preemptive
nuclear attack**]{.underline}.92

**Extended deterrence generates a commitment trap -- no capabilities can
surmount interest asymmetries.**

**Shifrinson**, Joshua, Prof of IR @ BU, **'17**, "Time to Consolidate
NATO?" *The Washington Quarterly,* Vol. 40, Issue 1.

The [credibility]{.underline} of the U.S. commitment to its NATO allies
[has long been unclear.]{.underline} At root, **[[credibility]{.mark}
[hinges on the perception]{.mark} in the minds [of foreign
decisionmakers that a state has sufficient
interest]{.mark}]{.underline}** in a given issue that it is willing to
pay a certain---potentially large---cost to obtain or secure that
objective. Owing to the exorbitant prospective costs of a U.S.--Soviet
nuclear exchange during the Cold War, regular transatlantic crises
revolved around the question of whether the United States would trade
"Boston for Bonn" in the event of a general European war.8 So long as
the United States retained sole control of NATO's decision to escalate
past the nuclear threshold, U.S. policymakers faced a real problem in
making Soviet policymakers and American allies alike believe that they
would willingly take the nuclear plunge if events dictated.9 As Thomas
Schelling noted long ago, [[it is inherently difficult to
convince]{.mark} other [actors]{.mark} that [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [will commit suicide]{.mark} [for other
states]{.mark}]{.underline}.10

Still, [this problem was at least plausibly manageable]{.underline}
[[during the Cold War]{.underline}]{.mark}.11 Despite the prospective
costs, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [retained a large and
pervasive interest in]{.mark} keeping [Western Europe's]{.mark} economic
and military potential]{.underline} [beyond Soviet control]{.underline}.
These objectives, in fact, heavily shaped the United States' Cold War
commitment to European security as the United States moved (1) to defend
Western Europe from potential Soviet machinations, and (2) to deter
Soviet adventurism against the area in the first place.12 [The
alternative was clear: if the Soviet Union were to dominate Europe's
war-making strength, it might tip the balance of power]{.underline}
against the United States, requiring a potentially ruinous
counter-mobilization and global competition that an isolated United
States might be unable to win. Geography reinforced this imperative, as
failure to deter or defend against a Soviet assault across the
inner-German border meant the USSR could quickly overrun the region.
[The result was a concerted effort by the United States to make its
promise to defend its NATO allies as credible]{.underline} as possible
by forward-deploying large military force and seeking ways to escalate a
contest with the USSR should it prove necessary.13

[[Today, the situation is reversed]{.underline}.]{.mark} The grand
bargain in which Washington kept its finger alone on the nuclear button
remains intact; [if [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates is to fully
honor its treaty commitments, it [must]{.mark} ultimately be willing to
[engage in a nuclear exchange with Russia for]{.mark} the sake of [its
allies.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, [[where the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [could plausibly claim to trade Boston for Bonn]{.mark}
prior to 1991, **[no amount of reassurance can make the promise to trade
Toledo for Tallinn credible]{.mark}**]{.underline} today---[the stakes
of the game are too low.]{.underline}

Alliances function when states decide that their mutual preservation
adds to each side's national security and can be attained at a cost
proportional to the benefit. For better or worse, NATO's post-Cold War
enlargement altered this equation by notionally committing the United
States to defend a host of states in Eastern Europe of questionable
relevance to U.S. security. Indeed, those [states most immediately
threatened by Russia]{.underline}---[[Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania]{.mark},]{.underline} followed by Poland---[[are]{.mark} among
the **[least important allies]{.mark}**]{.underline} in crude
geopolitical terms. [The [three Baltic states]{.mark} combined
[accounted for]{.mark} only [0.13 percent of]{.mark} total NATO [defense
expenditures]{.mark}]{.underline} and 0.26 percent of NATO members' GDP
as of 2016; Poland represented 1.17 and 1.54 percent, respectively.14
American exchange with these states is similarly limited: trade with the
Baltic states as a whole came to less than \$3 billion in 2015 against
over \$3.75 trillion in total U.S. trade.15 Baldly stated, [these
[states could disappear without compromising]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates' [economic security or]{.mark} NATO's [military
viability]{.mark}. The [questionable value]{.mark} of these
states]{.underline} alone thus [[renders the U.S. commitment]{.mark} to
their defense **[highly contestable]{.mark}**]{.underline}.16 The
American public, meanwhile, seems to recognize this very dynamic at some
basic level, with 37 percent of U.S. citizens in a 2015 Pew Global
Attitudes survey expressing reluctance with aiding a NATO ally
threatened by Russia.17

[[Political geography]{.underline}]{.mark} further [[compounds NATO's
problems. Not only can countries]{.mark} threatened by Russia [be lost
without compromising NATO's ability to defend the rest]{.mark} of
Europe[, but even an]{.mark} [expanded Russia would be poorly placed to
dominate]{.mark} the continent]{.underline}. Belarus and Ukraine, after
all, lie across any Russian advance into Central Europe, while [simply
retaining control of a unified Germany affords NATO a
defense-in-depth]{.underline} it never enjoyed during the Cold War. Add
in the reality that [Russia is an economic, political, and military
pygmy]{.underline} compared to the Soviet Union everywhere except in the
nuclear realm, and the United States' intrinsic interest in those states
most immediately threatened by Russia is substantially less than during
the Cold War.18 Simply put, unlike the situation vis-à-vis the Soviet
Union, [Russian dominance over the Baltic state]{.underline}s, Poland,
and other new(er) NATO members [would not result in the United States'
eviction from Europe]{.underline} and concomitant loss of the region's
economic or military strength.

Military pressures reinforce these dilemmas. Whereas a conventional
defense of Western Europe was at least a possibility prior to
1989--1991, distance, reinforcement rates, and force-to-space ratios
mean a [conventional defense in Eastern Europe is **not a realistic
option**]{.underline} today.19 [War games by the Rand Corporation
highlight the problem in the Baltics context]{.underline}. To be sure,
forces stationed in Eastern Europe can serve as a tripwire to deter
Russian aggression by seemingly promising to bring NATO members'
collective strength to bear.20 [If deterrence]{.underline} fails,
however, and [short of committing nearly all of NATO's conventional
ground and air power to the theater, even heavily-armored NATO forces
can **only slow down a Russian assault**]{.underline} and promise a
lengthy East--West conflict. Yet here, NATO again faces real limits to
fighting in and around NATO's East European members.21 [Though the
United States can threaten conventional escalation, it **cannot credibly
commit** to fighting for states of low strategic value if doing so risks
a strategic nuclear exchange.]{.underline}

Nevertheless, the United States would undoubtedly face calls for
precisely such steps that might lead to nuclear escalation in any losing
conventional fight. Moreover, since any sustained effort to defend or
retake the Baltics requires NATO conventional operations close to the
Russian homeland, it risks attacks (accidental or otherwise) on Russian
territory that invite an escalatory response. Russian antiaccess and
area-denial (A2/AD) assets used against reinforcements flowing into the
region---to say nothing of direct attacks on Poland---may also result in
strikes on Russian-owned Kaliningrad, generating a similar escalation
problem. In short, [[NATO]{.mark} cannot readily defend its Eastern
flank through conventional means, faces implausibly large strategic
risks if it tries, and so [confronts an **insoluble credibility
crisis**]{.mark}]{.underline}.22 Indeed, [that Estonia is now preparing
to wage a lengthy guerilla war]{.underline} against a prospective
Russian occupying force, [while Lithuania is slowly moving to reinstate
a military draft suggests **vulnerable states recognize the United
States' credibility dilemma**]{.underline} [and are **hedging their
security bets** as best they can]{.underline}.23

If anything, the main function of NATO deployments has been to
antagonize a Russia that has far more at stake in Eastern Europe for
geographic and historical reasons than the United States.24 To be clear,
NATO expansion in and of itself did not cause East--West relations to
deteriorate.25 However, U.S.-backed efforts to expand NATO eastward and
subsequently deploy military forces to the region have been met with
Russian pushback---Russian overflights of NATO airspace, diplomatic
obfuscation, and military deployments have all accelerated in recent
years.26 Assuming NATO efforts in Eastern Europe continue, Russian
leaders are prone to respond with further bellicosity that generates
further strains in NATO--Russian relations.27 Paradoxically, the
resulting insecurity spiral increases the likelihood that efforts to
deter Russia will result in deterrence failure.28 Combined with the
possibility that a NATO--Russia crisis may see Russia escalate the
confrontation in order to de-escalate the situation, the risk of
miscalculation is clear.29 Collectively, this situation simultaneously
invites Russian actions designed to discredit the United States in the
eyes of its allies, gives threatened allies incentives to force events
with Russia to tie American hands and deepen the United States'
involvement, and increases the risk of an action-reaction cycle.30

[The net result is a dangerous standoff.]{.underline} To deter
aggression, NATO relies on a collective security promise ultimately
capped by the pledge that the United States will risk its own survival
by putting its nuclear forces to use on behalf of its allies.
[[For]{.mark} the Baltic states, Poland, and]{.underline}--- potentially
in the future---NATO's other [[**post Cold War additions**, this pledge
is **no longer realistic**]{.mark} on strategic or military grounds. The
steps the United States and its allies are taking to reassure the most
vulnerable members of NATO,]{.underline} however, [increase the odds of
a NATO-- Russia crisis]{.underline}. Yet [[if]{.underline}]{.mark} and
when a [crisis erupts]{.underline}, the clarifying effect of a
prospective nuclear exchange is apt to cause **[[cooler
heads]{.underline}]{.mark}** to [[**prevail** and]{.mark}]{.underline}
encourage U.S. efforts [[to restrain]{.mark} the dogs of
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[revealing]{.underline}]{.mark} that
American [[security guarantees]{.underline}]{.mark} to Eastern Europe
**[[were not credible in the first place]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The
more [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates continues [pretending]{.mark}
that [its commitment]{.mark} to all NATO members [is
created]{.mark}]{.underline} [[equal]{.mark}, the more it risks creating
a situation that [will reveal the shibboleth of the U.S.
commitment]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**The Baltics are logistically indefensible -- NATO faces a choice of
embarrassing defeat or nuclear escalation.**

However, [[in the Baltic]{.mark} region, [Russia enjo]{.mark}ys
significant [advantages]{.mark} of time and]{.underline}
[space]{.underline}, and also of [force ratios and]{.underline} in key
capabilities such as [air defence]{.underline}.32 [[These advantages
might]{.underline}]{.mark}, if Moscow believed the costs and
consequences to be manageable, [[**tempt it** towards]{.mark} military
**[adventurism]{.mark}**]{.underline}; indeed [[the Russian]{.mark}
armed [forces]{.mark} reportedly [rehearsed an attack on NATO]{.mark}
countries [in]{.mark} their most recent western direction]{.underline}
strategic exercise, **[[Zapad]{.mark} 2017]{.underline}**. 33 It is only
prudent to seek to deter such an eventuality, and to plan to ensure that
it could not succeed.

[A commonly discussed scenario in the Baltic context is
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} so-called **[[fait
accompli]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in which [[Russia would]{.mark} use
forces in the Western MD to [mount a **rapid, surprise attack**]{.mark}
to seize]{.underline} some or all [Baltic territory,]{.underline}
[[confronting NATO with]{.underline}]{.mark} a series of [unpalatable
choices]{.underline}, such as: a humiliating -- and probably for the
Alliance, [fatal]{.underline} -- [acceptance of the new
facts]{.underline} on the ground; [[bloody]{.underline}]{.mark} and
costly [conventional [operations]{.mark}]{.underline} to restore the
Alliance's territorial integrity; [or [nuclear
escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}. In such a scenario, [Russia would
expect to increase its chances of success through]{.underline} three
interrelated actions. First, it would conduct operations employing, as a
coordinated whole, military means supported by non-military means (e.g.
**[[disinformation and cyber-attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}**) -- this
approach is at [the heart of General Gerasimov's 'strategy of [active
defence']{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} sometimes [known in the West as
'hybrid' warfare.]{.underline}34 Second, [it [would]{.mark}]{.underline}
likely [[contest]{.mark} the freedom of [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}
forces [to [move into]{.mark}]{.underline} and within [the
[conflict]{.mark} zone [using]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example
[cyber-attacks or [precision]{.mark} longrange
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Russia's ability to successfully execute
a denial strateg]{.underline}y with kinetic means, known to the West as
Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD), may be a subject of some debate amongst
analysts, but its deployment of a substantial number of long-range
weapons systems [in and beyond the Western MD, could still be expected
to at least complicate NATO's decision-making regarding
reinforcement]{.underline} and at worst paralyse it.35 [Third, [it
may]{.mark}]{.underline} use, or [[threaten]{.mark} to use [nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} in an attempt [to]{.underline} further
[disrupt NATO's decision-making]{.underline}.36 In this regard,
[Russia's deployment of the dual-capable ground-launched [cruise
missile]{.mark}]{.underline}, 9M729/SSC-8, [is a particular
concern]{.underline}. These [weapons [would allow Russia to]{.mark}
[intimidate Europe]{.mark}an Allies and partners [without
threatening]{.mark} t]{.underline}he US with its [intercontinental
nuclear capability]{.underline}, greatly [[raising the]{.mark} potential
[cost of]{.mark} a [counterattack]{.mark}]{.underline} and perhaps
fracturing Alliance cohesion.37

In this fait accompli scenario, [Russia would move large numbers of
forces rapidly into the Baltic states.]{.underline} The RAND
corporation's wellknown series of table top exercises, for example,
assumed that 27 Russian manoeuvre battalions from the Western MD and
Kaliningrad exclave would be available to carry out such an attack on
either Estonia or Latvia.38 Once the limited Baltic and NATO defence had
been overcome, these forces would presumably be supplemented or replaced
by follow-on-forces from the Western and other MDs. For restoration of
territory operations, [NATO would need to deploy comparably large forces
to the Baltic region]{.underline}. In order to provide a more concrete
basis for our consideration of this scenario and our discussions with
experts, we assumed that the following forces would need to be moved
to/towards the Baltic region:

• The NRF including the VJTF. The VJTF land component includes around 5
000 troops, while the NRF is up to 40 000 strong.39

• A US Corps, comprising at least three mechanised or armoured
divisions, perhaps 80 000 -100 000 troops.

• One German, one French, one UK mechanised or armoured division,
perhaps 60 000 to 75 000 troops in total.40

Without exception, [our interviewees agreed that [troop movements at
large scale would prov]{.mark}e very [challenging]{.mark}]{.underline}
for the Alliance. In part, this is because [NATO is no longer accustomed
to moving large numbers of military personnel]{.underline} and equipment
and needs to relearn skills that were lost after the end of the Cold
War. Even so, the complexity of this task should not be underestimated.
Military movement specialists contend that [[rapidly moving even a
brigade is a concern.]{.mark} Moving a divisi]{.underline}on, as in
exercise Defender-Europe 20 (described by one interviewee as "changing
the paradigm") [is expected to throw up a range of problems that have
not even been foreseen]{.underline} during the decades of decline in
NATO large-scale collective defence thinking.

[In the Baltic region, this problem is compounded by the lack of
infrastructure]{.underline} to support large-scale movement -- for
example, depots, vehicle parks, fuelling facilities --
[and]{.underline}, more fundamentally, by the simple [lack of
geographical space]{.underline}. The shortage of space is more acute in
some areas than in others. [[The Suwałki corridor]{.underline}]{.mark}
-- a 65km-wide piece of land along the border between Lithuania and
Poland between the Kaliningrad exclave and Belarus -- [[is a notable
bottleneck]{.underline}]{.mark}. The corridor, which is [[the only land
connection]{.mark} between the three Baltic states and the rest of NATO
territory, [is]{.mark} served by **[just two
road]{.mark}s**]{.underline} (one with a restricted 7.5 tonne capacity)
and a single railway line.

As a further complication, [[military movements]{.mark} during times of
crisis,]{.underline} in particular on the roads, [[are likely to be
impeded]{.mark} by the movement in the opposite direction of large
numbers of refugees]{.underline} and displaced persons. Finally, though
it is beyond the scope of our report, any deployed armed forces must
also be sustained. [Provision of fuel, water, food, accommodation and so
forth massively complicate the logistic]{.underline}s challenges of
largescale deployments and place substantial pressure on Host Nation
Support (HNS) organisations, whose aim is to relieve deploying forces of
these burdens in order that the ratio of combat forces to support forces
can be kept as high as possible. During Trident Juncture 2018, for
example, the Norwegian Armed Forces provided 35 000 beds, served 1.8
million meals and 4.6 million bottles of water, did 660 tonnes of
laundry, and established 50 camps. To achieve this and other sustainment
tasks, they concluded contracts worth around EUR €159 million with
Norwegian companies.41 According to our interviewees, a key lesson from
Trident Juncture is that the HNS requirements were substantially larger
than anticipated, and at some points, exhausted the capacity of the
supporting troops.

Russian President Vladimir [[Putin annexed Crimea]{.underline}]{.mark}
from Ukraine [[and meddled in]{.mark} the 2016]{.underline} US
[[elections]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[These]{.underline}]{.mark} recent
[[actions]{.underline}]{.mark} [[by China and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} appear to [[have a common]{.mark}
denominator]{.underline}---**[the [desire to assert]{.mark} their
[status as]{.mark} global [great power]{.mark}s]{.underline}** (Larson
and Shevchenko 2019, 198, 202--3). Could [US accommodation]{.underline}
of Chinese or Russian status ambitions help **[channel their behavior in
a more constructive direction]{.underline}**?

The rationale for status accommodation is that [attempts by established
powers to obstruct]{.underline} [the rise of a state]{.underline} such
as China are apt to [provoke]{.underline} a [backlash in the form of
heightened nationalism, military buildups, or geopolitical rivalry.
[This is rooted in]{.mark}]{.underline} the psychological insights of
[social identity theory]{.underline} (SIT), [which argues
that]{.underline} impermeable [status barriers]{.underline}, combined
with the perception of unfair treatment and the possibility of change in
the status hierarchy, will **[motivate [a lower-status group to
challenge the status quo]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Tajfel 1978a, 1978b;
Tajfel and Turner 1979). Steven Ward (2017) argues that the case for
status accommodation rests on shaky scholarly ground. Ward contends that
scholars who draw this connection (Larson and Shevchenko 2010, 2014b,
2019) have misused the psychological theory and presents an alternative
explanation of status competition in international relations (IR), which
he claims is more consistent with SIT. In Ward's version of SIT,
impermeable elite group boundaries only affect individuals who try to
leave their group for a higher-status one; impermeability does not
influence the behavior of groups. Thus, instead of being motivated by
anger or hostility at persistent status denial, states pursue
geopolitical competition because they have the capability to do so and
the international community values advanced weaponry and overseas
possessions as indicators of status.

To refute the argument that persistent status denial leads to conflict,
Ward discusses "most likely" cases for the IR version of SIT---Germany's
Weltpolitik before World War I and Japanese foreign policy in the
interwar period. In neither case, he asserts, was geopolitical
competition driven by reactions to status barriers thrown up by the
established powers.

Ward's narrow critique misses the meaning and real-world implications of
SIT. Most crucially, he overlooks the psychological dynamics of why
lower-status groups choose to challenge the status quo---their
frustration and anger over being denied the chance for status
advancement, their unfair treatment by society, and the illegitimacy of
the status hierarchy. In what follows, we will first present the basic
propositions of SIT. We will then highlight several of Ward's principal
misconceptions, errors that could mislead researchers and have
disastrous policy implications.

Social Identity Theory Propositions

SIT was developed in the 1970s by Henri Tajfel and his colleagues at the
University of Bristol in the United Kingdom to correct for the
reductionism of US social psychology, which attributed such intergroup
phenomena as prejudice to the characteristics of individuals (Hogg and
Abrams 1988, 12-- 13). One insight of SIT is that individuals have both
a personal identity and a social identity, derived from the social
groups to which they belong (Tajfel 1978a, 41--43).

Because a person's social group membership constitutes part of the self,
[[members want their group to have a "**positively distinctive"
identity**. Unfavorable comparisons]{.underline}]{.mark} with a similar
reference group **[[threaten collective
self-esteem]{.underline}]{.mark}** and may lead to the adoption of an
identity management strategy. The choice of strategy depends on beliefs
about the permeability of group boundaries and the legitimacy and
stability of the status hierarchy (Tajfel and Turner 1979, 40). If
lower-status group members believe that boundaries between social groups
are permeable, they may try to "pass" into a higher-status group (Tajfel
and Turner 1979, 43)--- a mobility strategy. Although Ward insists that
mobility is limited to individuals, in his original theoretical
statement, Tajfel (1978a, 94) refers to the lower-status group strategy
of becoming "more like the superior group," with the aim of "cultural,
social, and psychological assimilation of the group as a whole." In
order for this to take place, there would have to be a "breaking down of
the barriers preventing the group from obtaining improved access." In
their analysis of identity management strategies, Blanz et al. (1998,
700) report that there is "no consensus among social identity theorists
on the conceptualization of assimilation as either an individual or a
collective strategy."1

In international politics, when states perceive that elite group
boundaries are permeable, states seek social mobility through emulation
of the values, practices, and norms of the higher-status states in order
to be admitted to elite clubs (Larson and Shevchenko 2010, 71--73;
2014a, 38--40; 2014b, 271) or a more prestigious social category such as
middle power (Gilady 2018, 113--18).

When the status hierarchy is perceived as secure, that is, legitimate
and stable, the lower-status group cannot even conceive of any
alternatives to the status quo (Tajfel 1978a, 87). Under these
conditions, the lower-status group may reduce unpleasant feelings of
inferiority by engaging in social creativity, that is, reinterpreting
their situation. A social creativity strategy may (1) identify a new
dimension on which the in-group is superior, (2) reevaluate an existing
characteristic as positive, or (3) choose an even lower-status group as
the target of comparison (Tajfel and Turner 1979, 43). In international
relations, social creativity frequently entails reframing a negative
characteristic as positive or finding a new dimension on which the state
is superior (Larson and Shevchenko 2010, 73). For example, the Chinese
Communist Party now celebrates Confucianism as an element of Chinese
culture, although Mao Zedong condemned the philosophy as feudalistic.
But when the lower-status group begins to regard its position as
illegitimate and the status hierarchy as changeable, it may adopt a
strategy of social competition (Tajfel and Turner 1979, 45--46). Social
competition seeks to "reverse the relative positions of the in-group and
out-group on salient dimensions" (Tajfel and Turner 1979, 44). To
achieve this goal, [social competition "aims to equal or outdo the
dominant group in the area on which its claim to superior status
rests"]{.underline} (Larson and Shevchenko 2010, 72). Ward (2017, 826)
mistakenly claims that the Larson and Shevchenko application of SIT
restricts social competition to military and economic competition, but
it can assume various forms. For example, during the Cold War, the
Soviet Union sought to "catch up and surpass" the United States in
economic production, modernization, culture, and standards of living, as
well as military power (Larson and Shevchenko 2014a, 39; 2019).

Misconceptions about SIT

Ward's (2017, 822--23) reason for contending that impermeable group
boundaries do not play any role in SIT is that only individuals have the
unpleasant experience of being denied the opportunity to join a
higher-status group. However, according to SIT, impermeable boundaries
cause individuals to identify more strongly with their in-group and to
act as group members (Tajfel and Turner 1979, 35; Ellemers 1993;
Bettencourt et al. 2001). Ward's account also downplays the importance
of the legitimacy of the status hierarchy, which is central to SIT.
[Impermeable group boundaries combined with the perceptions of the
illegitimacy of the status hierarchy and the possibility of change can
**turbocharge** social **competition**]{.underline} (Turner and Brown
1978; Ellemers 1993; Bettencourt et al. 2001). [[Lower-status groups
will **"lash out"**]{.mark} **[at the illegitimacy of their
status]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Hornsey 2008, 214; Tajfel and Turner
1979, 45-- 46). As Tajfel (1978b, 52) observes, "a combination of
illegitimacy and instability would become a powerful incitement for
attempts to change the status quo." [The role of illegitimacy in
encouraging challenges to the higher-status group distinguishes SIT from
alternative explanations.]{.underline} For example,
[Wohlforth]{.underline} (2009) [argues that uncertainty about which
state will prevail due to uneven distribution of power **increases the
likelihood of status competition**.]{.underline} Renshon (2017, 57--58)
argues that [[states that receive less status]{.mark} than they believe
they deserve are likely to [take military action]{.mark} because it
provides dramatic, visible, and unambiguous evidence of the state's
power and resolve.]{.underline}

Ward (2017, 825--26) claims that Larson and Shevchenko's interpretation
of SIT does not adequately distinguish mobility from competition.
However, this assertion stems from misreading the fundamentals of SIT,
where social competition clearly refers to seeking relative advantage
over the out-group (Turner 1975), not "acquisition of consensually
valued attributes," as Ward asserts. Social competition is a zero-sum
game. One group cannot be better unless another is worse (Brown and Ross
1982, 156--57). The higher-status group's identity is threatened by the
challenger, and it will attempt to hold on to its position by any means
available (Tajfel 1978, 88; Tajfel and Turner 1979, 38, 45--46; Brown
and Ross 1982). Although social creativity does not try to compete
directly with the out-group, but merely to win recognition in a
different domain, and thus is not subject to zero-sum logic, it may also
result in conflict if the higher-status group refuses to recognize
alternative criteria for status or the lowerstatus group's preeminence
on that dimension. When this happens, SIT predicts "intense hostility in
intergroup attitudes and . . . marked discrimination in intergroup
behavior" (Tajfel 1978, 97). Brown and Ross (1982) finds that
lower-status group members expressed anger and hostility toward the
higher-status group's belittling of its achievements. In short, "when a
group's action for positive distinctiveness is frustrated, impeded, or
in any way actively prevented by an out-group, this will promote overt
conflict and hostility between the groups" (Tajfel and Turner 1979, 46).

Ward's discussion of historical cases does little to strengthen his
overall argument since it is not clear why Wilhelmine Germany or
interwar Japan are "most likely" cases for SIT. If neither state faced
obstacles to its status ambitions before adopting imperialist policies,
then by definition SIT is not relevant. Moreover, Ward does not
demonstrate that China and Russia are similar to the cases of Germany or
Japan in the variables that caused them to engage in geopolitical
rivalry. Thus, it is hard to see how one can draw inferences from these
two historical cases about the policy implications for dealing with a
rising China and a resurgent Russia.

Conclusion and Policy Implications

Ward concludes that the United States should try to convince China and
Russia of the high costs or futility of status competition. **[[SIT and
empirical research]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, [[suggest]{.mark}
that US [efforts to frustrate]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[status]{.mark}
aspirations [of]{.mark}]{.underline} [[China and]{.mark} [Russia]{.mark}
will generate intense frustration]{.underline} and resentment (Deng
2008, 60), [[result]{.mark}ing [in]{.mark} a
[backlash]{.mark}]{.underline}, analogous to Russia's reaction to the
West's rejection of its efforts to be accepted as a player after the end
of the Cold War, but potentially more dangerous given China's increased
military spending and enhanced naval capabilities (Larson and Shevchenko
2019, 248--51). Rather than trying to impede their efforts to gain
increased influence, which could lead to military conflict, SIT implies
that [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should reinforce efforts by
Russia or China]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to achieve status through]{.mark}
social creativity in [nongeopolitical areas,]{.mark} such as
establishing new institutions]{.underline} or clubs, mediating
international conflicts, or controlling proliferation. Successful status
accommodation should be a continuing process and could involve formal
summits, working groups, or strategic dialogues. **[[Instead of
containment,]{.mark} the goal would be social
[cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, where the United States, Russia,
and China acknowledge each other's achievements or preeminence in
different issue areas, specialize in particular issues, or share
leadership roles (Larson and Shevchenko 2010, 95; 2019, 249--50). Ward
(2017, 831--32) confuses status accommodation with "appeasement" but
this is yet another misconception about SIT. In fact, SIT implies that a
[status accommodation strategy should be supplemented with continuing
investments]{.underline} in shaping perceptions of the stability and
legitimacy of the status hierarchy to avoid contributing to Russian or
Chinese beliefs that they can change their position unilaterally. This
means that the United States should preserve its overall military and
economic power and alliance networks. It should also ensure
international support for its global leadership by resisting
unilateralist temptations and by promoting universal rules.

**[2NC -- AT: Russian Revisionism]{.underline}**

**Russia is status-seeking, not revisionist**

Deborah **Larson and** Alexei **Shevchenko** **14**, "Russia says no:
Power, status, and emotions in foreign policy (j.postcomstud.2014.09.003
Communist and Post-Communist Studies ,Vol.47(3-4), p.269-279)

In this essay we outline a theoretical framework for explaining
ostensible shifts and vacillation in Russia\'s foreign policy. [Realism
would expect Russia to assert its predominance]{.underline} in
neighboring areas where it would come into conflict with the United
States and China. [Liberals would attribute Putin\'s anti-American
stance to his return to authoritarianism and domestic
repression]{.underline} and the corresponding need for an external
enemy. **[[A review of Russia\'s actions since the end of the Cold
War]{.mark},]{.underline}** however, **[[does not lend support
to]{.mark} either [power]{.mark} or domestic politics [as the main
source of variation in Russian foreign policy]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[[Instead,]{.mark} Russia\'s stance toward the United States has been
strongly influenced by the **degree of external
validation**]{.underline} [of its self-image as a great
power.]{.underline} [[Russia is **striving for enhanced global
recognition**]{.underline}]{.mark} while at the same time retaining its
national identity. Russia reacts strongly, at times emotionally, to
perceived humiliation and disrespect. We argue that a better
understanding of Russia\'s status concerns is essential not only to
understand Moscow\'s volatile behavior but to encourage its cooperation
in global governance. Our [[theoretical argument derives from social
identity theory]{.underline}]{.mark} (SIT) (Hogg and Abrams, 1988,
Tajfel, 1978, Tajfel, 1982, Tajfel and Turner, 1979) [[in social
psychology]{.underline}]{.mark}, which argues that social groups strive
for a positively distinctive identity and offers hypotheses concerning
the identity management strategies used by groups to enhance their
relative position. Extrapolating the identity management techniques
predicted by SIT to status-seeking in the international arena, we argue
that states may enhance their relative standing by imitating more
advanced states (strategy of social mobility), trying to displace the
higher-ranked state (strategy of social competition), or finding a new
arena in which to be superior (strategy of social creativity). Emotions
accompanying aggrieved status (in particular anger and vengefulness) can
explain the intensity of social competition as well as the breakdown of
social creativity efforts. We apply these theoretical insights to
Russian status-seeking since the end of the Cold War as a plausibility
probe. 1. Explaining Russia\'s assertiveness What explains Russia\'s
abrupt shifts and prickly sensitivity to alleged slights and insults?
Available theoretical explanations account neither for the pattern of
changes in Russian policy, nor for the tone of grievance frequently
adopted by Russian elites. [Russia\'s increased assertiveness might be
viewed as the inception of long-awaited "balancing" against U.S.
predominant power]{.underline}. Russia\'s opposition to U.S. initiatives
in the United Nations (U.N.) could be described as "soft balancing,"
that is, coalition-building and diplomatic bargaining within
international institutions to constrain the dominant power (Layne,
2006). On the other hand, a [genuine balancing strategy for Russia would
entail competition with the United States for predominant influence in
Eurasia]{.underline} while [forming]{.underline} [an anti-U.S. coalition
with China]{.underline} and other non-Western states, as advocated by
Russian Eurasianists, but [**Russia has avoided commitments** to these
states]{.underline} (Tsygankov, 2008, Tsygankov, 2014). **[An even more
pessimistic interpretation argues that Moscow is trying to overturn the
post-Cold War order]{.underline}**, restore its position as a global
superpower, and reassert control over its lost empire in a modern guise
(Bugajski, 2009, Lucas, 2014). While Russia\'s takeover of Crimea and
its behavior during the 2014 Ukrainian crisis seem on the surface to
validate this "offensive realist" reading of Russian foreign policy,
[[Russia\'s determination to prevent further enlargement of NATO]{.mark}
and its demand for a **droit de regard** (historically, an intrinsic
aspect of great power status in international politics), [should **not
be confused with imperial expansionism**.]{.mark} Russia\'s aspiring for
greater regional influence [may lead to spoiler behavior, but
not]{.mark} full-scale [revisionism]{.mark}.]{.underline} Others charge
that Russia\'s assertiveness reflects the "energy superpower" strategy,
an effort to use Russia\'s energy exports as an instrument of power and
prestige (Baev, 2008, Goldman, 2008). It is difficult to see how Russian
elites could reasonably expect to carry out such a policy, given
Russia\'s greater dependence on the European energy market (for
two-thirds of its foreign exchange revenue) than Europe\'s on Russian
gas (about 25 percent of their imports) (Trenin, 2007, p. 107). Relative
changes in the market price of oil and gas are imperfectly correlated
with Russia\'s overall stance toward the West. Russia\'s recent chilly
relations with the United States coincide with the emergence of U.S.
shale gas, which has lowered the market price of gas (Herszenhorn and
Kramer, 2013). Another explanation rooted in the liberal tradition and
popular among prominent Russia watchers views anti-Westernism in
Moscow\'s foreign policy as an attempt to distract public attention from
the growing centralization of Russia\'s domestic politics and shift
towards authoritarianism, camouflaged as "sovereign democracy" or
discourse about national specificity (Shevtsova, 2007, Shevtsova, 2010).
[Despite his anti-American rhetoric, though, Putin has **continued the
policy** of allowing U.S. military and supplies to transit through
Russian territory]{.underline} to [and]{.underline} from Afghanistan and
has cooperated [on]{.underline} important geopolitical problems such as
[removing chemical weapons from Syria and negotiating]{.underline} the
future of [Iran\'s nuclear program.]{.underline} A number of scholars
have attributed the deterioration of Russian relations with the United
States and Europe to Russia\'s desire to recover its status as a great
power and reaction to perceived humiliations by the United States, going
back to the 1990s when Russia\'s wishes on international security issues
were ignored (Stent, 2014, Sakwa, 2011, Simes, 2007, Trenin, 2006,
Tsygankov, 2008). Building on that insight, we attempt to place
Russia\'s status aspirations within a well-developed theoretical
framework from social psychology that relates social groups\' desire for
status to their strategies for achieving a positively distinctive
identity -- Social Identity Theory (SIT) (Larson and Shevchenko, 2003,
Larson and Shevchenko, 2010; Clunan, 2009). The next section discusses
SIT and a typology of strategies by which states can improve their
international standing. We also introduce complementary research on
emotions evoked by disrespect for status, depending on the target\'s
attribution of responsibility. In the third section, we apply this
framework to the Russian elite\'s 1990s status frustrations. The fourth
section analyzes Putin\'s social creativity strategy, and the fifth
discusses Putin\'s emotional reaction to the U.S. failure to accept
Russia as an equal. The sixth section reviews why President Obama\'s
efforts to redress some of Russia\'s status grievances failed, only to
provoke more intense anger from Russia and anti-American rhetoric. 2.
Identity, status and emotions According to SIT, social groups strive to
attain an identity that is both positive and distinctive ([Tajfel and
Turner,
1979](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib110),
[Turner,
1975](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib133)).
Similarly, states are concerned with intangible needs for positive
self-esteem and recognition as well as power and wealth. A group
assesses its relative standing through comparison to a reference group,
one that is similar but slightly superior ([Brown and Haeger,
1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib20)).
If the group\'s standing is inferior on important dimensions, it may
decide to pursue an identity management strategy. The group may try to
emulate a higher status group (social mobility), compete with it for
preeminence (social competition), or establish excellence in a different
area ([Tajfel and Turner,
1979](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib110)).
Applied to international relations, states may enhance their relative
standing by imitating more advanced states, trying to outdo the
higher-ranked state, or finding a new arena in which to be superior. To
be successful, a strategy of social mobility requires that elite group
boundaries be permeable to new members ([Ellemers et al.,
1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib33),
[Tajfel and Turner,
1979](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib110)).
If elite group boundaries are impermeable ([Ellemers,
1993](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib32))
and the status hierarchy is perceived as unstable or illegitimate,
groups may turn to social competition ([Turner and Brown,
1978](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib134)).
Social competition aims at besting the higher-status group in its own
domain, striving to be better on some comparative dimension ([Turner,
1975](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib133)).
Similarly, states engage in social competition when they strive to have
the most destructive weapons, acquire more clients than the other,
display advanced weapons in parades, intervene militarily against a
weaker power, prevent the other state from achieving particular goals or
act as a spoiler to block collective efforts to restore regional
stability. If existing status distinctions appear to be legitimately
based, or at least durable, groups may try to establish a new area in
which to be superior---social creativity. Groups may reevaluate what is
ostensibly a negative trait as positive, as in the "gay pride" movement.
Or groups may identify a new area in which they are better than the
established group ([Lemaine,
1974](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib67)).
The concept of "Asian values"---stressing that these states are more
harmonious, orderly, and communitarian than the individualistic and
materialistic West---is an example of this. States may use social
creativity to achieve prestige on criteria other than those
conventionally associated with being a great power (military
capabilities or economic weight) such as regional leadership, diplomatic
influence, economic growth rate, cultural achievements, or norm
entrepreneurship. For a social creativity strategy to succeed, the
higher-status group must accept the new value dimension as positive and
acknowledge that the lower-status group does indeed stand out on this
dimension ([Tajfel,
1978](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib108),
p. 96--97) The higher-status group is more likely to acknowledge the
out-group\'s accomplishments if it believes that its own position is
legitimate and secure (ibid., pp. 89--90). Refusal by the higher-status
group to recognize a group\'s status claims shows disrespect ([Wolf,
2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib136)),
which is likely to result in an escalation of inter-group competition
([Tajfel,
1978](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib108):
89--90) and increased hostility from the lower-status group ([Brown and
Ross,
1982](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib21)).
Having one\'s self-esteem or dignity reduced is humiliating ([Saurette,
2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib137)).
Reactions to perceived humiliations and slights are likely to exhibit
intense emotions. SIT provides a link between individual-level
psychological theories of emotion and collectivities such as states. SIT
holds that when individuals identify with a group, they experience
actions toward the group as if aimed at them personally---similar to
emotions experienced when a favorite soccer team wins or loses. Members
react emotionally to events that thwart or further group goals ([Sasley,
2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib95),
[Smith,
1993](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib103),
[Smith,
1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib104)).
Maintaining or improving group status is a fundamental goal. When a
group loses status, the emotions experienced depend on the perceived
cause of this loss. When the group perceives that its own actions were
responsible for loss of status, it will experience shame and
embarrassment ([Kemper,
1978](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib54),
p. 61). When others are perceived as responsible for loss of
status---through humiliation, withholding approval or deference, denial
of expected benefits---the group will display anger ([Kemper,
1978](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib54),
p. 128). The emotion of anger or irritation often leads to offensive
action tendencies against the out-group (designed to harm either
verbally or physically in retaliation for injuries to dignity and
prestige). Belief that the in-group is strong increases the level of
emotion and the likelihood of offensive action ([Mackie et al.,
2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib76)).
Anger is elicited by perception of injustice or illegitimacy. The
purpose of an offensive reaction is not merely to deter repeated
humiliations in the future, but to restore power and status, to return
the situation to a desired state of affairs ([Shaver et al.,
1987](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib96);
pp. 1077--1078). A lower-status group may experience malicious pleasure
or Schadenfreude at the misfortunes or failures of a higher-status
group, which is perceived to have mistreated it ([Leach et al.,
2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib65)).
Vengefulness is prompted by others\' unfair denial of status, and is
intended to restore actors to their rightful positions ([Barbalet,
1998](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib17),
p. 136). Unlike anger, which is an acute emotion, vengefulness may
endure over an extended period of time, motivating retaliatory action on
an occasion far removed from the original provocation ([Mackie et al.,
2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib76)).
The influence of both anger and vengefulness on status-seeking efforts
can be illustrated by Khrushchev\'s desire to get back at the Americans
for years of humiliating over flights of Soviet territory by spy planes.
When the Soviets shot down a U-2 spy plane less than two weeks before
the 1961 Paris summit, Khrushchev decided not to disclose the Soviet
downing of the plane, wait for the United States government to come up
with a false cover story about the missing plane, and then embarrass
Washington by revealing it to be false ([Taubman,
2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib112),
p. 446, 455, 458). After exposing President Eisenhower\'s equivocation,
Khrushchev demanded a personal apology, ending the summit before it
began ([Fursenko and Naftali,
2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib35),
p. 290). A focus on status-seeking, as well as the emotions accompanying
failure to win respect, helps to explain some of the shifts in Russian
foreign policy, beginning with the abandonment of Russia\'s immediate
post-Cold War policy of trying to integrate with the West, as we discuss
below. 3. Yeltsin\'s diplomacy: from social mobility to social
competition [The [collapse of the Soviet]{.mark} [Union
threatened]{.mark} both the value and distinctiveness of [Russia\'s
identity.]{.mark} Russia suffered profound internal and external
identity crises,]{.underline} exacerbated by the difficulty of adjusting
to the rapid decline in its status and loss of its position as a
superpower ([Hopf,
2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib48),
[Trenin,
2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib122)).
At the root of difficulties in post-Cold War relations between Russia
and the West was Russia\'s self-conception as a great power and the
West\'s refusal to accept that status. [In the early 1990s,]{.underline}
Foreign Minister Andrei [[Kozyrev]{.underline}]{.mark} and other Russian
liberals [[pursued a strategy of social mobility, aspiring to be
admitted to higher-status Western clubs]{.mark} such as GATT, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Group of Seven (G-7), and
even]{.underline} [the North Atlantic Treaty Organization]{.underline}
([CIS,
1992](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib24)).
[The [Clinton administration]{.mark}, however, [held off]{.mark}
admitting Russia]{.underline} into elite Western clubs until it was a
stable, capitalist democracy ([Stent,
2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib105),
p. 265). The U.S. decision in early 1994 to enlarge NATO to include
former members of the Warsaw Pact indicated that Russia would not be
admitted into "civilization," just as it appeared to be playing by the
rules ([Aron,
1998](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib3),
p. 33). As consolation, Russia was invited into the Partnership for
Peace, established in 1994 supposedly as a transition to NATO
membership, although it was unlikely that Russia would ever graduate
([Trenin,
2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib126),
p. 104). Negotiations for Russia\'s membership were prolonged by
insistence that Russia should have a special status, above the other
Eastern European states ([Light,
1996](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib68)).
Although Russia was a member of the Contact Group on the former
Yugoslavia, beginning [in August 1995, NATO carried out sustained
bombing of Serbian positions in Bosnia over Russia\'s fervent and loud
opposition]{.underline}, prompting heated rhetoric from Boris Yeltsin
about igniting "the flames of war in Europe" ([Lynch,
2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib74),
p. 16). [Widespread dissatisfaction with Kozyrev\'s
concessions]{.underline} to the West [led to his replacement as foreign
minister]{.underline} by Yevgeny Primakov ([Tsygankov,
2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib130),
pp. 83--84; [Trenin,
2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib122),
pp. 273--275). From 1996 to 1999, [Primakov used "multipolar" diplomacy
to restore Russia\'s status by forming diplomatic partnerships to check
the United States]{.underline}, a strategy of social competition
([Pushkov,
1998](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib83),
[Pushkov,
2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib84)).
Primakov tried to mediate on Iraq and Kosovo to establish Russia\'s
centrality as a key player ([Lo,
2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib69),
pp. 89--90, 107--108, 142). In the end, Primakov\'s balancing strategy
did not restrain the United States from enlarging NATO or carrying out
military action against Iraq and Yugoslavia ([Tsygankov,
2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib130),
p. 106). The [use of NATO to bomb Yugoslavia, bypassing the United
Nations Security Council]{.underline} where Russia had a veto, [was
regarded as particularly humiliating]{.underline} ([Baranovsky,
2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib16),
p. 454--455), [marking the end of the strategic partnership between
Russia and the West]{.underline} for many Russian elites ([Antonenko,
2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib2)).
Russian elites were particularly concerned that NATO had abandoned its
traditional defensive strategy, asserting the right to carry out
military actions outside its area of responsibility in the name of
humanitarian intervention ([Torkunov,
2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib121)).
The change in Russian foreign policy was symbolized by the "Primakov
loop" ([Trenin,
2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib126),
p. 105): when he learned of the Kosovo bombing, Primakov ordered his
plane, which was headed toward the United States, to turn around in
midair ([Goldgeier and McFaul,
2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib38),
p. 253). Russians sought to regain respect and to throw the U.S. off
balance by sending 200 Russian peacekeepers to capture the airport of
Pristina before NATO troops arrived, risking a dangerous military clash
between U.S. and Russian soldiers ([Talbott,
2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib111),
pp. 342--347). At the end of the 1990s, Russian efforts to regain great
power status seemed to be doomed to failure, with Moscow viewed as an
angry anachronism in world politics, making empty threats. Although
Russia was invited to join the G-7 in 1997, largely to mitigate
Yeltsin\'s humiliation over NATO\'s enlargement, the organization was
still "G-7 plus Russia," because Russia was only admitted to the
political side rather than to the conference of finance ministers
([Talbott,
2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib111),
p. 124, 237). The West declined to accept Russia as a member of the
elite clubs of NATO and the EU, although Russians believed that their
representatives should be at least co-chairs ([Trenin,
2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib123)).
In addition to the scope and complexity of economic and political
reforms required for Russia to be accepted, social mobility would have
entailed Russia\'s imitation of the higher-status Western states, a
humiliating position for a former superpower. To add insult to injury,
Russia\'s image was further damaged by Yeltsin\'s numerous health
problems and frequent erratic behavior fueled by too much alcohol during
foreign trips and dealings with foreign dignitaries. As Clinton\'s
former Deputy Secretary of State Strobe [Talbott
(2002)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib111)
reveals, U.S. officials sometimes took advantage of Yeltsin\'s drinking
problem to gain more concessions from Russia---perhaps a perfect
metaphor for the Russian perception of its relations with the U.S.
during the 1990s. [[By the turn of the millennium, optimistic
expectations]{.mark} that Russia would become a partner with the West
[were replaced with disillusionment]{.mark}]{.underline} and the belief
that Russia\'s interests had been ignored. Contrary to Yeltsin\'s and
others\' assumption that Russia would assume the status of a coequal
superpower with the United States, [Russia was treated]{.underline} by
the United States [as a defeated state and "junior partner"]{.underline}
([Pushkov,
2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib85),
[Simes,
2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib101)).
The gap between Russia\'s self-image as a great power and its reception
by the West evoked anger and frustration among Russian elites. [[In this
case, however, Russia did **not pursue**]{.mark} **social
[competition,]{.mark}** []{.mark}but sought to achieve prestige in a
different area]{.underline} than geopolitical might. 4. Putin\'s social
creativity Widespread realization of the futility of social competition
encouraged the formation of a new foreign policy strategy, one based on
a more accurate and realistic assessment of the post-Cold War status
hierarchy. Efforts at competing with the United States had been
humiliatingly fruitless, only accentuating Moscow\'s inferiority to
Washington. Russia\'s possession of Soviet status markers such as
nuclear weapons and a permanent seat in the U.N. Security Council were
increasingly irrelevant in a unipolar world where the United States was
able to act unilaterally. Primakov\'s diplomatic balancing and
partnerships with other major powers merely registered Russia\'s current
low standing while failing to generate new sources of Russian prestige
and legitimation in the post-Cold War system. In addition to its weak
economy and declining military, in contrast to the Cold War, Russia
lacked a militant anti-Western ideology that might have attracted
followers. In an era of peace between the leading international powers,
geopolitical competition (the most visible manifestation of social
competition in the past) remained largely subdued ([Jervis,
2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib51)).
After recovering from the shock of unipolarity and having restored a
modicum of economic and political stability in the early 2000s, Russian
leaders themselves realized that they did not wish to change the
international system but to achieve a higher status position within it.
Accordingly, [Yeltsin\'s successor]{.underline}, Vladimir [Putin decided
to seek status by identifying new areas where Russia could assume a
prominent role]{.underline}---a strategy of social creativity. Not
surprisingly in light of Russia\'s stunning decline in the 1990s,
[Putin\'s principal foreign policy goal]{.underline} upon his election
at the end of 1999 [was to restore Russia\'s great power
status]{.underline} ([Hanson,
2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib42),
[Lo,
2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib70),
[Mankoff,
2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib77),
pp. 23--24). [[Putin seized the opportunity provided
by]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[September 11]{.mark}, 2001, terrorist
attacks against the United States to reframe Russia\'s identity
as]{.underline} a [partner]{.underline} with the West in the war on
terror [and [to align with the United States]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Lo,
2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib70),
pp. 124--125, 128--129). President George W. [Bush and Putin declared
their relationship a "strategic partnership." Russia shared with the
United States valuable political and military intelligence]{.underline}
about international terrorists, [allowed U.S. planes to fly over Russian
territory, acquiesced to U.S. military bases in Central Asia,
participated in international search and rescue missions, and gave
increased assistance to an anti-Taliban force in
Afghanistan]{.underline}, the Northern Alliance ([Aron,
2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib4)).
[Before the 2001]{.underline} November [U.S.--Russia summit, Putin
privately compared his relationship with Bush to that between Franklin
Roosevelt and Winston Churchill]{.underline} during World War II ([Baker
and Glasser,
2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib12),
p. 135). [This attempt at becoming a partner]{.underline} with the
United States, however, [required validation by the United
States.]{.underline} 5. Aggrieved status, emotions, and a crisis for
social creativity For social creativity to be successful, the dominant
power must accept the aspiring state\'s efforts to attain recognition in
a new area. [[The Bush administration,]{.mark} however[, did not regard
Russia as an equal partner]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Hanson,
2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib42),
p. 173; [Shevtsova,
2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib98),
p. 230), [as became apparent with]{.underline} Bush\'s [failure to
consult]{.underline} with Putin [before invading Iraq, a former Soviet
client]{.underline} where Russia had substantial financial stakes
([Balmforth,
2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib15)).
[Instead of showing respect]{.underline} for Russia\'s status as a
regional power, with a droit de regard in the post-Soviet space, [the
Bush administration supported "color" revolutions]{.underline} in
Georgia (2003), Ukraine (2004), and Kyrgyzstan (2005), regime changes
that were perceived as humiliating interference in Russia\'s backyard.
The Ukrainian "Orange Revolution," in particular, was a shock and
personal slap on the face for Putin, who had staked his personal
reputation on victory for the pro-Russian candidate, only to see the
election results overturned as fraudulent by the Ukrainian opposition
and the West ([Shevtsova,
2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib98),
p. 230, 237--238, 240; [Lo,

p. 94; [Mankoff,

p. 117, 119, 123; [Judah,
2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib52),
pp. 84--86). [**[Putin complained about the lack of respect]{.mark}**
showed to Russia]{.underline}, as in December 2004 when he compared the
United States to a "strict uncle in a pith helmet instructing others how
to live their lives," and in 2006 when he referred to the United States
as wolf "who knows who to eat and is not about to listen to anyone"
([Shevtsova,
2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib98),
p. 233[). In his emotional and bellicose February 2007 Munich address,
Putin accused the United States of having "overstepped its national
borders in every way,"]{.underline} as evidenced by the "economic,
political, cultural, and educational policies it imposes on other
nations" ([Putin,
2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib86)).
At a Victory Day celebration in May 2007, Putin [even obliquely compared
U.S. policies to those of the Third Reich]{.underline} ([Kramer,
2007a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib55),
[Kramer,
2007b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib56)).
As the literature on status, power, and emotions would predict, emotions
of anger and vengefulness associated with not receiving due recognition
led to offensive reactions, which were amplified by perceptions of the
increased strength of the lower-status party. Russian elites were more
confident in making claims to great power status given the increase in
the price of oil from \$27 a barrel in 2000 to \$130 a barrel by
mid-2008 ([Stent,
2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib106),
p. 1092). As the minister of defense Sergei Ivanov wrote in 2006,
"Russia has now completely recovered the status of great power that
bears global responsibility for the situation on the planet and the
future of human civilization" ([Tsygankov,
2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib131),
p. 49). Russia reacted harshly to U.S. plans to deploy elements of its
missile defense system, ostensibly directed at Iran, on Polish and Czech
territory in 2007---including threatening to withdraw from the 1987
Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty---in part because the missile
interceptors could be the basis for a larger system undermining
Russia\'s nuclear deterrent ([RFE/RL Newsline,
2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib90))
but primarily because Russia had once again been excluded from a major
European security decision, contrary to the prerogatives of a great
power ([Economist,
2007b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib114),
p. 70). The [Russians felt that the United States had violated its
commitment not to deploy significant conventional military forces on the
territories of states recently added to NATO]{.underline}, part of the
1997 Russia-NATO Founding Act. The choice of the Czech Republic and
Poland as the site of the initial deployment heightened Russian ire over
NATO\'s enlargement ([Pikayev,
2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib82),
[Slocombe,
2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib102)).
[Nevertheless,]{.underline} at the June 2007 G8 summit in Heiligendamm,
Germany, [Putin offered to allow the United States to use the radar at
Azerbaijan as part of a joint missile defense system]{.underline},
adding a newly built radar to the offer at a follow-up summit with Bush
in Kennebunkport, Maine ([Economist,
2007a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib113)).
[The United States rejected Putin\'s offer of cooperation]{.underline}
on the grounds that the radars were not technically suitable. [A month
later, Putin suspended Russian cooperation with the Conventional Forces
in Europe Treaty]{.underline} ([Kramer and Shanker,
2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib60))
and in August, he resumed regular strategic bomber patrols over the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans ([Kramer,

[[Russia\'s **desire to assert its comeback**]{.underline}]{.mark} on

2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib97),
pp. 204--207). On August 7, [[Georgia]{.mark}n President]{.underline}
Mikhail [Saakashvili [launched an]{.mark} artillery [attack]{.mark}
followed by ground invasion of the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali,
killing several Russian peacekeepers. Saakashvili had hoped to seize
South Ossetia as a fait accompli, before Russia had time to react.
[Russian troops]{.mark} subsequently [occupied important towns]{.mark}
of Georgia]{.underline}, apart from South Ossetia, and the Russian Air
Force destroyed much of Georgia\'s military infrastructure [[to teach
the Georgians a lesson]{.underline}]{.mark} ([Trenin,
2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib126),
p. 30). [Putin felt that Russia\'s status as a great power was
threatened.]{.underline} Putin intervened in Georgia primarily to
reassert Russia\'s predominant interest in the area, which was
endangered by the possibility of imminent membership for Georgia and
Ukraine in NATO. Saakashvili\'s foreign policy priorities were for
Georgia to join Western security and economic structures and to reassert
control over the breakaway provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
Viewing Saakashvili as a model democratic reformer (even after his
November 2007 crackdown on the political opposition), the Bush
administration encouraged his efforts to restore Georgian territorial
integrity instead of acting as an honest broker in resolving the "frozen
conflict" ([Cooley and Mitchell,
2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib28)).
In April 2008, the NATO Summit at Bucharest promised Ukraine and Georgia
eventual membership in NATO (not a membership action plan), although
Putin had joined the summit for the first time to express his objections
in person, informing Bush that this was a "red line" for Russia ([Cooper
et al.,
2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib29),
[Asmus,
2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib6),
pp. 134--135). The NATO-Bucharest decision, a compromise between the
French-German and U.S. positions, achieved the worst of both worlds,
angering the Russians without satisfying the Ukrainians or Georgians
([Trenin,
2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib126),
p. 28). In addition to anger, [vengefulness was an important factor in
Russia\'s response to Georgia]{.underline}\'s attempt to take over the
disputed provinces. In February 2008, the West had recognized Kosovo\'s
unilateral declaration of independence without UN approval, an action
that Putin had strongly opposed. Russian diplomats had drawn comparisons
between Kosovo and the Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
If Kosovo could be independent, why not the breakaway provinces of
Georgia ([Antonenko,
2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib2))?
Georgian President Saakashvili was also aware of the parallels,
cautioning EU leaders and U.S. officials that Russia was likely to
retaliate against Georgia if Kosovo were allowed to secede from Serbia
without Russian approval, but Western diplomats assured him that Russia
was bluffing ([Asmus,
2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib6),
p. 100). Shortly after the Georgian war, Russia recognized South Ossetia
and Abkhazia as independent states, although none of the other states in
the Commonwealth of Independent States followed suit, including even
Belarus. [[Russia\'s **emotional response**]{.underline}]{.mark} to
Georgian defiance [[**was costly.** Although Russia]{.mark} easily [won
the war, foreign capital flight damaged the Russian
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}, as the benchmark Russian Trading System
index fell by nearly fifty percent ([Kramer,
2008a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib57),
[Kramer,
2008b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib58)).
From the Georgian war onward, Russia would no longer tolerate further
expansion of NATO or expansion of U.S. influence into states of the
former Soviet Union. Russian President [Medvedev
(2008)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib78)
affirmed Russia\'s "privileged interests" in the post-Soviet space. As
noted by [Lukyanov
(2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib73),
for Russia the war "was something approaching psychological revenge
after a 20-year geopolitical retreat, proof that Moscow can say no." 6.
Anger mismanagement [[The Obama]{.mark} administration\'s policy to
["reset"]{.mark} relations]{.underline} with Russia, inaugurated in
February 2009, [[was based]{.mark} in part [on redressing injured
Russian prestige]{.mark}]{.underline} and national pride. The term
"reset" implied that the Obama administration was jettisoning aspects of
President Bush\'s foreign policy that were most objectionable to Russia,
such as wooing countries in the post-Soviet space or placing missiles
and radars in former members of the Warsaw Pact, while cooperating with
Russia on issues of common interest. [[For Russian]{.mark} leaders the
**[major appeal]{.mark} of the "reset" policy [was the promise of a more
equal relationship]{.mark}** with Washington.]{.underline} Since its
possession of a sizable nuclear arsenal is one of the few remaining
areas where Russia and the U.S. are equals, the Russian side was pleased
that Obama initiated negotiations for a new START agreement, signed in
spring 2010 and promptly ratified by the U.S. Senate and Russian Duma
([Goldgeier,
2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib37),
p. 23). START negotiations emerged as an important vehicle for restoring
Russia\'s status as at least a "quasi-superpower" ([Economist,
2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib115),
p. 23). Russian leaders reciprocated by agreeing to open up an air
corridor, allowing up to 4500 flights per year of U.S. troops and
equipment to Afghanistan. By spring 2011 twenty percent of American
cargo and fifty percent of U.S. troops transited through Russia
([Economist,
2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib118)).
The Obama administration refrained from directly criticizing Russian
treatment of dissidents or human rights ([Baker,
2009a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib9)).
The Russian leadership was also relieved by Obama\'s September 2009
decision to put on the back burner another humiliating
issue---deployment of the U.S. missile defense systems in Eastern
Europe--in favor of a four-phased system in which the first phase would
consist of smaller missile interceptors based on ships and aimed at
Iranian missiles ([Baker,
2009b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib10)).
During her July 2010 tour of the former Soviet states, Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton emphasized that the United States would maintain
good relations with Russia as well as with Georgia, Ukraine, and
Azerbaijan ([Economist,
2010b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib117)).
[[**Russian foreign policy moved in a more constructive and pragmatic
direction**, as reflected in improvement of]{.underline}]{.mark}
previously tense [[relations with Poland and the Baltics, settlement of
the]{.mark} marine [border with Norway, greater reliance on soft
power]{.mark}]{.underline} instruments [[in its relationship
with]{.mark} post-Yushchenko [Ukraine, and presentation]{.mark}, as
Medvedev termed it, [of "a smiling face to the
world]{.mark}"]{.underline} ([Interfax,
2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib49)).
In addition to appreciation of the status accommodation aspects of the
"reset," Moscow\'s cooperation was motivated by recognition of the
dangers of dependence on natural resource exports and the need to
diversify, a realization that was brought home by the 2008--2009
financial crisis, and a goal that would require cooperation with the
West to obtain foreign investment and technology. [Cooperation between
Russia and the United States reached its height in spring 2010, when
Obama and Medvedev signed the New START Treaty]{.underline} in Prague
([Baker and Bilefsky,
2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib11));
[U.S., French, and British troops were invited]{.underline} for the
first time [to participate in Moscow\'s]{.underline} annual May 9
[Victory Day parade]{.underline} to commemorate victory over Nazi
Germany in World War II ([Economist,
2010a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib116);
[Barry,
2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib18));
and Russia reached agreement with other permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council on the most severe sanctions yet against Iran\'s
nuclear program. Moscow later canceled the sale of advanced S-300
ground-to-air missiles to Iran ([Sanger and Kramer,
2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib138)).
[[Despite]{.mark} these [promising beginnings,]{.mark} in 2011--2012
[the reset entered a period of diminishing returns]{.mark}]{.underline},
largely [because the policy was focused on]{.underline} obtaining
[agreements on particular issues, without connection to a larger vision
for the relationship.]{.underline} As observed by Thomas Graham (2011),
a former senior director for Russia in the Bush White House, the problem
with the "reset" was that it never had a coherent answer for "what the
two countries should aspire to now so as to foreclose a return to
dangerous geopoliticl rivalry and hold open the promise of mutually
advantageous strategic partnership," ([Russia Profile Experts,
2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib91)).
[Aiming to assuage some of the symptoms of Russia\'s anger and
frustration, the reset [**ultimately failed to address the root cause**s
of Moscow\'s grievances]{.mark} over its loss of status.]{.underline} As
a recent study of U.S.--Russian relations notes, "a central Russian
objective has been to regain its status as a great power and be treated
as an equal by the United States---a goal that was constantly
frustrated" ([Stent,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib107),
p. xi). [In June 2011, the NATO-Russia Council]{.underline}, created in
2002 for joint projects and cooperation, [rejected Moscow\'s idea of a
joint anti-missile system]{.underline} in favor of two separate systems
linked by information exchange. [To add to the humiliation, the U.S. and
its NATO allies turned down Russia\'s demands for legally binding
guarantees]{.underline} and technical limitations to ensure that future
European ABM systems would not be directed against Russia ([Ivanov,
2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib50)).
In a replay of the 2007 dispute, Russia reacted angrily to Obama\'s
decision to proceed with a European missile defense system that would
entail putting missile interceptors in Romania and Poland, including
warning of a possible preemptive strike against missile defense sites
([Clover and Dyer,
2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib26)).
In his May 9, 2012 speech commemorating the anniversary of victory over
Nazi Germany, President Putin, elected in March, declared that Russia
had "a great moral right" to the respect of other nations, because of
its role in defeating Nazi Germany. He informed President Obama that he
would not be attending the G-8 summit meeting that the U.S. president
had moved to Camp David---so that Putin would not feel excluded from the
subsequent NATO summit in Chicago---because he was needed in Moscow to
help select the new cabinet (the responsibility of Prime Minister Dmitri
Medvedev) ([Cooper and Barry,
2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib30)).
This was a snub, perhaps in retaliation for Obama\'s failure to attend
the Asia--Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Vladivostok.
Humiliated and angered by the 2011--2012 domestic protests accompanying
Putin\'s return to presidency, Putin\'s team once again invoked the
threat of Washington-sponsored "color revolutions," at one point
directly blaming the U.S. Department of State and Secretary of State
Hillary Rodham Clinton for sponsoring the opposition movement
([Anishchuk and Gutterman,
2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib1);
[Trenin,
2013a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib127)).
Even the triumph of Russia\'s 2012 admission into the WTO, after two
decades of negotiations, was marred by Russian status grievances.
[Russian political circles were predictably enraged by the decision of
the U.S. Congress to replace the obsolete Cold War-era Jackson--Vanik
amendment]{.underline} (which conditioned trade relations with the USSR
on freedom of Jewish emigration) [with the December]{.underline} 2012
Sergey [Magnistky Rule of Law Accountability Act]{.underline} (which
denied visas to Russian officials implicated in "gross human rights
violations" and froze their U.S. assets), [viewing it as intolerable
interference in their domestic affairs]{.underline} ([Herszenhorn,
2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib43)).[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#fn1)
According to Alexei Pushkov, chair of the Russian Duma\'s international
affairs committee, the Magnitsky Act reflected American "pure double
standards." Russia was castigated for its human rights practices while
authoritarian partners of the U.S., including China, continued to get a
pass from Washington ([Weir,
2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib135)).
[Russia responded tit for tat]{.underline}, first with a bill targeting
political nongovernmental organizations receiving financial support from
the United States and prohibiting U.S. adoptions of Russian orphans. The
latter provision was ostensibly designed to protect Russian children
from abuse by American parents, but attracted much opposition within
Russia, including from some members of Putin\'s cabinet ([Economist,
2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib120)).
A day after the United States released the name of Russian officials
subject to sanctions Russia provided its own list of eighteen current
and former U.S. officials who would be barred from entering Russia. A
spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Alexander Lukashevich,
commented that the United States must realize that it cannot conduct its
relationship with Moscow "in the spirit of mentoring and undisguised
diktat" ([Barry,
2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib19)).
Putin\'s resentment over the West\'s use of Russia\'s March 2011
abstention, rather than a veto, of a UN SC resolution 1973, allowing the
NATO air campaign against Gaddafi\'s troops in Libya, to promote "regime
change" in that country contributed to Russia\'s falling out with the
West over the civil war in Syria, which broke out in 2012 ([Economist,
2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib119)).
Tellingly, Putin initially signaled his willingness to cooperate with
the U.S. in stopping the war and leading the post-conflict peace
process, but insisted that this should be a cooperation of equals, a
condition which Washington, despite the reset rhetoric, refused to
accept ([Trenin,
2013b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib128)).
By saying "no" to Western intervention in Syria and by supporting Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad in his military campaign against rebels Putin
aimed at restoring Russia\'s status as an "indispensable power" in
global politics and earning the respect of China and other rising powers
([Baev,
2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib8)).
Russian status concerns and related emotions were prominently on display
in the summer 2013 Russo-American spat over the fate of Edward Snowden,
a former National Security Agency contractor, who fled the United States
to Hong Kong and later to Moscow after exposing the U.S. government\'s
wide-ranging communications surveillance programs. While attempting to
avoid damaging relations with Washington (Putin publicly demanded that
Snowden stop leaking information damaging to the U.S. national security
as a pre-condition of his stay in Russia), the Russian side ultimately
could not afford to succumb to American pressure to extradite Snowden
due to considerations of prestige. The decision to grant Snowden
temporary political asylum in Russia was influenced by "Russian
irritation at the U.S. presumption that the American justice system\'s
demands must be honored but that Washington is free to criticize and
impugn the activities of Russian courts and law enforcement" ([Gvosdev,
2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib41)).
The Russian response was also in part driven by vengefulness. Putin
could not resist the temptation to embarrass the U.S. by exposing the
hypocrisy of American democratic rhetoric and by positioning Russia as a
genuine protector of civil liberties. As Putin declared, tongue-in-cheek
to the laughter and applause of his audience in May 2014, "Russia is not
a country that extradites fighters for human rights" ([Kremlin.ru,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib61)).
In the end, Russian (and American) status concerns wound up contributing
to a new low point in the relationship, leading to the U.S. decision to
cancel the Obama--Putin meeting originally planned at the sidelines of
the September 2013 G-20 summit in St. Petersburg, the first time an
American president had called off a bilateral summit in decades ([Baker
and Meyers,
2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib14)).
An opportunity for cooperation with the United States, however,
unexpectedly presented itself when it became clear in September 2013
that the Obama administration faced the likelihood of failing to secure
congressional authorization for punitive military strikes against Syria.
Russian diplomats seized the moment by promoting a plan to place
Syria\'s chemical weapons under international control, thus helping the
U.S. to save face by embracing a diplomatic solution to the crisis and
at the same time enhancing Russia\'s prestige as a world power broker
([Baker and Gordon,
2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib13)).
This episode of social creativity, however, could not prolong the life
of the "reset" relationship. In addition to halting further expansion of
NATO, since the 2008 war with Georgia Russia has resisted the extension
of the European Union\'s economic domain to the former Soviet sphere.
Moscow\'s distrust of the European Union was further provoked by the
European Union\'s Eastern Partnership Program, which was presented as a
"civilizational choice" for post-Soviet states---a characterization
likely to be regarded as an insult by Moscow. At the same time, Putin,
who had previously included Russia within the European cultural sphere,
started positioning Russia as a unique civilization, a genuine
repository of traditional Christian values in contrast to the moral
decadence of contemporary Europe ([Merry,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib80),
[Aron,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib5)).
Moscow applied pressure on Moldova, Armenia, and Ukraine not to sign
association and free trade agreements with the EU (which could disrupt
those countries\' economic ties with Russia) in favor of joining a
Russia-led customs union, the first step in Putin\'s ambitious project
for a Eurasian Union, an economic and civilizational project separate
from the West ([Herszenhorn,
2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib44)).
As the Russian political class was basking in the triumph of the
successful 2014 winter Olympics games in Sochi---the most expensive
Olympic Games in history, designed to celebrate Russia\'s resurgence as
a great power and Putin\'s personal vanity project ([Herzenhorn,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib46))---the
biggest crisis in Russia\'s relationship with the West since the end of
the Cold War struck. [[When the Ukrainian president]{.mark} Viktor
Yanukovich, who had earlier declined to sign the EU partnership
agreement under Russian pressure, [was toppled by the street protest
movement]{.mark}]{.underline} and fled in the evening of February 21,
2014, [[Putin immediately perceived]{.mark} his ouster as [yet another
"orange revolution."]{.mark} He treated it not only as a geopolitical
threat]{.underline} (since it raised the possibility of Kiev\'s reneging
on the 2010 agreement that allowed Russia to station its fleet in Crimea
until 2042), [but also as a personal humiliation, which this time, a
full decade after the first one, he was determined not to tolerate.
While Russia]{.underline} undoubtedly [had contingency plans for sudden
instability]{.underline} in Ukraine, as some Western analysts pointed
out, [[Putin\'s subsequent behavior can **better** be **explained
as**]{.mark} "[fundamentally driven by]{.mark} psychological impulses
and **[highly emotional responses]{.mark}**"]{.underline} to the crisis
([Mendelson and Harvey,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib79)),
an "angry and ad hoc" reaction to the situation in Kiev ([Sakwa,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib93)).
[The presence in the provisional Ukrainian government]{.underline} [of
several ultra-nationalists]{.underline} (a few of whom had publicly
praised Nazism and embraced the legacy of Stepan Bandera, the Ukrainian
World War II nationalist leader who fought with the Nazis against the
Soviet army) [and their immediate call for rescinding the status of
Russian as a second language]{.underline}, later vetoed by the interim
president, along with other anti-Russian measures, [gave Putin the
ground to denounce the new provisional regime as
illegitimate]{.underline}, extremist, Russophobic, and pro-fascist
([Kramer,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib59)).
[Within a week, Russian special operations forces and troops secured
control over strategic locations across the peninsula]{.underline},
while the Crimean parliament, partially disbanded and partially voting
in the presence of the masked gunmen who were under control of Sergei
Aksyonov, alias "Goblin," known for his connections with the mafia,
declared independence from Ukraine and scheduled a referendum on joining
Russia ([Reuters,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib89)).
Moscow first manipulated and then was quick to recognize the fraudulent
results of the referendum. On March 18, 2014, Putin and Crimean leaders
signed a treaty of accession making Crimea and the city of Sevastopol
(the location of the Russian Black Sea Fleet) parts of the Russian
Federation ([Meyers and Barry,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib81)).
Putin\'s address to the country\'s political elite before signing the
accession treaty was emotional and defiant in the face of the threat of
Western economic sanctions and Russia\'s expulsion from the G-8. Putin
emphasized that after the Soviet collapse, the Russian people became
"one of the biggest---if not the biggest---divided nation in the world"
and pledged to protect the rights of compatriots abroad. He appealed to
Russian history, pride, and glory, but also to shame over losing the
former superpower status by calling the loss of Crimea after the
collapse of the Soviet Union an "outrageous historical injustice" which
Russia had to accept because it was simply too weak to protect its
interests. He scorned the West for accusing Russia of violating
international law and invoked the right of nations to self-determination
to justify Russia\'s actions in Crimea. If Ukraine could secede from the
USSR and Kosovo Albanians were permitted by the West to separate from
Serbia, then citizens of Crimea had the right to join with Russia. The
Russian president also revisited several themes of his 2007 Munich
speech, lamenting the loss of stability in international politics after
the end of bipolarity and accusing the United States of attempting to
rule by force. He recited the list of state grievances over not being
treated as an equal partner, ranging from the enlargement of NATO and
the 1999 bombings of Belgrade to the threat of sanctions over Crimea and
continuing restrictions on Russian import of technologies and exports.
In short, in his view, Western behavior constituted a return to the
eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth century policies of containment,
which Russia could no longer tolerate. By recognizing the interim
Ukraine government, which quickly emerged after the departure of
Yanukovich, the United States and the EU had crossed a "red line."
"Russia found itself in a position it could not retreat from. If you
compress the spring all the way to its limit, it will snap back hard."
Like other countries Russia had its "own national interests that need to
be taken into account and respected" ([Putin,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib87)).
[After taking over Crimea, Russia engaged in spoiler behavior designed
to humiliate and destabilize Ukraine]{.underline} by providing military,
economic, and political support to the pro-Russian separatists in the
Ukraine\'s south-east, the majority of whom were Russian citizens, led
by two former FSB (Federal\'naya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti, the successor to
the KGB) officers, Alexander Borodai and Igor Girkin (with the nickname
Strelkov), who later resigned ([Buckley,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib22)).
Russia\'s overarching goal was probably to force the Ukrainian
authorities to accept federalization of the country, which would have
weakened Kiev\'s control over the southeast and eliminated the very
possibility of future Ukrainian membership in NATO ([Fenenko,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib34)).
Moscow remained defiant when faced with the threat of Western economic
sanctions, Russia\'s de-facto expulsion from the G-8, and international
outrage over the July 17, 2014 destruction of Malaysian Airlines Flight
17 with 298 passengers on board over eastern Ukraine---a tragedy
attributed to the pro-Russian separatists\' inability to distinguish
between a military target and a civilian passenger jet, but also
potentially implicating Russia, which was suspected of delivering
powerful anti-aircraft missiles to the rebels ([MacFarquhar,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib75)).
[With the remnants of Russia\'s social creativity supplanted by what one
journalist dubbed "the ideology of ressentiment" over the loss of
"imperial greatness"]{.underline} ([Remnick,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib88),
p. 61), [U.S.--Russian relations increasingly appeared to be an
escalating rivalry]{.underline}, analogous to the nineteenth century
Great Game between Russia and Britain for influence over Central and
South Asia---except for the asymmetric character of the twenty-first
century version---with the U.S. and Russia competing for influence over
such states as Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia ([Trenin,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib129)).
According to historian [Geyer (1987, p.
205)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib36),
the Great Game for Russia was motivated by considerations of prestige
and the desire to at least appear to be a great power. [Karaganov
(2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib53),
an influential Russian foreign policy expert, suggested a more troubling
historical analogy to a Western-imposed "velvet-gloved version of the
Versailles policy" which "by pushing Russia into the periphery of global
politics" had unleashed "a kind of Weimar syndrome in Russia, a great
nation whose dignity and interests were trampled underfoot." 7.
Conclusion Although the danger of military conflict among major powers
has dramatically receded in the post-Cold War era, states continue to
compete for status and prestige. The desire for status is particularly
acute for Russia, which suffered a catastrophic decline in its position
in the 1990s and has viewed itself as a great power for centuries.
Consistent with psychological research and theory, Russia responded
emotionally to perceived humiliation. [The Russian takeover of Crimea
and the 2014 Ukrainian crisis illustrate the risk that continued Russian
bitterness over its loss of great power status could lead to a return of
geopolitical competition.]{.underline} As [Deng (2008, p.
292)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X14000610#bib31)
observes in his study of Chinese status concerns, "withholding due
status recognition based on zero-sum power politics logic and negative
stereotype-driven categorization is a recipe for a traditional
great-power struggle." **[[Perceived humiliation and status dissonance
better account for twists and turns in Russia\'s relationship with the
West than more conventional]{.mark} power or interest-based
[explanations.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Russia was obstructionist and
vocal in opposing U.S. policies in the late nineties, when Russia\'s
economy was on the verge of collapse. Since late 2011, Russia has been
assertive and anti-Western, despite lower energy prices and lessened
European dependence on Russian gas. [Contrary to the idea that Russia\'s
policy reflects cold calculation of consistent national interests,
Putin\'s emotional rhetoric and defiant reaction to Western criticism
discourages needed foreign investment in Russia\'s economy. Periods of
U.S.--Russian cooperation have coincided with efforts by U.S.
policymakers to show respect for Russia as an equal partner, as in the
initial phase of the reset policy. At the same time, Russian elites are
hypersensitive, and may overreact to perceived insults]{.underline} that
were not intended as such. Domestic politics within the United States is
a complicating factor, as the Obama administration was unable to prevent
passage by Congress of the Magnitsky Act. The literature on identity,
status and emotions suggests that isolation and exclusion of emerging
great powers will evoke anger, vengefulness, and competition to supplant
the dominant powers. [Continued indifference to Russia\'s great power
aspirations, especially in the former Soviet space, will encourage
Russian elites\' sense of injury and humiliation]{.underline}, possibly
[leading to further conflict.]{.underline}

**Deterrence theory wrong -- Russia has an [idiosyncratic
culture]{.underline} that prohibits leaders from publicly displaying
weakness. Pro deterrence theorists wrongly universalize western
psychology.**

Holbrooke's attitude is instructive because it marked the thinking of
other advocates of NATO expansion (and still does). They believed that
[Russians]{.underline}, especially the democrats among them, [could not
truly believe that an enlarged NATO posed a threat to their
country]{.underline}. Stated diferently, [**[US officials]{.mark}**
committed to expanding the alliance]{.underline} seemed to
**[[believe]{.mark} that [the only reasonable way Russia could]{.mark}
[view their policy was the way]{.mark} that [they themselves viewed
it.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In consequence, [they regarded Russian
objections as,]{.underline} in the main, [rhetoric designed for domestic
consumption]{.underline}, the result of misunderstanding of US
intentions, or simple paranoia. They also believed that Russia's leaders
could be won over by a variety of means, whether economic aid and
inclusion in the Partnership for Peace or inclusion in security forums
such as the Russia--NATO Consultative Council, and that personal
chemistry between Russian and US presidents, notably Boris Yeltsin and
Bill Clinton's bonhomie, would calm Moscow's anxiety.

[This view discounted the possibility that [Russian leaders]{.mark}
would [regard the alliance's movement]{.mark} eastward [toward their
country's borders as provocative]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[and
disingenuous]{.mark} given US assurances that the Cold War was over and
that Russia was a partner]{.underline}. In an October 1993 cable that
was subsequently declassifed, Yeltsin insisted to Clinton that 'the
spirit of the treaty of the fnal settlement with respect to Germany
\[i.e., the deal under which a unifed Germany became part of NATO\],
signed in September 1990, especially its provisions that prohibit\[ed\]
the deployment of foreign troops in the eastern lands of the Federal
Republic of Germany, preclude\[d\] the option of expanding the NATO zone
into the east' (National Security Archive 1993). The question of whether
the USA pledged not to expand NATO remains disputed. Jack Matlock
(quoted in Zelikow 1995), the USA's last ambassador to the Soviet Union,
insists that '[[we gave]{.mark} categorical [assurances]{.mark} to
Gorbachev back when the Soviet Union existed that [if a **united
German** were able to stay in NATO, NATO would not]{.mark} be
[move]{.mark}d [east]{.mark}ward]{.underline}.' Philip Zelikow (1995),
who served on the National Security Council from 1989 to 1991,
disagrees, contending that the USA provided merely the assurance that
the alliance's military forces and equipment would not be moved into the
territory of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Academics
remain divided on the matter (MccGwire 1998; Shifrinson 2016; Kramer
2009; Sarotte 2014).

In the end, however, **[it does not matter whether the George H.W. Bush
administration ever gave Soviet president Mikhail Gorbacheva
binding]{.underline}**, let alone written, [**commitment** not to
enlarge NATO in exchange for]{.underline} Moscow's cooperation on
[German unification. [The Russians believed]{.mark} that they had been
given an assurance and that [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates later
[reneged]{.mark}]{.underline}---at a time when Russia was beset by
weakness, unable to push back, and did not pose any military threat to
Europe. Opponents of NATO expansion had warned [that Russia's leaders
would interpret expansion precisely that way and would be unmoved by the
argument that it was needed to provide security]{.underline} to and
foster democracy in the lands to NATO's east (Mandelbaum 1996, 1997;
GovInfo 1997). After all, Russia was scarcely in a position to attack
its western neighbors. During the 1990s, its economy contracted by
one-third (Reddaway and Glinski 2001; Rutland 1997) and, in the words of
a leading expert on the Russian military, the country 'was left with a
shambles of an army and a totally confused military doctrine'
(Felgenhauer 1997). As for promoting democracy, it would surely have
made sense to apply the underlying logic---namely that military
alliances advance democracy and that the latter fosters peace---to
Russia, by far the most consequential of the ex-communist countries in
Europe. And, as Clinton and his foreign policy team understood, during
the Yeltsin years Russia's democratic experiment was under siege from
both the communists (led by Gennady Zyuganov) and the nationalists (such
as Vladimir Zhirinovsky), both unrelenting critics of NATO expansion
(Berger 2005). There was, to be sure, the prospect of a resurgent
Russia, but including it in NATO would have been one way to prevent that
outcome from threatening Eastern Europe. That, after all, was the
reasoning behind bringing West Germany into NATO following World War Two
and a unifed Germany into NATO following the Cold War.

Declassifed US documents demonstrate that [[Russian leaders desired a
post-Cold War]{.mark} European [order]{.mark} [that would include
the]{.mark}m]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and not as a mere adornment. This
vision underlay Mikhail [Gorbachev's]{.underline} 1989 [proposal to the
Council of Europe for restructuring Europe to create 'a common
home.']{.underline} Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian
leaders regarded NATO expansion and Russia's integration into a
pan-European security order as incompatible. As Yeltsin explained to
Clinton, even reform-minded politicians in Russia would regard NATO
expansion.

> as a sort of neo-isolation of our country in diametric opposition to
> its natural admission into the Euro-Atlantic space.... We have a
> diferent approach, one that leads to a pan-European security system,
> an approach predicated in collective (but not on the basis of bloc
> membership) actions.... Security must be indivisible and based on
> pan-European security structures (National Security Archive 1993).

Unsurprisingly, [Russian leaders regarded NATO enlargement not as a step
toward inclusiveness but rather as a repudiation of it]{.underline}.
James Collins, chargé d'afaires at the US embassy in Moscow and later
ambassador to Russia, wrote in a cable to Secretary of State Warren
Christopher in 1993---prior to the latter's visit to Moscow--- that the
[Russians had made clear their fear that NATO expansion would exclude
them and therefore strategically bifurcate Europe in a new manner. 'No
matter how nuanced,']{.underline} Collins noted, '[[if NATO
adopts]{.mark} a policy which envisions [expansion]{.mark}]{.underline}
into Central and Eastern Europe [without holding the door open to
Russia, [it would be]{.mark} universally [interpreted in Moscow as
directed against]{.mark}]{.underline} Russia and **[[Russia
alone]{.underline}]{.mark}**--- or "[Neo-Containment" as [Foreign
Minister]{.mark}]{.underline} \[Andrei\] [[Kozyrev]{.mark} recently
[suggested']{.mark}]{.underline} (National Security Archive 2000).

[[Russia's leaders made]{.mark} their [opposition]{.mark} to NATO
enlargement [unambiguous from **1991 onward**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 3
July of that same year, as the Soviet Union was unraveling, a senior
delegation from the Russian Federated Soviet Socialist Republic
(RSFSR)--- which, once the Soviet state dissolved, became the
independent Russian Federation---wrote in a memorandum to Boris Yeltsin,
who was then the RSFSR's president, that it had stressed to senior NATO
ofcials that '[expanding NATO would be seen negatively in the
USSR]{.underline} and the RSFSR' and that the alliance's secretary
general, Manfred Woerner, had assured his Russian interlocutors that he
and the NATO Council were opposed to expansion (National Security
Archive 1991). But as discussions about expansion nevertheless proceeded
within the alliance, Yeltsin made his objections clear during a December
1993 meeting with Woerner (Chicago Tribune 1993). In March 1995,
Yeltsin's foreign minister, Kozyrev, a liberal reformer whom Europe and
the USA considered a staunch advocate of partnership with the West,
remarked that 'whatever one may think of NATO, it's still a military
alliance that was created when Europe was divided.... It should be
replaced by a new model based on comprehensive security.' Kozyrev,
echoing Gorbachev, added archly that 'the gap between NATO's very active
moves to studying potential enlargement and its passive attitude in
developing this new model of comprehensive security is a very wide one,
and it could be dangerous' (quoted in Whitney 1995).

Later that year, Russian president [Boris Yeltsin]{.underline}, true to
form, [used blunter phraseology]{.underline}. In criticizing NATO's frst
major out-of-area endeavor, Operation Deliberate Force, which launched
airstrikes against Bosnian Serb redoubts as part of the efort to end
Bosnia's civil war, he called for a European (including Russia) solution
to the confict and wondered why Europeans allowed themselves 'to be
dictated to from beyond the ocean,' an obvious reference to the USA.
Turning to the broader NATO enlargement issue, he noted that '[when NATO
approaches the borders of the Russian Federation, you can say there will
be two military blocs,]{.underline} and [this will be a restoration of
what we already had']{.underline} (quoted in Erlanger 1995). Yeltsin
could be emotional and erratic, among other things, but [his assessment
proved prescient. By the end of Barack Obama's presidency, talk of a
'**new Cold War'** between Russia and the West had become
commonplace]{.underline}. Hopes for partnership had all but evaporated
(Legvold 2014, 2016).

True, when Kozyrev and Yeltsin made their remarks, Russia was part of
the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, established in 1991. Yet to
Russian leaders this forum and others that it later became part of, such
as the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council and the Partnership for Peace,
were scant recompense for NATO's advance toward its borders, which from
the outset they deemed a threat to their country's security. A 1993
report by Evgenii Primakov, the head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence
Service, who would succeed Kozyrev as Foreign Minister 3 years later,
warned that 'a stereotypical bloc mentality' persisted in the West,
which still regarded Russia as a threat. He noted that though NATO's
leaders might not intend to exclude and isolate Russia, the country
should nevertheless anticipate a future in which the alliance's 'zone of
responsibility...reache\[d\] the borders of the Russian Federation.'
Primakov opined that although that outcome would not result in creation
of 'a bridgehead to strike Russia or its allies,' this did not mean that
NATO's eastward expansion would 'not afect Russia's military security
interests.' NATO was the world's 'biggest military grouping,' and its
movement toward Russia's borders would, in his assessment, necessitate
'a fundamental reappraisal' of Russia's defense doctrine and posture'
(Izvestiia 1992).

[[Russia]{.underline} [did not beef up]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
[military units]{.mark}]{.underline} deployed on its western fank, [[but
that does not establish]{.mark} that [its leaders regarded NATO
expansion as unthreatenin]{.mark}]{.underline}[g]{.mark}. For one thing,
[[they made **abundantly clear**]{.mark} that [they did see it as
such]{.mark}, and one would have to dismiss all of their protestations
as propaganda in order to conclude that they were merely engaged in
theatrics]{.underline}. In addition, [Russia's economic free fall in the
1990s]{.underline}, coupled with the continuing necessity to deploy
forces along a vast frontier that abutted 16 countries, [rendered a
countervailing military response infeasible. Russia's]{.underline}
leaders held a [weak hand]{.underline}, but that only served to
[increase their resentment over what they regarded as the West's
**disregard for their legitimate security interests**.]{.underline}
Their bitterness was not contrived. Consider Sandy Berger's
characterization of President Clinton's response to Yeltsin's objections
at the 1996 Helsinki summit: 'Give it up on NATO enlargement.... We're
going ahead; stop rocking it. All you're doing Boris is creating a
defeat for yourself.' When Yeltsin sought to salvage something by asking
that the Baltic states not be inducted into NATO, Clinton's answer, as
characterized by Berger was 'No, I will not make that commitment.... All
you are doing is moving the line of the divide between East and
West...farther to the east' (Berger 2005).

**NATO made Russia into a revisionist power by backing them into a
corner.**

Vladimir Putin is a brutal autocrat and the Kremlin's actions in Ukraine
undoubtedly constitute a gross violation of international law. However,
the popular characterisation of Putin's grand strategy as imperialist is
erroneous. [Russia's primary foreign policy objective regarding the
Ukraine has been to prevent the country joining the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO),]{.underline} the world's most formidable
military alliance, [which Russia justifiably regards as dire threat to
its security]{.underline}. In a Foreign Affairs article entitled, "Why
the Ukraine Crisis is the West's Fault", John Mearsheimer explains that
"\[[Russian leaders\] would not stand by while their strategically
important neighbour turned into a Western bastion]{.underline}."\[5\]
Within the Australian media, Tom Switzer has been a rare voice of
thoughtful moderation on Russia, observing that [Putin has been,
"protecting legitimate security interests", and that his, "**objectives
are limited**."]{.underline}\[6\]

It is vitally important that the West understands that [[Russia's
conduct]{.mark} in the Ukraine [is a]{.mark} rational [response
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the [strategic pressure]{.underline} that has
been [placed on the country by an encroaching military alliance,
[NATO]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [[Kremlin]{.mark}'s foreign policies
[conform to]{.mark} the expectations of **[defensive
realism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [A defensive realist foreign policy
prioritises state security]{.underline}, which is maximised when a
stable balance of power is established in the international system.\[7\]
[Defensive realists advise against imperialism and
aggression]{.underline}, but they do advocate power projection by
threatened states to the extent that is necessary to restore the
international system to a stable state of equilibrium.\[8\] As Robert
Person argues, [Putin has been pursuing a defensive realist strategy
because his, "ultimate objective is to maximize his security, not his
power."\[]{.underline}9\] NATO's hubristic expansion has destroyed the
balance of power that existed in Europe during the Cold War and
engendered feelings of insecurity and vulnerability in the minds of
Russia's leaders. These attitudes are rooted in a rational conception of
the international as a realm in which the threat of war is constant and
each state must take responsibility for its own survival.

To say this is not to condone the Kremlin's actions in Ukraine on an
ethical level. But the righteous condemnations of Russia in the Western
media have only served to obscure the origins of the Ukraine crisis and
potential strategies for mediating it. If peace and stability are to be
re-established in Eastern Europe, then it is vital that we look past the
scaremongering and hyperbole, and re-examine the origins of Russia-NATO
antagonism.

New Russia, Same Old NATO Mentality: A Lost Opportunity for Détente

NATO was founded in 1948 to balance the power of the USSR and its
communist allies in Eastern Europe. The organisation's founding members
were the United States (US), Canada and ten Western European nations.
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, it seemed that the
nascent Russian state would soon be integrated into the US-led world
order. NATO appeared obsolete and some predicted that it would be
disbanded.\[10\] So how did we get to a situation where Russia and NATO
are once again at loggerheads?

To understand the re-emergence of NATO-Russia antipathy, we have to
return to the final years of the Soviet Union and a meeting between
Mikhail Gorbachev and then US Secretary of State, James Baker. On
February 9, 1990 in the Kremlin's St. Catherine's Hall, Gorbachev made a
stunning concession to Baker, agreeing to allow East Germany's
incorporation into NATO. \[11\] The Soviet leader pledged to withdraw
380,000 troops from East Germany and approved the reunified,
remilitarised Germany's incorporation into a hostile military alliance.
In return for his cooperation, Baker promised Gorbachev that, "there
would be no extension of NATO's jurisdiction for forces of NATO one inch
to the east."\[12\] But by 1993, the Clinton administration had already
embarked on plans to renege on Baker's promise and extend NATO
membership to Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic.\[13\] Whilst
Baker's promise was not legally binding, NATO's willingness to disregard
Russia's preferences and take advantage of the country's weakness would
set the tone for future interactions between the two entities.

In 1994, Russia began trying to marginalise NATO by promoting the
Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)\[14\] as the
continent's preeminent collective security body. Russia pushed for the
deployment of CSCE peacekeepers within the post-Communist world and even
allowed a CSCE force to be sent into Chechnya in 1995.\[15\] Though
these actions did to an extent empower the CSCE, the organisation soon
became subordinated to NATO when addressing large-scale issues of
European security.

During the latter stages of the Bosnian War in 1994-5, NATO carried out
airstrikes against Russia's allies, the Serbs, in spite of Russian
protestations.\[16\] At the conclusion of the conflict, NATO insisted
that it, rather than the UN, be charged with the implementation of the
Dayton Accords. In 1999, NATO again intervened in Serbia, bombing the
country for 78 days until Belgrade was forced to grant de facto
independence to Kosovo.\[17\] NATO's war, which it dubiously justified
as a humanitarian intervention, undoubtedly had much more to do with
asserting the alliance's preeminence in Eastern Europe than assisting
Serbia's oppressed Kosovar Albanian minority.\[18\] NATO's wanton use of
force so close to Russia's border alarmed the Kremlin, with Russia's
Foreign minister Igor Ivanov warning NATO's actions risked ushering in a
new Cold War.\[19\]

In 1999, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland were also incorporated
into NATO, as the alliance moved ahead with plans to admit the Baltic
states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.\[20\] Whilst NATO has justified
its expansion as a means for promoting freedom, democracy and human
rights,\[21\] the alliance's enlargement had the effect of entrenching a
formidable Western military presence in Central Europe.

Realising that NATO enlargement would antagonise Russia, the
distinguished American diplomat **[George Kennan opposed the strategy
from the beginning]{.underline}**. As the chief architect of the
Marshall Plan and one of [[the original advocate]{.mark}s [for]{.mark}
US [containment]{.mark} of the Soviet Union in the immediate aftermath
of WWII, [Kennan]{.mark} was nothing if not tough on
Russia]{.underline}.\[22\] [But in 1997 he [wrote "expanding NATO
would]{.mark} be the most fateful error of American policy in the post
cold-war era]{.underline}"\[23\] [such a move might ["impel Russian
foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our
liking.]{.mark}"\[]{.underline}24\] In a prescient 1998 interview Kennan
explained [that such a decision "shows so little understanding of
Russian history and Soviet history. Of course there is going to be a bad
reaction from Russia, and then \[the NATO expanders\] will say that we
always told you that is how the Russians are -- but this is just
wrong."\[]{.underline}25\]

The Arrival of Putin: Conciliation Fails Amid NATO Provocations

When Vladimir **[Putin came to power in January 2000]{.underline}**,
relations between Russia and NATO were at a very low ebb. Yet far from
exhibiting any anti-Western tendencies, [[Putin initially
attempted]{.mark} to facilitate [rapprochement]{.mark} between Russia
and the West. Putin characterised NATO as a minimal threat to Russia's
security, and even went as far as to suggest that Russia may still
consider joining the alliance in the right
circumstances]{.underline}.\[26\] NATO responded with a conciliatory
gesture of its own, establishing the NATO-Russia Council in November
2001.\[27\] However, Putin's overtures failed to dampen the alliance's
expansionist zeal.

[[From 2003 to 2005 the West extended its influence]{.mark} further
[into Eastern Europe]{.mark}]{.underline} by aiding revolutions against
pro-Russian regimes in Georgia and the Ukraine. Between 1993 and 2003,
\$700 million in US aid and \$420 million European Union (EU) aid was
directed into Georgia.\[28\] Most of this money was channeled through
Western NGOs and was used toward electoral and judicial reform and
citizen mobilisation.

Vote rigging by Georgia's pro-Russian government in 2003 sparked
widespread protests against the incumbent President Eduard Shevardnadze.
Western NGOs played a key role in financing opposition parties and
organising demonstrations.\[29\] When popular pressure forced
Shevardnadze to resign, he was succeeded by the pro-NATO Mikhail
Saakashvili. [Voter fraud orchestrated by the Ukraine's pro-Russian
President, Victor Yanukovich, in 2004 sparked similar protests in the
Ukraine. Again, state-funded Western NGOs played a central role in
mobilising anti-government demonstrators]{.underline}. Protestors were
entertained with rock music, provided with free food and tent
accommodation and even paid small amounts of money for attending
rallies.\[30\] When popular pressure prompted Ukraine's Supreme Court to
annul the election result and order a revote, the Western-backed Victor
Yushchenko was elected President.

[[In]{.mark} March [2004 NATO accepted]{.mark} seven new member states
including the three [Baltic]{.mark} [states.]{.mark} For the first time,
NATO was right [on Russia's border]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[31\] Twelve
hundred miles had separated Saint Petersburg from NATO during the Cold
War, but that distance had been reduced to less than one hundred miles.
Later that year [Georgia and the Ukraine signed Individual Partnership
Action Plans, and joint NATO-Ukraine military exercises in Crimea soon
followed]{.underline}.\[32\]

Whilst Putin downplayed the importance of these events, others in his
administration expressed much alarm. [Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov
warned "we cannot, of course, watch impartially the military structure
of the alliance moving ever closer to our borders."\[]{.underline}33\]
[It was quite reasonable for the Kremlin to view NATO's incorporation of
the Baltic States as an outright threat.]{.underline} Unlike the
existing NATO members and former Warsaw Pact states, the 1990
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty, which was designed to
prevent any country from amassing the weaponry required to launch an
offensive war, didn't bind the Baltic nations.\[34\] [NATO now held the
legal right to deploy an unlimited quantity of troops and military
hardware in the Baltic.]{.underline}\[35\] Plans were made for the
Baltic states to accede to an adapted CFE treaty, but a series of
diplomatic stalemates resulted in the US and its NATO allies refusing to
ratify the new agreement.\[36\]

[[In 2007,]{.mark} the [Bush]{.mark} Administration [announced]{.mark}
plans to construct [a missile defence shield]{.mark} in Eastern
Europe]{.underline}.\[37\] The pretext for this decision was that it was
necessary to protect Europe from an Iranian nuclear attack. However,
[Moscow quickly realised that the shield would have the potential to
undermine and perhaps even neutralise Russia's nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}. Putin suggested an alternative, namely the
construction of a joint Russia-US radar warning system in Azerbaijan,
but the US rejected this proposal.\[38\] At this point, **[[Putin was
forced to abandon his conciliatory approach]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In
his 2007 State of the Nation Address, the [Russian President
characterised NATO as, "a real threat".\[]{.underline}39\] Russia
formally suspended its observance of its CFE treaty obligations a month
later.

At a summit in Bucharest [[in]{.mark} April [2008, NATO released a
statement affirming]{.mark} that [Georgia and]{.mark} the
[Ukraine]{.mark} would be offered
[membership]{.mark}.]{.underline}\[40\] US pressure was the chief driver
of this decision, as several Western European alliance members expressed
opposition to the plan.\[41\]

[[This was NATO's most threatening]{.mark} and provocative [move]{.mark}
towards Russia yet. [Ukraine]{.mark}, as the biggest country is Europe,
[constitutes an important]{.mark} strategic [buffer]{.mark} between
Russia and NATO. Napoleonic [France,]{.mark} Wilhelmine Germany,
[and]{.mark} Nazi [Germany]{.mark} all [invaded Russia through
southeast]{.mark}ern [Europe]{.mark}]{.underline} and consequently, [the
Kremlin is extremely reticent to allow the armies of those countries to
once again be stationed there]{.underline}. Georgia borders Russia's
volatile Caucasus region, already rife with minority nationalism and
secessionist sentiment. Furthermore, [both Georgia and the Ukraine are
proximate to Russia's Volga region, its agricultural heartland and its
access point for Caspian Sea oil. The Kremlin cannot and will not risk
its control over these assets being compromised.]{.underline}

The Fight over Georgia and the Ukraine: Russia's Militarist Turn

It was only a matter of time before tension between Russia and NATO over
the status of Georgia and the Ukraine spilled over into conflict. After
winning wars of secession against Georgia in the early 1990s, the
breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia had enjoyed de facto
independence from Tbilisi.\[42\] Both had been reliant on Russia for
strategic and financial support, though Russia still formally recognised
them as part of Georgia. In May of 2008, when Georgian President Mikhail
Saakashvili requested that Russian peacekeepers in Abkhazia be withdrawn
and replaced by either EU or NATO forces, Russia responded by increasing
the size of its force.\[43\] In June, Georgia detained Russian
peacekeepers stationed in Abkhazia. Then on August 7 Georgia launched an
attack on South Ossetia, killing numerous civilians and 12 Russian
soldiers.\[44\] A day later, Russia sent ground troops into the
secessionist territories and began bombing Georgian military and
industrial targets. After five days of fighting, Moscow forced Tbilisi
to agree to a ceasefire on Russian terms. Russia formally recognised the
two breakaway polities as sovereign nations and announced that a force
of 7,600 would remain in the territories indefinitely for their
"protection".\[45\]

Russia's strong-arming of Georgia was the Kremlin's way of signaling to
NATO that it would not tolerate any further expansion of the alliance.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev evoked a siege mentality, stating
that "we do not have any illusion of partnership \[with NATO\]...
Naturally we are not happy with being surrounded by military
bases."\[46\]

Russia's war succeeded, as NATO's plans to extend membership to Georgia
were put on an indefinite hold. The alliance could hardly incorporate
Georgia when Tbilisi had no sovereignty over 20 percent of its
territory. Nonetheless, the West continued to put geostrategic pressure
on Russia. NATO suspended the Russia-NATO Council, established a
permanent military presence in the Baltic and, in December 2009, refused
a Russian proposal to replace the CFE treaty.\[47\] In 2010 the US
relocated a Patriot missile battery from Germany to Poland and, in 2012,
opened phase one of its European Missile Defence Shield.\[48\]

With tensions high and the issue of Ukraine's NATO membership still
unresolved, another conflict always seemed likely. Ukrainian society is
deeply divided between pro-Russian and pro-Western segments, and voting
in the country tends to follow this division.\[49\] The Westernisation
of Ukraine had been stalled by the election of the pro-Russian Victor
Yanukovich in 2010. On 25 November 2013, Yanukovich delayed his decision
to sign an Association Agreement with the EU which would have forced the
Ukraine to sever all economic ties with Russia. Instead, Yanukovich
signed a deal with Russia whereby the Kremlin would buy \$15 billion of
Ukrainian bonds and cut its gas prices to the country by one
third.\[50\] This decision angered pro-Western Ukrainians, who took to
the streets in protest.

As civil unrest grew, police began to crack down violently on
demonstrators.\[51\] On the 21 February 2014, after three months of
protests, Yanukovich fled to Russia and, in what can only be described
as a coup, a new pro-Western government took power in Kiev.\[52\] The
full extent of US involvement in the coup is at this stage unknown, but
a leaked conversation between US assistant secretary of state for
European and Eurasian affairs Victoria Nuland and US Ambassador to the
Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt suggests it could have been substantial. During
the conversation, Nuland expressed her support for regime change in
Ukraine and her desire to see Arseniy Yatsenyuk become the country's new
Prime Minister -- which he did.\[53\]

Russian troops moved into the Crimean Peninsular on 22 February. Putin
chose to take Crimea primarily because it contains the strategically
important Black Sea port of Sevastopol, which Russia had been leasing
from the Ukraine since the end of the Cold War.\[54\] The annexation of
Crimea was a warning that Moscow would not tolerate the Ukraine slipping
out of its orbit. On the day of the Crimean annexation, Putin warned
NATO not to "make itself at home in our backyard or in our historical
territory."\[55\] Russia then orchestrated a proxy war in Eastern
Ukraine, arming pro-Russian rebels and probably also deploying several
hundred Special Forces soldiers in Eastern Ukraine to aid them.\[56\] In
May, Ukraine elected a pro-Western government that renounced the
country's non-aligned status and signaled its desire to join NATO.\[57\]

Russia's militarist tactics were once again successful in stalling
NATO's advance. In March 2016, European Commission President Jean-Claude
Juncker affirmed that the Ukraine would not gain NATO membership within
the next two decades.\[58\] However, since 2014, NATO and the Ukraine
have conducted numerous joint military exercises and NATO has committed
\$5.4 million to assist with the modernisation of Ukraine's army.\[59\]
The alliance has also increased its troop presence in the Baltic and
conducted a military parade in Estonia less than a kilometer from
Russian territory.\[60\] In 2016, the US completed phase two of its
missile defence shield, opening a weapons system in Romania and
announcing that a similar system will be opened in Poland in 2018.\[61\]
Russia, meanwhile, has ensured that Eastern Ukraine remains in a state
of frozen conflict and has effectively consolidated its control over
South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\[62\]

Russia and NATO: Where to Next?

Winston Churchill once famously remarked that Russia is, "a riddle
wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma."\[63\] However, [since the end of
the Cold War at least, the Russian mindset has been remarkably easy to
understand.]{.underline}

[[Russia regards NATO]{.mark}, the world's most powerful military
alliance, [as a dire threat]{.mark} the its security. [Russia's
goal]{.mark} of trying to halt NATO's eastward march is [rooted in a
**defensive realist view**]{.mark} of international politics. The
[Kremlin is attempting to safeguard]{.mark} its [security]{.mark}; it is
[not]{.mark} looking to [reclaim]{.mark} lost status or recapture an
[empire]{.mark}.]{.underline} Analysts such as Derk Eppink have
contended that, "Putin's mind-set is largely rooted in the 19th century.
Politics \[for him\] is about power."\[64\] [Those who dismiss this
worldview as outdated would do well to remember that [Russia was almost
destroyed twice]{.mark} in twentieth century [by invasions through
Eastern Europe.]{.mark} At least [twenty-seven million Russians were
killed during WWII]{.mark}, roughly one third of the war's overall death
toll]{.underline}.\[65\] [[It should hardly be surprising]{.mark} that a
sense of [vulnerability still pervades Russian]{.mark} strategic
[thinking]{.mark} today.]{.underline}

**Russia is not an expansionist power -- but they do want a limited
sphere of influence.**

**Carpenter**, Ted Galen, PhD, **'19**, NATO: The Dangerous Dinosaur.
Cato Institute. P 73-79.

[[Those who contend]{.underline}]{.mark} that Russia's annexation of
[[Crimea]{.mark} in 2014 [proves that the Putin government is
pursuing]{.mark} an aggressive]{.underline}, [[expansionist foreign
policy are **misreading the situation**]{.underline}. [Crimea was a
**special case**]{.underline}]{.mark} for several reasons. First, the
peninsula had been part of Russia between 1783 and 1954, during both the
czarist and Soviet eras. Soviet leader [Nikita [Khrushchev]{.mark}, for
reasons that are not entirely clear, [arbitrarily transferred Crimea to
Ukraine]{.mark} in 1954. Since Ukraine and Russia were both part of the
Soviet Union, that decision didn't seem to matter much at the time.
[When the Soviet Union dissolved]{.mark} at the end of 1991, however,
[Russia]{.mark} suddenly [faced the reality that its key naval base at
Sevastopol now was]{.mark} on the territory of a [foreign]{.mark}
country]{.underline}. Yet even that development didn't seem to alarm
Russian officials, since Ukraine's government remained in the hands of
generally pro-Russian political leaders throughout the 1990s and the
early years of the new millennium. Kiev provided further reassurance by
granting Russia a 25-year lease on the facility shortly after gaining
independence.

[The situation became problematic,]{.underline} though,
[when]{.underline} Viktor [Yushchenko, an anti-Russian, pro-Western
figure, became Ukraine's president in 2004]{.underline}, leading the
so-called Orange Revolution. Russian officials were noticeably nervous
when Yushchenko indicated a renewal was unlikely when Moscow's lease at
Sevastopol expired in 2017. That danger passed, however, once another
pro-Russian politician, Viktor Yanukovych, won Ukraine's 2010
presidential election. Moscow's anxiety then receded.

Those worries resurfaced with a vengeance in 2014, though, when
antiYanukovych demonstrators, encouraged if not actively aided by
Washington and the European Union, overthrew the Ukrainian president
nearly two years before his term expired.28 Extremely nationalist,
anti-Russian factions dominated the regime that emerged from the Maidan
Revolution. Not only did the Crimean naval base now seem in jeopardy,
but the new leaders avidly sought NATO membership for
Ukraine---something that Washington had pushed for years.

The Kremlin responded quickly and decisively to the Ukraine
developments. Barely disguised Russian special forces reinforced the
normal garrison at Sevastopol and set up positions elsewhere on the
peninsula. Pro-Russian political figures in Crimea immediately called
for a referendum on secession from Ukraine, which was held days later
and produced a predictably affirmative vote. Newly elected Crimean
officials then asked that their territory be allowed to join the Russian
Federation---a "request" that Moscow quickly granted.

U.S. anger at such a transparent territorial grab was volcanic. The
Obama administration denounced the move, and Washington imposed an array
of economic sanctions on Russia. The administration also induced and
pressured its European allies to do the same. Such a response
constituted an overreaction, and a hypocritical one. Much of the blame
for the Crimea episode should be put at Washington's door. The U.S.-EU
meddling in Ukraine's politics to encourage the ouster of a pro-Russian
government---a democratically elected one at that---could hardly be seen
as other than hostile and threatening to both Russian leaders and the
Russian public. Indeed, polls indicated that Putin's approval rating
soared to over 80 percent following the annexation.29

The Crimea issue became the principal grievance that anti-Russia types
in the United States cited to justify a confrontational policy---until
the allegations of Russian interference in U.S. elections eclipsed that
complaint. But one might ask why so many U.S. political leaders and
policymakers elevated a parochial territorial dispute to such
prominence, much less why they insist that the arbitrary edict made back
in 1954 by the communist dictator of a defunct country must be treated
with reverence.30

It would have been better if the successor republics collectively had
addressed and implemented territorial adjustments involving Crimea and
other potential problem areas when the USSR dissolved, but Moscow's
decision to resolve the Crimea question unilaterally was not necessarily
a sign of broader territorial ambitions.

[The [conquest is not even unprecedented]{.mark} in the post--World War
II era. [Israel seized the Golan]{.mark} Heights]{.underline} from Syria
in 1967 during the Six-Day War and later annexed that territory.
[[Turkey seized]{.mark} a major portion of [Cyprus]{.mark}]{.underline}
and continues to occupy that land, establishing a puppet state as a
façade. It [is certainly an **overstatement** to contend]{.underline},
as does UCLA political science professor Daniel Treisman, that "By
annexing a neighboring country's territory by force, Putin overturned in
a single stroke the assumption on which the post--Cold War European
order had rested."31 [One could make a stronger case that [the
first]{.mark} major [blow to that post--Cold War]{.mark} European [order
came]{.mark} 15 years earlier [when]{.mark} the **[Western powers
amputated Kosovo]{.mark}** from Serbia]{.underline}.

Yet [Western opinion leaders routinely cite the Crimea annexation
and]{.underline} Moscow's subsequent assistance to secessionist factions
in eastern Ukraine as [proof that Russia has broad, perhaps even
unlimited, expansionist goals]{.underline}. In February 2015, Gen. Sir
Adrian Bradshaw, the senior British officer in NATO, asserted that
Russia's expansionism threatened to become an "obvious existential
threat to our whole being."32 The following year, Leon Panetta, the
former secretary of defense, expressed similar alarm. "Let's not kid
anybody," Panetta stated, "Putin's main interest is to try to restore
the old Soviet Union."33

When advocates of a confrontational policy toward Moscow were not
alleging that Putin wanted to revive the Soviet Union, they accused him
of seeking to restore the pre-Soviet Russian empire. That allegation
even predated the seizure of Crimea. Senator McCain made the accusation
in 2008, at the time of the Russo-Georgian war. "I think it's very clear
that Russian ambitions are to restore the old Russian Empire," McCain
stated. "Not the Soviet Union, but the Russian Empire."34

That line of argument at least implicitly acknowledged that Putin was
not a doctrinaire communist, but it still was misplaced and exaggerated.
As Harvard University professor Andrei Shleifer and his co-author Daniel
Treisman observe in Foreign Affairs, "[To many in the West, Russia's
2008 invasion of Georgia seemed to prove the Kremlin's land
hung]{.underline}er." Shleifer and Treisman argue that such a conclusion
reflects poor logic. "[Kremlin leaders bent on expansion would surely
have ordered troops all the way to Tbilisi to depose]{.underline}
\[Georgia President Mikheil\] Saakashvili. [At the least, Russian forces
would have taken control of the oil and gas pipelines that cross
Georgia." Instead, the Russians "left those pipelines alone and quickly
withdrew to the mountains]{.underline}."35

Shleifer and Treisman raise a very important point. [If [Putin is a
rogue leader with massive expansionist objectives]{.underline}]{.mark}[,
[why would he relinquish territory that Russian forces already
occupied?]{.mark}]{.underline} [In]{.mark}deed, with very little
additional effort, [those [forces could have captured]{.mark} Tbilisi
and [the rest of Georgia]{.mark}. Yet [Moscow did not attempt to do
so]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hitler never willingly gave up any of his
conquests. And until the East European satellite empire collapsed in
1989--1991, the USSR disgorged only one occupied area---the portion of
Austria it controlled at the end of World War II. Even that modest
retreat took place only after laborious, multiyear negotiations for a
treaty guaranteeing Austria's strict neutrality. If Putin truly harbors
malignant expansionist ambitions comparable to those of Hitler and
Stalin, declining to conquer and absorb all of Georgia when that
achievement was easily within reach is a curious step. [His [decision
merely to maintain]{.mark} and consolidate [Abkhazia and South
Ossetia]{.mark} as Russian protectorates [suggests much more
**restrained and limited ambitions**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

[Allegations that Putin wants to reconstitute the Soviet]{.underline} or
the czarist [empires are vastly overblown. Former NATO supreme
commander]{.underline} Gen. Philip M. [Breedlove is a little closer to
the mark when he contends that "[Moscow is determined to
reestablish]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[what it considers its rightful
sphere of influence]{.underline}**]{.mark}, undermine NATO, [and reclaim
its **great power status**]{.underline}."36 But wanting, indeed
[insisting [upon, a sphere of influence has long been standard behavior
for major powers]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, the United States
declared such a sphere when James Monroe's administration proclaimed the
Monroe Doctrine--- and it did so at a time when the country was still
far from attaining great power status. As for wishing to undermine NATO,
it is more accurate to say that [Moscow is belatedly trying to fend off
the alliance's seemingly inexorable advance east]{.underline}. Finally,
Russian leaders would presumably like to reclaim great power status for
their country; at the very least, [[they insist on a **seat at the
table** when]{.mark} major [decisions]{.mark} [about Eastern Europe, the
Middle East, and Central Asia are made]{.mark}]{.underline}. That
position is not unreasonable, and an especially clumsy aspect of Western
policy toward Moscow has been the unwillingness to accord even basic
respect to Russia and not trample on its core interests.

In her address to the UN Security Council, U.S. Ambassador [Nikki Haley
blasted Moscow for "outlaw actions"]{.underline} and stated that the
latest "outrageous violation of sovereign Ukrainian territory is part of
a pattern of Russian behavior."47 Former CIA station chief Daniel
Hoffman asserted, "Containment and deterrence are vestiges of the Cold
War, which effectively countered the Soviet Union. They are similarly
applicable today because Putin---the KGB operative in the Kremlin
reviving the ethos of the Soviet evil empire---would best be countered
with a 21st-century version of President Reagan's 'peace through
strength' strategy. Ukraine is on the front lines of defense against
Russia's pernicious espionage, military, cyber and economic attacks. The
time is ripe for U.S. leadership, and Ukraine's sovereignty is where we
should draw and enforce a red line."48 [One could scarcely imagine a
more blatant and **simplistic attempt** to equate today's Russia with
the totalitarian and messianic expansionist Soviet Union]{.underline}.
Hoffman's proposal to "draw and enforce a red line" to protect Ukraine
also would erase any meaningful distinction between Washington's
security obligations to NATO members and European nonmembers. Kiev would
have an Article 5 guarantee in all but name, and that would be an
appallingly reckless, provocative step. A scholar for the staunchly
pro-NATO Atlantic Council seemed to embrace reasoning similar to
Hoffman's, speculating that [although the alliance probably would not
send combat units to defend Ukraine in response to further Russian
encroachments, it might well dispatch "military advisers" to assist
Kiev's forces]{.underline}.49 [The role of such American "advisers" in
Vietnam, Syria, Yemen, and other arenas [suggests]{.mark} just how
perilous such a move might be]{.underline}. The [angry Western [response
to Russia's behavior in]{.mark} and around [Crimea]{.mark}]{.underline}
over the past five years [[is **overdone**.]{.underline}50]{.mark}
[Because of its size, geographic position, and both economic and
strategic importance]{.underline}, [[Ukraine occupies a special position
in Moscow's]{.mark} geopolitical [calculations]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Russian leaders are]{.mark} [even more concerned about the prospect of
Ukraine becoming a NATO outpost]{.mark} than they are about Georgia
doing so]{.underline}. **[[Other portions of the Soviet Union's former
domain do not generate the same level of worry or
determination]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Yet [desp[i]{.mark}te the
country's critical importance, [there is **little evidence**]{.mark}
that the [Putin regime seeks to reabsorb Ukraine]{.mark} into a "Greater
Russia]{.underline}." [Russian leaders]{.underline} likely [understand
the difficulty of trying to rule directly a seething
Ukraine]{.underline}---or even control it indirectly by installing a
puppet government. The idea would soon evoke memories of the USSR's
unhappy experiences in such places as Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and
Afghanistan.

[There is **[even less evidence]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [the Kremlin
has ambitions [to reincorporate the Baltic]{.mark} republics, [Finland,
or Poland]{.mark},]{.underline} although they were also part of the
czarist empire. Ru[ssian claims to Crimea were much stronger than claims
to any of those states, and the strategic motivations were stronger
too]{.underline}---especially after the Western-backed Maidan
Revolution. The Russian government's actions regarding Crimea, even the
annexation, seem more likely a defensive (over)reaction to a flagrant
Western incursion into Russia's security space rather than the opening
salvo in a vast expansionist campaign. Hillary Clinton and others who
professed to see in Vladimir Putin's seizure of Crimea a repetition of
Hitler's moves in the late 1930s make an unwarranted, over-the-top
comparison.[51 [That interpretation of events is]{.mark} also a [false
rationale]{.mark} for preserving, much less expanding,
NATO.]{.underline}

[escalation]{.underline} from hardliners.**

One of the distinctive features of the modern Western political
narrative with regard to NATO is an almost total misunderstanding of how
the alliance is perceived in Russia. First and foremost, [the Western
political establishment seems blithely unaware of the fact that the
issue of NATO is the main stumbling block in Russian-Western relations,
and that **any detente is impossible** while that obstacle remains
unresolved. **[In Russia, NATO is]{.mark}** generally **[viewed
as]{.mark} part of the American war machine and [an instrument of
U.S.]{.mark} global [dominance]{.mark}**. That view is shared by almost
the entire Russian political spectrum]{.underline}. In fact, the same
view also prevails among NATO members from eastern Europe, where the
alliance is seen as an instrument of U.S. influence and U.S. defense
assurances. That is why [Russia is utterly baffled by U.S. accusations
that the Kremlin]{.underline} --- and President Vladimir Putin
specifically --- [are trying to "drive a wedge between NATO partners."
**[No one in Moscow has ever regarded NATO as]{.mark} an independent
entity that exists [separate]{.mark}ly [from the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates**. There is a [deep conviction]{.mark} in Russia that
NATO is nothing more than an **instrument of U.S. military policy**, and
that **[Washington will always be able to ram any decision
through]{.mark} the [NATO]{.mark} governing bodies**]{.underline},
regardless of what its Western European partners might think of that
decision. [That explains why any [NATO enlargement is]{.mark}
automatically [regarded in Russia as a **ruse to deploy U.S.
forces**]{.mark} in [close]{.mark} proximity [to Russian
borders]{.mark}]{.underline}; NATO's own role in that ruse is seen as a
cover story --- nothing more. [The]{.underline} ongoing [deployment of
NATO [forces in eastern Europe]{.mark} with the ostensible purpose of
"containing and deterring Moscow" is seen in Russia as another piece of
evidence to [confirm]{.mark} that view.]{.underline} These new
**[[deployments are conducted under direct U.S.
leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and most of the new forces deployed
are American. [The military presence of other NATO members in places
such as the Baltic states is **insignificant and purely
symbolic**.]{.underline} Washington and NATO describe these deployments
as a "clear signal to Moscow." In Moscow itself, that signal is read as
clear evidence that all the Russian criticisms and concerns about NATO
have always been entirely justified, and that the moderate Russian
reaction to NATO's enlargement in the 1990s and early 2000s was a
colossal strategic blunder. The Russian hawks have always insisted that
the only reason for admitting the Baltic states to NATO was to give the
United States a new forward-staging post for military deployment against
Russia. It now turns out that the hawks were right all along. That is
why [[Russia]{.mark} is now determined not to make the same mistake
again; **it [will do all it can to prevent]{.mark} any [further]{.mark}
NATO [encroachment]{.mark}**]{.underline} into former Soviet territory
--- namely, into Ukraine and Georgia. [[It's]{.mark} only [a matter of
time until this unspoken "red line]{.mark}" drawn by Moscow
[becomes]{.mark}]{.underline} an [[official]{.underline}]{.mark} stance.
The West does not realize that [Russia views NATO enlargement as a
threat of U.S. forces]{.underline} (potentially including missile
systems) [deployed ever closer to critical Russian targets.]{.underline}
As a result, Western decision-makers underestimate the strength of the
Russian national consensus on this issue. [There is a popular opinion in
the West that Russia opposes NATO only because of]{.underline} President
[Putin's personal animus. That opinion is a **gross and primitive
misreading of the situation**.]{.underline}

Pursuing Status

What these [[dominant]{.mark} **IR [paradigms]{.mark}**]{.underline}
have **[[missed]{.underline}]{.mark}** is [[the]{.mark} **pivotal
[importance]{.mark}** [of **status**]{.mark} **to Russia**]{.underline}.
[Status is the collective belief]{.underline} held by states and
statesmen [about a country's ranking in the international
hierarchy]{.underline} based on valued attributes, such as military
capabilities, economic wealth, culture, and socio-political
organization. Most studies of status focus on its social and
psychological dimensions. [States want to improve]{.underline} their
[status because of its integral importance to individuals' and groups'
sense of identity and self-esteem]{.underline}. But states also pursue
status because it has instrumental value. It is the "currency" of
international relations; when a state has status, it does not have to
use its material resources to get what it wants.

[**[Status concerns]{.mark}** have [played a **pivotal role** in]{.mark}
**Russian foreign [policymaking]{.mark}** throughout the **post-Soviet
period**]{.underline}. [Under]{.underline} its first post-Communist
foreign minister, Andrey [Kozyrev, Russia pursued democratic and liberal
reforms not only because it would improve]{.underline} the [material
wellbeing]{.underline} of its people, [but]{.underline} also
[because]{.underline} its [leaders believed Russia would be allowed to
take its rightful place alongside the democratic and liberal powers of
the West]{.underline}. [When this strategy of **status
seeking**]{.underline} [through social mobility failed, Russia,
under]{.underline} the stewardship of Yevgeny [Primakov]{.underline},
former foreign minister and prime minister, [sought to increase its
status through limited geopolitical competition]{.underline} with the
West. However, it was still too weak to counter U.S. power effectively.
Its efforts to do so, such as Primakov's attempts to form a strategic
triangle with China and India to balance the United States, or the hasty
decision to dispatch Russian paratroops to Kosovo to beat out the
arrival of NATO peacekeepers in 1999, yielded few results, making Russia
look impotent, incompetent, and out of touch with reality.

Russia abandoned these seemingly quixotic policies during Putin' first
two terms and again tried to find its place in the U.S.-led order. This
time not by transforming itself into a model liberal democratic state
but by establishing itself as a valuable partner for the United States
in the post-9/11 "War on Terror" and by using its natural resource
wealth to modernize its economy and emerge as an energy super power.
Neither of these aspirations came to fruition. [[The]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[**[did not]{.underline}** [accept Russia as an **equal
partner**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and it continued to pursue
policies]{.underline}, such as NATO enlargement, [that **led to further
status losses for Moscow**]{.underline}. Russia's resource-led growth
model exhausted itself domestically and was undermined by larger changes
to world energy markets.

[**[As a result]{.underline}**, [Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} [has again
**[turned toward]{.mark} geopolitical [competition]{.mark}** with
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. U.S.
relative decline and Russia's limited recovery from the Soviet collapse
make this strategy more effective this time around. [Moscow can leverage
its still formidable military, diplomatic, and espionage capabilities to
act as global spoiler to Washington]{.underline}. [[Russia's goal is
**not** to knock the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[off the top spot]{.mark} in the
global status hierarchy and assume this position for
itself]{.underline}. **[[Instead]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [Russia is
trying to [force the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[to
**recognize Russia's**]{.mark} **continued
[relevance]{.mark}**]{.underline} and get it to acquiesce to a "grand
bargain" on the international order that is more favorable to Russia's
status aspirations.

What IR liberals missed is that Russia could not join the liberal
international order on the terms that were acceptable to its leaders and
public. Russia would not only have to accept a subordinate role to the
more powerful United States, it would also have to accept a lower status
to Germany, Japan, and Great Britain, which are more advanced in other
attributes that are valued inside the liberal order such as democracy,
human rights, and economic liberalism. For their part, **[IR
[realists]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[failed]{.underline}** [to
recognize]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **[importance of
status]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and how it could push a **declining
power** such as Russia to pursue policies that are not commensurate with
its capabilities]{.underline}. [[Russia opposes NATO]{.mark} enlargement
[and ABM **not** because they are a threat]{.mark} to its security
**[but]{.mark}** because [they **undermine**]{.mark} **its
[status]{.mark}** as **regional hegemon** in the post-Soviet space and
nuclear equal of the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates.

[Status concerns are **particularly important** to **declining great
powers**]{.underline}, [such as Russia]{.underline} today or
Austria-Hungary in 1914. [These powers face the predicament of decline:
they have inherited a **large patrimony of interests**]{.underline} from
the times when they were great and powerful, [yet they have a declining
material capability to defend this patrimony]{.underline}. [They must
rely on status to defend]{.underline} their [interests and]{.underline}
thus [fiercely resist its decline]{.underline}.

[Russia is not the typical challenger]{.underline} envisioned by PT
theories. It **[is not]{.underline}** [trying to completely overturn the
order and replace it with governance structures of its own
design]{.underline}. [It is **more accurate**]{.underline} to
characterize [Russia as a "**reactionary challenger**]{.underline},"
using the term "reactionary" strictly in its definitional rather than
pejorative sense, as referring to a person or entity's preference for a
return to the status quo ante. In place of U.S. unipolar dominance,
Russia would like to see the return of multipolarity enshrined in a
Great Power Concert where the United States would have to share power
with other great powers. A Great Power Concert serves Moscow's status
aspirations in that it firmly entrenches Russia's position as one of the
leading states in the international system---even as its relative power
continues to decline.

Policies and Conclusions

How should the United States and its Western allies deal with a
declining challenger such as Russia? One seemingly rational policy might
be [[to ignore]{.mark} Russia]{.underline} for the time being and to
postpone the day of reckoning to the future, when Russia will be weaker.
This was the approach largely followed by the Obama administration.
However, it [**[provokes Russia]{.underline}**
[into]{.underline}]{.mark} [engaging in **even more [reckless and
destabilizing behavior]{.mark}** in order for it **to have its voice
heard**---as Obama soon found out in Ukraine and Syria]{.underline}.
**[[Containment]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the policy now [favored by many
Russia hawks in Washington, **[risks dangerous
confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} a
country that, despite its weaknesses, is still [[a **nuc**]{.mark}**lear
[superpower]{.mark}**]{.underline} with a formidable military. What's
more, **[[containment is unnecessary]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Russia's
leaders are **well aware** of the limits of their country's power and
are **not looking to overtake** the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [as the global hegemon
or to take over management of the international system]{.underline}.
[Accommodating Russia's status aspirations will **not embolden** it to
pursue more radical revisionism]{.underline}.

[**Instead of ignoring or containing Russia**, Western leaders must try
to find ways to **channel its status-seeking behavior** in
**constructive ways** that contribute to **global peace, stability, and
development**]{.underline}. Russia's efforts toward economic
reintegration of the post-Soviet space may have been such an
opportunity. From the very start, Russian leaders made it clear that
these efforts were not aimed at creating a closed neo-Soviet trade
block, but were designed to strengthen Russia's position in the larger
process of pan-European integration with the EU. Eurasian economic
integration could have contributed to the economic development and
stability of a problematic and dangerous region while also [allowing
Russia to improve its international status through peaceful and
constructive means]{.underline}. Instead of engaging with Russia's
regional integration efforts, the United States and the EU pushed back
against them, threatening Moscow with further status losses and
provoking (what should have been) a predictable backlash.

Other opportunities to engage Russia's status seeking in a constructive
way will present themselves in Syria, Ukraine, and in the geopolitical
realignments that China's rise will generate. They will confront Western
policy makers with difficult choices that will force them to find a
balance between their beliefs and values and the harsh realities of
power politics. In making these choices, they must understand just how
important status concerns are for Russia and realize that [the **bigger
dangers** come not from empowering a declining Russia through
accommodation, **but from ignoring its status aspirations or seeking to
constrain them**]{.underline}.

**Offense only goes one direction\-\--Russia only escalates in response
to [NATO provocation]{.underline}.**

And **[the Western alliance went even further]{.underline}**. In the
spring of 2009, the EU entered into an "Eastern Partnership" with six
former Soviet republics, for all practical purposes [forcing them to
choose between the West and Russia]{.underline}. Yet another
far-reaching step was [[NATO's decision to]{.mark} station Western
troops in former Soviet republics and Warsaw Pact countries, and to
include [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} -- which wasn't even a NATO member
-- **[step by step [into its military operations]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[In the eyes of the Kremlin leaders,]{.underline} [this was [evidence of
NATO's expansion]{.mark} to the East and the permanent deployment of
American troops in]{.underline}, for example, [Poland]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} began during the US presidency of Barack Obama
[**meant above all one thing: NATO was now only 200 kilometers away from
St. Petersburg.** This [could be dismissed as]{.mark}]{.underline} a bit
of [[paranoia]{.underline}]{.mark} on Russia's part, **[but [that would
do nothing to change Moscow's perception of the
situation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. From the Russian vantage point,
**[[the radical eastern expansion of NATO and the build-up of the
American missile defense]{.mark} shield in former Warsaw Pact states
[are]{.mark} [two links in a tangible chain of
escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For Putin and his team, [**these
moves [provided]{.mark} the [jumping-off point to]{.mark} break
international law, [annex Crimea and start a war in]{.mark} Eastern
[Ukraine.]{.mark}** [These actions revive an old image of
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, the archenemy of the West. [While [the
downfall of the Soviet Union]{.mark} meant that NATO had won the Cold
War, it also stripped the Atlantic Alliance of its **fundamental raison
d'etre**]{.underline}. But [since it simply clung to its treaties and
stuck to its adversarial concept, it had to keep the East]{.underline}
-- **[and everything associated with it -- alive]{.underline}**. The
fact that Vladimir Putin regularly nourished this image of the East as a
threating enemy, at least according to the West's interpretation, lent
it additional credence. Of equal consequence is **[the continuation of
America's supervisory control. The fact that US troops
remained]{.underline}** [-- at the express wish of the Europeans --
exactly where they were after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991
meant that]{.underline} **[no one in Washington had any reason to give
up or even modify their approach toward their junior partners on the
other side of the Atlantic.]{.underline}**

To begin with, [[there are a **number of reasons** to be
**sceptical**]{.underline}]{.mark} [about the 'revanchist Russia'
perspective]{.underline}. [First, [it adopts an **overly deterministic
position**]{.mark}, which negates the open-ended character of history by
underlining its predetermined course through certain 'iron laws' and the
supposedly unchanging 'essence' of Russia]{.underline}. In so doing,
[this]{.underline} perspective **[effectively denies]{.underline}** [the
role of]{.underline} individual [agency]{.underline}: [Whoever the
leader is, or whatever the regime may be, Russians are subordinate to
the quest for imperial greatness]{.underline}. This is a view that
incidentally dovetails with that of extreme Russian nationalists, who
see Russian history in similar holistic terms of a 'single stream' that
connects Ivan IV, Peter the Great, Stalin, and Putin. However,
[[Russia]{.mark} has [experienced]{.mark} **tremendous
[upheavals]{.mark}** throughout history [that **dramatically
changed**]{.mark} its society and its [relations]{.mark} with the
outside world]{.underline}. This happened often at the instigation of
one or a few individuals. Both the beginning and the end of the Soviet
Union, for example, serve as powerful reminders of the role agency plays
in affecting Moscow's internal and external affairs. Furthermore,
[essentialist claims about Russian identity do not offer much insight
into the dynamics of Moscow's approach to the liberal international
order, which has significantly fluctuated over time]{.underline}
(Tsygankov, 2016). Second, [Russia's revisionist behaviour should **not
be exaggerated**]{.underline}. [Its intervention in Ukraine has remained
**relatively limited**, as has its military activity in other
post-Soviet states]{.underline} (Götz, 2016, p. 9). In fact, the scope
of Russia's revanchist aims is a matter of debate. [It is **doubtful**
whether Moscow has a blueprint for an alternative international order
with different norms and principles than the current one]{.underline}.
[Nor does its promotion of conservative authoritarianism seem to
constitute a genuine agenda]{.underline}. As Lewis (2016) writes, 'the
export of conservative social and political values (...) has so far not
developed into a coherent campaign, but remains a rather ad hoc and
inchoate critique by Russian politicians of "multiculturalism", LGBT
rights and "political correctness" in Europe.' Furthermore,
[[the]{.mark} '**revanchist Russia' [perspective]{.mark}** [is
**unable** to account for the **numerous instances** in which
Moscow]{.mark} has **[adhered to]{.mark} the [norms, rules, and
institutions]{.mark}** that are associated [with the]{.mark} **existing
[liberal order]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While it might be a stretch to
describe [[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark} as a consistent defender of
multilateralism (Lo, 2015), it [[has **supported frameworks** such as
the]{.mark} 2015 **[Iran]{.mark} nuclear [deal]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[It]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[acceded to the]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[W]{.underline}]{.mark}**orld **[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**rade
**[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}**rganization in 2012 -- after 19 years of
talks -- [[and continues to be a member of the]{.mark}
**[E]{.mark}**uropean **[C]{.mark}**ourt of **[H]{.mark}**uman
**[R]{.mark}**ights]{.underline}. [[The **liberal goals**]{.mark} and
supranational methods of these institutions **[hardly fit with a
revisionist]{.mark} imperial [agenda]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Third,
[Moscow's behaviour is much more in line with that of an ordinary great
power than the 'revanchist Russia' perspective makes it out to
be]{.underline}. For one thing, Russia is by no means unique in its
quest to establish a zone of influence in its near neighbourhood. As
Carpenter (2017, January 19) points out, Russia is hardly the only
country to regard the \[sphere of influence\] concept as important for
its security. Or do U.S. officials believe that Chinese actions in the
South China Sea, Turkey's policies towards Iraq and Syria, and Saudi
Arabia's actions in Bahrain and Yemen do not involve such a
consideration? For another, interference in the domestic affairs of
other states is something of a habit for great powers. Whether they are
democratic or authoritarian does not seem to make a difference in this
regard. The United States, for example, has a long track record of
meddling in the internal affairs and electoral processes of other
countries (Levin, 2016). It is therefore unlikely that a more democratic
Russia will substantially change its key foreign policy objectives and
activities. Furthermore, the discrediting of Russian concerns over NATO
enlargement as an 'imagined' threat, rather than a 'real' one, misses
the mark. Any international relations scholar worth their salt knows
that uncertainty about others' intentions is central to security dilemma
dynamics. Thus, Moscow's fears should not be brushed aside as
idiosyncratic Russian paranoia. In conclusion, it seems fair to say that
[the 'revanchist Russia' perspective faces an array of explanatory
challenges and shortcomings]{.underline}.

Drawing from Russia's imperial conquests in the 16th through 19th
centuries as well as during the era of the Soviet Union, Russia has
developed an identity which includes the 'Little Russians' (Ukrainians),
the 'White Russians' (Byelorussians), and the 'Great Russians' (ethnic
Russians). Additionally, [due to their shared language Russia's identity
is also connected to many of the post-Soviet states and regions of
Central Asia.]{.underline} Russia's responsibility to this diverse group
of states and peoples is communicated through what Russia calls the
Russkiy Mir, or Russian world, meaning support for Russia's
"compatriots."33 This [[**Russian identity** applies to]{.mark} a
[significant amount of territory]{.mark} across two continents, which
directly [contributes to its]{.mark} **sense of [historical
insecurity]{.mark}**. Stephen Kotkin, a professor of history and
international affairs at Princeton University observed, "[Russia]{.mark}
has **[felt perennially vulnerable]{.mark} and [has]{.mark} often
[displayed]{.mark} a kind of [defensive
aggressiveness]{.mark}**\...Today, too, smaller countries on Russia's
borders are viewed less as potential friends than as potential
beachheads for enemies."]{.underline}34 This far-reaching concept of
vulnerability does not wholly originate from outside of Russia, [the
threat from within is widely understood by the current administration as
well.]{.underline} Russia's swift leadership changes have not always
been peaceful matters, and the prospect of regime change from within is
not lost on Putin or his inner circle. Gleb Pavlovsky, a former advisor
to Putin, observed that "In the Kremlin establishment, [ever since
Yeltsin's 1993 attack on the Parliament, there has been an absolute
conviction that as soon as the power centre shifts, or if there is mass
pressure, or the appearance of a popular leader, then everybody will be
annihilated. It's a **feeling of great vulnerability**]{.underline}."35
Therefore, [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates']{.underline} propensity
for seeking regime change in unstable states [is certainly **[perceived
as a threat across]{.mark} the [Russian leadership]{.mark}
establishment.**]{.underline} To this end, [the collapse of the Soviet
Union has been misinterpreted by the West, unlike the defeat of Nazi
Germany, Russia would not emerge as a completely different society open
to a transition towards Western liberalism.]{.underline} Rather, while
Russia did initially transition away from the authoritarian governments
of Leninism and adopt some liberal economic practices and institutions,
it did not escape the transition away from a top-heavy oligarchy capable
of monopolizing specific aspects of the country's economy and
government. This transition has been largely guided by ex-Chekist
Vladimir Putin, who in turn has sought to combine political, economic,
informational, and irregular warfare techniques, backed by conventional
military operations and a nuclear arsenal to challenge the West. In
doing so, [[Putin]{.mark} has [steered Russia back]{.mark}]{.underline}
into contention as a great power [[through a]{.mark} largely
opportunistic yet **[defensive approach]{.mark}** to foreign policy. [As
a substitute to NATO, Russia]{.mark} has **[pursued]{.mark} the
development of [regional security arrangements]{.mark} within its
perceived spheres of influence.**]{.underline} In November 1990,
twenty-two NATO and Warsaw Pact countries signed the Conventional Forces
in Europe Treaty (CFE) in Paris. That same day, those same nations and
their neutral neighbors adopted the Charter of Paris at the second
security summit of the Conference on Security and Cooperation (CSCE)
further linking security to democratic principles. [Russia encouraged
the elevation of the CSCE, with the goal of developing a
Eurasian-European institution that could **enhance cooperation with the
West**]{.underline}, while keeping Russia's interests and influence
intact throughout the region. CSCE was one of the few surviving
institutions of the Soviet Union. Created in 1970s during negotiations
between the Eastern and Western Blocs, the CSCE was born out of the 1975
Helsinki Final Act, which established shared principles, specifically
tying hard security with human rights, as well as reinforced territorial
integrity concepts. The CSCE would later be renamed as the Organization
on Security and Cooperation (OSCE), which simply replaced "Conference"
with "Organization." Russia's preference for the OSCE over NATO lies
with its veto power within the organization, which has granted it
significant weight in the decision. However, this veto power is one of
the larger reasons why the continuation of the OSCE was largely
unsuccessful in encouraging the United States' participation.

In many cases, the insecurity of states drives actions that are
perceived as revisionist, particularly actions taken by states that fear
a rival's advantage. Growing insecurity from a relative loss of power
places a state at a great disadvantage should war occur. [Military
build-ups of one state can cause a reduction in security for another in
two ways: first through the reduction in a state's ability to defend
itself, and second, through a belief in motives by 'convincing the
adversary that the state is inherently more dangerous that it had
previously believed']{.underline} (Glaser 1997, 178). [Both the [West
and Russia have **historical reasons to fear the**]{.mark} **actions of
the [other]{.mark}**, as much of modern history places the two sides at
odds]{.underline}, absent a brief, uneasy alliance against a revisionist
German power. The remainder of this article explores the U.S.--Russian
relationship in terms of the security dilemma, exploring the possibility
neither the West nor Moscow possesses aggressive intentions, but instead
they experience a security dilemma. [On one side, it is the West,
dominated by the American power and the NATO alliance of free democratic
states.]{.underline} Membership is simply the promotion of democracy,
viewed as an inherent good and intended to reduce state conflict by
making regimes answerable to the population. Led by the liberal hegemon,
the West simply wishes to promote freedom and international institutions
aimed at economic interdependence and peace. Georgia and Ukraine's
invitation to pursue NATO membership at the 2008 Bucharest Summit was
not an aggressive manoeuvre against Russia, but the promotion of this
peaceful alternative. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said of the
Summit, 'And that has had a significant impact on the nature of the
Alliance; it has had a significant impact on the Alliance's commitment,
dedication -- and intensive dedication -- to the cause of freedom' (Rice
2008). Alternatively, there is [[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
successor state to the former pole of the bygone bipolar era. It
[is]{.underline} a non-democratic state [[witnessing]{.mark} the [growth
of NATO]{.mark}, an organisation **[formed in hostility to its very
existence]{.mark}**. While the **Cold War is over**, NATO survives and
thrives, continuing to **challenging the existence of states such as
Russia.**]{.underline} [Russian and Western perceptions of the Ukraine
Crisis were so **vastly different**]{.underline}, and it is hard to
reconcile that they are discussing the same event. Former British Prime
Minister David Cameron (2014) called the actions of Russia indefensible,
stating that Ukraine's 'territorial integrity has been violated and the
aspirations of its people to chart their own future are being
frustrated'. Cameron's assertion reflects the Western ideals of
self-determination and freedom. But [Moscow viewed the Maidan protestors
who ousted an elected government as a sinister move by the West to bring
NATO to Ukraine]{.underline}, an objective sought since the late 1990s.
Richard Sakwa (2016) argued [the [structural conditions]{.mark} of the
international system, East versus West, [caused the Ukraine crisis but
the West prefers to portray Russia as a foil]{.mark}]{.underline} (5).
Structurally, the growing Western military alliance taking over the home
base of the Black Sea Fleet was too great a relative gain by the West at
Russian expense to allow in terms of the regional power balance. The
Kremlin expanded on the argument that the West's 'meddling' in Ukrainian
affairs sparked internal instability within an already corrupt and
unstable state. The 2015 Russian NSS places the 'blame' for Ukraine
solely at the hands of the West. The document states, 'The support of
the United States and the European Union for the anti-constitutional
coup d'état in Ukraine led to a deep split in Ukrainian society and the
emergence of an armed conflict' (Section II, Paragraph 17). While
difficult to unpack all the potential perspectives of Russia in the
causes of the crisis, the document focuses on two primary reasons: the
internal conflict between eastern and western Ukraine, as a result
Western interference and the perceived demonising of Moscow by Western
influencers. The security strategy continues, "The strengthening of far
right nationalist ideology, the deliberate shaping in the Ukrainian
population of an image of Russia as an enemy, the undisguised gamble on
the forcible resolution of intrastate contradictions, and the deep
socioeconomic crisis are turning Ukraine into a chronic seat of
instability in Europe and in the immediate vicinity of Russia's border"
Foundational to the security dilemma is the idea that one state's
increase in security reduces the security of another, should both states
possess benign intentions. While it is difficult to tell a state's
revisionist intentions until after they have initiated conflict, it is
useful to explore how an adversary may view one's actions to
differentiate between calculated aggression and defensive measures of
self-preservation. Unfortunately, short of access to historical files,
like in Germany following the fall of the Nazi regime, much of these
assessments must be inferred. For this purpose, [the following
[evaluation]{.mark} of the Russian perspective **[takes]{.mark} the
[statements by Russian leadership and documents]{.mark}** of the Russian
Federation [at]{.mark}, of close to, [face value]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Based on these data, [Russia feared Ukraine's potential EU membership as
a gateway to NATO accession. In that logic, [NATO brings]{.mark} the
[militarisation]{.mark} of the]{.underline} accessed [state **[by the
American power at the cost of Russian security.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
In this sense, the loss of Near Abroad nations is a zero-sum game, where
they transition from either affiliated states or non-affiliated states
to potential NATO platforms of attacks against Moscow should hostilities
escalate. [Contrary to the U.S. perception, **[even proponents of
offensive realism assert]{.mark} the [defensive motives of
Moscow]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Ukraine. [[Mearsheimer
argued]{.underline}]{.mark} that the Western policies of [[NATO
enlargement]{.underline}]{.mark}, EU expansion and democracy promotion
**[[pose an existential threat to Russian power]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(2014b). [He blamed]{.underline} liberal objectives and the [denials of
Western leaders 'that Putin's behavior might be motivated by legitimate
security concerns']{.underline} (Ibid., 86). Alternatively, Western
officials tend to shift focus from Western actions to Vladimir Putin and
his fear of losing power. Former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael
McFaul (2018) argued that Moscow exaggerates the Western role in the
colour revolutions as the West proves to be a convenient foe (84).
McFaul seemed to dismiss Russian security concerns by arguing Putin's
training in the Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti or the 'KGB' led to
his distrust of the U.S. McFaul continued, that while anti-Western
rhetoric is 'theater intended for a domestic audience', Putin 'genuinely
believed' the U.S. is a threat to his regime (Ibid., 86). This viewpoint
dismisses the balance of power realities in preference for biases at the
individual leadership level. In this regard, Western actions and Russian
insecurities are dismissed as secondary factors to Putin's beliefs as
the primary cause of international tension. [[Russia views Western
actions as **aggressive towards its interests**]{.mark}, regardless of
how Washington interprets its own actions.]{.underline} Russian Foreign
Minister Sergey Lavrov (2016) summarised the Russian counterargument to
the Western narrative. He wrote, "Western propaganda habitually accuses
Russia of 'revisionism,' and the alleged desire to destroy the
established international system, as if it was us who bombed Yugoslavia
in 1999 in violation of the UN Charter and the Helsinki Final Act, as if
it was Russia that ignored international law by invading Iraq in 2003
and distorted UN Security Council resolutions by overthrowing Muammar
Gaddafi's regime by force in Libya in 2011. There are many examples." It
is essential to see how rivals view actions, as states will perceive
their own actions as benign while perceiving those of adversaries as
pure aggression. The Ukraine crisis fits within this framework of a
defensive Russian action for two main reasons. First, the potential
enlargement of NATO, through the EU, into another Russian border nation
removes both critical strategic depth in addition to the essential
Russian Navy base in Sevastopol. Second, the military operations, and
very design of the 'New Look' military, potentially suggest a force
designed to protect Russian interests and with limited capability of
challenging the United States or NATO within Europe. As defensive
realism argues, [[states such as Russia seek]{.mark} enough security [to
**maintain the status quo**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} before
diminishing returns on military investment occur through overspending at
the cost of the economy and appearing to possess expansionist intent.
[It is this **misperception** that drives states to see possible hostile
states where a status quo power exists]{.underline}, and Moscow's
actions in Ukraine signalled to the West that Russia has expansionist
tendencies. However, the Kremlin argued that it is the West that seeks
greater influence into Eurasia. At face value, these arguments may
reflect a classic security dilemma. Arguably, a post-Soviet era security
dilemma spiral began when the former Warsaw Pact and Baltic state
entered NATO, for while increasing their own state security they
undermined that of Russia and the region (Sakwa 2016, 4). New NATO
states received the protections under NATO Article 5 as well as
acceptance into the West through the economic benefits provided by the
EU's common market. In theory, small states, such as Estonia and Latvia,
were no longer solely responsible for their own security, particularly
against the potential of a Russian resurgence. Estonia's relatively
small military budget, a meagre U.S.\$267 million in 2003 and U.S.\$281
million in 2004, no longer served as the only protection against
Russia's estimated U.S.\$32 billion military expenditure in 2004 (SIPRI
2019). Moscow, on the other hand, then had NATO member nations on its
border. Moscow has remained sceptical of the security alliance, once
aimed at defending Western Europe from the Soviet Union remaining in
existence following its collapse. Richard Sakwa (2016) argued that
NATO's very being is 'justified by the need to manage the security
threats provoked by its enlargement' (4). While this commentary ignores
why the former Warsaw Pact and Baltic states would perceive Moscow as a
threat, it still serves to represent the alternative viewpoint, not of a
benevolent NATO seeking peace and justice, but of a menacing military
alliance taking over strategic territory through membership.
Furthermore, NATO is viewed as a lingering tool of U.S. dominance in
Europe. For many realists, the survival of NATO following the Cold War
says more about American power and influence over Europe than
multilateral institutions (Waltz 2000, 20). Waltz argued, 'that
international institutions serve primarily national rather than
international interests' (21). In other words, [[NATO]{.mark} survived
because it was in the **national interest of the United States** and its
expansion [continues to be a **policy pursued for American interests**.
Moscow]{.mark}, therefore, **[perceives NATO as an imperial weapon of
an]{.mark} expansionist, [unchecked U.S. power]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
To this end, [Russia sees NATO as a weapon against its interests and a
potential **[threat to its survival]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Russian
academic Sergei Karaganov (2014) argued, 'the [West has continually
sought to expand its zone of military, economic, and political influence
through NATO]{.underline} and the EU. Russian interests and objections
were flatly ignored. Russia was treated like a defeated power, though we
did not see ourselves as defeated'. This perception is not isolated
within Moscow. [Prominent Cold War figures warned of the policy of
expansion towards Russian borders.]{.underline} George Kennan (1997),
the American diplomat and author of the original containment policy,
warned that expansion of NATO would be disastrous for U.S.--Russia
relations, as perception in Moscow questions the need for a military
alliance following the end of hostile tensions.

[The three smartest words]{.underline} that Donald [Trump
uttered]{.underline} during his presidential campaign are **["[NATO is
obsolete]{.mark}."]{.underline}** His adversary, Hillary Clinton,
retorted that NATO was "the strongest military alliance in the history
of the world." Now that Trump has been in power, the White House parrots
the same worn line that NATO is "the most successful Alliance in
history, guaranteeing the security, prosperity, and freedom of its
members." But Trump was right the first time around: [Rather than being
a strong alliance with a clear purpose, this 70-year-old organization
that is meeting]{.underline} in London on December 4 [is a **stale
military holdover** from the Cold War days that **should have gracefully
retired** many years ago. NATO was]{.underline} originally
[founded]{.underline} by the United States and 11 other Western nations
[as an attempt to curb the rise of communism]{.underline} in 1949. Six
years later, Communist nations founded the Warsaw Pact and through these
two multilateral institutions, the entire globe became a Cold War
battleground. When the USSR collapsed in 1991, the Warsaw Pact disbanded
but NATO expanded, growing from its original 12 members to 29 member
countries. North Macedonia, set to join next year, will bring the number
to 30. NATO has also expanded well beyond the North Atlantic, adding a
partnership with Colombia in 2017. Donald Trump recently suggested that
Brazil could one day become a full member. [NATO's]{.underline}
post-Cold War [[expansion]{.mark} toward Russia's borders, despite
earlier promises not to move eastward, has [**led to rising tensions
between** Western powers and Russia, including **multiple close calls**
between military forces. It]{.mark} has also **[contributed to a new
arms race]{.mark}**, including upgrades in nuclear
arsenals]{.underline}, and the largest NATO "war games" since the Cold
War. [While claiming to "preserve peace," NATO has a **history of
bombing civilians** and committing **war crimes**.]{.underline} In 1999,
NATO engaged in military operations without UN approval in Yugoslavia.
Its illegal airstrikes during the Kosovo War left hundreds of civilians
dead. And far from the "North Atlantic," NATO joined the United States
in invading Afghanistan in 2001, where it is still bogged down two
decades later. In 2011, NATO forces illegally invaded Libya, creating a
failed state that caused masses of people to flee. Rather than take
responsibility for these refugees, NATO countries have turned back
desperate migrants on the Mediterranean Sea, letting thousands die. In
London, NATO wants to show it is ready to fight new wars. It will
showcase its readiness initiative---the ability to deploy 30 battalions
by land, 30 air squadrons and 30 naval vessels in just 30 days, and to
confront future threats from China and Russia, including with hypersonic
missiles and cyberwarfare. [But far from being a lean, mean war machine,
[NATO is]{.mark} actually [riddled with **divisions**]{.mark} **and
contradictions**.]{.underline} Here are some of them: French President
Emmanuel [[Macron questions the U.S. commitment]{.underline}]{.mark} to
fight for Europe, has called NATO "brain dead" and has proposed a
European Army under the nuclear umbrella of France. [[Turkey]{.mark} has
**[enraged NATO members]{.mark}** with its incursion into Syria to
attack the Kurds]{.underline}, who have been Western allies in the fight
against ISIS. And [Turkey has [threatened to **veto** a Baltic defense
plan]{.mark} until allies support its controversial incursion into
Syria]{.underline}. Turkey has also infuriated NATO members, especially
Trump, by purchasing Russia's S-400 missile system. [Trump wants NATO to
push back against China's growing influence]{.underline}, including the
use of Chinese companies for the construction of 5G mobile
networks---[something]{.underline} many [NATO countries are
**unwilling** to do.]{.underline} Is Russia really NATO's adversary?
France's [Macron has reached out to Russia]{.underline}, inviting Putin
to discuss ways in which the European Union can put the Crimean invasion
behind it. Donald Trump has publicly attacked Germany over its Nord
Stream 2 project to pipe in Russian gas, but a recent German poll saw 66
percent wanting closer ties with Russia. The [UK has bigger problems.
[Britain has been convulsed over]{.mark} the [Brexit]{.mark}
conflict]{.underline} and is holding a contentious national election on
December 12. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, knowing that Trump is
wildly unpopular, is reluctant to be seen as close to him. Also,
Johnson's major contender, Jeremy Corbyn, is a reluctant supporter of
NATO. While his Labour Party is committed to NATO, over his career as an
anti-war champion, [Corbyn has called NATO "a danger to world peace and
a danger to world security."]{.underline} The last time Britain hosted
NATO leaders in 2014, Corbyn told an anti-NATO rally that the end of the
Cold War "should have been the time for NATO to shut up shop, give up,
go home and go away." A further complication is Scotland, which is home
to a very unpopular Trident nuclear submarine base as part of NATO's
nuclear deterrent. A new Labour government would need the support of the
Scottish National Party. But its leader, Nicola Sturgeon, insists that a
precondition for her party's support is a commitment to close the base.
[[Europeans can't stand Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} (a recent poll found
he is trusted by only 4 percent of Europeans!) [and their leaders
**can't rely** on him.]{.underline} Allied leaders learn of presidential
decisions that affect their interests via Twitter. The lack of
coordination was clear in October, when Trump ignored NATO allies when
he ordered U.S. special forces out of northern Syria, where they had
been operating alongside French and British commandos against Islamic
State militants. The U.S. unreliability has led the European Commission
to draw up plans for a European "defense union" that will coordinate
military spending and procurement. The next step may be to coordinate
military actions separate from NATO. The Pentagon has complained about
EU countries purchasing military equipment from each other instead of
from the United States, and has called this defense union "a dramatic
reversal of the last three decades of increased integration of the
transatlantic defence sector." [Do Americans really want to go to war
for Estonia? Article 5 of the Treaty states that an attack against one
member "shall be considered an attack against them all,"]{.underline}
meaning that the treaty obligates the U.S. to go to war on behalf of 28
nations---something most [likely **opposed** by war-weary
Americans]{.underline} who want a less aggressive foreign policy that
focuses on peace, diplomacy, and economic engagement instead of military
force. [An [additional]{.mark} major bone of [contention is **who will
pay** for NATO.]{.mark}]{.underline} The last time NATO leaders met,
President Trump derailed the agenda by berating NATO countries for not
paying their fair share, and at the London meeting, [Trump is expected
to announce symbolic U.S. cuts to NATO's operations budget.]{.underline}
Trump's main concern is that member states step up to the NATO target of
spending 2 percent of their gross domestic products on defense by 2024,
a goal that is unpopular among Europeans, who prefer that their tax
dollars go to nonmilitary items. Nevertheless, NATO Secretary-General
Jens Stoltenberg will brag that Europe and Canada have added \$100
billion to their military budgets since 2016---something Donald Trump
will take credit for---and that more NATO officials are meeting the 2
percent goal, even though a 2019 NATO report shows only seven members
have done so: the U.S., Greece, Estonia, the UK, Romania, Poland and
Latvia. In an age where people around the world want to avoid war and to
focus instead on the climate chaos that threatens future life on earth,
[[NATO is an anachronism]{.mark}. It now accounts for about
three-quarters of military spending and weapons]{.underline} dealing
around the globe. [[Instead of preventing war, it]{.mark} **promotes
militarism**, exacerbates global tensions and **[makes war more
likely.]{.mark}**]{.underline} This Cold War relic shouldn't be
reconfigured to maintain U.S. domination in Europe, or to mobilize
against Russia or China, or to launch new wars in space. It should not
be expanded, but disbanded. Seventy years of militarism is more than
enough.

BRUSSELS --- Treated with contempt by President Trump, who considers
them rivals and deadbeats instead of allies, many [[European
leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} look forward to the possibility of a Biden
presidency. But they [[are]{.mark} painfully [aware]{.mark}
that]{.underline} four years of Mr. [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} have
[changed the world --- and the United States --- in ways that [will
**not be** ]{.mark}**easily [reversed]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Even if civility can be restored]{.underline}, a fundamental **[[trust
has been broken]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and many [**European diplomats
and experts** believe that U.S. foreign policy is **no longer
bipartisan, so**]{.underline} is **[no longer reliable]{.underline}**.
"[The]{.underline} shining [city on the hill is **not**]{.underline} as
**[shining]{.underline}** as it used to be," Reinhard Bütikofer, a
prominent German member of the European Parliament, put it bluntly.

For the first time, said Ivan Krastev, director of the Center for
Liberal Strategies, "Europeans are afraid that [there is no longer a
foreign-policy consensus in the United States. Every new administration
can mean a totally new policy]{.underline}, and for them **[this is a
nightmare]{.underline}**."

The ideological divide will be on display on Thursday, when Mr. Trump
and Joseph R. Biden Jr. are scheduled to hold their final presidential
debate.

There will be what most consider low-hanging fruit for a Biden
administration that will please Europeans. The crop includes an
extension to the New Start nuclear arms control treaty with Russia and
returns to the Paris climate accord, the World Health Organization and
even the Iran nuclear accord. There will be feel-good meetings and
statements about multilateralism, less confrontation about trade,
renewed efforts to reform the World Trade Organization and a less
combative atmosphere at summit meetings of the Group of 7 and NATO.

But Mr. [[Trump's complaints are shared by]{.mark} many
[Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [given the polarization in
America]{.underline}, President Emmanuel Macron of [France]{.underline}
has [pushed Europe to step up]{.underline} in an altered world, where
**[[China is rising]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration **[is only a symptom of an
American retreat]{.underline}** from global leadership, [not the
cause]{.underline}.

The idea of [[European]{.underline}]{.mark} "strategic
[[autonomy]{.underline}]{.mark}" --- of a Europe less dependent on
Washington and with its own strong voice in the world --- has been
[[gaining ground]{.underline}]{.mark}, even if it is more aspiration
than reality.

Some, like Nathalie Tocci, director of Italy's Institute of
International Affairs, and François Heisbourg, a French **[security
analyst, fear]{.underline}** that [a Biden presidency could
short-circuit European autonomy and let Europeans]{.underline} continue,
as Ms. Tocci said, "**[stick]{.underline}**ing **[our heads in the
sand]{.underline}**."

A Trump re-election, of course, might accelerate the trend toward
autonomy, even if few believe that Mr. Trump would be able to pull out
of NATO, as one of his former national security advisers, John Bolton,
suggested he might.

American [foreign policy was traditionally bipartisan]{.underline} ---
the old phrase that "politics stops at the water's edge" had merit,
especially during the Cold War. [But the collapse of the Soviet Union
meant]{.underline} that foreign policy, too, was subject to deepening
political **[polarization]{.underline}** in the United States.

"[[There is]{.mark} an **incredible [decay]{.mark}** [in Europe of the
sense of the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates as a leader,"
[accelerated]{.mark} and symbolized [by]{.mark} mishandling]{.underline}
of the **[[corona]{.mark}virus]{.underline}**, said Jeremy Shapiro of
the European Council on Foreign Relations.

"**[[Biden doesn't solve their]{.mark} America
[problem]{.mark}]{.underline}**," he said. "[He's not]{.underline} going
to be [president for ever]{.underline}, and Democrats won't always be in
power, and people have learned that the U.S. can't be trusted on foreign
policy, because **[the next administration will come in and wipe it
away]{.underline}**."

The [[inconsistency]{.underline}]{.mark} of U.S. foreign policy **[has
[undermined]{.mark} American [credibility]{.mark}]{.underline}**, some
warned.

**[[There is "an American decline]{.mark} in geopolitical
weight]{.underline}**," said Francis Fukuyama of Stanford University.
"The single fact that shapes [the U.S. role in global politics is
**polarization**]{.underline}, and this **[[polarization will not
disappear]{.underline}]{.mark}** if Joe Biden is elected," he said.
"[[Americans simply **don't agree**]{.mark} with one another on basic
premises, even [on]{.mark} how much America should be involved in
[global affairs and NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}."

William J. Burns, a former senior American diplomat who now runs the
Carnegie Endowment in Washington, thinks **[[the damage is
lasting]{.mark}, no matter who wins]{.underline}** the election.

"[One of the more insidious effects of polarization is to make foreign
policy a tool of **[partisan politics]{.mark}**]{.underline}," he said.
"[It's]{.underline} done [enduring [damage]{.mark} to [America's
reputation]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}in the world for being able to
keep its word."

**The plan solves\-\--causes the [EU to subsume NATO]{.underline} \--
it's key to successful [civilian driven OOAs]{.underline}.**

[An important discussion can start to revolve around whether the USA
still belongs to NATO. Right-sizing]{.underline} is not enlarging; it
[is a change of configuration]{.underline}. Such a change in
configuration is possible in that **[the [US]{.mark}A]{.underline}**
([and we already see increasing Atlantic fractions]{.underline})
**[could [leave NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [and [let]{.mark} the
**[Europeans]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}(including East-European
states) [[take]{.underline}]{.mark} full
[**[responsibility]{.underline}**]{.mark} for their own safety
([including]{.underline} allowing all the Balkan countries into such [an
**EU-NATO arrangement**]{.underline}).

[Letting the USA out of NATO would [imply **subsuming** ]{.mark}**the
European part of [NATO into the EU]{.mark}**. Such a possible
development can have **many advantages**]{.underline} for the countries
concerned, as well as for Russia.

First of all, [subsuming a "NATO-excluding-the-USA" into the EU
would]{.underline}, as mentioned, **[[force]{.mark} the
[Europeans]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}(including the eastern ones)
[[to take]{.mark} full [responsibility]{.mark} for their own security.
This will prevent "moral hazard" of **political escalations** in the
hope that the USA will "save" them]{.underline} or spend money on them
for new US bases in their location. [An EU-NATO (without the USA) would
have to find new ways of working with the UK as well as with, of course,
Russia.]{.underline}

Second, [[there is]{.mark} sometimes [a]{.mark} **profound [need for
measures outside Europe]{.mark}**, where security and civilian efforts
need to be]{.underline} thoroughly [**coordinated**. Using **[NATO
"o]{.mark}ut-[of]{.mark}-[a]{.mark}rea"** [tends to be a]{.mark}
**recipe for [disaster]{.mark}**]{.underline} today, [and]{.underline}
the NATO-bombing creating a collapse of [[**Libya** was
one]{.underline}]{.mark} such catastrophic [example]{.underline}.
Complex **[civilian needs]{.underline}** during conflict basically
**[cannot be taken care of by NATO]{.underline}**, because
[NATO]{.underline} as an organisation (though big enough in bureaucracy)
[is]{.underline} simply [**not designed for civilian efforts** in
connection with conflict. NATO was created to deter an all-destructive
war]{.underline}, which would probably not have left much civilian life
left to "reconstruct" afterwards. [The cold-war scenario was therefore
so totally **different** from the many extremely complicated
**social-economical-etchnical-religious-resource-climate-poverty** types
of civilian-military problems,]{.underline} which we see around in the
world of today. [That is why [NATO]{.mark} interventions
**automatically**, because of the]{.underline} organization's outdated
[design to focus so heavily on]{.underline} a now defunct
"all-or-nothing" type of armagedon-[conflict tends to [create]{.mark}
**purely military**, and hence quite [**destructive, approaches**. NATO
is]{.mark}]{.underline} still so much designed as [[a
**hammer**]{.mark}, that sadly too many [problems seem to be **perceived
as**]{.mark} **if they had the shape of [nails]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
As another example of the results of this, [[take]{.underline}]{.mark} a
look at **[[Afghanistan]{.underline}]{.mark}**, where most of [NATO's
"military-civilian" approaches in reality tended to become too much
"military-more-military" approaches]{.underline}.

[NATO is]{.underline} designed as a [pure military]{.underline}
organization, an by all means, militaries are (still) [designed **only
to destruct, not to construct**. NATO simply [does **not have**]{.mark}
**notable [resources]{.mark} for civilian efforts**]{.underline} to go
with its military efforts. In parallel to this, [we]{.underline}
regrettably also [see]{.underline} in **[the USA a very unfortunate
long-term general tendency to militarize US foreign
policy]{.underline}**, sometimes [at the **expense of resources and
focus for civilian**]{.underline} US [foreign policy. Tools should be
**designed for situations**]{.underline}, not the other way around. But
instead of embarking on the long overdue redesign of the setting of
NATO, a lot of western politicians instead sadly try to redesign
perceptions of today's security-realities in Europe, trying to make the
modern world's security perception look more like the old "them-or-us"
type, which existed during the cold war. But there is a better road,
which can be taken. [The EU does have a **constructive other tradition**
than NATO's]{.underline} "all-out-war-preparedness" to build on, and the
EU is still totally far from the over-militarized development path,
which the USA unfortunately has taken. [The [EU has]{.mark} developed a
**robust and broad [civilian]{.mark}-oriented [conflict
management]{.mark} capability**. [The EU]{.mark}]{.underline} already
[[has]{.mark} quite a range of experience with **civilian
"[o]{.mark}ut-[o]{.mark}f-[a]{.mark}rea" missions**. [And]{.mark} the EU
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} already [developing in a direction [to
integrate]{.mark} all [these]{.mark} political management
[dimensions]{.mark}: The civilian capabilities, and now increasingly
upcoming, also an EU military dimension.]{.underline}

We must remember, that military is politics with other means, and
[**military should not be a destructive stand-alone option**, but part
of]{.underline} as [a]{.underline} series of differentiated [**political
tools**. Not]{.underline} just [a "hammer", but very varying shades and
shapes of tools, within a fully integrated political civil-military
toolbox. It therefore can make enormous sense to
**[leave]{.mark}**]{.underline} the **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**
fully over [[as a new]{.mark} institutional [part of the EU]{.mark}. To
[enable the EU to]{.mark} manage the full range of all political
dimensions]{.underline}, in case a non-European conflict [might [benefit
from European assistance]{.mark}: military, civilian and
economical.]{.underline}

**Civilian driven OOAs solve [terrorism]{.underline} and [African
instability]{.underline} \-- an EU with [all policy tools]{.underline}
is key.**

[Fresh [trouble is brewing]{.mark} on Europe's southern
flank]{.underline}. Surges in migration and the spread of [**jihadi
groups** such as [**Boko Haram**]{.mark} and
**[al-Qaeda]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Islamic Maghreb in recent
years have [made European strategists nervous about [**instability**
in]{.mark} the Sahel and Horn of **[Africa]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Germany, the Netherlands, and Nordic countries have sent peacekeepers to
Mali. French commandos are tracking down jihadis across the Sahel.
British troops are serving with the United Nations in South Sudan.
[European Union missions are training]{.underline} Malian and Somali
[soldiers and]{.underline} Nigerien [police officers, while EU-flagged
ships patrol]{.underline} the Mediterranean and the coast around the
Horn of Africa looking [for human traffickers and pirates. European
governments and institutions]{.underline} have ploughed funds into UN
agencies and [looked to cut deals with African governments]{.underline}
to stem migratory flows across the Sahara. Yet serious **[[violence
persists]{.underline}]{.mark}** from Nigeria to the Sudans,
[**[fuelling]{.mark} a humanitarian [crisis]{.mark} that
[threatens]{.mark} to create more [instability]{.mark}** [on Europe's
borders]{.mark}]{.underline}.

UN officials have warned that northern Nigeria, South Sudan, and Somalia
are all on the brink of famine.\[1\] A combined total of 25 million
people need help in these three countries and the UN estimates that it
requires \$4.4 billion to deal with these immediate challenges and the
parallel threat of famine in Yemen. The citizens of these countries are
being displaced in numbers comparable to the mass flight from Syria,
with two million internally displaced persons in northern Nigeria and
over three million in South Sudan. Two million Somalis are either
displaced inside the country or living in neighbouring countries.

[If the **humanitarian situation** in one or more of these countries
**deteriorates**]{.underline} in the short or medium term, [the chances
of large numbers of new **refugees and migrants**]{.underline} looking
for ways [to Europe will be high]{.underline}. The odds that recent EU
efforts to bolster regional mechanisms will be able to handle the flow
are uncertain. Even if human flows can be controlled, international
donors will need to dig deep to find additional cash to address these
four crises. As of mid-April, the UN had received only one-fifth of the
funds it needs to manage them.\[2\]

The UN, already overstretched by the crisis in Syria, has been asking
for record sums of around \$20 billion a year to cover humanitarian
needs.\[3\] Before he became secretary-general in late 2016, Antonio
Guterres described the organisation's relief efforts as "broke and
failing".\[4\] The UN's latest calls for more money have, however,
coincided with a series of threats from the new American administration
to cut its contributions to multilateral activities by half or more.
While this proposal has to be approved by Congress, it would create vast
funding gaps for some of the biggest UN agencies that rely most heavily
on aid from the United States. Washington gave a combined total of
nearly \$3.5 billion to the World Food Programme (WFP) and UN refugee
agency (UNHCR) in 2016, representing about a third of the total budget.
The EU institutions and Germany, the biggest individual European donor,
gave about \$1.2 billion each to the two institutions combined. Although
EU members could fill the funding gap in theory, doing so would create
financial and political strains for them at home. The EU's high
representative, Federica Mogherini, has warned that if the projected US
cuts go through "certain regions of the world would get completely
destabilised."\[5\]

In sum, [Europe faces a **humanitarian catastrophe** to its
south]{.underline}, and just as its major ally is distancing itself from
some of the multilateral organisations that are meant to mitigate such
problems. Even if Congress does not enforce all the possible US cuts, it
remains prudent to assume that the Trump administration will do as much
as it can to avoid new humanitarian commitments in future. This is not
only a test of Europe's financial resources and humanitarian instincts.
It is also a serious challenge to European crisis managers on the
frontline.

[The current humanitarian crises to Europe's south]{.underline} mainly
[stem from **political [instability and]{.mark} recurrent
[conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Despite the flurry of European
efforts to boost security across the region, [instability [is]{.mark}
likely [to remain]{.mark} endemic for the foreseeable
future]{.underline}. Large-scale UN-led and African-led peace operations
have struggled to build order from Mali to Somalia. The decade-old blue
helmet mission in Darfur, once the darling of humanitarian campaigners,
appears to be especially vulnerable. UN aid workers, crisis managers,
and even the secretary-general argue that it is no longer possible to
mitigate the region's conflicts and manage its fragility through
reactive humanitarian deployments and stabilisation missions.

This report argues that European governments and **[the [EU]{.mark} as a
whole [need to invest]{.mark}]{.underline}** in more proactive efforts
[**[to manage]{.mark} the sources of [disorder]{.mark}** in]{.underline}
the Sahel and the Horn of [**Africa**. This means [strengthening
**European civilian crisis management**]{.mark} **mechanisms and
missions**]{.underline} (defined in more detail below) [[and]{.mark}
concentrating on **[mediating]{.mark} recurrent
[conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline} rather than simply trying to help
African governments manage migrant flows better. [In some cases,
European crisis managers **should lead these political
efforts**]{.underline} -- and this is a field in which the United
Kingdom and EU can continue to cooperate despite Brexit -- but in
others, UN officials and African diplomats are better placed take the
lead. Even so, [EU members can]{.underline} still **[provide resources
and diplomatic support]{.underline}** to help them tackle complex
crises. **[[European support]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the UN and
African Union [[will be]{.mark} even **more
[important]{.mark}**]{.underline} if the Trump administration insists on
cutting back existing peacekeeping missions across the Sahel. [There is
both a **moral and political imperative** to ease the
suffering]{.underline} to the south -- and [taking early steps to tackle
these humanitarian [crises is an opportunity to]{.mark} show that [the
EU]{.mark} has not entirely lost a sense of strategic
purpose.]{.underline}

While [addressing [the challenges]{.mark}]{.underline} to Europe's south
[[require]{.mark}s [a **range of policy tools**]{.mark}]{.underline} --
ranging [from]{.underline} basic food [aid to military]{.underline}
action -- this report focuses on **[civilian crisis management as an
essential part]{.underline}** of the equation. 'Civilian crisis
management' is a fairly expansive term: recent EU civilian missions have
done everything from monitoring ceasefire lines in Georgia to helping
boost security arrangements at South Sudan's international airport. This
report notes that, when it comes to the Sahel, the EU increasingly
equates civilian crisis response with programmes to improve border
management and policing mechanisms to minimise migration flows. But,
while this sort of capacity-building may be useful, the report argues
that [it is]{.underline} also [necessary to invest in politically
focused crisis management]{.underline}, including: firstly, mediating in
major conflicts and situations of lower-level violence; secondly, using
political leverage and persuasion to get governments and rebel groups to
allow aid into areas hit by humanitarian crises; and, thirdly,
coordinating closely with other players, like the UN and the AU, [to
create strong diplomatic frameworks to **[stop existing conflicts
spreading]{.mark} and potential crises spinning [out of
control]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Politically focused [[civilian crisis management]{.underline}]{.mark} is
hard to deliver, and success is even harder to guarantee. But, as this
report argues, it **[[is crucial]{.mark} to mitigating the cycles of
violence]{.underline}** affecting the Sahel and Horn of Africa --
[[without it]{.mark}, more technocratic [assistance will be in
vain]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The end of the Cold War might have represented the end of mutually
assured destruction ([MAD]{.underline}), but it [did not]{.underline}
necessarily [dispel the dangers of the nuclear age]{.underline} -- in
fact, to some extent the globalised [proliferation of non-conventional
weapons has instead escalated the possibilities for a nuclear attack
being carried out]{.underline}. During the Cold War, the belligerents of
any nuclear conflict would have been easily identifiable; however, in
the post-Cold-War era, non-state actors and [[**terrorist** groups like
**Boko Haram**]{.mark} have [emerged as]{.mark} potential [players
in]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}a new variety of [**[nuclear
conflicts]{.underline}**]{.mark} that would entirely be based on
terrorist models. The ominous possibilities for this new kind of warfare
are indeed terrifying, and [[the rise in terrorist
attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} around the globe [[enhances]{.mark} the
[likelihood]{.mark} of such an occurrence]{.underline}. Since 9/11, the
body of academic literature on the threat posed by terrorists regarding
weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and chemical, biological,
radiological and nuclear (CBRN) devices has increased. In Gary Ackerman
and Jeremy Tamsett's edited volume, Jihadists and Weapons of Mass
Destruction, there is disagreement as to whether this threat is
overestimated or underestimated.1 In recent times, however, [ample
ideological [incentive for the use of **CBRN**]{.mark} devices [has been
provided]{.mark}]{.underline} by the likes of Abu Mus'ab al-Suri --
author of the 'Global Islamic Resistance Call' -- who has stated that
'\[t\]he aim of carrying out resistance missions and individual jihad
terrorism "jihad al-irhabi al-fardi" is to inflict the largest human and
material casualties possible on American interests and its allied
countries'.2 This echoes the previous call of Grand Ayatollah Ahmad
Husayni al-Baghdadi, who maintained:

> If the objective and subjective conditions materialize, and there are
> soldiers, weapons, and money -- even if this means using biological,
> chemical, and bacterial weapons -- we will conquer the world, so that
> 'There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is His Prophet' will be
> triumphant over the domes of Moscow, Washington, and Paris.3

[[For Boko Haram and other]{.underline}]{.mark} group[[s,
there]{.underline}]{.mark} definitely exists a strong [[motivation
for]{.underline}]{.mark} the use of **[[WMDs]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and
the global reach of this thinking is not in doubt:

> The globalization of the jihadist struggle has also led to an
> increased emphasis on Islamic identity. In combination with the
> ideological theme of revenge, the global struggle for Islamic identity
> has the potential to create a new jihadist cultic worldview in which
> its endorsers seek out WMDs because they represent the only means to
> significantly transform reality.4

Contextual scenarios in Nigeria strongly suggest that [Boko Haram is one
such group]{.underline} [which has embraced the jihadist world view that
endorses the use of WMDs]{.underline}. In this regard, the strengthened
affiliation of Boko Haram's splinter group -- the Islamic State West
Africa Province (ISWAP) -- with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria
(ISIS) confirms their ideological persuasions. The motivation for Boko
Haram to use such weapons is thus grounded in the recent use of chemical
weapons by ISIS in both Iraq and Syria against both military and
civilian targets.5 If ISIS is claiming ownership of a faction of Boko
Haram as its West African province, it is likely to extend its tactics
to its African allies.

In the light of the above, the use of WMDs by terrorists cannot be
explained within the framework of orthodox terrorism theories. With this
in mind, what Russell Worth Parker refers to as the 'Islamic just war
theory' suitably anchors a discourse on terrorism and advanced weapons
of war.6 Most theorists do not support a subjective theory of 'just
war', but rather the traditional version that relies on Western ideas of
morality and proportionality, as well as on motives for waging war.7 On
the other hand, jihadist traditions reinterpret just war's key tenet of
proportionality to suit Islamists' conflict rationale. According to the
Western form of just war theory, wherein discrimination proves
strategically impossible, any response should be proportionate to the
action that compels it -- hence, proportionality dictates that a
military operation should not cause greater harm than the act that it
was designed to counter or prevent.8 This proportionality argument is
exemplified in the use of nuclear weapons in the Second World War; since
casualty estimates for an invasion of Japan exceeded one million Allied
lives, with similar estimates for Japanese military and civilians, a
nuclear attack was preferable. Eventually, the actual casualties
suffered from the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki reached 200,000,
which represents 10% of the casualties that would likely have been
incurred if Japan had been invaded (see https://avalon.law.yale.edu/).
In the light of this argument, justification for the use of WMDs by
terrorist groups would rest on their interpretation of the extent of the
damage caused by the military aggression and long-term imperialism of
Western powers.

Fighting faceless enemies in a CBRN conflict, whether in West Africa or
the Middle East, is hard to imagine. Enemies who can easily blend into
the crowd and take on the face of ordinary civilians represent a
nightmare scenario for security strategists all around the world. [The
risk of WMDs falling into the hands of terrorist groups]{.underline} is
largely dependent on their ability to obtain weapons-grade nuclear
material like uranium and plutonium, combined with gaining the
capability to build and deploy weapons which make use of them. The
[global proliferation]{.underline} of nuclear material [has made this
possible]{.underline} today.

Global proliferation of fissile material

The collapse of the Soviet military-industrial complex ushered in a
period of uncertainty regarding the security of nuclear material.
Consequently, the risk of fissile material falling into the hands of
terrorist groups -- or into the hands of states that sympathise with or
harbour such groups -- increased considerably. Lax security at former
Soviet nuclear facilities was widespread, making the theft of nuclear
material possible. In the chaos that followed the Soviet collapse in the
early 1990s, radioactive material was frequently stolen from poorly
guarded reactors and nuclear facilities in Russia and its former
satellite states. Police operations have intercepted shipments of Soviet
nuclear material in cities as far away as Munich and Prague, and experts
believe that large batches are still unaccounted for and most likely
accessible to well-connected traders on the black market.9

Over 1800 metric tons of nuclear material is still stored in facilities
belonging to more than 25 countries all around the world.10 Not all of
this material is located in military stockpiles -- in fact, most
countries maintain civil stockpiles of plutonium for use in nuclear
power reactors. The civil stockpiles in the United Kingdom (UK), India,
Belgium, France, Germany, Japan and Russia add up to over 230 metric
tons of plutonium. In spite of these enormous quantities, the UK, India,
France, Japan and Russia have not yet reduced the reprocessing of
plutonium for civil use. Although civil plutonium is not weapons-grade,
it remains viable as a raw material that can be transformed through an
enrichment process for use in a bomb. The United States (US) on the
other hand has a comparatively small amount of civil plutonium because
of its 1970 policy to suspend the separation of plutonium from spent
nuclear fuel.11

About 25 kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU) is required to build a bomb
-- an insignificant amount in comparison to the global stockpile, which
is in excess of 1.6 million kg. On the other hand, about 8 kg of
plutonium is needed to build a bomb -- a tiny fraction of the 500,000 kg
global stockpile.12 Nuclear facilities that are relics of the Cold War
era, especially those located in Eastern Europe, represent a high
security risk. More than 130 nuclear reactors powered by HEU are
operational in over 40 countries -- the fallout of an early Cold-War-era
programme in which the US and the Soviet Union helped their allies to
obtain nuclear technology. Several other reactors have been shut down
but may still contain nuclear fuel on site. In total, the world's
research reactors contain 22 tons of HEU -- enough to build hundreds of
nuclear bombs. The problem is that research reactor fuel tends to be
stored under notoriously light security, making it a very vulnerable
target for terrorists.13

In 2004, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a
report that details security lapses at civilian nuclear installations,
citing a case in which the fences surrounding an unnamed foreign
research reactor were in very poor condition and there were no guards
securing the reactor building itself. In this report, Harvard expert
Matthew Bunn explains that unlike the bulky and extremely radioactive
fuel rods used in commercial nuclear power plants, research reactor fuel
consists of small pellets that weigh only a few pounds each and moreover
are easier to handle --a simple backpack can conceal several pellets.14
Naturally, civilian stockpiles are at greater risk of theft than those
held in military installations. Consequently, the possibilities of such
dangerous material falling into the hands of terrorists groups have
become increasingly plausible.

Regarding military stockpiles, Russia and the US possess the largest
amounts of weapons-grade plutonium -- 100 and 150 metric tons,
respectively. Diplomatic attempts aimed at reducing these stockpiles
have resulted in an agreement for the two countries to dispose of 34
metric tons each via the method of turning the weapons-grade plutonium
into fuel for nuclear power reactors. Although this agreement has not
been effected yet, it is obvious given the above that the process may
expose the material to greater risk of theft rather than securing it.15
On the other hand, in 2005 the US Congress eliminated the long-standing
restrictions that were placed on the exporting of HEU to other countries
for the purpose of manufacturing medical isotopes, which has also
created new avenues for the proliferation of nuclear material through
civilian use.16

Although the civilian use of nuclear material has increased the risk of
its proliferation, the military facilities currently holding nuclear
material around the world -- especially in Russia -- are also not well
secured. Thousands of Cold-War-era tactical weapons are stored at very
poorly guarded military installations, and most of these weapons are
small and do not have electronic locks that prevent unauthorised
usage.17 Since the collapse of the Soviet Union there has been no viable
security strategy for securing the nuclear material contained in many of
the former empire's cities. During the Cold War era, the citizens of
these cities had access to these facilities -- and they still do, a
problem further compounded by the fact that a strict inventory of the
nuclear material contained in these facilities is not maintained.18

The likes of infamous arms dealer Leonid Minin (who was found guilty in
a court of law for supplying weapons to non-state actors in African
conflicts) are all too willing to do business with terrorists.19, 20
Arms dealers and smugglers all over the world are always seeking
lucrative opportunities, and it is almost certain that some nuclear
material has already been acquired by dangerous fanatics.

Several incidents in recent decades give every reason to believe that
this is the case. In 1993, Kazakhstani authorities discovered HEU
capable of arming 20 bombs in a building that was poorly secured.21 In
2006, Russian citizen Oleg Khinsagov was arrested in Georgia for
carrying 100 g of HEU and attempting to find a buyer for what he claimed
was many additional kilograms.22 In 2011, six men with 4 g of uranium
were arrested by security forces in Moldova. Upon questioning, they
claimed that the 4 g represented a sample of the product they were ready
to market. They claimed to possess an additional 9kg, which represents
one third of the quantity needed to create a nuclear weapon. The leader
of this group and the North African buyer escaped.23 Four years before
this incident, gunmen raided a facility in Pelindaba, South Africa; the
details of the event are still shrouded in mystery.24

[[Efforts by terrorist]{.mark} organisation[s to **purchase and use
nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon[s]{.mark}** [continue]{.mark}
unabated]{.underline}. The most high profile of these known efforts is
that of Osama bin Laden, who in 2001 attempted to purchase a canister of
uranium in Sudan for US\$1.5 million. Intelligence reports claim that he
also met with two Pakistani nuclear scientists, and [[sketches of
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s were found at]{.mark} an **[al-Qaeda]{.mark}**
training camp.25]{.underline}

From the foregoing, it is clear that there exists a robust and thriving
black market in fissile material that seems to be tailor-made for use by
terrorists groups. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as at
December 2015 had recorded in its trafficking database a total of 2889
incidents involving losses, thefts and/or attempts to traffic fissile
material across international borders.26 This is an incredibly high rate
of security lapses considering the security priority that nuclear
facilities are supposed to possess. More pressing is the fact that the
agency does not inspect every nuclear facility globally, and as such is
not in a position to comprehensively enforce strict security and safety
regulations. As a consequence of this, fissile material often goes
missing and subsequently appears on the black market without being
reported to the agency. Furthermore, several nations which maintain
nuclear facilities do not possess the requisite resources to subject
employees to the kind of extensive background checks that can ensure
their trustworthiness for working at such high-security sites. In the
absence of this screening, the likelihood of people with terrorist ties
applying for jobs at nuclear facilities for the purpose of obtaining
nuclear material is very high.

There is mounting evidence worldwide that increasing amounts of fissile
material are being stolen and traded. Although the Russian government
refuses to admit that it has lost any nuclear weapons, at least four
Russian nuclear submarines have sunk, and it is believed that the
warheads on board are yet to be recovered. The US on the other hand has
admitted to losing a staggering 11 nuclear weapons.27

How can Boko Haram obtain nuclear material?

[Boko Haram is one of the deadliest terrorist groups]{.underline} in the
world. Since 2009, it has engaged with the Nigerian state in a lethal
terrorism campaign aimed at toppling the secular structure and replacing
it with an Islamist state. By May 2014 over 12,000 Nigerians had been
killed in the insurgency,28 while one in five persons from Borno, Yobe
and Adamawa states had been internally displaced. According to the 2017
Global Terrorism Index, Boko Haram ranks as the second deadliest
terrorist group in the world, with an all-time high death toll of over
6000 in 2014 alone.29

[With known ties to al-Qaeda, Boko Haram has an estimated annual income
in excess of US\$25 million]{.underline}.30 By 2017, Boko Haram had been
forced to retreat from the large areas it had previously occupied in the
north-east of Nigeria, driven back by the joint international military
efforts of several countries in West and Central Africa. This created
the need for them to reassert themselves. The likelihood of this group
re-strategising and reconsolidating is high. Consequently, their
[[acquisition of]{.underline}]{.mark} fissile material for the
development and deployment of radiological '[[dirty
bombs']{.underline}]{.mark} has [[increased]{.underline}]{.mark} in
probability. The [[availability of this material]{.underline}]{.mark} on
the continent and [within]{.underline} Nigeria itself [[presents
**ominous opportunities**]{.underline}]{.mark} for the group. Apart from
large deposits of uranium ore found [[in Africa]{.underline}]{.mark},
several countries including South Africa, Morocco, Libya, Ghana, Egypt,
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Nigeria itself presently
possess nuclear research reactors.31

The IAEA has reported no less than 12 incidents of natural uranium
smuggling between 1995 and 2005 in Africa alone. In fact, illegal
uranium mining at the Shinkolobwe mine in Katanga, DRC is presently a
source of great concern. More importantly, this is where the source
material for the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs was obtained.32 The
proliferation of fissile material across the continent heightens the
possibility of non-state actors like Boko Haram gaining access to it.
Although there has only been one recorded theft of eight uranium fuel
rods from a Kinshasa research reactor in 1997, the disturbing fact about
this is that seven of the rods were never recovered.33

Within Nigeria itself, opportunities abound for terrorist groups like
Boko Haram and other militant organisations to obtain fissile material
for use in nuclear devices or dirty bombs. In 2004, Nigeria commissioned
a 30-kW miniature neutron source reactor (NIRR-1) for the purpose of
nuclear energy research.34 This nuclear facility is located at the
Centre for Energy Research and Training at Ahmadu Bello University Zaria
in the north of the country, where terrorist activities and Islamist
extremism have been going on for centuries. The possibility of Islamist
extremists infiltrating nuclear facilities and smuggling out fissile
material has been an ongoing security concern for a number of years. An
outright attack on a lightly secured facility is a second possibility
that actually played out in 2007, when a nuclear research facility in
Pelindaba, South Africa was raided by armed assailants, who breached its
security perimeter and gained entry.35 Another concern is unsecured
radioactive waste -- namely 234 legacy sources presently located at the
Ajaokuta Steel Company in Kogi State -- that has not been disposed of
and could easily be obtained by Boko Haram.36 To complicate matters
further, the construction of a low to medium radioactive waste
management facility at Nigeria's Nuclear Technology Centre has been
abandoned.37

Can Boko Haram build and use non-conventional weapons?

The poor state of nuclear security combined with the tenacity of Boko
Haram makes Nigeria a prime location for the advent of nuclear
terrorism. Knowhow on building a nuclear device is widely available, as
is the key component, [[HEU]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[can be found
all over the world]{.underline}]{.mark} in dozens of military and
civilian nuclear facilities -- like the one at Ahmadu Bello University.
Once Boko Haram has obtained enough HEU, a choice can be made between
two types of nuclear device. The first is the gun-type mechanism, in
which the HEU is smashed together to produce an explosion. The second
type, which is more advanced, requires a chamber in which the HEU is
compressed in a highly symmetrical manner in order to create an
implosion. The gun-type mechanism is the more likely option for
terrorist groups because it is simpler.38

In order to use the gun-type mechanism to activate a nuclear device,
Boko Haram operatives would need to assemble a crude cannon that can
smash HEU together -- and the more highly enriched the uranium, the less
advanced the weaponry that is needed. The viability of any terrorist
group accomplishing such a task has been tested by US senator Joe Biden.
In 2004 he asked scientists at three national laboratories to see if
they could assemble the mechanical components of a gun-type bomb with
commercially available equipment alone. A few months later, they
reported back that they had succeeded.39 With over US\$25 million in
annual income, Boko Haram has the resources to obtain both the
scientific knowhow and the materials needed to build and deploy a
gun-type nuclear weapon.

Radiological dirty bombs

The threat of non-conventional weapons proliferation and terrorism goes
beyond nuclear weapons -- it also encompasses radiological dirty bombs.
The raw materials used to create nuclear weapons are very dangerous;
they contain highly radioactive substances that would pose a serious
health hazard if dispersed in human populations using a detonation
device. Plutonium and uranium could thus be weaponised in the form of a
radiological dirty bomb, also known as a radiological dispersal device
(RDD), which would cause widespread fatalities and cost billions of
dollars in clean-up, evacuation and relocation operations.40

Terrorist groups like [[Boko Haram could easily build and use an
RDD]{.underline}]{.mark}, given the widespread proliferation of fissile
material -- and more importantly given the dual-use materials that can
produce the same radiological effects as fissile material from nuclear
installations. Radiological dual-use materials from smoke alarms and
medical services are among the most easily accessible; highly
radioactive isotopes are in fact used in life-saving blood transfusions
and cancer treatments in hospitals all around the world, including
several in Nigeria. These isotopes include cesium-137, cobalt-60 and
iridium-192, which can easily be used as base materials for a bomb or an
RDD.41 The challenge is that most of the medical, commercial and
industrial groups that handle these materials are not adequately
equipped to provide the security needed to prevent them from being
stolen. On the other hand, the lack of regulatory controls in many
countries has led to thousands of instances of missing or stolen
radiological material that cannot be accounted for. Recently, the James
Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies found in an alarming study
that 170 incidents where nuclear or radiological material was lost,
stolen or outside regulatory control occurred in 2014 alone.42

RDDs are viable weapons for terrorist groups like Boko Haram to pursue
-- and terrorist states have also attempted to obtain them. On 28 March
2002, Abu Zubaydah -- a key al-Qaeda operative -- was captured in
Pakistan. He is widely believed to have told US investigators that
al-Qaeda was 'interested' in building or obtaining a dirty bomb. Further
evidence emerged on 8 May 2002, when Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) agents arrested Abdullah al Muhajir on charges of planning a
radiological attack in the US at the direction of al-Qaeda operatives.

States that sponsor and support terrorist groups are likely to pass on
fissile and radiological material to them. Iraq under Saddam Hussein is
known to have sought radiological material for this purpose. In 1987,
Iraq tested a bomb weighing 1400 kg that carried radioactive particles
derived from irradiated impurities in zirconium oxide. A further 100
prototypes were designed from the casings of Muthanna-3 aerial chemical
bombs, which were then modified to a 400-kg weight so that aircraft
could carry more of them. It is likely that only 25 of these prototypes
were destroyed, and that the other 75 were sent to the Al Qa Qaa State
Establishment, a massive Iraqi weapons facility; their current status
and whereabouts remain unknown.43

Chemical and biological weapons

The most commonly used non-conventional weapons are chemical or
biological in nature. The long history of chemical and biological
weapons usage dates as far back as 600 BC when, during a siege, Solon of
Athens poisoned the drinking water of the city of Kirrha.44 More
recently -- starting with the use of mustard gas during the First World
War -- nations have acquired chemical and biological weapons easily,
deploying them against enemies and their own citizens alike. [[For
terrorist groups]{.mark} like Boko Haram, [**chemical and biological
weapons** are]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}uniquely suited to their
agenda and as such present very [[attractive]{.underline}]{.mark}
alternatives to nuclear; [they are extremely difficult to detect, cost
effective and easy to deploy]{.underline}. Aerosols of biological agents
are invisible to the naked eye, silent, odourless, tasteless and
relatively easily dispersed. Most importantly they are 600 to 2000 times
cheaper than other WMDs. Recent estimates place the cost of biological
weapons at about 0.05% of the cost of a conventional weapon which could
produce similar numbers of mass casualties per square kilometre.45

[The proliferation of chemical and biological weapons has proved to be
very fluid over the past century due to advancements in
technology]{.underline}. Production is comparatively easy via the
commonplace technology that is used in the manufacturing of antibiotics,
vaccines, foods and beverages, while delivery systems such as spray
devices deployed from airplane, boat or car are widely available.
Another advantage of biological agents is the natural lead time provided
by the organism's incubation period (three to seven days in most cases),
allowing the terrorists to deploy the agent and then escape before an
investigation by law enforcement and intelligence agencies can even
begin. Furthermore, not only would the use of an endemic infectious
agent likely cause initial confusion because of the difficulty of
differentiating between a biological warfare attack and a natural
epidemic, but with some agents the potential also exists for secondary
or tertiary transmission from person to person or via natural vectors.46

Unlike their nuclear and radiological counterparts, biological and
chemical weapons have been used for terrorism by both state and
non-state actors. The challenges faced in preventing the use of these
weapons through international control mechanisms include the increasing
availability of larger quantities of substances, ease of use and most
especially advanced technological deployment facilities that portend a
high risk factor to larger populations. Table 1 catalogues the use of
biochemical weapons in warfare and by terrorists and other groups or
individuals over the past century, offering concrete historical
precedent and empirical grounds for the potential future actions of Boko
Haram. The data shows consistent recourse to the use of these weapons,
in spite of the chemical and biological weapons conventions outlawing
them. It can be seen that from the 1970s onwards there has been an
increase in the use of biochemical weapons by religious cults and
terrorist groups in pursuit of their agendas. The rise of Boko Haram and
its ISIS affiliation could lead to a future where the use of biochemical
weapons is the norm rather than the exception.

As stated previously, the contextual scenarios in Nigeria that validate
this prognosis regarding Boko Haram's possible actions are strongly
supported by their ideological persuasions. The fact that Boko Haram
embraces a jihadist world view which endorses the use of WMDs is
strengthened not only by its affiliation to ISIS through ISWAP but also
by the similarities in its strategic modus operandi. Like ISIS, Boko
Haram both believes in the slaughter of other Muslims who are deemed to
be in cahoots with infidels, and advocates for the destruction of
civilian populations -- whether Muslim or otherwise -- that are regarded
as obstructing the advancement or creation of their caliphate.47 This
was practically demonstrated by ISIS in Syria and Iraq when they used
chemical weapons against both civilian and military populations, as
shown in Table 1.48

Nigeria's counterterrorism strategy

The central control measure for preventing nuclear terrorism is to
ensure at the international level that nuclear material does not fall
into the hands of terrorist groups like Boko Haram and other non-state
actors in the first place. This is very difficult to achieve, given the
lax security measures found at nuclear installations all over the world.
Recognising the danger, the US under the Obama administration committed
in 2010 at a nuclear security summit in Washington DC to securing all
nuclear material within four years in an effort to prevent nuclear
terrorism.49 Nigeria was a participant of this summit and is also
committed to implementing the agreements that were reached. These
attempts by the Obama administration followed up on the efforts embedded
in the landmark 1987 Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear
Material (CPPNM), which was meant to prevent nuclear material from being
obtained by terrorists. The provisions of this convention were amended
in 2005, and by 2010 the Washington summit had created the needed sense
of urgency regarding the security of fissile material.50 Negotiations
around the CPPNM started in 1979,51 and over the decades the growing
proliferation of fissile material has combined with the increase in
global terrorism to raise the profile of the issue of fissile material
security. As of 2016, a total of 93 states including Nigeria had
ratified the CPPNM, resulting in tighter security around the world at
nuclear installations and border controls.

Nigeria has been engaged for decades in international efforts to control
nuclear proliferation and terrorism. The country has ratified and
acceded to over a dozen international instruments since 1963, including
the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board
Aircraft (1963), the CPPNM (1987), the Amendment to the CPPNM (2006) and
the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear
Terrorism (2007).52 At the level of global collective security, Nigeria
is involved in implementing the United Nations (UN) Global
Counter-Terrorism Strategy, which was adopted unanimously by the General
Assembly in Resolution 60/288.53 At the regional and subregional levels,
the counterterrorism strategies of the African Union (AU) and the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have been ratified
and are in the process of being implemented. In pursuance of effecting
these various international agreements, Nigeria has also instituted
their National Counterterrorism Strategy (NACTEST), which was revised in
2016. Presently the country is also working with the UN
Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF) on projects designed
to build community resilience against terrorism, enhance cooperation
among law enforcement agencies and strengthen judicial institutions.54

Towards an integrated chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear
(CBRN) counterterrorism protocol

[**[The CBRN terrorism threat]{.underline}**]{.mark} in Nigeria
[**[is]{.underline}**]{.mark} both **[[real and
present]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The country has one of the highest rates
of terrorist activities in the world; in fact, according to the 2016
Global Terrorism Index, Nigeria ranked third among 163 countries, with a
terrorism death rate of 16.8% of the global total.55 Although attacks
declined in 2017, Nigeria still retained third place on the Global
Terrorism Index.56 Recently, Boko Haram has initiated a comeback that
has seen renewed attacks and the abduction of more girls from schools in
the north-east of the country. Security forces have continued to engage
the group on the frontlines in their forest bases; with the assistance
of local and international joint task forces, much of the conflict has
been shifted to more remote areas in the north-east. Although the
government security forces have gained the upper hand in their frontal
clashes with Boko Haram forces, by January 2018 the group had
successfully carried out several brutal assaults, including one on UN
and Doctors Without Borders staff, shifting their strategy back to
traditional hit-and-run guerrilla tactics. During Easter of the same
year, a single attack utilising 5 suicide bombers resulted in over 29
dead and 84 wounded.57

The likelihood that Boko Haram may begin to use CBRN weapons is
increasing, and biological and chemical terrorism is potentially more
difficult to prevent than conventional terrorist attacks. Since the
latter part of the twentieth century, the Internet has contributed to
the spread of chemical and biological weapons knowhow, thereby
increasing the likelihood of Boko Haram being able to obtain not only
the ingredients needed to create biochemical weapons but also the
information needed to build and successfully deploy them. Some of the
base materials for such weapons even occur naturally, like castor beans,
which can be processed to produce the dangerous toxin ricin and deployed
against unsuspecting populations. Furthermore, live strains of very
dangerous viruses like Ebola can be found in high-tech research labs,
like those at the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics and
Infectious Diseases (ACEGID) at the Redeemer's University Ede in Osun
State. If Boko Haram were to secure this virus and weaponise it, the age
of biowarfare would arrive in Nigeria -- with deadly consequences. More
importantly, the materials that are needed to create most chemical
weapons exist in large quantities as dual-use materials that can be
purchased on the open market and ferried into the country via forged
end-user certificates.

The chemical and biological weapons conventions represent control
structures geared towards the containment of these non-conventional
weapons, and to a large extent state signatories like Nigeria have
implemented a good level of the instruments contained in them; however,
some nations still maintain secret stockpiles and have used them in
recent conflicts, like Iraq against Iran and Kurdish dissidents in the
1980s and 1990s, and the Syrian government, which is presently using
them against its civilian population.

On the whole, the counterterrorism measures put in place to deal with
the aftermath of a chemical or biological attack have gained more
credibility in the international community. Although there is no
dedicated international inter-agency mechanism for coordinating the
response to terrorism involving the release of toxic chemicals or
biological agents, there are mechanisms that have evolved in the context
of humanitarian assistance and emergency response after natural
catastrophes, such as earthquakes; these include the Global Outbreak
Alert and Response Network (GOARN), the World Health Organization (WHO),
the Global Early Warning System (GLEWS), the Global Framework for the
Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases (GF-TAD) and the
International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN). The primary
inter-agency mechanism that coordinates responses to emergencies
involving the agencies mentioned above is the UN Disaster Assessment and
Coordination (UNDAC).58 To further strengthen inter-agency coordination
in the wake of a terrorist attack of catastrophic proportions, the UN
CTITF is also focusing on planning for such an eventuality.

At the local level, several key aspects of Nigeria's NACTEST are
presently being utilised. The strategy is divided into five work
streams:

- Forestall: Prevent terrorism in Nigeria by engaging the public through
  sustained enlightenment and sensitisation campaigns and
  deradicalisation programmes.

- Secure: Ensure the protection of life, property and key national
  infrastructure and public services, including Nigerian interests
  around the world.

- Identify: Ensure that all terrorist acts are properly investigated,
  and that terrorists and their sponsors are brought to justice.

- Prepare: Prepare the populace so that the consequences of terrorist
  incidents can be mitigated.

- Implement: Devise a framework to effectively mobilise and sustain a
  coordinated, cross-governmental, population-centred effort.59

Presently, the first three aspects of these work streams are receiving
full attention. However, in regard to WMDs, the counterterrorism
strategy is lacking a well-integrated CBRN protocol for engaging with
the work streams for preparation and implementation. Nigeria currently
handles issues relating to nuclear and radiological matters through two
institutions: the Nigerian Atomic Energy Agency (NAEC) and the Nigerian
Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NNRA). It is therefore expected that,
given the growing CBRN threat level in the country, these agencies will
collaborate with the Office of the Security Adviser to the President in
order to initiate a proper CBRN counterterrorism protocol.

The NACTEST does not currently include a dedicated protocol for handling
CBRN threats; Nigeria is however involved in nuclear security at the
international level, which has primarily provided for capacity-building
and human resources development. Activities in these areas include the
gradual process of converting the miniature neutron source reactor in
Zaria from using HEU to low enriched uranium (LEU), partnerships for
nuclear and radiological security with the US Department of Defence
(DoD) and the IAEA, establishing a nuclear security support centre in
the country, reviewing the 2012 design basis threat (DBT) for protecting
nuclear and radiological material, the development of a programme for
locating and securing orphan legacy radioactive sources, training
security officers, the installation of a radiation portal monitor at the
Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos in 2008 and the
acquisition of three more monitors for other international airports in
the country.60

An integrated CBRN protocol would fall under the preparation and
implementation work streams of the NACTEST. The protocol should include
a strategy for detecting CBRN agents in the wake of terrorist events,
followed by disaster response and countermeasure initiatives to be
carried out by security, medical and disaster response teams. Given the
availability of advanced technology, the integrated CBRN
counterterrorism protocol should also include the deployment of handheld
radiological and biochemical detectors to high-risk areas, and security
forces and disaster response teams should be trained in their usage.
Embedding a standard protocol in the NACTEST on how to prepare for and
respond to CBRN events is essential for repositioning counterterrorist
activities in the country to meet the present threat level. The US and
Canada along with the UK and most other European countries facing CBRN
threats have already repositioned accordingly in order to accommodate
this new reality.

**[Conclusion]{.underline}**

[Any [terrorist]{.mark} attack involving [WMDs is the **ultimate
nightmare scenario**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fortunately, at least some of
these potential attacks are preventable. If and when the nuclear
security summit achieves its goals, the possibility of a nuclear
terrorist attack in Nigeria will be immensely reduced. Unfortunately,
the likelihood of radiological, chemical and biological attacks is more
difficult to regress, making it all the more vital to integrate a CBRN
protocol into Nigeria's counterterrorism strategy.

[Preventing such a tragic event]{.underline} from occurring [will
require very close ongoing monitoring]{.underline} of the strategic
manoeuvrings of Boko Haram. From its inception to the present day, the
organisation has depended on the looting of military armouries to source
most of its heavy weapons and equipment. It has built up an impressive
arsenal in this manner and there is no indication that the group will
stop using this highly profitable strategy, which could be further
employed to obtain advanced CBRN weaponry from facilities that are
vulnerable to being raided. The civilian facilities mentioned in this
paper are at high risk of being targeted in this fashion; hence, the
recalibration of Nigeria's CBRN counterterrorism protocols should
include a security framework that provides military security for
facilities like the ACEGID in Osun State and the Centre for Energy
Research and Training at Ahmadu Bello University Zaria. Lastly, although
the IAEA has assisted in the conversion of Nigeria's reactor from HEU to
LEU,61 the availability of fissile material at the facility means that
the risk of radioactive dirty bombs being created from looted material
is still present.

also as a contribution to the implementation of the EU Strategy

[[This is a **delicate moment**]{.mark} for the global non-proliferation
regime]{.underline}. The United States have decided to unilaterally
re-impose sanctions on Iran, after their withdrawal from the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action -- a multilateral agreement endorsed by the
UN Security Council. Our European strategic and security interest is
clearly to save the nuclear deal. So we have reacted decisively to
protect both our security interests and our economic sovereignty.

This is also an incentive for Iran to continue comply with its nuclear
restrictions. [[Any alternative could have tragic consequences]{.mark}
-- and it would make all of us **less secure**]{.underline}, both **[[in
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in **[[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates

the world]{.underline}; it has ensured that Iran cannot acquire a
nuclear weapon; it has brought economic benefits to the people of Iran;
and it has opened new channels for diplomacy and dialogue. Preserving
the deal is in everyone\'s interest.

Preserving the deal is also essential to the credibility of multilateral
diplomacy and the global nonproliferation regime. This is even more
important as [talks on the **[North]{.mark} [Korean]{.mark} nuclear
programme** are ongoing]{.underline}. We have always believed that
[sustainable [peace requires]{.mark}]{.underline} a complete, verifiable
and irreversible [**[de-nuclearisation]{.mark}** of the Korean

take time. But this is the only way to achieve an agreement that can
stand the test of time. So [[our]{.mark} policy of \"critical
[engagement\" is more valid than ever]{.mark}]{.underline}. The European

Now, however, [[Iran has begun]{.mark} a]{.underline} slow but steady
[process of [getting]{.mark} out from]{.underline} under many of the
agreement's [limits]{.underline}. It may be doing this to persuade the
US and Europe to ease economic sanctions. [It may]{.underline} also [be
calculating that these steps could dramatically reduce the time it would
need to produce [nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline} without
being attacked. But it is at least as likely [[that]{.mark} Iran's
actions [will lead the **US, or**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}more
probably [**[Israel, to undertake a preventive
strike]{.underline}**]{.mark} designed to destroy a significant part of
its program.

[Such a strike could lead several other [regional
powers]{.mark}]{.underline}, including [**[Turkey, Saudi]{.mark} Arabia,
[and Egypt]{.mark}**, to develop or [acquire **nuc**]{.mark}**lear
weapon[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} of their own. Turkey, increasingly
estranged from many of its allies, has suggested that it may choose to
develop nuclear weapons regardless of what Iran does.

[North Korea is far ahead of Iran]{.underline}: it already has several
dozen nuclear weapons and missiles, has tested missiles that can reach
the US, and is developing submarine-launched nuclear weapons. The notion
that North Korea will agree to give up its weapons and "denuclearize" is
fanciful. Its leader, Kim Jong-un, believes that only nuclear weapons
can ensure his regime's survival, a belief understandably strengthened
by the experience of Ukraine, which accepted security guarantees in
exchange for giving up the nuclear weapons it inherited from the Soviet
Union, only to be invaded by Russia 25 years later.

One risk is that [[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea will]{.underline} over
the next few years come to [possess a significant [arsenal]{.mark} that
[will pose a]{.mark} meaningful [threat]{.mark} to the US.]{.underline}
Another is that North Korea's neighbors, including **[[So]{.mark}uth
[Ko]{.mark}rea [and Japan, will determine]{.mark} that
[they]{.mark}]{.underline}**, too, **[[need nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** given the North Korean threat and their
diminished confidence in the reliability of the US and its guarantees to
protect them with its nuclear forces.

The danger **[[in both regions]{.underline}]{.mark}** is that [[a
race]{.mark} to acquire nuclear weapons [could trigger]{.mark} a
**[preventive war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even if such a war were
avoided, [the presence of multiple nuclear arsenals would increase [the
temptation for one]{.mark} or more countries [to **strike first**
in]{.mark} a [crisis. "**Use them or lose them**"]{.mark} has the
potential to become [a recipe for **instability and
conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline} when capabilities are not sufficiently
robust to absorb an attack and still be able to mete out the sort of
devastating retaliation essential for effective deterrence.

[With]{.underline} [Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} **[stability]{.underline}** [of Europe has
been]{.underline} **[shattered]{.underline}**. After four months of the
"special operation" launched by Vladimir Putin on February 24 to
"demilitarize and de-nazify Ukraine," the liberal international order is
in disarray. The devastation in [Ukraine]{.underline} with total
casualties of more than 10,000 civilians and tens of thousands of
soldiers [has]{.underline} **[resuscitated]{.underline}** [the debate of
whether]{.underline} [**relinquishing** nuclear weapons]{.underline}
[landed Ukraine in this terrible situation.]{.underline}

In 1994, [under the]{.underline} **[Budapest]{.underline}**
[memorandum]{.underline}, [Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan returned
almost 2,000 nuclear weapons to Russia]{.underline}, although Ukraine
never had operational control over the weapons. Politically, Ukraine's
decision to hand over nuclear weapons to Russia allowed Kyiv to sign the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Russia would also likely have
perceived Kyiv's nuclear arsenal as a threat, inflating regional
insecurities. More so, housing nukes could have attracted severe
international economic punishment, which would have curtailed the
prospects of Ukraine's post-Cold War economic growth.

**[However, today]{.underline}** [Ukraine might be wondering whether
keeping its nuclear weapons would have been]{.underline} a
**[better]{.underline}** idea. [The West\'s]{.underline}
**[reticence]{.underline}** [to provide]{.underline} **[timely
help]{.underline}** to Ukraine [could be persuading]{.underline}
**[other states]{.underline}** [to do so]{.underline}.

The West's sympathy for Ukraine and support through sanctions on Russia
shows an appreciation for Kyiv's dire situation. But the West does not
want to get too involved in the war or risk provoking Russia. Direct
intervention would escalate the conflict, as the West's involvement will
be interpreted by Moscow as seeking a "total defeat" of Russia. The fear
of getting entrapped in such a situation precludes NATO from providing
full-fledged support to Ukraine. [Since NATO]{.underline} military [aid
is]{.underline} still **[inadequate]{.underline}**, though generous, [it
will embolden]{.underline} Ukraine to help itself and end up in [the
quest to acquire nuclear weapons.]{.underline}

[Other states]{.underline} **[are suspicious]{.underline}** [of
Washington's **commitment to**]{.underline} [keep them "dry"
under]{.underline} the cover of [its nuclear umbrella]{.underline}. As
more states like Finland and Sweden join NATO, [the reluctance of the
United States]{.underline} "**[to trade]{.underline}** [New
York]{.underline}" [for Helsinki or Stockholm]{.underline} in a nuclear
confrontation **[will increase]{.underline}**. [Fearing]{.underline}
American [abandonment]{.underline}, [states like Germany and Japan
that]{.underline} **[already]{.underline}** [maintain]{.underline}
**[latent nuclear]{.underline}** [capabilities will **activate**
them]{.underline}.

The neutral states turning to the West have increased Washington's
responsibility to navigate the risks posed by the Russo-Ukrainian War
carefully. The West\'s disposition, ultimately, will be a litmus test of
its credibility as a reliable partner. [Failing to]{.underline}
**[assuage]{.underline}** [their fears]{.underline}, the [states
observing the plight of Ukraine may]{.underline} **[seriously
consider]{.underline}** [going nuclear]{.underline}. Sweden, by applying
for NATO membership, is hedging against future risks. After World War
II, Swedish policymakers discontinued the development of nukes due to
domestic constraints. But [the possibility of further Russian aggression
and the fear of American abandonment will]{.underline}
**[compel]{.underline}** [Sweden to resume its]{.underline} **[dormant
mission]{.underline}**.

[Kyiv\'s vulnerability]{.underline} **[is enough]{.underline}** [to
propel other states to pursue nuclear weapons as the]{.underline}
**[most strategic]{.underline}** [optimal choice for]{.underline}
**[self-preservation]{.underline}**. [Since nuclear weapons are
a]{.underline} "[defensive weapon]{.underline} **[par
excellence]{.underline}**", [Kyiv could have leveraged its nuclear
capability to]{.underline} **[blackmail]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}
[Russian regime]{.underline} into backing down. If Russia failed to
oblige, the threats of using nuclear weapons to inflict heavy damage on
the other side would have been enough to discourage Russian aggression.
[Such coercive nuclear tactics]{.underline} [are easily discernible in
the case of North Korea]{.underline}, which has not shied away from
invoking nuclear threats to achieve political objectives.
**[Today]{.underline}**, [the lack of security assurances from
NATO]{.underline} and the United States [might drive Kyiv to
find]{.underline} **[solace]{.underline}** [in nuclear weapons
while]{.underline} also **[emboldening]{.underline}** [other
states]{.underline} [like]{.underline} **[Japan]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[South Korea]{.underline}** [to follow
a]{.underline} **[similar strategy]{.underline}**.

Despite Ukraine's past decision to give up nuclear weapons, Kyiv may be
wondering now about the fallacy of such a decision. Bearing the brunt of
the invasion, Ukraine could have alerted Moscow by signaling its
reliance on nuclear weapons. If threatened states, as Vipin Narang
explained in his book Seeking the Bomb: Strategies of Nuclear
Proliferation, anticipate the plausibility of coercion from other
powers, they will pursue technical capabilities to develop a nuclear
weapon no matter the challenges involved. Further, [technological
constraints]{.underline} **[rarely obstruct]{.underline}** [a state's
pursuit of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. [States like
**Syria,**]{.underline} **[Taiwan]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[South Africa]{.underline}** all [tried to acquire nuclear
weapons]{.underline} **[clandestinely]{.underline}** [by generating the
necessary]{.underline} **[technical]{.underline}**
[capabilities]{.underline}. Others failed, but [South
Africa]{.underline} **[did succeed]{.underline}**. Nuclear weapons could
have forestalled Russian aggression.

The whole Russia-Ukraine crisis has caught Washington between a rock and
a hard place. [Washington will]{.underline} **[have to
navigate]{.underline}** [this geopolitical]{.underline}
**[tightrope]{.underline}** [cautiously]{.underline}. [Russian threats
have]{.underline} **[created anxiety]{.underline}** [in most
states]{.underline}, [demanding a]{.underline} **[more
credible]{.underline}** [commitment from the United States]{.underline}.
[While assurances may have mattered before, allies will now]{.underline}
**[demand]{.underline}** [more tangible commitments.]{.underline}
[Failing to do that will]{.underline} **[ensure]{.underline}** [greater
nuclear proliferation]{.underline} which may ensure peace but could also
be more menacing if not handled responsibly.

NUCLEAR DETERRENT AND ITS ROLE IN EUROPEAN SECURITY",
https://www.cer.org.uk/publications/archive/policy-brief/2021/bridging-channel-nuclear-deterrent)LR

[In March 2021, [the UK announced]{.mark} that [after]{.mark} [three
decades of reducing]{.mark} its [nuclear weapons]{.mark} stockpile, [the
number of nuclear warheads would begin to increase]{.mark}. The UK [also
reiterated]{.mark} its long-standing positions that all its nuclear
weapons would be [committed to NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} -- that is,
available for use at the request of NATO's Supreme Allied Commander
Europe (the alliance's most senior military commander); and that they
would only be used "in extreme circumstances of self-defence, including
the defence of our NATO Allies".1 [In other words, as during the Cold
War, [the UK accepts the possibility]{.mark}, however remote, [of
suffering a nuclear strike]{.mark} on its own territory in retaliation
for a British nuclear strike carried out in defence of other countries
that do not have their own nuclear weapons.]{.underline} [The UK's
European allies ought to be grateful for the UK's willingness to bear
such risks on their behalf.]{.underline} But it seems that not all of
them see this policy as credible. The UK has largely succeeded in
keeping its defence relationships with European allies separate from
Brexit-related tensions, but there are concerns among NATO partners
about future UK intentions towards the continent of Europe. Though UK
nuclear forces have been committed to NATO since the early 1960s, there
has been little debate in recent years about what that commitment means
in concrete terms, either in the UK or in allied countries. [That needs
to change: the [UK needs to show how its deterrent fits]{.mark} into
[Europe's]{.mark} [changing]{.mark} [security environment]{.mark}, [and
reassure]{.mark} its [allies]{.mark} that its commitment is not just
rhetorical.]{.underline} This paper explores how the UK thinks about its
nuclear weapons, both as the ultimate guarantee of its national security
and as components in NATO's deterrent posture; and how European allies
see the UK's nuclear deterrent, including in the context of Britain's
overall commitment to defending NATO territory. [It looks at the [roles
played by the UK and French deterrents]{.mark}. And it makes
recommendations for improving UK messaging on nuclear
issues.]{.underline} Despite the increased warhead ceiling, the main
principles of the UK's nuclear policy have not changed since the then
Labour government set them out in 2006, as part of the case for
procuring new submarines: The focus is on preventing nuclear attack. The
weapons are not designed for war-fighting. The UK will only retain the
minimum amount of destructive power needed to achieve its deterrence
objectives. [The bigger stockpile is said to reflect a changed
calculation of the number of warheads needed for that purpose. The UK
will maintain ambiguity about when, how and at what scale it might use
nuclear weapons]{.underline}. [In particular, it will not exclude the
first use of nuclear weapons. Except when (undefined) supreme national
interests are at stake, the UK's nuclear weapons will be used
exclusively for the defence of NATO.]{.underline}3 Most Western European
allies -- including those who operate aircraft carrying US nuclear bombs
-- are more focused on arms control than deterrence, and hope that
Biden's support for further nuclear negotiations with Russia will help
them to deal with domestic political opposition to the presence of US
nuclear weapons in Europe. Some of them face considerable domestic
pressure to sign up to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons
(TPNW -- which entered into force in January 2021). Norway, Slovenia and
the Netherlands were involved in various stages of the negotiation of
the treaty, though none ultimately signed it. The alliance, however,
issued a statement in December 2020 stating its opposition to the treaty
"as it does not reflect the increasingly challenging international
security environment".6 Despite this, the new Labour-led coalition
government in Norway has said that it will attend the next conference of
parties to the TPNW, while the Belgian coalition government that took
office in 2020 is committed to exploring how the treaty "can give new
impetus to multilateral nuclear disarmament".7 [As NATO works on its new
Strategic Concept, due to be adopted at a summit in 2022, these
differences among allies which want to reduce the role of nuclear
weapons in NATO and those that support a strong nuclear deterrent may
come to the fore.]{.underline} Complicating the debate on NATO's future
nuclear strategy [is [the parallel debate in the US]{.underline}]{.mark}
[on its national [nuclear posture review]{.mark}. The last review was
published in 2018, [under]{.mark} Donald [Trump]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} it
made [more explicit than]{.mark} the [Obama]{.mark} administration's
2010 review that [the US might use nuclear weapons first in a
conflict,]{.mark} in extreme circumstances which "could include
significant non-nuclear strategic attacks".15 Indeed, [the review firmly
rejected a shift to a 'no first use' policy]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
Biden administration is now engaged in its own nuclear posture review,
due to be completed in 2022. When he was running for office, Biden
argued that "the sole purpose of the US nuclear arsenal should be
deterring -- and, if necessary, retaliating against -- a nuclear attack"
-- a policy that the Obama administration said conditions did not allow
it to adopt in 2010.16 While such a policy would fall short of a full
commitment never to use nuclear weapons first, sought by some arms
control advocates, it would imply that an adversary could launch a
conventional attack with a high degree of confidence that the US would
not respond with nuclear weapons[. That [might win Biden
plaudits]{.mark} with the incoming German coalition and in some other
Western European countries, [but]{.mark} it would [add to a
perception]{.mark} in Poland and other parts of Central Europe that [the
US is disarming itself]{.mark}. America's allies in Europe and Asia --
including the UK and France -- are reportedly lobbying against any
change in US policy.17 The [UK]{.mark} has allowed discussion of the
nuclear section of the integrated review to focus almost entirely on the
increase in its warhead stockpile. But it [has the opportunity to
leverage its deterrent to reinforce security ties with its European
partners, provided it can get the messaging right]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The UK needs to ensure that its commitment to use its nuclear weapons to
deter and if necessary respond to attacks on its allies is understood
and believed by those most exposed to Russian pressure. This is partly a
matter of regularly putting it into speaking notes for high-level
contacts with Central and Eastern European foreign and defence
ministries, and partly a matter of outreach to the small number of
experts who follow nuclear issues in the region, to allay their concerns
about the UK's commitment.

[The [Ukraine]{.mark} war has further [entrenched]{.mark} and
exacerbated the geopolitical [rivalry between the West and the
Russia--China camp]{.mark}. This new \'Superpower Plus\' clash leaves
the so-called 'Rest' in a difficult position, with some countries
feeling pressure to choose sides, and others trying to remain
neutral.]{.underline} Worryingly, many are leaning closer to the
Russia--China position than the West. In the [2 March vote at the UN
General Assembly](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113152), 141
countries 'deplored the aggression' committed by Russia against Ukraine,
with five votes against (not surprisingly, these were Belarus, Eritrea,
North Korea, Syria and, of course, Russia). But 35 countries abstained,
indicating tacit support for Russia, and these votes came from across
the globe: from El Salvador to Equatorial Guinea to Namibia to Mongolia.
The abstainers also represent places that will be significantly impacted
by the negative spill-over from the war, whether in terms of food
scarcity, prohibitive energy prices, supply chain blockages or rising
inflation, which could lead to a global recession and new refugee flows.
[[Many in the Global South]{.mark} simply [do not share]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} sense of moral outrage and strategic [threat]{.mark} [that
is felt]{.mark} [in the Euro-Atlantic bubble]{.mark}. 'It's not our war,
it's a European problem' and 'what about the many conflicts on our
continent that you ignored?' [sums up the prevailing
mood](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/05/25/ukraine-sidelines-regional-not-global-conflict-00034793).]{.underline}
American and European governments preoccupied by maintaining a coalition
at the same time as handling pressing domestic issues have come late to
understanding the implications of this. While they congratulate
themselves on the tactical impact of weapons they are supplying to
Ukraine, Western powers are only now registering the strategic impact of
losing the battle between competing narratives. And this matters,
because the political and intellectual isolation of the West will serve
only to break apart an already fragile coalition into its parochially
minded constituent parts. [I[t will also leave the way open
for]{.underline}]{.mark} naked [[aggression to be
rewarded]{.underline}]{.mark}, and repeated. Significantly, it would
mark the reversion to an international system dominated by power blocs
and the inherent tensions that accompany this. The evidence for the loss
of the narrative battle is there in plain sight, especially among the
'Rest'. [Ukraine no longer dominates the news
agenda](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2022/perceptions-media-coverage-war-Ukraine),
and the recurring theme globally is a negotiated end to the conflict on
Russian terms, rather than the defeat of Russian forces. Perversely,
fighting in the south and east of Ukraine does not elicit the outrage
that the failed seizure of Kyiv provoked; indeed, it is in danger of
becoming normalised. At the same time, Russian accusations that the West
and NATO are responsible for the growing food crisis because of Western
sanctions are cutting through to audiences outside the Euro-Atlantic
bubble -- as is Russian leverage of the European colonial legacy,
casting the war in Ukraine as a struggle against NATO neo-imperialism.
News of Russian losses is filtering through to the Russian domestic
audience, and there is some evidence of reserves trying to avoid
military service. However, independent and usually reliable sources,
like the [Levada Center](http://www.levada.ru/), suggest support for the
war in Russia is running at over 80% of those polled. While conventional
news coverage globally is increasingly patchy, the Russian narrative
dominates discussion on a number of key social media platforms, at home
and internationally. The Russians have proven themselves adept at the
sort of disinformation techniques that mask war crimes and reframe them
as Ukrainian false flag attacks aimed at discrediting the Russian army.
While these tactics may look crude, they are capable of engaging
audiences that trust neither conventional media nor
government-sanctioned statements. Overall, Russia\'s leadership has
reason to feel confident that the 'Rest' is with them, as the West is
being subsumed by political chaos caused by inflation and the energy and
food crises, to the extent that it will eventually accept a compromise
solution dictated on Russian terms. [[The acceptance]{.mark} of such a
compromise could only be seen as a Russian victory, [which would change
the terms of]{.mark} strategic engagement between [the Russia--China
axis]{.mark}, the West and the \'Rest\',]{.underline} and perhaps
encourage the sort of adventurism of which the invasion of Ukraine has
been a seminal example. So, how is the West to regain the initiative in
the contest of narratives? Perhaps the first requirement is to recognise
the different audiences that need to be engaged and the different
messages that need to be conveyed to them. For the Euro-Atlantic
audience, the priority should be to counter the acceptability of a
forever war and seek a decisive outcome in the short term. For the
Russian audience, the challenge is how to widen the existing cracks in
civil society and attack the morale of the Russian army. For the
strategically decisive audience in the Global South, the focus should be
on exposing misinformation about the causes of the war, to constantly
restate Ukraine's legitimacy as an independent entity, and to reveal
Russia's culpability in the food crisis, along with its pervasive
attacks on civilians. This could include a reminder and amplification of
Kenyan Ambassador to the UN Martin Kimani's [warnings at a Security
Council
debate](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/22/1082334172/kenya-security-council-russia)
just days before the Russian invasion, when he decried Russian
recognition of the breakaway republics in the east of Ukraine, pointing
to his country's own experience with colonialism. The second
[[requirement is to figure out how this will be
achieved,]{.underline}]{.mark} which will need some innovative thinking.
First up is a reboot of Ukraine's strategic narrative. [The [current
script]{.mark} of heroic Ukrainians, [sustained by Western]{.mark}
logistic [support]{.mark}, out-thinking and out-fighting Russia [is
untenable]{.mark} in that it [implies]{.mark} a [s]{.mark}tatus
[quo]{.mark} that [can be maintained]{.mark} indefinitely. A new script
should identify the global consequences of the war -- energy, food and
economic crises -- and reject the appeasement that will only perpetuate
them. It will not be enough to rely on a traditional news-based
methodology to deliver this.]{.underline} The 'Rest', in particular,
consists of demographically young societies, and -- like the young
everywhere -- they do not consume information in traditional ways. To
tell Ukraine's story will require far smarter application of
user-generated material and ways of identifying the organic social
networks that share and spread them. In Africa, this will probably be
based around the ubiquity of mobile phone networks; in India, around
proliferating local wireless systems. And it will need to be done at
scale. The traditional and rather bespoke techniques of government
communication will need to borrow from the industrial heft and ambition
of corporate marketing if they are to deliver global effect. This might
take us in unexpected directions. For example, online games can promote
the organic development and sharing of compelling memes, tropes and
influencer commentary that has the feel of popular authenticity rather
than the manufactured texture of official statements. While gaming might
sound like a deeply improbable instrument of strategic communications,
it does provide a direct channel to gamers. Advertisers sell commercial
products by this route every day; why can't we communicate political
messages in the same way? It would be easy to dismiss the triviality of,
for example, TikTok, but considering the huge volume of user-generated
material it attracts, especially when content simply captures the
zeitgeist and goes viral, that is the effect we need to replicate.
Returning to more conventional methods of exerting influence, [[the one
country]{.mark} [that has]{.mark} fully [aligned with Russia --
China]{.mark} -- is also the one that has a clear opportunity to burnish
its credentials as a positive actor on the international stage, by
encouraging Russia in the direction of moderation.]{.underline} Not only
is [President [Xi]{.mark} Jinping [the only leader]{.mark} [Putin might
listen]{.mark} to, but he is also a voice guaranteed to resonate among
the 'Rest'[. Doing so would]{.mark} also significantly [improve
the]{.mark} current frosty [standoff between the US and China]{.mark},
and contribute to a course correction in relations. Only the Ukrainians
can decide when they will come to the negotiating table and what they
might be willing to concede -- a situation recognised and accepted by
Western governments. Those same Western governments can, however, go
some way to shaping the strategic context with more effective engagement
of the 'Rest', a constituency they neglect at their peril.]{.underline}
