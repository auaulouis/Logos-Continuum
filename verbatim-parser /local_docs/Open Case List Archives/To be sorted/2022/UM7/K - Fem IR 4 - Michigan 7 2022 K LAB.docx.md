### Alt d/n solve -- Genderless

#### Turn -- their analysis presumes of the state as a genderless agent -- the aff is key to reveal the state as a site of gendered performativity

[Wadley, 2010]{.underline}. (Jonathan, PhD in IR from Florida and
currently professor of IR and sexual politics at San Diego. "Gendering
the State: Performativity and Protection in International Security," in
*Gender and International Security* edited by Laura Sjoberg, pp. 40-41 -
spp)

[The analysis presented here challenges the discipline's tendency to
treat states as genderless persons by exploring the role of gender in
the security performances of states. In doing so, it draws upon the
concept of performativity -- the idea that]{.underline}, in the words of
Judith Butler, "[identity is performatively constituted by the very
'expression' that are said to be its results."]{.underline} It argues
that [performances within the field of security,]{.underline} much like
performances within the daily lives of people, [carry no intrinsic
meaning, but must be made sense of through "a system of symbolic
meaning" that cannot be but gendered. Through such performances,
identities become salient, and masculine and feminine subjects are
created.]{.underline} While this process is less palpable for states
than it is for humans, it is nonetheless observable in broad patterns.
[States can be observed reifying themselves through performances of
security, particularly through those which establish them as stable and
masculine protectors]{.underline}. Recent work on the politics of
protection, particularly that done by Didier Bigo, [suggests the
constitutive effects that protection has upon both providers and
recipients.]{.underline} It stops short, however, of recognizing that
these effects may be enabled by the gendered meaning that different
forms of protection carry. When such meanings are considered, it becomes
evident that [by "being" masculine protectors, states can position
themselves favorably in relation to other international actors and gain
legitimacy from their domestic audiences. This means that states are
gendered, and are gendered in much the same way as people are: through
repeated performances.]{.underline} When state identity is viewed in
this light, the anthropomorphic assumption, as it is commonly used,
appears woefully inadequate. To be clear, it is not being suggested that
drawing parallels between human subjects and state subjects is bad
in-and-of-itself. Indeed, useful parallels can be drawn, despite (or,
perhaps, because of) the notion that "both states and persons are fuzzy
sets." The [trouble lies in assuming that states, or people, are
constituted outside processes of interaction, and that either can be
made sense of without considering the relational identities they take on
through the systems of symbolic meaning through which they operate.
Anthropomorphic assumptions tend to treat the state as a genderless,
unitary actor -- often, one that is ontologically primitive to its
interactions -- while neglecting the ways that the "actor-ness" and
"unity" of the state are an effect of iterated, gendered performances,
particularly in the realm of security.]{.underline} By viewing security
performances with an eye toward their constitutive effects, and [by
moving gender to the center of that analysis, one gains not only a
richer understanding of how states reproduce themselves]{.underline}
(i.e. where their person-like "identities" come from), [but a clearer
picture of the hierarchical relations that exist among states and
between states and domestic populations.]{.underline} This chapter
begins with a consideration of how the state has been conceived of a
person throughout the discipline, arguing that such practices almost
always import an inadequate understanding of how people are constituted.
In both cases, conceptualizing states and conceptualizing humans -- this
is a result, largely, of substance-oriented, as opposed to
process-oriented, approaches. It argues [that by making processes,
rather than substances, the core of research, scholars will be able to
more fully explain how states reproduce themselves as actors in world
politics, how they garner power for themselves (in relation to other
international actors, particularly states), and how they gain legitimacy
from their subjects.]{.underline} Following that, the chapter argues
that [a theory of performativity can fill this need, especially in the
realm of Security Studies.]{.underline} Moreover, [such a theory would
facilitate the study of gender within these processes and shed light on
the incentives states have to behave as masculine actors.]{.underline}
The final section of the chapter offers, tentatively, a way for
empirical research to bear on the theoretical sketches presented here.
It submits that "the rational protector model" may be examined as a type
of dominant masculinity for states, one which allows them to "do"
security ways that cast them as unitary, masculine actors.

### Marxism = Sex-Blind

**Marxism is sex blind**

T**[he \"marriage\" of marxism and feminism has been like the marriage
husband and wife depicted in English common law: marxism and feminism
are one, and that one is Marxism.]{.underline}** **[Recent attempts to
integrate marxism and feminism are unsatisfactory to us as feminists
because they subsume the femi­nist struggle into the \"larger\" struggle
against capi­tal.]{.underline}** To continue our simile further, either
we need a healthier marriage or we need a divorce. The inequalities in
this marriage, like most social phenomena, are no accident. **[Many
marxists typical­ly argue that feminism is at best less important than
class conflict and at worst divisive of the working class. This
political stance produces an analysis that absorbs feminism into the
class struggle]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[the analytic power of
marxism with respect to capital has obscured its limitations with
respect to sexism.]{.underline}** We will argue here that while marxist
analysis provides essential insight into the laws of historical
develop­ment, and those of capital in particular, **[the categories of
marxism are sex-blind.]{.underline}** **[Only a specifically feminist
analysis reveals the systemic character of relations between men and
women.]{.underline}** Yet feminist analysis by itself is inadequate
because it has been blind to his­tory and insufficiency materialist.
**[Both Marxist anal­ysis, particularly its historical and materialist
method, and feminist analysis, especially the identification of
patriarchy as a social and historical structure, must be drawn upon if
we are to understand the development of western capitalist societies and
the predicament of women within them]{.underline}**. In this essay we
suggest a new direction for marxist feminist analysis. I MARXISM AND THE
WOMAN QUESTION The woman question has never been the \"femi­nist
question.\" **[The feminist question is directed at the causes of sexual
inequality between women and men, of male dominance over women. Most
marxist analyses of women\'s position take as their question the
relationship of women to the eco­nomic system, rather than that of women
to men, apparently assuming the latter will be explained in their
discussion of the former. Marxist analysis]{.underline}** of the woman
question has taken three main forms. All **[see women\'s oppression .in
our connection]{.underline}** (or lack of it) **[to
production]{.underline}**, **[Defining women as part of the working
class, these analyses consistently subsume women\'s relation to men
under worker\'s relation to capital]{.underline}**. First, early
marxists, including Marx, Engels, Kautsky, and Lenin, saw capitalism
drawing, all women into the wage labor force, and saw this process
destroying the sexual division, of labor. Second, contemporary marxists
have incor­porated, women into an analysis of evervdav life in
capitalism. In this view, all aspects of our lives are seen to reproduce
the capitalist system and we are all workers in the system. And third,,
marxist femi­nists have focused on housework and its relation to capital,
some arguing that housework produces surplus value and that houseworkers
work directly for capitalists. . . . While the approach of the early
marxists ignored housework and stressed women\'s labor force
par­ticipation, the two more recent approaches em­phasize housework to
such an extent they ignore women\'s current role in the labor market.
Never­theless, **[all three attempt to include women in the category
working class and to understand women\'s oppression as another aspect of
class oppression]{.underline}**. **[In doing so all give short shrift to
the object of feminist analysis, the relations between women and
men.]{.underline}** **[While our \"problems\" have been elegantly
analyzed, they have been misunderstood]{.underline}**. The focus of
Marxist analysis has been class relations; the object of marxist
analysis has been understanding the laws of motion of capitalist
society. While we be­lieve marxist methodology can be used to formulate
feminist strategy, these marxist feminist approaches discussed above
clearly do not do so; their marxism clearly dominates their feminism.
Marxism enables us to understand many as­pects of capitalist societies:
the structure of pro­duction, the generation of a particular occupational
structure, and the nature of the dominant ideology. **[Marx\'s theory of
the development of capitalism is a theory of the development of \"empty
places.\"]{.underline}** Marx predicted, for example, the growth of the
proletariat and the demise of the petit bourgeoisie. More pre­cisely and
in more detail, Braverman among others has explained the creation of the
\"places\" clerical worker and service worker in advanced capitalist
societies.2 **[Just as capital creates these places indifferent to the
individuals who fill them, the cat­egories of marxist analysis, class,
reserve army of labor, wage laborer, do not explain why particular
people, fill particular places. They give no clues about why women are
subordinate to men inside and outside the family and why it is not the
other way around.]{.underline}** **[Marxist categories, like capital
itself, are sex-blind. The categories of Marxism cannot tell us who will
fill the empty places. Marxist analysis of the woman question has
suffered from this basic problem.]{.underline}**

### Marxism Fails

#### Marxist strategies fail--- subjectivity reformations like the aff are key in a world that has moved to neoliberalism

**Oksala 15** Johanna Oksala is currently Academy of Finland Research
Fellow (2012-2017) in the Department of Philosophy, History, Culture and
Art Studies at the University of Helsinki, and a Visiting Professor in
the Department of Philosophy at the New School for Social Research, USA

rishi

It is my contention **[that Foucault's "post-Marxist" insights about the
intrinsic link between productive practices of power and forms of the
subject must remain central in our critical analyses of the neoliberal
turn. While in many Marxist accounts neoliberalism is understood simply
as an intensification of capitalist exploitation, which is heightening
the fundamental class antagonism between capitalists and laborers, from
a Foucauldian perspective it must be understood as a new configuration
of power relations that produces new forms of the
subject]{.underline}**. We have to recognize the historically specific
ways that the instability and the persistent crises of capitalism have
been negotiated in recent decades through neoliberal forms of
governmentality -- new political technologies of power and social
regulation. Many socialist writers have lamented that the retreat from
class analysis in the academy in the eighties and nineties was one of
neoliberalism's most effective weapons because it prevented
class-consciousness from developing as the appropriate response to the
rise of
neoliberalism.[\[3\]](http://theoryculturesociety.org/johanna-oksala-on-foucault-marx-and-neoliberal-subjects/#_ftn3)
While the spread of neoliberalism is clearly inseparable from the
structural logic of capitalist accumulation**[, to view the subjects it
produces simply as class subjects who lack the appropriate consciousness
of their situation is nevertheless problematic i]{.underline}**n my
view. While it is important to acknowledge that in his lectures on
neoliberalism, The Birth of Biopolitics(2008), Foucault describes
technologies and rationalities rather than their actual empirical
outcomes, **[empirical and experiential evidence gives weight to the
theoretical claim that the neoliberal reorganization of Western
societies has resulted in new forms of the subject -- a new
understanding of ourselves. Social volatility and economic risks have
become increasingly central for profit making and the financialization
of everyday life requires new kinds of subjects and social
networks]{.underline}** (Floyd 2009, 196). Neoliberal governmentality
has dramatically extended the reach of the markets **[and market
rationality]{.underline}** and thereby produced the corresponding
subjects who are compelled to behave as market actors -- consumers,
individual investors and entrepreneurs -- across several dimensions of
their lives. As Foucault shows**[, neoliberal techniques scramble the
traditional opposition between capitalists and workers in the sense that
subjects are increasingly conceived and conceive themselves as
entrepreneurs of the self, who attempt to maximize their "human
capital]{.underline}**". Whether we focus on the reforms of pension
plans and healthcare, revisions of copyright laws or the restructuring
of universities, **[we are increasingly required to view ourselves as
market-actors and to behave
accordingly]{.underline}**.[\[4\]](http://theoryculturesociety.org/johanna-oksala-on-foucault-marx-and-neoliberal-subjects/#_ftn4)
These new forms of governmentality and social regulation are
misrecognized insofar as they are identified as "merely" cultural or
superstructural.[\[5\]](http://theoryculturesociety.org/johanna-oksala-on-foucault-marx-and-neoliberal-subjects/#_ftn5)
The historically specific practices of power in which we must engage
daily in order to go about our lives are not just symbolic, cultural or
discursive practices as Foucault's Marxist critics sometimes claim.
**[They are essentially material, social and economic practices that are
organized through neoliberal rationality and embedded in law and
political institutions, but also in everyday social
relationships.]{.underline}** Hence, **[we are not confronted merely
with ideological fiction that could be dispelled through the development
of appropriate class-consciousness; we are confronted with a new kind of
social reality.]{.underline}** What the Foucauldian analysis of
neoliberalism downplays in my view, however, is the necessary "failures"
of neoliberal governmentality to constitute entrepreneurial subjects --
the neoliberal constitution of "others". The obstacles in the way of
developing class consciousness are also "objective" in the second sense
that we are witnessing other, radically new forms of subjectivation that
are brought about by the global, neoliberal turn: the unemployed and the
undocumented subjects, **[as well as the neocolonial, disposable
subjects of the global South.]{.underline}** It is widely acknowledged
by numerous socialist writers that the composition of the workforce has
dramatically changed in the last decades due to the globalization and
neoliberalization of our economies. The industrial working class has
been shrinking in all Western countries at a rapid rate, and has been
largely replaced by post-industrial, service-sector workers, who are
largely female and in part-time or precarious employment. Instead of
social relations based on relatively stable forms of wage-labor, the
growth of insecurity and negative flexibilization have come to
increasingly characterize all work. Moreover, **[the majority of the
poorest and the most oppressed people in the world today are not
wage-laborers. They are people who have to eke out a precarious
existence in the informal economy because capitalism appears to have no
use for them at all.]{.underline}** In other words, **[the forms of
exploitation have not only assumed radically new forms, but it has
become increasingly unclear what the class relations are and how we are
situated in their intersections. It is imperative to also theorize these
new forms of the subject and the political potential they hold for
radical social transformation. That requires acknowledging the limits of
both Foucault's analysis of neoliberalism, as well as traditional
Marxist class analysis, and moving beyond them.]{.underline}**

### AT: Root Cause - Defense

#### Cap can't explain all gendered violence

**Rubin 1975** (Gayle, Professor of Sociology at the University of
Michigan, one of the foundational figures in modern gender theory and
well-honed reader of Marx, "The Traffic in Women...")

Given the individual, the production of labour-power consists in his
reproduction of himself or his maintenance. For his main-tenance he
requires a given quantity of the means of subsistence\.... Labour-power
sets itself in action only by working. But thereby a definite quantity
of human muscle, brain, nerve, etc., is wasted, and these require to be
restored\.... (Ibid.:171) [The amount of the difference between the
reproduction of labor power and its products depends, therefore, on the
de-termination of what it takes to reproduce that labor power. Marx
tends to make that determination on the basis of the quantity of
commoditie]{.underline}s---food, clothing, housing, fuel---which would
be necessary to maintain the health, life, and strength of a worker. But
these commodities must be con-sumed before they can be sustenance, and
they are not imme-diately in consumable form when they are purchased by
the wage. Additional labor must be performed upon these things before
they can be turned into people. Food must be cooked, clothes cleaned,
beds made, wood chopped, etc. Housework is therefore a key element in
the process of the reproduction of the laborer from whom surplus value
is taken. [Since it is usually women who do housework, it has been
observed that it is through the reproduction of labor power that women
are articulated into the surplus value nexus which is the sine qua non
of capitalism. But to explain women\'s usefulness to capi-talism is one
thing. To argue that this usefulness explains the genesis of the
oppression of women is quite another. It is precisely at this point that
the analysis of capitalism ceases to explain very much
about]{.underline} women and [the oppression of women. Women are
oppressed in societies which can by no stretch of the imagination be
described as capitalist.]{.underline} In the Amazon valley and the New
Guinea highlands, women are frequently kept in their place by gang rape
when the ordinary mecha-nisms of masculine intimidation prove
insufficient. \"We tame our women with the banana,\" said one Mundurucu
man (Murphy, 1959:195[). The ethnographic record is littered with
practices whose effect is to keep women \"in their place\" ---men\'s
cults, secret initiations, arcane male knowledge,]{.underline} etc. And
[pre-capitalist,]{.underline} feudal [Europe was hardly a society in
which there was no sexism. Capitalism has]{.underline} taken over, and
[rewired, notions of male and female which predate it by
centuries.]{.underline} No analysis of the reproduction of labor power
under capitalism can explain foot-binding, chastity belts, or any of the
incredible array of Byzantine, fetishized indignities, let alone the
more ordinary ones, which have been inflicted upon women in various
times and places. [The analysis of the reproduction of labor power does
not even explain why it is usually women who do domestic work in the
home, rather than men.]{.underline}

### AT: Root Cause - Offense

#### Hegemonic masculinity was a precondition to the universalization of liberal economic subjectivity

**Burke 2002.** (Anthony, School of Political Science and International
Studies, University of Queensland, Alternatives: Global, Local,
Political 27.1, InfoTrac OneFile)

These insights have direct relevance to the international conduct of
states. Christine Sylvester has argued that [there is a pernicious
\"normativity of sex\" structuring international relations,]{.underline}
while Tickner argues that statecraft is dominated by an image of
\"hegemonic masculinity\" that is \"sustained through its opposition to
various subordinated and devalued masculinities such as homosexuality .
. . and through its relation to various devalued feminities.\" In
international policy, [the characteristics of hegemonic masculinity
\"are projected onto the behaviour of states whose success as
international actors is measured in terms of their power capabilities
and capacity for self-help and autonomy.\"]{.underline} (53) [What this
achieves is a whole series of exclusions (and norms of action) based on
the dichotomy between masculine and feminine. This generates a chain of
analogous oppositions that align maleness with reason, activity,
objective truth, and the mind, and woman with passion, passivity,
subjective truth, and the body\--realms and values constructed as
perpetually threatening, backward, and disruptive]{.underline}. By then
aligning these with two other crucial dichotomies\--between savage and
civilized, and the commonwealth and the state of nature\--this chain of
oppositions gives life to the progressive movement of being central to a
post-Enlightenment politics of security. [In the liberal chain that
links subjectivity, economy, and geopolitics, gender is simultaneously a
work on the self, a principle for the participation of individuals in
society, and one for the conduct of the state in managing subject
populations and constructing geopolitical space.]{.underline} [Hegemonic
masculinity has]{.underline} also [been crucial to universalizing the
liberal mode of economic subjectivity based around the subjugation,
control, and exploitation of nature\--with the implicit exclusion of
other possible modes of economic life.]{.underline} (54) [A pivotal
figure here is Descartes, whose philosophical account of method and the
division between mind and body has underpinned many characteristics of
the modern liberal order: its obsession with political and
epistemological certitude (stability and equilibrium), the vision of
nature implicit in modern economics, and the control and production of
international space. Genevieve Lloyd emphasizes how the separation of
mind and body was essential to his vision of a \"unitary pure thought\"
t hat secured the foundations of modern science, yet simultaneously
separated it from the rest of life. Lloyd also draws out the links
between Cartesian method and Hegel\'s association of male attainments
with universality.]{.underline} [Maleness becomes a technical attribute
achieved by breaking away from the nature associated with woman, and
thus analogous to modern theories of technological, political, and
economic progress based on the manipulation and control of
nature.]{.underline} (55)

### Perm

#### **Double bind -- either the aff is a DA to the alt, or the aff is included and you vote for the perm: Capitalism relies on gendered hierarchies, means the aff is key**

**Griffin, 2015**. (Penny, Senior Lecturer in International Relations at
the University of New South Wales, Australia. "crisis, austerity and
gendered governance: a feminist perspective," in *feminist review* 109:
49-72, spp)

This paper draws upon, and seeks to extend, existing feminist analyses
of the causes, constitution and effects of financial crisis to argue
that crisis, governance and austerity are best understood by
interpreting the discursive reproduction of crisis governance discourses
and their feminist Frankenstein creation, what this paper refers to as
'crisis governance feminism'. [Existing feminist scholarship has, at
length, detailed how capitalism, in all its forms and at macro, micro,
local, regional and global levels, is gendered]{.underline}. Feminists
have contested the seductively clean and unified agenda of 'one world'
future prosperity lovingly perpetuated by neo-liberalism and its
advocates and have highlighted instead 'the messy, contradictory and
disjointed processes of global restructuring that have monopolised the
politics of development in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries'
(Griffin, 2010a: 91). Feminists have analysed and campaigned on economic
crises extensively, interrogating the gendered impacts of the 1980s debt
crisis (see, e.g., Sen and Grown, 1987; Benería, 2003), the East Asian
crisis (Truong, 1999; Ling, 2004; Floro et al., 2009; Seguino, 2009) and
the Argentine crisis (Chrabolowsky, 2003; De Cicco, 2011). F[eminist
discussions of global finance and crisis have displayed in stark relief
the gendered injustices and inequalities created and sustained by
various crises, the 'retrogression of individual
capabilities']{.underline} (Fukuda- Parr et al., 2013: 24),
[particularly those of women, created by financial crises, the social
costs to women of austerity and the organisational manipulations of
gender rhetoric that reaffirm existent and unequal economic policies and
power relations]{.underline} (see, e.g., Montgomerie and Young, 2010;
Roberts and Soederberg, 2012; Fukuda- Parr et al., 2013). As feminist
analyses have so convincingly argued, [ignorance of the local and social
constitution of global processes leads only to flawed scholarship and
ignorant policy-making that further exacerbate, or even create,
hierarchies and inequalities of labour, class, gender and sexual
relations. For feminists, regimes of capitalist production and
consumption are always gendered. The reproduction of assumptions of
individualism, market economics and democracy, perpetuated by
neo-liberal governance mechanisms as pre-given and beyond question,
mean, in particular, that neo-liberalism and its advocates have often
failed to recognise that 'the commercialisation of everyday life and of
all sectors of the economy generates social dynamics that many
individuals and cultures across the globe might find
repulsive']{.underline} (Benería, 2003: 73).

#### **The perm is key -- centering gender in discourse analysis is essential to check against the universalizing discourse of the alt**

**Griffin, 2015**. (Penny, Senior Lecturer in International Relations at
the University of New South Wales, Australia. "crisis, austerity and
gendered governance: a feminist perspective," in *feminist review* 109:
49-72, spp)

Adding to this extensive body of feminist literature, this paper
interrogates crisis governance as discursively gendered, and the effects
of this. [A discursive approach is significant because it does not
assume,]{.underline} as per liberal approaches, a foundational economic
rationality to economic strategy, or, [as per Marxism, the central truth
of class struggle as universal. A discursive approach that centralises
gender in understanding the reproduction of crisis governance discourses
under- stands governance and its outcomes as a complex amalgamation of
meaning and practice, founded by and reproduced through culturally
produced and pervasively gendered ideas, assumptions and values about
the world.]{.underline} A commitment to non- essentialism challenges, at
fundamental and unsettling levels, some of the core categories of
conventional forms of analysis. [This contrasts with]{.underline}
mainstream (international political economy) scholarship's framing of
human behaviour in terms of faceless, desocialised units of analysis and
its reproduction of a model of society as a self-regulating machine
explainable by scientific laws adapted from modern philosophy and
Newtonian science. It also contrasts with critical scholar- ship's
preference for [the Marxist view of economic relations as
(pre)determined by the nature of class struggle. While some materialist
(feminist) approaches articulate women's disprivilege as a historical
constant and something of a cultural given, discourse analysis of
gendered governance, instead, understands privilege, discrimination and
inequality as socially, and culturally, produced and variable across
time and place, resisting the rooting of economic relations in class
relations and showing a greater interest in the gendered cultural
practices]{.underline} (including gendered recruitment and promotion
practices, discriminatory forms of lending, gendered assessments of
credit worthiness and so on) [that enable the reproduction of gendered
power in the global political economy. A discursive approach to gender
and governance necessitates the analysis of norms and standards in the
global political economy that many hold to be true, essential and
universal, but a committed critique of which reveals as power-laden,
regulatory and highly restrictive identity categories]{.underline}
(Griffin, 2009: 1[). Rather than positing the primacy of 'the economic',
which swallows whole concepts such as culture, gender, race, production,
consumption and representation, this paper looks to the cultural
conditions of embodiments of capitalism, specifically neo- liberal
global governance and the discourses of governance that neo-liberalism
reproduces]{.underline}. To be sure, these discourses emanate from
various and diverse actors, institutions, organisations and initiatives,
including individual (state) governments and groupings of these (such as
the G7 and G10); supra-national bureaucracies such as the European Union
(EU); intergovernmental organisations such as the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the UN; non-governmental
organisations such as the World Economic Forum (WEF); and private
financial governance initiatives (which are not available for public
scrutiny) such as those instituted by the Bank for International
Settlements and the International Organization of Securities
Commissions. [By asking us to confront in quite radical and imaginative
ways how we know what we think we know and thus what we exclude from our
analyses, a discursive research strategy is always strongly
political.]{.underline}

### Vulnerability DA

#### Vulnerability DA---the alt fails because it doesn't cultivate an ethic vulnerability -- only the aff can cultivate safe educational spaces that are based in care and respect for each other

environmental and the social.\" Canadian Journal of Environmental
Education (CJEE) 15 (2011): 120-134. rishi

[Those advocating for ecofeminist pedagogy emphasize the role of
dialogue in enacting new relationships between humans, and between
humans and morethan- human nature]{.underline} (Gardner & Riley, 2007;
Houde & Bullis, 1999; Li, 2007). [[Genuine
dialogue]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to Buber (1965), [[is like an
embrace]{.mark}, a moment when two come together and, without loss of
self, are able to hold each other simultaneously [with an open heart and
mind]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[It is built on respect and a deep sense
of the intrinsic value of the other being]{.underline}**.]{.mark} This
is a relation of the both/and, an acknowledgment of the immediate
presence of both deep interdependence and the unique autonomy of each
[being. This is a relationship held together by humility]{.underline}.
Blenkinsop (2005) proposes **[that a teacher who is prepared to engage
in dialogue with students will push, support, and challenge students in
whatever direction he/she feels will be most helpful for the
student,]{.underline}** [while at the same time acknowledging that
students respond out of their own free]{.underline} **[will. [When
ecofeminists speak of transformed relationships, they are presupposing
that these relationships are based on an acknowledgement of human
interdependence with each other and the rest of
nature]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Merchant, 2005; Warren, 2000). Kheel
(1993) suggests that [[disengaging from patriarchal discourse allows us
to hear fuller stories as we listen to nature]{.underline}, **[hearing
voices that have been muted under patriarchy]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
[Ecofeminists seek,]{.underline} in Buber's language[, for [authentic
dialogue based on respect for, and communion with, other
beings]{.mark}]{.underline}. Clearly [an ecofeminist pedagogy calls for
a radical relational shift in education: a shift towards something that
is more dialogical, where the human]{.underline} (teacher and student),
[the community, and the more-than-human come together and engage with
each other in more robust and equitable ways than is currently the
norm.]{.underline} **[This is a pedagogy where learning takes place in a
more expanded, including outdoor, environment in which students can
experience relationship and build community between themselves, their
locale, and the rest of nature.]{.underline}** This shift in both the
place of education and the definition of and relationship between
teacher and learner allows the natural world space to play the more
prominent role of active dialoguer, even co-teacher, in an educational
practice that is in, for, and through relationship. [[This notion of
authentic dialogue, along with both a growing implicit thread of
experiential education, and a critical philosophical stance, are three

#### Double Bind: Either A) The alt doesn't solve the K because anti-blackness is inevitable within the pessimist frame, and we win because only we have unique offense; or B) The alternative double turns the K because their solvency claim is cruel optimism

[[The effort to examine the event of emancipation is no less riddled by
inescapable]{.underline}¶ [ironies]{.underline}]{.mark}[, the foremost
of these being the discontinuity between -substantial
freedom]{.underline}¶ [and legal emancipation]{.underline}. [Inevitably
[one is forced to confront the discrepant legacy
of]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶ [emancipation and the decidedly circumscribed
possibilities available to the freed]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline}
In¶ short, how does one adequately render the double bind of
emancipation-that is,¶ acknowledge the illusory freedom and travestied
liberation that succeeded chattel¶ slavery without gainsaying the small
triumphs of Jubilee? Certainly one must contend¶ with the enormity of
emancipation as both a breach with slavery and a point of¶ transition to
what looks more like the reorganization of the plantation system than¶
self-possession, citizenship, or liberty for the \"freed.\" In the place
of the grand¶ narrative of freedom, with its decisive events and
incontrovertible advances, I offer¶ an account that focuses on the
ambivalent legacy of emancipation and the undeniably¶ truncated
opportunities available to the freed. [[Lacking the certitude of a
definitive]{.underline}¶ [partition between slavery and
freedom]{.underline}]{.mark}[, and in the absence of a
consummate]{.underline}¶ [breach through which freedom might
unambivalently announce itself, [there is at best]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶
[a transient and fleeting expression of possibility that cannot ensconce
itself as a]{.underline}¶ [durable temporal marker. If periodization is
a barrier imposed from above that]{.underline}¶ [obscures the
involuntary servitude and legal subjection that followed in the wake
of]{.underline}¶ [slavery, then attempts to assert absolutist
distinctions between slavery and freedom]{.underline}¶ [are
untenable.]{.underline}]{.mark} Fundamentally, [[such]{.mark}
[assertions]{.mark}]{.underline} involve distinctions between the
transient¶ and the epochal, [[underestimate the contradictory
inheritance of emancipation]{.underline}]{.mark}¶ and the forms of
involuntary servitude that followed in the wake of slavery[,
[and]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶ [diminish the reign of terror that
accompanied the advent of freedom.]{.underline}]{.mark} Put
differently,¶ does the momentousness of emancipation as an event
ultimately efface the continuities¶ between slavery and freedom and the
dispossession inseparable from becoming¶ a \"propertied person\"? If one
dares to \"abandon the absurd catalogue of official¶ history,\" as
Edouard Glissant encourages, then the violence and domination
perpetuated¶ in the name of slavery\'s reversal come to the fore. 1•
From this vantage¶ point, [[emancipation seems a double-edged and
perhaps obfuscating label. It discloses]{.underline}¶ [as well as
obscures]{.underline}]{.mark} since involuntary servitude and
emancipation were synonymous¶ for a good many of the formerly enslaved.
This is evidenced in \"commonsense\"¶ observations that black lives were
more valuable under slavery than under¶ freedom, that blacks were worse
off under freedom than during slavery, and that the¶ gift of freedom was
a Hhard deaL\" I use the tenn \"\'common sense\" purposely to¶ underline
what Antonio Gramsci described as the \"chaotic aggregate of disparate¶
conceptions\" that conform with \"the social and cultural position of
those masses¶ whose philosophy it is.\" It is a conception of world and
life \"implicit to a large¶ extent in determinate strata of society\"
and \"in opposition to \'official\' conceptions¶ of the world. \" 20 In
this case, common sense challenges the official accounts of¶ freedom and
stresses the similarities and correspondencies of slavery and freedom.¶
At a minimum, these observations disclose the disavowed transactions
between¶ slavery and freedom as modes of production and subjection.¶
[[The abolition of chattel slavery and the emergence of man]{.mark},
however laudable,]{.underline}¶ [long awaited, and cherished, [fail to
yield such absolute distinctions]{.mark}]{.underline}; instead
fleeting,¶ disabled, and short-lived practices stand for freedom and its
failure. Everyday practices,¶ rather than traditional political activity
like the abolition movement, black¶ conventions, the struggle for
suffrage, electoral activities, et cetera, are the focus of¶ my
examination because I believe that these pedestrian practices illuminate
inchoate¶ and utopian expressions of freedom that are not and perhaps
cannot be actualized¶ elsewhere. The desires and longings that exceed
the frame of civil rights and¶ political emancipation find expression in
quotidian acts labeled \"fanciful,\" \"exorbitant,\"¶ and \"excessive\"
primarily because they express an understanding or¶ imagination of
freedom quite at odds with bourgeois expectations. Paul Gilroy, after¶
Seyla Benhabib, refers to these utopian invocations and the incipient
modes of¶ friendship and solidarity they conjure up as \"the politics of
transfiguration. \"21 He¶ notes that in contrast to the politics of
fulfillment that operate within the framework¶ of bourgeois civil
society and occidental rationality, \"the politics of transfiguration¶
strives in pursuit of the sublime, struggling to repeat the
unrepeatable, to present the¶ unpresentable. Its rather different
hermeneutic focus pushes towards the mimetic,¶ dramatic and
performative.\" From this perspective, stealing away, the breakdown,¶
moving about, pilfering, and other everyday practices that occur below
the threshold¶ of formal equality and rights gesture toward an
unrealized freedom and emphasize¶ the stranglehold of slavery and the
limits of emancipation. In this and in other ways,¶ these practices
reveal much about the infrapolitics of the dominated and the
contestations¶ over the meaning of abolition and emancipation.

### Turn -- Indebtedness

#### Turn -- the aff's investment in the ballot as a recognition of their personhood invokes the logic that a loss signifies the denial of black personhood -- this lends the liberal notion that black people are responsible to prove themselves subjects, which in turns places the black in a position of blameworthiness and indebtedness. This legitimizes the commodification of the black body and turns the case

[Hartman 1997]{.underline}. (Saidiya, Associate prof of English at Cal
Berk. *Scenes of Subjection* p. 125-6)

[[Emancipation announced the end of chattel slavery;]{.mark} [however,
it by no]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶ [means marked the end of bondage. The
free(d) individual was nothing if not]{.underline}
]{.mark}[burdened,]{.underline}¶ [[responsible]{.mark}, and obligated.
[Responsibility]{.mark} [entailed]{.mark} [accounting for
one\'s]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶ [actions]{.underline}]{.mark}[, dutiful
suppliance, contractual obligation, [and]{.mark} [calculated]{.mark}
[reciprocit]{.mark}]{.underline}[y]{.mark}. Fundamentally,¶ [[to be
responsible was to be blameworthy]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this respect,
the exercise of¶ free will, quite literally, was inextricable from
guilty infractions, criminal misdeeds,¶ punishable transgressions, and
an elaborate micropenality of everyday life.
[[Responsibility]{.underline}¶ [made man an end in
himself]{.underline}]{.mark}[, [and]{.mark} as such, the autonomous and
intending agent]{.underline}¶ [was above all else
[culpable]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Friedrich Nietzsche observed: \"The
proud realization¶ of the extraordinary privilege of responsibility, the
awareness of this rare¶ freedom and power over himself and his destiny,
has penetrated him to the depths and¶ become an instinct, his dominant
instinct: what will he call his dominant instinct,¶ assuming that he
needs a word for it? No doubt about the answer: this sovereign man¶
calls it his conscience.\'\' 1 [In this regard, [the burden of
conscience attendant to the]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶ [formation of the
sovereign individual was decisive not only in the ways that
it]{.underline}¶ [facilitated self-disciplining but also in its ability
to engender resentment toward and]{.underline}¶ [justify the punishment
of those who fell below \"the threshold of
responsibility\"]{.underline}]{.mark} [or]{.underline}¶ [failed to
achieve the requisite degree of self-control]{.underline}. 2 [[The onus
of accountability that]{.underline}¶ [rested upon the shoulders of the
self-responsible individual-the task of proving]{.underline}¶ [oneself
worthy of freedom]{.underline}]{.mark}-combined with the undue hardships
of emancipation¶ engendered an anomalous condition betwixt and between
slavery and freedom, for in¶ this case the individual was not only
tethered by the bonds of conscience and duty and¶ obliged by the ascetic
imperatives of restraint and self-reliance but also literally¶
constrained within a mixed-labor system in which contract was the
vehicle of servitude¶ and accountability was inseparable from peonage.
Moreover, the guilty volition¶ enjoyed by the free agent bore an uncanny
resemblance to the only form of agency¶ legally exercised by the
enslaved-that is, criminal liability.¶ Responsibility and restraint all
too easily yielded to a condition of involuntary¶ servitude, and
[[culpability]{.mark}. [inevitably gave way to
indebtedness]{.mark}.]{.underline} The emergence¶ of what I term
\"indebted servitude\" is the subject of this chapter. 1 use the¶ term
\"indebted servitude\" to amplify the constraints of conscience
(discipline internalized¶ and lauded as a virtue), the coercion and
compulsion of the free labor¶ system, and the \'\'grafting of morality
onto economics\'\' in the making of the dutiful¶ free laborer and
similarly lo illuminate the elasticity of debt in effecting peonage and¶
other forms of involuntary servitude.\' According to Nietzsche, the
feelings of guilt,¶ obligation, and responsibility originated in the
relations\~ip of creditor and debtor;¶ moreover, debt as the measure of
morality sanctions the \'imposition of punishment;¶ debt serves to
reinscribe both servitude and the pained constitution of blackness. 4 A¶
telling example of this calculation of conscience or the entanglement of
debt and¶ duty can be found in Jared Bell Waterbury\'s Advice to a Young
Christian. Here the¶ duty of self-examination is compared to
bookkeeping: \"Let the duty \[of selfexamination\]¶ be duly and
thoroughly performed, and we rise to the standard of the¶ skilful fsicJ
and prudent merchant, who duly records every ilem of business; who¶
never closes his counting-house until his balance sheet is made up\~ and
who, by a¶ single reference, can tell the true state of his accounts,
and form a correct esti1nate of¶ his co1nmercial standing. \"5 In the
case of the freed, [[the cultivation of conscience]{.underline}¶
[operated in the whip\'s stead]{.underline}]{.mark} [as an overseer of
the soul, although the use of compulsion]{.underline}¶ [was routinely
employed against those seemingly remiss in their duties.]{.underline} As
it¶ turned out[, [the encumbrance of freedom made one not only
blameworthy and vulnerable]{.underline}¶ [to
hardship]{.underline}]{.mark} [and affliction in the name of interest
[but]{.mark} also, surprisingly, [no]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶ [less
susceptible to the correctives of coercion and
constraint.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### Ballot Turn

#### Turn -- the ballot is offered to the judge to take pleasure in the suffering of the black body. The investment in the ballot is dependent on the notion of the black body as fungible -- makes anti-blackness worse

[Hartman 1997]{.underline}. (Saidiya, Associate prof of English at Cal
Berk. *Scenes of Subjection* p. 25-6)

[Rankin was not alone in his desire to slip into blackness and
experience the]{.underline}¶ [suffering of slavery \"firsthand,\" so to
speak]{.underline}. On the contrary[, [the popularity
of]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶ [Uncle Tom\'s Cabin and The Octoroon indicates
the willingness of others to suffer,]{.underline}¶
[too]{.underline}.]{.mark} The elasticity of blackness and its capacious
affects enabled such flights and¶ becomings. Moreover, in this case[,
[the figurative capacities of blackness and the]{.underline}¶
[fungibility of the commodity are directly linked. The fungibility of
the commodity,]{.underline}¶ [specifically its abstractness and
immateriality, enabled the black body]{.underline}]{.mark} [or
blackface]{.underline}¶ [mask [to serve as the vehicle of white
self-exploration, renunciation, and enjoyment]{.mark}.]{.underline}¶ 22
Therefore, [[the ability to put on blackness must be considered in the
context]{.underline}¶ [of chattel slavery and the economy of enjoyment
founded thereupon]{.underline}]{.mark}. Antebellum ·¶ formations of
pleasure, even those of the North, need to be considered in relation to¶
the affective dimensions of chattel slavery since enjoyment is virtually
unimaginable¶ without recourse to the black body and the subjection of
the captive, the diversions¶ engendered by the dispossession of the
enslaved, or the fantasies launched by the¶ myriad uses of the black
body. For this reason the formal features of this economy of¶ pleasure
and the politics of enjoyment are considered in regard to the literal
and¶ figurative occupation and possession of the body. [This reading
attempts to elucidate]{.underline}¶ [the means by which [the wanton use
of and the violence directed toward the black]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶
[body come to be identified as its pleasure]{.underline}]{.mark} [and
dangers-that is, the expectations of]{.underline}¶ [slave property are
ontologized as the innate capacities and inner feelings of
the]{.underline}¶ [enslaved, and moreover, the ascription of excess and
enjoyment to the African]{.underline}¶ [effaces the violence perpetrated
against the enslaved.]{.underline} In light of these issues, the¶
schematic analysis of minstrelsy and melodrama that follows focuses on
the convergence¶ of violence and pleasure, which is identified as one of
the primary attributes of¶ this economy of enjoyment, rather than
providing a close reading of the texts of¶ minstrelsy and melodrama.
Scant attention is paid to the white spectator\'s identification¶ with
blackface characters. Instead, the major issue explored is the relation¶
between pleasure and violence-that is, the facility of blackness in the
other\'s self-fashioning¶ and the role of pleasure in securing the
mechanisms of racial subjection.¶ In other words, [[this economy of
enjoyment is interrogated through a consideration]{.underline}¶ [of the
dynamics of possession and close scrutiny of the object of property and
its]{.underline}¶ [uses.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### Turn -- Intersectionality

#### Afro-pessimism as a totalizing theory cedes potential for radical surrender to intersectionality which is key for black feminist praxis 

Nash 19, (Jennifer C. Nash, *Black Feminism Reimagined: After
Intersectionality*, 2019, Jennifer C. Nash is Associate Professor of
African American Studies and Gender and Sexuality Studies at
Northwestern University)GP

In this chapter[, [I imagine a black feminist theoretical and political
project that could surrender]{.underline}]{.mark} [its territorial hold
[to intersectionality]{.mark} and permit the analytic to move untethered
from the imagined specificity of black woman.]{.underline} My
understanding of surrender is indebted to Kevin Quashie's work on black
interiority, which complicates the prevailing notion that surrender is
"a passive term, the counterpart to being conquered, dominated, or
defeated."8 Instead, Quashie argues that surrender can be "expressive
and active," "a deliberate giving up to another, the simultaneous
practice of yielding and falling toward what is deeply and largely
unknowable."9 Drawing on Quashie[, I treat a [black feminist surrender
of intersectionality not as a form of "defeat" but as the beginning of
reimagining]{.mark} black feminist theoretical and political life, as a
deep act of generosity that unleashes connections between black feminism
and women of color feminism,]{.underline} enabling black feminism to
imagine itself otherwise. Indeed, this chapter endeavors to energize a
black feminist politics of surrender by asking what if we surrendered
the notion that black woman is intersectionality's key sign? What if we
insistently despecified intersectionality[? [What if we embraced a
vision of intersectionality]{.underline}]{.mark} [that was capacious
enough to center women of color]{.underline} generally and that insisted
on the intimacies between transnationalism and intersectionality in
terms of both their construction and use by women's studies and their
creative world-making possibilities? [What if [intersectionality could
be mobilized to theorize arrangements of power beyond US black woman,
and thus as a generative space of intimacy among women of
color]{.mark}?]{.underline} In other words, I treat a despecified
intersectionality, one that does not necessarily reference black woman,
as a critical response to how women's studies has imagined both
intersectionality and transnationalism, and as an opportunity for black
feminists to imagine a kind of intimacy with both transnationalism and
the broader category "women of color." This form of letting go,
effectively ceding a proprietary relationship with intersectionality,
allows for new forms of intimacy, allegiance, and alliance and promotes
a form of black feminist agency that is far from the defensive posture I
trace in the first half of the book.

### Perm

#### Perm 1 -- Do the aff and all non-mutually exclusive parts of the alternative

#### Perm 2 -- Do the aff and resist anti-blackness. We will win a link turn that the affirmative makes the material conditions of anti-blackness better. Endorse the aff and other practices that aim to chip away at the structure of anti-blackness

#### Double bind: either the alternative solves anti-blackness, and we will win perm 1 because the aff is consistent; or the alternative doesn't solve anti-blackness, and we will win perm #2 is a better way to tackle both aff and neg impacts

#### Prefer the perm: Systems of power are interlocking... and forcing competition between the aff and the alt links to white masculine rationality

**Collins, 1990**[.]{.underline} (Patricia Hill Collins, Associate
Professor of African American Studies, University of Cincinnati, Black
Feminist Thought: Knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of
empowerment, 1990, p. 225)

[[Additive models of oppression are]{.mark} firmly [rooted in the
either/or dichotomous thinking of Eurocentric, masculinist
thought]{.mark}.]{.underline} One must be either Black or white in such
thought systems -- persons of ambiguous racial and ethnic identity
constantly battle with questions such as "what are you, anyway?" [This
emphasis on quantification and categorization occurs in conjunction with
the belief that [either/or categories must be ranked. The search for
certainty of this sort requires that one side of a dichotomy be
privileged while its other is denigrated. Privilege becomes defined in
relation to its other.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Replacing additive models
of oppression with interlocking ones creates possibilities for new
paradigms.]{.mark} The significance of [seeing race, class, and gender
as interlocking systems of oppression]{.mark} is that such an approach
[fosters a paradigmatic shift of thinking inclusively about other
oppressions]{.mark}, such as age, sexual orientation, religion, and
ethnicity. Race, class and gender represent the three systems of
oppression that most heavily affect African-American women. But these
systems and the economic, political, and ideological conditions that
support them may not be the most fundamental oppressions, and they
certainly affect many more groups than Black women. Other people of
color, Jews, the poor, white women, and gays and lesbians have all had
similar ideological justifications offered for their subordination. [All
categories of humans labeled Others have been equated to one another, to
animals, and to nature]{.mark}]{.underline} (Halpin 1989). [Placing
African-American women and other excluded groups in the center of
analysis opens up possibilities [for a both/and conceptual
stance]{.mark}, one in which [all groups possess varying amounts of
penalty and privilege in one historically created
system]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this system, for example, white women
are penalized by their gender but privileged by their race. Depending
upon the context, an individual may be an oppressor, a member of an
oppressed group, or simultaneously oppressor and oppressed.

### Perm -- Intersectionality

#### Perm -- we must join struggles together against the patriarchy in an intersectional lens in order to advocate for women who are often excluded from feminist conversations

womanist, librarian, and civil rights activist. Black lesbian writer who
addressed injustices such as racism, sexism, classism and homophobia

[But our future survival is predicated upon our ability to relate within
equality. As women, [we must root out internalized patterns of
oppression within ourselves if we are to move beyond the most supercial
aspects of social change.]{.mark} Now we must recognize dierences among
women who are our equals, neither inferior nor superior, and devise ways
to use each others' dierence to enrich our visions and our joint
struggles.]{.underline}

[The [future of our earth may depend upon the ability of all women to
identify and develop new denitions of power]{.mark} and new patterns of
relating across dierence. The [old denitions have not served us,]{.mark}
nor the earth that supports us. The old patterns, no matter how cleverly
rearranged to imitate progress, still condemn us to cosmetically altered
repetitions of the same old exchanges, the same old guilt, hatred,
recrimination, lamentation, and suspicion.]{.underline}

### Feminism DA

#### Baudrillard destroys feminist projects

Cultural Theory, Feminist Critique, Marxist Theory and Globalization

Beyond the \"End of Ideology \" [In postmodern social
[theory]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially in the work of Ernesto Laclau
and Chantal Mouffe, [ideology is [seen as undergoing a
\"break]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} In their writings, Laclau and Mouffe,
through a heavy reliance on Lacan and Althusser, have erased the
materialist theory of ideology articulated in Marx and Engels\' The
German Ideology and more em- phatically reiterated in Marx\'s own
Capital In order [to dramatize the break, they have reduced the
classical Marxist [theory of ideology to a simple]{.mark} \"[false
consciousness]{.mark}\"]{.underline} and with great fanfare have
represented Althusserian and post-Althusserian views as groundbreaking
concep- tual feats. Ideology after this \"break\" has become a
generalized rep resentation from which no one can escape and in which
everyone is condemned to live their social being. One of the
consequences of this notion of ideology, of course, has been its erasure
of the rigid clarity of class antagonisms and any other binaries (such
as true/false, powerful/powerless, exploitative/emancipatory) . This
paradox - that in a world in which ideology is one of the fundamental
axes of identity and social processes, intellectuals have declared it
ended - is caused by the fact that the regime of social relations of
production, which the Marxist tradition has explained by the concept of
ideology, has not only not ended but instead has intensified its hold on
the subject. The most effective way to disentangle the contemporary
impasse on ideology is to re-understand the materialist theory of
ideology. Ideology has a very specific and materialist meaning in the
Marxist tradition, especially in Marx\'s Capital (in which, curiously,
it has be- come common to say that the notion of ideology was abandoned
by Marx). In various chapters of Capital (especially chapters 1, 6, 9,
10, 1 1 and 12), Marx explains the process by which the worker exchanges
his/her labor-power for wages. In chapter ten he explains the pre- cise
mechanism of the working day, during which the worker pro- duces the
equivalent of his wages and also surplus labor. In chapter six he
theorizes the difference between labor and labor-power and concludes
that labor-power is that particular \"commodity whose use- value possess
the peculiar property of being a source of value, whose actual
consumption is therefore itself an objectification of labor, hence a
creation of value\" (1977, 270). The exchange, he concludes, between the
capitalist and the worker is an exchange of labor-power for wages. This
exchange is represented in bourgeois theory as a free, unfettered and
equal exchange. In fact, at the end of chapter six, Marx makes a point
of dwelling on this \"free-trader vulgaris\" view of the exchange of
wages for labor-power; he concludes that it is anything but an equal
exchange - it leaves the worker, Marx notes, \"like some- one who has
brought his own hide to market and now has nothing else to expect but -
a tanning\" (1977, 280). The historical materialist concept of ideology
seeks to account for the representations of this exchange as an equal
and fair ex- change. This, I want to emphasize, is the [core of the
materialist theory of ideology: how the relation between wage-labor and
capital is rep- resented as free and equal when it is anything
but]{.underline} (it is \"a tanning\") . [[False]{.mark}
[consciousness]{.mark}]{.underline} (the bête noir of postmodern
theories of ideology) [[is a \"struggle concept\"]{.mark}]{.underline}
(to adopt Maria Mies\' term) by which a mate- rialist understanding
marks the consciousness that regards this ex- change to be an exchange
among equals and conducted in freedom. It is a false consciousness,
because it is seen as unfettered and un- coerced when, in fact, as Marx
himself argues, this exchange takes place under \"the silent compulsion
of economic relations\" - a com- pulsion that \"sets the seal on the
domination of the capitalist over the worker\" (Marx, 1977, 899). False
consciousness is the conscious- ness that misrecognizes the compulsion
of economic relations as free and therefore accepts the exchange of
wages for labor-power as equal. Even a quick look at the
post-Althusserian theories of ideology will make clear that, far from
being groundbreaking theories, **[[the postmodern notion of ideology is
simply an erasure of the material- ist theory of ideology and a
marginalization of the role of labor]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [It ends up
essentially legitimizing the relation between wage-labor and
capital]{.underline}. T[o say, as postmodern theories of ideology say
over and over again, that there is no space outside ideology is to say
that it is impos- sible to mark any relation as a relation of
inequality]{.underline}. Because to say that the exchange of wages for
labor-power is unequal, according to postmodern theory, is to set up a
\"true\" {i.e., \"equal\") relation. This is \"wrong,\" according to
postmodern theory, because it establishes a binary in which a truthful
relation masters a false relation. But this is exactly what happens
under capitalism. The relation between wage- labor and capital is an
unequal relation, and to simply say that draw- ing attention to its
inequality is to fall into binaries is to substitute bourgeois
epistemology for social justice. [Ideology is not epistemol- ogy: to try
to make ideology part of epistemology and then decon- struct it through
a maneuver in which right and wrong, correct and incorrect, truthful and
untruthful are pitted against each other is to simply relegitimate
capitalist relations]{.underline}. [[The crisis we are witnessing now in
the theory of ideology is the crisis of this legitimization of an unjust
relation in the discourses of intellectuals who, in their formal
theories, declare themselves to be anti-capitalist and friends of the
people.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**[increased [income inequality]{.mark} has [led]{.mark} [the privileged

who interviewed white and black working-class men in New York in the
90s, found that **[[neoliberal economic realities]{.mark} and the
decline of traditional collective sources of solidarity had [rendered
white working-class men quite vulnerable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[One

Indeed, by the 90s in the US, **[the white imaginary offered two
predominant socially reviled subject positions to poor African
Americans]{.underline}**: the omnipotent male criminal, who terrorizes
vulnerable whites with his nefarious entrepreneurial skills, and his
split-off other side, the female welfare dependent, who, since Reagan,
has held all of the country's disavowed need and has been used as a
signifier of the failures of big government. As I shall argue, **[a
typical form of splitting endemic to [neoliberal]{.mark} practices and
[ideologie]{.mark}s [pits omnipotent narcissistic versions of autonomy
against degraded]{.mark} narcissistic versions of [dependence.]{.mark}
This instance of a racist white imaginary well exemplifies how a radical
split between autonomy and dependence can be projected seamlessly onto a
racialized and gendered divide.]{.underline}**

and other non-psychoanalytic thinkers focus on neoliberal subjective
practices that demand a shift from comfort with dependence to
repudiation of dependence. In a psychoanalytic frame, however, which
recognizes no possibility of overcoming dependence**[, t[he task is to
comprehend the]{.mark} psychic [effects of a]{.mark} cultural lack of
attunement to dependency needs and [a cultural encouragement to
split]{.mark} off and project [dependency needs and
vulnerabili]{.mark}ty]{.underline}**. Such
**[[effects]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as we have seen, **[[include]{.mark}
intense [shame]{.mark} about dependence]{.underline}** (see [Jimenez and
Walkerdine,

imagine ourselves self-sufficient and omnipotent, needing no one (the

### Alt Fails 

**Baudrillard's theory cannot distinguish between the productive
politics of the aff and the mass snooze of commodification---the
affirmative disproves the simulation thesis by producing content that
ruptures and interrupts the droning message of the war on terror.**

**Rojek 1993** (Chris, Senior Editor in Sociology at Routledge *Forget
Baudrillard?* P. 120

Yet **[to imply that poetry excludes politics is surely
eccentric]{.underline}** **[Observing and communicating cannot be
satisfactorily understood as unchanging constants. There is an
historical dimension to them]{.underline}**, as unchanging constants.
There is an historical dimension to them. **[[Baudrillard's sociology
is]{.mark} fatally immune to this because it is bluntly
[ahistorical]{.mark}. So [it ignores how observing and communicating
have changed and minimizes the stratified difference sbetween
communicators and observers]{.mark}. Baudrillard correctly stresses that
the distraction factories of the gflobal communications industry
confuyse our sense of change and our awareness of difference. But [the
minimalist picture of humans as 'monitroing screens']{.mark} or
'terminals in mass communication networks' which his sociloygy supplies
[is]{.mark} an [unsuitable]{.mark} answer to this confusion. [It does
not]{.mark} even [take seriously the circulation processes]{.mark} which
his work identifies. For [circulation involves not only repetition but
also reaction]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Benjamin's sociology allows for
reaction. His discussion of mass reproduction and the global circulation
of images, bodies and commodities **[[does not negate a political
response; on the contrary it demands one]{.mark}. The decline of aura,
the homogenization of culture and the manipulation of the masses are all
things which Benjamin opposes. There may be a note of melancholy in his
assessment of the prospects for successfully opposing these historical
tendencies but he does not waver in his commitment to struggle and
resistance. In contrast, [Bduarillard discusses mass reproduction ,
homogenization, and manipulation as immoveable facts of life]{.mark}.
One relates ot them through irony, play, seduyction and movement.
[Commitment in Baudrillard's]{.mark} aleatory, reversible
[universe]{.mark} is always a sign of stuborrness. It [closes down one's
range of response to the isness of hyperreality]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### Turn -- Overdeterminism

**There is no all-encompassing system of value that makes everything
people do the capitalisms---your impact claims are overdetermined and
vague---the affirmative's creation of new codes is an effective form of
politics.**

**MacCannell and MacCannell 1993** (Dean and Juliet, Sociology and
English professors respectively at UC-Irvine, *Forget Baudrillard?* p.
141-143)

We are suggesting that **[[Baudrillard took his analysis of the simula-
crum up to the site of the new forms of capitalist
exploitation]{.mark}]{.underline}** that have introjected class
structure into postmodernity. **[But he did not name the new sites of
exploitation or initiate critical examination of them. His failure in
this regard places his work at great risk]{.underline}**. Historically
it may contribute as much to the new forms of exploita- tion and their
cover-up as to their exposure and eventual overthrow. He cannot \'read\'
or \'see\' Mickey Mouse because Mickey stands in precisely the same
relation to code creation as Baudrillard\'s theory taken in its
entirety. Ultimately, both **[[Baudrillard]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
Mickey Mouse **[[insist]{.mark} [on]{.mark} a generalized sense of the
possible existence not of codes, which would be subversive, but of [The
Code, a single frame- work, already in existence, for
everything]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The Code, and correla- tively the
pretence of the absence of need for any new code, **[is [the only field
for the putative free play of simulacra]{.mark}, or the appearance of a
figure]{.underline}** of lack **[which can be universally
worshipped]{.underline}**. **[[If there were a code, it truly would
accommodate human life to the impos- sible, to death]{.mark}, to
ultimate pleasure, to the real. [I f there were a code it would be
equally and freely available to all human beings]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Group, class, status, category, would disappear or be rendered
insignificant**[. No wonder it is fervently desired by the prematurely
utopian adherents of every political position]{.underline}**. It would
be stable and open to all for all time until the radical end of time
that is supposed to be the Last Judgement.¶ Postmodernity affirms the
possibility of The Code in the form of¶ pure repetition, the simulacrum,
and the \'random cannibalization of styles of the past\', as Jameson put
it. But postmodern capitalism is also committed to apparent diversity of
consumer goods within the framework of a single Code, a commitment that
produces a certain tension if not a contradiction and dialectic.
Apparent diversity is achieved by the marketing of diverse codes the
source and origin of which are officially unrecognized and repressed.¶
We suggest that what is being exploited by postmodern capital- ism are
the codes of those in the starkest of human situations, who have
confronted \'the worst\' most radically in their \'lifestyles\' (=codes)
or modes of relating to death and fulfilment. **[What is most
successfully \'marketed\' today are simulacra of whole ways of existing,
adaptations of \'gang youth\', punks, \'primitive\' Brazilian
Indians]{.underline}** (At Play in the Fields of the Lord), homeless
people, bag ladies, hookers, war victims, AIDS sufferers (the list is
extended daily), their codes, the means they have worked out for dealing
with the worst. We further suggest that Lacan was correct in his
assertion that the \'panic\' of the drive has displaced the Symbolic of¶
desire for the contemporary or postmodern subject. There is no more
\'needs fulfilment\' in postmodernity. Capitalism, driven beyond its
capacity to provide, has seen to that. **[[All that it can promise us
now is an endless series of futile attempts to accommo- date that which
carmot be accommodated]{.mark}: the satisfied need, ultimate jouissance,
death]{.underline}**. Its radical failure of symbolization leaves its
believers \'eyeball to eyeball\' with The Real. Postmodern capitalism is
the realm of \'enjoyment\', where the human subject is commanded \'to
enjoy\' but carmot, where pleasure that cannot be experienced spills
over into The Thing, where our \'things\' obscenely and menacingly enjoy
themselves at our expense.¶ But there are those among us who deal
directly with the absolute- ness of loss, those who know there is no
substitutability, no itera- bility, no supplement. They have carved out
an existence on the empty gound between the possibility of the
symbolization of desire and the dream of a single Symbolic-Paternal
Order. They are the only possible source of a critical viewpoint on
postmodern capital- ism and of the creative energy needed to move it.
**[[We are disappointed with Baudrillard for not having found the site
of post- modern exploitation, for giving us instead nostalgia]{.mark}
for the medieval Church in the form of the now commonplace postmodern
assertion of its absence]{.underline}**. But if
**[[Baudrillard]{.underline}]{.mark}** spends all his time with¶
commodities-as-simulacra, with God as simulacrum, with things that can
have no relation to need, there must be a reason for it. He **[[is
avoiding the ground that has been departed by the cause of desire, the
ground where new codes are created as a matter of
necessity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is the reason he did not find
Mickey Mouse. Mickey is there on the ground of departed desire as a
defender of its borders, to block those who have not entered and to
cover up the creative adaptations of those who have. Mickey permits us
to imagine that there is a universal code of which he is the emanation
and emissary, while his owners, if not his animators, know there are as
many codes - ripe for the plucking - as there are human groupings. What
Mickey does not permit us to imagine is his code: that his head, with
the two ears that never change their location or position, that his head
is not only the maternal breast and the castrated balls, but a motion
picture projector. What this Mickey- projector reproduces is not a
universal code for iteration as has been claimed. It is rather a
faithful reproduction of the absolute loss human life is based upon; of
the theft of its creativity, its reduction, and abject resignation in
the face of The Real.

### AT: Grace

#### Victoria Grace is transphobic---their link/answer is just another reason to vote for us.  

**Guignion 21** (David, University of Western Ontario, The Journal of
Media Art Study and Theory Volume 2, Issue 1, 2021) 

[Grace combines her criticism of these two approaches to question if
trans identities are "a transgressive force that destabilizes and
challenges the gender binary"]{.underline} (117). Drawing upon the
influential work of Sandy Stone, Susan Stryker, and Judith Halberstam
(to name just a few), who have made significant contributions to the
trans theory, each contributing specifically to the way that trans
people are (pre)figured within the dominant matrix of cisgender and
hetero-normative social relations that permeate today, [Grace employs
Baudrillard's work to downplay these "transgenderist" beliefs that
"reflect uncritically precisely what is happening with the simulation of
gender, and accord almost perfectly with the contemporary hegemonic
structuration"]{.underline} (121). [The violence of Grace's suggestion
is striking for three primary reasons. Firstly, it positions trans
identities as simply a means to transgress power relations when, for
many---if not all---trans people, their identity as trans portends any
political affiliation. Trans people are not trans people to make a
political statement. Secondly, the disavowal of trans people's
identities as only participating in the hegemonic configuration of
gender (as either anatomy as destiny or performative as destiny) ignores
the fact that for many trans people their identities are a way by which
they may continue to survive in the world. In other words, by framing
their existence as a 'failure' to ostensibly challenge hyperreality, it
extends the familiar oppressive discourses that shroud their daily
lives. And thirdly, it is incredibly ironic for her to employ
Baudrillard, a cis-gender man, as the authority on what constitutes
appropriate, or properly political, identities.]{.underline} 

# AT: Framework

### AT: TVA - Trade off DA

#### Centering debates on specific operational aspects of military policy [trades off with]{.underline} analyses of cultural constructs that justify the use of force -- their model of debate doesn't challenge militarism

**Levy 15** Levy, Yagil. Prof. Yagil Levy. Department of Sociology,
Political Science and Communication at Open University of Israel \"What
is Controlled by Civilian Control of the Military? Control of the
Military vs. Control of Militarization.\" Armed Forces & Society (2015):

[What is controlled by civilian control of the military? One might think
that effective civilian control restrains the use of force.]{.underline}
However, **[that is not always the case]{.underline}**. On the contrary,
a glance at developments in civil--military relations during the post--
Cold War period shows that **[while civilian control has been tightened
in many democracies, militarization also increased.]{.underline}**
[Militarism is defined as an approach that regards war and the
preparation for war as a normal and desirable social
activity]{.underline}.1 [[Militarization]{.mark} [is]{.mark} therefore
[a process through which militarism increases]{.mark} while
demilitarization signifies a decline in this propensity]{.underline}. As
an illustration, [in the United States]{.underline}, as the campaigns in
Iraq and Afghanistan indicate, [militarization with an increased
propensity to use force2 thrived in an era of increased political
scrutiny of the military]{.underline}.3 In Israel, civilian control has
been enhanced since the 1970s, leading to an overly subordinate military
whose professional autonomy has been impaired,4 while the government has
enjoyed more legitimacy to launch offensive campaigns in Lebanon and the
Gaza Strip.5 In Russia, during Putin's rule, the military's subversive
behavior toward elected politicians has been moderated and its freedom
of action restricted,6 however, militarization in terms of patriotic
education,7 and the inflation of external threats8 has flourished. Thus,
[[increased civilian control of the military may be coupled with
militarization]{.mark}, although not necessarily]{.underline}. This case
raises the need for two scholarly investigations. The first, which I
will leave unexplored, is the extent to which there is a causal link
between civilian control and militarization. The second, and the focus
of this article, is the extent to which control of the military should
be distinguished from the mechanisms controlling the use of force, an
underdeveloped aspect in the study of civil--military relations, as I
explain in greater detail subsequently. I argue that **[a distinction
should be made between two modes of civilian control over military
affairs: control of the military and control of
militarization.]{.underline}** [Control of the military,]{.underline}
the main focus of students of civilian control, **[concerns itself
primarily with the military organization, particularly the operational
aspects of the military's performance (doctrine, deployment, resources,
etc.) and their expected political implications]{.underline}**. In
contrast, [the control of militarization deals with controlling the
mechanisms that legitimize the use of force, first and foremost military
force. It draws on political discourse, seeking to guarantee that the
use of force follows a thorough,]{.underline} **[open, and deliberative
process of decision making in which the citizenry plays an active and
autonomous role in addressing the legitimacy to use]{.underline}**. The
encounter between the modes of control yields several possible results.
It follows that this article is an analytically motivated study rather
an empirically motivated one. My aim is to develop a theory that
distinguishes between the control of the military and the control of
militarization and propositions regarding the encounter between the two
modes of control. These propositions can be viewed as hypotheses that
set the stage for future empirical inquiry.9 The first section presents
the gap in the literature, leading, in the second section, to a revised
conceptualization of civilian control. In the third section, I analyze
the relationship between the modes of control. The Theoretical Gap
Scholars disagree whether civilian control of the armed forces is
positively correlated with the reduction in the use of force. Lasswell
argued for such a positive correlation. In his classic ''garrison
state'' theme, he expressed concern that the empowerment of the military
establishment in reaction to an external threat would undermine
civil--military relations by letting the officers, as ''specialists in
violence,'' run the state and impose their warlike inclinations on
politics.10 Choi and James validated this concern statistically by
concluding that as the influence of the military increases, the
likelihood that the state will be involved in a military dispute becomes
greater.11 Similarly, Snyder echoed the Lasswellian view by claiming
that the offensive bias is exacerbated when civilian control is weak,
and this bias grows more extreme when the military leverages the
operational doctrine to improve its position in civil--military
disputes.12 Sechser linked civilian control with the use of force by
suggesting that the cautious nature of military officers may be a
consequence of strong civilian control.13 Officers are concerned that a
strong civilian leadership will punish them for botched military
adventures. Mills went even further by arguing that there is no prospect
for peace without a monopolistic control of violence, an approach that
strongly links control with the restraint of force.14 In a different
manner, students of militarism such as Bacevich,15 Mann,16 and Shaw17
implicitly recognized that [the restraint of the military may take place
within a militaristic mind-set]{.underline}. At the extreme, as Mann
asserted with regard to the post-- Cold War expansionist trends of the
United States, **[''the notion of [civilian control]{.mark} of the
military [became meaningless, since civilians were the leading
militarists'']{.mark}.]{.underline}**18 It follows that **[civilian
control may not reduce the proclivity to use force]{.underline}**.
Recognizing that [militaristic pressures can come from civilian
origins]{.underline}, other scholars even assume that officers may be
less war-prone than politicians. Huntington famously contended that the
military is more conservative than civilians regarding the propensity to
use force, largely due to organizational cautiousness.19 Similarly,
Betts concluded that military leaders rarely recommend the use of force,
and their advice is more influential when counseling against military
intervention.20 Along these lines, Feaver and Gelpi showed that
militarily inexperienced leaders in the United States, more than
militarily experienced ones, extended the use of force to deal with
interstate conflicts that did not present a substantial threat to
national security. 21 Desch acknowledged that, ''the most prevalent
civil-military relations problem of the post-Vietnam era has not been
keeping the dogs of war on the leash, but rather getting them off of
it''.22 In other words, civilians may be more warprone than the
military.23 It follows that [civilian control may even promote the use
of force when war-prone civilians successfully mobilize the society for
war and even push the reluctant military to battle]{.underline}.24
Therefore, **[effective [civilian control]{.mark} can rein in the
military but not the use of force]{.underline}**. Here, therefore, is
the gap in the literature. Students of militarism do not link the
propensity to use force to the broader issue of what type of civilian
control may restrain the use of force, aside from the cultural process
of demilitarization. Furthermore, students of militarism have not
extended the theme of civilian control from controlling the military to
controlling the civilian institutions that legitimize the use of force.
Similarly, even students of civilian control who acknowledge that
civilian control and military restraint do not necessarily go hand in
hand have not questioned the extent to which we should decouple the two
different processes as different modes of control rather than different
effects of control. In other words, they have not scrutinized the
mechanisms legitimizing the use of force decoupled from the mechanisms
monitoring the armed forces. Given this gap in the literature, in the
following section I present a revised conceptualization of civilian
control by introducing the distinction between control of the military
and control of militarization. Two Modes of Control Control of the
Military A distinction should be made between control of the military
and control of militarization. **[Control [of the military]{.mark}
refers to the extent to which the citizenry[,]{.mark} through civilian
state institutions[, set]{.mark}s [limits]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the
freedom of [action of the military]{.mark} in the areas of activity that
have political implications, [such as]{.mark} military doctrine and
[policies, operational]{.mark} [plans]{.mark}, [weapons systems,]{.mark}
organization, recruitment, [and]{.mark} promotion of officers. Such
limits correspond with political objectives and the resources required
to attain those goals that civilians (in a democracy, popularly elected
civilians) shape autonomously. These goals are regarded as expressing
the will of society as a whole. The military, in turn, abides by these
civilian directives]{.underline}**.25 To a large extent, relations of
exchange are formed, in which the military subordinates itself to
civilian rulers in exchange for the resources (material and symbolic)
that the state possesses and provides to the military.26 It follows that
control of the military should be broadly conceptualized and should not
be limited to the relations between elected civilians and generals.
Viewed in this vein, although authoritarian regimes effectively control
their militaries (Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy are good examples),
control of the military is deficient without the engagement of the
citizenry. **[Control over the military [operates]{.mark} mainly
[through]{.mark} [institutional mechanisms that]{.mark} have an [effect
on the manner in which policy makers activate the
milita]{.mark}ry]{.underline}**. In addition to the monitoring of the
military by elected civilians, collective actors working outside the
formal institutions, mainly social movements and interest groups, often
affect institutional policy making through lobbying, protests, court
appeals, and the media. Ultimately, [what is important is not whether
the troops are deployed to fight or remain in their barracks but the
political process that leads to the decision about the deployment,
pertaining to the broader political implication of military activity as
presented earlier]{.underline}. As a highly developed theme, control of
the military is not the focus of this article but control of
militarization and its relationship with the control of the military is.
Control of Militarization While the control of the military is aimed at
controlling the organization and its supervisors, **[[the control of
militarization is]{.mark} concerned with [controlling the mechanisms for
legitimizing the use of force.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Drawing on Burk's
''way of war,''27 Johnston's ''strategic culture,''28 Mann's
''militarism,''29 and Beetham's ''political legitimacy,''30 **[[the
legitimacy to use force relates to the extent to which]{.mark} the
state's legal mode of [using armed force against an]{.mark} external
[adversary is socially accepted as a normal,]{.mark} pervasive, and
enduring strategic [preference]{.mark}. Such [legitimacy encompasses
social beliefs about the role of war in human affairs, the nature of the
adversary and the threat it poses]{.mark}, and the efficacy of the use
of force]{.underline}**. Legitimacy can be evaluated along a spectrum
whose most extreme pole at one end is pacifism. Pacifism opposes the use
of force to resolve international disputes. In the middle of the
spectrum, the use of force is legitimized when it is instrumental in
defending what is perceived as the nation's security. The other extreme
pole is militarism, meaning that the legitimacy for using force is
unquestionable or barely questionable. Militarism ranges from regarding
the use of force and the preparation for war as a normal and desirable
social activity,31 an approach that typifies many industrialized
democracies (and therefore is the definition used in this article), to
an irrational value system that espouses war as a goal in itself.32 The
degree of this legitimacy can be determined by monitoring public opinion
and political debates. However[, **public and elite opinion and
[rhetoric]{.mark} can be more deeply analyzed as a multilayered
structure, which [reflects deeper cultural constructs]{.mark} that are
less easily detectable[. Focusing on]{.mark} the level of
[legitimacy]{.mark} for using force [moves beyond the narrow focus on
the military's institutions]{.mark}, influence, and resources, and the
attitude toward the use of force [to address militarized political
cultures that are often generated outside of the military.]{.mark}
Assuming that militarism is a socially and politically driven
phenomenon, the military is not necessarily the most salient part of the
political culture nurturing militarism**.]{.underline} When it is more
restrained than warmongering politicians, the influence of the military
does not result in militarization. Hence, **[[an exclusive focus on the
military may be misleading]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The control of
militarization involves the political discourse in which the citizenry
plays an active and autonomous role. [This discourse aimed at subjecting
the elected civilians' use of force to a deliberative process that takes
place within the public and political arenas and addresses the
legitimacy to use force. Several conditions promote this deliberative
process]{.underline}: 1. Relative slowness in decision making to
guarantee that decisions are made through argumentation in which
everyone's opinion is in principle equally valuable and equally
fallible. As Huysmans held, such deliberation takes time and can always
be questioned again. Thus, speedy decision making in response to a
perceived threat thwarts this principle, strengthens the executive
branch of government, and suppresses dissent.33 2**[[. Debates should
not be confined to the operational aspects of military policies but
should extend to the broader logic behind]{.mark} and rightness of such
[policies]{.mark}. In other words, [the debates should focus on the very
legitimacy for using force and its utility in promoting the public
good]{.mark}]{.underline}**.34 Thus, **[[the focus is on affecting the
political cultures legitimizing the use of force, rather than taking
this legitimacy for granted]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Therefore, during
the debates there should be a thorough consideration of nonlethal or
less belligerent policy alternatives. 3. **[Access to information is not
obstructed by manipulation, such as threat inflation]{.underline}**.35
4. Relatedly, [debates should be conducted through an open discourse in
which the dominant discourse does not hinder the political opposition
from challenging decision makers]{.underline}.36 Such a dominant
discourse often takes the form of asserting the need for unity in times
of crisis, thereby muting dissenting voices.37 By extension,
**[challenging the decision makers should also challenge the power
relations in society that affect the legitimacy of using force and may
create barriers to deliberation.]{.underline}** In general, deliberation
alone does not necessarily ensure a more democratic outcome unless
actors have other power resources as well, such as the ability to
mobilize to overcome entrenched interests.38 This is why free and fair
elections, along with constitutional mechanisms such as checks on the
power of each branch of government, equality under the law and impartial
courts, are preconditions for the deliberative process.39

### Metaphorical Analysis Key

#### Political deliberation is based more on how metaphors animate policy than rational choices

**Heidt 13** Heidt, Stephen J. Department of Communication, Georgia
State University. \"Presidential Rhetoric, Metaphor, and the Emergence
of the Democracy Promotion Industry.\" Southern Communication
Journal 78.3 (2013): 233-255. rishi

[Presidential rhetoric always ignores policy details partially because
presidents don't like to speak in specifics, but also partially
**because metaphoric appeals are easier to extend.** Presidents turn to
metaphor because they recognize the power of [metaphor]{.mark}, the
ability of metaphor to [connect]{.mark} complicated public [policy
proposals to broader]{.mark} themes and
[representations]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of America]{.underline},]{.mark}
**[[and the difficulty]{.mark} opponents have [in countering
metaphorical depictions]{.mark} of public policy]{.underline}**. In this
way**[, [public decision making is]{.mark} premised [not]{.mark} on the
[evaluation of specific policies but]{.mark} instead on the [assessment
of]{.mark} the archetypal metaphors utilized by advocates and [the
ability of]{.mark} those [metaphors to animate]{.mark} empty,
incomplete, or [poorly defined policy agendas.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
The danger reflected by this analysis is [that the use of metaphor to
extend public policy pushes an ultimately uncritical perspective, one
that asks audiences to accept the policy not on its merits but on its
relationship to generalized conceptions of the human
experienc]{.underline}e. **[[The danger of uncritical acceptance
is]{.mark} such [that]{.mark}, over time[, advocates]{.mark} and publics
[come to believe their characterizations of international
situations,]{.mark} the necessity and inevitability of democracy, and
the U.S. role as benevolent assistant]{.underline}**. **[[These
rhetorical processes]{.mark} [allow for]{.mark} the
[appropriation]{.mark} and use [of]{.mark} [policy]{.mark} by those less
interested in the ideals that serve as the genesis for the policy and
instead desire [to redirect]{.mark} the [policy]{.mark} toward their own
ends[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[This is]{.mark} precisely
[what]{.mark} [occurred]{.mark} [during]{.mark} the George W. Bush
administration, leading one expert to fear that ''the close association
of democracy promotion both with the war in [Iraq]{.mark} . . . and with
the War on Terrorism . . . has badly hurt the legitimacy of democracy
promotion.''105]{.underline}** [[Critical inquiry into]{.mark} the
rhetorical forms like [metaphor that authorize]{.mark}, extend, or
reassert public [policy can]{.mark} usefully [expos]{.mark}e
[]{.mark}those forms as [antidemocratic tools that sanitize public
conceptions and convert]{.mark} well-intentioned public [policy]{.mark}
into something else entirely.]{.underline} These conclusions suggest
that more essays explaining metaphor's role in public policy would be
welcome.

### Subject Formation NB

#### Communication inside of this space is valuable because it disrupts colonial subject formation. The ways we think and talk about a subject influence and reflect the ways we act in relation to that subject.

just, and sustainable social order.]{.underline} Having recognized this,
progressive scholars and social reformers have begun articulating
alternative discourses of power, along with alternative models of social
practice. [Together, these efforts can be interpreted as a project of
**discourse intervention -- an effort to change our social reality by
altering the discourses that help constitute it**.]{.underline} In order
to advance this project, this paper deconstructs the dominant
Western-liberal discourse of power, clarifies elements of an alternative
discourse of power, and presents a case study of an alternative
discourse community and the alternative models of social practice that
it is constructing. **[The ways we think and talk about a subject
influence and reflect the ways we act in relation to that
subject]{.underline}**. This is the basic premise of discourse theory
(refer, for example, to Foucault, 1972, 1980; Hall, 1997; Phillips &
Hardy, 2002). This paper is about the ways we tend to think and talk
about power. In Western-liberal societies, our discourses of power are
almost exclusively conflictual or adversarial. Power tends to be
associated with competition at best, coercion or domination at worst.
[Given that the ways we think and talk about a subject influence the
ways we act in relation to that subject, these adversarial discourses of
power can be problematic because they obscure the mutualistic dimensions
of power that have played a significant role in human history and that
will need to play an even more significant role if we are to learn how
to live together peacefully in an increasingly interdependent
world.]{.underline} Peace researchers such as Kenneth Boulding (1990),
along with feminist writers and theorists such as Hartsock (1974) and
Miller (1982), have articulated alternative ways of thinking and talking
about power for precisely this reason. [These efforts can be understood
as a project of discourse intervention -- an effort to change our social
reality by altering the discourses that help constitute that
reality.]{.underline} To date, this project is still in a nascent stage
and thus remains an important yet incomplete intervention in the
Westernliberal culture of conflict. To further advance this project, an
alternative discourse of power needs to be more clearly articulated. It
also needs to be more fully reconciled with the conflictual models of
power that are necessary for critical social analysis but insufficient
as a normative framework for social practice[. Toward this end, this
paper briefly traces the contours of prevailing discourses of power by
examining them in their most explicitly articulated form: academic
discourses of power.]{.underline} After identifying the limitations of
these existing discourses, the paper outlines an alternative vocabulary,
along with a simple analytical schema, for thinking and talking about
power in both its mutualistic and adversarial expressions. The paper
concludes with an examination of how one alternative discourse community
-- the international Bahá\'í community -- is already constructing
alternative models of social practice. Power as dominationAs a central
concept within Western social theory, the academic study of power has
been approached in many ways, yielding diverse and valuable insights.
[For example, some theorists have focused on the different forms that
power takes, as well as the bases or resources that permit the exercise
of power (Wartenberg, 1990; Wrong, 1997); some have explored the complex
relationship between the quantitative distribution of power and the
processes of social consent that legitimate various expressions of power
(Hindess, 1996); some have examined the changing ways that power
circulates throughout societies, constructing social institutions as
well as individual subjectivities, as it imposes order and discipline in
historically specific ways (Foucault, 1980); and others have approached
the subject of power from other theoretical perspectives]{.underline}. A
review of such a rich and complex body of literature is, of course,
beyond the scope of this article. What this article will focus on is a
dominant current of thought within late-twentieth-century scholarship
that reflects popular Western-liberal discourses and assumptions
regarding power. In the latter half of the twentieth century, theorists
of power began to invoke what has become a widely-used distinction
between two broad ways of thinking and talking about power. This
distinction is made by contrasting the expression "power to" with the
expression "power over" (e.g., Connolly, 1974; Coser, 1976; Dowding,
1996; Hartsock, 1974, 1983; Lukes, 1986; Macpherson, 1973; Pitkin,
1972). As Wartenberg (1990, p.27) explains, the expressions power-to and
power-over are a shorthand way of making a distinction between two
fundamentally different ordinary-language locutions within which the
term "power" occurs. Depending upon which locution one takes as the
basis of one's theory of power, one will arrive at a very different
model of the role of power in the social world. [The predominant model
of power in Western social theory -- what I call the power as domination
model -- derives from the latter of these expressions. Although "power
to" is the basis of models in the physical and natural sciences, "power
over" highlights issues of social conflict, control, and coercion, which
have been the primary focus of Western social and political
scientists.]{.underline} This power as domination paradigm traces back,
either implicitly or explicitly, through the writings of diverse social
and political theorists, from Machiavelli (1961) to Weber (1986) to
Bourdieu (1994). It informed Hobbes' (1968) notion of a "war of all
against all" as well as Marx and Engels' (1967) theory of historical
materialism. Indeed, as Giddens (1984, pp. 256-7) points out, this
conflictual model of power underlies virtually all major traditions of
Western social and political theory, from the left and the right. [The
extent to which Western social and political theory has developed within
the boundaries of this paradigm can best be seen in the American
"community power debates" of the mid-twentieth century. Within these
debates, prominent power theorists from various sides of the political
spectrum, including Dahl, Bachrach and Baratz, and Lukes, all proposed
different operational definitions of the term power. Yet all of these
definitions fell squarely within the boundaries of the power as
domination paradigm]{.underline}. In brief, Dahl (1969, p. 80)
conceptualized power in simple behavioral terms, explaining that "A has
power over B to the extent that he can get B to do something that B
would not otherwise do". [In response to this simple behavioral
definition, Bachrach and Baratz (1970) argued that power over others can
also be exercised in more subtle ways that involve "the mobilization of
bias" within a social or political system in a manner that prevents some
people or groups from advancing their own self-identified
interests.]{.underline} As they (Bachrach and Baratz, 1970, p. 7)
explain: Power is also exercised when [A devotes his energies to
creating or reinforcing social and political values and institutional
practices that limit the scope of the political process to public
consideration of only those issues which are comparatively innocuous to
A. To the extent that A succeeds in doing this, **B is prevented, for
all practical purposes, from bringing to the fore any issues that in
their resolution might be seriously detrimental to A's set of
preferences**]{.underline}. Lukes (1974), in turn, insists that both of
these conceptualizations are too simplistic. According to Lukes, power
over others can also be exercised by preventing them from identifying or
recognizing their own interests. In other words, power can be exercised
over others by cultivating what Marx and Engels (1967) referred to as
false consciousness, or by exercising what Gramsci (1971) referred to as
cultural hegemony. As Lukes (1974, p. 23) explains[: A may exercise
power over B by getting him to do what he does not want to do, but he
also exercises power over him by influencing, shaping or determining his
very wants. Indeed, is it not the supreme exercise of power to get
another or others to have the desires you want them to have -- that is,
secure their compliance by **controlling their thoughts and
desires**?]{.underline} Though Dahl, Bachrach and Baratz, and Lukes each
advanced different operational definitions of the term power, all of
these definitions were contained within the boundaries of the power as
domination paradigm. To his credit, Lukes, along with a number of other
power as domination theorists since him, have acknowledged the
possibility that "power to" could serve as the basis for an alternative
model of social power. However, this acknowledgment has typically been
made in order to dismiss "power to" models as largely irrelevant to
social and political theory. As Lukes (1974, p. 30) originally
contended, "power to" models have less conceptual value than "power
over" models for two reasons. First, he asserted that these "revisionary
persuasive redefinitions \[i.e., "power to" definitions\]\... are out of
line with the central meanings of "power" as traditionally understood
and with the concerns that have always centrally preoccupied students of
power" (Lukes, 1974, pp. 30-31). Second, Lukes (1974, p. 31) asserted
that when one focuses on "power to" concepts "the conflictual aspect of
power -- the fact that it is exercised over people -- disappears
altogether from view, and along with it there disappears the central
interest of studying power relations in the first place". In this vein,
Lukes (1974, p. 31) argues that "power to" theories end up "concealing
from view the central aspects of power which they define out of
existence". Ironically, by dismissing "power to" theories, Lukes did the
same thing in reverse. Similar tendencies characterize the work of many
other power theorists. For instance, Wartenberg (1990, p. 5), after
drawing the distinction between "power to" and "power over" quoted at
the beginning of this paper, goes on to argue that a theory of power
has, as a first priority, the articulation of the meaning of the concept
of power-over because social theory employs this concept as a primary
means of conceptualizing the nature of the fundamental inequalities in
society. "Power over", he (Wartenberg, 1990, p. 5) thus asserts, is "the
primary meaning of 'power'". And, like Lukes, Wartenberg (1990, p. 5)
argues that a focus on "power to" relations merely "shifts the
theorist's gaze away from the set of phenomena that a theory of social
power must comprehend, namely the illegitimate inequalities that exist
in modern societies". Even Foucault, despite his radical re-thinking of
the nature and function of power, was unable to escape the gravitational
pull of the "power over" model in his own writing. [Foucault (1980)
understands power as a relational force that permeates the entire social
body, connecting all social groups in a web of mutual
influence]{.underline}. [As a relational force, power constructs social
organization and hierarchy by producing discourses and truths, by
imposing discipline and order, and by shaping human desires and
subjectivities]{.underline}. [In this context, Foucault sees power as
simultaneously productive and repressive: a social body cannot function
without it, despite its perennially oppressive
manifestations]{.underline}. By recognizing the productive function of
power, Foucault gives a nod to the "power to" theorists. However, in his
actual analyses, Foucault situates himself squarely within the
power-as-domination tradition, and his over-arching project is clearly
one of resistance to such expressions of power. Furthermore, he
explicitly calls for others to do the same: "We should direct our
researches on the nature of power", he (Foucault, 1980, p. 102) writes,
"towards domination and material operators of power", and we should
"base our analyses of power on the study of the techniques and tactics
of domination".

### FIAT Bad

#### Interpreting FIAT as simulation of USFG action destroys our agency in relating to the resolution -- turns deliberation and advocacy and reifies hegemonic ideologies

**Antonio 95** (Robert, July 1995, "Nietzsche's antisociology:
Subjectified Culture and the End of History", American Journal of
Sociology, Volume 101, No. 1)

[Treating words as mirrors of reality]{.underline} [provides a
comforting illusion of]{.underline} \"[certainty]{.underline}.\"
[This]{.underline} [tendency obscures the social bases of language,
reifies social conventions, and weakens capacities to imagine and create
alternative conditions]{.underline}. Linguistic \"abbreviations\" cement
obligatory social ties where \"mutual agreement\" about \"feelings\" is
absent and the tendency to \"let go\" must be stemmed. Nietzsche held
that language serves [social selection of the herd, keeping experiences,
desires, impulses, and actions of weak persons within boundaries,
inscribing strong individuals as collective enemies]{.underline}, and
redirecting ressentiment into regimentation. Accordingly, [cultural
rationalization makes this process of liquidating particularity more
effective and universal]{.underline} (Nietzsche 1966, pp. 100---102,
216---17; 19686, pp. 357-58, 380). Since Nietzsche was himself a master
writer, his polemics about words per se are hyperbolic.11 The real
target is Socratic culture\'s exceptionally abstract languages, rampant
conceptual reifications, and impoverished aesthetic sensibilities.
Nietzsche believed [that the obsession with rational representation
makes the body an inert target of disciplinary control]{.underline}.
Adoration of concepts, theory, and reason makes the abstract signifier
the ultimate object of knowledge. [Purely formal concepts are treated as
the \"highest,\" \"real,\" and \"true\" things, while sense experience
is relegated to the degraded status of \"appearance.\"]{.underline}
Platonic ideas, Chris- tian soul, Kantian things-in-themselves, and
Newtonian atoms and time are all foundational reifications that
\"dehistoricize\" the corporeal world and erect illusions of firm
\"grounds\" for those who cannot face life without God and tradition or
bear the weight of its connective choices and its \"great dice game\"
(Nietzsche 1974, pp. 287-90; 19686, p. 549; 19686, pp. 35-37).
[Destroying Socratic culture\'s \"objective\" foundations]{.underline}
(i.e., God and Truth), the latest phase of cultural rationalization
greatly amplifies feel- ings of uncertainty. [The consequent [desperate
searching and clinging produces frenetic reification; fanatical new
prejudices, religions, and politics appear alongside the most sterile
intellectual formalisms]{.mark}]{.underline}. Mass culture\'s hastily
formulated languages [blur all difference and ambiguity]{.underline}
(e.g., parties \"transform their principles into great at fresco
stupidities\"). The proliferation of abstract signifiers, arising from
diverse locations and detached from any sense of stable referents,
contribute to increasingly mechanical, diffuse, and mindless
regimentation. In this fashion, [Nietzsche severed the links that modern
theorists saw between rationalization and enhanced communication, social
integration, and legitimate authority]{.underline} (Nietzsche 1983, p.
215; 1986, pp. 161-62; 1966, pp. 216-17; 19686, pp. 357-58, 380-81).
[According to Nietzsche[, the \"subject\" is Socratic culture\'s]{.mark}
most central, durable foundation. This [prototypic expression of
ressentiment, master reification, and ultimate justification for]{.mark}
slave morality and [mass discipline]{.mark}]{.underline} \"separates
strength from expressions of strength, as if there were a neutral
substratum . . . free to express strength or not to do so. [But there is
no such substratum; [there is no \'being\' behind the doing, effecting,
becoming; \'the doer\' is merely a fiction added to the
deed]{.mark}]{.underline}\" (Nietzsche 1969b, pp. 45-46). [Leveling of
Socratic culture\'s \"objective\" foundations makes its \"subjective\"
features all the more important. For example, [the subject]{.mark} is a
central focus [of the new human sciences]{.mark}]{.underline}, appearing
prominently [[in its emphases on neutral standpoints, motives as causes,
and selves as entities, objects of inquiry, problems]{.mark}, and
targets of care]{.underline} (Nietzsche 1966, pp. 19-21; 1968a, pp.
47-54). [Arguing that subjectified culture weakens the
personality]{.underline}, [Nietzsche spoke of a \"remarkable antithesis
between an interior which fails to correspond to any exterior and an
exterior which fails to correspond to any
interior]{.underline}\" (Nietzsche 1983, pp. 78-79, 83). The \"problem
of the actor,\" Nietzsche said, \"troubled me for the longest
time.\"\'12 He [considered \"roles\" as \"external,\" \"surface,\" or
\"foreground\" phenomena and viewed close personal identification with
them as symptomatic of estrangement]{.underline}. While modern theorists
saw differentiated roles and professions as a matrix of autonomy and
reflexivity, Nietzsche held that [persons]{.underline} (especially male
professionals) [in specialized occupations over identify with their
positions and engage in gross fabrications to obtain
advancement]{.underline}. [They look hesitantly to the opinion of
others]{.underline}, [asking themselves, \"How ought I feel about
this?\" [They are so thoroughly absorbed in simulating effective role
players that they have trouble being anything but
actors]{.mark}]{.underline}-\"The role has actually become the
character.\" [[This highly subjectified social self or simulator suffers
devastating inauthenticity. The powerful authority given the social
greatly amplifies Socratic culture\'s already
self-indulgent]{.underline}
\"[inwardness]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" Integrity, decisiveness,
spontaneity, and [pleasure are undone by]{.underline} paralyzing over
[concern about possible causes, meanings, and consequences of acts and
unending internal dialogue about what others might think, expect, say,
or do]{.underline} (Nietzsche 1983, pp. 83-86; 1986, pp. 39-40; 1974,
pp. 302-4, 316-17). [[Nervous rotation of socially appropriate \"masks\"
reduces persons to hypostatized]{.underline}
\"[shadows]{.underline},\"]{.mark} \"abstracts,\" [[or
simulacra]{.underline}]{.mark}. One adopts \"many roles,\" playing them
\"badly and superficially\" in the fashion of a stiff \"puppet play.\"
Nietzsche asked, \"[Are you genuine? Or only an actor?  A representative
or that which is represented?]{.underline} . . . \[Or\] no more than an
imitation of an actor?\" [Simulation is so pervasive that it is hard to
tell the copy from the genuine article; [social
selves]{.mark}]{.underline} [\"[prefer the copies to the
originals]{.underline}]{.mark}\" (Nietzsche 1983, pp. 84-86; 1986, p.
136; 1974, pp. 232- 33, 259; 1969b, pp. 268, 300, 302; 1968a, pp.
26-27). [Their inwardness and aleatory scripts foreclose genuine
attachment to others]{.underline}. [This type of actor cannot plan for
the long term or participate in enduring networks of interdependence;
such a person is [neither willing nor able to be a \"stone\" in the
societal \"edifice]{.mark}\"]{.underline} (Nietzsche 1974, pp. 302-4;
1986a, pp. 93-94). Superficiality rules in the arid subjectivized
landscape. Nietzsche (1974, p. 259) stated, \"[One thinks with a watch
in one\'s hand, even as one eats one\'s midday meal while reading the
latest news of the stock market; one lives as if one always \'might miss
out on something. \'\'Rather do anything than nothing\': this principle,
too, is merely a string to throttle all culture]{.underline}. . . .
[Living in a constant chase after gain compels people to expend their
spirit to the point of exhaustion in continual pretense and overreaching
and anticipating others]{.underline}.\" Pervasive leveling, improvising,
and faking [foster an inflated sense of ability and an oblivious
attitude about the fortuitous circumstances that contribute to role
attainment]{.underline} (e.g., class or ethnicity). [The most mediocre
people believe they can fill any position, even cultural
leadership]{.underline}. Nietzsche respected the self-mastery of genuine
ascetic priests, like Socrates, and praised their ability to redirect
ressentiment creatively and to render the \"sick\" harmless. But he
deeply feared the new simulated versions. Lacking the \"born
physician\'s\" capacities, [these impostors amplify the worst
inclinations of the herd]{.underline}; [they are \"violent, envious,
exploitative, scheming, fawning, cringing, arrogant, all according to
circumstances]{.underline}. \" Social selves are [fodder for the \"great
man of the masses.\"]{.underline} Nietzsche held that \"[the less one
knows how to command, the more urgently one covets someone who commands,
who commands severely- a god, prince, class, physician, father
confessor, dogma, or party conscience.]{.underline} [[The deadly
combination of desperate conforming and overreaching and untrammeled
ressentiment paves the way for a]{.mark} new type of
[tyrant.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### AT: Deliberation

**Their model of deliberation relies on a hegemonically masculine model
of rationality and stasis point that attempts to push "unproductive"
knowledge to the private or domestic sphere --**

[[Tomlinson, 10]{.underline}]{.mark} (Barbara, "Feminism and Affect at
the scene of argument", Ch 1 -- transforming the terms of reading)

[[Contemporary]{.mark} U.S. [political and academic discourse abounds
with]{.mark} a [recurring]{.mark} set of formulaic [claims]{.mark} [that
feminist scholars]{.mark}]{.underline} (and feminists in general) [[are
angry]{.mark}, [unreasoning]{.mark}, shrill, humorless, ugly, man-
hating, perverse, and peculiar. [This "trope]{.mark} of the angry
feminist" [is]{.mark} designed to delegitimize feminist argument even
before the argument begins**, to undermine feminist
politics**]{.underline} by making its costs personal, and to foreclose
feminist futures by making feminism seem repulsive to young women. [[The
trope]{.mark}]{.underline} is a convention, a plot trick, a setup, a
narrative structure, a character type. 2 Its incessant repetition
[[constitutes part of a cultural training program that makes
antifeminism and misogyny a routine element in]{.underline}]{.mark}
everyday [speech and]{.underline} written
[[argument]{.mark}.]{.underline} Instigated by expressly po liti
calopposition to feminism, deploying affectively charged strategies that
float free of evidence, clichés like the angry feminist put animosity---
not argument--- at the center of politi cal discussions, interpellating
readers as always already antifeminist. [The [repetition and
circulation]{.mark} of such tropes [produces a]{.mark} cumulative
[overdetermined quality that makes them seem]{.mark} already [true
before]{.mark} the moment of [argument.]{.mark} One never encounters the
feminist's argument for the first time because it comes already
discredited]{.underline}. Because the trope of the angry feminist
encourages unacknowledged ways of interpreting feminist affect, its
inveterate irruption is consequential in journalism, entertainment, po
liti cal, and quasi- intellectual arenas, as I describe in this
introductory chapter. It is perhaps even more consequential in its
influence on academic discourses, the subject of the remainder of the
book: **[affect in [academic discourses on social justice is]{.mark}
often [policed through "ideologies of style" that purport to be neutral
but]{.mark} operate to [entrench current conditions of
power.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In this book I argue that **[we have
failed to theorize adequately the role of such pervasive affective and
ideologically encapsulated arguments in academic and political
discourses]{.underline}**. In consequence, we do not recognize that [our
[conventional]{.mark} reading [practices mislead us about ways to
comprehend]{.mark} and counter [them.]{.mark}]{.underline} I argue that
[[transforming the terms]{.mark} of reading [can reframe the problem,
and propose]{.mark} for that purpose [a]{.mark} critical
[toolkit]{.mark}]{.underline} that I call "feminist socioforensic
discursive analysis." My argument here constitutes a provocation to
transform the terms of reading, to reframe interpretation of affect in
both feminist and antifeminist writing. Th e [trope of the angry
feminist is a familiar conceit,]{.underline} like many similar phrases
**[deployed to delegitimize social criticism]{.underline}**, one that
draws on a deep well of related clichés, affective rhetorical
strategies, and familiar tropes. Th ese discursive moves circulate as
instantiations of power. Th e trope of the angry feminist presents
itself as fresh each time it is uttered, its repetitious banality framed
as mere reflection of the repetitious banality of the feminist's
argument. Th is leads to the absurd but po liti cally effi cacious
situation where readers are weary of arguments they have never heard.
These argumentative tactics often succeed in part because our normal
reading and writing practices lead us to object or counterargue in ways
that fail to come to grips with the specific nature of the rhetorical
situation that the tropes instantiate. **[Our [conventional]{.mark}
reading [practices reinscribe ways of thinking that seem "logical" or
"fair" because they are so familiar]{.mark}]{.underline}**; **[they lead
us to treat the tropes as surface features of discourse that serve to
"skew" debate from its direct and proper form. These conventional
practices, permeated by unacknowledged power relations, encourage us to
respond to the tropes "normatively," with reproaches about textual
etiquette, textual responsibility, or textual appropriateness, to
complain about inadequate evidence, to provide counterexamples, or to
condemn the person proffering the trope, as though its use violates an
agreement about the proper nature of civic discussion,]{.underline}**
and as if there is a mechanism of accountability. None of this is the
case. Responses that might chastise, correct, or even complain about the
trope of the angry feminist are inadequate in part because they rest,
ultimately, on an imaginary ideal: a discursive arena regulated by
impartial principles in which utterances are adjudicated by unbiased
observers. [[Framing political and]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[academic
discussion in this]{.mark} commonsense [way treats rhetoric as a neutral
technology to be deployed]{.mark} or evaluated [in isolation from its
conditions of production, the]{.mark} situations of [speakers,
or]{.mark} the general societal [power relations]{.mark} that give
utterances friendly to prevailing power relations an overdetermined
"reasonableness" while [**rendering most oppositional arguments
automatically suspect**. Our]{.mark}]{.underline} reading [[practices
already rest on uninterrogated and deeply gendered and racialized models
of]{.underline}]{.mark} textuality, [[argument]{.underline}]{.mark},
authorship, politeness, [and emotion]{.underline}. [Under such
conditions, affect is a potent tool of dominance,]{.underline} infusing
the reading situation to teach us what power is, who has it, how to get
it, how to be rewarded, and how to avoid the punishments power can
deliver. Louis Althusser (1971) argues that concrete individuals become
constituted as "subjects" through ideology, but the most powerful
ideological influences do not come to us in the form of ideological
pronouncements. Th at would make them visible, controversial, and
refutable. Instead, he argues, **[[the most powerful ideologies exist in
"apparatuses," in practices, and these practices are always
material.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Reading, writing, and [[argument are
social practices sedimented with ideologies of legitimacy, propriety and
fairness so]{.mark} powerful and [pervasive that we presuppose their
value rather than examining their effects.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**Pajnik, Mojca, 2006 (\"Feminist reflections on Habermas's
communicative action the need for an inclusive political theory.\"
European journal of social theory 9.3; p. 389-390)**

Although Habermas broke with the monologic tradition, a frequent
criticism among feminist authors is that his theory is too 'Kantian'.
According to this criticism, [[Habermas persisted in the conception of a
moral individual who is disembodied]{.mark} and self-centred -- [in
contrast to a relational and embodied]{.mark} female or male
[individual]{.mark}]{.underline}. Criticisms of the monologic stance of
communicative action are frequent, although a closer reading of
Habermas's theory shows that Habermas's individual is not tied to a
deeper inner contemplation. Habermas's individual is not liberated from
communication with others, but is realized through interaction with
others (Baynes, 1994: 319). Jane Braaten (1995) notes that
[[Habermas]{.mark}, with his theory of communicative action, [distances
himself]{.mark}, on the one hand, [from the Cartesian philosophy of the
subject, but]{.mark}, on the other, [reproduces it with the concept of
communicative rationality]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In explaining
communicative rationality, [Habermas becomes overly trapped in the
patriarchy of traditional epistemology,]{.mark} which tries to defend
the possibility of action in the period of the new historicism of late
modernity]{.underline}. Braaten tries to understand Habermas's theory
through the perspective of feminist reasoning and feminist epistemology,
on which she bases her alternative to communicative rationality. She
calls it communicative thinking, which is based on two principles: the
principle of solidarity and the principle of intersubjectivity. [As an
alternative to the technical image of rationality, grounded in Western,
Anglo-American theoretical traditions, according to which rational
action,]{.underline} to use Plato's terminology, [is reserved for the
'enlightened']{.underline}, Braaten advocates [a rational feminist
discourse which is based on the principle of solidarity and linked to
the issues of discrimination against women]{.underline}. By defending
different forms of rational action, she [attempts to transcend the
bounds of a technical explanation of the success and effectiveness of
action]{.underline}, which Habermas also problematized, particularly
with the critique of strategic, instrumental action (see Habermas,
\[1963\] 1972, 1968). The difference between communicative rationality
and communicative thinking is also explained by the author by drawing on
the principle of intersubjectivity: in [[Habermas's communicative
rationality]{.underline}]{.mark}, this [[is too narrowly tied to the
linguistic process of accepting and rejecting
arguments]{.underline}]{.mark}, [or]{.underline} [is]{.underline} at
least, as pointed out by Dallmayr (1984: 236), [not clearly
formulated]{.underline}. [Communicative thinking is a concept which
reflects the complexity of everyday life, and the multiple means of
action and which takes into account the diversity of contexts of
action.]{.underline} Braaten understands it as wider than communicative
rationality -- this she understands in a somewhat narrow sense as
(merely) spoken agreement, achieved by the domination of the superior
argument. [[Consensus, which in Habermas arises from a commonly defined
objectivity, assumes ideal, abstract]{.mark} individuals, while
communicative thinking considers life contexts and memories.
Communicative thinking includes 'imagination and
flexibility']{.underline} (Braaten, 1995: 156) [and relies on forms of
action which try to aerate the stability of social
structures]{.underline}. From the standpoint of the organization of
society, communicative thinking does not mean a rejection or abandonment
of communicative rationality, but rather an extension of rationality in
the direction of conceptualization, which Darij Zadnikar recognizes in
Habermas and calls 'a multi-dimensional ("soft") theory of rationality'
(Zadnikar, 1995: 9). Braaten, whose explanation of [communicative
thinking explicitly draws on a personal, even physical, feminist
perspective, identifies several meanings for this concept]{.underline}.
[Communicative thinking foremost means respecting differences in
everyday life with the inclusion of possibilities for the transformation
of conventional politics, with the aim of meeting specific needs, for
instance, those of women]{.underline}. [It advocates the rethinking of
the position of different groups of citizens to respect the
specificities of life contexts and opportunities]{.underline}. [By
providing an alternative to one-dimensionality and the systematic,
unified arrangement of structures, it stimulates the
multi-dimensionality of expression]{.underline} (Braaten, 1995: 156,
157). [Communicative thinking is a response to a technically defined
rationality which]{.underline}, in the view of some critics, [is still
present in Habermas's theory; it assumes the Kantian action of
autonomous, rational subjects: we can speak of the success of speech
acts, according to Habermas, when rational subjects act in order to
achieve a rational consensus]{.underline}. In this, [they are acting
according to communicative norms, the rules of universal pragmatics,
which assume a communicative competence for grammatical
expression]{.underline}. [[This rigidly defined communicative
rationality implies]{.underline}]{.mark}, as expressed in Benjamin
Barber's categories, [[too thin an understanding of communicative action
and in this framework communicative thinking as an alternative is of
interest]{.underline}.]{.mark}

### AT: SSD

#### Their conception of switch side normalizes opposition as a narrative of completeness that shuts out feminist considerations of IR

[Sjoberg and Chessman 2012]{.underline} (Laura Sjoberg, PhD in IR from
USC and Professor at UF, and Christian Chessman, JD UC Berk, \"The
Biopower of Occupation: Insights for 'Knowledge Exchange'in (Gender and)
IR," November 17, 2012
http://genderinglobalgovernancenet-work.net/events/critical-reflections-on-the-researcher-practitioner-relationship-2/attachment/sjoberg-and-chessman-biopower-of-occupation
(rishi)).

The second contribution we argue that "Occupy" as method could make to
feminist research is in understanding research more generally as being
stable in its liminality rather than anchored by a static certainty
about ontology, epistemology, method, or field politics. One way to
think about this might be thinking about IR as art, as Christine
Sylvester suggests: It takes an eye for sex and gender to see the art of
it all. Even then it is difficult. [[Surrounded by enchanted positivism,
which promises progress in knowledge --]{.mark} yes, this is the way! --
[only a long learning curve has brought us to the point of]{.mark}
X-raying and [carbon-dating the facts presented as timeless tendencies,
as 'objective' I]{.mark}]{.underline}[R]{.mark}. If we do not journey
along the learning curve[[**,** we end up trying to draw without
looking, observing, and reckoning with life]{.mark}.]{.underline}
(Sylvester 2002, 273) Sylvester is arguing that [[seeing the world in a
way that is linear, rational, and exclusively scientific neglects a
number of concerns which are normatively important to feminisms,]{.mark}
which find their substance in the political, the personal, and the
critical]{.underline}. At the [same time, anchoring research in
liminality contradicts the discipline's anchoring in a positivist social
science based on approximating certainty.]{.underline} As researchers,
[liminality-as-research-goal is another uninhabitable space in IR -- one
which might be physically inhabited as an embodied disruption of
positivist social science -- one which might be a space of otherness and
a space of protest all at once -- both providing new intellectual turf
for IR and disrupting its operationaliity.]{.underline} 29 Occupying
Research to Occupy (Feminist) IR We are interested in a number of ways
that both [research practice and the political landscape of the field
might change as a result of the introduction of the methodological
principles for performing research and navigating the field that we
glean from the ideas and practices of the 'Occupy'
movement.]{.underline} In our view, [one of the most useful questions
such an interpretation can ask is how the space of the need to 'do/think
things differently' becomes/became less inhabitable/uninhabitable space
in the discipline of IR/the practice of governance, and how to inhabit
that uninhabitable space, methodologically for IR theory and practically
for the world of governance?]{.underline} In the paper (ready for
posting soon), [we think of it [in terms of the "perfect
operationality]{.mark}" (in Baudrillard's terms) [of a simulacrum of
'what IR is']{.mark} (or, in your terms 'how to govern') where [the
system and its normalized 'opposition' form a tight narrative of
completeness that makes 'otherness' to it impossible]{.mark}. That
narrative completeness relies on bodies being where they are 'supposed'
to be (in Foucauldian terms about biopower being an enforcer of
sovereignty), and re-placement of bodies (occupation) interrupts the
narrative completeness of the imperium by demonstrating the
inhabitability of uninhabitable space.]{.underline}

# Case Neg vs. Fem IR Aff

### Poetry Bad

#### Poems lock the reader into ideology rather than allowing one to identify freely -- reifies the structures they critique - turns the case

**Altieri, '96** (Charles "Some Problems about Agency in the Theories of
Radical Poetics" Contemporary Literature, Vol. 37, No. 2 (Summer, 1996),
pp. 207-236)

All three cases offer important correctives to an academic culture that
has been obsessed with interpretation as the fundamental model of
readerly participation. But [even this struggle against the academy
requires some further considerations that]{.underline} I think [have not
been sufficiently taken up]{.underline} by the prevailing radical
theories. [Were we to grant that the fundamental problem of contemporary
Western culture was a blindness inflicted by the imposition of false
universals, [we]{.mark} would [still have to ask if it can suffice to
base our notion of what the text offers readers]{.mark}]{.underline} on
the project of resisting all hermeneutic idealization. For fact process
texts[, [do we not condemn them to those forces that shape them as such
subjects]{.mark}?]{.underline} [[We ignore the possibilities that the
text]{.mark} as structure, as willed object rather than as object of
free play, [can actually modify beliefs and provide alternative modes of
sensibility]{.mark}]{.underline}. So it seems that [if poetry is to
offer effective resistance to aspects of the dominant culture, [we will
have to grant it the power to construct hypothetical
countermodels]{.mark}]{.underline}, or, at the very least, to provide
modes of second-order reading by which an audience is invited to take
some distance from its own direct first-order habits. Poems must foster
readerly identities that simultaneously align imaginations with specific
processes confronting dominant ideological structures and reflect on
what is at stake in the choices made as one reads.

### Turn -- Academy

#### The AFF operates within the academy, destroying the emancipatory potential on two fronts: the authors of their lit are removed from the actual problems and information produced in the academy will only serve to hold up the structural issues they critique---anything else won't be published

**Lynch 1999** (Kathleen, University of Dublin, The Economic and Social
Review, Vol. 30, No. 1, January, 1999, pp. 41-69)

While several [feminist theorists]{.underline} have engaged with the
contradictions of their class position in relation to emancipatory
research, critical theorists often tend to [ignore the logic of the sets
of cultural relations within which academic knowledge is
produced.]{.underline} Critical theorists, no more than other
intellectuals "tend to leave out of play their own game and their own
stakes"\...Yet, "the production of representations of the social world,
which is a fundamental dimension of political struggles, is the virtual
monopoly of intellectuals\..." (Bourdieu, 1993, p. 37). [Even academics
who are themselves critical of the failure of critical theory to
problematise its own fundamental assumptions, do not address themselves
to the problem of the academically embedded context in which theory is
constructed]{.underline} (Sayer's, 1995 critique of critical theory is a
case in point). Academics create virtual realities, textual realities,
ethnographic and statistical realities. These overhang and frame the
lived existence of those who cannot name their own world; it is
frequently in the context of these detached and remoter realities that
public policy is often enacted. The frame becomes the picture in the
public eye. Yet theoretical knowledge has serious limitations imposed
upon it by the conditions of its own performance. The relations of
cultural production within which critical theory, feminist theory, and
egalitarian theory are produced are generally no different to those that
operate for the study of nuclear physics, corporate law or business and
finance. [Although some academics may view themselves as radical,
reforming, feminist or emancipatory, they occupy a particular location
within the class system]{.underline} (Bourdieu, 1993, pp. 36-48). [They
are part of the cultural elite of society. It is the designation of
cultural elitism which provides them with the structural conditions to
write; it gives them credibility over other voices and reinforces the
perception of superiority which maintains the salary differentials
between themselves and other workers. Being granted the freedom from
necessity to write and discuss is a privilege which academics
(]{.underline}be they liberal, radical or conservative) [in well-funded
universities are rarely asked to reflect upon, however.]{.underline}
[Yet, academics are also subordinate to powerful corporate interest
groups in the business and industrial sector. In a sense, therefore,
they occupy a contradictory class location]{.underline} (Davies, 1995),
being at once an elite in the cultural sphere and relatively subordinate
in the industrial or financial sphere. Thus, while the concept of the
"free-floating, disinterested intellectual" may be part of the ideology
of academia it is not grounded in any sociological reality; even radical
intellectuals are culturally, and relatively financially, privileged.
Operating within a contradictory state, of being personally radical and
publicly privileged, makes it difficult for many politically left-wing
academics to be progressive in cultural or university politics. It is
much simpler to be progressive in general politics that do not touch the
core values of one's own work. Bourdieu (1993, p. 45) suggests that
there is no easy resolution to this dilemma for radical intellectuals.
He proposes a radical, ongoing reflexivity wherein one prepares "the
conditions for a critical knowledge of the limits of knowledge which is
the precondition for true knowledge" as the principal protection
available. In this way, researchers know where they themselves stand in
the classification system. Even if academics do engage in ongoing
reflexivity, this does not alter the structural conditions under which
they work. [The dilemma posed by unequal power between researcher and
research subject is not readily resolved, even when the researcher works
with emancipatory intent]{.underline} (Lentin 1993, p. 128; Martin,
1996). [It is generally the researchers who produce the final text, the
written record of the research event. This gives them a power of
definition which cannot be abrogated at will. Moreover, the very efforts
of those interested in transforming the relations of research production
(from those of dominance to those of partnership or emancipation) are
deeply implicated in the exercise of power. One cannot escape the
reality of power relations even within the language of emancipation. In
addition, intellectuals work in institutions which lay down working
conditions based on the dominant meritocratic principles of our time ---
ostensibly at least, promotion is based on merit. The way in which merit
is measured is in terms of conformity to the dominant norms of
intellectual and academic discourse. This includes not only writing with
the dominant paradigm]{.underline} (Kuhn, 1961) [but writing about what
is currently intellectually fashionable]{.underline}. [Without at least
a nodding recognition of the importance of the dominant discourses, then
one's work is not likely to be published.6 And it is through their
publications that intellectuals in universities are generally
assessed.]{.underline} While "there is something desperate in the
docility with which "free intellectuals" rush to hand in their essays on
the required subject of the moment" (Bourdieu, 1993, p. 43) [the fact
remains that academics jobs and incomes are often dependent on such
conformity. **Not only does the academy generally only recognise those
who conform to the intellectual norms of the day, it penalises those who
attempt to redefine the purpose of the academy**]{.underline}. Lectures,
consultations and involvements with nonacademic bodies do not count in
terms of the enumerations of one's work or achievements.7 [This acts as
a very effective control on academic work limiting and containing
interests within the safe confines of the university. It also works
effectively to preclude intellectuals from involving themselves, and the
university, in radicalising initiatives.]{.underline} While "established
or tenured" academics can afford to indulge in such developments,
sanctioning via limited promotional opportunities continues to exercise
control even over these. Yet, public lectures and involvements with
voluntary, statutory, community and other organisations is essential if
research findings are to be circulated outside the narrow confines of
the academy. Given that the production of scientific knowledge generally
is often legitimated on the grounds that it will contribute to progress,
and to the ultimate general good of humanity, it is difficult to see how
this can happen without the dissemination of the findings outside the
academy in accessible contexts and language. What is interesting about
the boundary maintenance which goes on in universities is that it is not
confined to any one field (Bernstein, 1971). It occurs within and
between disciplines, and between the university itself and the "outside
community". **[Academic knowledge is defined as "superior" knowledge.
The fact that the academic perspective is only one viewpoint, and that
it may need to be complemented by other forms of understanding by
non-academic research subjects is largely ignored]{.underline}**
(Lather, 1986). [The parameters within which academic dialogue takes
place, therefore, are narrowly defined thereby inhibiting criticism of
academic discourse itself, and prohibiting academics from understanding
the world from the perspectives of the "other" outside the
academy]{.underline}

### Turn -- Disciplinary Power

#### The politicization of identity requires categorization -- generates disciplinary regimes which neutralize differences within identity categories and reinscribes relations of domination

**Brown, 1995.** (Wendy, Professor of Political Science and Rhetoric at
UC-Berkeley, *States of Injury: Power and Freedom in Late Modernity*,
published by Princeton UP, p. 65-66; spp)

[**Contemporary [politicized identity is]{.mark} also potentially
[reiterative of regulatory]{.mark}**,]{.underline}¶ [disciplinary
society in its configuration of a disciplinary subject.]{.underline}¶
[It is **[both produced by and potentially accelerates]{.mark} the
[production of]{.mark} that**]{.underline}**¶ [[aspect of]{.mark}
[disciplinary society which \"ceaselessly characterizes,
classifies,]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶ [and
specializes]{.underline}]{.mark}[,\"]{.underline}** [which works through
\"surveillance, continuous registration,]{.underline}¶ [perpetual
assessment, and classification,\" through a social
machinery]{.underline}¶ [\"**[that is both immense and
minute]{.mark}**]{.underline}. \"19 An example from the¶ world of local
politics makes clear politicized identity\'s imbrication in¶
disciplinary power, as well as the way in which, as Foucault reminds
us,¶ disciplinary power \"infiltrates\" rather than replaces liberal
juridical¶ modalities. 20¶ Recently, the city council of my town
reviewed an ordinance, devised¶ and promulgated by a broad coalition of
identity-based political groups,¶ which aimed to ban discrimination in
employment, housing, and public¶ accommodations on the basis of
\"**[sexual orientation, transsexuality, age,¶ height, weight, personal
appearance, physical characteristics, race, color,¶ creed, religion,
national origin, ancestry, disability, marital status, sex, or¶ gender.
\"]{.underline}**21 Here is a perfect instance of the universal
juridical ideal of¶ liberalism and the normalizing principle of
disciplinary regimes conjoined¶ and taken up within the discourse of
politicized identity. This¶ ordinance-variously called the \"purple hair
ordinance\" or the \"ugly ordinance\" by state and national news
media-aims to count every difference¶ as no difference, as part of the
seamless whole, but also to count¶ every potentially subversive
rejection of culturally enforced norms as¶ themselves normal, as
normalizable, and as normativizable through law.¶ Indeed[, through the
definitional, procedural, and remedies sections]{.underline} of¶ this
ordinance (e.g., \"**[sexual [orientation shall mean known or
assumed]{.mark}¶ [homosexuality]{.mark}, [heterosexuality]{.mark}, or
[bisexuality]{.mark}]{.underline}**\") [**persons** are [**reduced**
to]{.mark}]{.underline}¶ [observable socia**l [attributes and
practices]{.mark} [defined empirically,
positivistically]{.mark},**]{.underline}¶ [as if their existence were
intrinsic and factual, rather than]{.underline}¶ [effects of discursive
and institutional power; and these positivist definitions]{.underline}¶
[of persons as their attributes and practices are written into
law,]{.underline}¶ [ensuring that persons describable according to them
will now become]{.underline}¶ **[regulated through them]{.underline}**.
Bentham couldn\'t have done it better. Indeed,¶ here is a perfect
instance of how the language of recognition becomes the¶ language of
unfreedom, how [articulation in language, in the context
of]{.underline}¶ [liberal and disciplinary discourse, becomes a vehicle
of subordination]{.underline}¶ **[through individualization,
normalization, and regulation, even as it]{.underline}¶ [strives to
produce visibility and acceptance]{.underline}.** Here, also, is a
perfect instance¶ of the way in which \"**[[differences\" that are the
effects of social]{.underline}¶ [power are neutralized through their
articulation as attributes and their]{.underline}¶ [circulation through
liberal administrative discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}:** what do we make
of¶ a document that renders as juridical equivalents the denial of
employment¶ to an African American, an obese woman, and a white
middleclass¶ youth festooned with tattoos, a pierced tongue, and fuchsia
hair?

#### Disciplinary power is coercive and violent -- causes people to internalize their self-worth soley in terms of their productive capacities

**Foucault, 75** (1975. Michel, *Discipline and Punish* -- Second
Vintage Books Edition, 1995, p. 152-153; spp)

4\. The body-object articulation. [[Discipline
defines]{.underline}]{.mark} each of the [[relations]{.mark} that the
body [must have with the object]{.mark}]{.underline} that it
manipulates. Between them, it outlines a meticulous meshing. 'Bring the
weapon forward. In three stages. Raise the rifle with the right hand,
bringing it close to the body so as to hold it perpendicular with the
right knee, the end of the barrel at the eye level, grasping it by
striking it with the right hand, the arm held close to the body at waist
height. At the second stage, bring the rifle in front of you with the
left hand, the barrel in the middle between the two eyes, vertical, the
right hand grasping it at the small of the butt, the arm outstretched,
the trigger-guard resting on the first finger, the left hand at the
height of the notch, the thumb lying along the barrel against the
moulding. At the third stage, let go of the rifle with the left hand,
which falls along the thigh, raising the rifle with the right hand, the
lock outwards and opposite the chest, the right arm half flexed, the
elbow close to the body, the thumb lying against the lock, resting
against the first screw, the hammer resting on the first finger, the
barrel perpendicular' ('Ordonnance du janvier 1766..., titre XI, article
2'). ¶ This is an example of [what might be called the [instrumental
coding of the body]{.mark}.]{.underline} It consists in the breakdown of
the total gesture into two parallel series: that of the parts of the
body, to be used (right hand, left hand, different fingers of the hand,
knee, eye, elbow, etc.) and that of the parts of the object manipulated
(barrel, notch, hammer, screw, etc.); then the two sets of parts are
correlated together according to a number of simple gestures (rest,
bend); lastly, it fixes the canonical succession in which each of these
correlations occupies a particular place. This obligatory syntax is what
the military theoreticians of the eighteenth century called
\'manoeuvre\'. [The traditional recipe gives place to explicit and
obligatory prescriptions]{.underline}. Over the whole surface of contact
between the body and the object it handles, power is introduced,
fastening them to one another[. It [constitutes a body-weapon,
body-tool, body-machine complex]{.mark}]{.underline}. One is as far as
possible from those forms of subjection that demanded of the body only
signs or products, forms of expression or the result of labour. [The
regulation imposed by power is at the same time the law of construction
of the operation. Th[us disciplinary power appears to have the function
not so much of deduction as of synthesis, not so much of exploitation of
the product as of coercive link with the apparatus of
production.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Turn -- Reinstates Domination

#### Their performance of an ideal world mirrors a reversal of suffering without addressing subject constitution -- this reinstates the structure of oppression which they attempt to fight

**Brown, 1995**. (Wendy, Professor of Political Science and Rhetoric at
UC-Berkeley, *States of Injury: Power and Freedom in Late Modernity*,
published by Princeton UP, p. 7; spp)

But this opens rather than settles the problem of how to formulate a
discourse¶ of [freedom appropriate to contesting contemporary
antidemocratic]{.underline}¶ [configurations of power]{.underline}. One
of the ironies of what Nietzsche boldly¶ termed the **[\"[instinct for
freedom\" lies in its inceptive
self-cancellation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, its¶ crossing of itself in its
very first impulse. Initial figurations of
[[freedom]{.underline}]{.mark}¶ [[are inevitably reactionary]{.mark} in
the sense of emerging reaction to perceived]{.underline}¶ [injuries or
constraints of a regime from within its own terms.]{.underline}¶ Ideals
of freedom ordinarily emerge to vanquish their imagined immediate
enemies, but in this move they frequently recycle and reinstate¶ rather
than transform the terms of domination that generated them. Consider¶
[exploited workers who dream of a world in which work has
been]{.underline}¶ [abolished, blacks who imagine a world without
whites, **[feminists who]{.mark}**]{.underline}¶ [**[conjure a world
either without men or without sex]{.mark}, or** teenagers who,
fantasize]{.underline}¶ [a world without parents.]{.underline} Such
**[[images of freedom]{.underline}]{.mark}** perform **[[mirror
reversals of suffering without transforming the organization of the
activity]{.underline}]{.mark}**¶ through which the suffering is produced
and without addressing the subject¶ [constitution that domination
effects, that is, the constitution of the social categories, "workers,"
"blacks," "women," or "teenagers."]{.underline}¶ It would thus appear
that it is freedom's relationship to identity-its¶ promise to address a
social injury or marking that is itself constitutive of¶
[[identity]{.underline}]{.mark} -- that [[yields the paradox in which
the first imaginings of freedom]{.underline}]{.mark}¶ [[are always
constrained by and potentially even require the
very]{.underline}]{.mark}¶ [[structure of oppression that freedom
emerges to oppose]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Their attempt to order politics around women's freedom requires the specter of patriarchal unfreedom -- this locks in the power dynamic they criticize

**Brown, 1995.** (Wendy, Professor of Political Science and Rhetoric at
UC-Berkeley, *States of Injury: Power and Freedom in Late Modernity*,
published by Princeton UP, p. 8-9; spp)

Invoking Marx recalls a second dimension of this paradox in which¶
**[[freedom responds]{.mark} [to]{.mark} a particular practice of
dominati[on whose terms are]{.mark}¶ then often [reinstalled in its
practice]{.mark}.]{.underline}** When institutionalized,
[freedom]{.underline}¶ [premised upon an already vanquished
enemy]{.underline} keeps alive, in the manner¶ of [a melancholic
logic]{.underline}, a threat that works as domination in the form of¶ an
absorbing ghostly battle with the past. 7 Institutionalized, freedom
arrayed¶ ag[ainst a particular image of unfreedom sustains that image,
which]{.underline}¶ **[[dominates political life with its specter long
after it has been vanquished]{.underline}]{.mark}**¶ and preempts
appreciation of new dangers to freedom posed by institutions¶ designed
to hold the past in check. [Yet the very institutions that
are]{.underline}¶ [[erected to vanquish]{.mark} the historical threat
also [recuperate it as a form of]{.mark}]{.underline}¶ **[[political
anxiety]{.underline}]{.mark}**; so, for example[, [functions
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [\"**[state of nature]{.underline}**]{.mark}\"
or the¶ \"**[[arbitrary sovereign]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" in the
liberal political imagination.¶ It may be the extent to which freedom
institutionalized transmogrifies¶ into its opposite that led Foucault to
insist upon understanding liberty as¶ a practice rather than a state, as
that which can \"never \[be\] assured¶ by \... institutions and laws\"
but \"must be exercised. \"B Sheldon Wolin¶ presses a similar point in
his provocation that \"a constitution, in setting¶ limits to politics,
set limits as well to democracy \.... [Democracy thus]{.underline}¶
[seems destined to be a moment rather than a form.]{.underline} \"9 In
Jean-Luc¶ Nancy\'s account, \"[[freedom \... is the very thing that
prevents]{.mark} [itself]{.mark}]{.underline}¶ [[from being
founded]{.underline}]{.mark}. \'\' And a similar concern can be
discerned in¶ Hannah Arendt\'s insistence on the perniciousness of
equating freedom¶ with sovereignty, along with her counterproposition
that [[freedom as]{.underline}¶]{.mark}
\"**[[virtuosity]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" [[is defined by the
contingency of action]{.mark}, as the place where]{.underline}¶
\"**[[the I-will and the I-can coincide\" as
power.]{.underline}]{.mark}**11¶ Recognition of the tension, if not the
antinomy, between freedom and¶ institutionalization compounds the
difficulties of formulating a politics of¶ freedom in the late twentieth
century, the age of institutions. Not only¶ do we require a historically
and institutionally specific reading of contemporary¶ [modes of
domination, but freedom's \"actualization\" would]{.underline}¶ [appear
to be a frustratingly indeterminate matter of ethos, of
bearing]{.underline}¶ [[toward institutions, of the style of political
practices, rather than a matter]{.underline}¶ [of policies, laws,
procedures, or organization of political orders]{.underline}]{.mark}.
This is¶ not to say that freedom becomes aesthetic, but rather that it
depends¶ upon a formulation of the political that is richer, more
complicated, and¶ [[also perhaps more fragile than that circumscribed by
institutions, procedures, and political
representation.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### Cap Links -- Gender

#### Capitalism is the sole antagonism standing in the way of liberation. A singular focus on gender eschews a wider class based struggle cannot produce effective change. Only a unified and decisive blow to capitalism can rupture the patriarchy.

**Previato 02**- *In Defence of Marxism* -- launched in 1998 -- has
become one of the world\'s foremost sources of Marxist theory, analysis
on current events and the history of the revolutionary workers'
movement. https://www.marxist.com/marxism-feminism-womens-day101002.htm

In 1808, in his *Theory of four movements*, Fourier explained that
\"social progress is measured by the progress of the woman towards
freedom\". Later, Marx and Engels analysed the development of human
society in detail, not only from the economic viewpoint but also
culturally and in the relationship between the sexes. **[Marxism
analysed the origin of women\'s oppression and laid the theoretical
basis for overcoming it]{.underline}**. In particular Engels, in *The
Origins of the Family, Private Property and the State* (1884[), starting
from the scientific and anthropological knowledge of that time, showed
the dynamic nature of social structures and how these structures are
linked to the level of development of the productive
forces]{.underline}. \"The increase of production in all branches -
cattle-raising, agriculture, domestic handicrafts - gave human
labour-power the capacity to produce a larger product than was necessary
for its maintenance. (...) As to how and when the herds passed out of
the common possession of the tribe or the gens into the ownership of
individual heads of families, we know nothing at present. But in the
main it must have occurred during this stage. With the herds and the
other new riches, a revolution came over the family. To procure the
necessities of life had always been the business of the man; he produced
and owned the means of doing so. The herds were the new means of
producing these necessities; the taming of the animals in the first
instance and their later tending were the man\'s work. To him,
therefore, belonged the cattle, and to him the commodities and the
slaves received in exchange for cattle. All the surplus which the
acquisition of the necessities of life now yielded fell to the man; the
woman shared in its enjoyment, but had no part in its ownership. The
\"savage\" warrior and hunter had been content to take second place in
the house, after the woman; the \"gentler\" shepherd, in the arrogance
of his wealth, pushed himself forward into the first place and the woman
down into the second. And she could not complain. (...) \"The man now
being actually supreme in the house, the last barrier to his absolute
supremacy had fallen. This autocracy was confirmed and perpetuated by
the overthrow of mother-right, the introduction of father-right, and the
gradual transition of the pairing marriage into monogamy. But this tore
a breach in the old gentile order; the single family became a power, and
its rise was a menace to the gens.(1) (Fredrick Engels, *Origins of the
Family, Private Property, and the State*, Chapter IX: Barbarism and
Civilization.) Since these ancient origins, women have been looked on as
inferior beings. A contemporary of Marx in Italy, the abbot Rosmini,
inspired the upbringing of many "young ladies" from good families and
appealed to nature to emphasise their age-old subjection to men: \"It is
for the husband, according to the convenience of nature, to be lord and
master; it is for the woman, and so it should be, to be almost an
appendage, a complement to the husband, entirely consecrated to him and
dominated by his name"(2). These theories may cause some amusement and
sound out of date, but they formed the basis for family law in Italy
right up until 1975, when it was finally reformed after very hard
struggles. [While struggles and debates have arisen around this question
in many moments in history, the rise of capitalism marked a decisive
transition which radically changed the relations between
individuals]{.underline}. Liberation outside the walls of the home As
Engels explains, [**the oppression of the woman within the household was
the result of change outside it**. To the degree in which the labour of
the man, linked to herding and agriculture, began to produce the wealth
of those societies by producing a surplus over and above family needs,
which was \"sold\", domestic labour ceased to be the fundamental
wealth**. It was of a private nature, could not be exchanged for other
goods on the market and thus lost its value. The labour of the man,
whose products were exchanged for gain, became productive, while that of
the woman, whose product was not for sale, became
unproductive**]{.underline}. This change outside the family marked an
overturning of the balance of forces within it. To quote Engels again:
\"**[We can already see from this that to emancipate woman and make her
the equal of the man is and remains an impossibility so long as the
woman is shut out from social productive labor and restricted to private
domestic labor. The emancipation of woman will only be possible when
woman can take part in production on a large, social scale, and domestic
work no longer claims anything but an insignificant amount of her
time]{.underline}**. And only now has that become possible through
modern large-scale industry, which does not merely permit of the
employment of female labor over a wide range, but positively demands it,
while it also tends towards ending private domestic labor by changing it
more and more into a public industry.\"(3) (Fredrick Engels, *Origins of
the Family, Private Property, and the State*, Chapter IX: Barbarism and
Civilization.) [The development of the capitalist mode of production
actually had important repercussions on all women, from those of the
upper classes to proletarian women]{.underline}. It was precisely the
processes explained by Engels which pushed bourgeois women, and even
some from the nobility, to demand more rights, and, as we shall attempt
to clarify here by describing some of the struggles at the turn of the
19th-20th centuries, to shake up consciousness and the social system.
The class struggle and the struggle against patriarchal society
**[However, the capitalist mode of production marked an irreconcilable
break between the interests of the exploited and the exploiters. The
capitalist system pushes the individual to find a role in social
production.]{.underline}** Thus not only did bourgeois women come out of
their \"gilded prisons\" to demand a seat in Parliament or a place in
male professions, but also millions of peasant women and housewives were
thrust by want into large-scale production: **[the factory, the mill,
the mine, the office and the call center have become the place of a
further form of oppression: class oppression.]{.underline}** [This
second burden, however, brings them out of the solitude of the four
walls, gives them the chance to find other female and male comrades in
the fight against their exploited position, become protagonists in their
own lives, break their subjection to men and strike a blow against
patriarchal society.]{.underline} The whole experience of women
workers\' struggles teaches just this: the struggle in the workplace is
always accompanied by a crisis in the family, with men looking
suspiciously on the new female protagonism while women, gaining
confidence in their abilities, no longer put up with abuse and ridicule
by fathers, husbands and brothers. Entry into the world of labour, the
earning of a wage and, ultimately, the class conflict, do not
automatically lead to the liberation of the woman, but communists who
set themselves this aim must understand the connection between these two
aspects; it is the class conflict that most clearly reveals to women in
general the reactionary nature of the family as a place where
individuals, and especially women and children, suffer oppression.
Communists must take advantage of this objective condition to put
forward a different idea of how human beings can live together, based on
the socialisation of economic resources, of household tasks, of the care
and upbringing of children. But [above all]{.underline} they must make
it clear **[that the cause of the tensions and violence that are part of
daily family life lies in the private nature of the responsibilities
that capitalism necessarily unloads onto the shoulders of the family and
of women in particular. So breaking women's oppression, breaking down
this private character, means making the struggle for women\'s
liberation part of the struggle against capitalism]{.underline}**.
Taking up the women\'s question is not just an extra, but a decisive
issue which brings the struggle against capitalism onto more advanced
ground. Communists do not fight this system only because it forces three
quarters of the world into the most inhuman poverty, but also because it
is a brake on the development of culture, science and human resources,
and from a simple brake it is transforming itself more and more into a
system leading to barbarism in human relationships even in the advanced
capitalist countries. Thus the battle is also an ideological one. The
nature of feminism Up to now we have avoided using the term feminism in
relation to the struggle of the women\'s movement and we believe that a
few clarifications are needed concerning this term. It was Fourier who
first spoke of feminism, giving the term a positive value as it meant
the struggle of women against their oppression. However, historically
the term has been taken over basically by movements with a bourgeois or
petty bourgeois leadership, often coming into conflict with the labour
movement and its organisations. [The feminist movement, particularly
after the Second World War, produced ideas and analyses which were
unquestionably valid, and in some cases adopted revolutionary Marxist
ideas. **However, the fact remains that overall it remained a prisoner
of a reductionist view of the women\'s question, which saw it as a
central battle with all women being lumped together regardless of their
social background and separately from all other struggles**]{.underline}
(wages, social conditions, etc.). While it is true that the denial of
rights affects women of different social classes, there is an enormous
gap between the conditions of women, according to the class they belong
to, and this distance is inevitably reproduced in the aims they set
themselves. First of all there is the question of property. Bourgeois
women have to look after their own and their family's and acquaintances'
property. Proletarian women, with their class demands, together with
their demands as women, are a constant threat to bourgeois property,
which is challenged not only by the programme of the labour movement
(which may be more or less advanced) but particularly by the methods of
struggle (strikes, occupations, etc.) and the mass character of these
struggles. Secondly there is the problem of the goals of the struggle.
Historically the feminist movement has had many different expressions
which we will analyse later in this text. Here we will try to summarise
these objectives: the central theme for bourgeois women in the feminist
movement is the cultural battle. At the beginning of the 20th century
this was expressed in the extension of democratic rights, such as the
right to vote, the right to study and access to the \"male\" professions
(lawyers, doctors etc.), but it later found its demands in female
protagonism and against a Catholic culture which saw the woman as the
\"angel of the hearth\" (divorce, abortion rights). This cultural battle
was often accompanied by a strong verbal radicalism and also by
\"exemplary\" actions aimed at showing the revolutionary and universal
character of those demands. Basically, however, although democratic
rights for women are universal, in other words they involve everyone,
posing the cultural struggle separately from the economic system gives
this battle a partial character. It may have striking effects but does
not undermine the system. Hence the eternal debate as to whether we
should demand women\'s emancipation or liberation. The most moderate
sections of the movement naturally limited themselves to demanding a few
adjustments to women\'s conditions, campaigning for a more or less slow
emancipation process. Other sections, which were more radical but often
more confused, demanded a genuine liberation, but did not understand
that to achieve this they had to go beyond the narrow limits of feminism
and take part in a broad struggle against capitalism, putting forward a
more radical, revolutionary programme within the workers\' movement.
Working women and patriarchal ideology On the other hand, for women
workers, their oppression within the home is interwoven with social
conditions. For women workers this is represented by the suffocation of
housework and child-minding. Unlike bourgeois women they cannot unload
these chores onto wage labour (baby-sitters, maids, etc). Over the last
few decades in the advanced countries there has been a certain
involvement of men in looking after the children and in housework, but
the ultimate responsibility continues to rest on the shoulders of the
woman. In the poorer layers and the working class this responsibility is
even greater, as capitalist society has no interest in socializing it.
This situation changes the role of the woman, and particularly the woman
worker, in society; time is dedicated to the house, the children,
running the house in general at the expense of study, union activity,
politics, improvement of working conditions etc. However, as opposed to
bourgeois women, working class women, although they are also oppressed
by their men, are forced to take a more tortuous and laborious path to
free themselves. The men of their social class do not have a nice,
well-paid profession for them to envy or compete for. Although men
workers on average are better paid than women workers, it is still wage
labour. What remains is a couple and family life which is unsustainable
from a human and economic viewpoint, and inevitably goes into crisis.
And here too we see the greatest difficulties affecting women workers;
for them the prospect of divorce means having to face life as a single
person, probably with children (who in 98% of cases go to the mother),
on a starvation wage and with an extra rent to pay. Capitalism imposes
on the women the double burden of work outside and inside the home. When
this burden is unbearable no solution is offered except more loneliness
and a disrupted social life. About half of households in Italy are no
longer of the traditional type (father, mother, child/children); in most
cases they are women desperately looking for a way to emancipation from
family oppression, but while they may escape from their obligations
towards a husband, they cannot escape the women's role that capitalism
in any case thrusts upon them. The care of the children remains,
discrimination in the workplace remains, economic need remains and even
increases, as does the need for human solidarity, but here the division
of roles by sex is once more reproduced. Women workers, unlike middle
class women, can react to this loneliness of oppression suffered in
private by taking up a role in struggles in their workplace. [The class
struggle is a collective struggle and demonstrates the power of women
workers, increasing their confidence in their abilities and helping to
make broad layers of the female working class aware of their oppressed
condition as women in society, showing how collective action can combat
the oppression of women too.]{.underline} In order for this to be
expressed in a conscious struggle for their own liberation, a
revolutionary analysis and programme are needed. But the reformist
organizations of the labour movement have gone from a sometimes openly
hostile attitude (consider the Italian socialists who opposed the vote
for women) to posing the problem in an exclusively economic manner
(equal pay, conditions, hours etc.), without taking up the revolutionary
implications of the struggle against women's oppression and even
claiming that the problem was something concerning exclusively middle
class women. Subsequently, in the absence of an independent class
analysis, the reformist leaders capitulated completely to feminist
conceptions, adopting the ideas and demands of the most moderate
sections. To this it should be added that the feminist movement has
always looked on women workers as "second-class sisters", partly because
they were less open to its arguments and partly because they were looked
on as practically irretrievable victims of male domination of the
workers' organizations. This attitude of self-sufficiency is shown by
the almost complete absence of writings about the struggles of working
class women, compared with a far greater number of publications about
the strictly feminist movement, not to mention the deafening silence
surrounding women's conquests in the Soviet Union thanks to the October
Revolution. Feminism and the workers' movement Having said this, we must
seek a correct relationship between feminism and the labour movement and
between the conflict between the sexes and the class struggle. [While
the women's question must be taken up by communists, as explained
above]{.underline}, **[we must oppose a partial approach which places
the cultural battle at the centre of our campaigns, independently of
class origin.]{.underline}** **[This approach causes a lowering of the
consciousness with which women approach their condition, where women can
see only a description of their oppression without being offered the
means to overcome it.]{.underline}** As we have explained, [women's
oppression did not originate with capitalism, but the existence of
capitalism represents the decisive obstacle to overcoming
it.]{.underline} [This system is obliged to base its rule on the
oppression of the working class and so has to encourage all possible
divisions within it. The patriarchal ideology is fundamental to
guarantee a wide layer of female labour where it can impose inferior
wages and conditions, and who can enter and leave the labour market as
needed, acting as a constant downward pressure on the wages and
conditions of the whole working class.]{.underline} In exactly the same
way, racism is used to divide the working class on race lines. Thus,
although capitalism thrusts women into social production, along with
immigrants from the more backward areas of the world, it must at the
same time promote the idea that a woman's duty is to stay at home to
look after her children and family. Thus **[capitalism]{.underline}**,
along with its church ideologues, **[has become the fundamental
instigator of women's oppression]{.underline}**. For anyone dealing with
the women's question, [it is an inescapable task to expose this link,
showing how the patriarchal culture is used and promoted by capitalism
to maintain its rule. Any struggle that does not take this into account
is not only doomed to defeat, but will be incapable of orienting women
workers and those middle class women who do not just want to adjust
their conditions but aspire to genuine liberation]{.underline}. Finally
we must deal with the reasons why **[the class struggle has a central
place in comparison with the struggle between the sexes]{.underline}**.
Firstly, from what we have said so far, it is clear that liberating the
woman, or at least creating a basis for her liberation, means first of
all liberating the economic resources to enable the socialization of
housework and child-minding, chores which tie women to their
responsibilities and to their role as women in society. Freeing these
resources means coming into conflict with private ownership of the means
of production, with the ruling class. It means posing the need for a
revolutionary process towards socialism, with the taking of power by the
working class; the nationalisation of the multinationals and of the
commanding heights of the economy with the planning of these resources
under the control of the masses who are exploited today. Only in such a
context, in a socialist society, could they be used for the benefit of
the masses themselves. The central position of the working class in this
process is determined by its role in social production, by the fact that
the workers, as a class of wage labourers, enable capitalism to function
and exist, even though they may not be aware of this power in normal
times. Their involvement is therefore decisive so that their strength
can become a conscious force, able to challenge the established order.
This central position has recently been disputed in the left, by those
who argue that there are other equally important conflicts, such as
precisely the conflict between the sexes, or over the environment. Here
[**we are not questioning the importance of these issues. What we are
stressing is what is the central contradiction round which all the other
contradictions turn**. The women's question, like the environment,
cannot be solved independently from the abolition of capitalism, a
system which is now incapable of guaranteeing a harmonious development
for women and for humankind in general. In addition it is not possible
to conduct a cultural battle without posing the central question of
breaking the motor force of this culture and overthrowing the ruling
class which expresses its interests through that culture]{.underline}.
Thus it falls on the shoulders of the working class, which has the
potential, as explained above, and the responsibility to carry out these
tasks which the capitalist system cannot guarantee, starting now also an
ideological campaign, first of all among women workers themselves and
then, once power has been conquered, implementing our proposals for
liberation. The brief notes which follow are of a mainly historical
nature and aim to illustrate the ideas set out above. As we have already
stated, we are interested in pointing out both the validity and the
limitations of the middle class movements internationally, among the
most important of which was the British suffragettes movement, but for
reasons of space we will be concentrating on the Italian experience.

[In attempting to expound upon the thinking behind poststructuralist
feminism]{.underline}, Alcoff explains, "[The mechanism of power
referred to here is the construction of the subject by a discourse that
weaves knowledge and power into a coercive structure...on this view,
essentialist formulations of womanhood, even when made by feminists,
'tie' the individual to her identity as a woman and thus cannot
represent a solution to sexism]{.underline}." 94 The problem with this
view, when it is applied to social and political movements, is that it
places the individual's ability and desire to subjectively create and
design their own identity and purpose as the highest moral good - there
is not higher order or meaning beyond what the individual creates as
part of their autonomous and non-essential identity. As Alcoff explains,
"[The political struggle can have only a 'negative function:' rejecting
'everything finite, definite, structured, loaded with meaning, in the
existing state of society]{.underline}.'"95 Such a view might be helpful
when addressing individual psychological or social difficulties, but [it
is a problematic way to lead a social movement and a destructive way to
lead people in understanding their role in a social, humane
world]{.underline}. Alcoff's criticism is rooted in the philosophically
challenging aspect of such a view: "Applied to the concept of woman the
poststructuralist's view
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 93 Ibid, 8. 94
Ibid. 95 Ibid, 11. 48 results in what I shall call nominalism: the idea
that the category of 'woman' is a fiction and that feminist efforts must
be directed toward dismantling this fiction."96 Alcoff explains that the
appeal of post-structuralism to feminist thinkers is twofold: "First, it
seems to hold out the promise of an increased freedom for women, the
'free play' of a plurality of differences unhampered by any
predetermined gender identity as formulated by either patriarchy or
cultural feminism. Second, it moves decisively beyond cultural feminism
and liberal feminism in further theorizing what they leave untouched:
the construction of subjectivity."97 Interestingly, Alcoff notes the
extent to which poststructuralist feminism is a direct descendent of
classical liberal views on the individual: "Despite rumblings from the
Continent, Anglo-American thought is still wedded to the ideal of a
universalizable, apolitical methodology and set of transhistorical basic
truths unfettered by associations with particular genders, races,
classes, or cultures." 98 **[Alcoff sees the generic human idea,
promoted in Enlightenment thinking, as closely related to
post-structuralism's designation of "individual particularities such as
subjective experience as a social construct," and claims that
"post-structuralism's negation of the authority of the subject coincides
nicely with the classical liberal's view that human particularities are
irrelevant]{.underline}**. (For the liberal, race, class, and gender are
ultimately irrelevant to questions of justice and truth because
'underneath we are all the same.')" Perhaps Alcoff's most relevant and
pressing question is the one that points to the primary problem facing
any proponent of poststructuralist feminism: "A feminist
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 96 Ibid. 97
Ibid. 98 Ibid, 13. 49 adoption of nominalism will be confronted with the
same problem theories of ideology have, that is, Why is a right-wing
woman's consciousness constructed via social discourse but a feminist's
consciousness is not?"99 It has been recognized by many feminists in
academia that disagreements among feminists are cause for concern,
especially those who wish to see feminist ideas of any form succeed. The
editors of Conflicts in Feminism note in their introduction that, While
feminists have in principle tended to agree that difference is a more
productive theoretical and political category than either universalizing
consensus or divisive oppositions, in practice, actual differences
within feminist discourse have tended to erupt into separate camps. At
this moment in time, some of these conflicts have proven so divisive
that they seem to foreclose rather than stimulate debate, even at times
appearing to threaten the very viability of contemporary feminism as a
political and theoretical venture.100 The problems that result from such
a stifling intellectual climate are apparent not only to those dealing
with feminism in theory, but also among those putting it into practice
in the classroom or in the public sphere. The editors of Conflicts in
Feminism also echo Alcoff's observation that "A common divide keeps
forming in both feminist thought and action between the need to build
the identity 'woman' and give it solid political meaning and the need to
tear down the very category 'woman' and dismantle its all-too-solid
history."101 They recognize that neither approach is without fault:
social construction does not seem plausible to the average person, and
"to assert that the body has no enduring, natural language often
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 99 Ibid, 12. 100
Marianne Hirsch and Evelyn Fox Keller, "Introduction," Conflicts in
Feminism, (New York: Routledge, 1990), 4. 101 Ann Snitow, "A Gender
Diary," in Conflicts in Feminism, 9. 50 seems like a rejection of common
sense."102 Not only is it a tough sell to a mainstream audience, but
also the poststructuralist approach is logically problematic, in that
"By definition social construction theory cannot offer a securely
bounded area for the study of gender; instead it initiates an inspiring
collapse of gender verities."103 Alcoff offers a similar sentiment,
asking, "[If gender is simply a social construct, the need and even the
possibility of a feminist politics becomes immediately problematic. What
can we demand in the name of women if 'women' do not exist and demands
in their name simply reinforce the myth that they do?"]{.underline}104
**[Such an approach eventually leads to an almost nihilistic
nothingness - a void in which there is no need for women's liberation
because women do not exist.]{.underline}** The editors also touch on an
important dichotomy in feminist thought, somewhat analogous to Alcoff's
cultural feminism and poststructuralist feminism: Equality and
difference are broad ideas and have included a rrange of definitions and
political expressions. Equality, for example, can mean anything from the
mildest liberal reform to the most radical reduction of gender to
insignificance. Difference can mean anything from Mary Daly's belief in
the natural superiority of women to psychoanalytic theories of how women
are inevitably cast as "the Other" because they lack penises.105
Clearly, even within two polarized categories - equality and difference
feminism - there are still more opportunities for polarization and
disagreement. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Post-Structuralism: The Identity Crisis in Feminist Theory," 13. 105 Ann
Snitow, "A Gender Diary," in Conflicts in Feminism, 26. 51 It is clear
from Alcoff's essay and from the essays in Conflicts in Feminism that
**[this issue is deeply troubling for feminists who are committed to an
academic and logically sound feminism that is rooted in reality: A
subjectivity that is fundamentally shaped by gender appears to lead
irrevocably to essentialism, the posing of a male/female opposition as
universal and ahistorical.]{.underline}** **[A subjectivity that is not
fundamentally shaped by gender appears to lead to the conception of a
generic human subject, as if we could peel away our 'cultural' layers
and get to the real root of human nature, which turns out to be
genderless.]{.underline}** Are these really our only choices?106 I argue
that they are not the only choices, and that both cultural feminism and
poststructuralist feminism adhere to and even depend fundamentally on an
underlying and flawed liberation from essence view. [The problem with
the liberation from essence view, as it is found in]{.underline} both
cultural feminism and [poststructuralist feminism, is that, in dealing
with issues of broader social and political relevance, it ultimately
places the individual's autonomy and subjectivity as the highest moral
good.]{.underline} Whether it follows the cultural feminist line of
thinking, which views women's interests and men's interests in
opposition to each other and does not presuppose or allow for any mutual
interests or synergy beyond the individual woman or man's happiness, or
the poststructuralist feminist's view of denying the category of "woman"
in the first place, neither view takes larger societal goods into
consideration. Neither view considers a purpose outside of the
individual's own identity, self-definition in relation to community or
tradition, and subjective experience in the world.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 106 Linda
Alcoff, "Cultural Feminism Versus Post-Structuralism: The Identity
Crisis in Feminist Theory," 16. 52 While such views may have value in a
therapeutic or psychological setting, they are destructive ways to view
social interactions and to interpret one's role in society and
relationships and duties to others. Cultural feminism sees masculinity
and femininity as "at war," and can be traced to the type of matriarchal
feminism promoted by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, while [poststructuralist
feminism faces serious logical inconsistencies that threaten to
eliminate the notion of women in the first place.]{.underline} Hoff
Sommers' offers a more classical liberal and moderate feminism centered
on freedom and individual liberties. Thus, we have three primary schools
of feminist thought to consider. There are the two that are accepted on
the left: poststructuralist feminism and cultural (matriarchal)
feminism. Then there is the more right leaning blend of freedom and
maternal feminism promoted by Hoff Sommers. This chapter has identified
the difficulties that contemporary feminists face in attempting to
develop an underlying philosophical impetus for the movement; next I
will consider how they are addressing feminism as an academic discipline
with a role in educational institutions.

### Cap Links -- Identity Politics

#### Neoliberalism must be addressed before the aff's identity politics---their performance only gets coopted by the capitalist system otherwise

**Pook 18** (Zooey Sophia, "QUEER IS THE NEW CAPITALISM: NEOLIBERAL
TECHNOLOGIES AND A BLUEPRINT FOR THE LEFT BEYOND IDENTITY POLITICS,"
Dissertation for a PhD in Philosophy, New Mexico State University)

Although Butler and company have made it clear that they do not wish to
put the burden of social change on the backs of the least off, instead,
carefully relegating their actions as potential strategies for
academics, there does at least seem to be a kind of sensationalism that
appears, at the very least, as an effect of such inquiries. Similarly,
it is important to note efforts taken by Butler to delegitimize the
flimsy perceptions of agency drawn from Gender Trouble that were
addressed, most notably, in Bodies That Matter, and through the addition
of her concept of precarity, which I will specifically address in the
following chapter. In Bodies that Matter, Butler reiterates and
strengthens her claim that performativity is not a matter of personal
choice but of a subject already decided through the
repetition/regularization of cultural norms (p. x). In Dispossession,
[performativity is compounded by the notion of precarity and the ways
different bodies are specifically dispossessed in relation to neoliberal
power.]{.underline} But even with these updates and nuances, the central
tenants and problems of performativity and performative transgression
remain, as does the impact of Gender Trouble, whether read thoughtfully
or otherwise. This is the reason that I took the time to offer evidence
of the specificities of the kinds of performative being done- so a
reasonable analysis could be made about the ethics and effectiveness of
performativity and identity-based politics when considering the
situations of queer bodies. [For the majority of women and gender
studies students privileged and 62 educated enough to make sense of
these works, reading about poor transgender inmates and impoverished
queer people of color, for example, written by presumably safe and
comfortable academics, lends itself to a kind of utopian thinking where
the revolution is to come from a distressed and magical "other" at the
deepest and darkest margins of our culture.]{.underline} And this is
obvious enough if you've spent any time in a cultural studies department
or in an LGBT center on most college campuses in the United States, as
much excitement is generated from the possibilities of queer bodies
serving as resistance tools. One should not underplay the excitement
they had the first time reading Judith Butler as an undergrad, after
all. In response, I think it is fair to say that queer theorists engaged
in these projects would echo something not unlike Patricia Hill Collin's
(2004) defense of feminist standpoint theory- that it is more about the
social conditions that a group faces than individual experiences (p.
247), but [it is hard not to see how the damage is done.]{.underline}
This is why Uma Naryan (2004) warns theorists of acquiring a kind of
"double vision" where [we transfer some kind of magical notions of truth
and revolutionary knowledge to those who are most oppressed by the
social forces and institutions we pit ourselves against]{.underline} (p.
233). This is an ironic twist because it seems not unlike the high
theory equivalent of figures like "the magical negro" and others who
have been well noted by cultural theorists as minority figures in works
of popular culture who exist solely to advance the white narrative of a
film, often completely devoid and separate from the logic of the film
(Glenn, 2009). These are important points to consider because of the
condition of LGBT+ people in the United States and in the world, as
transgender people, 63 specifically, face enormous wealth disparities
and are the target of murder on a quite disproportionate level (Longo,
2017). The challenges and institutional hardships of LGBT+ people are,
of course, also exacerbated for LGBT+ people of color and for women,
especially non-cisgender women. [What should be raised at this point,
are serious questions of ethics- both of the researcher in engaging such
populations for political and strategic purposes and for readers and
activists interested in drawing tactical conclusions from, or in tandem,
with the group of inquiry.]{.underline} If we compare the previous works
mentioned to similar works in Sociology, for examples, such as
Unspeakable Love: Gay and Lesbian Life in the Middle East or Kristen
Schilt and Laurel Westbrook's "Doing Gender, Doing Heteronormativity:
'Gender Normal's,' Transgender People and the Social Maintenance of
Heteroesexuality," we see much more careful attempts to make light of
sensitive issues such as gay and lesbian experience in the middle east,
violence towards transgender women, and the experience of transgender
men in the workplace, followed by pragmatic examination of policy and
law and their possibilities. This is far removed from the kind of
sensationalizing or drawing undo political consequence or importance
from the other's body or experiences, despite being analysis bom of the
same kind of inquiry and concern. Beyond what Hill-Collins proclaims
about examining the shared social conditions of a group, [it is more
worthwhile to turn to the conditions of power themselves, as doing so
will reveal a shift in the forms and distributions of neoliberal power,
and more importantly, the changing technologies through which our lives
are mediated. At such a time, identity politics will really be beside
the point, and 64 performativity will need to be reassessed as a process
of digital appropriation]{.underline}. Queer theorists have long been
engaged in a kind of project to flesh out Foucault's Discipline and
Punish, acknowledging that while all bodies are disciplined by
institutions and social formations of the state, they aren't done so
equally. Here, each scholar takes a turn yelling out a different
minority group to which the specific particularities of oppression will
be examined, along with the possibilities of resistance that coincide.
It is probably long past time to turn back and diagnose power again;
things have changed. Ironically, Foucault did this in very meaningful
ways in his later work, arguing powerfully against self-identification
and distinctions of gender and sexual identity he saw as problematically
developing in the aftermath of '68 (1978). It is, after all, one of
Foucault's major accomplishments, from his very earliest works, to
illuminate the connection between the emergence of positive knowledge of
human bodies and the corresponding institutional techniques that would
follow to manage them (Behrent, 2013, p. 77). Now, [it is neoliberalism
in full bloom, and its technologies of appropriation that we must
address against identity-based political resistances.]{.underline} The
kind of compelled disclosure that Foucault draws a history of in the
confessional and in medicine is now a relation of culture; [it is
decentralized and surrounds us, comprising our activity on the internet
and between each other. The expectation of offering or being asked for a
preferred pronoun in the transgender community is a serious example of
this. Such an expectation transcends trust and autonomy thus reproducing
the demands of information capital, rather than allowing identity to
emerge or to not emerge on one's own terms.]{.underline} [Shannon
Winnubst's (2012) 65 work, for example, which utilizes the work of
Foucault from this period to draw critique of the new ontological
condition that neoliberalism produces is a useful and important work
linking identity studies to postfordist being is particularly necessary
in cultural studies, as is transcends the gap between technology, micro
and macro political concerns, and locates neoliberal power via their
connection]{.underline}

#### The AFF's identity politics only serve as a distraction from challenging capitalism---and even worse, the distraction does nothing to solve for structural inequalities at all. 

**Pook 18** (Zooey Sophia, "QUEER IS THE NEW CAPITALISM: NEOLIBERAL
TECHNOLOGIES AND A BLUEPRINT FOR THE LEFT BEYOND IDENTITY POLITICS,"
Dissertation for a PhD in Philosophy, New Mexico State University)

Identity politics have altered the way we speak about politics and in
what ways[. Neoliberalism does not employ the exclusionary tactics of
the disciplinary age, but embraces diversity and inclusion as a means to
neutralize hostis and to flatten 94 identity into a singular postfordist
way of being. Discipline today is an interpersonal tool of neoliberal
culture, in which individuals may take up the baton of political
correctness and become an honorary member of the p.c. police,
challenging inflammatory and discriminatory language, while also serving
the goals of neoliberal order]{.underline}. Dean (2009) writes, quoting
Zizek, The true victory (the true 'negation of the negation') occurs
when the enemy talks your language. In this sense, a true victory is a
victory in defeat. It occurs when one's specific message is accepted as
a universal ground, even by the enemy, (p. 7) [The true victory of the
post-1968 Left is the instatement of a universal language of neoliberal
multiculturalism]{.underline}. Is this not what presents itself in all
facets of culture today? [A superficial respect of difference is
afforded and policed omnipotently.]{.underline} A TV host makes a racist
or sexist comment and he is fired. A store clerk tells a transgender
woman she can't use a restroom and the store is boycotted and put out of
business. A movie does not promote women in the right way and it's
written about in a well-read blog and it flops in theaters. [Meanwhile,
the institutional injustices suffered by queer, black, and female bodies
remain untouched. Identity politics serve neoliberalism because they
orient us towards pacifism, and a focus on interpersonal abuses,
reducing politics to speech, and directing us away from the functions of
economics and politics. What identity politics have effectively served
to create is an impotent language of multiculturalism that privileges
victimhood and orients the disenfranchised toward superficial battles
rather than towards direct action, subversion, and
violence.]{.underline} Dean (2009) explains, 95 [The position of victim
(rather than victor) grows out of a prominent strain of contemporary
American politics, namely, the rights discourse associated with
movements for civil rights, women's rights, and the rights of sexual
minorities]{.underline}.7 Although often linked to left political
correctness, speaking as a victim is at odds with the long history of
the labor movement as well as with the politics of the new left. One
need but recall a whole series of claims to power: 'Black power,'
'Sisterhood is powerful,' 'We're here; we're queer; get used to it,'
'Power to the people.' Reducing political speech to testimony to the
suffering of victims inverts these claims to power and subverts the
movements' activist spirit, (p. 5) The discourse of victimhood does not
produce institutional change. It produces social milieus. [Today's
identity politics are vacuous. They have been reduced by neoliberal
technologies to a microcosm of what they once were. Today's "social
justice warriors" are self-aggrandizing, going through the motions, and
their digital protests are in direct symmetry with the emptiness of
academic social critique.]{.underline} Frances Lee's widely circulated
(2017) blog article, "Kin Aesthetics: Excommunicate Me From the Church
of Social Justice" mirrors LaTour's (2004) critique of cultural studies,
evidencing that [identity politics movements today have become a
divisive lifestyle which uncritically promote elitist and superficial
language/analysis and attachment to "sacred texts" that fail to
meaningfully challenge capitalist logics.]{.underline} When once Stokely
Carmichael (1967) called for direct action and violence, citing the ways
that [civil rights movements become coopted, today #BlackLivesMatter is
a savvy political brand aimed at shaping the modem platform of the
Democratic Party, unconcerned with neoliberal imperialism]{.underline}
(Dixon, 2015). When transgender women once threw bricks at the Stonewall
Inn and physically defended themselves against police bmtality, today
the LGBT+ movement musters its collective force to fail movies that 96
don't adequately address the perception of their history (Smith, 2015).
[Identity politics have become problematic, as social justice warriors
might say. Neoliberal technologies are particularly good at orienting us
towards digital milieus. Identity politics have become hashtags and
Facebook arguments. They have become circulation; more information
capital lost in the flow on neoliberal networks.]{.underline} Jodi Dean
(2009) explains her notion of circulation, Any particular contribution
remains secondary to the fact of circulation. The value of any
particular contribution is likewise inversely proportionate to the
openness, inclusiveness, or extent of a circulating data stream: the
more opinions or comments that are out there, the less of an impact any
given one might make (and the more shocking, spectacular, and new a
contribution must be in order to register or have an impact). In sum,
communication functions symptomatically to produce its own negation, (p.
26) [Today, issues of social justice and culture are taken up in endless
ways on the internet by ever fracturing groups of individuals,
constantly reimagining their space, positionality, and
identity.]{.underline} Social media, blogs, group pages, and more direct
lines of communication swell with hashtags, petitions, and arguments
lined with a language of social justice ripe with lingo and abbreviation
specific to the causes of internet activists. [They remain detached from
means of power and economics, and are instead easily swept into the
currents of network, producing ever more information capital for the
system they wish to challenge.]{.underline} The internet is a cozy and
comfortable place for the disenfranchised to dump their proclivities for
change. The Invisible Committee (2007) writes of activists organizations
as "empty structures, which, in spite of their grand origins, can never
be filled. In all their affairs, at every level, these organizations are
concerned above all with their own survival as organizations, and 97
little else," but "Far more dreadful are social milieus, with their
supple texture, their gossip, and their informal hierarchies. Flee all
milieus. Each and every milieu is oriented towards the neutralization of
some truth" (p. 100). Digital milieus are no different: they form a
language, a culture, sublimate a revolutionary message, and finally,
punish and attack anyone who fails to perform their message the way they
have deemed to be fashionable. These milieus and fractioned identity
politics groups fail to convert any particulars into a universal cause
or coherent Left capable of challenging neoliberal power. They are
divisive and often simply serve as a vehicle to dump one's rightful
fears and anger about social injustices, producing a hard sardony, as
their digital contributions are appropriated and exchanged as
information capital. Dean (2009) writes, Contestations today rarely
employ common terms, points of reference, or demarcated frontiers. In
our highly mediated communications environments we confront instead a
multiplication of resistances and assertions so extensive as to hinder
the formation of strong counterhegemonies[. The proliferation,
distribution, acceleration, and intensification of communicative access
and opportunity result in a deadlocked democracy incapable of serving as
a form for political change]{.underline}. I refer to this democracy that
talks without responding as communicative capitalism, (p. 22) The
digital milieus of identity politics cannot serve us. They fracture,
rather than connect, and convert useful resentment against the system
into circulation. They squander revolutionary potential. Digital milieus
are the internet equivalent of activist organizations and thus
exacerbate the already existent problems of management, exclusivity, and
production, through the reach, scope, and capture of neoliberal
technologies. 98 Identity politics and digital milieus converge with
neoliberal technologies to orient us to nonviolence, toward issues of
culture rather than institutional awareness, and toward matters of the
interpersonal, because this is what is achievable via the method of
digital milieus and the internet, such as through petitions, social
media, etc. Identity politics are particularly attuned and skilled in
making it known that a particularly movie might be racist or even that
an act of police brutality has occurred, but not in highlighting or
addressing the ways in which systems function. Digital milieus, in
short, orient us to matters of subjective, rather than objective
violence. Slavoj Zizek (2008) explains the difference, as The catch is
that subjective and objective violence cannot be perceived from the same
standpoint: subjective violence is experienced as such against the
background of a non-violent zero level. It is seen as a perturbation of
the 'normal,' peaceful state of things. However, objective violence is
precisely the violence inherent to this 'normal' state of things.
[Objective violence is invisible since it sustains the very zero-level
standard against which we perceive something as subjectively violent.
Systemic violence is thus something like the notorious 'dark matter' of
physics, the counterpart to an all-too-visible subjective violence. It
may be invisible, but it has to be taken into account if one is to make
sense of what otherwise seem to be 'irrational' explosions of subjective
violence,]{.underline} (p. 2) Digital identity politics address
egregious shows of force that emerge and appear on top of the regular
functions of economics, politics, and our daily routines, which
disappear in mundanity. [We can stop a bill from passing that would
victimize transgender women, or get a cop put on trial for killing an
unarmed black man, but identity politics cannot address the imperial and
domestic violence of capitalism; it cannot impede the rhythm of empire.
Politics are thus reduced to subjectivized dilemma, and often reduced
further to the smallest microcosm of interpersonal 99 interaction since
internet technologies allow even the most ordinary civilian to hold a
lens at all places and times in the public sphere. Identity politics
becomes lost in the exchange of all things that the neoliberal shift
from capital as wage relation to social relation produced. Digital
milieus cannot challenge the flows of information and capital in network
because it is contributing to them through the conversion of their
revolutionary anger to circulation.]{.underline} However, I would like
to consider what form resistance might take to disturb and counteract
the flows of empire. In the following section I will examine what kind
of force might make way against the objective violence and processes of
desubjectivation through which neoliberalism sustains itself. I will
attempt to offer solutions.

### Cap Impact

#### **Sustained global capitalism ensures nuclear escalation, magnifies local conflicts, and intensifies inequalities**

**Hrubec and Uhde 18-** The research of guest editors of this thematic
issue was made in the framework of the research programme "Global
Conflicts and Local Interactions", Strategy AV21, The Czech Academy of
Sciences.

The contemporary changes make global conflicts and local interactions
increasingly interconnected. The local problem can spread rapidly
globally, and global problems can interfere in many local communities.
Diverse global conflicts have a strong influence on local social
dynamics; at the same time, local processes, especially in hegemonic
geopolitical macro-regions, shape the global political and economic
order[. Today's problems have crystallized as a result of various
technological, economic, political, social, cultural and other global
interactions over the long history of human civilization]{.underline}
which have not been sufficiently processed and integrated into the
systemic framework of local, regional and national structures and the
global civilizational system, nor into theoretical research analyses.
While colonial history lies deep in the roots of many contemporary
problems, today [**the main power behind the perpetuation of systemic
and structural causes of inequalities and injustice is global
capitalism, with the related processes of the exploitation and
marginalization of various world macro-regions and hegemonic war
conflicts**. Critical research into global conflicts and local
interactions brings to the fore mutual relations between diverse issues
such as military escalation, wars, transnational migration, poverty,
exploitation, displacement and social expulsion, transnational
corporations, gender and racial inequalities, etc., and opens up
horizons for the normative issues of struggling for global justice and
peace, reshaping democracy and citizenship in a post-national
constellation and new economic paradigms compatible with civilizational
and ecological developments]{.underline}. [The challenge faced by social
research into global conflicts is that analyses need to be directed not
only at security studies, but also and principally at the complex
sources and causes of wars and other contemporary problems, mainly in
the form of the subtle economic, political, and cultural practices of
global capitalism which lie behind armed conflicts]{.underline}. These
analyses are also the first step towards resolving conflicts. In other
words, we can say that analyses of "hard power" should be supplemented
and redefined by analyses focused on "soft power", that is, on the
economic, political and other forces which condition the first kind of
force. The subject of global conflicts in relation to their local
interactions has not been researched systematically much yet, although
global conflicts, on the one hand, and various related local economic,
political, and cultural processes, on the other, have received separate
attention from numerous researchers. It is important to start with the
premise that global conflicts and their local interactions constitute
fundamental challenges for social research and also future possibilities
of positive social interactions. This premise transforms the perspective
from which individual issues and territorial analyses are approached.
Existing studies have shown that, while territorial integration
processes have lasted on our planet for millennia, and globalizing
processes have continued since the expansion of Europeans into the
Americas 500 years ago, a majority of authors associate the notion of
global interactions primarily with accelerated globalization since the
end of the 1980s. Challenges faced by social research into global
interactions place new demands on analyses of conflictual
transnationalization in late modern societies and on cosmopolitan claims
in a transdisciplinary approach (Fine, 2007; Jaggar, 2014; Beck, 2016).
**[A precondition for these analyses is consideration of the current
crisis tendencies of global capitalism which could prove deeper in the
long run than the structural crisis of 2008]{.underline}** (Robinson,
2014). [**The deeper characteristics of these crisis tendencies indicate
trends which may lead not only to structural crisis, but also to a
crisis of the whole system. The past structural crises of the world
system seriously polarized relations between social groups and classes,
damaged the economic basis, and weakened or delegitimized state
authority, with consequences for the restructuring of the capitalist
system**. Such restructuring made possible the revitalization of the
collapsed economy, politics, and society within the system. The main
cause of the current crisis is over-accumulation because global
production and trade heavily increased accumulation in the past few
decades]{.underline}. **[Current problematic trends are defined by
environmental limits, global social and economic inequalities, social
control and militarized tendencies, the territorial limits to the
expansion of the contemporary order, the population creating surplus
labor, and political contradictions between the nation states and
transnational arrangements in the era of global
capitalism]{.underline}** (Harris, 2016; Sklair, 2016). The thematic
symposium in this issue follows research and its international
cooperation within a new transdisciplinary research programme "Global
Conflicts and Local Interactions" at the Czech Academy of Sciences in
Prague. The research team focuses not only on armed conflicts, but also
on economic, political, social, and cultural conflicts and their local
interlinks with regard to particularism and universalism and also with
regard to interactions between global, macro-regional, national and
local orders. It contributes to critical analyses of the contemporary
society and the complex thematic issue of glocal interactions
(Fasenfest, 2010; Hrubec, 2012). Nevertheless, this special thematic
symposium cannot analyze all the relevant topics within the thematic
area of global conflicts and local interactions. It addresses three
important aspects in particular: first**[, militarized escalation
leading to the global police state and threat of nuclear war; second,
the complex intertwinement of transnational societal challenges anchored
in contradictions of the current global system; third, problematic
issues and the positive potential of civil society]{.underline}** in
Western countries and in sub-Saharan Africa. Militarized Escalation,
Transnationalization, and Civil Developments First, **[militarized
escalation by means of current global repressive tendencies is linked to
the transformation of the police and war]{.underline}**. While the
global order as a whole develops step by step in specific local and
national conditions, at the same time the militarization of local and
national places is Hrubec and Uhde 3 closely interlinked to
macro-regional involvement in the webs of transnational and global war
conflicts (Robinson, 2018). **[A locally created problem in the main
global superpower, the USA, can easily spread globally]{.underline}**.
[Even if the USA is declining power, its leading economic and political
groups, in collaboration with other transnational capital groups, have
still played a leading role in the domination of the world via
militarily channels on the global level]{.underline}. [The
militarization of the economy and society]{.underline} is rooted
particularly in the events of 11 September 2001, and [has led to global
interactions that connect the military and security complex with
industrial and political trends in a specific dangerous way]{.underline}
(Hristov, 2014; Paley, 2014). **[These repressive tendencies have led to
the establishment of a global police state.]{.underline}** **[Because of
the new political and economic trends in the USA and their intense
conflictual integration within global capitalism, there are high risks
of military escalation, with dangerous lethal consequences for
societies]{.underline}** (Hrubec, 2016). [The current impulses for the
nuclear threat and related problems are formulated in new strategic
documents of the US administration,]{.underline} particularly in the
National Security Strategy and the Nuclear Posture Review. [Political
statements]{.underline} based on these and other documents open up the
possibility of the real use of nuclear weapons in a limited nuclear war.
Highly advanced electronic systems, containing transnational
communication with big data, developed high-precise weapon systems and
other tools, also allow for the application of nuclear weapons on a very
specific territorial scale. **[On the basis of new technologies,
political and economic actors have revitalized the possibility of
nuclear war,]{.underline}** and the establishment of Donald Trump in the
White House has opened a real threat of "thinking the unthinkable", i.e.
a real nuclear conflict. **[Even if the hypothesis for nuclear war
cannot be proven before the war breaks out, the highly dangerous
military, economic, and political tendencies potentially leading to this
kind of war are sufficient reason to pay attention to this serious
problem]{.underline}**. [In the long history of human civilization,
people have always misused the most developed technological innovations
in wars.]{.underline} There is a serious probability that we are not at
the end of history, when the people would stop doing that. [This is why
it is important to help to contain this kind of threat by analyzing
it]{.underline} (Lodgaard, 2010). Second, the thematic area of global
conflicts and local interactions places a spotlight on the
transnationalization of social and other processes and relations. While
these intertwined aspects of the contradictions of global capitalism are
often examined separately, their analyses require research into complex
interconnections and the common causes of local and global problems,
which is also a necessary first step in articulating potential remedies
and normative requirements for global justice. The analytical lens of
global interactions also sheds light on the changing role of the nation
state, and problematizes the commonly accepted premise equating society
with the political unit of a nation state. The gap between the global
interconnectedness of social processes, on the one hand, and efforts to
address arising social conflicts at the level of nation states and
internationally organized political institutions, on the other hand, is
prevalent not only in real politics, but also in the current social
sciences (Beck, 2016). Asking fundamental contemporary questions thus
calls for a different methodological approach, which is linked to
transnational inquiry. The main focuses are on the transnational
intertwinement of social and environmental contradictions that are
manifested in various conjunctions in global crises, risks, and
conflicts, and on transnational migration, which is an exemplary case of
interdependent problems, be they economic, social, political, cultural,
or environmental. **[The profit-oriented global system creates social
and environmental risks that are unequally distributed. Nevertheless,
they pose a challenge for everybody on the planet]{.underline}**. [While
from a short-term perspective the transnational ruling groups benefit
from the planetary plundering of natural resources, labor precarisation,
exploitation and expulsion, and sharpening social and economic
inequalities, **their adaptation to these social conflicts and crises
induces the further multiplication and cumulation of destructive
consequences to a point that**]{.underline}) **[poses a threat to the
current system and even to the sustainability of human life on the
planet]{.underline}** (Sassen, 2014). **[These are the fundamental
limits of the current system]{.underline}**

We all share in vulnerability argues Butler, even on this global
geopolitical scale and it's rooted in a 'social vulnerability.'
[**Against Butler's idea of a shared 'social vulnerability',** this
chapter argues **human vulnerability** in its various guises and
comparable quantifications **is not of the same quality as black
vulnerability**.]{.underline} Black vulnerability is of a different kind
then even the extreme vulnerability Butler identifies as imposed by the
war on terror. **[Black vulnerability has an abject quality because of
its non-relationality that expels the experience of black people from
the realm of the human by means of an objectifying
violence.]{.underline} ¶** [The extralegal policies issued by the United
States state department seemingly defy all modern legal precedence
domestically and internationally, culminating in the practice of
indefinite detention at Guantanamo Bay---which still holds thirty-nine
people as of January 2022.]{.underline} And yet, these conditions still
discursively refer to a human subject insomuch as these persons retain
some form of cultural historical integrity and a political ontology that
can identify and punish transgressions of its normative orders, even if
these transgressions are generally seen as acceptable by a broader human
coalition. [Undeniably a shared vulnerability of the human gets
manipulated and contorted to produce an intensification of vulnerability
for the brown, deceitful, 'terrorist', both abroad and in the United
States.]{.underline} The profound degradation of the Middle Eastern
person, however, is not the same as the abject black object and this
distinction must be considered beyond the discourses of colorblindness,
protest size, or even the unfathomable unconstitutional practices of the
US government toward an entire religion and region post 9/11.¶ "This
chapter began by [recounting black experience at the beginning of the
twenty-first century not merely because it describes a black
vulnerability that overlaps temporally with the hostility toward Middle
Easterners, which is the signature of the never-ending war on terror
that framed Butler's reflections of vulnerability]{.underline}. Indeed,
these two historical examples are worthy of comparison for their
temporal overlap and conceptual distinction, but also a look at the
beginning of the twenty-first century and the right 'now' for black
people also calls attention to an eerie repetition of the same, whereby
the spectacular horror of violence that is attached to the names
Trayvon, Tamir; Taylor, Floyd, seem all too familiar and even now more
than ever seem almost necessary for the functioning of the political
order of America, even if it is not clear why. [In describing the
peculiarity of black (political) vulnerability this chapter will also
need to address what appears to be this compulsion of antiblack violence
and the spectacle that obscures it.]{.underline} Butler's reimagination
of subjectivity through vulnerability is an attempt to reform the
ethico-political presumptions that encourage individualism, nationalism,
and dichotomous self-constructions, suggesting American aggression and
Middle Eastern resentment are notes in the same chord. [The concept of
**vulnerability supposedly can unveil** the harmony of **humanity** even
when its violent hypocrisies are loudest. Yet **the hostility toward
blacks and their vulnerability resonates in a different key**; the
interminable 'war on terror' is different from the positionality of the
slave that must be reaffirmed regardless of, and illegible to, more
prominent narratives in American political discourse and political
economy.]{.underline}¶ [Through **the lens of afropessimism,** Frank
Wilderson III and Jared Sexton---along with others---**allow us to
conceptualize the uniqueness of black vulnerability**, or rather its
illegibility and objectifying nature, over and **against the spectrum of
shared political vulnerability described by Butler and
others**.]{.underline} The key to understanding black vulnerability and
[its extraordinary character is a notion of social
death]{.underline}---which will be recategorized as political death in
the next chapter---[that positions black people not merely at the edge
but on the outside and antagonistic to a political community that is
structured by antiblack white supremacy]{.underline}. Wilderson provides
the most comprehensive conception of black social death working
primarily from, with modification, Orlando Patterson's definition in the
seminal work Slavery and Social Death, in addition to inspiration from
Frantz Fanon, Saidiya Hartman, and Hortense Spillers. Through social
death, [black people occupy a positionality---not a subjective
identity---that refuses legibility as human. This is accomplished under
the parameters of dishonor, natal alienation, and gratuitous
violence.]{.underline} [The black positionality is unique in its'
non-relation to all other positionalities inasmuch as its degradation is
an absolute abjection, in other words modern political ontology denies
all relationality to black people. It is not contingently maintained
through possible transgressions, but structurally constitutive through
negation in the formation of proper political subjectivity, from the
most valued to the least valued political subjects.]{.underline} Social
death as abjection is necessary to maintain the world of the human.
Jared Sexton offers the helpful description of a general economy to
conceptualize the excess and need for repetition as a non-rational
affective investment in the abjection of black people. [From these
perspectives emerges a concept of **black vulnerability** that **goes
beyond Butler's homogenized conceptualization of a collective
ontological vulnerability.** Through **a loss of what was never there**,
a loss that is **gratuitously reified through repetition, we can better
understand what is specific to antiblack violence.**]{.underline} David
Marriott employs the term abjection to signify a loss that was never
present (Marriott 2007, 123).¶ Gratuity compliments abjection, as it
explains the excessive repetition of antiblack violence, since there are
no legible norms to be transgressed in a loss that was never present and
thus no ultimate rationality or foundation to rest on except bare
assertion. As Wilderson describes in the first chapter of Red, White,
and Black: ["This (**gratuitous ) violence** which turns a body into
flesh, ripped apart literally and imaginatively, **destroys the
possibility of ontology because it positions the Black** **in an
infinite and indeterminately horrifying open vulnerability**, an object
made available (which is to say **fungible) for any
subject**.]{.underline} (Wilderson III 2010, 38; my emphasis) [In
describing black vulnerability as 'infinite', 'indeterminate', and
'horrifyingly open', Wilderson provides a conceptual framing and
analytic undoing that demands rethinking who may belong to the spectrum
of human vulnerability and what does not.]{.underline} This chapter next
turns to an explication of the excessive 'extra-ordinary' nature of the
illegible, fungible, accumulative, and abject object of blackness that
characterizes black vulnerability."¶ II. The General Economy of White
Supremacy and Extra-ordinary Black Vulnerability [**Following** in the
spirit of **Butler's innovative refguring of subjectivity via
vulnerability**, Catriona Mackenzie, Wendy Rogers, and Susan
Dodds,]{.underline} [**in the introduction to** their 2014 reader
**titled Vulnerability: New Essays in Ethics and Feminist Philosophy,**
also **call for the displacement of the traditional role of rationality
for describing the essence of humanity, proclaiming "Human life is
conditioned by vulnerability"**]{.underline} (Mackenzie et al. 2014, 1).
While vulnerability may have universal applicability for human life,
they argue it does not come in one standard universal form. [They make a
welcomed contribution to Butler's intervention by breaking down
vulnerability into a helpful taxonomy that situates the different ways
it manifests itself through our materiality as needy bodies, through the
social and affective nature of our being open to others through grief,
humiliation, or through our socio-political nature as open to
exploitation and oppression]{.underline}. Also, vulnerability can emerge
from a different variety of sources, that is, inherent, situational, or
pathogenic, as well as exist in different states, that is, dispositional
or occurrent.¶ [These distinctions are constructive and yet limited when
it comes to black people. Under this rubric, the experience of black
vulnerability would fall under an occurrent state, meaning that it is
not a matter of dispositional possibility of becoming vulnerable, for
example, some physical disabilities, but rather black vulnerability is
manifest constantly.]{.underline} Furthermore, its source would be
pathogenic entailing a systematic oppression that is not simply
inherited by means of being human or strictly situational. Makenzie,
Rogers, and Dodds explain, **["a key feature of pathogenic vulnerability
is the way that it undermines autonomy or exacerbates the sense of
powerlessness engendered by vulnerability in general"]{.underline}**
(Mackenzie et al. 2014, 9). At first glance their taxonomy appears more
than sufficient to account for black vulnerability. Black vulnerability
would be one among many forms of occurrent and pathogenic conditions
that plague a plethora of identities that fall short of the generally
accepted zero-sum position of white cisgender heterosexual ablebodied
bourgeois men. However, there is a marked difference for the experience
of black people: their autonomy and 'sense of power', at least as
traditional subjects, is not undermined but illegible because of an
original lack of political ontological stature. Singularly, [the
pathology that characterize black vulnerability is abjection, whereby
**black people are banished from the metrics of humanity that would
render their suffering, and therefore their vulnerability,** irrational,
that **is beyond sublation, and non-relational**]{.underline}.¶ [Perhaps
**the most insidious component of black vulnerability** from a
philosophical perspective **follows from the fact that antiblackness
elides any appeal to an ultimate justification or rationality**. When
confronted with the machinations of antiblackness in everyday life, for
example, with hate crimes, police brutality, disproportionate wages, and
so on, these manifestations at first appear as if they can make sense in
some larger context or rationale.]{.underline} [As if there is some
identifiable reason why black people deserve repercussion]{.underline},
as if they had transgressed some cultural normative arrangement or even
economic preserving ideology. These [racist 'events' appear in a
taxonomy of violence that point toward antiblackness, but what if the
underlying justification beyond their expression from a restricted
perspective escapes any ultimate justification or rationality beyond the
bare assertion of black abjection? **We may say that Michael Brown would
be alive if he had not stolen from that convenient store (if indeed that
was the case),**]{.underline} if he were not poor (although this too of
course plays a role), if he had not charged like 'the Hulk', if he were
not jay walking[, **but** those ancillary reasons only obscure the
reality that **his violation ultimately needs no reason**. **It was
not** simply a 'sense of **powerlessness' or lack of autonomy, but
instead abject inhumanness,** his non-relationality, that brought him to
the alter for sacrifice in the name of white supremacy.]{.underline}
[**His blackness made him vulnerable beyond belief**---or, to be more
specific, only on the grounds of belief---because it was his blackness
that brought Darren Wilson to that neighborhood,]{.underline} as with
many other officers, and it was his blackness that turned the
18-year-old into the Hulk, it was blackness that turned 12-year-old
Tamir Rice into an armed and dangerous adult, it was blackness that
turned Rodney King's shielding forearms into aggressive pursuit and
falling pants into sexual assault.¶ Jared Sexton articulates the
structure of a 'libidinal economy of white supremacy' using the
insightful heuristic of the general economy. [The libidinal economy
refers to the affective and subconscious desires and investments that
informs one's self-identifications. For 'white supremacy' these are the
arrangement and distribution of desires and affects, positive or
negative, that support the formation of any identity over against
blackness.]{.underline} Now, a general economy challenges the logic of
traditional economic models that are considered essentially rationalized
laws of exchange, since its grounding principle is instead exuberant
expenditure, without any ultimate reason. Sexton describes white
supremacy as a general economy in the 2003 essay co-authored with Steve
Martinot titled "The Avant-Garde of White Supremacy," but he explores
the concept with greater depth and by name in his 2008 book Amalgamation
Schemes: Antiblackness and the Critique of Multiracialism. While in the
former essay he uses the term 'hyper economy', in the latter he uses the
term general economy explicitly, citing Arkady Plotnitski's
Reconfgurations as his source. For this discussion, however, it is worth
considering the more familiar, and the inspiration of Plotniski's
analysis in his book, twentieth-century French theorist and eroticist
Georges Bataille.

#### The [weaponization]{.underline} of Black vulnerability for the political agendas of [junior partners]{.underline} sustains a [bottomless well]{.underline} of antiblack violence

Mukasa **Mubirumusoke** 20**22** \[Assistant Professor in the

Life" https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-95255-6\]//sheima

This is not to imply that there is not class difference among black
people. The black people listed at the beginning of the chapter as
so-called beacons of progress do indeed live a much different life than
the poor and working-class victims of violence that were named soon
after (although a few of the former did not always live with money and
may not continue in the future. There are real consequences for these
class distinctions; for example, Skip Gates ultimately had a beer summit
with the first black president after his confrontation with a police
officer; meanwhile, Brionna Taylor did not even get a knock at the door
before her demise. These different class experiences cannot be conflated
and the black poor and working classes experience life differently, but
that experience does attend to the ontological. The few black Americans
that owned slaves, for instance, were not whitened; they had more money.
Nevertheless, they were always vulnerable in a way that was not the same
as even the poorest white people who may indeed perish from the
consequences of their poverty. The qualitative distinction between white
and black exceeds calculations and again only an appeal to the general
economy of white supremacy can make sense of this distinction. [The
vulnerability of any proletariat can be overcome through hard work (some
harder than others), but **black vulnerability at the ontological
level**---which **includes sudden death for no reason at all except the
fact that one is black**---cannot be ultimately mitigated by labor
regardless of the neighborhood.]{.underline} Therefore, while it may not
be the literal case that black people can be purchased as chattel slaves
in 2020 (although the conditions in Libya may challenge even this
contention), [**the nonrelation of blackness** as vulnerable to anyone
was set by a diremption between black and non-black centuries ago and
this antagonism **is constituted by the extra-ordinary, that is,
illegible, accumulative, fungible, abject, objectifcation, and the open
vulnerability** that follows from it.]{.underline} From a materialist
perspective, it is often argued that racism and sexism are used to
obscure true class relations and create inessential hierarchies and
intraclass confict. A Marxist or class critique may indeed allow one to
see the exploitation at work behind the hypnotic light of our computer
screens, but will that unmask the 'ugliness' of the affective economy
and larger ethical dilemma of white supremacy? Let's hear Wilderson
explain in his own words: [**Anti-black violence is vital to the psychic
well-being of White (and nonBlack) people everywhere.**]{.underline}
Violence against black people provides a sanctuary for White people, a
guaranteed matrix of safety, security, and respite---respite from the
otherwise unbearable hydraulics of their own family lives, and from the
unbearable hydraulics of an ugly world that they have created and which
they know, in the collective unconscious, to be ugly, though they can't
bring themselves to admit it is beyond redemption. (Wilderson III 2015,
148) [Antiblack violence is vital in maintaining the hierarchy of the
antiblack world, but as the parenthetical term intimates, the human also
extends to those non-blacks, which Wilderson identifes as the 'junior
members' of white civil society (Wilderson III 2007, 26) and who may
also attend to the bottomless well of anti-blackness for their own
constitution.]{.underline} These junior members are the familiar
marginal political groupings, whether they be other people of color,
other categories of identity regarding gender, sexual orientation, or
even the  previously discussed political economic positions, such as the
worker. It is hard not to recognize that this sort of malleability in
terms of self-fortifcation is once again an attribute of the excessive
economy of white supremacy as the gift that keeps on giving. [In
contemporary times we see the proliferation of identities that make
claim to their marginal status over against the status quo and their
legibility is not just symbolic differentiation.]{.underline} This may
indeed mark their legibility as a given 'exceptional' categorical
possibility, but **[the vitality of their stature is enriched or
stabilized by comparing and distinguishing from
blackness]{.underline}**. [All these junior members participate in the
fortification of white civil society, only marginally, but still by way
of anti-blackness. This is indeed a polemical contention, but it need
not be so reductively interpreted as a ranking. Rather, the constitutive
primacy of antiblackness serves as a tracing of the conceptual
landscape, whereby it becomes clear where the ever so replenishing life
force of what we recognize as the human or civil society
springs from]{.underline}. Wilderson provides a number of examples of
how such parasitic anti-blackness arises in everyday life from junior
members. For instance, in the previously cited "Prison Slave" essay he
cites the sort of anti-black subjection that Assata Shakur describes in
her biography via a white woman in the abolitionist movement,
concluding, "The verisimilitude between Assata's well known police
encounters and her experience in civil society's most nurturing nook,
the radical coalition, raises disturbing questions about political
desire, black positionality, and hegemony as a mode of struggle"
(Wilderson III 2007, 24). [One question may be: what are the limits of
non-black prison abolitionists when it comes to sacrificing for the
greater good? Carceral punishment for even the most heinous crimes
appears to be one thing that must go with the abolition movement, but
even then, **antiblackness cannot help itself from flourishing even in
the most radical places.**]{.underline} Also, in another example of the
ever-expanding list of who finds respite in antiblackness, one may turn
back to the essay "Afro-Pessimism and the End of Redemption," where
Wilderson recalls a conversation with a Palestinian friend whose cousin
had died constructing a bomb. The friend then confded, in a moment of
unfiltered grief, that the humiliation of the full body searches
conducted by Israeli soldiers was worse when it was an Ethiopian Jew.
Wilderson goes on to explain: I was faced with the realization that, in
the collective unconscious, the Palestinian insurgent has more in common
with Israeli state and civil society than s/he does with Black people.
[**What they share is a largely unconscious consensus that Blackness is
a locus of abjection to be instrumentalized on a whim. At one moment
Blackness is a disfigured and disfiguring phobic phenomenon; at another
moment Blackness is a sentient implement to be joyously deployed for
reasons and agendas that have little to do with Black liberation**
...]{.underline} My friend's and his country's women's and men's
negrophobogensis, is the bedrock, the concrete slabs upon which any
edifice of human articulation (whether love or war) is built. (Wilderson
III 2016) Antiblackness necessarily shades even the 'micro-aggressions'
in the examples of Assata and Wilderson's friend above. The white prison
abolitionist and the Palestinian insurgent can sense the absolute
abjection of blackness, and they gesture toward it to give themselves a
glimpse at their own humanity, however much degraded by the violence
they are subjected to via contingent violation as opposed to the
gratuitous violence that black people may meet at a whim. Black
vulnerability is of the same quality as theirs. [While black people and
the junior members share the category of occurrent, it is not pathogenic
in the way of undermining autonomy or exacerbating any sense of
powerlessness through particular actions that circumscribe their
subjection. Instead, **it is a vulnerability that is abject**, that is
discursively illegible or without origin, objectifying, psychically
replenishing, and **fortified by the dominant and marginal constituents
of civil society, gratuitously,** that is, without reason or dialectical
reconciliation. **Black vulnerability marks the parameters of human or
subjective capacity** through a broad coalition of policing the contours
of the human and hardly human in a collective unconscious of
antiblackness.]{.underline}

### Link -- Hegemonic Masculinity 

#### Their invocation of the [feminine/masculine dichotomy]{.underline} confines black women into the archive of gender founded upon [humanist categories]{.underline} that renders the [black gender]{.underline} silent

Mukasa **Mubirumusoke** 20**22** \[Assistant Professor in the

When regarding the functioning of the spectacular, it also cannot go
unmentioned that black cisgender men have garnered the most attention
and although the considerations here will avoid focusing on any event in
too much detail, it should be noted this group is not exclusively
subject to such violence. [Patrice D. Douglass gives a very nuanced
reading of gender and afropessimism as it follows in the wake of
Spillers' invocation of (un)gendering and the fashion in which
**femininity and masculinity are misnamed and misrecognized under white
supremacy.**]{.underline} Douglass explains: Juxtaposing the
hyper-visibility of the death of Black men against the invisibility and
silencing of the death of Black women opens a litany of trap doors.
[Placing the lens on how Black women die is not to demand that visual
images of their deaths are repeated on social media networks and the
nightly news at the behest of the pleasure of viewing Black suffering.
In fact, the issue of Black gender is more complex than the
dichotomization of death. Furthermore, to bifurcate Black gender, Black
women up against Black men, achieves nothing more than reifying gender
stratifcations that historically and experientially have never been made
available to Black people. By shifting perspective, we might ask, how
Black feminist politics account for the dead and dying inclusive of all
genders?]{.underline} (Douglass 2018, 108) ¶ [**This concluding call**,
asked of and inspired by black feminism, thus **demands**, not the
dismissal of gendered violence, but **rethinking** the juxtaposition and
ossifcation of such **identities that are never afforded through proper
terms of gender, since they are only created through a violence to
separate these black identities from the political ontology of the
human.**]{.underline} [Black (un)gendering thus exposes with greater
depth the ways in which **black vulnerability exceeds all principles and
categories of the human.**]{.underline} To refer to Douglass one more
time at length she elaborates: ¶ [**The archive of gender is
structurally anti-black. Its assumptive logic, whether explicit in its
presentation or not, maintains that all women have the same gender.**
This orientation of thought does more than render Black gender invisible
or silent. It makes it conceptually impossible to think of gender
violence as orienting more than the realm of gender.]{.underline} Rather
than engaging a politic fixated on what binds women together in life,
[**I want to draw focus to what separates Black women in death. What
creates the conditions of (im)possibility for Black women to
die?**]{.underline} (Douglass 2018, 115)¶ [Humans die; meanwhile,
**black women are hailed into existence by a violence that only permits
their perishing**. This reality needs to be kept in mind when we are
thinking of the phenomenon of police violence.]{.underline} Violence
against black women should not be ignored, but an increased media
presence does not bring about human recognition; their absence is part
and parcel of an anti-black violence that imposes gender differently,
though for a similar end, that is, social (and real) death. [Wilderson
falls in line with much of what Douglass explicates and suggests that
the media focus on the carceral violence received by black men only
serves the purpose of reifying spectacular violence and offering a false
sense of agency through assuming the human categories of
gender.]{.underline} [**Gender for black people is not essential**, it
is a 'borrowed institutionality" instrumentalized in strategic ways. In
the end, the actions of police brutality, inclusive of all genders, are
not simply spontaneous or isolated acts of individual anger; they serve
the ends of white civil society inasmuch as its constituents, while
recognizing a certain horror in police brutality, feel safe from the
fears and dread of its reality in the space where it belongs, namely in
the black community.]{.underline} Moreover, there is also pleasure
derived in the negrophilic dalliance of a weekend warrior protestor
where their confrontation with police actually can be dignifying. These
spectacular images show to many that the police are doing their job,
which explains the ex post facto justifcations of these black people as
criminals even though the criminal records that these victims might
possess actually points to the criminalization of their livelihood, that
is, the banality of white supremacy. Again, the spectacles obscure all
of this and serve to provide a "vital cultural labor" (Sexton and
Martinot 2003, 176) Or as Sexton and Martinot state explicitly:¶ White
supremacy is not reconstructed simply for its own sake but for the sake
of the social paranoia, the ethic of impunity, and the violent
spectacles of racialization that it calls the "maintenance of order,"
all of which constitute its essential dimensions. The cold, gray
institutions of this society -- courts, schools, prisons, police, army,
law, religion, the two-party system -- become the arenas of this
brutality, its excess and spectacle, which they then normalize
throughout the social field. (Sexton and Martinot 2003, 180)

### Link -- Fem / Intersectionality

#### Intersectional feminist logic [delegitimates]{.underline} the effect of [ontological blackness]{.underline} as opposed to "epistemological masculinity." Vulnerability is thus [weaponized]{.underline} towards the creation of black-as-vessel, existent only for its cultural production Sirma Bilge 20 \[Department of Sociology, The fungibility of intersectionality: an Afropessimist reading, <https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2020.1740289>, March 23 2020, Accessed 7/5/22, <https://doi-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/10.1080/01419870.2020.1740289>, -ekh-\]

Given the centrality of the concept of fungibility in my argument and
its close ties to Afropessimism, it is worth starting by a succinct
exposé of the latter's central tenets. First things first,
[Afropessimism under consideration here is the US-version of
Afropessimism, which was developed several decades after its original
elaboration in Africa]{.underline} (with a different meaning) [and
largely obscured this prior
conceptualization]{.underline}.[^5^](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2020.1740289)

[A foundational premise of (US-made) Afropessimism is the claim that
**[humanity was "made legible through]{.mark} the [irreconcilable
distinction between humans and blackness"]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Douglass, Terrefe, and
Wilderson [2018](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2020.1740289),
1). [**The advent of "[human]{.mark}" as category [was achieved through
the violent negation of humanity to the Black]{.mark}**, classified as
non-human.]{.underline} [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} founding
[[relationality]{.mark} in which the Black non-human is the constitutive
outside of the Human means that Blackness [eludes and exceeds the
humanist modes of thinking and world-making]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This
premise is buttressed by [the]{.mark} Afropessimist [conceptualization
of Blackness as "a **paradigmatic position, rather than an ensemble of
cultural, social, and sexual orientations**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (1),
[as [a]{.mark} "[structural position of noncommunicability in the face
of all other positions"]{.mark}]{.underline}
[(]{.mark}Wilderson [2010](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2020.1740289),
58), which is coupled with a methodological refusal -- that of any
analogizing/comparison between the regimes of violence that discipline
non-Black subalterns (dominated but human) and the one that evicts the
Black from humanity. For Afropessimists, [**[any analogizing between
Black non-being and subjugated being]{.mark}** ([whether non-Black
migrant, woman, queer, disabled) **is**]{.mark} **[misguided]{.mark}, as
fungible object is incomparable to subordinated subject, and "the
structure of the entire world's semantic field** -- regardless of
cultural and national discrepancies]{.underline} -- \[...\] [**is**
**[sutured by anti-Black solidarity]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (58). One
can hardly miss the divergence between this Afropessimist precept of
incommensurable ontological (anti)Blackness, which foregrounds one true
antagonism, [**[the one between Black non-human and non-Black human,
while it views "other repressive relations like class and
gender"]{.mark}** [as taking place "on the level of conflict -- they can
be resolved, hence they are not ontological"]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Wilderson [n.d](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2020.1740289).),
[and [the intersectional]{.mark} relational [schema]{.mark} which,
[without treating]{.mark} [differences as equivalent and
interchangeable, conceives them within a matrix of domination where
there is no superordinate antagonism]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus,
Afropessimist relational schema is hardly compatible with intersectional
relational schema. While the former builds on the premise of only one
true antagonism -- that between humans and Blacks which is the core of
ontological anti-Blackness -- relegating the others to the realm of
conflicts, because, it argues, they are not ontological, the latter
eschews the idea of a single determination (be it race, class or gender)
and focuses on theorizing their context-specific mutual constitution and
articulations.

From an Afropessimist perspective, **[[Blackness doesn't belong to the
domain of subjectivity, identity, agency and epistemology, but to that
of ontology, accumulation and fungibility, as determined by slavery and
its afterlife]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Hartman [1997](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2020.1740289)).
[What ensue are structural incommensurability and incommunicability of
Blackness vis-à-vis all other subaltern positions, "**[predicated on
modalities of accumulation and fungibility, not]{.mark}** \[Marxian\]
**exploitation and [alienation]{.mark}**"]{.underline}
(Wilderson [2010](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2020.1740289),
58) -- for slave is an object, not an exploited labourer-subject
(Patterson [1982](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2020.1740289)).

397) [of Blackness. Here, the concept of fungibility is of paramount
importance, as the predicate upon which the enslaved Black is evicted
from humanity and turned into ontologically (ac)cumulable and
exchangeable commodity]{.underline}. Hartman
([1997](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2020.1740289))
argues:

[[**the fungibility of the commodity makes the captive body an abstract
and empty vessel** **vulnerable to**]{.mark} **the [projection of
others' feelings, ideas]{.mark}, [desires, and values;]{.mark} and [as
property, the dispossessed body]{.mark} of the enslaved [is
the surrogate for the master\'s body since it]{.mark} [guarantees his
disembodied universality]{.mark} and acts [as the sign of his
power]{.mark}**.]{.underline} (21, my emphasis)

[Slavery is determinant in the Afropessimist conceptualization of
Blackness and its incommensurability with other social positions of
oppression. For Afropessimists, "the black is positioned, a priori, as
slave"]{.underline} (Douglass, Terrefe, and
Wilderson [2018](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2020.1740289),
1). [One may reasonably inquire, but what about post-emancipation?
Afropessimists answer this via **[the]{.mark}** concept "**[afterlife of
slavery]{.mark}**"
(Hartman [2007](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2020.1740289))
to argue "how the **[relationship between the slave and their status as
fungible property did not substantively change after
emancipation"]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(King [2013](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2020.1740289),
24). Hartman writes:

Slavery had established a measure of man and a ranking of life and worth
that has yet to be undone. [**[If slavery persists]{.mark}** as an issue
in the political life of black America, **[it is not because of]{.mark}
[an]{.mark} antiquarian [obsession with bygone days or]{.mark} the
burden of [a]{.mark} too-long [memory, but because black lives are still
imperiled and devalued by a racial calculus and a political arithmetic
that were entrenched centuries ago]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [This is the
afterlife of slavery -- **[skewed life chances, limited access to health
and education, premature death, incarceration, and
impoverishment]{.mark}. I, too, am the afterlife of
slavery**.]{.underline}
([2007](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2020.1740289),
6)

For Hartman, [emancipation is "both a breach with slavery and a point of
transition to what looks more like the reorganization of the plantation
system than self-possession, citizenship, or liberty of the
'freed']{.underline}"
([1997](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2020.1740289),
12). Accordingly, the plantation supersedes its historical site, so does
the fungible object status of the 'freed' Black. The lingering effects
of slavery have an important bearing on my argument about Black feminist
intersectionality's fungibility in present-day academe. If Hartman
theorizes Black non-humanity as being predicated on fungibility, i.e.
ontological status of infinitely cumulable and exchangeable commodity,
from the structural position of the enslaved, her conception of
slavery's *afterlife* authorizes the deployments of fungibility after
and beyond slavery. Such a post-emancipation use of fungibility is
obvious in Wilderson's work, when he argues:

[As an accumulated and fungible object, rather than an exploited and
alienated subject, **[Black is openly vulnerable to the whims of the
world and so is his or her cultural
'production.']{.mark}**]{.underline} What does it mean -- what are the
stakes -- when the world can whimsically transpose one's cultural
gestures, **[the [stuff of symbolic intervention, onto another worldly
good, a commodity of style?]{.mark}]{.underline}**
([2010](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2020.1740289),
56, my emphasis).

In so doing, [Wilderson not only deploys fungibility beyond the
historical site of slavery, but also expands it from Black bodies to
their artistic and intellectual productions, which are up for grabs, to
be done whatever anyone sees suitable]{.underline}. He writes:

[**The object status of Blackness means that it can be placed and
displaced with limitless frequency and across untold territories, by
whoever so chooses**. Most important, there is nothing real Black people
can do to either check or direct this process. Both jazz and hip-hop
have become known in the same way that Black bodies are known: as forces
"liberated" from time and space, belonging nowhere and to no one, simply

Black fungibility under globalized hip-hop brings compelling insights to
think through Black women's fungibility under globalized
intersectionality, which becomes intersectionality's fungibility under
globalized knowledge economy. In both cases (globalized hip-hop and
intersectionality), Black bodies and intellectual/cultural production
are in a state of infinite change and exchange. They are "open spaces of
shifting 'signification and representation' which humans use to make
meaning of their lives"
(King [2016](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2020.1740289),

75). The enslaved body's ontological status predicated on fungibility
and accumulation hence expands on Black experience and knowledge,
turning them into "an open sign that can be arranged and rearranged for
infinite kinds of use" (1025).

#### Postmodernism's reconstruction of metaphysics is [unable]{.underline} to come to terms with the [necessity]{.underline} of blackness for function which inevitablizes humanist metaphysics absent an [ontological terror]{.underline} Çalvin Warren 18 \[Assistant Professor of Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Emory University, Ontological Terror, it's a book, Duke University Press, "Introduction: The Free Black Is Nothing," redacted for racialized language, -ekh-\]

A deep abyss, or a terrifying question, engenders [the declaration
"Black Lives Matter."]{.underline} The declaration, in fact, [conceals
this question]{.underline} even as it purports to have answered it
resolutely. "Black Lives Matter," [then, carries a certain terror in its
dissemination, a terror we dare to approach with uncertainty, urgency,
and exhaustion. This question pertains to the "metaphysical
infrastructure]{.underline}," as Nahum Chandler might call it, that
conditions our world and our thinking about the world. "[**[Black Lives
Matter]{.mark}**" is an important declaration, not just because it
foregrounds the question of unbearable brutality, but]{.underline} also
[because it **[performs philosophical labor]{.mark}**]{.underline}---it
compels us to face the terrifying question, despite our desire to look
away. The declaration presents a difficult syntax or an accretion of
tensions and ambiguities within its organization: [**[can blacks have
life? What would such life mean within an antiblack world]{.mark}**?
What axiological measurement determines the mattering of the life in
question? Does the assembly of these terms shatter philosophical
coherence or what metaphysical infrastructure provides stability,
coherence, and intelligibility for the declartion? These questions of
value, meaning, stability, and intelligibility lead us to the terror of
the declaration, the question it conceals but engages: [**what
ontological ground provides the occasion for the declaration**?]{.mark}
Can such ground be assumed, and if not, is the declaration even possible
without it? "**[Black Lives Matter" assumes ontological
ground]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which propels the deployment of its terms
and sustains them throughout the treacheries of antiblack
epistemologies. Put differently, [**[the human being provides]{.mark} an
anchor for [the declaration]{.mark}**, and **[since]{.mark}** the being
of the **[human is invaluable]{.mark}**, [then]{.mark} **[black life
must also matter]{.mark}**, if the black is a human (]{.underline}the
declaration anchors mattering in the human's Being). But [we reach a
point of terror with this syllogistic reasoning]{.underline}. One must
take a step backward and ask the fundamental question: [**[is]{.mark}
the [black]{.mark}, in fact, a [human]{.mark} being? [Or can black(ness)
ground itself in the being of the human]{.mark}?** If it cannot, then on
what bases can we assert the mattering of black existence?]{.underline}
If it can, then why would the phrase need to be repeated and recited
incessantly? [**[Do the]{.mark} affirmative [declaration and its
insistence]{.mark} [undermine this]{.mark} very [ontological
ground?]{.mark}** The statement declares, then, too soon---a declaration
that is really an unanswered]{.underline} (or unanswerable)
[question]{.underline}. We must trace this question and declaration back
to its philosophical roots: the ~~Negro~~ Question.1 [This question
reemerges within a world of antiblack brutality, a world in which black
torture, dismemberment, fatality, and fracturing are routinized and
ritualized---a global, sadistic pleasure principle]{.underline}. I was
invited to meditate on this globalized sadism in the context of Michael
Brown's murder and the police state. The invitation filled me with dread
as I anticipated a festival of humanism in which presenters would share
solutions to the problem of antiblackness (if they even acknowledged
antiblackness) and inundate the audience with "yes we can!" rhetoric and
unbounded optimism. I decided to participate, despite this dread, once
students began asking me deep questions, questions that also filled them
with dread and confusion. I, of course, was correct about my misgivings.
[I listened to one speaker after the next describe a bright future,
where black life is valued and blacks are respected as humans---if we
just keep fighting, they said, "**[we're almost there]{.mark}**!" A
political scientist introduced statistics and graphs laying out voting
patterns and districts; he argued that **[blacks]{.mark} just [did not
realize how much power they had]{.mark}**]{.underline} (an unfortunate
ignorance, I guess). [**[If they]{.mark}** just **collectively [voted
they could change]{.mark}** antiblack **police [practices]{.mark}** and
make this world a better place. The audience clapped enthusiastically; I
remained silent]{.underline}. Next, [a professor of law implored the
audience to keep fighting for legal change because the law is a powerful
weapon for ending discrimination and restoring justice]{.underline}.
**[[We]{.underline}]{.mark}** just **[[need]{.mark}ed [to return to
the]{.mark} universal [principles that]{.mark} [founded our
Constitution]{.mark},]{.underline}** "liberty, equality, and justice!"
(I thought about the exception clause in the Thirteenth Amendment, the
Three-Fifths Compromise, and the way the sharecropping system exploited
the Fourteenth Amendment in order to reenslave through contract. I
continued to sit in silence.) The audience shouted and applauded. I felt
a pit in my stomach because I knew what I had to do; [it was my time to
step up to the podium---it was my nihilistic responsibility. I told the
audience there was no solution to the problem of antiblackness; it will
continue without end, as long as the world exists. Furthermore,
**[all]{.mark} the [solutions]{.mark} [presented]{.mark} [rely on
antiblack instruments to address antiblackness]{.mark}**, **[a vicious
and tortuous cycle that will only produce more pain and
disappointment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I also said that humanist affect
(**[[the good feeling we get from hopeful
solutions]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [will not translate into freedom,
justice, recognition, or resolution. It]{.underline} merely [**[provides
temporary reprieve]{.mark}** from the fact that blacks are not safe in
an antiblack world, a fact that can become overwhelming.]{.underline}
The form of antiblackness might alter, but antiblackness itself will
remain a constant---despite the power of our imagination and political
yearnings. I continued this nihilistic analysis of the situation until I
heard complete silence. A woman stood up after my presentation and
shouted, "[**[How dare you tell this to our youth! That is so very
negative]{.mark}**!]{.underline} Of course we can change things; we have
power, and we are free." Her voice began to increase in intensity. I
waited for her to finish and asked her, "[Then **[tell us how to
end]{.mark}** police **[brutality]{.mark}** and [**the** **slaughter**
**of**]{.mark} the **[youth]{.mark}** you want to protect from my
nihilism."]{.underline} ["If these solutions are so credible, **why have
[they consistently failed]{.mark}**? Are we awaiting for some novel,
extraordinary solution--- one no one had ever imagined---to end
antiblack violence and misery?"]{.underline} Silence. "[[**In what
manner will this 'power' deliver us from antiblackness**?]{.mark}" How
long must we insist on a humanity that is not recognized---an insistence
that humiliates in its inefficacy? "If we are progressing, why are black
youth being slaughtered at staggering rates in the twenty-first
century--- if we are, indeed, humans just like everyone
else?"]{.underline} People began to respond that things are getting
better, despite **[[the increasing death toll]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
the **[[unchecked power of the police state]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the
lack of conviction rates for police murdering blacks, **[[the prison
industrial complex and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the modern
**[[reenslavement]{.underline}]{.mark}** of an entire generation, the
unbelievable **[[black infant mortality rate, the lack of
jobs]{.underline}]{.mark}** for black youth [**[and debilitating
poverty]{.underline}**. "**[This is better?"]{.underline}**]{.mark} I
asked. "At least we are not slaves!" someone shouted. I asked them to
read the Thirteenth Amendment closely. But the intensity of the dialogic
exchange taught me that affect runs both ways: it is not just that
solutions make us feel good because we feel powerful/hopeful, but that
pressing the ontological question presents terror---the terror that
ontological security is gone, the terror that ethical claims no longer
have an anchor, and the terror of inhabiting existence outside the
precincts of humanity and its humanism. Ontological Terror engages this
question and the forms of terror it produces.2 [The event also **[put
the metaphysical infrastructure into perspective]{.mark}** for me. Two
philosophical forces were colluding]{.underline} (and at times
conflicting) [to orient the solutions proposed and the audiences'
responses, and **both [presented "free black" as a concept with meaning:
black humanism and postmetaphysics]{.mark}**. I use these two terms to
docket a certain posture toward metaphysics---and the ontological ground
metaphysics offers. **[Black humanism enters into romance with
metaphysics. It]{.mark} [appropriates]{.mark}** schematization,
**[calculation, technology, probability]{.mark}**, and
**universality**---all the instruments of metaphysical thinking---**[to
make]{.mark} epistemological, ethical, and ontological [claims]{.mark}**
[concerning]{.mark} [blackness]{.mark} and freedom. **[Freedom is
possible]{.mark}**]{.underline}, then, [**bec[ause metaphysics provides
it with ontology]{.mark}**; from there, all sorts of solutions,
policies, and practices emerge to address antiblackness.]{.underline}
[Scientific reasoning, technological innovation, and legality are tools
black humanists use to quantify suffering, measure progress, proffer
universal narratives of humanity, and reason with antiblack
institutions. All problems have solutions]{.underline} for black
humanists, and their task is to uncover the solution the problem
conceals, as this uncovering equates to an eradication of the problem.
[**[Black humanism relies on]{.mark}** an eclectic approach to
antiblackness]{.underline}--- **[[Hegelian synthesis, Kantian
rationalism]{.mark}, [Platonic]{.mark} [universals/idealism]{.mark},
[Cartesian representation, and
empiricism]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} In short, [black humanists
lay claim to the being of the human]{.underline} (and the human's
freedom) [through metaphysical thinking and instruments]{.underline}.
[Postmetaphysics, in contrast, attempts the surmounting or
twisting]{.underline} \[verwunden\] [of the ground and logic of
metaphysics]{.underline}.3 [It insists that metaphysics reproduces pain
and misery and restricts human freedom. Rep- resenting the human as an
object of scientific thinking]{.underline} (e.g., biology, economics,
law) [destroys the spontaneity and uniqueness of the human--- things
that make the human special. The ground, then, upon which metaphysics
relies is problematic, and this ground must be destroyed (i.e., twisted)
and deconstructed (i.e., displaced) to free the human.]{.underline}
**[[Postmetaphysics would advocate for a self-consumption of this ground
through hermeneutical strategies, unending deconstructions, and forms of
plurality]{.underline}]{.mark}** (such as hermeneutic nihilism). **[[The
post is rather a misnomer, if we think of post as an
overcoming]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[überwunden\]; **[[the
postmetaphysician will never overcome
metaphysics]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A residue will always remain, but
the postmetaphysician hopes to reduce this metaphysical residue to
render it inoperative. The postmetaphysician understands antiblackness
as a problem of metaphysics, especially the way scientific thinking has
classified being along racial difference and biology. The task of the
postmetaphysical project is to free blacks from the misery metaphysics
produces by undermining its ground. Hermeneutical strategies, which
contest ultimate foundations, would question the ground of race (racial
metaphysics) and its claim to universal truth. **[[Black humanism and
postmetaphysics]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, [[**leave the question
of being unattended as it concerns black(ness).**]{.underline}]{.mark}
Both assume being is applicable and operative---[black humanism relies
on metaphysical being and postmetaphysics relies on multiple
interpretations or manifestations of being.]{.underline} In other words,
**[[the human's being grounds both philosophical
perspectives]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although [**[postmetaphysics allows
for a capacious understanding of the human and Being, it still posits
being universally as it concerns freedom; no entity is without it, even
if it manifests differently, or as difference]{.mark}**,]{.underline} if
we follow Deleuze. This is to suggest that [both discourses proceed as
if the question of being has been settled and that we no longer need to
return to it---the question, indeed, has been elided in critical
discourses concerning blackness. **[Ontological Terror seeks to put the
question back in its proper place: at the center of any discourse about
Being]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [Ontological Terror meditates on this
(non)relation between blackness and Being by arguing that black being
incarnates metaphysical nothing, the terror of metaphysics, in an
antiblack world]{.underline}. [**[Blacks]{.mark}, then, [have function
but not]{.mark} [Being---the function of black(ness) is to give form to
a terrifying formlessness (nothing]{.mark})**.]{.underline} Being claims
function as its property (all functions rely on Being, according to this
logic, for philosophical pre sentation), but **[[the aim of black
nihilism is to expose the unbridgeable rift between Being and function
for blackness]{.mark}. The puzzle of blackness, then, is that it
functions in an antiblack world without being]{.underline}**---much like
"nothing" functions philosophically without our metaphysical
understanding of being, an extraordinary mystery. Put differently,
metaphysics is obsessed with both blackness and nothing, and the two
become synonyms for that which ruptures metaphysical organization and
form. The ~~Negro~~ is black because the ~~Negro~~ must assume the
function of nothing in a metaphysical world. The world needs this labor.
This obsession, however, also transforms into hatred, since nothing is
incorrigible---it shatters ontological ground and security. Nothing
terrifies metaphysics, and metaphysics attempts to dominate it by
turning nothing into an object of knowledge, something it can dominate,
analyze, calculate, and schematize. When I speak of function, I mean the
projection of nothing's terror onto black(ness) as a strategy of
metaphysics' will to power. How, then, does metaphysics dominate
nothing? By objectifying nothing through the black ~~Negro~~. In this
analysis, [metaphysics can never provide freedom or humanity for blacks,
since it is the objectification, domination, and extermination of blacks
that keep the metaphysical world intact. Metaphysics uses blacks to
maintain a sense of security and to sustain the fantasy of triumph---the
triumph over the nothing that limits human freedom. Without blacks, I
argue, **[nothing's terror debilitates metaphysical procedures,
epistemologies, boundaries]{.mark}, [and institutions]{.mark}**[. Black
freedom]{.mark}, then, [would constitute a form of world
destruction]{.mark}, and this is precisely why humanism has failed to
accomplish its romantic goals of equality, justice, and recognition. In
short, black humanism has neglected the relationship between black(ness)
and nothing in its yearning for belonging, acceptance, and
freedom.]{.underline} The ~~Negro~~ was invented to fulfill this
function for metaphysics, and the humanist dream of transforming
invention into human being is continually deferred (because it is
impossible). Ontological Terror challenges the claim that blacks are
human and can ground existence in the same being of the human. I argue
that blacks are introduced into the metaphysical world as available
equipment in human form. Black thinking, then, must return to the
question of Being and the relation between this question and the
antiblack violence sustaining the world. It is my contention that black
thinking is given a tremendous task: to approach the ontological abyss
and the metaphysical violence sustaining the world. [Ontological Terror
suggests that black thinking cannot be overcome--- we will never reach
the end of black thinking or its culmination, unlike the end of
philosophy describing postmetaphysical enterprise]{.underline}s.4 In
other words, [**[postmetaphysics]{.mark} has [broached the question of
being and]{.mark} has [commenced]{.mark} [the destruction]{.mark}
\[Destruktion\] [of the metaphysical infrastructure, which systemically
forgets being]{.mark}. [Postmetaphysics]{.mark}**,]{.underline} then,
**[[is a project of]{.mark} remnants]{.underline}**, as Santiago Zabala
suggests. [[After we have used hermeneutics, deconstruction, rhizomes,
and mathematical sets to devastate metaphysics, we are left with
ontological rubble]{.mark}---a trace of metaphysics and a reconstructed
being. **[Postmetaphysics]{.mark}**, then, **[must ask, "How is it going
with Being?"]{.mark}** Or what is the state of Being in this
contemporary moment, and how does the world remain open to Being's
unfolding and happening]{.underline} (as well as its withdrawal and
abandoning of Dasein)? ["**How is it going with Being?" is [the
fundamental question of our]{.mark} era, according to postmetaphysics;
[only the twisting and severe rearranging]{.mark}**]{.underline}
\[verwunden\] [**[of metaphysics can usher this question into the
world.]{.mark}** [Both **metaphysics and postmetaphysics,**]{.mark}
however, **[have forgotten]{.mark} [the ~~Negro~~ Black, just as they
have forgotten Being]{.mark}---to remember Being one must also remember
the ~~Negro~~**]{.underline}. The ~~Negro~~ Question and the Question of
Being are intertwined. Postmetaphysical enterprises reach a limit in
destruction, since it is the Negro that sustains metaphysics and enables
the forgetting of Being (i.e., metaphysics can forget Being because it
uses the ~~Negro~~ to project nothing's terror and forget Being). In a
sense, the global use of the Negro fulfills the ontological function of
forgetting Being's terror, majesty, and incorrigibility. The consequence
of this is that as long as postmetaphysical enterprises leave the
~~Negro~~ unattended in their thinking, it inadvertently sustains
metaphysical pain and violence. This, I argue, is why [**[we will never
overcome]{.mark} \[überwunden\] [metaphysics because the world cannot
overcome the ~~Negro~~ Black---the world needs the ~~Negro~~ Black, even
as the world despises it]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This is, of course, a
Heideggerian approach to the thinking of Being and Nothing. More than
any other philosopher, Heidegger pursued meta physical violence and the
question of Being relentlessly, and for this reason I find his
philosophy indispensable and necessary. Ontological Terror thinks with
and against Heidegger, since I believe Heidegger's destruction of
metaphysics can assist black studies in the tremendous task of thinking
Being and blackness, as Grant Farred has suggested.5 Heidegger's
Destruktion covers a wide range of philosophical issues, and it is not
my objective to address all of these complexities; my interest is the
relation between Heidegger's critique of metaphysical violence,
available equipment, and the task of remembering as it concerns
blackness. What I hope to broach in this book, with all the aporias such
as broaching encounters, is that the ~~Negro~~ is the missing element in
Heidegger's thinking (as well as in that of those postmetaphysicians
indebted to Heidegger, such as JeanLuc Nancy, Giorgio Agamben, Alain
Badiou, and Gianni Vattimo). If, as we learn in Being and Time, Dasein
uses tools to experience its thrownness in the world (establishing its
facticity) and to develop its unique project oriented toward the future
(projectionality), the ~~Negro~~---as commodity, object, slave, putative
backdrop, prisoner, refugee, and corpse---is the quintessential tool
Dasein uses. The use of the ~~Negro~~ metaphysically and ontologically,
as a tool, is what black thinking is tasked with pursuing. Thus, black
thinking (and postmetaphysics) must ask the unasked question "How is it
going with black being?" Without broaching this question, **[[all forms
of destruction are just reconstitutions, since the world continues to
use the ~~Negro~~ (as black and nothing) to forget Being and the
sadistic pleasure of this forgetfulness.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### The 1ac is not art, it's an advertisement -- their attempt to trade aesthetics for the ballot colludes with the project of commercialization that values artwork insofar as it has productive potential -- this process of commodification renders existence banal and sterilized as we're plunged into a sea of indifference

**Baudrillard, 93** \[Jean, "*The* *Transparency of Evil: Essays on
Extreme Phenomena*," pg. 14-5,\] //Don Markos

[We see **[Art proliferating]{.mark}** wherever we turn; talk about Art
is **[increasing]{.mark}** even **[more rapidly]{.mark}**. But the
**[soul of Art]{.mark}** - Art as **[adventure]{.mark}**, Art with its
**[power of illusion]{.mark},** its capacity for **[negating
reality]{.mark}**, for setting up an **[\'other scene\']{.mark}** in
opposition to reality, where things obey a [**higher set**]{.mark} of
[**rules**,]{.mark} a **[transcendent figure]{.mark}** in which beings,
like line and colour on a canvas, are apt to **[lose their
meaning]{.mark}**, to **[extend themselves]{.mark}**]{.underline} beyond
their own raison d\'etre, and[, in an **urgent process** of
**seduction**, to **rediscover** their **ideal form**]{.underline} (even
though this form may be that of their own destruction) - [in this sense,
**Art is gone**. Art has disappeared as a **symbolic** **pact**, as
something thus **clearly distinct** from that **pure** and **simple
production** of aesthetic values, that proliferation of **signs** **ad
infinitum**, that recycling of **past** and **present** forms, which we
call **\'culture\'**. There are no more **fundamental rules**, no more
**criteria** of **judgement** or of pleasure. In the **aesthetic realm**
of today there is no longer **any God** to recognize his
own]{.underline}. Or, to use a different metaphor, [[there is no **gold
standard** of **aesthetic judgement** or **pleasure**]{.mark}. The
situation resembles that of a **currency** which may not be
**exchanged** : it can **only float,** its only reference itself,
impossible to **convert** into **real value** or **wealth**.
Art]{.underline}, too, [must **circulate** at **top speed**, and is
**impossible to exchange**. \'Works\' of art are indeed no longer
exchanged, whether for each other or against a **referential
value**.]{.underline} They no longer have that secret collusiveness
which is the strength of a culture. [We no longer read such works - we
merely **decode them** according to ever more **contradictory
criteria**.]{.underline} Nothing in this sphere conflicts with anything
else. Neo-Geometrism, Neo-Expressionism, New Abstraction, New
Representationalism - all coexist with a marvellous facility amid
general indifference. [It is only because none of these tendencies has
[**any soul** of its own that they can all **inhabit** the same
**cultural space;** only because they arouse nothing but **profound
indifference**]{.mark} in us that we can **accept them** all
**simultaneously**. The art world presents a **curious aspect.** It is
as though **art** and **artistic** **inspiration** had entered a **kind
of stasis** - as though everything which had **developed magnificently**
over **several centuries** had suddenly been **immobilized**,
**paralysed** by its own **image** and its own **riches**. Behind the
whole **convulsive movement** of **modern art** lies a kind of
**inertia**, something that can **no** **longer transcend itself** and
has therefore turned **in upon itself,** merely repeating itself at a
**faster** and **faster rate**. On the one hand,]{.underline} then, [a
**stasis** of the **living form** of **art**, and at the same time a
**proliferative tendency**, **wild hyperbole**, and **endless
variations** on all earlier forms]{.underline} (the life, moving of
itself, of that which is dead) All this is logical enough: [where there
is **stasis**, there is **metastasis**]{.underline}. When a living form
becomes disordered, when (as in cancer) a genetically determined set of
rules ceases to function, the cells begin to proliferate chaotically .
[Just as some **biological disorders** indicate a break in the genetic
code, so the [**present disorder** in **art** may be interpreted as a
**fundamental** **break** in the secret code of **aesthetics**]{.mark}.
By its liberation of **form**, **line**, **colour**, and **aesthetic
notions**]{.underline} - as by its mixing up of all cultures, all
styles - [our society has given rise to a **general aestheticization**:
all forms of culture]{.underline} - not excluding anti-cultural ones -
[are **promoted** and all models of **representation** and
**anti-representation** are taken on board. Whereas art was once
[**essentially a utopia** - that is to say, **ultimately
unrealizable** - today this utopia has been **realized** : thanks to the
**media**, computer **science** and **video technology**]{.mark},
everyone is now **potentially a creator**. Even **antiart**, the most
radical of artistic utopias, was realized once Duchamp had mounted his
bottle-dryer and Andy Warhol had wished he was a machine . All the
**industrial machinery** in the world has acquired an **aesthetic**
**dimension**; all the world\'s **insignificance** has been transfigured
by the **aestheticizing process.** It is often said that the West\'s
**great undertaking** is the **commercialization** of the **whole
world**, the hitching of the **fate** of **everything** to the **fate**
of the **commodity**. That **great undertaking** will turn out rather to
have been the **aestheticization** of the **whole world** - its
cosmopolitan **spectacularization**, its **transformation** into
**images**, its semiological organization. What we are witnessing,
beyond the **materialist** **rule** of the **commodity**, is a
semio-orgy of everything by **means of advertising**, the **media**, or
**images**. No matter how [**marginal**, or **banal**, or even
**obscene** it may be, everything is subject to **aestheticization**,
**culturalization**, **museumification**.]{.mark} Everything is
**said**, everything is **exposed**, everything **acquires the force**,
or the **manner**, of a **sign**. The system **runs less** on the
**surplus-value** of the **commodity** than on the **aesthetic
surplus-value** of the **sign**.]{.underline}

#### The affirmative has unknowingly stumbled into the paradox of art and life itself -- if everything is art then nothing is, if everything is beautiful then nothing is -- we lose all determinants and meaning as boundaries, borders, and limits are eviscerated 

**Fernando, 12** \[Jeremy, Jean Baudrillard Fellow at the European
Graduate School, "*Writing Death*,"\] //Don Markos

And it is not as if doing so comes without a price: [once [something is
**completely calculable**]{.mark}, it is also [**completely
exchangeable**, completely **transparent**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Here,
we might momentarily tune in to Jean Baudrillard and attend to his
warning that [**total transparency** is the point where \"every
**individual category** is subject to **contamination**,
**substitution** is possible between **any sphere** and **any other**:
there is **total confusion** of types:\']{.underline} Thus, \"[each
category is **generalised** to the **greatest possible extent**, so that
it eventually loses **all specificity** and is reabsorbed by **all the
other** categories. When **everything** is political, [**nothing** is
political anymore, the **word itself** is **meaningless**]{.mark}. When
**everything** is [**sexual**, **nothing** is **sexual** anymore, and
sex **loses its determinants.**]{.mark} When **everything is
aesthetic**, nothing is **beautiful** or **ugly** anymore, and **art**
itself **disappears**. This [paradoxical state of
affairs]{.mark}]{.underline} \... [is simultaneously the [**complete
actualisation** of an idea, the **perfect realisation** of the whole
tendency of modernity, and the **negation** of the **idea** and that
tendency]{.mark}, their **annihilation by virtue** of their very
success, by virtue of their **extension** beyond their **own
bounds**]{.underline} \... :[\' In order for **any response** to be
possible, there have to be **boundaries**, **borders**,
**limits**.]{.underline} For, [**without the separation**, the space,
one would not be able to **even begin communicating** with another;
everything would just **be the same**.]{.underline} In other words,
[what **has to be maintained** is an **exteriority**, a **finitude** to
all gestures of **knowing**. This also means that all responding, all
response, is **always already finite**.]{.underline} If this were so, [a
question remains with us: what of the situation in which the call was
made? [The trouble is: if one can never be sure **what the call even
is,** when, or even where, it **came from**-if one is blind to both the
**source** and the **object** of the call-one is attempting to
**respond** to a **complete unknown**, an **absolute
unknowability**.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, [even though there is no
**possibility** of **verification**, one is still responding-this
suggests that there is still a **measure of exchange** that is taking
place. Whether this exchange can be measured is yet **another
question**; one that]{.underline} perhaps [can **never be
addressed**.]{.underline} And [[since there is an exchange that takes
place in spite of the fact that the exchange may be impossible, this
