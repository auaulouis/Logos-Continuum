[[Russia has put forward a]{.underline} **[highly contentious

in order **[to lower tensions]{.mark}** in Europe]{.underline} and
defuse the crisis over Ukraine, including many [elements that have
**already been ruled out.**]{.underline}

[The demands include a]{.underline} ban on Ukraine entering Nato and a
[limit to the **deployment of troops and weapons** to Nato's eastern
flank]{.underline}, [in effect returning Nato forces to where they were
stationed in **1997**]{.underline}, before an eastward expansion.

The eight-point draft treaty was released by Russia's foreign ministry
as its forces massed within striking distance of Ukraine's borders.
Moscow said ignoring its interests would lead to a "military response"
similar to the Cuban missile crisis of 1962.

Vladimir [[Putin]{.mark} has [demanded]{.mark}]{.underline} that the
west provide Russia "[[**legal guarantees**" of]{.mark} its
[security]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [the Kremlin's aggressive [proposals
are]{.mark}]{.underline} likely to be rejected in western capitals as
[[an attempt to formalise a]{.mark} new **[Russian s]{.mark}**phere
**[o]{.mark}**f **[i]{.mark}**nfluence over eastern Europe]{.underline}.

[The [demands]{.mark}]{.underline}, spelled out by Moscow in full for
the first time, [were handed over]{.underline} to the US this week.
[They include a demand [that Nato **remove**]{.mark} **any [troops or
weapons]{.mark}** [deployed to]{.mark} countries that entered the
alliance after 1997]{.underline}, [which would **include much of
[eastern Europe]{.mark}**, including Poland,]{.underline} the former
Soviet countries of [Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, and the Balkan
countries.]{.underline}

[Russia has also demanded [that Nato rule out]{.mark} **further
[expansion]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including the accession of Ukraine
into the alliance, [[and that it does not hold drills
without]{.underline}]{.mark} previous **[[agreement from
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Ukraine, eastern Europe, in Caucasus
countries such as Georgia or in Central Asia.

[Those [proposals are]{.mark}]{.underline} likely to be
**[[viewed]{.mark} extremely [negatively by Nato]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[countries]{.mark}, in particular Poland and the Baltic
states]{.underline}. They have warned that Russia is attempting to
re-establish a sphere of influence in the region and view the document
as proof Moscow is seeking to limit their sovereignty.

BRUSSELS --- As envoys made progress in peace talks on Tuesday, [[Russia
offered **concessions**]{.mark} that signaled a more realistic course
for the war in Ukraine]{.underline}, [[while indicating it is also in
**no hurry** to **end** the conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to
diplomats and analysts.

[Russia's deputy defense minister]{.underline}, Aleksandr Fomin,
[presented the decision to "sharply reduce" military activity around the
Ukrainian capital, Kyiv]{.underline}, and the northern city of Chernihiv
as a gesture "to increase mutual trust for future negotiations."

"De-escalation is a euphemism for retreat," said Lawrence Freedman,
emeritus professor of War Studies at King's College London. "[[Russia is
adjusting its goals to reality, because war is]{.mark} quite
[empirical]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said. "It's not a ruse to say that
they are concentrating on the Donbas, because in reality that's all they
can do."

[Some [analysts say]{.mark} such [an agreement
would]{.mark}]{.underline}, at minimum, h[ave to [give Russia control of
**Mariupol**]{.mark}, the besieged port city in Ukraine that is still
somehow holding out, to [create a]{.mark} secure [land route
between]{.mark} two areas that Russia occupies: **[Crimea]{.mark}** to
the west, [and]{.mark} the **[Donbas]{.mark}** to the east.]{.underline}
And it would also, they say, have to cede control over the two
administrative regions in the Donbas, Luhansk and Donetsk, which Mr.
Putin has already declared to be independent republics.

Nor will Mr. Putin easily end the war, Mr. Heisbourg said. If he takes
the area east of the Dnieper, "that may be enough for now, but [[he will
rebuild his army and continue."]{.underline}]{.mark}

For both sides, said Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House, the
London research institution, "[[the negotiations are **not
serious**]{.underline}]{.mark}, in the sense that [[negotiations]{.mark}
now for both sides [are a **continuation** of the war, **not** a
**solution**]{.mark}]{.underline}." Russia can concentrate on the east,
and Ukraine will find it hard to move from its agile defense to serious
counterattacks, he said. "And Putin hasn't forgotten about Kyiv."

Even [if Mr. Putin can control and "settle" for another
partition]{.underline} of Ukraine in the east, "Ukraine has to sign up
for it, and if not, I don't think we lift the sanctions," Mr. Niblett
said.

His colleague, Mathieu Boulègue, a French scholar who studies the
Russian military, agrees that [[**Russia** is **not** negotiating in
**good faith**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[but "**testing** the **waters**
and applying for time, to **regroup**]{.mark} and **re-equip**
[militarily]{.mark} and make more gains on the ground."]{.underline}

The Russian military appears to have taken control of what might be
called Phase 2 of a botched operation, he said, which should have been
Phase 1. Taking Mariupol, the land bridge and the Donbas "would have
been the grown-up military plan." [Modern warfare is half information
warfare, Mr. Boulègue said, "and success is what you make of it,"
especially in a repressive media environment as in Russia
now.]{.underline}

The Russian forces' inability to capture cities and keep territory is
apparent after a month, he said, "so [strategic goals have had to
change."]{.underline}

But to completely withdraw from Kyiv would allow the Ukrainians to
reinforce the Donbas region and give them a significant victory,
suggested Michael Kofman, director of Russia Studies at CNA, a defense
research institution in Virginia, [in a
tweet.](https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1508795729728487427)

Traveling in Morocco, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken also
cast doubt on Russia's pledge to reduce hostilities. "[[There is what
Russia **says** and there's what Russia **does**]{.mark},"]{.underline}
he said on Tuesday. "We're focused on the latter. And what Russia is
doing is the continued brutalization of Ukraine and its people and that
continues as we speak."

[[Russia did **not** stop fighting after]{.mark} the **annexation** of
**[Crimea]{.mark}** in 2014]{.underline}, but actively supported the
separatists in the Donbas, said Ian Bond, a former British diplomat in
Russia and the head of foreign policy for the Center for European
Reform. "[I'm a **skeptic** about the Russians giving up on the
**war**]{.underline}," he said. "We've seen this movie before in 2014
and 2015. I view this as only a pause."

Ian Garner, a historian of Russian propaganda, [pointed out on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/irgarner/status/1508823205011730442) that
"[Putin's Russia --- indeed, post-Soviet Russia]{.underline} --- has
been engaged in mucky, endless conflicts for years," citing Transnistria
in Moldova, Abkhazia in Georgia and the Donbas, all areas in other
countries where Russian forces back separatist movements. "[Not ended,
maybe," he said, but "in the **intermission**."]{.underline}

Ukrainian and Western officials also suggested that Russia would be
willing for a demilitarized Ukraine to join the European Union, so long
as it [forswore joining NATO or hosting any foreign forces.]{.underline}

But [security [**analysts questioned** the **sincerity** of]{.mark} such
[an agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Mr. Bond said that [the problem with Ukraine's notion of neutrality
is]{.underline} that so far [**none** of the countries it wants to
guarantee it would agree to do so]{.underline}. It would be like NATO
membership with collective defense by another name, so highly unlikely,
he said.

As for [European Union membership]{.underline}, Mr. Niblett said, that
would represent [the largest danger to Mr. Putin]{.underline}, who
helped stimulate the 2014 revolt in Ukraine when he forced the
then-president, Viktor Yanukovych, to renege on a trade agreement with
the bloc. [If Ukraine joined now]{.underline}, Mr. Niblett said, [the
country would develop economically even faster]{.underline}, in contrast
to Russia, "and [you would end up with a South Korea next to a North
Korea, and I can't see Putin accepting that."]{.underline}

Even more, he said, the [European Union treaties contain a collective
defense promise]{.underline} as well.

//smarx, AZG\]

It is hard to imagine that [U.S.-Russian relations]{.underline} could
get much worse, but sadly, they are [unlikely to get better anytime
soon]{.underline}. Over the past two decades, Russian President Vladimir
[[Putin]{.mark}]{.underline} has [defined his country's
[interests]{.mark} in ways that are **[incompatible with the]{.mark}
interests** of the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and its European
allies.]{.underline} The latter believe that [[democracy]{.mark}, the
[rule of law]{.mark}, and the provision of [security to]{.mark} eastern
[Europea]{.mark}n countries enhance stability;
[Putin]{.mark}]{.underline}, meanwhile, [[considers]{.mark} the spread
of **[democracy]{.mark} to be [a threat to his
regime]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and believes that having vulnerable
neighbors enhances Russian security]{.underline}.

[**Any sustained improvement** of relations]{.underline} between the
United States and Russia beyond progress on arms control (such as the
recent extension of the New START treaty) [would require]{.underline}
one of two concessions: either [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates **[shelves its foundational support for
democracy]{.underline}** [and formally]{.underline} **[recognizes a
Russian-privileged sphere of influence]{.underline}** in the former
Soviet Union [or the Russian president decides his interests are not
threatened by greater democracy]{.underline} in the region
[or]{.underline} by having [fully sovereign neighbors]{.underline}.
**[Neither is likely to materialize]{.underline}** in the near future.
The election of U.S. President Joe [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}, who has
[[made]{.mark} support for [democracy]{.mark} at home and abroad [the
**centerpiece of his presidency**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[signals]{.underline} that [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
**[will not cease]{.underline}** [to champion traditional democratic
values in Europe]{.underline} for at least the next four years.
Meanwhile, [as long as Putin remains in power]{.underline},
[Moscow]{.underline}'s policy [will]{.underline} continue to [be marked
by a fear of democracy and]{.underline} of the [full sovereignty of
Russia's neighbors.]{.underline}

THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM

[U.S. decision-makers]{.underline} approached the post--Cold War world
with a clear lesson from the American experience in the twentieth
century. Like many others, [they drew a link between U.S. disengagement
from Europe after W]{.underline}orld [W]{.underline}ar [I]{.underline}
[and the onset of W]{.underline}orld [W]{.underline}ar [II]{.underline}
just two decades later. They also saw the United States' decision to
remain in Europe in the face of potential Soviet aggression after the
end of World War II as having saved Western Europe from a communist
fate. For U.S. officials, then, continued American dominance over
European security through NATO was necessary to keep the peace in the
uncertain times following the Cold War. The outbreak of war in
Yugoslavia exacerbated those fears, feeding the narrative that without
the United States, nationalism was waiting to be unleashed and conflict
could erupt anywhere in the region.

But the United States also sought to reassure first the Soviets and then
the Russians that the West would not take advantage of the end of
Moscow's domination of eastern Europe to undermine the former
superpower's security. When U.S. President Bill [Clinton
informed]{.underline} Russian President [Boris Yeltsin]{.underline} in
September 1994 [of plans to move forward with NATO
enlargement]{.underline}, [he said]{.underline}, "[I don't want you to
believe that I wake up every morning thinking only about how to make the
Warsaw Pact countries a part of NATO]{.underline}---**[that's not the
way I look at it.]{.underline}** What I do think about is how to use
NATO expansion to advance the broader, higher goal of European security,
unity and integration---a goal I know you share."

That quote succinctly summarizes the differences between the United
States and Russia during the Yeltsin presidency. For the United States,
NATO was the right instrument to achieve European stability and security
because it enabled the United States to remain in charge. The U.S.
president argued as much and sought to prove that he was not trying to
harm Russia by exploiting the Warsaw Pact's collapse. But American
leadership was precisely what made NATO the wrong instrument from
Russia's perspective. Yeltsin, although he might have agreed with
Clinton's objective of fostering European unity, did not share his
American counterpart's belief that NATO was the best means to achieve
it---nor did any other top Russian official. Under the U.S. leadership
of NATO, junior partnership would have been the best available option
for Russia. But given Russian opposition to such an arrangement, it was
ultimately left out of the Europe that the United States sought to build
through the alliance.

Yeltsin had staked his political fortunes on bringing his country into
the West. Since his domestic political battle with Mikhail Gorbachev in
the waning months of the Soviet Union, Yeltsin had sought to win favor
by being more pro-Western, pro-democracy, and pro-market than the Soviet
leader. He was too weak to oppose American policies, so he took what he
could get---not just financial assistance from the United States, its
allies, and international financial institutions but also symbols that
he was being treated like an equal. These included the NATO-Russia
Founding Act---which established a partnership between the West and
Russia as invitations to join the alliance were extended to the Czech
Republic, Hungary, and Poland---and Russian participation in the G-7
group of advanced industrialized democracies, creating the G-8.

By the end of the 1990s, it seemed that for all the challenges in
relations between the United States and Russia (most notably over NATO's
78-day bombing campaign of Serbia on behalf of the Kosovars), the United
States and Europe had managed to overcome Cold War divisions and stave
off the worst of nationalism in Europe. Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic
was no longer able to unleash terror in the western Balkans; the Czech
Republic, Hungary, and Poland joined NATO and others were soon to
follow; the European Union was moving forward with its own expansion
across Europe; and Russia still seemed oriented toward the West. In
November 1999, Clinton visited his alma mater, Georgetown University, to
commemorate the tenth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. It
was, in a sense, the valedictory of his effort to build on President
George H. W. Bush's vision of a Europe "whole and free." Clinton
reminded his audience that he had set out to "do for the Eastern half of
Europe what we helped to do for the Western half after World War II." As
for Russia, he argued, its "transformation has just begun. It is
incomplete. It is awkward. Sometimes it is not pretty, but we have a
profound stake in its success."

Clinton also declared, "Now we are at the height of our power and
prosperity." He meant it as a confirmation that the United States was
capable of shaping global affairs to its liking. After all, he had made
the notion of the United States as the "indispensable nation" a hallmark
of his presidency. Unfortunately, the belief that the United States was
at the height of its power and prosperity turned out to be a prophecy,
as others, including Russia, gained more power, and the United States'
ability to dominate those countries declined dramatically.

RUSSIA'S RETURN

Reflecting on the 1990s, Putin saw humiliation for Russia. He believed
that the West was working to impose its vision of world order. The
collapse of the Soviet Union was "the greatest geopolitical catastrophe
of the century," Putin declared. "As for the Russian people, it became a
genuine tragedy. Tens of millions of our fellow citizens and countrymen
found themselves beyond the fringes of Russian territory."

Putin was not suggesting that he wanted to re-create the USSR. But
rather than seek to integrate Russia into the West as his anti-Soviet
predecessor had done---which inevitably meant relegating Russia to the
role of junior partner to the United States---Putin sought to build an
independent great power, one that could engage with the West on its own
terms and dominate its immediate neighborhood. Early in Putin's
presidency, his policies were not necessarily antagonistic but sought to
free Russia from Western, and especially American, interference.

From an American perspective, NATO enlargement, the 1999 Kosovo war, the
2002 unilateral American withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty (ABM Treaty), the 2003 Iraq war, and support for the 2003--5
"color revolutions" in Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and Ukraine were discrete
policies. [U.S. officials saw themselves not as harming Russian
interests but rather as]{.underline} **[fostering democracy and the rule
of law]{.underline}** [across]{.underline} central and eastern
[Europe]{.underline}, protecting the Kosovars from Milosevic's brutal
regime, [creating the ability to defend the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its allies]{.underline} from Iran's ballistic
missile threat, eliminating the possibility that Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein could threaten the world with weapons of mass destruction, and
[supporting reformers [**trying to build democracy** in fragile
states.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Reflecting on the 1990s, Putin saw humiliation for Russia.

The Russian perspective starkly differed. Officials in Moscow watched
the United States not only keep its Cold War alliance but expand it,
incorporating territory formerly controlled by the Soviet Union,
including Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. When NATO went to war against
Serbia in 1999, it did so over Russian objections and without going
through the UN Security Council---where Russia's status as a permanent
member would have allowed it to veto the action. A mere four years
later, NATO went to war against Iraq, again without Security Council
authorization and again brushing aside Russian (as well as French and
German) opposition. [Many in Moscow viewed the United States' departure
from the ABM Treaty as degrading Russia's nuclear deterrent]{.underline}
(particularly [after the]{.underline} George W. [Bush administration
announced its plans to build a missile defense system with interceptors
and a radar]{.underline} to be stationed in Poland and the Czech
Republic, respectively). And for Putin, [[the "color revolutions"
were]{.mark} not evidence of civil society flourishing but rather
confirmation that [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [was [pursuing regime change in
Europe,]{.mark} [including]{.mark} in Russia.]{.underline} [For
Moscow]{.underline}, then, [the same events that, from the American
perspective]{.underline}, [were discrete policies having little to do
with Russia built a narrative of a U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates **[[seeking to impose]{.underline}]{.mark}** [its
will and [principles on others]{.mark} to the detriment of Russian
interests.]{.underline}

In 2007, [[Putin]{.mark} went to the annual]{.underline} Munich Security
[Conference and gave a speech [**venting his opposition** to]{.mark}
U.S. actions]{.underline} on these grounds. [He complained about
[American unilateralism]{.mark}]{.underline}: "**[One single center of
power.]{.underline}** [One single center of force. One single center of
decision-makin]{.underline}g. **[This is [the world of one
master]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [one sovereign]{.underline}." He argued
that "the process of [NATO expansion has nothing to do with
modernization of the alliance]{.underline}," declaring, "[We have the
right to ask, 'Against whom is this expansion directed?'"]{.underline}

And always, [there was Ukraine, which Putin told]{.underline} President
George W. [Bush]{.underline} in 2008 [was **"not even a
country."**]{.underline} Yeltsin a decade earlier had warned Clinton
that he could not accept Ukraine's membership in NATO and sought a
private agreement that the United States would not pursue it. By
February 2008, U.S. Ambassador to Russia William Burns was telling his
superiors in Washington, "Ukrainian entry into NATO is the brightest of
all redlines for the Russian elite (not just Putin)." He warned that
Russian officials would view offering a Membership Action Plan (MAP)---a
step toward NATO membership---to Ukraine (and Georgia) at the upcoming
NATO summit as "throwing down the strategic gauntlet."

French and German opposition to offering Ukraine and Georgia MAPs took
the idea off the table, but the compromise forged within the alliance
led to a NATO summit declaration that Ukraine and Georgia "will become
members of NATO." By going to war with Georgia in 2008 and invading
Ukraine in 2014, Putin confirmed what Burns had warned against: Putin
would not tolerate the crossing of certain redlines perceived as too
threatening to Russia's interests.

Putin sought to build an independent great power, one that could engage
with the West on its own terms.

[The conflicts over [Ukraine and Georgia reflect]{.mark}ed
the]{.underline} United States' and Russia's **[[divergent]{.mark}
definitions of their [interests]{.mark}]{.underline}** during the George
W. Bush and Putin years. As Clinton argued to Yeltsin in 1994, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [believed expanding Western
institutions would offer much-needed stability]{.underline} and security
to eastern European countries. Meanwhile, [Russia was
protecting]{.underline} what it viewed as [its privileged sphere of
influence]{.underline} from Western norms, rules, and institutions. [The
West believed sovereign countries could **make their own
choices**]{.underline} about their future, [which]{.underline}, in turn,
[was viewed in Moscow as **undermining Russian interests**]{.underline}
and, potentially, even its regime.

[There appeared to be a **brief respite from these conflicts** with the
"**reset,"**]{.underline} a policy undertaken by President Barack Obama
with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev (who was keeping the presidential
seat warm while Vladimir Putin held the post of prime minister). The
reset was a transactional approach to policy, with each side recognizing
the other's core interests. Obama made clear he would not promote
Ukrainian and Georgian membership in NATO and abandoned the missile
defense plan launched by the Bush administration in favor of a different
missile defense deployment more clearly designed to combat Iran.
Meanwhile, Russia agreed to support stiffer sanctions on Iran to induce
Tehran to abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Most important, Moscow
allowed the United States to create a new corridor to resupply
Afghanistan through Russian-controlled airspace, which meant that the
United States was no longer completely reliant on Pakistan. The two
countries also agreed that it was in their mutual interest to forge a
new arms control agreement, the New START treaty, which would further
reduce their number of strategic nuclear weapons and provide
verification measures to uphold it.

[Alas, the **reset ended**]{.underline}. Although [the Russians
abstained during the]{.underline} Security Council's [vote authorizing
NATO to launch airstrikes against Libya]{.underline} in 2011 to protect
the population of Benghazi, [Putin fumed when the operation precipitated
the]{.underline} overthrow and [death of President]{.underline} Muammar
[al-Qaddafi.]{.underline} Later that year, **[protests erupted in
Russia]{.underline}** around the parliamentary elections, [and Putin
interpreted]{.underline} then Secretary of State Hillary Rodham
[Clinton's statements as **egging on his opponents**]{.underline}. In
2013, Edward Snowden's leaks of National Security Agency documents,
followed by his receiving asylum in Russia, grabbed headlines. [[The
**relationship truly came undone** when Putin annexed Crimea and
started]{.mark} a civil war in]{.underline} eastern
[[Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} the following year. [[Large countries
invading]{.mark} their [smaller neighbors]{.mark}]{.underline},
particularly in Europe, [had been part of a bygone]{.underline} era and
shocked Europeans who had come to believe that the creation and
expansion of the European Union had definitively made war on the
continent a thing of the past. In response, [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [and its
allies [slapped sanctions]{.mark} on Russia. It seemed [the relationship
**could not get**]{.mark} **much [worse.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

DOOMED TO FAIL

[[Any attempt]{.mark} by]{.underline} Donald [Trump [to improve the
relationship was **doomed from the start**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Having
been compromised by Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential
election, Trump could not afford to be seen as doing Putin's bidding,
especially in a number of key areas. [Congress]{.underline}, meanwhile,
[was not only unwilling to lift sanctions on Russia but added to them

and career officials alike---[remained committed to]{.underline}
continuing the United States' policy of providing reassurance to NATO's
eastern neighbors and [[reinforcing deterrence]{.mark} in the aftermath

air and sea [patrols in the Baltic]{.underline} Sea [and Black

**exacerbating existing political polarization**]{.mark} in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [[Putin achieved]{.mark} very
[little]{.mark} by interfering in U.S. domestic politics]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [the]{.underline} Trump administration's National Defense
[Strategy]{.underline} and National Security Strategy [made clear that
[Russia was]{.mark} now, along with China, [a **"strategic
competitor."**]{.mark}]{.underline} And with the urging of his then
National Security Adviser John Bolton, [[Trump pulled out of the]{.mark}

[[Nuclear]{.mark} F]{.underline}orces [[Treaty over]{.mark} the
**long-standing complaint of [Russian violations.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Although his predecessor had refused to commit to extending the New
START treaty, Biden agreed with the Russians on a five-year extension
shortly after he entered office. Addressing the dangers of nuclear
weapons is the one area in which the interests of the two sides allow
for greater cooperation. Arms control emerged as a staple of the
relationship in the aftermath of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, focusing
first on limiting nuclear testing and later on capping the numbers of
missiles and warheads. It is the one issue that creates the optic of two
superpowers, thereby giving Russia its cherished status as an equal to
the United States. And it is in the interests of both sides to limit
nuclear weapons and provide verification measures to prevent breaches.

A BLEAK FUTURE

In 1993, [Clinton decided to back Yeltsin as the best hope for a
U.S.-Russian partnership]{.underline}. Eight years later, George W.
[Bush looked Putin in the eye and came away believing he had peered into
the Russian president's soul. [Obama]{.mark}]{.underline} took office in
2009 [**[seeking a reset]{.mark}** of U.S.-Russian
relations]{.underline} with his first-term counterpart, Medvedev. Eight
years later, Trump began his presidency under the cloud of Russian
interference in the U.S. election but seeming to believe whatever Putin
told him.

In each case, [**[early high hopes]{.mark}** for the U.S.-Russian
relationship soon **[gave way to bitter
realities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The 1999 NATO bombing campaign
against Serbia created the worst conflict between the two
powers]{.underline} during the Clinton-Yeltsin years. In 2008, [the
Russian-Georgian war left in tatters a relationship that had
foundered]{.underline} since the 2003 U.S. decision to go to war in
Iraq. Early in Obama's second term, [Putin ordered the
invasion]{.underline} of Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea, [leading
the West to impose sanctions and bolster its military
presence]{.underline} in eastern Europe. [And **[regardless of
Trump's]{.mark} strange [affinity]{.mark}** [for Putin]{.mark},
U.S.-Russian [relations]{.mark} **continued to [deteriorate]{.mark}**
during his term]{.underline}.

[[As Biden begins]{.mark} his presidency, **one aspect of U.S.-Russian
[relations is over]{.mark}:** the high hopes for what an incoming U.S.
president can achieve. [The SolarWinds hack, Russian election
interference]{.mark}, the conflict in [Ukraine, and]{.mark} the
[poisoning]{.mark} and arrest of [the Russian]{.mark} opposition
[leader]{.mark}]{.underline} Alexei [Navalny are just some of the issues
that [will **hinder**]{.mark} **any return** to [a]{.mark} more positive
U.S.-Russian [relationship]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} But ever since
Putin first became president more than 20 years ago, [the bigger issue
has been the [clashing ambitions that]{.mark} U.S. and Russian [leaders
have for the world]{.mark}]{.underline} and especially for Europe.
Although it is possible that Trump would have bowed to Putin's vision in
a second term, [Moscow's and Washington's conflicting visions will be on
full display in the Biden years.]{.underline}

[Better [relations]{.mark} with another country [are]{.mark} never an
end in themselves but rather a means [to **promote national
interests**,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} for the
moment, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[and Russia **define theirs very
differently**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Beyond exploring new arms
control agreements to limit strategic nuclear weapons, [the bilateral
agenda for U.S.-Russian relations is likely to **remain pretty thin**
for the foreseeable future.]{.underline}

senior fellow at the Arms Control and Non-proliferation Initiative,
5/23/2022, "The Russia-Ukraine War: A Setback for Arms Control,"
<https://fsi.stanford.edu/news/russia-ukraine-war-setback-arms-control>,
RH

The Russia-Ukraine war is entering its fourth month, with no end in
sight. [[The Kremlin seems intent on]{.mark} achieving a [victory on the
**battlefield**]{.mark}]{.underline}, while [[relations]{.mark} [between
the West and Russia **plummet** to **new lows**]{.mark}. [One
**casualty**]{.mark}: U.S.-Russian **[arms control
negotiations.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Then, on February 24, 2022, the Russia launched its brutal and
unjustified invasion of Ukraine. [**[Washington]{.mark}** wound down
"business as usual" and [suspended]{.mark} the [strategic]{.mark}
stability **[dialogue]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Resumption of those discussions almost certainly will have to wait until
an end to the war, and likely for some time after that. [Arms control
[**skeptics** will]{.mark} seize on Russia's attack to [**intensify**
their opposition to any attempt to **negotiate**]{.mark} with
Moscow.]{.underline}

If U.S.-Russian discussions resume at some point, [[the **delay** will
have an **impact**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Persuading Moscow to negotiate
limits on non-strategic nuclear weapons, which would bring in a host of
complex questions]{.underline}, would have been difficult in any case.
Now, however, the sides would have little time to conclude a treaty, let
alone for the Senate to discuss ratification, before the U.S. political
season cranks up in 2024.

Setting aside the time factor, [[the]{.mark} Russia-[Ukraine war]{.mark}
almost certainly [will make it **harder** to **persuade**]{.mark}
Russian [**negotiators** to put]{.mark} non-strategic [nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} [on the table.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The Russian
military attaches]{.mark} **great [importance]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} such
[weapons]{.mark}, [seeing them as]{.mark} one [means to make up
for]{.mark} U.S. and [NATO]{.mark} **[conventional]{.mark} force**
[advantages]{.mark}]{.underline} (to say nothing about China).

Given the abysmal performance by its military against a smaller and
out-gunned foe, [[the Russian General Staff is likely to regard
its]{.mark} non-strategic **[nuclear]{.mark} [arsenal]{.mark}** [as
**more necessary**]{.mark} than ever.]{.underline}

Of particular note, [[the]{.mark} Russian [military]{.mark} [has
devoted]{.mark} significant [efforts in recent years to **adding** to
its **arsenal**]{.mark} precision-guided **conventional weapons,**
including long-range strike systems such as the Kalibr cruise
missile]{.underline}. They demonstrated some of those weapons in Syria.

[[This will make it **harder** to get]{.mark} non-strategic nuclear
weapons in the [negotiation]{.mark}]{.underline}. At a minimum, the
price that Russian negotiators will demand, such as limits on missile
defense, will increase.

[The **[Biden]{.mark}** administration thus [has **no chance**]{.mark}
[to get an]{.mark} ambitious **[agreement]{.mark}** in its first
term.]{.underline} As for a second term, who knows what the American
electorate will decide in November 2024?

[**[Arms control]{.mark}** offers a useful **national security** tool
that [can put guardrails on]{.mark} the adversarial aspects of the
**U.S.-[Russia]{.mark}n relationship**]{.underline}. As Washington and
Moscow find themselves at the most contentious point in their relations
since the early 1980s and perhaps since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis,
keeping such guardrails in place is more important than ever.
Unfortunately, [[the]{.mark} **Russia-Ukraine [war]{.mark}** [will make
doing that **more difficult** than ever]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Russia and the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited

[The Trump administration's antipathy toward arms control will strike
again on November 22, when the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[withdraws from]{.mark} the [Open Skies]{.mark} Treaty]{.underline}.
That is a mistake[. While Russia has violated the treaty, the
**[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has reciprocated]{.mark}**. [NATO
allies support the treaty]{.mark} --- which focuses first and foremost
on [enhanc]{.mark}ing [European security]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and
wish the United States to remain a party.

Whether the treaty can continue following the American departure remains
to be seen and will depend on what Russia does. When it takes office,
the Biden administration should consider reentering the agreement,
though that may require some creative international lawyering.

THE TREATY

The [[Open Skies]{.underline}]{.mark} Treaty, which entered into force
in 2002, [[permits countries to fly unarmed aircraft with
cameras]{.mark} and other sensors over the territory of the treaty's
other 34 members states.]{.underline} Based on an idea advanced by
Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, [Open Skies provides for the collection
of imagery of [military]{.mark} installations and activities in order to
**foster [transparency]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Each party to the treaty has two annual quotas: the number of flights
it may conduct over other treaty-parties (active quota), and the number
of overflights that it must accept (passive quota).]{.underline}
Aircraft are inspected before conducting an Open Skies flight, and
personnel from the country to be overflown are on board during the
flight.

The treaty offers several advantages. While the capabilities of U.S.
reconnaissance satellites are superior to those of Open Skies aircraft,
all 34 treaty-parties have access to imagery from the flights (whereas
satellite imagery is highly classified). [The treaty gives U.S. allies
and partners, who lack sophisticated imagery satellites, the opportunity
to gather confidence-building data.]{.underline} Moreover, [aircraft
offer **greater flexibility than satellites** in flight plans and can
fly under cloud cover. Open Skies flights can also be **used to send
political signals:** After Russia instigated the conflict in Donbas in
2014, for instance, the United States targeted flights at eastern
Ukraine and the bordering Russian territory in order to send a message
of U.S. support for Kyiv.]{.underline}

By 2019, the 34 parties had conducted a total of **[more than 1,500
overflights]{.underline}**. During the treaty's first 15 years of
operation, the United States conducted [196 flights over Russia and
Belarus (the two are paired for treaty purposes),]{.underline} [while
Russia conducted 71 flights over the United States.]{.underline}

Unfortunately, [[Russia has violated]{.mark} the treaty [by imposing
restrictions]{.mark} on certain flights over its territory. In response,
the United States imposed reciprocal restrictions on Russian flights
over U.S. territory.]{.underline} While the Russian violations are
problematic, [[Washington has not declared]{.mark} that they constitute
a [material breach]{.mark} --- that is, a violation that vitiates the
central purpose of the treaty]{.underline}. Nevertheless, on May 21,
Secretary of State Pompeo released a statement saying that, unless
Moscow returned to full compliance, Washington would leave the treaty in
six months' time. The U.S. government provided formal notification of
its intention to withdraw to the other treaty parties the following day;
hence, the U.S. withdrawal will take effect on November 22.

A SERIAL KILLER OF ARMS CONTROL?

By all appearances, the Trump administration sees little value in arms
control and nonproliferation arrangements. In 2018, President Trump
decided to withdraw from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
that limited Iran's nuclear capabilities. Iran can produce the fissile
material for a nuclear bomb in a much shorter time today than three
years ago. Meanwhile, the United States stands isolated, with close
allies such as Britain, France, and Germany staying in the agreement and
ignoring Washington's requests to apply sanctions on Tehran.

In 2019, [the Trump administration [withdrew from]{.mark} the 1987
[Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces]{.mark} Treaty, an agreement signed
by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev that banned an entire class of
missiles]{.underline}. [[Russia]{.mark} had
[violated]{.mark}]{.underline} the agreement by [[deploying **a**
prohibited missile]{.underline}]{.mark}, but President [[Trump]{.mark}'s
team showed **[no interest in preserving the
treaty]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [eschewing military and political
measures that [could have pressured Moscow]{.mark} to return to
compliance.]{.underline}

In 2020, administration officials reportedly considered conducting an
underground nuclear test. That would violate a long-standing test
moratorium observed by the United States, Russia, China, Britain, and
France (the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which would prohibit all
nuclear tests, has not entered into force). A U.S. nuclear test would
open the door to tests by others, eroding the nuclear knowledge
advantage the United States enjoys from having conducted more tests than
the rest of the world combined.

Happily, the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START)
appears safe. True, the Trump administration could in its final days
give notice of an intention to withdraw, but the intention could only be
carried out three months later. President-elect Biden supports New START
and supports its extension; he would revoke any such notice.

However, Open Skies looks to be the outgoing Trump administration's next
--- and last --- victim.

WHAT NEXT FOR OPEN SKIES?

The Open Skies [[Treaty]{.mark} focused on [strengthen]{.mark}ing
[confidence and security]{.mark} in Europe]{.underline}, one reason why
the Trump administration [[should have given]{.mark} the [views
of]{.mark} its [allies greater weight]{.mark}]{.underline}. A major
question now turns on what Moscow will do[, given that the U.S.
departure will mean that Russia can conduct flights over European
territory and Canada but not the United States]{.underline}.

[If Moscow decides to withdraw from Open Skies, perhaps citing the
[treaty's decreased value]{.mark} because it can no longer overfly
American territory, the treaty will collapse]{.underline}. [NATO allies
will see little point in overflying other allies or partners such as
Sweden and Finland]{.underline}. Alternatively, Moscow could decide to
remain in the treaty, at least for a time, in part to score propaganda
points over the U.S. withdrawal.

**[Solvency\-\--AT: Terror\-\--2AC]{.underline}**

**US-Russia cooperation can't solve terrorism in the Middle East --
differing tactics and barriers make them incompatible**

//smarx, AZG)

Foolish as it would be to argue that U.S. and Russian interests never
align, [[the U]{.mark}nited States in its broader battle with terrorism
**[cannot cooperate meaningfully with Moscow]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On
a practical level, [there are **[difficulties in sharing
intelligence]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[even with trusted
allies]{.underline}]{.mark}, much less in a relationship rife with
mistrust, as U.S.-Russia ties now are. More importantly, [the argument
that Moscow and Washington are fighting a common enemy]{.underline}
because both face threats from militant Islamists [is
**misleading**]{.underline}: A close look at the battles each is waging
reveals that [Russia and the U.S. are [fighting]{.mark} either different
groups or the same groups but [for **different reasons**]{.mark} and
[using **very different approaches**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Today Russia
is America\'s adversary and its actions, particularly attempts to
fracture NATO, do not align with larger U.S. security goals. Calling
Moscow a "partner" in the counterterror fight would hand it a huge PR
victory---note that the Putin-Trump call was made public by the
Kremlin---and a giant fig leaf to cover up its efforts to undermine the
U.S. on the global stage.

Obstacles to Cooperation

Sharing intelligence with foreign countries is easier said than done.
[[Practical difficulties include]{.mark} concerns about **[revealing
sources and methods]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [as well as **[strict
reg]{.mark}ulation[s]{.mark}** [involving]{.mark} access to
[info]{.mark}]{.underline}rmation [with **varying levels of
classification**]{.underline}. [Clearing these hurdles is even more
difficult in a political climate where U.S.-Russian
**military-to-military contacts are all but frozen**]{.underline} [and
the U.S. intelligence community believes]{.underline} (PDF[) Russia to
have waged "an influence campaign]{.underline} in 2016 [aimed at the
U.S. presidential election,"]{.underline} with several official
investigations underway.

Syria ostensibly would be the place to start on counterterrorism
cooperation, but [Russia has proven to be an **unreliable partner** on
matters less sensitive than intelligence sharing.]{.underline} Earlier
this year, the U.S.-led coalition said Russian military officials had
rejected a coalition request for permission to strike Islamic State
targets near a strategically important garrison at al-Tanf, which is
used by U.S. troops. [[The Pentagon]{.mark} has [**repeatedly
complained** of **dangerous maneuvers**]{.mark} by Russia]{.underline}n
fighter jets, most recently in December. And U.N. investigators say
there is strong evidence suggesting that [[the Russian-brokered]{.mark}
2013 [deal to rid Syria]{.mark} of its chemical weapons [did not
work]{.mark}]{.underline}, while Moscow has blocked related
investigations from continuing. There are also reports that "the
Kremlin\'s diplomatic coordination with the United States is much less
intense" under the Trump administration than under Barack Obama\'s.

[[It]{.underline}]{.mark} also [**[remains unclear]{.mark}** exactly
[what Russia could provide]{.mark} to the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [of value in terms of intelligence or military
capabilities]{.underline}. [The U.S. is **doing a better job** battling
Islamic State than Russia is. In areas [where Russian]{.mark}-backed
[forces operate,]{.mark} IS [fighters]{.mark} **regularly manage to
[move freely]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially around the middle
Euphrates River valley, according to U.S. officials. Moreover, [despite
Putin\'s declaration of "victory]{.underline}" in December,
[[Russia\'s]{.mark} main military [facilities]{.mark} in Syria [were
**attacked**]{.mark} in January]{.underline}---first with mortars
killing two servicemen and then with a dozen armed drones, possibly from
territory covered by a Moscow-brokered cease-fire---[**[demonstrating
the]{.mark} Russian forces\' [vulnerability]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Overall, [despite Moscow\'s growing influence in [the Middle
East,]{.mark}]{.underline} [the region [is]{.mark} still [not]{.mark}
one [where Russia has]{.mark} more **[knowledge or sway]{.mark}** than
Washington]{.underline}.

The \'Common Enemy\' Fallacy

[The primary reason U.S.-Russian counterterrorism cooperation is even
under discussion is because of the idea that the two countries are
fighting a common enemy]{.underline}---jihadist groups in general, and
Islamic State in particular. In reality, [Moscow\'s and Washington\'s
respective [wars on terror **differ**]{.mark}
**significantly**]{.underline} [[in motives]{.mark}, aims,
[targets,]{.mark} tactics and [strategies, and]{.mark} even [who the
enemy is,]{.mark} which further dims any prospects for
cooperation]{.underline}.

In Syria, for example, [the U.S. wants to defeat the Islamic State
because it is an **engine of international terrorism**]{.underline},
while [Russia fights]{.underline} the group mainly [because it is an
enemy of President Bashar al-Assad]{.underline}---whose regime Moscow
has saved from collapse. Meanwhile, [[Russian]{.mark} special
[forces]{.mark} and warplanes [serve as a **force multiplier** for
Hezbollah]{.mark}, a recognized terror group]{.underline}. [Differences
like these explain]{.underline} in large part [why [U.S.-Russian
cooperation in Syria has been]{.mark} **limited to ["deconfliction" and
avoiding accidents]{.mark}**]{.underline}, while the two sides\'
definitions of the terrorist threat continue to diverge.

[[Another key difference in]{.underline}]{.mark} the two countries\'
[[threat perceptions]{.mark} is]{.underline} that [[Moscow]{.mark} has
long [had to fight]{.mark} Islamist terrorism **[in its
backyard]{.mark}**]{.underline}, while [the U.S. has been doing battle
in **distant lands**]{.underline}. In the mid- to late-1990s, [myriad
anti-Russian rebel groups,]{.underline} primarily from the traditionally
Muslim North Caucasus region, [adopted religious ideologies]{.underline}
instead of secular separatist aspirations---a shift attributed by many
scholars to the growing influence of foreign fighters from the Middle
East and Central Asia. [Since then, Islamic militants have launched many
high-profile attacks on Russian soil]{.underline} far beyond the
battlefields of the Caucasus. [These have included targeted
destruction]{.underline} of transportation infrastructure and
meticulously planned operations specifically designed to kill civilians
and spread terror throughout the population, such as the Moscow theater
hostage crisis in 2002 and the Beslan school siege in 2004. [The U.S.
has suffered far fewer attacks by jihadists on its home turf and has
been fighting largely to keep them away]{.underline} from its shores
[and to help protect allies]{.underline} in Europe.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} difference, too, [**[calls for different
approaches to counterterrorism]{.underline}**:]{.mark} [Expeditionary
counterterrorism requires a **significant deployment of military
force**, while domestic counterterrorism can rely more on **local and
federal police** and an array of intelligence agencies.]{.underline}

[The U.S. and Russia also **differ markedly** in their approaches to
fighting terrorism and [it is **hard to imagine** how these could
be]{.mark} made **[compatible.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Roughly put, [[the
U.S.]{.mark} aims to espouse a comprehensive approach that **[tries to
win hearts]{.mark}**]{.underline} and minds by finding out about
communities\' grievances and factoring in socioeconomic development;
[[Russia does not]{.mark} explicitly try to do this]{.underline}[,
[relying]{.underline}]{.mark} [instead [on]{.mark} **heavy-handed
methods**]{.underline}, [many]{.underline} of which [the U.S. military
could not easily get away with and in fact condemns.]{.underline}

[These]{.underline} have [included **[indiscriminate
bombing]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [forced disappearances whose victims got
no legal representation, were held incommunicado]{.underline} and were
sometimes never heard from again; and [collective
punishment]{.underline}, including the [targeting]{.underline} of
[suspected insurgents\' families, friends and neighbors]{.underline}.
[[Russia\'s focus has been]{.mark} **largely kinetic**]{.underline}, as
[the military has **relied on a decapitation strategy**]{.underline} [to
eliminate successive high-ranking]{.underline} insurgent military
[commanders]{.underline} over the years. [This approach]{.underline} has
been quite effective in the short term, but also [may be myopic,
[trading]{.mark}]{.underline} (PDF) [[long]{.mark}er-[term stability for
short-lived security]{.mark}]{.underline}: [Insurgents\']{.underline}
social, political and [economic grievances have]{.underline} largely
[been ignored]{.underline}, practically [ensuring that future
generations of militants will pick up the mantle of jihad]{.underline}.
In Chechnya, for example, [anti-Moscow militants have been all but wiped
out under a ruthless, Moscow-backed strongman]{.underline}, but the
insurgency has shifted to neighboring Dagestan. Indeed, thousands (PDF)
of [[Russia]{.mark}n fighters have **[gone to wage jihad]{.mark}** in
Syria and Iraq]{.underline} and experts are just beginning to assess the
threats they will pose in years to come.

[In an ideal world Russia and the U.S. would be able to cooperate
against jihadist organizations]{.underline}, jointly developing
counterterrorist best practices, [but]{.underline} for all the reasons
listed above [**this is not realistic** at present.]{.underline}

extension of a law adopted in July, which prohibited these
aforementioned actions but did not mention punitive measures. Before
this, in 2014, public statements containing "false information" about
the USSR's wartime actions or Soviet veterans were criminalised.
An amendment to the country's criminal code imposed large fines or up to
five years imprisonment.

Such [legal amendments are yet another phase in the ongoing consecration
of Soviet victory in the "Great Patriotic War]{.underline}". The victory
is now the principal element in Russia's memory politics, with
corresponding [ideology used to legitimise **militarism** and **great
power ambitions**]{.underline}. These recent developments are not just
another step towards the country's revival of Soviet propaganda
narratives. [They are also intertwined with the Russian aggression in
Ukraine]{.underline} and some of the most tragic events of the ongoing
war. These changes once again demonstrate what can happen when
governments attempt to deny historical crimes through the use of
ideology.

At the same time, this is not very surprising. This became especially
clear to me after receiving a Visegrad Scholarship to study some of the
roots of current Russian policy at the Central European University and
Open Society Archives (OSA) in Budapest.

The OSA collection comprises communist propaganda materials from the
Stalin era to the 1980s, the findings of Ray J. Madden's US Congress
committee on the Katyń massacre, Polish samizdat and émigré press, a
number of western publications, Soviet publications from the late 1980s,
and other materials. Overall, [ƒ]{.underline}. Moscow originally denied
responsibility for the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and its consequences,
such as the partition of Poland, the annexation of Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania, and the Katyń massacre. The state would only formally admit
its guilt in the Gorbachev era.

A new national myth

However, [a revival of some Soviet narratives began a few years later
under the pretext of fighting against the "falsification of
history]{.underline}". In May 2009, Moscow established the Presidential
Commission of the Russian Federation to Counter Attempts to Falsify
History to the Detriment of Russia's Interests. The then head of the
president's staff, Sergei Naryshkin, was appointed chairman of the
commission. Since 2016, Naryshkin has been the director of the Foreign
Intelligence Service. He recently made international headlines following
an infamous session of Russia's Security Council on February 21st.
During this meeting, he proposed the recognition of the so-called
"Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics" and was ridiculed by Putin.

Soon after the commission's creation, historian Boris
Sokolov predicted rather accurately that [its activities would result in
efforts to suppress information about the Soviet occupation and
annexation of the Baltic states]{.underline}, as well as other crimes
committed by the Soviet regime. He also highlighted the existence of an
official Soviet foreign ministry memorandum published in 1948. This
document was released in response to the publication of the
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact's secret protocols in [the US and was titled
"Falsifiers of History]{.underline}". The memorandum, which would
provide the basis for Soviet propaganda over the next few decades,
[denied the existence of the secret protocols and stated that Moscow's
pre-war attempts to form a collective security framework had been
undermined by Great Britain and France]{.underline}. As a result, the
USSR was compelled to accept the pact in order to win more time to
better prepare for an unavoidable war with Germany.

[It has also been noted that a gradual return to a **Stalinist
interpretation of history** began]{.underline}, at least in education,
right [at the start of Putin's rule]{.underline}. History textbooks
published in Russia in the 1990s admitted that the USSR's territorial
gains in 1939-40 happened against the will of the peoples of the Baltic
states and Eastern Poland (most of the authors avoided the term
"annexation", likely because it would imply similarities between Stalin
and Hitler's interests and methods). By 2003, however, any mention of
the secret protocols was removed from new textbooks. Since 2007, the
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact has been explained in favourable terms, while
Stalin has become revered as an "effective manager".

Soon after the formation of the "falsification of history" commission,
the head of the Russian Defence Ministry's Institute of Military
History, Sergei Kovalev, published an article on the ministry's website.
This asserted that Poland had been responsible for beginning the Second
World War, as it had declined "justified" German demands. Meanwhile, the
USSR needed a non-aggression pact with [Germany and had deployed troops
in the Baltic states in order to improve border security]{.underline}.
The article was deleted from the website the next day and it was
explained that it just represented Kovalev's personal opinion. However,
arguments in favour of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and assertions about
Poland's responsibility for the beginning of the war would be repeated
later -- at a much higher level.

One significant example of the outcomes produced by the commission is a
book published in 2011 by State Duma member Vladimir Medinsky, who would
later continue developing the state's new ideology as minister of
culture. In The War: The Myths of the USSR, 1939-1945, Medinsky
justified the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact using familiar Soviet arguments.
He denied that the USSR was responsible for the Katyń massacre, and so
forth. Medinsky implied that the European Union was to blame for
statements that Stalin had been responsible for the beginning of war,
along with Hitler. A rather characteristic favourable review of
Medinsky's book stated that "Almost everything that liberal journalists
write about nowadays was invented long ago by Dr. Goebbels."

Perhaps most significantly, [the change of rhetoric could be observed in
Putin's statements]{.underline}. While during a visit to Poland in 2009
he had denounced the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact as "collusion to solve
one's problems at others' expense", in 2015 he defended it at a joint
press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all the while
blaming western nations. This falls in line with the old Soviet argument
about Great Britain and France's unwillingness to support a collective
security framework. Later on, Putin increasingly appeared obsessed with
keeping the Soviet version of history intact. At a Commonwealth of
Independent States summit in December 2019, he lectured his
counterparts on the causes and events of the Second World War. He made
numerous allusions to Soviet propaganda, including speculation on the
"Munich Betrayal" in an attempt to exonerate the USSR and put the blame
on Great Britain, France and Poland. The extent of Putin's argument led
to a reply from Warsaw's foreign ministry, which highlighted the Soviet
Union's invasion, occupation, deportations and mass killings. This
document also proposed relaunching the Polish-Russian Group for
Difficult Issues that had operated in the 1990s. Another statement on
the issue was later made by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.

In June 2020, Putin expanded on his historical argument in a
lengthy article in The National Interest. Among other issues, the piece
implied that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the USSR's actions had been
justified, as the "Munich Betrayal" had meant that the West would deal
with security issues without taking Soviet interests into account. He
also claimed that the USSR entered the war only when it had been
attacked by Germany and praised the Red Army's "liberation mission in
Europe". The Russian leader also defended the post-war division of
Europe by referring, even though indirectly, to the Yalta Conference
agreements. Most absurdly, [the Russian embassy in
Berlin [sent](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-baffles-german-historians-with-request-they-supplement-lectures-with-an-article-by-putin/30690752.html) a
translation of the **revisionist article**]{.underline} to a number of
German professors, asking them to make use of the work in their
lectures.

[Vladimir Putin wants not only to seize new territories, but to own
history]{.underline}. History often falls victim to autocracies and
dictatorships. [Reshaped historical narratives become compelling
explanations of all-powerful leaders and serve]{.underline} their
**[propaganda]{.underline}** as one of the instruments to preserve and
increase their political weight.

No wonder that Russian President Vladimir Putin comes up with absurdly
manipulated historical facts to push his geopolitical policies. But [it
is more than just lies or manipulation. It is a well-grounded philosophy
that]{.underline} not only **[revises the past]{.underline}**, but also
becomes his instrument to reshape the present.

Isn't that what Putin does when he plays the "independent republics"
card, with which the post-Soviet space that emerged 30 years ago is
generously dotted by his bloody will: South Ossetia in Georgia,
Moscow-created Luhansk and Donetsk people's republics in Ukraine and the
breakaway Transnistria republic in Moldova -- God knows how many more
such black holes the Kremlin leadership can create with the help of
mercenaries and propaganda.

[Putin is **offended** by the collapse of the Soviet Union]{.underline}.
His love for that bygone era is actively cultivated in Russia even 30
years after its implosion. [Putin manipulates the notion of democracy by
comparing artificially created pseudo-states with the real ones that
constituted the USSR]{.underline}. He may indeed not see the difference
between Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Georgia and the conjured
formations of LPR, DPR, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, or Transnistria. In
this way, [Putin suspends the understanding of freedom as a hostage to
his biggest political intrigue -- the confrontation between the West and
Russia]{.underline}.

According to this primitive formula, if the U.S. once divided the USSR
into some 15 republics, [why can't Russia today break those republics
into smaller ones]{.underline}?

Having amassed nearly 200,000 troops with weapons and military equipment
around Ukraine's southeastern borders, Putin refuses to directly talk
with the political leadership in Kyiv. Literally, he ignores any attempt
at dialogue and sends messages through European interlocutors. This
seems to be his response to the Ukrainian leadership's unwillingness to
negotiate with the Russian installed puppets whose Moscow-armed
formations have been fighting in Ukraine's two easternmost regions of
Luhansk and Donets for nearly eight years.

The parallels are blustering, but quite possible for a man offended by
the historical collapse of the state he seems to consider his homeland,
the USSR, and who is already personally expressing doubts about
Ukraine's sovereignty. "I am convinced that [Ukraine's true sovereignty
is possible precisely in partnership with Russia]{.underline}," Putin
wrote in a diatribe in July 2021.

[Putin acts as if he really sees no difference between the sovereign
state of Ukraine and the quasi-republics that are under his own military
control]{.underline}. It is as if the Russian leader is trying to teach
the world a lesson by creating imitations and empty simulacra on copies
of real historical facts.

Putin's version of history distorts understandable values to help manage
his own country. If you don't know how to create, then "protect" and
take away. Russia's hybrid or covert invasions of Ukraine's Crimean
Peninsula and Georgia's Abkhazia, and Moldova's Transnistria province
under the guise of "protection" was done against phantom enemies he
conjured.

Isn't this what happened to the Soviet Union? While the West was
recovering from World War II, building democracy and competitive market
economies, the USSR was building tanks to defend itself and intimidating
its own people with U.S. aggression. A Ukrainian diplomat who survived
Stalin's death as a child recounted how his entire family stayed awake,
gazing up into the night sky. "We waited that every second we could see
American missiles that were going to destroy us," he recalled vividly
for the rest of his life.

[The Soviet Union, in fact, was built on falsehoods, **lies**, and
**unrealistic, artificial ideals**. Putin is deliberately repeating this
failed scheme and therefore risks his empire falling just as
loudly.]{.underline}

**Russia is revisionist \-\-- it is transparent in its intentions to

On the assumptions that changing the status quo is the basic aim of a
revisionist strategy (Buzan, 2008) and that acceptance of the risks
involved in the use of force is a key factor in distinguishing the
different forms of revisionism (Schweller, 2015), this study puts
forward a new typology of revisionism. The six types identified are
based on three dimensions: the means employed (peaceful/violent), the
nature of the objectives (territory/norms/power), and the level of
action (regional/global). The introduction of a new typology of
revisionism can also stimulate further research on the possible change
of goals, means, and level of action of the potential claims of the
revisionist powers that have economic and military capabilities to act
both regionally and globally to change the status quo (see the case of
Russia, China and, according to some scholars, the United States).
Further research insights can be derived from the application of
normative revisionism to the various empirical cases (see the Arab
countries and the developing). Our [empirical analysis]{.underline}, in
particular, [confirms the importance of the level of action as a new
element]{.underline} with respect to previous typologies and [makes it
possible not only to demonstrate the central part played by the military
option in Russian strategy inside and outside the post-Soviet space but
also and above all to confirm the escalation of the revisionist
objectives pursued both at the regional level]{.underline} with the
interventions in Georgia and Ukraine, [and]{.underline} at [the global
level]{.underline} with the intervention in Syria. The respectively
nationalist (Georgia and Ukraine) and radical (Syria) nature of the
interventions emerges in relation both to the means and the level of
action of these interventions, and to the objectives. In Georgia and
Ukraine, Russia obtained the control and/or annexation of territories
like South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and Crimea, strengthened its position with
respect to neighbouring countries, and impeded the expansion of NATO and
the EU. In Syria it obtained control of the port of Tartus, ended the
American monopoly in the war on terrorism by asserting itself as a
strong party to the peace negotiations, challenged American interests in
the Middle East by strengthening the Assad regime, and clearly
manifested its determination to halt the decline that set in after 1989.
[The dual nature of Russia's objectives]{.underline} -- both territorial
(annexation and/or control over certain areas) and political
(improvement of power and prestige at the regional and global levels) --
[characterized the country's **revisionist strategy** as a
whole]{.underline} from August 2008 to March 2016, [confirming the
importance of the gradual increase in military expenditure and the
reforms]{.underline} of the SAP in pursuit of the same. If the spectre
of the 'end of history' that hovered over the ashes of communism was
swept away by Putin at the end of the 1990s and [the impact that his
long period in power has had on domestic and regional balances is
**unquestionable**,]{.underline} what is instead still in need of
discussion is [the effect that his plan of radical revisionism has had
on the configuration of the international system]{.underline} as a 102
Barbara Pisciotta Published online by Cambridge University Press whole.
As matters now stand, any talk of American decline at the military level
is misleading and empirically incorrect. It is, however, [necessary to
take the readiness to use military force as our starting point if we are
to understand the nature and the consequences of Russian revisionism at
the global level]{.underline}. A power in a position of hegemony cannot
in fact hesitate to use all of the diplomatic, economic, and military
means at its disposal in order to preserve its status and prevent any
destabilizing threats from calling it into question. The USA has made
systematic use of force since 1989 to preserve its spheres of influence
all over the world and eliminate threats (from figures like Milosevic,
Saddam Hussein, and Qaddafi) to the stability of the liberal world order
on which its indisputable supremacy rested. Where it intervened
militarily, with or without a resolution of the UN Security Council, [it
told the rest of the world that it was the only actor authorized -- or
rather self-authorized -- to intervene in defence,]{.underline} at least
formally, of human rights at the expense of national sovereignty.
[Russia's revisionism is the child of this strategy]{.underline}. In
order to alter the status quo in its favour, [Putin has]{.underline}
operated on at both the regional and the global levels to oppose
American expansion in the post-Soviet space and its version of
humanitarian intervention all over the world, not hesitating to use
force in order to challenge the United States [openly]{.underline} and
[bend the international rules to Russia's advantage]{.underline}. At the
regional level, Georgia and Ukraine have been blocked. Their entry into
the EU and NATO will not be possible without Russian consent or the risk
of a frontal clash with Moscow. At the global level, the effects of
Russia's strategy will have to be assessed in the medium and long terms.
[Russia has now revealed its intentions and explicitly threatened the
US]{.underline} monopoly in Syria both in words and in deeds. [It is
clearly not enough for Russia to **alter the hierarchy of power**. It
wants to obtain acknowledgement of its **prestige** as a great power in
both diplomatic and military terms.]{.underline} In other words, [Russia
wants to play a decision-making part once again]{.underline} in the
management of world affairs. It also wants a less centralized system
offering the opportunity to regain important margins of power.

The rise of digital diplomacy has provided state actors new venues to
promote their national interests. Twitter specifically has emerged as a
"megaphone and substantive communications medium"\[1\] for heads of
state, governmental institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs),
and scholars. [The Russian Federation has exploited the growing
importance of social media platforms to diplomacy in order to seek
legitimization and normalization]{.underline} of its 2014 annexation of
Crimea, which is recognized almost universally as Ukrainian
territory.\[2\] Despite a robust digital campaign, the percentage of
Ukrainians that believe Crimea is Russian territory has actually
decreased since 2014. Furthermore, Russia's social media activity has
not strengthened its claim to Crimea, but it does provide insight into
how the state uses emerging technologies below the threshold of war to
meet strategic objectives.

Background

When the Soviet Union collapsed, Ukraine found itself in possession of
the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world. Encouraged by both the
United States and Russia, Ukraine forewent the arsenal for international
security guarantees protecting its independence and territorial
sovereignty, as outlined in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum.\[3\] In 2014,
Russia breached these security guarantees by invading and annexing the
Crimean Peninsula after the ousting of Ukrainian President Viktor
Yanukovych during the Revolution of Dignity (known internationally as
the Euromaidan Revolution). The annexation was swiftly condemned,\[4\]
with world leaders pointing to international law as the foundation of
their argument against a perceived act of aggression. Russian President
Vladimir Putin responded that the security guarantees made in the early
1990s were only valid with the pre-revolution Ukrainian government,
insinuating that the post-Euromaidan government was leading a "new"\[5\]
state, and that the Russian military had an obligation to protect ethnic
Russians from the "nationalist junta"\[6\] in Kyiv. With most of the
international community rejecting these justifications, [Russia launched
a **revisionist information campaign** to legitimize
occupation]{.underline} of the peninsula.

[Increased use of social media has led to a **proliferation** of
**historical revisionism** and reframing of current events, though the
Kremlin is not a rookie when it comes to contorting the narrative around
its behavior]{.underline}. For example, Moscow has long attempted to
erase the Red Army's mass murder of nearly 22,000 Polish soldiers in
1943 in Katyn, Russia by focusing conversations on the destruction of
the Belorussian village, Khatyn, by occupying Nazi forces.\[7\] It
wasn't until 1990 that the Soviets admitted the Red Army was
"responsible for the murders,"\[8\] despite Kremlin-sponsored social
media accounts, such as the Russian Mission to the EU account
(@RusMission_EU) denying this fact as recently as May 2020.\[9\] Russia
utilizes internet trolls,\[10\] bots,\[11\] and state-affiliated social
media accounts to shape narratives by targeting naïve social media users
who either inadvertently perpetuate falsehoods or rely on an extreme
form of confirmation bias\[12\] in which they only receive and re-share
content they agree with.

Russia's Digital Activity

In recent years, Russia has honed its social media tactics alongside a
contingency of its other information warfare practices. [Russia's
**information warfare** against Ukraine]{.underline} was described in
2014 by U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove as the "[most amazing
information warfare blitzkrieg]{.underline}."\[13\] Social media plays a
significant role in the Russian information warfare strategy as it
provides "cheap, efficient, and highly effective access"\[14\] to
audiences while maintaining plausible deniability for the Kremlin. The
conditions of the social media environment---sense of anonymity, reach,
and speed---provide unique challenges to combating information campaigns
on such platforms. Social media platforms allow trolls and bots to
congregate with real individuals that can be separated into three
categories: (1) "useful idiots," who unknowingly give credibility to
Russian propaganda and objectives; (2) "fellow travelers," who are
Russian and Kremlin sympathizers, and; (3) "agent provocateurs," who are
actively being manipulated by the Russian government.\[15\]
Collectively, these individuals and accounts provide ample ground for
the Kremlin to engage in narrative-shaping and other disinformation
campaigns.

Twitter and other social media present opportunities to the Russian
government to [export its historical and **political narratives** to
both foreign governments and private citizens in every corner of the
world]{.underline}. Those not privy to Ukrainian-Russian relations,
international law, or the underlying forces of the 2014 Revolution of
Dignity may be more susceptible to Russian propaganda that "Crimea is
Russia" and that Russia invaded to "protect Crimea" from the
"nationalist junta" that is the post-Euromaidan government.\[16\] These
individuals may promote these views, providing attention to Russia's
stance, further legitimizing and normalizing it. Furthermore, such
attention confirms the biases of pro-Russia activists who seek
validation of their views online.\[17\] Political pundits may also
accidentally or purposefully contribute to this bias. A November 2019
clip\[18\] of American political commentator Tucker Carlson asking, "Why
shouldn't I root for Russia? And I am," regarding the ongoing war in
eastern Ukraine went viral and was largely met with condemnation from a
variety of Twitter users. Carlson in this instance was a "useful
idiot,"\[19\] and the confidence his comment might provide to pro-Russia
activists, while difficult to quantify, should be considered.

[Nor is Russia likely to stop there. Spreading instability is a central
tenet of]{.underline} Vladimir [Putin's **hybrid warfare
doctrine**]{.underline}, and there is every reason to believe this
includes creating greater turbulence in Europe. The Russian president
has recently called the borders of all the former Soviet republics into
question, [[claiming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNEb9VZvzw&feature=youtu.be) that
numerous unspecified republics left the USSR while in possession of
"historically Russian lands]{.underline}." [This]{.underline} thinly
veiled [threat is not limited to Ukraine, Belarus, or
Kazakhstan]{.underline}. It also applies to the three Baltic nations,
which are all EU and NATO member states.

[Putin underlined his]{.underline} ominously [imperial
thinking]{.underline} towards the Baltic states in a June
2020 [article](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/vladimir-putin-real-lessons-75th-anniversary-world-war-ii-162982) for
The National Interest that allowed the Russian ruler to share his
profoundly unapologetic view of Soviet conduct during WWII. He described
the 1940 invasion and annexation of the Baltic states as "the
incorporation of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia," before going on go
claim, "their accession to the USSR was implemented on a contractual
basis, with the consent of the elected authorities." [Comments of this
nature expose the grim reality of **Putin's revisionist
worldview**]{.underline}, [regardless of]{.underline} the [wishful
thinking]{.underline} that many of Ukraine's partners would prefer to
believe.

This raises a number of important questions. To what degree is the West
aware of the challenge it faces? Does the West recognize that spreading
turbulence closer to the heart of Europe is part and parcel of Russia's
strategy? Should Europe help to create a fault line that runs from the
Baltic States to the Black Sea? This is no metaphor, nor is it an
exaggeration.

[The experience of recent years should already have been sufficient to
convince Western leaders that appeasement is not an effective way to
address the security challenges presented by Putin's
Russia]{.underline}. Failure to confront the Kremlin in Crimea in early
2014 [has only encouraged greater **Russian boldness**]{.underline}.
Moscow has expanded its military presence everywhere from Syria to
Libya, while at the same time broadening the scope of its hybrid war
operations throughout North America, the European Union and beyond.

With examples of Russian aggression increasing in the international
arena, the Western world must decide where to draw the line. Ukraine
faces no such dilemmas -- the country is committed to defending every
inch of its territory, even if that means doing so alone. Western
leaders can either commit to helping Ukraine defend itself, or face the
consequences on their own territory in the near future.

At present, [the Western world seems unsure of how best to contain a
resurgent and revisionist Russia]{.underline}. As the front line nation
in the current confrontation, [Ukraine is the most obvious focus for
containment strategies]{.underline}. In practical terms, this means
revisiting the Minsk Process and adapting the framework of the current
dialogue to reflect geopolitical realities. Now is not the time to cling
dogmatically to existing arrangements. On the contrary, [creative
approaches are required in order to safeguard global security and
prevent further European destabilization.]{.underline}

As well as supporting a pragmatic approach to implementation of the
Minsk Agreements, [Western leaders should also revisit the role and
functions of]{.underline} the international [security
institutions]{.underline} involved in the Ukraine peace process. For
example, the OSCE has never deployed peacekeepers on a large scale to
neutralize a conflict. The time may now be ripe for such a move. We are
fully aware of the gravity of the challenge, but a successful outcome
would be significant for the entire continent. This would require real
leadership and could be a special task for Sweden, which will chair the
OSCE in 2021.

If the usual coalitions do not work, we in Ukraine should think about
creating new ones and attracting new allies.

The search for new models across various international platforms should
be coupled with expanded bilateral cooperation between Ukraine and all
countries invested in restoring peace in Europe and preserving it for
the wider world. Ukraine has recently progressed to the next stage in
its relations with NATO. We are ready to affirm Ukraine's new Enhanced
Opportunity
Partner [status](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/nato-upgrades-ukraine/) in
collective as well as bilateral security models. This could mean
recognizing Ukraine as a Major Non-NATO Ally, for example.

[The deteriorating international security]{.underline} climate since
2014 [is testament to the failure of the present policies towards a
**revisionist** Russia. There is]{.underline} evidently [a need to
identify]{.underline} and implement new [models that can ensure peace
and contain the Kremlin]{.underline}. The most pragmatic approach to
this challenge lies in greater support for Ukrainian sovereignty and
territorial integrity via the modification of the failing Minsk Process.
Further delays will only lead to additional costs.

collapse of the Soviet Union as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of
the 20th century. Two years later,
Putin [bemoaned](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/24034) the
aftermath of the Soviet era and the pernicious, unipolar world---one led
not by Moscow, but by Washington---that it had created. Last year, in
perhaps the clearest articulation of his worldview, Putin said that
Ukrainians and Russians are "[one people---a single
whole](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67843)." On Monday, he
took that sentiment even further, [declaring Ukraine to be "an
**inalienable** part of our own history, culture, and spiritual space"
whose independence was]{.underline} a product not of self-determination
(Ukrainians resoundingly voted in favor of independence from the Soviet
Union in a [1991
referendum](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/25-years-independence-the-ukrainian-referendum)),
but rather ["a **mistake**]{.underline}."

Unlike his [2014
address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l10BsQzOGKM) announcing
Moscow's annexation of Crimea, which was largely framed as a moment of
celebration, this was an angry speech---one ostensibly designed to make
Russia's people angry too, and to justify what was to come. "In
territories adjacent to Russia, which I have to note is our historical
land, a hostile 'anti-Russia' is taking shape," Putin said in another
address ahead of the invasion. "For our country, it is a matter of life
and death, a matter of our historical future as a nation."

It's hard to know what Putin means by historical future (which is, on
its face, an oxymoron), though we can take an educated guess. When Putin
speaks of Russia today, [he speaks of a country whose greatness is
defined by its past]{.underline}---namely, [its **imperial
history**]{.underline} and its victory during World War II---which he
believes [must guide its present]{.underline}. "Putin weaponized history
by giving it a function," Orysia Lutsevych, the head of the Ukraine
Forum at the London-based Chatham House think tank, told me. As far as
the Russian president is concerned, "history is the fortune teller of
the future."

Such [historical narratives can]{.underline} be
[compel]{.underline}ling, especially when they elicit [the kind of
**nostalgic nationalism**]{.underline} that has proved potent elsewhere,
including in the United States (where Donald Trump's Republican Party
has dubbed itself the defender of ["patriotic
education"](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/us/politics/trump-patriotic-education.html)),
India (where Hindu nationalists have appealed to pride in India's past
to undermine its secular present), and Hungary (where Prime Minister
Viktor Orbán
often [invokes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/03/how-viktor-orban-turned-century-hungarian-history-into-secret-weapon/) the
territories the country lost after the First World War). "Putin is not
the only person who is old enough to have felt that sense of deep,
personalized humiliation and shame that came with the loss of power of
the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War," Keir Giles, the author
of [​​Moscow Rules: What Drives Russia to Confront the
West](https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780815735748), told me. "Anything
that [reasserts Russia as that great power with a greater status than
others and the right to a global presence and global influence in
others' affairs]{.underline} will be popular in those sectors of the
Russian population."

Still, it's difficult to gauge just how big that sector is or how
pervasive the narrative has been among those who don't share Putin's
semi-mythological view of history. A recent [CNN
poll](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2022/02/europe/russia-ukraine-crisis-poll-intl/),
published the day before the start of Moscow's military invasion of
Ukraine, found that though roughly half of Russians support using
military force to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, only 36 percent
support doing so as a means of forcing a reunification of the two
countries. The lack of support for the latter was most clearly evidenced
by [anti-war
protests](https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2022/02/photos-anti-war-protests-russia/622914/) that
have broken out across Russian cities.

When I spoke with Denis Volkov, the director of the Moscow-based Levada
Center, Russia's last independent pollster, in early February, he told
me that though the majority of Russians fear war, few would feel
comfortable voicing opposition to it if it came due to fear of
reprisals. Indeed, more than [1,700
arrests](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/we-dont-want-this-russians-react-to-the-ukraine-invasion?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Othe) have
already been made. Besides, Volkov said, "public opinion will be no
limit to the Russian government."

Though Putin may feel obliged to justify his war of choice to the
Russian people, who with Ukrainians will share the costs of a bloody and
drawn-out conflict, [his revisionist history is designed to
appeal]{.underline} to no one more so than himself. By restoring
Russia's control over its former territories, [Putin not only corrects
what he sees as a historic wrong but also cements his place in Russian
history as the leader who restored the country to its rightful
status.]{.underline}

The irony is that in his quest to make Russia great again, he risks
achieving just the opposite. Invading Ukraine has already resulted
in [wide-ranging
sanctions](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/sanctions-against-russia-at-a-glance-people-organisations-uk-us-eu) and
has all but ensured Russia's diplomatic isolation. Even Putin's friends
in Europe, such
as [Orbán](https://twitter.com/zoltanspox/status/1497099482965721103?s=20&t=imIB8HpI9TF87fiiLNyf0g) and
Czech President [Milos
Zeman](https://www.reuters.com/business/czech-president-russia-should-be-cut-off-swift-2022-02-24/),
have gone out of their way to reiterate their support for Ukraine and
their commitment to a joint European Union stance.

"Putin's views have become more and more extreme over time to the point
where they are now more or less unrecognizable and have few points of
contact with history as it's understood in the outside world," Giles
said. "He's operating in a different plane of reality and in a different
century."

**Ukraine proves \-\-- revisionism motivates invasion**

history\' in Victory Day speech,\" Republic World,

[White House has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of presenting
a version of revisionist history in his Victory Day speech]{.underline}.
As Putin used the occasion of Soviet victory to defend his Special
Military Operation on Ukraine, US Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that
[his words distorted facts]{.underline}. On Monday, the Russian Czar
addressed his countrymen from Red Square in Moscow but refrained from
announcing victory over Ukraine. 

Following the same, Psaki said, "But what I will say is that what we saw
[President Putin]{.underline} do is [give a version of revisionist
history that took the form of disinformation that we have seen too
commonly as the Russian playbook]{.underline}." 

"You know, our view is that we should remember --- and this is why I did
this at the top --- what this day is actually about, which is something
that we have all celebrated, which is the defeat of Nazis in --- after
World War Two, something that Russians have celebrated in the streets
for many years,\" she added. 

\'Patently False\' 

In his speech, [Putin blamed the West for triggering the ongoing
conflict in Ukraine and said that NATO threatened the security
of]{.underline} the [Russia]{.underline}n Federation. \"Russia called on
the West for an honest dialogue, to search for reasonable, compromise
solutions, to take into account each other\'s interests. All in vain.
The NATO countries did not want to hear us, which means that they had
completely different plans. The danger grew every day. Russia gave a
pre-emptive rebuff to aggression. It was a forced, timely, and the only
right decision. The decision of a sovereign, strong, independent
country,\" [Putin]{.underline} said. However, Psaki said that hi[s claim
was "absurd" and "patently false."]{.underline} 

On the other hand, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelsnkyy vowed to
defeat Russia on Monday. He said, \"Very soon there will be two Victory
Days in Ukraine and someone will not have any.\" Marching on Khreschatyk
Street in the country\'s capital Kyiv, he spoke about two victory days
referring to triumph in world war II as well as Ukraine\'s victory in
the ongoing war. The embattled leader said that his countrymen will win
the war because they are fighting for their children. "We won then. We
will win now. And Khreshchatyk will see the victory parade -- the
Victory of Ukraine!" he claimed.   

**[Yes Revisionism\-\--Revanchist\-\--1AR]{.underline}**

**Russian tendencies are revisionist and revanchist \-\-- it threatens
the entire LIO**

**Balachandran, 22** (Gopalan Balachandran, Co-director, Albert Hirshman

3-7-22, 'Revisionism, Revanchism, and the War in Ukraine', Geneva

/ alundy)

This is a somber moment for all of us. The Albert Hirschman Centre on
Democracy, like everyone else in this room, is committed to a just,
democratic, inclusive, and rules-based international order. This order
is now beset by fresh and dangerous uncertainties. In co-hosting [this
event](https://www.graduateinstitute.ch/communications/news/town-hall-war-ukraine) we
would like to underscore the importance of this commitment as we try to
grapple with the dangerous uncertainties caused by Russia's unjustified
and brutal invasion of Ukraine.

[Russia has been a revisionist power since the 1990s]{.underline}. Its
[invasion of Ukraine could be a signal that it is now embarked on a
dangerously revanchist project]{.underline}. Time alone will tell how
this revanchist tendency might unfold. [A revanchist war in Ukraine
risks being prolonged]{.underline}, [it can also spread and escalate to
threaten the entire world]{.underline}. I must underline this obvious
point because the European dimension of the crisis has attracted
attention. But in the last 250 years, Europe has been remarkably
unsuccessful in containing conflicts in Europe to wars within Europe. So
[the whole world has a right to be concerned]{.underline}.

A 'just, democratic, inclusive, and rules-based international order' is
not just a mouthful. It can be an oxymoron. A just, democratic, and
inclusive international order has to be rules-based. It cannot be
otherwise. But there is no reason, a priori, why a rules-based order
should necessarily be just, democratic, or inclusive. [The international
order at any point in time is a constitutional settlement reflecting
power relations at its moment of origin]{.underline}. It changes slowly,
if at all, and often conditionally or contingently, as power equations
change.

[Revisionist projects, and resistance to them, are therefore the stuff
of international relations, and intrinsic to the international order and
its dynamics.]{.underline} Most such projects play by the rules. Brazil,
Germany, India, and South Africa have been campaigning unsuccessfully
for years to expand the permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
They can lead to institutional innovations: after failing to reform the
governance of multilateral financial institutions, China decided to set
up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank which is now backed by
nearly 100 countries, among them five members of G7. The Bandung
conference of 1955 was feared in the West as a move to set up a
parallel, non-Western United Nations. But despite problems with the UN
system, this remains unthinkable so long as we have hopes of reforming
it.
