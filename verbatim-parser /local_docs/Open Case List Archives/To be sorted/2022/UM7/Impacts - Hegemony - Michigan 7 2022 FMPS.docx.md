### Heg Bad -- Unsustainable

#### It's unsustainable- containment [trades off]{.underline} with domestic investments.

The US Faces Domestic Constraints

Third, [neo-primacy is of **questionable domestic
sustainability**]{.underline}---indeed, [it has the potential to
**undermine** the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates[']{.underline} [own strength]{.underline}.
Independent of competition with China, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates likely [**needs substantial investments** in
**healthcare**, **education**, and **infrastructure**]{.underline}
(among others) over the coming decades. Although some of these could be
funded as part of a neo-primacist competition with China, [other social
programs]{.underline} ([e.g., Social Security and public
pensions]{.underline}) [are likely to require additional funding,
particularly as US demographics change]{.underline}.59 [This situation
is further exacerbated as bills come due for the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates[']{.underline} **[prior spending]{.underline}**; as
the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported [even
**before**]{.underline} the **[COVID]{.underline}**-19 pandemic
[**reduced revenue** and **increased borrowing**]{.underline}, [by
2028]{.underline} "[the \[Federal\] government will spend **more on net
interest** than it will spend on either **defense** or **nondefense
discretionary outlays**]{.underline}." 60 Of course, the United States
can service its financial obligations by raising taxes, accepting
additional debt, or both.61 Unless the US economy grows faster than US
obligations, however, the United States will face a difficult choice in
the years ahead. On the one hand, policymakers can constrain the funding
available for foreign activities in order to devote the marginal
resource to domestic needs. In this situation, [neo-primacy could prove
**unsustainable**]{.underline}

### Heg Bad -- China Rise Now

#### Hegemony isn't sustainable, China is rising now

**McCoy 22** (Alfred McCoy, "Will the Fight for Hegemony Survive Climate
Change?", The Nation, February 25^th^ 2022,
<https://www.thenation.com/article/environment/climate-china-usa-beijing/>,
WC-NAS)

Consider us at the edge of the sort of epochal change not seen for
centuries, even millennia. By the middle of this century, we will be
living under such radically altered circumstances that the present
decade, the 2020s, will undoubtedly seem like another era entirely, akin
perhaps to the Middle Ages. And I'm not talking about the future
development of flying cars, cryogenics, or even as-yet-unimaginable
versions of space travel.

After leading the world for the past 75 years, the United States is ever
so fitfully losing its grip on global hegemony. As Washington's power
begins to fade, the liberal international system it created by founding
the United Nations in 1945 is facing potentially fatal challenges.

After more than 180 years of Western global dominion, leadership is
beginning to move from West to East, where Beijing is likely to become
the epicenter of a new world order that could indeed rupture
longstanding Western traditions of law and human rights.

More crucially, however, after two centuries of propelling the world
economy to unprecedented prosperity, the use of fossil
fuels---especially coal and oil---will undoubtedly fade away within the
next couple of decades. Meanwhile, for the first time since the last Ice
Age ended 11,000 years ago, thanks to the greenhouse gases those fossil
fuels are emitting into the atmosphere, the world's climate is changing
in ways that will, by the middle of this century, start to render
significant parts of the planet uninhabitable for a quarter, even
possibly half, of humanity.

For the first time in 800,000 years, the level of carbon dioxide (CO2)
in the atmosphere has [blown
past](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide) earlier
highs of 280 parts per million to reach 410 parts. That, in turn, is
unleashing climate feedback loops that, by century's end, if not well
before, will aridify the globe's middle latitudes, partly melt the polar
ice caps, and raise sea levels drastically. (Don't even think about
a [future
Miami](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/21/florida-climate-crisis-sea-level-habitat-loss) or
Shanghai!)

In trying to imagine how such changes will affect an evolving world
order, is it possible to chart the future with something better than
mere guesswork? My own field, history, generally performs poorly when
trying to track the past into the future, while social sciences like
economics and political science are loath to project much beyond
medium-term trends (say, the next recession or election). Uniquely among
the disciplines, however, environmental science has developed diverse
analytical tools for predicting the effects of climate change all the
way to this century's end.

Those predictions have become so sophisticated that world leaders in
finance, politics, and science are now beginning to think about how to
reorganize whole societies and their economies to accommodate the
projected disastrous upheavals to come. Yet surprisingly few of us have
started to think about the likely impact of climate change upon global
power. By combining political projections with already carefully plotted
trajectories for climate change, it may, however, be possible to see
something of the likely course of governance for the next half century
or so.

To begin with the most immediate changes, social-science analysis has
long predicted the end of US global power. Using economic projections,
the US National Intelligence Council, for
instance, [stated](http://www.dni.gov/files/documents/GlobalTrends_2030.pdf) that,
by 2030, "Asia will have surpassed North America and Europe combined in
terms of global power," while "China alone will probably have the
largest economy, surpassing that of the United States a few years before
2030." Using similar methods, the accounting firm
PwC [calculated](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/economy/the-world-in-2050.html) that
China's economy would become 60 percent larger than that of the United
States by 2030.

If climate science proves accurate, however, the hegemony Beijing could
achieve by perhaps 2030 will last, at best, only a couple of decades or
less before unchecked global warming ensures that the very concept of
world dominance, as we've known it historically since the sixteenth
century, may be relegated to a past age like so much else in our world.

Considering that likelihood as we peer dimly into the decades between
2030 and 2050 and beyond, the international community will surely have
good reason to forge a new kind of world order---one made for a planet
truly in danger and unlike any that has come before.

THE RISE OF CHINESE GLOBAL HEGEMONY

China's rise to world power could be considered not just the result of
its own initiative but also of American inattention. While Washington
was mired in endless wars in the Greater Middle East in the decade
following the September 2001 terrorist attacks, Beijing began using a
trillion dollars of its swelling dollar reserves to build a
tricontinental economic infrastructure it called the Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI) that would shake the foundations of Washington's world
order. Not only has this scheme already gone a long way toward
incorporating much of Africa and Asia into Beijing's version of the
world economy, but it has simultaneously lifted many millions out of
poverty.

During the early years of the Cold War, Washington funded the
reconstruction of a ravaged Europe and the development of 100 new
nations emerging from colonial rule. But as the Cold War ended in 1991,
more than a third of humanity was still living in extreme poverty,
abandoned by Washington's then-reigning neoliberal ideology that
consigned social change to the whims of the free market. By 2018,
nearly [half the world's
population](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2018/10/17/nearly-half-the-world-lives-on-less-than-550-a-day),
or about 3.4 billion people, were simply struggling to survive on the
equivalent of five dollars a day, creating a vast global constituency
for Beijing's economic leadership.

For China, social change began at home. Starting in the 1980s, the
Communist Party presided over the transformation of an impoverished
agricultural society into an urban industrial powerhouse. Propelled by
the greatest mass migration in history, as millions moved from country
to city, its [economy
grew](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview#1) nearly 10
percent annually for 40 years and lifted 800 million people out of
poverty---the fastest sustained rate ever recorded by any country.
Meanwhile, between 2006 and 2016 alone, [its industrial
output](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33534.pdf) increased from \$1.2
trillion to \$3.2 trillion, leaving the United States in the dust at
\$2.2 trillion and making China the workshop of the world.

By the time Washington awoke to China's challenge and tried to respond
with what President Barack Obama called a "strategic pivot" to Asia, it
was too late. With foreign reserves already at \$4 trillion in 2014,
Beijing [launched](https://www.cfr.org/report/chinas-belt-and-road-implications-for-the-united-states/) its
Belt and Road Initiative,
while [establishing](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/05/business/international/china-creates-an-asian-bank-as-the-us-stands-aloof.html) an
Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, with 56 member nations and an
impressive \$100 billion in capital. When a Belt and Road Forum of 29
world leaders convened in Beijing in May 2017, President Xi
Jinping [hailed](http://2017.beltandroadforum.org/english/n100/2018/0306/c25-1038.html) the
initiative as the "project of the century," aimed both at promoting
growth and improving "people's well-being" through "poverty
alleviation." Indeed, two years later a World Bank
study [found](http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/879031554144957551/pdf/) that
BRI transportation projects had already increased the gross domestic
product in 55 recipient nations by a solid 3.4 percent.

Amid this flurry of flying dirt and flowing concrete, Beijing seems to
have an underlying design for transcending the vast distances that have
historically separated Asia from Europe. Its goal: to forge a unitary
market that will
soon [cover](https://www.cfr.org/report/chinas-belt-and-road-implications-for-the-united-states/) the
vast Eurasian land mass. This scheme will consolidate China's control
over a continent that is home to 70 percent of the world's population
and productivity. In the end, it could also break the US geopolitical
grip over a region that has long been the core of, and key to, its
global power. The foundation for such an ambitious transnational scheme
is a monumental construction effort that in just two decades has already
covered China and much of Central Asia with a massive triad of energy
pipelines, high-speed rail lines, and highways.

To break that down, start with this: Beijing is building a
transcontinental network of natural gas and oil pipelines that will, in
alliance with Russia, extend for 6,000 miles from the North Atlantic
Ocean to the South China Sea.

For the second arm in that triad, Beijing
has [built](https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-high-speed-rail-development-worldwide) the
world's largest high-speed rail system, with more than 15,000 miles
already operational in 2018 and plans for a network of nearly 24,000
miles by 2025. All this, in turn, is just a partial step toward what's
expected to be a full-scale transcontinental rail system
that [started](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/business/global/hauling-new-treasure-along-the-silk-road.html) with
the "Eurasian Land Bridge" track running from China through Kazakhstan
to Europe. In addition to its transcontinental trunk lines, Beijing
plans branch-lines heading due south toward Singapore, southwest through
Pakistan, and then [from
Pakistan](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Belt-and-Road/Turkey-Iran-Pakistan-rail-link-to-China-s-Belt-and-Road) through
Iran to Turkey.

To complete its transport triad, China has also constructed an
impressive set of highways, representing (like those pipelines) a
problematic continuation of Washington's current petrol-powered world
order. In 1990, that country lacked a single expressway. By 2017,
it [had built](https://transportgeography.org/?page_id=1869) 87,000
miles of highways, nearly double the size of the US interstate system.
Even that breathtaking number can't begin to capture the extraordinary
engineering feats necessary---the tunneling through steep mountains, the
spanning of wide rivers, the crossing of deep gorges on towering
pillars, and the spinning of concrete webs around massive cities.

Simultaneously, China was also becoming the world's largest auto
manufacturer as the number of vehicles on its
roads [soared](http://autonews.gasgoo.com/china_news/70016117.html) to
340 million in
2019, [exceeding](https://www.statista.com/statistics/183505/number-of-vehicles-in-the-united-states-since-1990/) America's
276 million. However, all of this impressive news is depressing news as
well. After all, by clinging to coal production on a major scale, while
reaching for a bigger slice of the world's oil imports for its
transportation triad, China's greenhouse-gas [emissions
doubled](https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2021) from just 14
percent of the world's total in 2000 to 30 percent in 2019, far
surpassing that of the United States, previously the planet's leading
emitter. With only 150 vehicles [per
thousand](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/automotive%20and%20assembly/our%20insights/winning%20the%20race%20chinas%20auto%20market%20shifts%20gears/winning-the-race-chinas-auto-market-shifts-gears.ashx) people,
compared to 850 in America, its auto industry still has ample growth
potential---good news for its economy, but terrible news for the global
climate (even if China remains in
the [forefront](https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/China-green-future-ev-jan2021.pdf) of
the development and use of electric cars).

To power such headlong development, China has, in fact, raised its
domestic coal production more than a thousand-fold, from just 32 million
metric tons in 1949 to a
mind-boggling [record](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/business/china-coal-production-record-intl-hnk/index.html) of
4.1 billion tons by 2021. Even if you take into account those massive
natural-gas pipelines it is building, its enormous hydropower dams, and
its world leadership in wind power, as of 2020 China
still [depended](https://chinapower.csis.org/energy-footprint/) on coal
for a startling 57 percent of its total energy use, even as its share of
total global coal-fired
power [climbed](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-china-coal/china-generated-over-half-worlds-coal-fired-power-in-2020-study-idUSKBN2BK0PZ) relentlessly
to a record 53 percent. In other words, nothing, it seems, can break
that country's leadership of its insatiable hunger for the dirtiest of
all fossil fuels.

### Heg Bad -- Offshore Balancing

#### **Offshore Balancing works!**

**Walt 20** (Stephen Walt, columnist at Foreign Policy and the Robert
and Renée Belfer professor of international relations at Harvard
University, "The United States Forgot Its Strategy For Winning Cold
Wars", Foreign Policy, May 5th 2020,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/05/offshore-balancing-cold-war-china-us-grand-strategy/>,
WC-NAS)

[If a potential hegemon does appear, the United States should rely on
local forces in the threatened region as the first line of defense,
calibrating its support for these local actors with the level of the
challenge and their own capabilities. If these regional states cannot
contain a potential hegemon on their own, then the United States must
commit its own military power to the region to make sure the potential
hegemon cannot overawe and dominate its neighbors while at the same time
making sure that its local partners bear a fair share of the costs of
containment.]{.underline}

[During the Cold War, the essential features of containment followed
this basic logic perfectly.]{.underline} U.S. leaders did not believe
that the local powers in Europe or East Asia could stand up to the
Soviet challenge on their own, which is why Washington deployed
substantial U.S. forces to these critical regions in peacetime. Of
course, it might have been preferable in the abstract for the United
States to pass the buck to others, but the distribution of power in
Europe and Asia at the time made buck-passing infeasible.

There was no potential hegemon in the Persian Gulf, however, and the
Soviet Union did not seriously threaten to invade that region during the
Cold War. Nevertheless, to maintain the local balance of power and limit
Soviet influence, the United States relied on Britain (until the
mid-1960s) and on local clients such as Iran. After the Shah of Iran was
overthrown in 1979 and Iran became an adversary, Washington created the
Rapid Deployment Force. But it kept this force offshore and over the
horizon and did not send significant forces into the region until Iraq
seized Kuwait in 1990. This clear and obvious threat to the regional
balance of power led the United States to organize a large
coalition---in which its own forces played the predominant role---to
expel Iraq from Kuwait. This operation was fully consistent with
offshore balancing: The first Gulf War was an occasion when it made
sense for the United States to go "onshore."

[Most importantly, whenever the United States has abandoned offshore
balancing and pursued a different strategy, the results have invariably
been disastrous. The Vietnam War was not consistent with offshore
balancing, for example, because, as realist critics such as [Walter
Lippmann](https://archive.ph/o/W0SYt/https:/www.jstor.org/stable/23612509?seq=1), [Hans
Morgenthau](https://archive.ph/o/W0SYt/https:/www.nytimes.com/1965/04/18/archives/we-are-deluding-ourselves-in-vietnam-we-are-deluding-ourselves-in.html),
and [Kenneth
Waltz](https://archive.ph/o/W0SYt/https:/www.jstor.org/stable/3013947?seq=1) emphasized,
Indochina was not a vital strategic region and its fate could not alter
the global balance of power in any meaningful way.]{.underline} The
Clinton administration's adoption of "[dual containment" in the Gulf and
the recent U.S. wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya were also misguided
departures from offshore balancing]{.underline}, as they had little to
do with maintaining a favorable balance of power. Indeed, in the case of
Iraq, it shattered the local balance in the Persian Gulf to the benefit
of Iran.

What does offshore balancing prescribe today? As [I and
others](https://archive.ph/o/W0SYt/https:/www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2016-06-13/case-offshore-balancing) have
argued [at
length](https://archive.ph/o/W0SYt/https:/www.amazon.com/Hell-Good-Intentions-Americas-Foreign/dp/0374280037) [elsewhere](https://archive.ph/o/W0SYt/https:/www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2019-04-16/end-hubris),
there is no potential hegemon in Europe, and we are not likely to see
one emerge anytime soon. The United States should gradually disengage,
therefore, and let the Europeans provide for their own security. As for
the Persian Gulf, the region is as divided as it has ever been, and
there is no potential hegemon on the horizon. Moreover, its strategic
importance is likely to decline as the world gradually weans itself off
fossil fuels. [Thus, United States can return to the strategy it
followed from 1945 to 1991: keeping its own forces out of the region and
letting the competing Middle Eastern powers balance each
other.]{.underline}

The situation in Asia is dramatically different. China is a potential
hegemon in Asia, and it will remain one long after the COVID-19 pandemic
is behind us. Although Asia contains a number of capable medium-sized
powers, such as Japan, South Korea, and India, [it will not be easy for
them to form an effective balancing
coalition](https://archive.ph/o/W0SYt/https:/foreignpolicy.com/2010/05/03/balancing-act-asian-version/).
In this case, the United States needs to coordinate this effort and
commit its own forces. Buck-passing will not work. Although U.S.
military forces will have to be onshore in a number of places in Asia,
this policy is still fully consistent with the grand strategy of
offshore balancing.

[To be sure, preventing China from establishing regional hegemony in
Asia cannot stop Beijing from trying to build influence through its Belt
and Road Initiative or stop it from engaging in other efforts to expand
its diplomatic reach. But it would help limit Chinese influence by
maintaining an active U.S. presence in Asia and forcing China to focus
most of its attention closer to home.]{.underline} By reducing the U.S.
commitment to Europe and ending its costly military involvements in the
Middle East, offshore balancing would also free up resources that will
be needed to meet a future Chinese challenge, a problem that may be
increasingly acute in the post-coronavirus fiscal environment.

[Why is it a problem when people misrepresent offshore
balancing?]{.underline} Because we are finally having a serious and long
overdue debate about the proper grand strategy for the United States.
[The stakes are high, as the many failures that flowed from liberal
hegemony---the flawed grand strategy that U.S. leaders pursued during
the unipolar moment---make clear.]{.underline} Protagonists often try to
win policy debates by distorting their opponents' views, by falsely
associating their own recommendations with past successes, and by
denying any responsibility for repeated failures. [Deciding which
strategic options should guide U.S. policy in the future depends first
and foremost on a proper understanding of the different alternatives.
**An accurate understanding of offshore balancing will reveal that it
provided the foundation most of America's foreign-policy successes,
while departures from that strategy lie at the root of some of the
country's biggest missteps.**]{.underline}

### Heg -- Bipolarity

#### Bipolarity inevitable, stable, and solves nuclear conflict

**Kupchan 22** (Cliff Kupchan, "Bipolarity is Back: Why it Matters", The
Washington Quarterly, Volume 44, February 2^nd^ 2022,
<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true>,
NAS)

[Bipolarity is no longer returning---it is here, and it is here to stay
for the foreseeable future. News today is dominated by US-China
relations, indicating a recognition of today's bipolar system, and China
continues to close the gap in the economic realm.]{.underline} The
effects of this bipolarity have substantially deepened as elites in both
Washington and Beijing have become aware of the new global structure and
are acting accordingly. Structure and beliefs are amplifying each other.

[Because the world now has a bipolar distribution of capabilities, it
will be more peaceful than expected by the consensus
view.[1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true) Bipolar
structures deductively and empirically tend to be peaceful (stable);
regarding great power war---it is unlikely to
happen.[2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true) That
prognosis for the current period is strengthened because balancing or
competition between China and the United States will occur in the
economic arena to a far greater extent than in the more dangerous
military realm.]{.underline} The term ["Cold Peace" best captures the
current system]{.underline}; it will be broadly peaceful but by no means
warm. [Nationalist views in both the United States and China present a
potential risk to the stability forecast by bipolarity, primarily
through the specter of military conflict over Taiwan. This risk,
however, is much overhyped]{.underline}---predictability and nuclear
deterrence will very likely deter an invasion and preserve the Cold
Peace.

Competition in the economic arena will be far greater than the more
dangerous military realm

Bipolarity will, however, spur Chinese revisionism in some key economic
arenas, with direct implications for both geopolitics and firms. This
essay links the latest political science to market outcomes, drawing
heavily on realist thought, which posits that the distribution of
capabilities produces a structure that is the single greatest
determinant of outcomes. The presence of nuclear weapons is also a major
driver on the systemic level. It breaks from classical realism in
recognizing that elite beliefs are a third, significant driver of
events.

The essay will first present the evidence that the current system is
bipolar. It then explains why bipolarity, nuclear weapons, and elite
beliefs are the key drivers of states' policies. The piece then fleshes
out implications of the model for subsections of the international order
and concludes with implications for geopolitics.

The Data on Bipolarity

The evidence shows that the geopolitical system is bipolar, albeit with
a considerable degree of asymmetry because of US military dominance.
Bipolarity is established by data sufficient to support the claim that
two superpowers are: 1) broadly peer competitors regarding the
distribution of capabilities; and 2) separated from the "pack" by a
substantial gap. Bipolarity may exist even if there is a large gap
between the powers on a key metric. (In 1970, for instance, during a
period commonly referred to as bipolar, Soviet nominal GDP was roughly
40% of US
GDP).[3](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true) In
2020, Chinese nominal defense spending was 32 percent of US defense
spending, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute (SIPRI), on par with
2019.[4](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true) The
gap between China and the number three power, India, is huge; in 2020,
India's nominal defense spending was 29 percent that of
China.[5](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true)

The US advantage over China in the military realm is amplified by its
alliance network (China has far fewer allies), its nuclear preponderance
(3,750 warheads versus roughly 350 for China, likely growing to 1,000 by
2030), and its military-technological
advantage.[6](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true) In
addition, the US has at least 65 overseas bases, while China has
one---in
Djibouti.[7](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true) US
superiority is sufficient to establish strategic stability and deter
China from balancing against the US on a global level in the military
realm, at least for the foreseeable future. The gap is simply too big.
Regarding the sub-balance in the Asia-Pacific region, the trend is
toward parity, and balancing is ongoing. A focus of China's military
modernization has been to balance or surpass US power in the Taiwan
Strait. While China is closing the regional gap with the United States
in terms of air power and missile coverage, Washington still leads when
it comes to power projection capacity and the ability to conduct joint
combat
operations.[8](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true)

Regarding economics, China is much closer to a peer competitor. Its
nominal GDP was 71 percent that of the United States in 2020, according
to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), up from 67 percent in
2019.[9](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true) The
IMF predicts that number will rise to 74 percent in 2021, and many
sources predict China will surpass the United States within two
decades.[10](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true) Japan
is third at 34 percent of China's
GDP.[11](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true) With
regard to research and development, China has drawn dramatically close
to the United States. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) reports that in 2019, Chinese spending was 84 percent
of the US, up from 47 percent in 2010. The third-ranked country, Japan,
spends 36 percent of China's
budget.[12](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true) China
also leads the US on trade volume and on overall
investment.[13](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true) The
rapidly narrowing economic gap warrants graduation to full bipolarity.
And it is in this realm that severe balancing and competition will
occur.

Both countries are emerging from the pandemic with their formidable
structural strengths intact. The United States possesses the strongest
financial system, its currency remains dominant, it is a leader in
innovation, and it has one of the most favorable demographic outlooks
among leading powers. China has enormous innovative capacity, a high
savings rate, and the ability to mobilize and direct resources.

Soft power---the power to influence through attraction---affects
outcomes as
well.[14](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true) Its
impact is often less important than hard military or economic power, and
it is harder to measure. However, data from the Pew Research Center show
that this is the most significant locus of change over the past year---a
dramatic drop in China's favorability ratings among major industrialized
countries.[15](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true) Meanwhile,
foreign approval ratings for President Joe Biden are massively higher
than those of former president Donald Trump, suggesting a surge in US
soft
power.[16](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true)

These structural trends are robust. That said, each country has
challenges, such as political polarization in the United States, and
debt and demographic issues in China. A disjuncture like the breakup of
the Soviet Union is possible in either country, and this would end
bipolarity. But in coming decades that is unlikely because the
structural strengths of both countries are so profound. The data suggest
that this is a bipolar era, if a partly asymmetric one, and that
COVID-19 did nothing to change that structure and little to affect its
details.[17](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true)

Bipolarity, Nuclear Weapons, and Peace

[Bipolarity and nuclear weapons combined provide strong guardrails
against a great power war,]{.underline} a fact that is often overlooked
in the context of escalating US-China tensions and hand wringing about a
new Cold War. Bipolarity is less stable than the unipolar period that
preceded it, but more stable than the multipolar future that many
observers
foresee.[18](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true) [In
bipolar systems, the superpowers primarily use internal balancing, such
as arms buildups and bolstering economic strength, to offset each
other's
capabilities.[19](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true) External
balancing, such as the formation of alliances, is of secondary
importance because of the powers' outsized
capabilities.[20](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true) This
yields stability because internal balancing is more predictable,
reliable, and transparent than the use of alliances.]{.underline}

History is replete with examples of destabilizing alliance defections
under
multipolarity.[21](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true) For
instance, alliance jockeying in a multipolar landscape played a role in
the onset of both World War I and World War II. The 1890 suspension of
Germany's secret reinsurance with Russia set in motion balancing
dynamics that ultimately produced war between the Triple Alliance and
the Triple Entente. During the 1930s, alliance defections and
buck-passing cleared the way for Nazi Germany's unchecked advances both
before and after the outbreak of World War II. In other words,
operationally a bipolar system is more stable than a multipolar one
because the two main powers need to focus primarily on the actions of
the other---and not on those of many countries, as is necessary under
multipolarity.

Nuclear weapons, and the risk of escalation to the nuclear level, add a
huge overlay of caution to behavior. When two superpowers possess an
assured second-strike capability, each can cause the other catastrophic
harm---and that induces extreme caution. Weapons deployments and
competitions will continue, and advanced technologies will pose
challenges to nuclear stability. [War between two nuclear-armed
superpowers is surely possible; but the bottom line remains that nuclear
weapons make it very
unlikely]{.underline}.[22](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true) Moreover,
this caution interacts with the predictability of bipolarity to increase
restraint. A nation that can see what is coming and is already very
cautious is unlikely to miscalculate on decisions of war and peace.

[Bipolarity also injects a binary, fragmenting impulse into
international relations. Both superpowers pursue their interests, and
spheres of influence result. This imparts the fragmentation dynamic into
existing international relations and institutions.]{.underline}

[Nuclear weapons and the predictability of bipolarity both increase
security caution and restraint]{.underline}

Lastly, several features of the current operation of bipolarity and
nuclear weapons are important[. First, as it did during the Cold War,
some external balancing will occur, but it is of second-order importance
compared to the power of the two leading countries. Each superpower is,
as expected, recruiting allies, with the US focusing on the EU, the UK,
and Australia, while China focuses on emerging markets]{.underline}.
China is balancing almost exclusively internally, in line with the
expectations of bipolarity---in part because of the lack of allies.
While the US is primarily using internal balancing, Biden is also trying
to form a balancing coalition against China. His main successes so far
have been a harder-line EU policy and, in the military realm, AUKUS. The
latter, if the 8 agreed nuclear subs are built, will add to deterrence.
But even in this narrow field, deterrence will primarily rest with
internal balancing---flowing from the US and its large fleet, which
currently stands at 68 nuclear
subs.[23](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true) Second,
China and Russia on some issues balance against the US, which at times
marginally increases China's influence. But [on military issues, where
balancing is especially dangerous, it is very difficult to devise a
credible scenario in which Russia decides to join China in a war against
the US]{.underline}. Third, with focus on the US and China, scholars
have laid out the structural risks of war that occurs in the context of
a rising and a ruling power. Historically, this dynamic often leads to
war. But the aspirations of the new power and the fears of the older one
are doused by strong caution in the nuclear
age.[24](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2021.2020457?scroll=top&needAccess=true)

(what U.S. planners called "communism"), Washington's real-life

[The U.S.-sponsored **coup** **government** that murdered Allende would

[Proponents of liberal hegemony]{.underline} also [claim that the United
States must remain committed all over the world to prevent nuclear
prolif]{.underline}eration. If it reduces its role in key regions or
withdraws entirely, the argument runs, countries accustomed to U.S.
protection will have no choice but to protect themselves by obtaining
nuclear weapons. No grand strategy is likely to prove wholly successful
at preventing proliferation, but offshore balancing would do a better
job than [liberal hegemony]{.underline}. After all, [that strategy
failed to stop India and Pakistan]{.underline} from ramping up their
nuclear capabilities[, North Korea]{.underline} from becoming the newest
member of the nuclear club, [and Iran]{.underline} from making major
progress with its nuclear program. [Countries usually seek the bomb
because they **fear being attacked**, and U.S. efforts at regime change
**only heighten such concerns**]{.underline}. By [eschewing regime

offshore balancing [would give potential proliferators **less reason to

Offshore balancing would also reduce the risk of terrorism. [Liberal

to terrorism]{.underline}. (It is worth remembering that [Osama bin

troops]{.underline} in his homeland of Saudi Arabia.) [In addition to
inspiring terrorists, liberal hegemony facilitates their
operations:]{.underline} using [regime change]{.underline} to spread
American values [undermines local institutions and creates ungoverned
spaces where violent extremists can flourish]{.underline}. [Offshore
balancing would alleviate this problem by eschewing social engineering
and minimizing the United States\' military foot-print. U.S. troops
would be stationed on foreign soil only when a country was in a vital
region and threatened by a would-be hegemon.]{.underline} In that case,
the potential victim would view the United States as a savior rather
than an occupier. And [once the threat had been dealt with, U.S.
military forces could go back over the horizon and not stay behind to
meddle in local politics]{.underline}. [By respecting]{.underline} the

The Limits of Realist Policy Alternatives Regardless of any analytical
limitations of their critiques, however, [the pragmatically more
significant shortcoming of realist critiques is their struggle to offer
more promising alternative paths to international order. Although
realist critics identify important problems with liberal hegemony, what
of the alternative international order strategies they
offer?]{.underline} Are defenders of a US-led "liberal" international
order project right that despite its flaws it is still nevertheless the
best international order strategy among bad options, if modifications
are made? While the critiques leveled by realists may identify important
problems and make some damaging points, [the alternative policy
proposals they offer suffer from their own serious limitations, when
scrutinized. From closer examination and consideration, that is, these
limitations of alternative realist foreign policies questions their
ability to contribute to international order in the twenty-first century
and suggest, quite the opposite, that if pursued they would instead
become new sources of international disorder]{.underline}, albeit while
avoiding some of the problems associated with liberal internationalism.
Realist critics have offered variations on balance of power foreign
policy proposals, suggesting that the deployment and use of US forces
should be restricted to only vital US interests, while abandoning
ambitions of democratizing other states.Mearsheimer and Walt in
particular make cases for "restraint" and "offshore balancing," meaning
a reservation of the use of force to the most serious threats to US
power, coupled with a policy to prevent China's assumption of regional
hegemony in Asia (Mearsheimer and Walt 2016). Mearsheimer explains that
when following a realist policy of restraint, there are only a limited
number of regions where \[the US\] should be willing to risk a war.
Those places include the great power's own neighbourhood and distant
areas that are either home to another great power or the site of a
critically important resource. For the United States, three regions
outside the Western Hemisphere are of vital strategic importance today:
Europe and East Asia, because that is where the other great powers are
located; and the Persian Gulf, because it is the main source of an
exceptionally important resource, oil. (Mearsheimer 2018, 222)

Mearsheimer argues this more strategically "restrained" policy will
better manage the balance of power, reduce the amount of wars by
eliminating liberal interventionism, and improve great power diplomatic
relations by easing liberal antagonism of non-democracies. Walt likewise
strongly argues for realist foreign policy of "offshore balancing",
meaning a deployment of US forces only where necessary, while more
heavily relying on allies and strategic partners to balance regional
challengers and Russia and China. Walt provides a clear description of
this policy and its logic, worth quoting at length, to fairly convey its
contents: Under a strategy of offshore balancing, the proper role and
size of the U.S. national security establishment depends on the
distribution of power in the key regions. If there is no potential
hegemon in sight in Europe, Northeast Asia, or the Gulf, there is little
reason to deploy U.S. ground or air forces there and little need for a
national security establishment that dwarfs those of the major powers.
If a potential hegemon does appear, the United States should turn to
local forces as the first line of defense. It should expect them to
uphold the regional balance of power out of their own self-interest and
to deal with local security challenges themselves. Washington might
provide material assistance and pledge to support certain regional
powers if they were in danger of being conquered, but it should refrain
from deploying significant U.S. forces under most conditions... In
essence, this strategy aims to keep U.S. forces "offshore" for as long
as possible while recognizing that sometimes the United States will have
to come onshore even before a conflict starts. If that happens, the
United States should get its allies in the region to do as much of the
heavy lifting as possible and go back offshore once the threat has been
defeated. (Walt 2018, 262--63) The realist foreign policy alternative of
"offshore balancing" aims to balance against potential hegemons in
overseas regions, but with emphasis on using US allies to invest in that
balancing. The benefits of this policy, Walt argues, are partly that it
reduces costs by requiring allies to contribute more, but more
importantly that it preserves US power by managing its de ployment and
avoiding costly interventions with US forces. [Compared to a policy of
liberal hegemony that has been troubled by costly military
interventions, these realist policy alternatives on a superficial
reading appear sensible and even peace-loving, because they advocate
restricting intervention to a much higher threshold condition of
defending vital security interests. Yet, under scrutiny, these realist
policy proposals suffer from two key limitations that ultimately
question their ability to contribute to international order in the
twenty-first century and suggest that if pursued they would instead
become new sources of international disorder (McKeil 2021), even if they
avoided the problems associated with liberal
interventionism.]{.underline} Firstly, and most troubling, is the
likelihood that realist policy alternatives would contribute to proxy
wars between the great powers in strategic regions. [That is, a realist
policy of restraint and offshore balancing means less US-led
interventionism, but an equal amount and plausibly more proxy wars,
where the United States would seek to defend its strategic interests
indirectly. In fairness to realist policies, they prudently cede key
states neighboring Russia and China, such as Ukraine and
Myanmar]{.underline}, thereby avoiding proxy wars in such strategically
sensitive territories (Mearsheimer 2014). [It is nevertheless
concerning, however, that realist proposals for "restraint" and
"offshore balancing" do not offer a genuine foreign policy alternative
for crises such as Syria, where both the Obama and Trump administrations
have already sought to avoid direct intervention, by waging protracted a
proxy war with regional consequences and casualties in the hundreds of
thousands.]{.underline} The costs and dramatically circumscribed
successes of interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as Libya,
have already made it an increasingly commonsense belief that direct
interventions are infeasible, even misguided, but this has suggested to
many that therefore more use of proxies is the only feasible policy
option for certain crises. The literature on proxy wars suggests that
states engage in proxy wars when their interests are perceived to be
threatened, but direct intervention with their own forces is also
perceived to be too high-risk or too costly (Groh 2019, 8). Proxy wars
are "war on the cheap" and they have the advantage of reducing potential
escalation to direct great power conflict and nuclear war at the highest
and last stage of escalation. A policy of restraint as such follows the
perception that use of US forces in small wars is too costly and too
high-risk where great powers may come into direct conflict. [Yet, by
increasing this threshold for intervention, realist policy alternatives
decrease the threshold at which the United States would use strategic
partners to wage proxy wars against assumptive hegemons, or to suppress
terrorist groups, or secure vital resources.]{.underline} Let me unpack
these points further. A degree of skepticism is warranted about the
extent to which realist policies of restraint and offshore balancing
would be conducive to international order, and not a series of
protracted proxy wars. As a recent study on proxy wars notes, "If the
United States does less, it must rely on others to do more" (Berman and
Lake 2019, 3). Inversely, however, if the United States does less, its
proxies must also rely on the United States for more support, and when
allies and partners engage in conflict for their own interests, for
instance, they likely will call for support in terms of kit, including
heavy arms, finance, training, and perhaps air support, even while US
"boots on the ground" are denied. Where crises emerge and allies and
strategic partners become unstable or engaged in a local or regional
conflict, a realist-guided US foreign policy would be inclined to
support US partners and allies as proxies for US forces. Because the use
of US forces would have a higher threshold, but because realists also
advise maintaining the material balance of power, a realist-guided US
foreign policy would become more easily persuaded to engage in proxy
wars. Furthermore, because it is a "cheap" way to balance, the United
States could engage a wide number of proxy wars simultaneously, almost
indefinitely. This strategic environment would also tempt the United
States to trap Russian or Chinese forces in costly protracted wars
against US proxies, along the model of Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,
as a strategy to drain the power of China and Russia and limit their
ability to engage in other conflicts. The potential for a wide number of
proxy wars could potentially condemn the twenty-first century to the
miseries and suffering of a series of protracted proxy wars waged with
ever-more sophisticated weapons technology. Proxy wars are an immense
source of international disorder because they tend to be protracted,
devastating the countries in which they are waged. They are also
generative of regional consequences including humanitarian and refugee
crises, as well as new military groups operating across borders, whose
long-term alignment with the United States is not always ensured. The
Syrian civil war, for example, evolved into a proxy war with immense
loss of life and consequences for regional stability (Hughes 2014). It
involved embedding of US forces in proxy forces against
Russian-supported government forces. At the same time, the diminishing
presence of the United States in the region and inconsistent US support
for key partners has been a critical contributor to the intensity,
duration, and regional involvement in the Syrian conflict (Phillips
2020). Realists rightly suggest diplomacy is required to unwind the
conflict in Syria, yet, where the United States withdraws its presence,
as realist policies advise, proxy wars will tend to continue and emerge
without diplomatic breakthroughs, which require years to develop,
achieve, and implement. Realist thinkers foresee as an emerging "bounded
order", divided between China and the United States (Mearsheimer 2019).
A bounded order pocketed by a series of proxy wars is not unimaginable
and well within the realist vision of the emerging twenty-first century.
The conditions of potential nuclear war and the global scope of the
struggle made proxy warfare a common ingredient of the Cold War. A
realist policy of US restraint and offshore balancing without sufficient
additional measures to develop a stable international order likely would
contribute to a series of proxy wars between the great powers seeking to
support their partners and defend their vital interests through proxy
forces in key regions. The fighting itself would invariably differ from
that of the Cold War with state and nonstate proxies likely being mixed
with use of remote weapons and cyber war, for instance (Innes 2012;
Krieg and Rickli 2019). The ideological contest between the great powers
will also instead likely become increasingly geo-cultural and
geo-civilizational, not simply geostrategic or purely geopolitical
(Coker 2019; Acharya 2020). But the conditions of security competition,
high risks of direct conflict, lower costs of proxy warfare, and realist
proposals for doctrines limiting the use of US forces with little other
institutional measures for managing conflict likely would precipitate
protracted proxy wars where conflicts emerge. Proxy wars, moreover, are
an international activity with virtually no international rules beyond
those applying to the conduct of war in general. This assessment of
realist foreign policy proposals suggests that additional policy
measures are required for developing a stable international order, to
avoid proxy wars where possible and to contain and resolve them when
they do emerge, in addition to further global challenges. Realists are
not opposed to the use of diplomacy to avoid and manage conflict. To the
contrary, they encourage it, but in encouraging the use of diplomacy it
is crucial to recognize that diplomacy also requires the support of
international institutions and established diplomatic networks.
Diplomatic breakthroughs are difficult to achieve, requiring years of
skillful and patient negotiations. Diplomacy, moreover, is an inconstant
and limited tool without the support of broader international
institutions that provide mechanisms of delay, ongoing networks of
collaborative great power pressure on belligerent parties, and
collaboratively developed processes and agreed terms of dispute
resolution, negotiation, and mediation. Realist critics of liberal
hegemony often suggest policy-fuzzy gestures toward diplomacy and
accommodation. Porter for instance argues that the United States should
abandon liberal hegemony in favor of détentestyle collaboration with
illiberal powers in the making of global order (Porter 2020, 170--99).
The key strategic proposal Porter advances is to attempt a settlement
with Russia with significant mutual concessions, including sacrificing
the interests of non-NATO countries on its eastern flank, in order to
ease the growing sense of mutual threat. To facilitate negotiations, the
USA should revive government-togovernment dialogue to reach a new
bargain. (Porter 2020, 187) This is a strategy to ease pressure on
Russia, in the hopes of encouraging tensions between Russia and China,
which Porter proposes to combine with a reduction of forces in the
Middle East, and a containment strategy against China in Asia, by
cultivating regional strategic partners. This proposal in the abstract
sounds promising and genuinely contains helpful strategic thought, but
does not propose sufficient measures to produce a lasting and stable
order, and crucially requires the willingness to collaborate from
Russia, which Porter admits is not guaranteed to be forthcoming (Porter
2020, 188). There is surely more needed for the construction of a stable
and lasting order between the United States and China than a containment
balancing strategy, even if it were successful in dividing Russia from
China. Where the first proxy war between the United States and China
would emerge can only be speculated. China, like the United States, has
the capacity to wage indirect warfare, incentives to avoid direct
conflict, and experience from the Cold War. This as such poses a second
limitation of realist policy alternatives; they are insufficiently
ambitious in developing new and revised ordering of international
institutions and take for granted the role of deeper primary
institutions in producing international order (Mearsheimer 1994--1995).2
With limited confidence in the use of international institutions,
realists struggle to provide a substantive and sufficient strategy for
producing international order. Realists do acknowledge the importance of
major institutions such as the United Nations or World Trade
Organization for providing general 2 In this discussion, I define
international institutions both narrowly as regulative organizations and
broadly as bundles of constitutive and patterning rules and norms.
"rules of the road" that clarify expectations among states (Mearsheimer
2018, 131; Walt 2018, 71). Yet, realists offer no suggestions for
reforming these institutions for current challenges, nor do they see
much promise in developing new institutions, and ultimately claim
international institutions are ineffective because they have "no
coercive leverage over states" in a context where states in anarchy find
themselves in security competition precipitating conflict (Mearsheimer
2018, 131). As Mearsheimer states, "The nub of the dispute between
liberals and realists regarding both institutions and economic
interdependence has to do with whether they promote world peace.
Liberals believe they ameliorate conflict; realists do not" (Mearsheimer
2018, 143). Walt provides a clear explanation of the realist lack of
confidence in institutions where he states, As multilateral
organizations such as NATO, the World Bank, or the World Trade
Organization have shown repeatedly, international institutions can
facilitate cooperation when states have clear and obvious incentives to
work together, but they cannot stop powerful states from acting as they
wish and thus cannot remove the danger of conflict and war.
International institutions are simply a tool that states use to advance
their interests, and they inevitably reflect the interests of the most
powerful states. (Walt 2018, 71) Because institutions lack an ability to
coerce great powers, realists claim, they have little to no impact on
conflict between great powers that arises as a result of security
competition. Because of this lack of realist confidence in institutions,
Walt and leading economist Dani Rodrick have instead advanced a global
order proposal for constructing a collection of select global
"meta-norms" as conflict avoidance and resolution mechanisms at a global
level (Rodrik and Walt 2021). This proposal is important and in the
right direction, as a needed element of building shared global order,
but it is also a thin set of meta-norms, highly modest and limited in
their order-making capacities and ambitions. The proposal does not
include integrative institutions to formalize and embed meta-norms, nor
does it provide inclusive principles to legitimate those meta-norms
beyond the imperative to avoid direct great power conflict. Walt and
Rodrick, moreover, suggest that their international order proposal
exists within an emerging "bounded order" marked by proxy wars, and
concede their meta-norms do little to help mitigate or resolve proxy
wars, focusing more on avoiding direct great power conflict (Rodrik and
Walt 2021, 20).

#### Mearsheimer and Walt are wrong; offshore balancing undermines global stability 

**Hoffman 16** (Frank G. Hoffman, Board of Advisors at the Foreign
Policy Institute and a Distinguished Research Fellow with the Institute
for National Strategic Studies", "Retreating Ashore: The Flaws of
Offshore Balancing", Foreign Policy Research Institute, July 5^th^ 2016,
<https://www.fpri.org/2016/07/retreating-ashore-flaws-offshore-balancing/>,
WC-NAS)

[While Offshore Balancing claims some historical evidence and some
relevant geostrategic advantages as the basis for an American strategy,
there are a few distinct disadvantages from a pragmatic perspective.  By
passing the buck, Mearsheimer and Walt want to have their cake
(America's core interests preserved) and eat it too (a smaller and less
costly defense establishment). The authors note that the U.S. represents
only 46% of the NATO Alliance's aggregate GDP but that our defense
spending "contributes" 75% of NATO's military spending.  This is a
canard however, as it compares the total US defense establishment as if
all these resources were devoted to the defense of NATO
countries]{.underline}.  Obviously, U.S. defense spending far exceeds
the regional-oriented European states.  Just as obviously [the \$535B
U.S. defense budget includes resources for homeland defense, military
health care, a large American R&D establishment, numerous domestic
military bases, and a sizable strategic deterrent. Some of our budget
directly supports either our own homeland security or our interests in
Asia.  But these resources are not directly related to NATO defense and
thus the comparison is meaningless]{.underline}.  Untested by the pair
is the presumption that by withdrawing our forces from Europe and Korea,
there will be substantial savings.    

[Some advocates of this approach would abandon many, if not all, of
America's treaties and security obligations.  Walt and Mearsheimer are
vague on this in their Foreign Affairs article but many advocates
explicitly reject NATO or our bilateral Pacific partners as
obligations.  Dr. Mearsheimer has called for U.S. [withdrawal from
NATO](https://www.charleskochinstitute.org/evaluating-u-s-foreign-policy-since-end-cold-war/)  in
the past. No mention is made about other allies or partners, and
presumably Israel is also left adrift to care for itself, until it is
nearly overrun.]{.underline}

[The biggest flaw in their argument involves allied state behavior if
this strategy became operative]{.underline}. This approach argues that
it exploits the capabilities of regional players in their own
neighborhood where they have vital interests in order to preserve
stability.  Instead of risking resource overstretch by the extensive
investment in building up and posturing U.S. military forces around the
globe, Japan, South Korea and our NATO allies would be expected to
provide more for their own national and regional security commensurate
with their interests.  These major regional powers would police
themselves in their interaction with other powers. 

[But this assumes that regional powers share our interests and have the
will and capacity to stabilize the region. China's actions (and Russia's
in the Black Sea or Iran's in the Persian Gulf) suggest that these
assumptions are frail. Mearsheimer and Walt fail to consider the
possibility that such countries will not take advantage or operate
against U.S. allies negatively.  Their hope is an illusion belied by the
rising level of geopolitical competition of the last several years. 
Withdrawal from East Asia and the Pacific or Europe is not likely to
have a stabilizing effect on these region.  This produces a very
reactive strategy that arguably increases the chances of a war breaking
out, for example in Korea or in the South China Sea.]{.underline} 

[The fourth problem relates to the law of unintended
consequences]{.underline}.  As Dr. Hal Brands has noted, [this version
of OSB appears to offer numerous benefits at little risk, but in fact,
the [risks and
liabilities](https://twq.elliott.gwu.edu/sites/twq.elliott.gwu.edu/files/downloads/Brands_Summer%202015.pdf) including
greater nuclear proliferation, are indeed quite significant.   Critical
allies like Japan would face a stark choice having to hedge against a
lack of commitment from the United States and would need to appease or
negotiate a subservient position to Chinese
hegemony]{.underline}.  Other scholars have noted this particular [fatal
flaw](https://twq.elliott.gwu.edu/sites/twq.elliott.gwu.edu/files/downloads/Brands_Summer%202015.pdf) in
OSB:

[In East Asia today, U.S. allies rely on U.S. reassurance to navigate
increasingly fraught relationships with a more assertive China precisely
because they understand that they will have great trouble balancing
Beijing on their own. A significant U.S. retrenchment might therefore
tempt these countries to acquiesce to, or bandwagon with, a rising
China]{.underline} if they felt that prospects for successful resistance
were diminishing as the United States retreated.

[A related strategic and operational disadvantage that Mearsheimer and
Walt fail to recognize is the presumption that U.S. forces will have the
capability to regain access to key regions during crises.  Offshore
balancing places our forces back at home, far from future flashpoints. 
The further one distances U.S. capabilities from its interests in
critical regions of the world, the slower and harder it is to make an
effective response. ]{.underline}

Having abandoned Asia or the Middle East, returning after being absent
for some time is not a matter of simply sailing back.  Having unburdened
ourselves of forward stationed forces and basing, port and airfield
infrastructure will be needed to deploy forces at great distances, we
should be more realistic about the time and cost involved in generating
combat power overseas in the absence of access.  Regaining access and
bringing forces to bear will be harder and take longer for future U.S.
Presidents under such a strategy. [Embedded in OSB is the notion that
American credibility, commitment and capabilities can be "surged" at
will.  That's not how the world works.  More likely, our perceived
detachment would undercut U.S. crisis management actions and our
diplomacy.  Certainly, it would make U.S. policy actions reactive and
belated. ]{.underline}

My preferred alternative to OSB was published in Orbis several years
ago.  This option, which I deliberately titled "[Forward
Partnership](https://www.fpri.org/article/2013/12/forward-partnership-a-sustainable-american-strategy/),"
rejects OSB's assumptions, its reactive character, and reduces the
distance it puts between the U.S. and its friends. This strategy accepts
that unilateral action in this century is a bankrupt method and that
alliances and multilateral responses are in our interests. This strategy
embraces the need to engage broadly with designated partners and friends
to preserve regional stability without extensive forward-stationed
forces. As suggested by the name, this strategy operates forward with
alliances and partners to leverage cooperative and preventive actions to
preclude conflicts before they occur. It uses forward-deployed naval
power and Special Operations Force assets to generate and sustain
preventive actions and promote true partnerships (vice dependencies).
The strategy focuses on critical national interests in the global
commons, ensuring access to critical markets and resources, for
ourselves and our partners. Rather than husbanding our forces ashore in
California or Norfolk this strategy is forward with our partners,
retaining our regional access, our influence, and our interoperability
with our friends. Far better than detachment, this strategy is more
reassuring and actually balances. It also provides a flexible deterrent
posture that is able to move where and when needed. This element,
flexible presence without costly stationary posture, is a far better
tool for balancing than what Mearsheimer and Walt offer. In short,
OSB--as presented by academics--is less of a strategy about how to
secure U.S. interests more efficiently, and is more of a dodge. As
presented, it is not a strategy that advances our core interests.
Overall, this strategic approach cedes the initiative and our national
interests to another power until that power, a friend or foe, takes
actions that we deem unacceptable. There is something to be said for
restricting imperial overstretch and for calibrating U.S. interests with
greater discipline, but sacrificing U.S. leadership and contributions to
global stability is simply a retreat, and one that is ill-timed. If
there was a strategy destined to accelerate the unraveling of world
order, and the establishment of the United States as accelerator to the
demise of global stability, this is it. Certainly, in the face of rising
revisionist powers and constrained resources, we should not ignore the
value of collective security. Surely, as Jakub Grygiel has persuasively
argued, we can do more to [arm our
allies](https://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/issues/Autumn_2015/7_Grygiel.pdf)
along the frontiers of freedom. Nor should we shrink from the embattled
peripheral countries where allies and partners are [particularly
vulnerable](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2011/03/01/the-vulnerability-of-peripheries/)
and where collective defense is needed to stand up to coercive states.
If adopted at this point in history, OSB would just represent another
distinct step toward the [disintegration of
Europe](https://www.iiss.org/en/politics%20and%20strategy/blogsections/2016-d1f9/june-ccc4/a-step-towards-disintegration-b92f?_cldee=aG9mZm1hbmZnQGFvbC5jb20%3d&urlid=6)
and the alliance structure that has underwritten peace and prosperity
for the last generation. Rather than husband U.S. resources, it
abdicates our leadership position, abandons friends and allies, and
dismisses our ability to shape events. On one hand it minimizes the
possibility of making foreign policy mistakes and eliminates
entanglements. But it only does that by increasing instability however,
and ensures that U.S. forces will arrive belatedly and at a
disadvantage. We need a strategy that avoids being the [Crusader
State](https://www.amazon.com/Promised-Land-Crusader-State-Encounter/dp/0395901324),
without abandoning friends and encouraging opponents. This strategy
reenacts the myths of Splendid Isolation that some British policy makers
mistook for strategy in the last century. Mearsheimer and Walt's
version, one we might call Delighted Detachment, would be an even worse
disaster. OSB, as presented, is a strategy that makes a virtue out of
ignoring strategic interests, eluding obligations and responsibilities,
and avoiding disciplined strategic choices. Were we living in the 1990s,
at the apex of the [Unipolar
Era](https://nationalinterest.org/article/the-unipolar-moment-revisited-391),
this strategy would be relevant. Today, it risks power vacuums, entices
regional aggression, and puts U.S. military forces at both a strategic
and operational disadvantage.  Developing a more viable strategy,
without these defects, will be a critical task for the next President.
