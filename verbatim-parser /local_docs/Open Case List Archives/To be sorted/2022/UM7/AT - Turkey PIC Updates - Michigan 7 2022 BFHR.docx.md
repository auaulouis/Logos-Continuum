\[Alexandra. "Turkey's War on Kurds: Kurdish Refugees Threatened At
Makhmour Refugee Camp." Human Rights Pulse. Sept 13, 2021.

On 1 June 2021, [Turkish President]{.underline} Recep Tayyip
[[Erdogan]{.mark} [threatened]{.mark} to launch an [operation]{.mark}
[to "cleanse" the Makhmour refugee camp]{.mark}, home to over 13,000
Kurdish refugees]{.underline}. The [self-defence forces of the
democratically elected assembly that have been fighting off ISIS now
find themselves threatened by **[another of Turkey's attempts at ethnic
cleansing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Amidst worldwide silence and a
failure to stop Turkish aggression, a human rights crisis that has been
going on for over a century needs to be finally recognised and spoken
about.]{.underline}

IMPERIAL AMBITIONS, SYSTEMATIC OPPRESSION, AND A REFUGEE CRISIS

After decades of not being able to speak Kurdish in Turkey,
[[Kurds]{.mark} still [face oppression]{.mark} and are threatened within
and outside of the Turkish borders.]{.underline} Since 1984, the
[Turkish Government and Army have destroyed over 4,000 Kurdish villages,
killed over 30,000 Kurdish civilians, imprisoned around 500,000 Kurdish
activists and political leaders, and forcefully relocated over three
million Kurds.]{.underline} Kurds living in the southeast region of
Turkey have been [subject to systematic oppression, extreme torture,
sexual abuse and rape from the Turkish police and army, enforced
disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and arbitrary
detentions.]{.underline}

[The three million displaced Kurds fled to Iraq from Turkey]{.underline}
in the 1990s and established the Atrush Camp from which they had to flee
once again due to Turkish military aggression. The origins of the
Makhmour Camp date back to 1998. Ankara has long viewed the Makhmour
camp as a place where militants and their sympathisers reside. [Tu[rkish
president Erdogan referred to it as a "terror-nest"]{.mark} and stated
that "If the UN does not clean (it) up, we will as a UN member". [This
is not the first time the refugees would face Turkish aggression]{.mark}
as the camp was previously bombed in June 2020.]{.underline}

Reuters reports that protests took place in Sulaimaniya following the
Turkish bombardments. Dozens marched with Kurdish flags denouncing the
Turkish invasion and chanting "our voices are voices of freedom against
occupation". Protester Omid Saleh provided an account of the events,
stating that "they are killing women and children...Turkey wants to
occupy Kurdistan".

VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW; A HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE

[Despite the clear human rights violations and evident military
aggression, the United Nations and the United States support Turkish
plans to dissolve the camp and send its inhabitants back to
Turkey.]{.underline} However, [the Kurds of Makhmour Camp cannot safely
return]{.underline} there[. A Turkish attack]{.underline} like the
previous attacks against Afrin and Ras al-Ain [would lead once again to
mass displacement, grave war crimes, and the loss of innocent
lives.]{.underline} **[[Erdogan's threats]{.mark} of "cleansing" the
camp [amidst the current Turkish military action in Iraqi
territory]{.mark} against Kurdish forces, launched on 23 April 2021,
would signify a violation of international law, [a humanitarian
catastrophe]{.mark}, and an open violation of the non-refoulement
principle.]{.underline}**

[US Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfiled, expressed
a deep concern about "violence near the camp" and called on all sides to
respect the rights of refugees. She stated that she had made clear to
Turkish officials during her visit to Turkey that "any attack targeting
civilians at Makhmour refugee camp would be a violation of international
and humanitarian law".]{.underline}

CONTINUOUS VIOLENCE AND MILITARY AGGRESSION AT MAKHMOUR REFUGEE CAMP

According to a report from the news agency Rudaw, a recent Turkish
airstrike targeting the refugee camp left at least three people dead.
All this amidst [Turkey weaponising water in northern Syria by
intentionally cutting off access to water for millions of innocent
civilians.]{.underline} **[The accel[erating military aggression against
civilian target]{.mark}s in border villages [raises alarming
questions]{.mark} relating to the continuous genocidal policy of Turkey
against Kurds and Turkey's imperial ambitions of building military bases
in Kurdish majority areas in Iraq and the annexation of areas of Iraq
and Syria, as Operation Olive Branch in 2018
demonstrates]{.underline}**. The recent attack was one of Turkey's
deepest into Iraqi territory since it launched operations Claw-Lighting
and Claw-Thunderbolt on 23 April.

[It is clear that Turkey's claim of fighting against armed groups is
simply a pretext to continue the genocidal campaign against
Kurds]{.underline}. The questions that need to be posed here are many.
Why is the United Nations silent? Why is there no international uproar?
Most importantly, [when will this Turkish aggression stop]{.underline}?

#### Internal variables make meaningful reform impossible. Lack of independent judiciary, expansion of executive authority, crack down on human rights advocates, and restrictions on protest thump.

TURKEY 2021

Deep [[flaws]{.mark} in the judicial system were [not
addressed.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Opposition politicians, journalists,
human rights defenders and others faced baseless investigations,
prosecutions and convictions.]{.underline} Turkey [withdrew from the
Istanbul Convention]{.underline}. Government officials [targeted LGBTI
people with homophobic rhetoric]{.underline}. Freedom of [peaceful
assembly was severely curtailed]{.underline}. A [new law unduly
restricted freedom of association for civil society
organizations.]{.underline} Serious and [credible allegations of torture
and other ill-treatment]{.underline} were made. Turkey hosted 5.2
million migrants and refugees, but [thousands of asylum seekers were
denied entry]{.underline}. Physical attacks against refugees and
migrants increased in the context of rising anti-refugee rhetoric.

Background

The **[[new]{.mark} [Human Rights Action Plan]{.mark} and two Judicial
Reform Packages [prepared]{.mark} by the Ministry of Justice
[failed]{.mark} [to address deep flaws in the
judiciary]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

In October, **[parliament extended the mandate for military operations
in Syria and Iraq for another two years.]{.underline}** A threat by the
president to expel 10 Western ambassadors after they called for the
immediate release of civil society leader Osman Kavala was withdrawn
after several days.

State overreach

Judiciary and lawyers

In January, the Ministry of Justice granted permission to open an
investigation against 12 executives of the Ankara Bar Association. They
were accused of "insulting a public officer" for criticizing homophobic
and discriminatory remarks made by the president of the Directorate for
Religious Affairs during a Friday sermon in 2020. In April, the Ankara
court accepted the indictment. In July, the same permission was granted
for the investigation against members of the Istanbul and Izmir bar
associations for "insulting religious values". The investigations and
prosecutions were ongoing at the end of the year.

In July[, [parliament]{.mark} [approved]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n omnibus
[bill]{.mark} **extending emergency powers for another year** and
[allowing the dismissal of public servants]{.mark}]{.underline},
including judges and prosecutors, [[for]{.mark} having [alleged links to
"terrorist" organizations without the possibility of judicial
review]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Repression of dissent

In [January, the [Ankara]{.mark} [court accepted]{.mark} a
[3,530-page]{.mark} [indictment]{.mark} for the prosecution of 108
people, including former and present members of the People's Democratic
Party (HDP]{.underline}) and its former co-leader Selahattin Demirtaş[.
The indictment contained 29 separate charges including "intentional
killing" and "disrupting the unity and territorial integrity of the
state." They were accused of mobilizing masses to commit violence during
protests on 6-8 October 2014 under the instructions of the Kurdistan
Workers Party (PKK]{.underline}). Dubbed the "Kobani trial", proceedings
were ongoing at the end of the year.

In March, human rights defender and opposition parliamentarian Ömer
Faruk Gergerlioğlu was stripped of his immunity and imprisoned after the
Court of Cassation upheld his two-and-a-half-year prison sentence for
sharing a tweet in 2016. He was released after almost three months in
custody following a ruling in July by the Constitutional Court that his
rights to liberty and to participate in political life had been
violated.

In April, in another case against Selahattin Demirtaş, the Court of
Cassation upheld his four years and eight months' prison sentence for
"making propaganda for a terrorist organization". In September and
December, the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers monitoring the
implementation of the December 2020 Demirtaş v Turkey decision by the
European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), reiterated its call for his
immediate release.

In September, the Eruh Criminal Court of First Instance sentenced Zana
Aksu, a conscientious objector and former director of the Human Rights
Association's (IHD) Siirt branch, to 18 months' imprisonment and a fine
of 10,000 TL (€700) for "desertion". The case was pending before the
Diyarbakır Regional Appeals Court at the end of the year. Zana Aksu had
previously been convicted on the same charge in 2018 and acquitted in a
separate case in 2020 on the grounds of double jeopardy.

Freedom of expression

In April, the ECtHR ruled that the rights to freedom of expression and
to liberty and security of journalist Ahmet Altan had been violated. The
following day, the Court of Cassation overturned the verdict but ordered
his immediate release based on the excessive length of his imprisonment.
The verdict for his co-defendant, Nazlı Ilıcak, was also overturned.
Their case was returned to the lower court for retrial. In December, the
ECtHR similarly found that Nazlı Ilıcak's rights to liberty and security
and freedom of expression had been violated.

In September, a Diyarbakır court sentenced human rights lawyer Nurcan
Kaya to a suspended sentence of one year and three months' imprisonment
for "making propaganda for a terrorist organization" concerning a tweet
about the Islamic State siege of Kobani in 2015.

In October, the Malatya court sentenced Kurdish writer and Kurdish Pen
member Meral Şimşek to one year and three months' imprisonment for
"making propaganda for a terrorist organization", relating to her
writings, the awards she received and the content of wiretapped
conversations. In July, Meral Şimşek had been tortured and violently
pushed back by Greek border forces.

In October, in the landmark decision Vedat Şorli v Turkey, the ECtHR
found that Article 299 of the Criminal Code, which criminalizes
insulting the president, was incompatible with the right to freedom of
expression, and urged the government to align the legislation with
Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Human rights defenders

In January, [the Istanbul Regional Appeals Court overturned the February
2020 acquittals of Osman Kavala and eight other civil society figures in
the Gezi Park trial]{.underline}. In February, [judicial authorities
merged Osman Kavala's prosecution for "attempting to overthrow the
constitutional order" and "espionage" with the Gezi Park prosecution for
"attempting to overthrow the government".]{.underline} In August, it was
further decided to merge these combined prosecutions with the retrial in
the unrelated Çarşı case, in which 35 football supporters were
prosecuted for their alleged participation in the 2013 Gezi Park
protests. [Although all 35 had been acquitted in December 2015, in March
the Court of Cassation overturned the acquittals, recommending the
merger of the case with the Gezi Park trial. I]{.underline}n December,
the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers formally notified Turkey
of its intention to initiate infringement proceedings for its failure to
comply with the ECtHR judgment to release Osman Kavala.

In February, [[human rights lawyer]{.mark} and defender Eren
[Keskin]{.mark} was [sentenced to six years and three months]{.mark}'
imprisonment for "membership of a terrorist organization]{.underline}"
in the Özgür Gündem newspaper trial, for participating in a solidarity
campaign. The case was pending appeal at the end of the year.

The retrial of Şebnem Korur Fincancı and Erol Önderoğlu for their
one-day editorial support of Özgür Gündem restarted in February after
their 2019 acquittals were overturned on appeal.

In March[, Öztürk Türkdoğan, co-chair of the IHD, was arrested during a
police raid in his home on suspicion of "membership of a terrorist
organization]{.underline}". He was released the same day with judicial
control measures.

In March, [the prosecutor at the Court of Cassation issued his opinion
asking for the conviction of Taner Kılıç, the former Chair of Amnesty
International Turkey, to be upheld without justification, while
requesting that the convictions of Özlem Dalkıran, Idil Eser and Günal
Kurşun be overturned]{.underline}. The case was pending before the Court
of Cassation at the end of the year.

In September, Raci Bilici, former chair of the IHD's Diyarbakır branch,
was retried after the Regional Appeals Court overturned his conviction
in December 2020. The Diyarbakır court again sentenced Raci Bilici to
six years and three months' imprisonment for membership of a terrorist
organization. The case was pending on appeal at the end of the year.

In October[, human rights defender Mehmet Selim [Ölçer]{.mark} was
[sentenced to two years]{.mark} and one month's imprisonment for
"supporting a terrorist organization]{.underline}" based on his
membership of the Diyarbakır-based Sarmaşık Association[, a civil
society organization fighting against poverty]{.underline} which was
closed down by executive decree in 2016.

The trial of three police officers and an alleged member of the armed
PKK accused of killing human rights lawyer Tahir Elçi continued in
Diyarbakır. The officers faced charges of gross negligence manslaughter.

Women's and girls' rights

On 20 March, by presidential decision, [[Turkey withdrew]{.mark} [from
the Council of Europe Convention]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [combating and
preventing violence against women and domestic
violence]{.mark}]{.underline} (Istanbul Convention), depriving women and
girls of a vital instrument of protection from all forms of violence,
without discrimination. The announcement coincided with a surge in
domestic violence cases during the Covid-19 pandemic, and sparked
countrywide protests. The withdrawal entered into force on 1 July.
[According to independent women's rights organizations, 280 women were
killed during the year as a result of gender-based violence and 217
women were found suspiciously dead.]{.underline}

LGBTI people's rights

[In a tweet in January, the minister of interior referred to four
Boğazici University students as "LGBT perverts]{.underline}". He was
commenting on the students' arrest in relation to a campus art
exhibition depicting a religious site with symbols of the LGBTI
community.

In March, [the government attempted to justify the withdrawal from the
Istanbul Convention by claiming that the Convention was instrumentalized
to "normalize homosexuality" a]{.underline}nd that this was
"incompatible with Turkey's social and family values".

Freedom of assembly

[Police used unnecessary and excessive force while detaining hundreds of
students during peaceful assemblies protesting at the presidential
appointment of Professor Melih Bulu]{.underline} as rector of Boğaziçi
University. At least 11 students were remanded in pretrial detention and
31 others put under house arrest, along with hundreds subjected to
judicial controls and prosecutions for violating the Law on Meetings and
Demonstrations. Seven students faced prosecution on charges of "inciting
the public to enmity and hatred", and prison sentences of up to three
years in relation to the Boğazici campus exhibition. By the year's end,
two students had been remanded in pretrial detention for protesting
against the new rector who replaced Melih Bulu in August.

In March[, the trial began of 46 individuals, including human rights
defenders, political activists, journalists, and relatives of victims of
enforced disappearances dubbed the "Saturday
Mothers/People."]{.underline} The defendants faced charges under the Law
on Meetings and Demonstrations for refusing to disperse during their
700th weekly vigil on 25 August 2018. The case remained pending.

Seventeen women participating in the Night March marking International
Women's Day on 8 March were detained and later released under judicial
control measures for "insulting the president" and violating the Law on
Meetings and Demonstrations. In August, an Istanbul court accepted the
indictment requesting that each receive up to eight years' imprisonment.

In April, the gendarmerie responded with tear gas to a protest by
villagers in İkizdere, in the province of Rize, against the decision to
open a stone mine in the village which they argued would destroy the
environment and pollute drinking water. Some villagers were detained and
later released. Protests continued despite banning orders by the Rize
Governorship.

In June, [the annual Istanbul Pride march was banned for the sixth
consecutive year. Police used unnecessary and excessive force to
disperse protesters and detained at least 47 people, including the
journalist Bülent Kılıç]{.underline}. All were released later that day.
The first hearing in the prosecution of eight protesters under the Law
on Meetings and Demonstrations was held in November.

After two years on trial for taking part in a Pride march on campus, 18
students and one academic at the Middle East Technical University in
Ankara were acquitted in October. The prosecutor appealed against the
decision. The case was pending appeal at the end of the year.

Freedom of association

The [new Law on the Prevention of the Financing of the Proliferation of
Weapons of Mass Destruction negatively affected the work of civil
society organizations]{.underline}. In October, [the Financial Action
Task Force added Turkey to its "grey list" for increased
monitoring.]{.underline} It cited **[[Turkey's]{.mark} [failure]{.mark}
to address serious deficiencies [in its efforts to combat money
laundering]{.mark} and financing terrorism, [including]{.mark} its
[failure to apply a risk-based approach to supervision of the
not-for-profit sector]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

In June, the Constitutional Court accepted the indictment by the Chief
Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation requesting the closure of the HDP
and a five-year political ban for its 451 executives and members. The
HDP was accused of becoming the focus point of actions contrary to the
state's integrity, based on criminal prosecutions and convictions
against 520 individuals under overly broad anti-terrorism laws.

#### Extradition and arms sales concessions from NATO over Sweden and Finland undermine the counterplan.

Hypocrisy on Human Rights Enters New Low." News 18. July 2, 2022.
https://www.news18.com/news/opinion/as-nato-capitulates-before-turkey-western-hypocrisy-on-human-rights-enters-new-low-5477755.html.\]

Amid the Russia-Ukraine war, Sweden and Finland are all set to join the
Nato alliance overcoming a major hurdle. [Sweden and Finland's Nato bid
was nearly torpedoed by Turkey, a Nato member itself, which used its
veto powers to block their entry]{.underline}. Now, however, **[Turkey
has lifted the veto but only after imposing humiliating conditions on
the two Nordic nations]{.underline}**.

Nato members are in a celebratory mood ever since this "breakthrough"
but tough questions are catching up because in reality, the [Nato
meeting in Madrid and the three-way deal signed by the Nordic nations
and Ankara, simply reaffirmed the fact that the West is ready to kneel
before the rogue Nato member that has no love lost for its peers in the
alliance]{.underline}. Wildly [inappropriate concessions have been made
to win over the Erdogan-led regime in Ankara by self-appointed guardians
of human rights and democracy]{.underline}. **[Kurdish dissidents have
been thrown under the bus to fulfil Nato's expansionist
agenda.]{.underline}** To simplify, the bellicose regime of President
Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been handed over a major diplomatic and
strategic victory on a platter. To add to that, **[Sweden will be
lifting its arms export embargo on Turkey, and the United States has
expressed a newfound willingness to cater to Turkey's demands for the
F16 aircraft]{.underline}**, after nearly four years of what was seen as
a silent, unannounced embargo.

President Erdogan's office stated that **[Turkey "got what it wanted"
from Sweden and Finland]{.underline}**. And indeed, it did. A look at
the signed document--- a loosely worded submission, with a clear bent in
Turkey's favour, shows how Sweden and Turkey folded with the blessings
of the United States and other Nato members.

"As prospective NATO Allies, [Finland and Sweden extend their full
support to Turkey against threats to its national
securit]{.underline}y," the trilateral agreement said. "To that effect,
[Finland and Sweden will not provide support to the
YPG/PYD,]{.underline} and the organization described as FETÖ in Turkey,"
it went on.   Most notably, [Sweden and Finland have agreed to "address
Turkey's pending deportation or extradition requests of terror suspects
expeditiously and thoroughly]{.underline}." This is where the two
prospective NATO allies have made a highly unpopular promise to Ankara,
given that [Sweden has over 100,000 Kurdish people and nearly 16,000
Kurds reside in Finland. Among them are refugees fleeing persecution,
dissidents and important political figures who have escaped hostile
regimes of Iraq, Syria and Turkey.]{.underline}

This, however, does not mean that Turkey will not demand more
concessions in the weeks to come.   Soon after the agreement was signed,
[Turkey announced that it would now push for the extradition of 33
"terror suspects"]{.underline}. And while this concessions-laden
agreement is not legally binding, **[Turkey is expected to test the
commitments of the two Nordic states and can still scuttle their Nato
entry until they are formally inducted]{.underline}**. [Erdogan has
already announced that he could still torpedo their entry if they fail
to implement the deal.]{.underline} "If they fulfil their duties, we
will send it (their application) to the parliament. If they are not
fulfilled, it is out of the question,\" said the Turkish President.
Naturally so, the worries of the Kurdish diaspora in Sweden and Finland
are not misplaced.

Just as Sweden and Finland decided to shun neutrality and join Nato,
much to Russia's chagrin and to the satisfaction of the West, [Turkey
played spoilsport and vowed to scuttle their prospects citing their
support to Kurdish groups in Northern Syria which are currently fighting
off occupational Turkish forces]{.underline}. [Turkey faces a Kurdish
insurgency largely near its southern border led by the PKK which is seen
as a terrorist organisation by Turkey]{.underline}. In Kurdish lands
beyond, especially in northern Syria, [groups like the US-backed YPG and
their political affiliates have enjoyed the support of the political
establishments in Sweden and Finland. It is to be noted that Kurdish
militias in Syria bravely kept ISIS on its toes and were crucial in
ensuring the terror machine's defeat]{.underline}. They also [developed
alliances with the US and other Western powers in this
pursuit.]{.underline} Divided among Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran, and
facing persecution as minorities, the Kurds have long demanded their own
state, giving birth to political and armed movements across Kurdish
lands.

Seen as a rogue outlier in Nato, [Turkey found and acted upon the
opportunity to get the West to support its military operation in
northern Syria]{.underline}. Turkish forces and alleged mercenaries
occupy parts of this region. [A vast array of human rights abuses was
reported during the peak of its military intervention and Ankara faced
condemnation from the Western world]{.underline}. All major NATO members
including Germany, France, UK and Canada have refused arms sales to
Erdogan's Turkey. Tensions further escalated when Turkey stepped up its
belligerence towards fellow Nato member Greece in the eastern
Mediterranean and the West largely backed Athens through this tussle.
[The list of Turkey's excesses can go on, but the West has decided to
overlook all that now]{.underline}. [US President Biden's own stance on
Turkey used to be one of admonishment. Today, that seems to change with
Ankara's new leverage in the game.]{.underline}

The West also shares the grouse that [Turkey has not joined in on the
sanctions spree on Russia and is instead helping Russia evade sanctions
by allowing troubled Russian oligarchs to park their money in Turkey's
economy]{.underline}. But this has also taken a backseat for now.

What's worse is, [the persecution of the Kurds in Turkey, who comprise
almost 20% of its population, has also been conveniently overlooked this
time around]{.underline}. **[Turkey rejects the cultural and political
rights of the Kurds and has spent most of the last century denying the
existence of Kurds]{.underline}**, even labelling them "mountain Turks"
in 1980 and banning words like 'Kurds' and 'Kurdistan'. In fact, [Turkey
has been repressing Kurdish rebellions for over two
centuries.]{.underline} Akin to the genocide of Armenians, Kurds have
been massacred and expelled from their villages throughout recent
history.

Just this year, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Turkey
violated the freedom of expression of lawmakers from the pro-Kurdish
political party by stripping them of their parliamentary immunity from
prosecution. All these concerns seem to have evaporated into thin air as
the US-led Nato endorses Sweden and Finland's concessions to Turkey. The
Western world and brazen hypocrisy are no strangers, but this new low
really takes the cake.

[The **assault on human rights** and **the rule of law** presided over
by Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan continued during the Covid-19
pandemic.]{.underline} [The president's Justice and Development Party
(AKP) and an allied far-right party enjoy a parliamentary majority
enabling them to **consolidate authoritarian rule** by passing rushed
legislation that contravenes international human rights
obligations.]{.underline} Opposition parties remain sidelined under
Turkey's presidential system and the government has reshaped public and
state institutions to remove checks on power and to ensure benefits for
its own supporters. The political opposition nevertheless controls the
municipalities of Istanbul and Ankara.

[Executive interference in the judiciary and in prosecutorial decisions
are entrenched problems, reflected in the authorities' systematic
practice of detaining, prosecuting, and convicting on bogus and
overbroad terrorism and other charges, individuals the Erdoğan
government regards as critics or political opponents. Among those
targeted are journalists, opposition politicians, and activists---in
particular members of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party
(HDP).]{.underline} The largest targeted group consists of those alleged
to have links with the movement headed by US-based Sunni cleric
Fethullah Gülen which Turkey deems a terrorist organization and calls
FETÖ and holds responsible for the July 2016 coup attempt.

Turkey's move to begin gas exploration in the East Mediterranean in the
context of maritime boundaries contested with Greece and Cyprus almost
spiraled into a naval clash with Greece in August. The European Union
has made efforts to broker dialogue over conflicting claims in a dispute
originally ignited by the discovery of gas reserves off Cyprus with its
contested status.

Turkey provides military support to the United Nations-recognized
Government of National Accord in Libya against a breakaway government in
the east of the country. Turkey has expressed strong support for
Azerbaijan in its conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh. [Turkey
continues to exert effective control via Syrian non-state actors over
areas of northern and northeast Syria where it has intervened militarily
in the past four years, and where significant human rights abuses
continue unabated]{.underline}. Turkey cites its aim as removing Kurdish
forces formerly controlling the area closely linked to the armed
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) with which Turkey has been engaged in a
decades'-long conflict (see Syria chapter). Turkey played a key role in
securing a March ceasefire in Syria's northwestern Idlib governorate,
which has largely held.

Freedom of Expression, Association, and Assembly

[Most TV and print media in Turkey are owned by companies close to the
Erdoğan presidency or avoid reporting critical of the
government]{.underline}. Critical online news and commentary websites
persist, nevertheless. At the time of writing, an estimated 87
journalists and media workers were in pretrial detention or serving
sentences for terrorism offenses because of their journalistic work.

Plans for strict regulation of social media companies in Turkey were
made law in July after President Erdoğan used the example of insults
against his family on social media to justify a need for stricter
regulation. Under the new law, social media companies with over one
million users a day will be required to have offices in Turkey and
comply with government demands to block and remove content or else face
very heavy fines. Companies that do not open an office will be fined and
eventually have their bandwidth restricted, rendering the platform
unusable. At time of writing, Facebook had indicated it would not comply
with the law.

While Turkey in January lifted a blocking order on Wikipedia in place
since April 2017, authorities continue to block thousands of websites,
including critical news websites, and order the removal of online
content.

[Thousands of people face arrest and prosecution for their social media
posts, typically charged with defamation, insulting the president, or
spreading terrorist propaganda]{.underline}. In the context of Covid-19,
the Interior Ministry announced that hundreds of people were under
criminal investigation or detained by police for social media postings
deemed to "create fear and panic" about the pandemic. Some of these
postings included criticism of the government's response to the
pandemic.

Turkey's official media regulation authority, the Radio and Television
Supreme Board (RTÜK), ordered arbitrary fines and temporary suspensions
of broadcasting of media outlets such as Halk TV, Tele 1 TV, and Fox TV,
which include content critical of the government. Netflix complied with
RTÜK's April demand that it remove an episode of TV drama series
Designated Survivor on the grounds that it offered a negative portrayal
of President Erdoğan, as well as in July canceling filming in Turkey of
a new Turkish drama after RTÜK requested the removal of a gay character
from the script.

[Selectively using Covid-19 as a pretext, provincial governors banned
peaceful protests of women's rights activists, healthcare workers,
lawyers, and political opposition parties.]{.underline}

Terrorism charges continue to be widely misused to restrict the rights
to free expression and association in the fourth year after the coup
attempt. As of July 2020, Ministry of Justice and Interior figures
stated that 58,409 were on trial and 132,954 still under criminal
investigation on terrorism in cases linked to the Gülen movement. Of
those 25,912 were held in prison on remand.

There are no published official numbers of prisoners held on remand or
convicted for alleged links with the PKK, although on the basis of the
previous years' figures the number is at least 8,500 and includes
elected politicians and journalists. An April law on early prisoner
release to reduce crowding in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic
excluded remand prisoners and all prisoners detained or convicted of
terrorism offenses. Covid-19 cases have been reported in prisons
throughout Turkey, although authorities do not provide numbers of
confirmed cases.

Human Rights Defenders, Lawyers

In February, an Istanbul court acquitted rights defender Osman Kavala
and nine others of "attempting to overthrow the government by force and
violence" in connection with the 2013 mass protests which began in Gezi
Park. However, hours after his acquittal another court ordered Kavala's
detention in the scope of an investigation into his alleged role in the
July 2016 attempted coup. In October, the investigation culminated in
another bogus indictment accusing Kavala and US academic Henri Barkey of
attempting to overthrow the constitutional order and espionage. Kavala
has been detained since November 2017, with Turkey flouting a European
Court of Human Rights' judgment ordering his release on the grounds that
his detention has been pursued for political aims.

In July, in a case against human rights defenders detained in 2017 while
they attended a training workshop, an Istanbul court convicted Taner
Kılıç, Amnesty International Turkey's honorary chair, on charges of
membership of a terrorist organization to over six years in prison. İdil
Eser, Amnesty Turkey's former director, and rights defenders Özlem
Dalkıran and Günal Kurşun received sentences of 25 months on charges of
aiding a terrorist organization, and 7 others, 2 of them foreign
nationals, were acquitted. All are at liberty and the case is under
appeal.

The government's restrictive approach to the public activities of
lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights groups continued
with the banning of events including Pride marches for a sixth year
running and homophobic speeches by senior state officials.

[The government in July passed a new law to reduce the institutional
strength of Turkey's largest bar associations, which have strongly
criticized Turkey's backsliding on human rights and the rule of law.
Defense lawyers representing defendants in terrorism prosecutions have
faced arrest and prosecution on the same charges as their
clients]{.underline}. In September, the Court of Cassation upheld the
conviction of 14 out of 18 lawyers for links with an outlawed leftist
organization. One of the lawyers, Ebru Timtik, died on August 27 after a
prolonged hunger strike in demand of a fair trial.

The first hearing against three police officers and a PKK militant
accused of the fatal shooting of human rights lawyer Tahir Elçi on
November 28, 2015, began in October with further hearings postponed
until March 2021.

From May to July, at least 45 Kurdish women's rights activists were
detained and face prosecution for links with the PKK. Femicide and
domestic abuse are significant problems in Turkey. While official
disaggregated data on numbers are not available, women's rights groups
have reported that hundreds of women are killed annually as a result of
domestic violence. Conservative groups and some government officials
suggested Turkey may withdraw from the Council of Europe Convention on
Preventing and Combatting Violence against Women and Domestic Violence
(the Istanbul Convention), which Turkey was among the first to ratify in
2014.

#### Torture, police brutality, and poor prison conditions undermine human rights

**[Torture and Ill-Treatment in Custody, Enforced
Disappearances]{.underline}**

[A rise in allegations of torture, ill-treatment, and cruel and inhuman
or degrading treatment in police and military custody and prison over
the past four years has set back Turkey's earlier progress in this
area]{.underline}. Those [targeted include people accused of political
and common crimes]{.underline}. [Prosecutors do not conduct meaningful
investigations into such allegations and there is a pervasive culture of
impunity for members of the security forces and public officials
implicated.]{.underline}

There have been no effective investigations into the around two dozen
reported cases of enforced disappearance over the past four years. In
February and June 2020, two men out of six who resurfaced in police
custody in Ankara months after disappearing in February 2019, stated in
court hearings that they had been abducted, tortured, and forced to sign
statements confessing to links with the Gülen movement.

In June, the government passed legislation to increase the numbers and
powers of night watchmen who assist the police with community policing
functions, granting them authority to stop and check IDs and to use
lethal force. There have been reported instances of watchmen abusing
their powers and ill-treating people.

The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) has conducted
three visits to Turkey since the July 2016 coup attempt. In August, the
Turkish government granted permission for publication of two of the CPT
reports from 2017 and 2019 visits identifying ill-treatment in police
custody and degrading conditions and overcrowding in prisons.

Kurdish Conflict and Crackdown on Opposition

[While sporadic armed clashes between the military and the armed
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) occur in Turkey's eastern and
southeastern regions, the focus of the conflict is in the Kurdistan
Region of Iraq, where Turkey conducts regular cross-border operations
and airstrikes against PKK targets, in some cases killing and injuring
civilians.]{.underline}

[The Erdoğan government refuses to distinguish between the PKK and the
democratically elected Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP)]{.underline}
which won 11.7 percent of the national vote in the 2018 parliamentary
elections and 65 local municipalities in the 2019 local elections.
Former party co-chairs Selahattin Demirtaş and Figen Yüksekdağ have been
in detention since November 2016. Turkey has refused to comply with a
2020 European Court of Human Rights ruling that Demirtaş should be
immediately released.

Since August 2019, the Interior Ministry has justified the removal of 48
elected Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) mayors on the basis that they
face criminal investigations and prosecutions for links with the PKK.
Repeating the approach taken in 2016-17, the government has replaced
mayors in the southeast with Ankara-appointed provincial governors and
deputy governor "trustees."

At time of writing, 19 mayors remain in pretrial detention. In March, a
Diyarbakır court sentenced Adnan Selçuk Mızraklı, the dismissed mayor of
Diyarbakır Metropolitan Municipality, to over nine years in prison based
on a witness statement accusing him of links with the PKK. The case is
under appeal. In October, an Ankara court ruled for the pretrial
detention of Kars mayor, Ayhan Bilgen, and 16 other HDP officials, in
connection with an investigation into their alleged role in 2014
protests.

In June, the Turkish parliament revoked the parliamentary seats of two
HDP deputies, Leyla Güven and Musa Farisoğulları, on the grounds that
the Court of Cassation had upheld convictions against them for
membership in a terrorist organization, and Enis Berberoğlu, a deputy
from the main opposition Republican People's Party, for revealing state
secrets by sharing video footage of trucks of weapons being transferred
to Syria with Cumhuriyet newspaper.

In June, an Istanbul appeal court upheld the conviction of Canan
Kaftancıoğlu, Istanbul chair of People's Republican Party (CHP), to
nearly 10 years in prison for tweets she made years ago. A further
appeal is underway.

Refugees and Migrants

Turkey continues to host the world's largest number of refugees, around
3.6 million from Syria, and over 400,000 refugees and migrants from
Afghanistan, Iraq, and other countries. On February 27, 2020, Turkey
announced that authorities would not intercept asylum seekers wishing to
leave Turkey through its borders with the European Union.

As a result, thousands of migrants and asylum seekers gathered at the
Turkish-Greek border. Many of those that managed to cross the Evros
River into Greece were summarily and violently pushed back by Greek
security forces. The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic prompted Turkey to
close the border again, but attempted crossings by migrants of land and
sea borders and pushbacks from Greece continued.

At least 60 Afghans and others died after entering Turkey from Iran and
crossing Lake Van in the eastern part of the country in a fishing boat.
The border with Syria has been closed to new asylum seekers since 2016;
Turkish border guards have killed or injured some of those attempting to
cross and carried out mass summary pushbacks.

#### Strained relationship with US prevents modeling and cooperation

Key International Actors

[Turkey's relationship with the European Union was strained by tensions
in the East Mediterranean over contested maritime borders and access to
gas reserves, as well as by Turkey's willingness to use migration as a
political bargaining tool]{.underline} by briefly opening its border to
Greece in February-March. [Turkey formally remains a candidate for EU
accession without expectation on either side of progress towards its
membership.]{.underline}

In its Turkey report in the context of the accession process, the [EU
Commission stressed the "continued deterioration of democracy, the rule
of law, fundamental rights and the independence of the judiciary ...
with further backsliding in many areas."]{.underline} The EU made a
number of statements on negative developments, criticizing in February
the re-arrest of Osman Kavala, and in July, the conviction of rights
defenders including Taner Kılıç.

[Turkish-US relations remain strained for multiple reasons, including
the presence on US soil of Fethullah Gülen, US support for Kurdish-led
forces in Syria, Turkey's acquisition of Russian S-400 missiles, and the
forthcoming New York trial of a state-owned Turkish bank for Iran
sanctions-busting and money laundering]{.underline}.

In June and October, Istanbul courts convicted two local employees of
the US consulate in Istanbul on terrorism charges, imposing prison
sentences ranging from five to nearly nine years because the employees
had prior professional contact, years earlier, with police officers
later accused of being Gülenists.

In a February report, the [Council of Europe Commissioner for Human
Rights focused on measures by authorities that have had "devastating
consequences" for judicial independence and "unprecedented levels of
disregard for the most basic principles of law" in terrorism
prosecutions.]{.underline} Following the review of Turkey's human rights
record by UN member-states in the context of the Universal Periodic
Review, [Turkey rejected core recommendations regarding its human rights
record or claimed that it had already implemented them.]{.underline}
