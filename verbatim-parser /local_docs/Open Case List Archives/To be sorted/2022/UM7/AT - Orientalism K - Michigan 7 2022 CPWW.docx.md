**[Orientalism is false]{.underline}**

**Attempts to label Orientalism as an effect of [all]{.underline} powers
takes away from the true origin -- modern Europe, which used
[anthropocentrism]{.underline}, [knowledge]{.underline} and
[liberalism]{.underline} to dominate nature to throw the world into
modernity.**

WH: To answer your question, I want to begin with the blurb's statement
that [Restating Orientalism is concerned with "re-evaluating,"
"deepening," and "extending" the critique of Orientalism.]{.underline}
Let me begin with the last of the trio, "extending," but let me insert a
caveat first. At one level, I could not even begin to extend [Said's
critique]{.underline} when he, [like almost every scholar]{.underline}
engaged in such matters, [applies the term indiscriminately, almost to
any idea or person writing about anything Islamic, Asian or African.
Said erroneously thought that Orientalists are to be found everywhere,
from ancient Greece to thirteenth century Latin scholars,
to]{.underline} von Grunebaum, Bernard Lewis and their likes in [the
twentieth century]{.underline}. So it is not true that I extend the
critique in any of these directions. If anything, in fact, [I limit its
diachronic scope]{.underline}, I reign it in, [and refuse to accept its
sweeping historical coverage. **[There was no Orientalism before
modernity]{.mark},** not even in the high cultures of antiquity who,
according to Said, were also "racist." \[...\] I may even counter by
deploying an equally categorical statement: "[No matter how ethnocentric
and]{.mark} how [dominating pre-modern empires all were, **none could
wed knowledge to power and redefine ethics as our modern empires did
and**]{.mark} **continue to [do]{.mark}."**]{.underline}

But how do I extend the critique, which I in fact do? [First, in order
to show why it is a modern phenomenon, [I deepen]{.mark} the
[exploration]{.mark} into the genealogy of modern knowledge in order [to
excavate]{.mark} a [structure of thought that is -- as a hegemonic
structure \-- unprecedented in human history.]{.mark} Second, [because
this structure is]{.mark} a [foregrounding]{.mark} structure, [it
obviously did not just sit under]{.mark} the field of [Orientalism
alone. If the structure foregrounds modern thinking and ways of
living]{.mark} in the world, [then it radiates onto all
disciplines]{.mark}, especially the ones formed by this structure as
paradigms.]{.underline} This is the accurate meaning of "expanding the
critique" in the blurb. [I see engineering, economics, business schools,
journalism, law schools, mainstream philosophy, science,
medicine]{.underline}, and a host of others [as being epistemologically
structured in the same manner]{.underline} in which Orientalism was
fashioned. [The major difference]{.underline}, from this perspective,
[is the substantive content of each discipline. Orientalism is the most
obvious field for the study of the other, even more so than
anthropology, and it is here, in Orientalism, where **racism,
manipulation, control, domination, and sovereignty** show themselves
most obviously.]{.underline}

[My argument]{.underline}, furthermore, [is also that showing and
[practicing sovereignty over a Hindu or a Muslim in Asia is
not]{.mark}]{.underline} very [[different from]{.mark} showing and
[exercising sovereignty over a tree or a river in]{.mark}]{.underline}
the forests of [[Peru or Ecuador.]{.underline}]{.mark} I call [[each
instance an epistemological "genetic slice"]{.mark}]{.underline} where
the [[totality of such]{.underline}]{.mark} instances [[amounts to a
unique but structured modern attitude]{.mark}]{.underline} toward the
world. [[Said]{.mark} navigated at the political level of racism,
pejorative language, and exoticizing the Orient, but [could not
see]{.mark} that what is involved in the [production of Orientalism
was]{.mark} nothing short of [a deeper, underlying structure of thought
from which he could not extricate his own thought.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[**[To critique Orientalism is to critique secular humanism, liberalism,
anthropocentrism, materialism, capitalism]{.mark}** \-- all of which,
and more, Said took for granted.]{.underline}

FF: What is the relationship between 'the west', modernity, knowledge
and power? Could you elaborate on the relationship between orientalism
and colonialism?

WH: I think [it is [important to understand]{.mark} that [modernity is
not a continuous trajectory with what preceded]{.mark} it. Modernization
theory]{.underline} continues unabated in almost every academic field.
This theory, foundational to writing and making history, [operates
on]{.underline} the assumption of what I have labelled a [["theology of
progress."]{.underline}]{.mark} The theology is [founded on the
[assum]{.mark}ption that [time has a homogeneous teleological
structure]{.mark}, that this [structure is inevitable, and]{.mark} that
the [earliest phases of history were preparatory for]{.mark} the
[later]{.mark} ones, [which were in turn]{.mark} simply the [means to
reach]{.mark} the [intended summit of real human progress: Western
modernity]{.mark}. Integral]{.underline} to this understanding [is that
no]{.underline} culture or ["civilization" outside of and prior to
modern Europe possessed the same validity, competence, and moral and
intellectual development. [Whatever]{.mark}]{.underline} these
civilizations had possessed of [[value]{.underline}]{.mark}, culturally
or otherwise, [[was]{.mark} [consumed]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
process of [[preparing for a higher goal]{.mark}, outside and beyond
themselves. [The goal was Western modernity]{.mark},]{.underline} which
was [[imposed]{.underline}]{.mark} on the world [[by colonialism,
coercion, and hegemony]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Even if we]{.mark} were to [concede]{.mark}---[however objectionable
and repugnant]{.mark} this may be--- that [modernity's violent
tools]{.mark} were [adopted by necessity]{.mark} with a view [to
improv]{.mark}ing [the human condition, we]{.mark} find ourselves
[fac]{.mark}ing the [bitter reality of a world in which we have
destroyed almost everything around us]{.mark}, from communal and social
structures to ecology and environment.]{.underline}

What many do not seem to understand is that [all this is [integral to
modernity]{.mark} as a particular project, [as a particular epistemology
which has dictated a particular set of practices, all of which are the
work of]{.mark} a particular subject, [a particular
subjectivity]{.mark}]{.underline}. My argument is that [[modernity's
structure of thought created a novel relationship between man and
nature]{.underline}]{.mark}, one [[that produced]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[pathological]{.underline}]{.mark} sense of [[domination over nature,
including our own.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Colonialism did not start in the colonies, but in Europe itself, and
this is because [early modern Europe embarked on a quest in which
**knowledge was systematically harnessed to subjugate nature, including
our own selves.** **Orientalism is nothing more than a strand of
discourse by which this bleak result was achieved, but every branch of
knowledge**]{.mark} -- philosophy, science, law, etc.-- **is [equally
involved]{.mark}** in the same project. That [modernity now is
everywhere]{.mark} in the world [should not hide]{.mark} the fact of
[its European origins.]{.mark}]{.underline} The reader is advised to
read the book for a detailed account of how all this happened.

**Orientalism is only regarded as dangerous by those who don't know
enough about it, Said's book is riddled with vengeful bias, and the
theory provides incentives for not considering Asian scholarship.**

**Owen 12** \[Owen, Roger, Roger Owen is the A.J. Meyer Professor of
Middle East History at Harvard University and was previously the
Director of the university's Center for Middle Eastern Studies.,

East Institute,
https://www.mei.edu/publications/edward-said-and-two-critiques-orientalism\]//AA

And so it has been ever since. [**[Orientalism]{.mark}** often continues
to be [regarded as **dangerous**]{.mark}, perhaps in particular [by
those who have **never** read it.]{.mark}]{.underline} Hence, the
intense, ludicrous, alarming and, I would hope, unique way in which the
field of modern Middle Eastern studies has become polarized between the
followers of Edward Said and those of Bernard Lewis and, now between
those belonging to the Middle East Studies Association (MESA) and its
newly-created rival, the Association for the Study of the Middle East
and Africa (ASMEA). [Given the fact that this **"dangerous person"**
Edward Said appeared well-versed, if not in the social sciences then in
post-structuralism and in what was soon to become post-colonial studies,
meant that the motley band of persons identified as Saidians could all
be tarred --- regardless of what they actually said, regardless of what
they actually taught --- with the same brush as being purveyors of
[politically motivated]{.mark}, trendy, and **[ideologically dangerous
gibberish]{.mark}**. Such is the [**meretricious** message]{.mark}
which, **[without]{.mark}** much **[elaboration]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark}
without any obvious [mental effort, remains]{.mark} as
**[potent]{.mark}** with some audiences as it did 30 years
ago.]{.underline} It also is worth noting that [[the **personal
tone**]{.mark} of the book helped to [make things]{.mark} even
[worse]{.mark}. The author himself, his reasons for writing the book,
[his **genuine offense**]{.mark} at the way [Arabs and Muslim are
objectified in]{.mark} such [a **reductionist** way]{.mark}, is
powerfully present in the text.]{.underline} He names names --- Bernard
Lewis' in particular. And [certain passages are more easily read as
political and polemical rather than as scholarly and academic, even if
this was almost certainly not Edward's original intention.]{.underline}
All this has had unfortunate consequences. [[Critics]{.mark} use the
personal and the political to [muddy the waters]{.mark}, not only of
Edward's critique itself but also [of anyone who can reasonably]{.mark},
or unreasonably, [be associated with it.]{.mark} Hence [it provides a
reason for **not** taking the work of a huge number of scholars of the
Middle East with the academic respect it deserves, even when]{.mark}, as
in the case of most social scientists at least, [their work has]{.mark}
little or [**nothing** to do with **Orientalism**]{.mark}, either in
praise or blame.]{.underline} By the same token, [[it allows those
who]{.mark} still [practice]{.mark} some version of an [Orientalist
approach to **insulate** themselves]{.mark}, and their students,
[from]{.mark} a powerful, [alternative, point of
view.]{.mark}]{.underline} More seriously, [the ad hominem attacks on
Said and his band of alleged Pied Pipers also make it more difficult to
sustain an attack on the role of Orientalists in authorizing certain
aspects not only of American military and security policy but those of
Israel as well.]{.underline} For all the books that castigate the malign
influence of the State Department Arabists, none to my knowledge point
to the policy impact of Israeli Orientalists as well as to the fact
that, even in Israeli terms, their close association with the country's
defense establishment has been counter-productive to what might be
described as the country's national interests. Think of expert
authorities like Gabriel Baer, who assured me, in the mid-1970s, that
Egypt would never make peace with Israel. Think of those who created and
managed the Palestinian "village leagues." Think of those who supported
policies to encourage Hamas during the first Intifada. Think of those
who argued that the Shi'a population could be lured into playing an
anti-PLO, anti-Syrian role in South Lebanon. [[Bad Orientalism
**encourages** the notion that the **enemy** of my **enemy** is my
**friend**.]{.mark} Bad [Orientalism]{.mark}, paradoxically, though
based on the concept of a certain Middle Eastern timelessness,
[authorizes]{.mark} ambitious [schemes]{.mark} of political and social
engineering [based on **short-term** considerations while
**lacking**]{.mark} any way [of **anticipating** unexpected long-term
**consequences**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

WH: My short answer is a resounding Yes. [I think that the
[position]{.mark} which argues [that one cannot critique modernity from
within modernity---necessarily the only place in which we find
ourselves--- is]{.mark} a [nihilistic]{.mark} one.]{.underline} It is
[[both historically and epistemologically untenable]{.mark}.
Historically, because every piece of evidence points to the undeniable
fact that]{.underline} systems and cultures and ["civilizations" are not
only in constant change, but]{.underline} they [come and go. Modernity
came at the heel of European Christendom, just as Islam came at the heel
of Persian and Byzantine empires, and Greece before it displaced
Pharaonic Egypt and Phoenicia. Each one of these "civilizational
constellations" was epistemologically and culturally
unique]{.underline}, each with a particular way of seeing the world.
[**[To say that modernity is the end of history is sheer
foolishness.]{.mark}** Epistemologically, because our forms of knowledge
have done us a great deal of disservice. To say the least, we have
destroyed the very Earth we live on, our home, and this is because we no
longer know who we are.]{.underline}

So the question is [[how do we]{.mark} go about [exit]{.mark}ing this
situation?]{.underline} In Restating Orientalism and \[my\] new book to
appear next year, Reforming Modernity , [I argue]{.underline} that [[our
only hope is]{.mark} to [develop]{.mark} what I call an **[external
critique]{.mark}**, which **[does not mean]{.mark} that [we can speak
from outside modernity]{.mark}.** To speak from within modernity is
inescapable.]{.underline} In my earlier The Impossible State, [[I
developed]{.mark} the concept of [central and peripheral domains, both
of which must exist in all cultures and "civilizations."]{.mark} For
example, [in modernity]{.mark}, the [state, capitalism, bureaucracy, and
a particular form of reason have become central domains]{.mark} that
govern all other domains. These central domains [have formed our
subjectivities, and made us who we are]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} My
argument is that [[we can capitalize on the peripheral domains,
through]{.underline}]{.mark} an act of [[heuristic
retrieval]{.underline}]{.mark}, in order [[to displace the central
domains]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [[ethics is one peripheral
domain]{.underline}]{.mark} from which [[we can begin to rethink who we
are]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the time and space we have here,
[[I]{.mark} [cannot]{.mark}]{.underline} of course [[tell you what the
details]{.underline}]{.mark} and modalities [of this project [are,
but]{.mark}]{.underline} the three works [[I]{.underline}]{.mark} have
referred to above [[begin this continuing project.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**Orientalism is a flawed and contradictory theory**

**Landlow 7**[(George P Landlow, Oct 23 2007, \"Edward W. Said\'s
Orientalism,\" Professor of English and Art History, Brown University,
http://www.postcolonialweb.org/poldiscourse/said/orient14.html)**//BRownRice**](file:///C:\Users\rishishetty\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\(George%20P%20Landlow,%20Oct%2023%202007,%20%22Edward%20W.%20Said's%20Orientalism,%22%20Professor%20of%20English%20and%20Art%20History,%20Brown%20University,%20http:\www.postcolonialweb.org\poldiscourse\said\orient14.html)\BRownRice)

Drawing upon the methods of feminist criticism of the 1970s, [Said\'s
[Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline} did much to create the field of
postcolonial studies by teaching us to \"read for the gap,\" placing
texts in broad political contexts. Despite its obviously valid points
about weaknesses of Euro-American thought, its appeal for Western
intellectuals, and its liberating effect on intellectuals from former
countries that were colonized, this seminal book [[has]{.mark} some
[major flaws]{.mark}:]{.underline} Though enormously effective as a
polemic, [Orientalism is [very shoddy as scholarship]{.mark}, and yet it
presents itself as a corrective to flawed scholarship. [The book]{.mark}
completely [neglects China, Japan, and South East Asia]{.mark}, and it
has very [little to say about India]{.mark}. Although purporting to be a
study of how the West treats all of the East, the book [focuses almost
entirely upon the Middle East]{.mark}. Its [generalizations about \"the
Orient\"]{.mark} therefore [repeat]{.mark} the very [Orientalism]{.mark}
it attacks in other texts!]{.underline} It is bizarrely forgiving of
French Orientalist writers like Nerval and Flaubert. [Orientalism is an
[orientalist text several times over]{.mark},]{.underline} and in two
ways [commits the [major errors]{.mark} involved with the idea of the
Other]{.underline}: First, it assumes that such projection and its
harmful political consequences are something that only the West does to
the East rather than something all societies do to one another. (I am
surely not the only teacher who has had heard Asian-American students
returning from their parent\'s country of origin exclaim, \"Everything
Said says the West does to the East, the East does to the West!\")
[Because Orientalism is apparently [based on very little knowledge of
the history of]{.mark} European and Non-European [imperialism]{.mark},
it [treats Western colonialism as unique]{.mark}. This point, like the
previous one, makes perfect sense if one takes Said\'s pioneering book
largely as a political polemic, for in that case such omissions might be
forgivable. One expects more from criticism and scholarship,
particularly politically motivated criticism and
scholarship.]{.underline} Although greatly influenced by feminist
criticism and theory, [Orientalism almost completely [neglects gender
matters]{.mark}. Although [emphasizing]{.mark} the way the [West
sexualizes the East]{.mark}, it also tends to [repeat]{.mark} the
[pattern]{.mark}, and, moreover, its generally favorable treatment of
French orientalization suggests a great insensitivity to such
issues,]{.underline} For many scholars, [one of Orientalism\'s most
offensive claims was its [dramatic assertion that no European or
American scholar could \"know\" the Orient and that,]{.mark} moreover,
all scholarly [attempts to do so]{.mark}]{.underline} (except Said\'s
own) [always [constituted]{.mark} acts of
[oppression]{.mark}.]{.underline} In a single dramatic move, which had
great appeal for many, Said committed the greatest single scholarly sin:
he silenced others by preventing them from taking part in the debate.
According to Said, if someone knew Persian or Tamil grammar, the history
of Islam or Hinduism, or the societies of Saudi Arabia, Eygpt, or
Bangladesh, he or she already belonged to the devil\'s party. They were
corrupted by what Said defined as Orientalism. For Said, who studied
literature at Princeton and Harvard, this proved a very convenient
tactic, since he knew very little about these alien fields. Indeed, one
of the bitterest charges directed at him was that in his own Orientalist
ignorance of the actual Middle East, Said himself in effect suppressed
important work by Egyptian and Arabic scholars! [Whatever liberatory or
other benefits [Orientalism]{.mark} might have offered upon its
appearance, it has [harmed literary studies]{.mark} and literary
students. By focusing exclusively on the political valences of literary
texts, it has very little to offer those also interested their literary
or aesthetic dimensions. Even those with little interest in such
non-political themes have been harmed by the school of thought
Orientalism has fostered: its political argument, which first enriched
familiar texts, impoverishes when it leads to a neglect of literary and
rhetorical technique. (Note: Said does not himself argue against
acquiring such skills, but those who follow him often do.)]{.underline}
Even if all these charges were true (and I believe they are), Said\'s
Orientalism remains a major work. Why do you think this is the case? How
is the book larger than the local conditions in which it was produced?
Why do the book\'s strengths, rather than its weaknesses, appear far
more important to a scholar working in, say, Morocco, Singapore, or
India?

**Orientalism is a myth that perpetuates the rhetoric that people of the

The **[[myth of Civilization v. Barbarism]{.underline}]{.mark}** (also
known as the \"new barbarism thesis\"\--see Richards, 1996) and its
variations **[[are an outgrowth of]{.underline}]{.mark}** the third
aspect of the myth of **[[American]{.mark}
[Exceptionalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**: America represents the forces of
good against evil**[. This [myth is a classic story of \"Us versus
Them\"]{.mark}]{.underline}** that [[favors cultural or civilizational
explanations]{.mark} [for]{.mark} [conflict]{.mark} over political or
economic ones.]{.underline} The myth\'s central dichotomy **[[appeals to
identity and makes it powerfully]{.mark}
[intuitive]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Linguists and anthropologists have
noted that language has a binary structure wherein almost every noun,
adjective, and verb has a direct opposite. Generally, one term has
positive connotations while the other does not, and using one term
brings to mind its value-opposite. This underlying architecture of
**[[language is relevant]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the study of this
myth, [**[because it means that]{.mark}** either
word]{.underline}\--**[[civilization or
barbarism]{.underline}]{.mark}**\--**[[alone can conjure the larger body
of work on myth]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If a speaker talks about the
\"triumph of civilization[,\" it can be understood that (good)
civilization is triumphing over (bad) barbarians]{.underline} (Jackson,
2005). Thus, [words that have clear opposites]{.underline}\--for
example, justice, western, evil, freedom, and hate\--**[[are]{.mark}
[especially powerful lexical triggers of political
myth]{.mark}.]{.underline}** According to Cap (2005),

The present formula of social communication in the US demonstrates a
striking proportion of language which portrays reality in terms of a
necessary division into \"two,\" which the latter usually means
different and opposing. Such a stance is hence expected of politicians,
and non compliance is scarcely tolerated\--President Bill Clinton \...
got under a massive wave of criticism for being \"too conciliatory\" in
his 1997 State of the Union Address, (p. 14)

This sheds light on the groundwork and intuitive appeal of Civilization
v. Barbar ism. Huntington\'s 1993 thesis, The Clash of Civilizations,
and Barber\'s (1992) Jihad vs. McWorld are reified traces of work on
this myth. **[Today, Civilization v. Barbarism acts as a classic story
of \"Us versus Them]{.underline}**,\" in which a **[[politically and
culturally civilized western world is defined in opposition to a violent
and barbaric eastern world]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Edward
**[Said]{.underline}** (1978) [drew attention to this construct
in]{.underline} his famous book, **[[Orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
The lasting influence of Rafael Patai\'s (1973) book The Arab Mind is an
especially relevant example of (neo-)Orientalism. Patai claimed that
**[[psychological and cultural factors intrinsic to the \"Arab mind\"
account]{.mark} for what he described as [the violence, stagnation, and
backwardness of Arab populations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Such
(neo-)Orientalist explanations for violence have **[[served as a sort of
pseudo scientific alibi for the Civilization v.]{.mark} [Barbarism
myth]{.mark}]{.underline}**, illustrating the sometimes porous boundary
between myth and scientific theory.

Certainly, **[[rhetoric of the time accessed this myth]{.mark} in order
[to legitimize and justify acts of genocide]{.mark}]{.underline}**
against Native Americans throughout the eighteenth century. In fact,
William McKinley\'s secretary of state, John Hay, combined the third com
ponent of American Exceptionalism with Civilization v. Barbarism when he
described the Indian wars as \"the righteous victory of light over
darkness \... the fight of civilization against barbarism\" (qtd. in
Judis, 2005, p. 55). **[[Cold War rhetoric also conveyed the myth of
Civilization v. Barbarism,]{.mark} and Reagan\'s rheto ric in particular
used the language of \"good versus evil]{.underline}**.\" As the
discourse and practice of the Cold War reveals, [the significance of the
[conflict]{.mark} between the United States and the Soviet Union [went
far beyond politics and economics]{.mark}]{.underline}; it was
understood that a Godless \"**[[evil]{.mark} [empire\" was
threatening]{.mark} our way of [life]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Implicit in
the Nixon-Khrushchev Kitchen Debate was the idea that the encroachment
of the Soviet Union would threaten the commodity-rich lifestyles of
average Ameri cans. The discourse around the threat of Communism was
largely an exercise in axiological proximization, whereby the evil
ideology of the enemy was conveyed as encroaching on everything we know
to be good and right. Because of the ideological nature of the Cold War,
We and They could not be reliably defined by geopolitical borders; so
**[[the myth]{.mark} of Civilization v. Barbarism [served as a
discursive compensation for blurred boundaries]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

George H.W. Bush\'s public opinion polls and focus groups showed that
the **[[public found]{.mark} [rhetoric emphasizing]{.mark} axiological
[considerations]{.mark} [such as the \"evil\" deeds of Saddam Hussein to
be more compelling]{.mark}]{.underline}** in justifying the Gulf War
[than rhetoric emphasizing economic reasons]{.underline}, such as jobs
and oil (Rottinghaus, 2008). Thus, **[the [legitimization effect of
\"good versus evil\" rhetoric is widely
acknowledged.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**Orientalism isn't that great of a book**

Orientalism", 3/3/22, Medium,

Accessed 7/16/22)//mackerel

[Orientalism is and was known as a controversial work.]{.underline} I
can't comment on scholarly criticism with regard to Saïd's inferences
made from 18th/19th and 20th-century writers, which may or may not
sometimes have been incorrectly interpreted or cited. Regardless, [there
was undeniably some sort of representation constructed and reproduced in
literature and by policymakers that had clear racist undertones and was
embedded in a strong sense of Western superiority. There are [several
issues with Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [beginning with
[Saïd's **problematic understanding of
rep**]{.mark}**resentation[s]{.mark}**. [The Self vs. Other
concept]{.mark} is pretty straightforward]{.underline}, namely that
along the passage of time and increasing contacts with and knowledge of
other peoples, human societies have felt the need to define themselves
in opposition to a fictional Other. [This [has become a Manichean
relationship in which the Self is dependent in its own construction on
its representation of the Other.]{.mark}]{.underline} For example, ['we
are civilized because they are barbaric' or 'we are good because they
are evil'. [Saïd criticizes Orientalism as a discourse that has
inadequately represented the Orient and thereby constructed and
reaffirmed the high notions Western cultures had/have about themselves.
In itself, this argument is well-grounded]{.mark} in a review of
centuries of Western colonial literature, conquests, and
political/economic domination. But [Saïd isn't]{.mark} necessarily
[concerned with]{.mark}]{.underline} the problems of [[colonialism. As
stated by himself: The Arab world today is an intellectual, political,
and cultural satellite of the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates. This is not in itself something to be
lamented; the specific form of the satellite relationship, however, is.
[[Saïd's overriding concern]{.mark} is with an [incorrect]{.mark}, and
[therefore unjust, representation of this Arab world. He decries]{.mark}
the ["degradation of knowledge" and implores]{.mark} his [readers to
accept]{.mark} that their [conception of the Middle East/Orient]{.mark}
is [distorted by constructed rep]{.mark}re[s]{.mark}entations. [He urges
them to expand their knowledge]{.mark} in order [to decrease]{.mark}
(and [perhaps **ultimately break**]{.mark}]{.underline} out of) [[this
distortion]{.underline}]{.mark} of knowledge. [What [he is]{.mark},
seemingly, [not concerned with]{.mark} is: (1) [how a changing cultural
representation of the Orient Other would necessarily impact the
representation of the Western Self; (2) how the Orient has represented
itself vis-à-vis the West]{.mark}; Saïd claims there is a clear
imbalance in the number of works produced in the West on the Orient
versus the number of workers produced in the Orient on the West, and one
cannot really speak of a self-representation or at the very least a
counterweight in that regard; [(3) the question whether some sort of
representation is inevitable. In the theoretical case a representation
of the Other would be entirely 'native' and just, would an Other still
exist? And would You as a Self continue to exist?]{.mark}]{.underline}
As Saïd himself touches upon, an arbitrary division has been made on a
variety of artificial categories such as race, which has led to the
removal of the universality of humanity. By returning to a state of
universal humanity, the fabric of societies might be argued to unravel.
People have cared beyond their own family about their community
precisely because they have been able to identify with it and in
opposition to others. [While an understanding of other cultures is
necessary and essential, some sort of representation to fit these
cultures within one's own framework appears necessary in order to
continue human societies as we know them. Without a Self vs. Other
cultural representation, humanity would in its universality return to a
family clan-based organization. Or, in other words, it would continue a
Self vs. Other representation but now simply based on
bloodlines.]{.underline} Orientalism, moreover, boils down to the dictum
power is knowledge. This is not unique to Western representations of the
Orient, of course, and would extend to every historic relationship in
which one culture has exercised political and economic hegemony over
another and thereby repurposed representations of the other culture.
Saïd merely touches upon this broad application of his critique on
cultural representations, failing to see the broader implications and
applications of his writing. [After all, Orientalism addresses a small
circle of academic readers]{.underline} who, for example, are assumed by
Saïd to be already well-versed in etymological discussions of the Arabic
word tahwra. [[Saïd's main goal, in the end, appears to be]{.mark} the
[awakening]{.mark} of [Orientalists who fail to see]{.mark} that [their
body of knowledge]{.mark} on the Orient [is **constructed rather
than**]{.mark} **an [accurate]{.mark} representation**. [He is writing
for an Occidental audience who can read vast quotations in French and
have intimate knowledge of obscure Orientalists. He is not interested in
any Oriental readers.]{.mark} Saïd published his work in English and
didn't author its later Arabic translation. He also makes no reference
to Oriental representations of itself and the Occident, and ways in
which they might have been constituent for Orientalism itself. The
[adoption of Orientalism as]{.mark} a [postcolonial critique]{.mark} is
therefore **[clearly a remaking and incorrect representation]{.mark}**
of Saïd's personal and academic intentions and his writing. [Saïd is not
out to tilt the balance of power]{.mark} in favor of the colonized,
**[he merely intends to make the colonizer understand his colonized
object better.]{.mark}** He explains how through philology, in
combination with other disciplines, representations of the Other/Orient
were imbued by racism. Yet [for all his detailed descriptions of the
clear racism and exploitation of the Orient by the West, Orientalism is
no scathing critique of racism, colonialism, or imperialism. Following
the publication and subsequent popularity of his work, Saïd and his
readers have remade his work to represent such a
critique]{.mark}.]{.underline} Note for example the most popular quote
of the book on Goodreads: "Every single empire in its official discourse
has said that it is not like all the others, that its circumstances are
special, that it has a mission to enlighten, civilize, bring order and
democracy, and that it uses force only as a last resort. And, sadder
still, there always is a chorus of willing intellectuals to say calming
words about benign or altruistic empires, as if one shouldn't trust the
evidence of one's eyes watching the destruction and the misery and death
brought by the latest mission civilizatrice." This quote isn't from the
original edition of Orientalism published in 1978 but is penned down by
Saïd in his preface to the 25th-anniversary edition, in 2003. Its
anti-imperial/colonial tone is something Saïd actively eschewed in his
original work. One can only speculate to the reason (fear of reputation
damage in an already close-knit community of academics? Failure to
escape from his own Western education?), but it is clear that by 2003
Saïd had remade himself into an advocate of postcolonialism and critic
of the West (although he rejects the notion still in 2003 that his book
is anti-West). But besides Saïd himself, who now is even considered "a
founder of postcolonialism", Orientalism has been remade by its readers
as well into a postcolonial critique. [Through the fact it has been
simplified and reduced to a mere few sentences in academic teaching, but
also through its readers who were especially offended or inspired by its
slimmer of revolt against and renunciation of the West and reframed the
book in turn through the emotions evoked. If anything, [this
remaking]{.mark} of Orientalism itself [is a vivid display of the way in
which a search for scientific objectivity and an uncovering of "truths"
is bound to be rendered into repr]{.mark}e[s]{.mark}entations [of this
reality. Orientalism]{.mark} as such, [as]{.mark} examined and [argued
by Saïd, is a reflection of this unavoidable reality of
repr]{.mark}e[s]{.mark}entations. [One should always be conscious of
knowledge being framed and interpreted through various lenses and
contexts and attempt to limit this distortion as much as possible, yet
also be aware of the boundaries of]{.mark} this exercise for
['truth'.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**Orientalism as a theory is full of flaws and contradictions**

**Elif notes 4/11**(Elif Notes, 04-11-2022, \"Edward Said's Orientalism:
Various Flaws and Weaknesses,\" ElifNotes,
https://elifnotes.com/edward-saids-orientalism-flaws-and-weaknesses/)**//BRownRice**

Edward Said's Orientalism is his signature contribution to literary
criticism and academic life. The book questions a pattern of
misrepresentation of the Orient (East) by the Occident (West). It argues
that there had never been a neutral scholarship that studied the Orient.
This is because those who were doing the study belonged to the West.
This fact exercised colonial power over those being studied. This
unequal power relation created the very object of study. It means 'we'
could study 'them' because 'they' were separated from 'us' and subject
to 'our' rule. The evaluation and critique of Edward Said's set of
beliefs, known as 'Orientalism', forms a significant background for
postcolonial studies. Besides, it has also given birth to a new
sub-discipline---the cultural study of colonialism. However, Edward
Said's [[Orientalism has various]{.mark} [flaws]{.mark} and weaknesses
as well.]{.underline} Various literary theorists, anthropologists,
historians, and political scientists have often cited as well as
criticized it. However, it received [[strong criticism from]{.mark}
academic Orientalists, including some of [Eastern
background]{.mark}.]{.underline} Edward Said's Orientalism made a
[parenthetical statement that 'the world is made up of two [unequal
halves, Orient and Occident']{.mark}.]{.underline} This statement
presents a useful summary of the binary opposition he creates.
Nevertheless, here Said acknowledges the obvious opposition of Orient
and Occident. Whereas, at various stages in the text, he complicates the
issue. [He [refers to Orient]{.mark} both [in opposition to]{.mark} that
which is ['Western' and]{.mark} also that which is ['European']{.mark}.
At the same time, [neglecting]{.mark} its already established natural
[antonym]{.mark}.]{.underline} Some [[Major Drawbacks of Said's Binary
Distinction]{.mark} Between the Orient and the Occident]{.underline} The
[dualistic [definition of]{.mark} the [Occidental half]{.mark} of the
binary by Edward Said [causes a]{.mark} great
[problem]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is obvious that he uses the two terms
apparently interchangeably. Yet, [despite the overlapping of definition
to some extent, the lack of true synonymy between 'European' and
'Western' shows that it is no longer explicit what Said is suggesting
the Orient (East) to be defined in opposition against.]{.underline}
Since this binary construction is crucial to Said's theory, if it is
improperly explained or seems indistinct, [the whole theory [raises
doubt.]{.mark} Said's [binary distinction]{.mark} between the Orient and
the Occident further [becomes doubtful by]{.mark} his discussion of the
[commonality of German]{.mark} Orientalism, [American]{.mark}
Orientalism, [and Anglo-French Orientalism]{.mark}. By naming them
separately, and in therefore [acknowledging]{.mark} a [difference as
well as]{.mark} a [commonality between the three]{.mark}, Said opens up
the possibility of the existence of multiple Orientalisms rather than a
single unified system of Western thought, which he elsewhere defines
Orientalism as being.]{.underline} This concession to divisions within
European thought, and further, between European and American thought,
highlights the problems of trying to discuss and theories such large
terms as Europe and Western. Moreover, Said discusses the problem he
claims every writer on the Orient faces. These problems, in his views,
are: "how to get hold of it, how to approach it, how not to be defeated
or overwhelmed by its sublimity, its scope, its awful dimensions".
However, at the same time, he appears faced with similar problems of the
sublimity, scope and dimensions of his terms as he discusses the
Occident. EDWARD SAID'S ORIENTALISM: DEFINITION, SUMMARY & ANALYSIS
[Fractured Unity of Occidental Models in Edward Said's
'Orientalism']{.underline} As the unity of Edward Said's Occidental
models fractures, his [binary system breaks down yet further. The
[central binary distinction]{.mark} between the Occident and the Orient
becomes [increasingly complex]{.mark}. For, it [becomes]{.mark} more
[apparent that]{.mark} while we can define Europe and the West in
relation to their differences with the Orient, so can we similarly
define the West's component parts in relation to their differences with
each other. In this way, the binary opposition upon which Said's
premises his theory is problematic because he has [defined]{.mark} it
[poorly]{.mark}.]{.underline} Moreover, Said theory also appears
doubtful because of the reductive nature of the terms he uses. Such
reductive tendencies are not only present in his discussion of
Europe/the West/the Occident. They also appear to the same degree in his
discussion of the Orient. In addition, while Said acknowledges the
geographical span of the Orient, "which extended from China to
Mediterranean", and has already discussed the perils of sublimity in
writing about the Orient, he nevertheless still seems to forget the
cultural and societal span this sweeping labelling of 'the East' takes
in, and continues to talk about the Orient as a single sublimed entity.
Edward Said's Orientalism Theory: [Overshadowed by Improperly Defined
Concepts]{.underline} Although Edward Said acknowledges Orientalism as
'a Western style'. However, he seems to [fall too easily into line with
the western thought he critiques. He does so by [delineating the Orient
as a holistic unit]{.mark} because of its exoticism and its '[otherness'
to the West]{.mark}, instead of any commonality of features within
itself. [By not seeking enough to]{.mark} define and [question]{.mark}
the concepts and [labels]{.mark} he uses in his discussion, [Said falls
victim to their reification]{.mark}.]{.underline} This eventually makes
Edward Said's [Orientalism theory [overshadowed by concepts]{.mark} that
he [fails to define properly]{.mark} and [gain control
over]{.mark}.]{.underline} Also, this evidence seems to [indicate the
necessity of a [number of different binaries to]{.mark} fully
[construct]{.mark} the complex system of [interrelationships]{.mark}.
These interrelationships are between the various acting nations and
people in this discourse, rather than one simple distinction of the West
and the East.]{.underline} READ BRIEF SUMMARY OF EDWARD SAID'S
ORIENTALISM [[Major Flaw]{.mark} in Said's Claim about the Orient's
Silence]{.underline} As we've discussed, [Said's often sweeping and
reductive nature is explicit to an extent in his [problematic use
of]{.mark} the [terms around which his argument revolves]{.mark}.
Another example of such a generalizing tendency in Orientalism appears
in his suggestion that: "[Orientalism]{.mark} is [premised upon
exteriority]{.mark}, that is, on the fact that [the Orientalist]{.mark},
poet or scholar, makes the Orient speak, [describes the Orient]{.mark},
renders its mysteries plain for and to the West". [Another central
aspect]{.mark} of Said's theory [is that]{.mark} the [knowledge]{.mark}
gained about the Orient from representations of it in literature, is
[crucial to t]{.mark}he [power the West]{.mark} held over it. In his own
words: "Knowledge of the Orient, because generated out of strength, in a
sense creates the Orient, the Oriental, and his world". However, we can
see such writers such as]{.underline} William Jones, Warren Hastings,
Robert Southey, William Hodges as [Said]{.underline} describes. That is,
to speak for the Orient, and thus, to create it in the minds of their
readers. While, theirs are not the only representations of the Orient
that exist. Often cited as an Indian author's first text in English, The
Travels of Dean Mahomet (1794) is quite significant in this regard. An
autobiographical book , it is an instance of the exception of Said's
generalized rule of exteriority. [Its production and existence is
[enough to dispute Said's claim about the Orient]{.mark} being spoken
merely from the outside---the West.]{.underline} Mahomet's work clearly
defies Said's convention. It is an explicit example of a description of
the Orient, rendering its mysteries plain and clear for the West, not
written by an external 'Orientalist', a European poet or scholar
travelling in the East. However, its author is an Indian writer who has
travelled in and emigrated to Europe. Edward Said's Orientalism Theory:
Based Upon A Generalized & False Assumption [Therefore, Edward Said's
Orientalism theory seems based upon a generalized and a false assumption
that 'such an Orient was silent'.]{.underline} Although very much in the
minority, the existence of Mahomet's text rejects Said's notion of such
silence. The book further reveals that [it is [not]{.mark} the [imperial
eyes' that solely created the Orient]{.mark}. However, the
[representations of the East by the Eastern people also played a role in
its creation.]{.mark}]{.underline} Nevertheless, Mahomet is not simply
an Indian writer who offers a simple refutation of Said's claim of
exteriority. Instead, since he migrated to Europe, Mahomet is a hybrid
figure, as culturally English as he is ethnically Indian. Similarly, his
text is a hybrid. Other European Orientalist texts seem to influence it
in style and possibly in content. Yet, it is also different due to his
different view of events. Although Mahomet's text doesn't base on
exteriority to the Orient to the same degree as works by contemporaneous
writers, neither can seem the work of a completely Oriental insider. It
shows that there are certain complexities surrounding Mahomet's location
as a writer. Therefore, his work's example cannot completely disprove
Said's claim of Oriental exteriority. However, it does highlight the
fact that there are elements to Said's Orientalism that he
oversimplifies and doesn't explore as fully as he might have done. For
Said to claim that "Orientalism is premised upon exteriority" is as
reductive in its own way as the earlier problems surrounding his
definition of the binary opposition of the Orient and the Occident. This
is because it is without examination of a character like Dean Mahomet or
other recourse to evidence and examples. Conclusion As I've demonstrated
in the above argument, Edward Said's Orientalism theory has certain
flaws and weaknesses. However, in spite of these flaws and weaknesses,
there is a also testament to the importance of Said's work. That is, it
provoked such criticism and debate nearly two decades after its
publication.

**Orientalism is too totalizing of a theory and doesn't allow us to
learn about the Middle East**

Romanticised but not out of contempt \... The Snake Charmer by Jean-Léon
Gérôme A woman wraps a giant snake around her nude form as north African
men in a picturesque variety of costumes look on in J-L Gérôme\'s 19th
century painting The Snake Charmer. She stands on a Turkish carpet; the
entire scene is permeated by sexy blue light reflected off a tiled wall.
This is the \"orient\" as imagined by a 19th-century European. You can
see why Penguin in the 1980s chose it as a cover image for the paperback
of the critic Edward W Said\'s famous book Orientalism. [The
[appositeness of Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}, first published in
1978 and one of the most influential books of the last 30 years, [[to
the present]{.mark} moment [is obvious]{.mark}. Writing at a much
earlier stage in America\'s relationship with the Islamic world, Said
analysed what he claimed to be certain enduring structures of western
thought about the \"orient\". These structures were established by
European intellectuals in the 19th century - he argued - and taken up in
the 20th by American scholars. The Orient]{.underline}, he suggests,
[was a lurid fiction of otherness that afforded westerners a valuable
territory of fantasy and desire]{.underline} - as Tate Britain\'s
exhibition, The Lure of the East: British Orientalist Painting, which
opens on June 4, will surely illustrate. [And yet, this [western
fascination was in no sense humanising]{.mark}. Orientalism, he argues,
produced not real understanding but knowledge that was power: the racist
claim to omniscience summed up by one of his chapter headings, \"Knowing
the Oriental\".]{.underline} Advertisement Let me be frank. I think
[[Orientalism is more than just a bad book]{.mark}. It is a bad book
that [legitimates bad politics]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is a [[great
wedge of dishonesty that has begat a great mountain of
ignorance]{.mark}. It is a treason of the clerks, an intellectual fraud
that [justifies bigotry and hatred.]{.mark}]{.underline} Said\'s book
[licenses the claim that any and all statements by westerners about the
Middle East can be dismissed as worthless and racist. [Anything a
European says]{.mark}]{.underline} about a range of subjects from the
Pyramids of Giza to the stories of Sinbad the Sailor to the nature of
Islamic art [can be [assumed]{.mark} from the start by readers of
Orientalism to be [orientalist]{.mark} - or latterly,
Islamophobic.]{.underline} In fact, the very writers and scholars
analysed by Said tell a different story. One of the first works of
Orientalism that he discusses is the vast Description of Egypt, ordered
by Napoleon and researched by a team of French scholars whose work was
eventually published in a series of monumental volumes by 1828. From
this staggering work, Said quotes no more than a paragraph of its
preface. In this one paragraph, he finds evidence that Napoleon\'s
scholars saw Egypt as a theatre of colonial power. In fact, the
paragraph, itself fairly anodyne, looks irrelevant when you examine the
Description as a whole with its meticulous drawings of stingrays and
snail shells and careful records of engineering machinery used to pump
water from the Nile, ploughing techniques, and costumes. Can all this be
lumped together as one colossal discourse about a fictional Orient? Was
Napoleon saying Egyptians were like fish? Advertisement [The real story
here]{.underline}, that Said reveals against his intentions, [is the
[remarkable fact that Europeans]{.mark} and Americans [in the 19th
century knew more about]{.mark} the cultures of [the Middle East than we
do now.]{.mark}]{.underline} They read the Tales of the 1001 Nights and
dreamt of the Alhambra. [Was this just a complacent Imperialist
celebration of power, based on the contrast between nostalgia for the
great Oriental past and contempt for the Arab present? No, I think there
was real curiosity and admiration. But where has it gone? [Today the
west is bleakly incurious about]{.mark} the history of [Islam]{.mark},
its art, peoples and learning. There\'s a [blank wall of terror]{.mark}.
This wall has been [strengthened by Said\'s book]{.mark} because it
[closes down a crucial way for cultures to encounter one
another]{.mark}: it closes down [romanticism]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
first time I visited Granada and walked through the stucco-laden,
tile-glistening rooms of the Alhambra, I had no doubt this triumph of
medieval Moorish architecture was the most beautiful building I had ever
seen. I also reached quite naturally for \"orientalist\" metaphors to
describe it to myself - in short, I felt like I was riding on a magic
carpet. I still think that\'s a reasonable way to evoke in words the
feeling of lightness the Alhambra creates. To see - and love - Islamic
art in this way is not a style of contempt. [It is not patronising. [It
is not racist,]{.mark} and it is the very opposite of Islamophobic. In
censoring such longings, [Said\'s book]{.mark} has for 30 years helped
to [ensure that white Europeans]{.mark} and Americans [become]{.mark}
progressively more [ignorant of the Islamic world]{.mark}. It is a
modern classic - of fear and loathing.]{.underline}

**[AT: Orientalism- Said's"Ideal type"]{.underline}**

**Said's narrative of Orientalism contains a damaging paradox in which
he seeks to reject typification of "the orient" yet himself typifies
European civilization as an "Ideal Type", an agent of Orientalism
creating an essentialist simplification**

Sara R. **Farris 10**\[Sara R. Farris, Senior Lecturer in Sociology at

The 'whole **[[impulse to classify nature and man into
types']{.underline}]{.mark}** (Said 2003: 119), **[[for Said, was one of
the elements that prepared the way for modern Orientalist
structures]{.underline}]{.mark}**. 'In natural history, in
[anthropology, in cultural generalization,]{.underline} **[a type had a
particular character which provided the observer with a
designation]{.underline}** and, as Foucault says, "a controlled
derivation"' (ibid.). Said goes on to **[[list such designations: 'the
wild men', 'the Europeans', 'the Asiatics']{.underline}]{.mark}** and so
on. The practice of **[[classification]{.mark}, as Said recognized[,
became crucial to sciences]{.mark}]{.underline}**, both natural and
social. However, in the field of the social sciences and humanities it
resulted in the assembly of human/cultural types, thus producing
stereotyped images of cultural collectivities. As we have seen, [Said
acknowledged that Max **[Weber\'s ideal]{.mark}** types played a central
role both **[in shaping the ways in which classification was employed by
European]{.mark}** -- **[but also North American]{.mark}** **[-- social
sciences and in]{.mark} [assembling non-western cultures and individuals
into Orientalized types]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

**[[Said]{.underline}]{.mark}** was thus very insightful when he
**[[recognized a certain instrumental]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
summational function of the **[[notion of the ideal
type.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Its main problem and dangerousness, for
Said, lay in the nature of the ideal type itself, as a way of
simplifying and naturalizing the Other (especially the Oriental Other)
as an articulation of a geographical, historical and sociopolitical
entity with immutable traits. He also recognized the pervasiveness of
this notion in contemporary intellectual work. As he writes, 'still,
th**[e [notion of a type]{.mark} -- Oriental, Islamic, Arab, or whatever
-- endures and [is nourished by similar kinds of abstractions or
paradigms]{.mark} or types [as they emerge out of the modern social
sciences']{.mark} (]{.underline}**Said 2003: 61, my italics).

The characteristics of ideal types as **[the modalities and the outcomes
of conceptualization and classification]{.underline}** proper to social
sciences are the result of Weber\'s epistemological presuppositions.
Ideal types express Weber\'s neo-Kantian conception of the relationship
between reality and knowledge in which the former is a meaningless
infinity in constant change, to which human beings give their own
meanings, and the latter is the rigorous, disciplined capacity of the
scientist to put some order in this chaos. **[[The ideal
type]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[a conceptual construct which is
neither historical reality nor even the 'true'
reality]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is even less fitted to serve as a
schema under which a real situation or action is to be subsumed as one
instance. It has the significance of a purely ideal limiting concept
with which the real situation or action is compared and surveyed for the
explication of certain of its significant components. (Weber 1949: 93)

The ideal type thus appears as a 'telescope' or a 'yardstick' (Mommsen
1974) **[[used in order to comprehend reality.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Within Max Weber\'s comparative studies on world religions, the method
of the ideal type functions as a tool for the '**[[conceptualization'
and 'classification' of different social
phenomena]{.underline}]{.mark}** by means of focusing upon a specific
point of view, or 'perspective angle'. Thus Weber applied it in his
historical comparative studies in order to classify religious
prescriptions regarding economic activity into 'types of economic
ethics', and came up with a typification of different societies as those
geoculturally and geopolitically unified constellations that Said
criticized as essentialist and stereotyped.

Each of Weber\'s studies on Weltreligionen thus leads to the
**[[formulation of types of 'civilizations' that in the end seem to be
assumed as uniform and static]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As a result, as
many subsequent critics have emphasized, the variables 'time' and
'history' are cancelled from these unifying/essentializing ideal types
(Fischoff 1944; Robertson 1933). Even Parsons had to admit that Weber
'tended to treat typical motives ... as rigidly unchangeable entities
\[and\] used ideal types to atomize his material into rigid units which
could only be combined and recombined in a mechanistic way or absorbed
into higher-order patterns' (Parsons 1963: lxiv).

Said, on the other hand, although he does not offer such an extensive
methodological reflection as Weber, refers explicitly to Foucauldian
concepts of discursive formations in methodological terms. Nonetheless,
**[[several criticisms]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the same kind as those
addressed to Weber\'s ideal types **[[have also been made of Said\'s
multifaceted definition of Orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Clifford
1988; Porter 1994). The tendency towards [a certain semantic **[shifting
in his definition of Orientalism]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the
**[association between very different authors who belonged to very
different countries]{.mark}** and epochs are aspects of Said\'s work
that have been criticized]{.underline} precisely because of a certain
ultimate disregard for the variable 'history'. As Porter has argued,
'\[**[[Said\] fails to historicize adequately the texts he cites and
summarizes, finding always the same triumphant discourse where several
are frequently in conflict']{.underline}]{.mark}** (1994: 160).

We could go further by noting many more similarities between Said\'s
discourse and Weber\'s ideal type. [**[Orientalism shares with Weber\'s
notion of the ideal type]{.mark}** the one-sided viewpoint of departure
and focus that [implies the choice of what aspects or objects can enter
into the definition]{.mark}]{.underline} (or class). Thus, Said chose to
focus on British, French and American Orientalism, while leaving aside
other writings. Like Weber\'s ideal type[[**, Orientalism** tries to
view with the same 'telescope' centuries of history and the most
disparate writings and authors**, thus often risking annihilating
history and dehistoricizing the object of
investigation**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Similarly, Weber and Said share an
attitude of beginning the classification with the purpose of providing a
historical account of the object under investigation (namely, the origin
of the spirit of capitalism in Weber, and the origin of Orientalism in
Said), thus attempting to find its starting point. In a further moment,
however, this point is then lost in the beginning of human history. In
Weber it was to be the sixteenth century of the Reformation, but then
became the beginning of rationalization in its march from pre-Christian
history right up until the disenchantment of the world in Protestant
Europe. In Said, Orientalism at one stage is the discourse constructed
'politically, sociologically, militarily, ideologically, scientifically
and imaginatively during the post-Enlightenment period' (Said 2003: 3)
and then progressively goes back to the Middle Ages with Dante Alighieri
and then to that virtual place that Said calls 'imaginative geography',
which makes us set arbitrary boundaries according to a 'universal
practice of designating in one\'s mind a familiar space which is "ours"
and an unfamiliar space beyond "ours" which is "theirs"' (53--9).

In the end, and at a more substantial level, **[[the central similarity
between Weber\'s ideal types of Oriental civilizations and Said\'s ideal
type of Orientalism lies in their very content]{.underline}]{.mark}**:
in their geopolitical and geocultural 'nature' as immutable and
determining traits. The mere fact of belonging to them affects ideas,
cultural and intellectual practices and identities. We might recall that
[**[by 'Orientalism' Said means]{.mark}**, among other things, 'European
culture' and '**[Western style for dominating, restructuring, and having
authority over the Orient']{.mark}**]{.underline} (Said 2003: 3). Thus
the Orientalist discourse belongs to 'Europe' and the 'West' as
autonomous entities, and it ends up being the ideal type of the attitude
adopted by westerners towards the Orient, in a pure geocultural,
crystallized fashion. Said\'s (and several postcolonials') [[tendency to
**treat Orientalism as a geographical and 'civilizational'
entity**]{.mark}]{.underline} has been brilliantly highlighted by
Fernando Coronil (1996) and Neil Lazarus (2002). The former notes how
'typical markers of collective identities, such as "territory",
"culture", "history" or "religion" appear as autonomous
entities ... \[and\] as with commodities, the material thing-like,
tangible form of geographical entities becomes [[**a privileged medium**
to represent the less tangible historical relations among
peoples']{.underline}]{.mark} (Coronil 1996: 77). As a consequence,
**[[the Orientalist typifying or summational
attitude,]{.underline}]{.mark}** strongly criticized by Said for the
generalizations and essentialization of the non-western territories and
cultures it provided[[**, is the expression of a territorial entity
itself,** a territorial entity]{.mark} **[which in turn has been unified
and generalized by Said in a common type: European
culture.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Said was certainly correct to identify in the European social sciences
dealing with non-western societies and in particular Weber\'s ideal
types the danger of essentialist simplification that, at its core, was
informed by a Eurocentric attitude. Nonetheless, **[[when he accused
Eurocentrism of essentializing non-western
societies,]{.underline}]{.mark}** of neutralizing their internal
differences and their history, of addressing artificial entities such as
the 'Orient' or 'Islam' and the like, [[he himself ran the risk of **an
essentialist simplication**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is to say that he
committed the error of adopting a similar conceptual structure in
relation to Europe or the West, conceived as geographical, geopolitical,
geocultural abstract categories.

Beyond Orientalism

As Said clearly recognized, the most important task of all would be that
of undertaking 'studies in contemporary alternatives to Orientalism, to
ask how one can study other cultures and peoples from a libertarian, or
a non-repressive and non-manipulative, perspective' (Said 2003: 24).
This is certainly a difficult task, for which answers on the level of
meta-reflection -- epistemological and/or methodological -- seem to be
inadequate and misleading.21 **[[Said]{.underline}]{.mark}** was well
aware of the importance of such a task; indeed, his critique of the
manipulative and repressive depictions produced by European scholars
during centuries of uneven relations between the West and the East was
designed precisely in order to open the space for such non-repressive
perspectives. Nonetheless, while conducting this critique, he
**[[employed a methodological and theoretical
apparatus]{.underline}]{.mark}** much [closer to that which he
criticized than he thought.]{.underline}

The concept of [[discursive formation]{.underline}]{.mark}, used by Said
in order **[[to describe Orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** both [[as
the discourse produced by colonial rulers]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} as the [[discourse that performatively
produced them]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[recalls]{.underline}]{.mark}
Weber\'s analysis of **[[the active dimension of the relationship
between religion and political power]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This
pattern of thought seems to affect also their reciprocal anti-Marx (and
anti-Marxist) critique, as well as a certain epistemic ambiguity
according to which representation is never, and can never be,
'objective' or 'true'. At the same time, both affirm that the task of
the intellectual is to speak 'truth' to power and politics. In this way,
[**[the realm of politics becomes the locus]{.mark}** in which
determining decisions that 'truly' act upon reality can be
made.]{.underline}

Yet, in the last instance, the decisive affinity between Weber and Said
lies in the way in which both conceptualized their object of enquiry:
**[[Said]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not less than Weber, **[[produced an
'ideal type' of the West as the geographical, geocultural and
geopolitical agent of Orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, while
the formulation of a 'civilizational' and 'geocultural' ideal type was
precisely Weber\'s goal, in his search for the origin of Europe\'s
accomplishments in comparison to the East, Said\'s goal was that of
demolishing this 'civilizational' attitude that, according to him,
helped to immortalize the Orient as the static, geocultural entity thus
depicted by European writers. The conceptual coordinates that he
employed for **[[his analysis]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, arguably
**[[run the risk of unwittingly reinforcing]{.mark}]{.underline}** such
**[['civilizational' attitudes]{.underline}]{.mark}**.22

**[[This internal paradox strongly weakens Said\'s
critique]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not only in intellectual terms, as a
source of contradictions or incoherence, but especially **[[on the level
of what his critique aimed to be]{.underline}]{.mark}**: that is, [an
instrument for the pursuit of studies not affected by a manipulative and
repressive perspective]{.underline}. If the origin of this manipulative
perspective is thought to lie in a sort of geographical entity, or
immutable 'cultural' essence (regardless of whether it is the European
or the Oriental), it obviously becomes much more difficult, if not
[[impossible, to produce a **counter-non-manipulative perspective from
within**]{.underline}]{.mark}.23 Said\'s critique has been important for
the humanities and social theory as a stimulus for rethinking some
foundational categories and in terms of disciplining a certain
politico-theoretical 'arrogance'. The time has perhaps come, however, to
**[[rethink the terms of this critique itself,]{.underline}]{.mark}** if
we are to find a way to move beyond the 'ideal type' -- and reality --
**[[that lies at the heart of Orientalism.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**A relational approach to digital sovereignty centering the national

**[What is to be gained from a relational approach to digital
sovereignty?]{.underline}** This article argued that [[centering]{.mark}
the relationship between the [national Self and its Others]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} the [analysis of national digital sovereignty **elucidates
why and how** it emerges and develops. This]{.mark}]{.underline}
argument [[bridges two]{.mark} established [claims]{.mark} from
constructivist theories of culture and tech]{.underline}nology. [[One is
that national identity as]{.mark} articulated and [propagated by
governing elites guides the state's tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nological
program. [[Another is that identity is]{.mark} an [inherently
relational]{.mark} category]{.underline} that is [[maintained through
continuous boundary making between the Self and its Others.]{.mark}
Taken together, [these]{.mark} claims [indicate]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [[it is **analytically productive** and]{.underline}]{.mark}
sometimes [[**imperative to attend to relational dynamics between the
national Self and its Others to grasp the logics of digital
sovereignty**.]{.underline}]{.mark} To illustrate this proposition, this
article traced how Estonia's cultural constructions of its Russian and
Western Others shaped the contours of its digital sovereignty. It showed
that Estonia's digital initiatives, which are often couched in
technofuturistic postnational discourse, are meant to reaffirm Estonia's
sovereign territorialized existence within the Euro-Atlantic community.

Whereas this article examined digital sovereignty as an elite political
project manifested in highlevel official discourses and institutions,
[[the relational lens's theoretical and methodological versatility
**opens the door** for diverse]{.underline}]{.mark} scholarly
[[approaches]{.mark} to digital sovereignty. [Ethnographies of
infrastructure]{.mark}, for example, [can investigate Self-Other
dynamics in]{.mark} the [everyday]{.mark} workings of [digital
sovereignty, what]{.mark} cultural anthropologist of technology [Alix
Johnson]{.mark}]{.underline} (2021) [[conceptualizes]{.mark}
as]{.underline} the ["[mechanics of]{.mark} [sovereignty]{.mark}."
This]{.underline} approach [[treats sovereignty as a process of material
construction and explores its constitutive people and
practices]{.mark}.]{.underline} Lorraine Kaljund (2018), for instance,
draws on participant observation and interviews with the developers of a
recent e-Estonia initiative, data embassy, to explore how this team
embeds ethnocentric Estonian statehood into the project's software,
code, and policy.

[[Another dimension]{.underline}]{.mark} to consider [[is domestic power
struggles over competing constructions of Otherness and
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology. [[Analyses of debates]{.mark} and
decision making [surrounding digital]{.mark} [sovereignty]{.mark},
particularly]{.underline} the [**[use of Othering to legitimize one's
technological agenda]{.mark}**, [illuminate]{.mark} [how and why some
ideas but not others become state rhetoric and
policy]{.mark}.]{.underline} The official e-Estonia narrative
retroactively frames Estonia's digital turn as a self-evident response
to Soviet occupation and a reflection of ethnic Estonians' natural
predisposition toward technology. Yet, when Estonia's ruling coalition
first promoted the project of digital transformation in the early 1990s,
as part of their Western-oriented ethnocentric platform, it was not
uniformly supported across the political spectrum. How did e-Estonia
become political dogma, the questioning of which is seen as tantamount
to undermining Estonia's Euro-Atlantic credentials and benefiting
Russia? [[Detailing national technopolitical struggles]{.mark} would
[help]{.mark} [show digital sovereignty as always a product of political
contention]{.mark}, including over membership in the national imagined
community.]{.underline}

[Further, [sociological approaches]{.mark} might [explore how Self-Other
dynamics manifest]{.mark} within the circles [directly]{.mark} involved
[in]{.mark} the [making]{.mark} of [digital sovereignty. Historically,
dominant ethnic and political elites excluded their Others from creating
and enjoying tech]{.mark}nological [innovation on par with the
privileged group]{.mark}]{.underline} (Edgerton, 2006, pp. 131--136).
Scholars of e-Estonia note that the country's digital
elite---entrepreneurs, developers, policy makers---remain almost
exclusively ethnically Estonian (Kattel & Mergel, 2019, p. 147) and that
national digitization does not benefit the social and professional
standing of ethnic Estonians and Russians equally (Drechsler, 2018, p.
13). In Estonia and elsewhere, [future research could employ the
relational lens in examining the [**structural barriers to participation
in the making of digital sovereignty** and]{.mark} the [**consequences**
of]{.mark} such [representational imbalances.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Specific manifestations of Self-Other dynamics on digital sovereignty
will vary across national contexts. [The analytical task of the
relational approach is to discover and conceptualize Others and then
empirically demonstrate their material significance for digital
sovereignty]{.mark}. Beyond the nation-state, the relational approach
potentially applies to other types of digital sovereignty conceptualized
by scholars, such as municipal, personal, indigenous, corporate, and
others.]{.underline}

**[Essentialism DA]{.underline}**

**Essentialism DA: Said's analysis of hegemonic discourses creates a
binary of East and West which serves to uphold the very westernism he
criticizes -- takes out any links to hegemony too**

**Potter 19**(Naomi Potter, Orientalism: in review, Jan 15, 2019,

[[Said's essentialising of the Western scholars does not constitute the
start and end of his problems in Orientalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Turning to Said's [[(mis)use]{.underline}]{.mark} of Antonio Gramsci's
[[concept of hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark} can help us to
[[illustrate]{.underline}]{.mark} instances of [[essentialism]{.mark} in
categories of East and West in Orientalism]{.underline} which goes
beyond Western scholars. [[Said draws on]{.mark} the role of [hegemony,
the presence]{.mark} and construction [of 'certain cultural]{.mark}
[forms which dominate over others']{.mark}]{.underline} (2003: 6-7) [in
order [to demonstrate]{.mark} how [Orientalism]{.mark} managed to take a
sustained position as the [hegemonic discourse]{.mark}, being
[internalised by Western and Eastern cultures
alike]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, [[Said does not explore]{.mark} the
concept [fully]{.mark}, in particular he [fails to offer]{.mark} the
necessary [depth in Gramsci's concept of hegemony]{.mark} as distinct
from those such as Hegel and Marx.]{.underline} For Gramsci,
[[hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}, unlike mere domination,
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} not something held over another group but
rather [[the result of complex interplay]{.mark} of societal forces and
groups]{.underline} (Stein and Swedenburg, 2004: 9-10). Hence, Gramsci
had a [[unique focus on]{.mark} the active nature of
[counter-hegemony]{.mark} in history: its role in the 'war of positions'
which helps to [determine]{.mark} the [character of]{.mark} the
[hegemonic forces]{.mark}]{.underline} (Chalcraft and Noorani, 2007). A
[complete Gramscian analysis of hegemony would therefore offer great
depth in studying counter-hegemonic forces as active, autonomous agents
in terms of their role, position and culture]{.underline} (ibid.). There
seems to be a [distinct lack of reference to such agency of subaltern
groups in [Said's work]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ahmad, 1992: 108). Given
the time in which Said was writing and the proliferation of such forces
this [does [not]{.mark} seem [acceptable]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
instance, James McDougal illustrates the influence that religio-cultural
resistance of Islamic Algerians had on French colonial policy and the
distinctive practice by which the French ruled; such as citizenship
policies regarding the settlers vis-à-vis the colonized (Chalcraft and
Noorani, 2007, 49-66). These Islamic liberation forces such as the
Association of Algerian Muslims had been active for decades before
Orientalism was published (ibid: 56). [Said [misses]{.mark} the
[importance of the agency of counter-hegemonic forces]{.mark} in terms
of the nature and force of hegemony itself. This has the unfortunate
impact in his work of reflecting a specific idea of the eastern world as
passive and incapacitated, paradoxically leading to the assumption he
wants to criticise: that of an eternally distinct and less powerful
Eastern region.]{.underline} The essentialist implications of Said's
misuse of Gramsci's concept of hegemony do not end here, however.
[[Hegemony does not concern just polarized forces but also the way in
which it persists in culture within society at
large]{.mark}.]{.underline} Said often [refers in his work to the role
of literature and culture, however, in this exploration he neglects to
consider the many different forms in which culture is constructed,
beyond the dominating group itself.]{.underline} Melman, in observing
the role of women in constructing parts of the Oriental narrative,
highlights how ['[Europe's attitude towards the Orient was neither
unified nor monolithic']{.mark}]{.underline} (1992: 7). [In particular,
she [turns to the role of women from]{.mark} [the West]{.mark} in
depicting Eastern regions. The [perspectives]{.mark} of these women
often [included]{.mark} more [richer self-criticism]{.mark} towards
cultural superiority.]{.underline} Gramsci's account of hegemony
necessarily involves an extension of analysis to include this
intersectional group who are a subset of the bloc of Europeans who
explored, observed and studies the Middle East in the colonial period.
[In ignoring the role of women in the construction of Western hegemony
Said makes uncritical assumptions about the core features of Western
culture, locating them in the writings of academics throughout history
and thus essentialising the notion of the 'West' as a perpetually
dominating and uniform region of the world.]{.underline} Conclusion
[[Said]{.mark}'s failure to fully utilise the theoretical richness of
the theories and concepts which lay the foundations for his account led
him to [essentialise]{.mark} the categories of [East and West]{.mark} in
Orientalism.]{.underline} Firstly, in using historical methodology, Said
obscures his attempts at a Foucauldian discourse analysis generating a
historical account which does not do enough to interrogate the
mechanisms by which Orientalism comes about, seemingly presupposing
their existence in Western scholarly writing. Furthermore, this is only
made worse by his neglect of important aspects of the building of
hegemonic discourses which leads him to simplify both Western and
Eastern cultural production, making uncritical assumptions about their
core features of these categories and the extent of variation within
them. Both these errors lead to a paradoxical account from Said as his
intentions were not only to avoid such essentialist narratives but also
to critique them. [Despite these intentions however his treatment of
East and West does suffer due to his theoretical shortcomings leading to
essentialist construction of the categories.]{.underline}

**Orientalism causes the problems it attempts to prevent by exacerbating
divisions between the east and west**

Back to the Social Sciences [[When it comes to the immediate reception
of Edward's work, it was not only many Orientalists, or
near-Orientalists, who were **upset** but also many well versed in what
they regarded as a **progressive** **science** of
society.]{.underline}]{.mark} This certainly applied to persons such as
Harry Magdoff, the New York editor of the Monthly Review, who asked me
to review Orientalism, a book about which he had very mixed feelings. It
was also true of colleagues such as Fred Halliday, who argued that
[**[Orientalism]{.mark}** could easily be read as **[creating]{.mark}**
an irreconcilable [**division** between East and West]{.mark}, thereby
**[undermining]{.mark}** one of the basic features of our
[universalistic approach.]{.mark}]{.underline} No less telling was
Fred's second argument that, for many peoples of the Middle East in the
1970s, works by [the scholars Edward defined as
**[Orientalists]{.mark}** were [sometimes the **only** source of
**data** for understanding large parts of their own]{.mark} national
**[history]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Al-Azm was to make the same point
only a few years later. Several enormously important implications
follow. The first is that [[we need]{.mark} the social sciences in
Middle East studies not just for their own sake, but also to be able [to
**continue** to]{.mark} make [use]{.mark} of [works by persons we regard
as **Orientalists**]{.mark}, though [without falling prey to]{.mark}
their [**assumptions** and reductionism]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is
the more significant as [[our]{.mark} own [thinking contains]{.mark}
either unexamined [assumptions from the Orientalist period]{.mark} or,
at the very least, questions which we cannot help students to answer
properly because we do not know how to frame them or where to look for
answers.]{.underline} A good example of this is what used to be called
Islamic legal studies, studied only through certain canonic texts, and
posited on the notion that the master story was one in which modern
legal codes imported tout court from the West quickly supplanted
so-called traditional Shari'a law, confining it simply to the area of
personal status.

**[AT: Digital Orientalism]{.underline}**

Digital orientalism is not the driver behind hardline US foreign policy
against China -- American trust in the technological leadership of other
Asian countries such as South Korea prove that it isn't orientalism but
rather the existential security threat from Chinese hacking and
intellectual theft that necessitates US action.

Said's orientalism construct \[26\] is an important contribution to the
study of colonialism, post-colonial thought, international relations and
sociology. There is no reason to challenge it here. It's application to
the digital realm is an interesting and important one. The premise of
the editors of this special issue is that the West expected China to
evolve into a liberal democracy, but that this has not happened, and
moreover this (from the West's perspective "fundamentally illegitimate")
power has been able to increasingly compete head to head with the US and
the West in military, political, economic and technological terms, and
this has created deep fear among Western/democratic leaders. [[Fear
is]{.mark} a [key part of]{.mark} this [orientalist narrative]{.mark}.
The argument is that it is fear of this digital, political and cultural
other that drives a tough US, Australian, British (for example) policy
toward China, and drives a harsh stand toward Huawei.]{.underline} To
set this up in a cause and effect framework, then [[digital orientalism
is]{.mark} the independent [variable that causes fear in]{.mark} the
[US]{.mark} and others [towards China, that brings about]{.mark} the
dependent variable, [harsh policies toward China]{.mark} and Huawei
specifically]{.underline}. What this would mean is that other factors
would not explain the dependent variable, the harsh US/Western policy
toward Huawei. The question we will pose here is, is this correct?
[[There are **several**]{.mark} potential [**problems** with
this]{.mark} argument. First, [establishing]{.mark} that [fear is an
independent variable is not easy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Despite the
quality of their work generally speaking, the editors have not done the
thick description necessary to establish this. [[Simply showing tough
rhetoric]{.mark}, hawkish views [on the US]{.mark}/Western/democratic
[side]{.mark} (which are indeed there), [does not]{.mark} really **[do
the job effectively]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Second, [[we]{.mark}
[haven't considered **counterfactuals**]{.mark} or ruled out other
methods [that]{.mark} might test our hypothesis or [do a better job
explaining the outcome]{.mark} we observe (the harsh US/Western policy
toward Huawei) [than]{.mark} the proposed independent variable,
**[digital orientalism]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Following on from this
point, I would propose a consideration of the hypothesized independent
variable, "[[China]{.mark} and Huawei [pose **credible threats to
national security** of the US]{.mark} and other democracies" as a way to
understand the approach the US, Australia, the UK and others have taken
toward Huawei.]{.underline} Securitization provides a way of looking at
this issue that is helpful in this case. As Buzan, Waever and de Wilde
\[3: 25\] put it, Securitization is constituted by the intersubjective
establishment of an existential threat with a saliency sufficient to
have substantial political effects...The way to study securitization is
to study discourse and political constellations: When does an argument
with this particular rhetorical and semiotic structure achieve
sufficient effect to make an audience tolerate violations of rules that
would otherwise have to be obeyed? [There can be no doubt that [in the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, Australia, India and other countries,
[Huawei's 5G offerings have been securitized]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
this is evident by the "discourse and political constellations" in those
and other countries, as I've illustrated above. [Yet [why hasn't this
been the case in all countries]{.mark}?]{.underline} As Buzan et al.
note, referencing the work of Arnold Wolfers \[3: 30\], security threats
may be objective/real, or subjective/perceived, and where the twain meet
or diverge is not always easy to ascertain. [It is possible that A.
[China's Huawei is **acting as a threat** in some countries and not in
others]{.mark}.]{.underline} It's also possible that B. China's Huawei
and its 5G are a threat wherever they operate but some countries don't
yet understand that or don't believe it. It's also possible that C.
Huawei and its 5G are not a threat and have simply been socially
constructed as a threat, needlessly securitized. The notion that digital
orientalism is the reason for the securitization of Huawei and its 5G
would line up with the last tack, or C. The argument presented here,
however, is that [digital [orientalism does not explain]{.mark} the
[US]{.mark}/Western/democratic [response to China's growing **illiberal
impact**]{.mark} on global internet governance or its worrisome
presence, via Huawei, in more and more national 5G internet
infrastructure schemes]{.underline}. On the contrary, the hypothesis
posed here is something like B. above, [that real security concerns do,
that the [securitization]{.mark} of Huawei [is **not an irrational
response** to Huawei]{.mark} 5G [because of]{.mark} 1. some of
[Huawei's]{.mark} actions/**[track record]{.mark}**, 2. the nature of
its [relations with]{.mark} the [Chinese state]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} 3.
the track record or broader [actions]{.mark} (now and in the past) of
that Chinese state at home and abroad [as it]{.mark} [regards]{.mark}
media **[freedoms, intellectual property theft, human rights
problems]{.mark}**, and more.]{.underline} Having said this, digital (or
conventional) orientalism may be lurking in the background and
exacerbating technological and political dynamics. I suspect it is. The
editors are likely not incorrect in that sense, for certainly there is a
sense that China represents a "digital other," a "political other" and a
"cultural other" for Westerners and Liberals in general, and the notion
of digital orientalism may explain certain aspects of that. At the same
time, the argument presented here is that a careful study of [[China's
practices in the cyber-realm]{.mark}, whether at home or
abroad,Footnote9 [make it clear]{.mark} that [there are]{.mark} very
clear [**security-centric reasons** for]{.mark} concern about
[China's]{.mark} and Huawei's presence in 5G [internet infrastructure
construction]{.mark}, mobile phone handset production]{.underline}, and
even Chinese apps like TikTok and WeChat, which India has banned, and
both of which the Trump Administration tried but failed to ban in the
US. US, Australian, British, Swedish and other countries' increasingly
robust [pushback against Huawei and other Chinese players in the
construction of global 5G infrastructure can be easily understood by
studying A. China's cyber practices at home and abroad, and B. the
impact they have on the security (and perceptions of security) of
nations they work with. Very simply, those pushing back see what China
is doing, they don't like it, and they don't want Chinese companies to
have any major role in constructing telecommunications infrastructure
inside their countries.]{.underline} This is because they believe they
know what that will lead to, and they don't believe that is good from
their perspectives. If China/Huawei was a player like Nokia, Ericsson or
Samsung, the US and these others would not be raising alarms. [In fact,
the [US]{.mark}, Australia and UK [have not been raising alarms about
Nokia]{.mark}, Ericsson [or Samsung]{.mark}, the other major players in
5G. Why? Is it digital orientalism? In fact, [given]{.mark} that
[Samsung is Korean, one might expect]{.mark} the [US to **push back
against Samsung**, for it too is "**oriental**,"]{.mark}
non-Western]{.underline}, following the logic of Said. [[We
don't]{.mark} really [see that]{.mark}, however. **[South Korea is a
democratic polity]{.mark}** and a US ally, [so there is no]{.mark} angst
on Washington's part, no [concerns about security]{.mark}. Moreover, the
[South Korea]{.mark}n government [does not have]{.mark} a [history of
stealing US IPR, of spying on the US as China has]{.mark} been, or doing
anything that could be considered a national security threat toward the
US, so there has been **no pushback from Washington in the face of
Samsung's** growing presence in the US or in US 5G operations. [Some
argue]{.mark} that the [US]{.mark} simply **[refuses to yield]{.mark}
the [number one spot]{.mark}** to anyone, whether in technology or in
economic dominance. [Yet if]{.mark} the [US was pushing back]{.mark}
against Huawei [because]{.mark} the US wanted to be number one, because
the [US wanted to dominate, why wouldn't]{.mark} the US fund AT&T,
Apple, Google or someone else in the US to be number one? Why wouldn't
the [US]{.mark} [hinder]{.mark} the advances of Nokia, Ericsson and/or
[Samsung]{.mark} in the US and elsewhere? We don't really see any of
that, however. Digital [orientalism **doesn't**]{.mark} **really
[explain this]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in this case. I will argue here
that it's because first, [American thinkers do not think in such
hierarchical terms as their Chinese counterparts do (they aren't unified
in an obsession with being number 1 as is the case with the Chinese
state and its companies; see]{.underline} \[18\]. Second, [the US is not
pushing back against Huawei primarily because of market
imperatives/motivations, but rather because of concerns about security
and lack of trust in the Chinese state and Chinese companies that are
subject thereto]{.underline}. The [**[US trusts]{.mark}** the leadership
of **[Nokia, Ericsson and Samsung]{.mark}**, and [they don't see
their]{.mark} home [governments]{.mark} (Finland, Sweden and South
Korea]{.underline}, respectively) as [bent on [spying, stealing IPR and
undermining free expression]{.mark}]{.underline} at home and
increasingly around the world. [[It's about]{.mark} the [Chin]{.mark}ese
st[a]{.mark}te's **[very bad]{.mark} track [record]{.mark}** [of
**stealing intellectual property**, of **suppressing free expression**,
of]{.mark} cyber-surveillance and [**hacking**, of **suppressing
truth**]{.mark} and suppressing dissidents -- increasingly not only
inside China but abroad as well]{.underline}.Footnote10 [[Pushing back
against]{.mark} Huawei and [China's cyber-sovereignty]{.mark} model [has
become an **existential fight**]{.mark} for those who see things in the
way I have depicted here.]{.underline} In a telling statement by former

[Indications exist that the Xi leadership may be less satisfied with the
status quo than Chan claims given that current PRC actions push up
against not only the United States and Taiwan.]{.underline} South Korea
reported economic punishment from China as a result of the deployment of
a missile defense system to guard against possible North Korean attacks
and repeated dangerous behavior by Chinese fishing vessels.\[8\] Japan
expressed concern over increased naval and aerial activity by PRC assets
in and over contested areas.\[9\] Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam
indicate growing PRC harassment of their fishing and other civilian
vessels in the South China Sea, which is notable given that Indonesia
and the PRC do not have overlapping territorial claims.\[10\] [Then
there are [tensions along]{.mark} the [Sino-Indian border that]{.mark}
recently [resulted in deadly clashes]{.mark} between Indian and Chinese
troops.\[]{.underline}11\] [Current [PRC behavior is
worrisome]{.mark}]{.underline} for regional actors in other ways as
well. [[Australia reports economic pressure for not conforming to
Beijing]{.mark}'s preferences on pushing for an open investigation into
the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and complaining about [PRC]{.mark}
efforts to [influence]{.mark} its [internal
politics]{.mark}.]{.underline}\[12\] [Along with Canada, Australia saw
[citizens detained]{.mark} and charged for illegal activities under
suspicious circumstances.\[]{.underline}13\] [[Singapore]{.mark} too
[faced Chinese]{.mark} state [pressure]{.mark} over its insistence on
adherence the rule of law over the arbitration over the South China Sea
brought by the Philippines against the PRC.]{.underline}\[14\] That such
issues do not receive more treatment by Chan is curious since they raise
questions about PRC's commitment to self-restraint and can potentially
trigger the chain-ganging effects on U.S.-China ties that Chan warns
readers about (21-22, 211-215). Such friction can potentially harden
positions and raise the stakes over an issue such that prevailing
becomes more tied to status and other concerns, driving more aggressive
and even revisionist behavior.\[15\] [Chan's finding that [misplaced
worries about]{.mark} the [PRC]{.mark} [and]{.mark} its
[intentions]{.mark} stem in part from [misunderstandings of]{.mark}
perspectives on [international politics]{.mark} that are [informed by
theories from "the West"]{.mark} rather than China deserves elaboration
and debate. So-called "Western" international relations theories often
have parallels in the Chinese tradition, broadly construed.]{.underline}
Work analyzing Spring and Autumn, Warring States, Song, and Ming
documents indicate that the strategic thought that is prominent in these
periods closely resembles statecraft familiar to those in the
contemporary "West."\[16\] [Texts as varied as the Han-era annals
Records of the Grand Historian and the Ming-era fiction Romance of the
Three Kingdoms will suggest the same.]{.underline}\[17\] [[Parallels
between "Western" and "Chinese" approaches to politics are
unsurprising.]{.mark} Several millennia of collective human experience,
thought, and debate over statecraft, conflict, as well as governance are
almost certainly bound to produce similarities in responses. [Dividing
the world into "Western" and "Chinese"]{.mark} views of the world
[ignores]{.mark} the fact the [PRC]{.mark} has [disagreements
with]{.mark} ostensibly ["non-Western"]{.mark} polities such as India,
Indonesia, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, each with their own distinct
philosophical traditions.\[]{.underline}18\] Also, despite sharing
cultural origins, people in the [PRC and]{.underline} on [Taiwan
disagree fundamentally issues of political values and rights, not the
relatively simple issues of who should rule China or what a Chinese
state should entail geographically.]{.underline}\[19\] Moreover, the
PRC's ruling Chinese Communist Party draws at least some of its
inspiration from European thinkers in the form of Karl Marx and Vladimir
Lenin. Successive dynasties from historical China also proved themselves
very adept at conquest---that is how regimes and empires get
built.\[20\] Attributing tensions between the United States and PRC to
culture suggests an overly monolithic view of the rich and varied
philosophical and political traditions both major powers draw from,
giving them less credit than is due.\[21\] [[To claim]{.mark} that
contemporary international scholarship and [U.S. policy]{.mark} are
[unable to adequately understand China]{.mark} because they are
"Western" may [oversimplify]{.mark} the [nature]{.mark} and seriousness
of problems dogging [U.S.-China relations and their consequences for the
world.]{.mark} Relegating difference to culture is not only
[Orientalizing]{.mark}, it can [encourage]{.mark} a [misplaced
expectation]{.mark} that understanding can bring some sort of happy,
mutually acceptable outcome. Perhaps Beijing and Washington understand
each other well.]{.underline} They simply disagree fundamentally over
values and interests in ways that make finding mutually acceptable
accommodation increasingly difficult. This does not have to imply that
either side is morally superior or normatively "better" than the other,
just that understanding provides little promise for improving relations
and avoiding confrontation. Better accounting for such possibilities
invites fuller consideration of the roles that agency and contingency
play in major power relations, two features that Chan clearly identifies
as critical in the volume. [Thucydides's Trap? deserves much credit for
grappling with important, pressing, and difficult questions about the
drivers behind the downturn in U.S.-China relations and possible ways to
address this slide. Yet, Chan's outlook is more similar to Graham
Allison's than he initially lets on. Allison's call for creative
statecraft is possible only if the United States and China are not
locked in a structural situation which neither can escape or beset by
contingent circumstances that prevents Washington and Beijing from
effectively exercising the agency Chan believes is central.]{.underline}
Chan offers some insight when he points to divergences in perspectives
between Washington and Beijing but may be overly limiting the ways he
conceives of effects of culture and socialization. Likewise, the [volume
can go further in conceptualizing the various ways third parties such as
regional actors and international organizations can affect U.S.-China
ties, given that world politics is not just major powers going at each
other---a fact both Chan and Allison recognize. Major power interactions
simply do not occur in a vacuum. Such dynamics may reinforce competition
as much as ameliorate them, but their effects await further
clarification and explanation.]{.underline}

The key point here is not to debate the pros and cons of these changes
but to note that since Liberation (1949) and especially 1978,
[[China]{.mark} has [rapidly developed as an advanced technological
society]{.mark}. This development is vital for independence and security
but also a key source of global technological culture. This
[transformation]{.mark} is [not confirmed **solely**]{.mark} [by]{.mark}
China's [advances in tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies, for example,
e.g., quantum computing, artificial intelligence, green energy and space
exploration, or social media. [[Rather]{.mark}, **[in tandem with
China's advanced social and political organization]{.mark}**, we can
[note]{.mark}]{.underline} the widespread presence of [**the [modern
cogito--consciousness]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} all of which reflect
industrial ratiocination, industrial production, industrial
education]{.underline} and so on, and [all of which are consistent with
technological society]{.underline} \[41, 51\].

Western theorists have long debated the utopian and dystopian aspects
associated with becoming a technological society. [In the East, in many
instances, modernity emerged at speed when possible to counter Western
tech-supported imperialism]{.underline} \[81\]; [but [in the
West]{.mark}, the [development]{.mark} of technological society was
[always resisted by]{.mark} and in negotiations with [traditional values
and practices.]{.mark} [Even]{.mark} in [modern Western
philosophy]{.mark}, the critical tradition [has regarded technological
advances as being mostly negative.]{.mark}]{.underline} Ellul's critique
and [Heidegger]{.underline}'s nightmare have already been mentioned, but
these were inspired by Friedrich Nietzsche, and before him, Søren
Kierkegaard, who saw in 'modern man' an abomination of being \[3, 18,
79\]. In the post-war period, these concerns were expressed by the
Frankfurt School, but also in Michel Foucault's works, which equated
modernity with totalizing systems of control, with an unrestrained
biopolitics and governmentality manifesting in modern schools,
hospitals, prisons and so on, all of which were driven by the
psychological and physical discipline imposed by the modern market
economy \[55\]. Like [Nietzsche]{.underline}, [Foucault]{.underline}
romanticized certain aspects of Platonic and Stoic philosophy, while
[Kierkegaard and Ellul]{.underline} did something similar with
Christianity---with Ellul going so far as to describe mankind in modern
technological society as the "new demons," as "mature insects that have
nothing left to do but reproduce themselves and die" (\[13\] vii). In
short, [these theorists have had a profound influence on Western
society]{.underline}, and all the more so [because their
[critiques]{.mark} [reflected]{.mark} the [deep existential fears
associated with Western modernity]{.mark}: these have [included an
Orientalist pride in the West for creating modernity,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[unease]{.mark}** that [this creation
inescapably has always been]{.mark} a double-movement of [the **becoming
and unbecoming of the West itself.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

In [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, a different critical tradition
was [[established]{.underline}]{.mark} as [a [solution to]{.mark}
the]{.underline} even bigger [[**existential crisis** of **foreign
domination**]{.mark}. On the one hand]{.underline}, the
[prolif]{.underline}eration [of]{.underline} Marxism and especially
**[[Marxism-Leninism]{.underline}]{.mark}** substantially **[[normalized
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nological **[[development
as]{.underline}]{.mark}** a **[[historically
necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}** step [for human progress]{.underline},
one that [[viewed tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[and consciousness as
advancing and converging as and through the state
itself]{.mark}.]{.underline} On the other hand, [this was not deeply at
odds with Chinese tradition, particularly]{.underline} the
[Confucian]{.underline} tradition, one [in which]{.underline} technique
in the form of [ritual (li) was to be perfected by the individual,
whether the emperor, the gentleman, the father, as exemplars of the
ritual that constituted an advanced state of being]{.underline} (e.g.,
see \[50\]). [Thus, while some]{.underline} Chinese
[traditions]{.underline} certainly [resisted development, [China's rapid
advancement as a technological society finds **accordance with its
traditional and modern philosophical perspectives on human
progress**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[not just the existential
necessity of closing the tech]{.mark}nology [gap to establish and
sustain sovereignty]{.mark}.]{.underline}

It's [in this context]{.underline} that we can view [broad popular
support for Chinese development as a technological society in China
itself in terms of high rates of new technology adoption]{.underline}
\[39\], [popular support for scientific solutions]{.underline} to
problems, [and mass positive engagement in public policies that aim for
social advances consistent with]{.underline} both [individual and
national transformations]{.underline} that are [forward-reaching,
tech-based and]{.underline} tech-[oriented]{.underline}
\[70\]---[exemplified most recently by broad popular support for China's
"dynamic zero-covid policies"]{.underline} (dongtai qingling).

[While the West worries over the pervasiveness of
tech]{.underline}nology [and the relatively unrestrained power and
influence of big tech]{.underline}nology [firms, while it worries
over]{.underline} the [erosion of traditional values,
privacy,]{.underline} and so on, [while such resistances]{.underline}
have been most [recently]{.underline} on [display]{.underline} with
[broad pushbacks over attempts to formulate effective responses
to]{.underline} the [COVID-19]{.underline} pandemic, [**[we see the
opposite in China]{.mark}.** [Broad popular support has greeted,
effectively demanded and made possible dynamic zero-covid policies,
along with the rapid development and deployment of zero-covid
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies \[29\]. [This does not
mean]{.underline} that [Chinese people have liked the costs]{.underline}
associated with the policies \[78\], [but they have
preferred]{.underline} the [benefits over]{.underline} the [absence of
effective controls]{.underline} \[35\]. And [before this, surveys
indicate]{.underline} approximately **[80% of respondents]{.underline}**
have **[supported]{.underline}** the **[development and implementation
of China's "social credit system"]{.underline}** (shehui xinyong tixi),
[although the system is still incomplete]{.underline} and some doubt it
will achieve its stated objectives, or do so with reasonable risks to
personal privacy \[33\].

To be fair, [[not all innovations are popular]{.mark}.]{.underline} For
example, although it's still early days in the development and roll-out
of China's new digital yuan (shuzi renminbi), anecdotal reports suggest
less than enthusiastic receptions among the general public.
[Nevertheless, [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}-oriented [[innovations are
**popularly understood as essential for improved governance**, including
anti-corruption efforts, poverty alleviation, and market
management]{.mark}, and [they are reinforced with popular regulations
designed to limit the power of tech firms and harmful social
effects]{.mark} associated with tech]{.underline}nology, like unhealthy
screen times among school age children. Furthermore, [big tech advances,
like 5G, are celebrated, and names like Huawei are embraced as a matter
of national pride, with domestic sales soaring in response to
international rejections]{.underline} of the same. [The key
point]{.underline} here [is that [China's actualization as a
technological society that **advances with
tech**]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [[is **broadly
popular**]{.underline}]{.mark}, that it's [**[even valorized]{.mark}**
by Chinese theorists [as **consistent with**]{.mark} **the [rise of an
"intelligent civilization"]{.mark}**]{.underline} (zhineng wenming), one
[in which both governance and daily life are substantially supported by
big data, a]{.underline}rtificial [i]{.underline}ntelligence [and other
forms of digitalization]{.underline} \[20, 84\], and **[[consistent with
Marxist theories of social progress]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[76\].

[This isn't to say that there are no pushbacks, no traditional values
opposing, or again, that we don't see periodic attempts to regulate and
dismantle some technologies and tech firms.]{.underline} This has
happened quite publicly with new laws policies directed at digital
monopolies and anti-trust practices undercutting fair competition and
governance, as well as other developments considered harmful to social
and individual well-being. This was observed in enforcements against
Alibaba in 2021, with implications for other firms (in 2022, new
policies were announced to ease some big tech restrictions to help
bolster an economy battered by lockdowns, but this does not signal a
significant reversal of capacity or direction). Broadly, these
regulations coincided with new laws related to digital finance and
cryptocurrencies, but also video gaming, including limiting
inappropriate content and imposing strict limits on children's playing
times (2021). Those policies were paired that same year with strict
limits directed at buke---after-school study programs---which along with
video games were assessed as having reached a tipping point of negative
health effects and declining standardized test scores. In fact, these
were new attempts at earlier policies with similar goals, e.g., efforts
to limit teachers from assigning students unregulated, "off-the-books"
homework through social media (initiated in 2018, and reinforced in
2021).

[Overall, these policies were responses to pressures building over many
years in different sectors]{.underline}. It bears noting that [in the
case of policies affecting children]{.underline}, there had long been
efforts, often quixotic, to reign in China's intensely industrial model
of education \[15, 86\]; but [these were more fully addressed at the
height of China's response to the pandemic. There is no
evidence]{.underline} to suggest [these policies were advanced because
of the pandemic, i.e., when it was clear that online
schooling]{.underline} in lockdown locations [along with pandemic
related social restrictions had made children even more vulnerable to
digital exploitation and alienation]{.underline}, although such fears
were acknowledged by some (see, for example, Wang et al. \[77\], Teng et
al. \[73\], and Jiang, Tong, and Chen \[31\]). And [they stand in
**stark contrast with excessive gaming and increased digital-associated
alienation** affecting American children]{.underline} in the same period
[and others around the world]{.underline} \[17, 58\], and for which
[there were little to no public policy responses.]{.underline}

But from a holistic perspective, [these actions]{.underline} were not
contrary to China's emergence as a technological society but
[**consistent** with efforts to manage the well-being of that society as
a whole, one [in which governmentality is not understood as a conflict
between]{.mark} the [externality of a state and party vs.]{.mark} the
[internality of a more authentic or liberated individual existence, but
as]{.mark} the **[convergence of both as the same]{.mark}**, and
**[broadly consistent with shared thinking]{.mark}**]{.underline}, goals
[**[and objectives]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Ideally, this is what a
technological society would do, or else risk being less of a society and
less capable technologically. So [while we can point to
Heidegger]{.underline} and [Foucault and others as being
horrified]{.underline} by such developments or less dramatically, the
semi-luddite tendencies sometimes observed in European societies today,
in fact, [China's emergence as a technological society is not horrific
to most Chinese---**quite the opposite**. [This development connected,
however, to the **emergence in the West of a new Sinophobia and
Sino(techno)phobia.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

**Realism is the true root cause of Wests response to China, not

There are **[[several potential problems with this
argument]{.underline}]{.mark}**. First, [[establishing]{.mark} that
[fear]{.mark} [is an independent variable]{.mark} [is not
easy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Despite the quality of their work generally
speaking, the editors have not done the thick description necessary to
establish this. **[[Simply showing tough
rhetoric]{.underline}]{.mark}**, hawkish views on the
US/Western/democratic side (which are indeed there), [[does
**not**]{.mark}]{.underline} really **[[do the
job]{.underline}]{.mark}** effectively. Second, we haven't considered
counterfactuals or ruled out other methods that might test our
hypothesis or do a better job explaining the outcome we observe (the
harsh US/Western policy toward Huawei) than the proposed independent
variable, digital orientalism. Following on from this point, I would
**[[propose]{.underline}]{.mark}** a consideration of the hypothesized
independent variable, "**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Huawei
**[[pose credible threats to national security]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
the US and other democracies" as a way [to understand the
approach]{.underline} the US, Australia, the UK and others have taken
toward Huawei.

**[[Securitization provides a way of looking at this
issue]{.underline}]{.mark}** that is helpful in this case. As Buzan,
Waever and de Wilde \[3: 25\] put it,

[[Securitization]{.underline}]{.mark} is
[[constituted]{.underline}]{.mark} [[by]{.underline}]{.mark} the
intersubjective **[[establishment of an existential
threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** with a saliency sufficient to have
substantial political effects...The way to study securitization is to
study discourse and political constellations: When does an argument with
this particular rhetorical and semiotic structure achieve sufficient
effect to make an audience tolerate violations of rules that would
otherwise have to be obeyed?

There can be no doubt that in the United States, Australia, India and
other countries, Huawei's **[[5G offerings have been
securitized]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and this is **[[evident by the
"discourse and political]{.underline}]{.mark}** constellations" in those
and other countries, as I've illustrated above. Yet why hasn't this been
the case in all countries? As Buzan et al. note, referencing the work of
Arnold Wolfers \[3: 30\], security threats may be objective/real, or
subjective/perceived, and where the twain meet or diverge is not always
easy to ascertain. It is possible that A. China's Huawei is acting as a
threat in some countries and not in others. It's also possible that B.
China's Huawei and its 5G are a threat wherever they operate but some
countries don't yet understand that or don't believe it. It's also
possible that C. Huawei and its 5G are not a threat and have simply been
socially constructed as a threat, needlessly securitized. The notion
that digital orientalism is the reason for the securitization of Huawei
and its 5G would line up with the last tack, or C.

The argument presented here, however, is that **[[digital orientalism
does not explain the]{.mark}]{.underline}**
US/**[[Western]{.underline}]{.mark}**/democratic [[response to China's
growing illiberal impact on global internet
governance]{.mark}]{.underline} or its worrisome presence, via Huawei,
in more and more national 5G internet infrastructure schemes. On the
contrary, the hypothesis posed here is something like B. above, that
real security concerns do, that the
**[[securitization]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Huawei **[[is not an
irrational response]{.mark}]{.underline}** to Huawei 5G because of 1.
some of Huawei's actions/track record, 2. the nature of its relations
with the Chinese state, and 3. the track record or broader actions (now
and in the past) of that Chinese state at home and abroad as it regards
media freedoms, intellectual property theft, human rights problems, and
more. Having said this, digital (or conventional) orientalism may be
lurking in the background and exacerbating technological and political
dynamics. I suspect it is. The editors are likely not incorrect in that
sense, for certainly there is a sense that China represents a "digital
other," a "political other" and a "cultural other" for Westerners and
Liberals in general, and the notion of digital orientalism may explain
certain aspects of that. At the same time, the argument presented here
is that [a careful study of China's practices in the
cyber-realm]{.underline}, whether at home or abroad,Footnote9 **[[make
it clear that there are very clear security-centric reasons for
concern]{.mark}]{.underline}** about China's and Huawei's presence in 5G
internet infrastructure construction, mobile phone handset production,
and even Chinese apps like TikTok and WeChat, which India has banned,
and both of which the Trump Administration tried but failed to ban in
the US.

US, Australian, British, Swedish and other countries' increasingly
robust pushback against Huawei and other Chinese players in the
construction of global 5G infrastructure can be easily understood by
studying A. China's cyber practices at home and abroad, and B. the
impact they have on the security (and perceptions of security) of
nations they work with. Very simply, those pushing back see what China
is doing, they don't like it, and they don't want Chinese companies to
have any major role in constructing telecommunications infrastructure
inside their countries. This is because they believe they know what that
will lead to, and they don't believe that is good from their
perspectives. If China/Huawei was a player like Nokia, Ericsson or
Samsung, the US and these others would not be raising alarms. In fact,
the US, Australia and UK have not been raising alarms about Nokia,
Ericsson or Samsung, the other major players in 5G. Why? Is it digital
orientalism? In fact, **[[given that Samsung is
Korean,]{.underline}]{.mark}** [one might expect the US to push back
against Samsung, for [it too is "oriental]{.mark},"]{.underline}
non-Western, following the logic of Said. We don't really see that,
however. [[South Korea is a democratic polity and a US
ally]{.underline}]{.mark}, so there is no angst on Washington's part,
**[[no concerns about security]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Moreover, the
South Korean government does not have a history of stealing US IPR, of
spying on the US as China has been, or doing anything that could be
considered a national security threat toward the US, so there has been
no pushback from Washington in the face of Samsung's growing presence in
the US or in US 5G operations.

Some argue that the US simply refuses to yield the number one spot to
anyone, whether in technology or in economic dominance. Yet **[[if the
US was pushing back]{.mark}]{.underline}** against Huawei **[[because
the US wanted to be number one]{.underline}]{.mark}**, because the US
wanted to dominate, why wouldn't the US fund AT&T, Apple, Google or
someone else in the US to be number one? [[Why]{.mark} [wouldn't the US
hinder the advances of Nokia]{.mark}, [Ericsson]{.mark} and/or Samsung
[in the US and elsewhere]{.mark}?]{.underline} We don't really see any
of that, however.

**[[Digital orientalism doesn't really explain
this]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in this case. I will argue here that it's
because first, [[American thinkers do not think in such hierarchical
terms]{.underline}]{.mark} as their Chinese counterparts do (they aren't
unified in an obsession with being number 1 as is the case with the
Chinese state and its companies; see \[18\]. Second, the **[[US is not
pushing back against Huawei]{.underline}]{.mark}** primarily
[because]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [[market
imperatives/motivations]{.underline}]{.mark}, but rather because of
concerns about security and lack of trust in the Chinese state and
Chinese companies that are subject thereto. The US trusts the leadership
of Nokia, Ericsson and Samsung, and they don't see their home
governments (Finland, Sweden and South Korea, respectively) as bent on
spying, stealing IPR and undermining free expression at home and
increasingly around the world. It's about the Chinese state's very bad
track record of stealing intellectual property, of suppressing free
expression, of cyber-surveillance and hacking, of suppressing truth and
suppressing dissidents -- increasingly not only inside China but abroad
as well.Footnote10 [[Pushing back against]{.underline}]{.mark} Huawei
and **[[China's cyber-sovereignty model has become an existential
fight]{.underline}]{.mark}** for those who see things in the way I have
depicted here. In a telling statement by former Obama National Security
Advisor Susan Rice to Canada's CBC about the security threat Huawei
posed to Canada and others, Rice said,

It's hard for me to emphasize adequately without getting into classified
terrain how serious it is...It gives the Chinese the ability, if they
choose to use it, to access all kinds of information. Civilian
intelligence, military, that could be very, very compromising. So as
much as I disagree with the Trump administration on a number of things,
on this I believe they are right \[15\].

Given how much Rice was opposed to Donald Trump and almost all he stood
for, her agreement with him on this issue is striking. It seems clear
that this was no election-year posturing on the Trump Administration's
part, though that is how the Chinese government tends to frame
it.Footnote11 Huawei's building and operation of 5G networks in other
countries poses serious challenges to the security of potentially any
host-country, and what is being argued here is that this is the reason
for the increasing push-back, the securitization moves, China and Huawei
are facing as Huawei tries to expand its 5G operations abroad.

Toward the ends of explaining how and why Huawei 5G gets securitized in
some places and not others, I think it is possible to take Buzan, Waever
and de Wilde's securitization a bit further. I don't see regional
security complexes (a key factor in their work) at play in a prominent
way here, because the array of countries that have aligned in opposition
to Huawei are more diverse than any regional framework could
accommodate, with Sweden, Australia, India, the UK and the US all saying
no to Huawei, whereas Germany, South Korea, and Canada are keeping the
doors open. The US, for example, has close allies on both sides of this
digital divide, and there are members of China's region/neighborhood who
are on both sides of this divide as well, all of which is to say that
[[neither alliance patterns or regional patterns clearly explain the
digital divide over Huawei.]{.underline}]{.mark}

I think another concept found in Buzan, Waever and de Wilde's work \[3\]
better explains it, with the help of an expansion of another of their
concepts. The first concept referenced here is that of security
constellations (p. 201). Buzan et al. define them as "a much wider
concept than security complexes, reflecting as it does the totality of
possible security interrelationships at all levels" (p. 201). They add,
"security constellations will almost certainly generate a much fuller
set of nonregional subglobal patterns (such as those created by the sets
of countries that export copper or those countries vulnerable to
seal-level rises" (p. 201--2). Considering the range of Buzan et al.'s
"sectors" (ie, military, environmental, economic, societal and political
sectors), it is not clear where one would locate cyber, however. Given
that the work being referenced was published in 1998, it seems logical
that two new sectors should be added to Buzan et al.'s sectoral
framework, and this is the conceptual expansion referenced above: that
of cyber and space sectors. While space as sector is yet relatively
underdeveloped, cyber is a sector that has grown apace in recent years
and should now be considered a sector in its own right, as might be
evidenced by the addition of "Cyber Commands" and like agencies to the
arsenals of many nations today, whereas none existed only a few short
years ago. With the addition of a cyber sector and the interrelation of
this sector with extant sectors like military, economic and political
sectors, for example, [[it is clearer to see how a security
constellation encompassing all of these might
interplay]{.underline}]{.mark} so as to bring about the digital divide
we've seen over Huawei's participation in 5G network construction. For
example, whereas Sweden does not have to worry about a direct military
threat from China as it does from neighbor Russia, it does operate in a
security constellation wherein China's economic interests (and actions)
and the nature of its political sector/system are such that Sweden
perceives a threat. In the same way, whereas South Korea has a more
immediate potential threat from China militarily (after all, S. Korea's
mortal enemy North Korea is China's ally, and S. Korea's ally the US is
China's chief adversary), it does not apparently view China (or at least
Huawei) with as much trepidation as the US does. It may be that it
doesn't see its own interests as being as divergent from China's as the
US does. It may also be that its cool relationship with Japan for
reasons of unresolved history puts it in closer ideational orientation
to China (with which it shares some anti-Japanese historical angst)
than, again, would be the case with the US. Cyber is just one part of a
constellation of security interests between these many players and

Second, [[we need to **continue**]{.mark} the good work of
[**combining** training]{.mark} in languages, history, and culture with
training in the social sciences begun [in]{.mark} most American and
European centers of [Middle Eastern studies. One without the other is no
longer enough]{.mark} --- and is no longer seen to be
enough.]{.underline} Third, the social sciences provide a necessary
additive to works of analysis which operate simply at the level of
discourse and the various ways this has been used to answer questions
with little or no attention to what I would still want to call material
reality. Last, but not least, and in answer to those critics who accuse
Said-influenced social scientists of managing to avoid most of the
important political and ideological issues of the moment, [[we]{.mark}
now [have the tools]{.mark} to make important contributions to such
vital contemporary Middle Eastern subjects]{.underline} as military
occupations, religious politics, the explosive growth of the Gulf port
cities, and Islamic banking, not to mention [[the enormous **impact** of
**globalization**, where]{.mark} a [**knowledge** of]{.mark} the
[history]{.mark} of the region has to be [combined with an ability
to]{.mark} pick out and to **[describe]{.mark}** those [**underlying**
structures]{.mark}, dynamics, and trajectories [which **define**
them]{.mark} now and will continue to do so in the future.]{.underline}
All this is good news, and would certainly be good news to Edward Said
himself. Given that the field of modern Middle East Studies is only some
50 years old, that it had to extract itself from the hold of a first
generation of scholars who still saw the Middle East in very
reductionist, ahistorical terms, and that [[it takes time]{.mark} to
build up a core of experts versed in language, history, local knowledge,
and the social sciences, we finally have a set of praiseworthy
scholars.]{.underline} Conclusion [It is important to see Edward Said's
work, and the mixed reception it received, in the round. This means
[read]{.mark}ing [Orientalism]{.mark} as [carefully]{.mark} as its
author would wish [and]{.mark} then being able to [understand its role
as the **first** part of a project which **required** the construction
of **alternative methodologies** as its complement]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Inevitably, [[this **alternative**]{.mark}]{.underline} project [[proved
to be]{.mark} much more **[difficult]{.mark}** for reasons
[Edward]{.mark} himself could not anticipate and for which his own
[critique shares]{.mark} a small part of [the
blame]{.mark}.]{.underline} Nevertheless, viewed from the perspective of
modern Middle East studies, [[the **present** and the **future**
look]{.mark} surprisingly **[good]{.mark}**, with the ever [**expanding
production** of highly skilled]{.mark} graduate [students]{.mark} around
the world well-supplied with the tools not just to make use of whatever
data the field contains but also to use their knowledge of the various
social science disciplines [to **challenge**]{.mark} the [conventional
**wisdom** and]{.mark} the [old paradigms]{.mark} which continue to
stand in the way of a proper understanding of how Middle Eastern
societies, economies, and political systems really work.]{.underline}

**Said's goal of Orientalism was to critique an existing system, not
establish any sort of alternative.**

Given the temper of these times, [it was also natural that those early
[social science critics]{.mark} of Orientalist scholarship should band
together in workshops around joint projects designed to employ what we
identified as the German-style 19th century "critique" --- both to
[**expose** the **lack** of]{.mark} real [**explanatory value**
in]{.mark} traditional [**Orientalism** and]{.mark} to begin to
[provide]{.mark} what we took to be [a]{.mark} more [**useful** way of
studying the]{.mark} modern [Middle East.]{.mark} This
[included]{.mark}, among many other issues, [an attempt to come to terms
with]{.mark} the way in which not just the traditional academic
Orientalists but also several of the [founders of Western social
science]{.mark}, most notably Marx and Weber, held Orientalist-type
views concerning a fundamental difference between East and
West.]{.underline} Furthermore, also in anticipation of Edward Said, we
had begun to discuss the ways in which our own social science
disciplines, anthropology in particular, played a major role in what
Talal Asad called the "Colonial Encounter." Edward [Said]{.mark} himself
was [well aware]{.mark} of what we were attempting --- via our Review of
Middle East Studies --- having had his attention drawn to it by Fred
Halliday, a very important figure in my story. Nevertheless, for a
number of reasons, while Edward could commend us for working, as he put
it, in "disciplines not fields," [[I do not think he had any **real
understanding** of what practicing these disciplines actually
involved]{.mark}.]{.underline} This was partly the result of his
inclinations, character, and training. [[He was a **humanist**]{.mark}
through and through, [seeing the world]{.mark} via the optic of
literature, music, and [the arts, **not**]{.mark} by the use of
supposedly **[value-free]{.mark}** economics, political science, or
**[sociology]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Just as important, as he explained
to me, he had come to the end of his year at the Institute of Advanced
Studies in Palo Alto tired out by writing Chapters 1 and 2 and in such a
hurry to finish that he raced through Chapter 3, "Orientalism now,"
without either thinking through his argument as far as the relationship
between Orientalism and the modern centers of modern Middle Eastern
studies was concerned, or paying much attention to the alternatives
which he left, clearly and specifically, to others. [As he puts it in
[the book's **rushed**]{.mark}, last few pages: ... in conclusion, what
of some alternative to Orientalism? Is this book an argument only
against something, and not for something positive?]{.underline} And
then, having spent a sentence mentioning a number of what he called "new
departures," including the work of my own group --- called the Hull
group after the venue of our first few workshops --- [[he notes that
he]{.mark} does not attempt to do ... more than mention them or allude
to them quickly. My project has been to **[describe]{.mark}** a
particular system of [ideas, **not**]{.mark} by any means to
**[displace]{.mark}** the system of ideas, not by any means to displace
[the system **with** a **new** one.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Criticisms At the same time[, a number of empirical,
[epistemological]{.mark}, and normative [criticisms]{.mark} have been
raised against attempts to [develop]{.mark} a]{.underline} Chinese IR
theory and (by extension) '[[non-Western' IR.]{.mark} Empirically,
[Asian IR are not fundamentally different]{.mark} from those of Europe,
in the sense that anarchy, survival, and the balance of power have been
the key operating principles of state-to-state interactions since the
pre-modern period.]{.underline} For example, based on a detailed archive
analysis of China's foreign relations under the Song and Ming dynasties,
Yuan-kang Wang concludes that in the 'anarchical' international
environment at that time 'Confucian culture did not constrain ...
\[Chinese\] leaders' decisions to use force; in making such decisions,
leaders have been mainly motivated by their assessment of the balance of
power between China and its adversary' (Wang, 2011: 181). This finding
leads Wang to defend the theoretical utility of structural realism based
on the Westphalian system. [Epistemologically, too, critics point out
that it is ['unscientific' to emphasise]{.mark} and/or incorporate [a
particular]{.mark} culture or the [worldview]{.mark} of a particular
nation or region into IR theory, for a legitimately 'scientific' theory
should seek 'universality, generality']{.underline} (Choi, 2008; Song,
2001). [Mainstream]{.underline} (positivist[) IR theorists and
methodologists argue that [IR studies ought to seek observable general
patterns of states' external behaviour,]{.mark} develop empirically
verifiable 'covering law' explanations, and test their hypotheses
through cross-case comparisons]{.underline}. For example, Gary King,
Robert Keohane, and Sidney Verba make it clear that generality is the
single most important measure of progress in IR, stressing that 'the
question is less whether ... a theory is false or not ... than how much
of the world the theory can help us explain' (King et al., 1994: 101,
emphasis in original). From this perspective, any attempt to develop an
indigenous IR theory, be it non-Western or Western, is suspect because
it delimits the general applicability of theory. In the case of a
Chinese IR theory, criticism of this kind can increasingly be found in
studies by younger Chinese IR scholars. According to Xinning Song (2001:
68), Chinese scholars, especially younger ones who have studied in the
West, think that it is 'unscientific or unnecessary to emphasize the
so-called Chinese characteristics'. A similar criticism can be found
among Korean IR scholars in regard to attempts to build a 'Korean-style'
IR theory (Cho, 2015). Critics of the 'Korean School' of IR frequently
ask how can we make a distinctively Korean IR theory while trying to be
as generalisable as possible? In Jongkun Choi's (2008: 215) words, 'any
theorising based on Korea's unique historical experiences must be tested
under the principle of generality'. [[Normative criticisms]{.mark} of
attempts to build a 'non-Western' IR theory [highlight]{.mark} the
[relationship between power and knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}. Critics
point out that [although theory-building enterprises from the
perspective of the 'non-West' commonly begin by problematising
Western-dominated IR, the ongoing scholarly practices and [discourses
associated with 'non-Western' IR]{.mark} can also
[entail]{.mark}]{.underline} (or reproduce) [the [same]{.mark}
hierarchic and [exclusionary structure of knowledge production]{.mark},
which can fall prey to particular national or regional
interests.]{.underline} For example, in his discussion of Chinese
visions of world order, William Callahan doubts the applicability of
'Tianxia'. He claims that what the notion of Tianxia does is 'blur' the
conceptual and practical 'boundaries between empire and globalism,
nationalism, and cosmopolitanism'. Rather than help us move towards a
'post-hegemonic' world, Tianxia serves to be a philosophical foundation
upon which 'China's hierarchical governance is updated for the
twenty-first century' (Callahan, 2008: 749). Supporting this view,
Ching-Chang Chen (2011: 1) argues that: [re-envisioning IR in Asia is
not about discovering or producing as many "indigenous" national schools
of IR as possible. [Scholars]{.mark} ... [must]{.mark} also
[recognise]{.mark} and resist the [pitfalls]{.mark} [of equating the
mere increase of non-Western voices]{.mark} with the genuine
democratisation of the field, if they are to live up to their
responsibility to jointly construct a non-hegemonic
discipline.]{.underline} In a similar vein, Josuke Ikeda (2011: 12--13)
argues that '[[there needs to be a "post-Western" turn rather \[than a\]
"non-Western" \[one\]]{.underline}]{.mark} ... in order to address
another kind of "Westfailure" in IR theory'. In short, critics argue
that although it is our 'responsibility' to make IR more pluralistic and
democratic, 'most intellectual endeavors to construct non-Western IRT in
Asia run the risk of inviting nativism' (Chen, 2011: 16). Most recently,
Andrew Hurrell (2016: 149--150) has added that although developing
culturally specific ways of understanding the world 'undoubtedly
encourages greater pluralism', attempts to do so can also lead to a
national and regional 'inwardness' that works to reproduce the very
'ethnocentricities' that are being challenged.

**[Anti-eurocentrism fails]{.underline}**

**Anti-eurocentrism is flawed and unneeded -- western-centrism's role in
IR has decreased exponentially**

**Kuru 15**(Historicising Eurocentrism and antiEurocentrism in IR: A

'All scholars are Eurocentrics': The [[limits of
anti-Eurocentrism]{.underline}]{.mark} What can be seen as a [[major
problem]{.mark} with critics of Eurocentric IR is their tendency to
[overstate]{.mark} the [impact of Eurocentrism]{.mark} as an ideology by
confusing it with a more geo-historically situated form of Eurocentric
world order.]{.underline} Stated differently, [[anti-Eurocentrics do not
differentiate]{.mark} in general [between Eurocentrism as an
ideology]{.mark} (one that sees]{.underline} Europe, or a more [global
West as the only active subject of world politics) [and Eurocentrism as
a picture of the world that derives from]{.mark} the significance of
[Europe]{.mark}an powers]{.underline} at a certain point in time,
basically from the late nineteenth to the early twentieth centuries.
This [perception leads the critics to [exaggerate]{.mark} the [extent of
Eurocentrism in IR.]{.mark} Virtually all forms of analysis that give a
prominent role to the European (and Western)]{.underline} actors in the
global political order come to be seen as Eurocentric.
[[Whenever]{.mark} a scholar chooses to [focus on
the]{.mark}]{.underline} significance of the European powers (or the
[impact of the [West]{.mark}]{.underline}), \[they are\] [[targeted as
Eurocentric]{.underline}]{.mark}.3 The extent of this problem becomes
more visible when considering the work of [[anti-Eurocentric
scholarship,]{.mark}]{.underline} which [[demonstrates an unending
circle of intra-IR disciplinary blaming and
bashing]{.mark}.]{.underline} For instance, feminist IR scholarship
points to the prevalence of Eurocentric biases among their more
mainstream colleagues.4 In turn, they are accused by Hobson of
Eurocentrism. He sees in feminist IRʼs focus on women in the Third World
ʻthe risk of returning us back into the Eurocentric cul-de-sac of
rendering Eastern women as but passive victims of Western power, thereby
stripping them of agencyʼ. 5 Postcolonialists criticise in turn the
approach most closely associated with Hobsonʼs approach, that is,
historical sociology for carrying Eurocentric features.6 [Finally,
postcolonialists are attacked by advocates of decolonising approaches
who find the presence of Eurocentric positions in the work of the
former.]{.underline}7 This inherent [race to the bottom]{.underline} in
the form of accusing others as Eurocentrics [demonstrates that a
[mere]{.mark} [proliferation of anti-Eurocentric analyses will not
suffice to de-Eurocentricise IR. Otherwise]{.mark}, disciplinary
self-reflexivity will be [reduced to blaming others]{.mark} for
Eurocentrism [without]{.mark} turning to [a broader contextualisation
of]{.mark} and variation between [Eurocentrisms]{.mark}.]{.underline} It
should be evident that this would [help]{.underline} us
[[neither]{.mark} in [reduci]{.mark}ng the actual [impact of]{.mark}
ideologically motivated [Eurocentric]{.mark} [analyses]{.mark} in the
discipline [nor]{.mark} in [gain]{.mark}ing a [better understanding of
our own]{.mark} positions and [scholarly motives]{.mark}.]{.underline} A
major aspect in this context concerns the differences between the
continuing impact of European/Western influences in todayʼs world and
the way in which Western-dominated power-knowledge connections of the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are to a certain extent
overcome. [[Although many scholars criticise IRʼs Eurocentrism]{.mark}
for the close relations they find between knowledge]{.underline}
(production) [practices and the supposed power impact of the West, [they
overlook the extent]{.mark} [to which the]{.mark} gradual [decline in
the Westʼs power has also changed these interactions]{.mark}. This means
that one has to approach Eurocentrism in a more nuanced fashion so that
the residual impact of the Western powersʼ relatively decreasing global
significance can be recognised as the instantiation of a gradual process
of de-Eurocentricisation that goes in line with a less Western, more
post-Western world.]{.underline} Immanuel Wallerstein speaks of
ʻanti-Eurocentric Eurocentrismʼ. According to him, this form of
Eurocentric scholarship asserts either that Europe just interrupted
others from doing what they were doing and did it herself, or that
Europe did something which was just ʻa continuation of what others had
already been doing for a long time, with the Europeans temporarily
coming to the foregroundʼ. To overcome such anti-Eurocentric
Eurocentrism, [scholars must ʻcease trying to deprive Europe of its
specificity on the deluded premise that we are thereby depriving it of
an illegitimate creditʼ. Wallerstein suggests that ʻ\[[w\]e must fully
acknowledge]{.mark} the particularity of [Europeʼs
reconstruction]{.mark} of the world because [only then]{.mark} [will it
be possible to transcend]{.mark} it.' 8 Following this assumption, even
Hobsonʼs anti-Eurocentrism emerges as an instance of Eurocentrism, for
he tends to look for non-Western origins in virtually all historical
developments of the modern era, overlooking thus the [extent to
which]{.mark} the [Western dominance]{.mark} in the nineteenth century
[made]{.mark} its previous [interactions]{.mark} with the non-Western
actors [less relevant]{.mark} when thinking of Eurocentrism in that
era.]{.underline}9 I turn to a detailed examination of Hobsonʼs approach
after providing a more differentiated typology between various forms of
Eurocentrism. As another example in which Wallerstein would have seen
anti-Eurocentric Eurocentrism, one can refer to Kerem Nişancıoğluʼs
recent study on the peripheral role given to the Ottoman Empire in
studies of capitalist development. He argues that IR ʻhas been built on
largely Eurocentric assumptionsʼ with the Ottomans being ʻabsent,
passive, or merely a comparative foil against which the specificity and
superiority of Europe has been definedʼ. 10 [His counterpoint is that
the Ottoman Empire ʻwas arguably the most powerful actor in the Early
Modern periodʼ.]{.underline} Based on his employment of Trotskyʼs theory
of uneven and combined development, the combined impact of Ottoman
strength and Europeʼs privilege of backwardness would lead the latter
(especially its northwestern parts, that is, England) to gain ʻthe
geopolitical space required to conduct modern state-buildingʼ. Thus,
Nişancıoğlu presents a revision of the historical sociology of
international relations, which he accuses of being too concentrated on
European history. The point of contention is about conditions affecting
the birth of modern capitalism. However, it is possible to see this as
another issue, one that is researchable in a historical framework
without accusations of Eurocentrism. Nişancıoğlu himself is careful to
add that his goal is not ʻto argue that capitalismʼs origins were
entirely extra-Europeanʼ nor to ʻseek to substantially diminish the
centrality or uniqueness of Europe in this processʼ. 11 These are big
caveats that show that even self-declared non-Eurocentric accounts
recognise Europeʼs specific role in the emergence of the modern world
order. Hence, it becomes possible to reject Nişancıoğluʼs general
critique of IRʼs Eurocentrism, for his own work illustrates that the
broader assumptions of IR still hold with regard to Europeʼs dominant
role in the emergence of modern capitalism and the international order
associated with it.

tries to overcome**

The cover of Kishore Mahbubani's 2008 publication The New Asian
Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East presents
readers with what seems to be the global sign for financial growth:
skyscrapers under construction. Cranes perch atop every tower,
suggestive of the "all-at-once-ness" of growth in Asia. [The illuminated
construction site stretching into the night sky highlights the
unrelenting pace of growth, which proceeds even as the rest of the world
sleeps. The scene is a familiar one, prefigured by the race for the
tallest building that ran across parts of Asia]{.underline} (Singapore,
Malaysia, Taiwan) in the early 2000s. 1 [But the unpainted, all white
structures feel eerily hollow and decontextualized. There's no sign of
the human laborers who welded and wired these structures. The lot is all
but empty, with the exception of one nondescript car parked in the
foreground. This scene of speculative building--- construction predicted
but not contracted to sell---feels like an already haunted future, in
which "[New Asia" has become an empty lot, evacuated of its denizens and
prepared to signify the **sheer potential of
capital**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Published amid the financial crisis of
2008, Mahbubani's book, as well as his Financial Times declaration of a
realizable Asian Century that serves as this essay's epigraph, excite
what Alan Greenspan once called "irrational exuberance." Uttered in a
speech Greenspan gave in 1996, in his capacity as chairman of the U.S.
Federal Reserve, the phrase characterized the "unduly escalated asset
values" of Japan's economic bubble. The next day, Tokyo's stock market
fell sharply, closing 3 percent down, and Greenspan's speech largely
presaged the Asian financial crash a year later. The extent to which
economic projections hang on the words of figureheads like Alan
Greenspan demonstrates how such **[[speculations work as performative
speech acts that call the future into being]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Similarly, [the [optimism]{.mark} Mahbubani announces in
forward-looking, prophetic tones ("optimism will deliver the Asian
Century"), [affectively structures speculative investment in Asian
futures]{.mark}. This [vision of the new Asian hemisphere, colonized by
empty high-rises reaching toward limitless horizons and built by
deterritorialized workers, projects a future of automated speculative
building, fueled by investment hungry banks]{.mark}]{.underline}. If
Greenspan and Mahbubani both grasp how their respective declarations of
pessimism and optimism will affect the global economy, they do so with
two different Asias in mind: Japan of the late 1990sand Singapore at the
dawn of a "new Asia" in 2008. 2 The so-called Asian Century, toward
which [Mahbubani's optimism strains, [functions as a largescale
speculative fiction spawned from neoliberal fantasies that capitalize on
a literary genre's already problematic investments in
techno-Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. In their 1995examination of
techno-Orientalism, David Morley and Kevin Robins call attention to U.S.
and European fantasies of Japan and its shift in those imaginaries in
the 1980s from an exotic playground to a land of emotionless automatons.
Perhaps epitomized by Western dystopian cyberpunk such as Ridley Scott's
Blade Runner (1982) and William Gibson's Neuromancer (1984),
techno-Orientalism figures the Japanese as "unfeeling aliens; they are
cyborgs and replicants. But there is also the sense that these mutants
are now better adapted to survive in the future"(170). While Morley and
Robins understand techno-Orientalism as primarily born out of Western
anxieties about Japan's challenge to U.S. economic hegemony, they also
suggest more specifically how [[techno-Orientalism arises just as Japan
emerges as "the largest creditor and the largest net investor in the
world"]{.underline}]{.mark} (153). What Morley and Robins never fully
develop, and what I want to explore in more depth here, is this
coordinated turn toward Asian futures in both financial and cultural
forms of speculation. Mathematical models of probability and investment
strategies based on extrapolation are forms of speculative fiction that
project finance capitalism's visions of futurity onto the world.
Interdisciplinary scholarship from the past two decades has pointed to
the performative aspects of economic speculation (MacKenzie, Muniesa,
and Siu), the sociological systems of financial markets (Knorr-Cetina
and Bruegger), the impact on subjectivity of financial instruments such
as derivatives and debt bundling (LiPuma and Lee), and the
"financialization of daily life" (Martin). Because speculative economies
rely ever more on rhetorical tools and narrative strategies to explain
and market the practice of trading on futures and securities, financial
speculation and speculative fiction both participate in the cultural
production of futurity, and futurity becomes the arena in which new
subject formations emerge. [[Does techno Orientalism register anxieties
about finance capitalism, or does finance capitalism use
techno-Orientalism as a basis for its extrapolations of
futurity?]{.mark} I emphasize the co-constitutive relationship between
the cultural production and financial worlding of Asian
futurity.]{.underline} A peculiar question arises then, when Asian
economic and political architects themselves participate in the
projection of Asian futurity, all the while drawing on a
techno-Orientalist toolkit. I argue that [[critical analysis of the
discursive site of Asian futurity reveals points of contradiction in
American neoliberalism as it travels that have to do with earlier forms
of racial and colonial subjugation providing the scaffolding for the
architecture of neoliberalism itself]{.underline}]{.mark}.3 [As [Asia
develops its own neoliberal rhetoric, articulating its own futurity
poses certain problems that necessitate a disavowal of the racism of
techno-Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[What stands in to "smooth"
that difficulty is the heteronormativity techno-Orientalism always
espoused that Asian futurity posits anew as part of its road
map,]{.mark} [capitalizing on aspirational teleologies, valuations of
privatized worth, and nationalisms consolidated through processes of
racialization]{.mark}.]{.underline} I focus my investigation on
techno-Orientalism's role in the production ofa global neoliberal
subject in contemporary Singapore, where a tech economy adopts and
adapts localized versions of seemingly universalized notions of "the
good life." Building on Lauren Berlant's theorization of "cruel
optimism," this essay levies a critique of "the Asian Century" as
imagined by economists around the world. It argues that [[a revisionist
Asian futurity needs to intervene]{.mark} in the neoliberal orientations
of "the good life" and, in the face of foreclosed futures, open
possibilities of]{.underline} what Eve Sedgwick has called ["reparative
practices."]{.underline}

Sinofuturism merely flips a Western binary of either a China stuck in
the past or one stuck in the future -- that denies China the agency to
ever challenge the destruction of their coevalness and instead
perpetuates a techno-orientalist fantasy about an exotic futuristic
China.

[This genealogy of temporal othering evidences how both
**[sinofuturism]{.mark}** and technoorientalism [are]{.mark} not merely
[**culpable of propagating exoticizing fantasies** about]{.mark} the
future in [China]{.mark} or other Asian contexts, [but also responsible
for perpetuating]{.mark} a more generalized **[denial of
coevalness]{.mark}**. In contrast with established orientalist tropes
and with more recent liberal-democratic varieties of "sinological
orientalism" (Vukovich), [China is no longer deemed to be trapped
in]{.mark} its atemporal [pastness]{.mark} or condemned to eventually
synchronize with modernity: [instead, it already inhabits the
future]{.mark}, arrives from it,]{.underline} or beckons a Chinese mode
of futurity with global implications. In all these variants,
[[**sinofuturist imaginations** **deny China**]{.mark} **the
[possibility]{.mark}** [of challenging]{.mark} and negotiating
representation in the [coeval present staked out by West]{.mark}ern
knowledge production]{.underline}. [The [future is for sinofuturists
what]{.mark} the [past was for orientalists: a foil]{.mark} for steering
representation [by denying coevalness]{.mark}. The [legitimacy of
sinofuturism is premised on]{.mark} a parallelism with other [emerging
articulations of futurity]{.mark}: [the comparative approach]{.mark}
proposed by Armen Avanessian and Mahan Moalemi, for example, [juxtaposes
it with]{.mark} Afrofuturism, gulf futurism and [other
'ethnofuturisms']{.mark}, highlighting the novel emergence of
futureoriented imaginaries from non-Western contexts.]{.underline} While
this approach cautions that futuristic articulations "outside of the
west and across the Global South and other former peripheries can also
evolve into neo-colonial tendencies" (Avanessian et al. 9), [[it]{.mark}
also **[glosses over]{.mark}** a more fundamental [problem of
**serializing ethnic**]{.mark} or national [futurisms]{.mark}: their
reference to the future might be the only contact point between
otherwise radically different aesthetic and ethical
programs---[something]{.mark} that the history of [Italian futurism
**glaringly evidences**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even Lawrence Lek's
artwork Sinofuturism (1839-2046 AD), which has become a defining
reference for this term, repeatedly reaches for a common tactical
repertoire among "minority movements which share an optimism about
speed, velocity, and the future as a means to subvert the institutions
of the present" (Lek). As proven by Afrofuturism, movements that upend
hegemonic and colonial temporal frameworks are fundamental to reclaiming
representational agency against the denial of coevalness. [But in order
to do so, [they have to]{.mark} organically [emerge from]{.mark} the
[periphery of Western time, rather than]{.mark} be conjured as part of
**[technoorientalist fantasies]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [Instead,
[while]{.mark} the [post-digital exotic pastiches of sinofuturism have
circulated]{.mark} enough to consolidate into a recognizable aesthetic
appropriated and subverted by local electronic musicians and new media
artists, [it is]{.mark} their less self-aware and [more sensational
variety that continues]{.mark} to find currency in popular
[represent]{.mark}ations of [China]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
introductory chapter of William A. Callahan's China Dreams: 20 Visions
of the future, aptly titled "[China is the future," offers a striking
example of this banal brand of sinofuturism: It's an exciting time to be
Chinese. While in the West the first decade of the 21st century was
defined by pessimism due to 9/11, the Iraq War, and the Great Recession,
Chinese people are very optimistic that the 21st century will be the
"Chinese century."]{.underline} The fruits of China's three decades of
rapid economic growth are there for all to see: by 2010, the People's
Republic of China (PRC) had the fastest computer in the world and the
smartest students in the world, and it was enthusiastically entering the
space age---just as the United States was retiring its fleet of Space
Shuttles. (Callahan 1) [This book's first paragraph strings together
many of the tropes highlighted above: national identity, the idea of a
Chinese century, the PRC's economic growth, and the post-reform
developmental leapfrogging indexed by the trifecta of computational
primacy, academic talent and space exploration, all measured against
rusty yardsticks left over from the Cold War era.]{.underline} To sum
up: sinofuturism responds to a lack of engagement with China's future in
both academic expertise and popular discussions of the country. It does
so provocatively, by speculating on possible future configurations of
wildly different aspects of Chinese history, culture and society,
juxtaposing technological developments and traditional customs, global
trends and local phenomena, political systems and material forces. [At
the same time, [sinofuturism]{.mark} draws on--- and at times
**[directly reproduces]{.mark}**---the tropes and [narratives of
techno-orientalism]{.mark}, [reducing China to]{.mark} the last in
[a]{.mark} series of East [Asian countries investing]{.mark} resources
[to accelerate]{.mark} [industrialization]{.mark} and informatization
[and]{.mark} thus [threatening]{.mark} the [Western grip on
technological innovation]{.mark} and transnational supply chains. The
historical superimposition of techno-orientalism with popular culture
genres like cyberpunk offers a convenient route for
[sinofuturism]{.mark} to find success as an aesthetic repertoire that is
legible across contexts: outside China, it [reacts with]{.mark} the
mixture of [fascination and anxiety for]{.mark} the
[illegibility]{.mark} and scale [of China's rise]{.mark}; inside China,
[it lends itself to]{.mark} the [**self-orientalizing celebration** of
national success]{.mark}.]{.underline} But this should not obfuscate its
main operation. [[Sinofuturism, like techno-orientalism, operates as a
**denial of coevalness**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} In being largely
articulated from the outside as an interpretive discourse, it posits
some sort of equivalence between China and the future: [[China is the
future]{.mark}, China comes from the future, the future will come from
China, and so on.]{.underline} [[These proclaimations are]{.mark} as
enticing as they are **[sus]{.mark}**pect, for they deploy the future as
a way of deferring participation in contemporariness. The [future
functions exactly as]{.mark} the [past does in orientalist arguments:
as]{.mark} a [temporality through which otherness can be]{.mark} safely
[managed]{.mark} and problematic interactions steered away from. If the
locus of Said's orientalism was the Hejaz region, "a locale about which
one can make statements regarding the past in exactly the same form (and
with the same content) that one makes them regarding the present" (Said
235), the loci of sinofuturism are the skylines of Shanghai, Shenzhen,
and Chongqing, ready to be inscribed with claims about the future.
[Sinofuturism is]{.mark} a **[reverse orientalism]{.mark}**---[an
orientalism operating]{.mark} its [denial of coevalness through]{.mark}
the **[attribution of futurity]{.mark}**]{.underline}
