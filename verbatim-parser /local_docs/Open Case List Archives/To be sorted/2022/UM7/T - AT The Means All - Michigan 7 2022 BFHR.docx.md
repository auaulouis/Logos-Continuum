Question 11.a\'s grammar and usage to determine whether it was
fundamentally ambiguous. He [wrote]{.underline},

\[t\]he question did not ask, \"Are you the actual transferee/buyer
of a firearm(s) listed on this form\...?\" or \"Are you an actual
transferee/buyer of the firearm(s) listed on this form \...?\" \[Rather,
it asked: Are you the actual transferee/buyer of the firearm(s) listed
on this form . . . ?\]

The question obviously contemplated the purchase of multiple firearms in
that each time \"firearm\" is used in the question i\[t\] appears with
the parenthetical plural as \"firearm(s).\" (ECF No. 17-1 at 1.) [The
use of the definitive article \"the\"]{.underline} [made clear that the
question]{.underline} [posed an]{.underline} **[all-or nothing
proposition]{.underline}**; a \"Yes\" answer was appropriate only if the
person completing the form was purchasing all of the firearms for
herself. In a transaction involving multiple firearms, if the transferee
was not the actual purchaser of all of those
firearms,[ \[\*10\] ](https://advance-lexis-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=bd30ef98-eea9-4240-a465-a60483485c4d&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A6550-KS41-F2TK-21T4-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=6417&pdshepid=urn%3AcontentItem%3A654R-5533-GXF7-3207-00000-00&pdteaserkey=sr1&pditab=allpods&ecomp=rzznk&earg=sr1&prid=061113ce-b4f2-48ee-a749-639c50629bed) the
transfer could not proceed. It was unnecessary for the form to have
asked, \"Are you the actual transferee/buyer of all the firearm(s)
listed on this form\...?\" as Nash suggests it could have (ECF No. 17 at
7). [The addition of the word \"all\" may add emphasis but would not

that the Form must have used \"the\" to denote an all-or-nothing
proposition because the Form could have used \"a,\" but did not. But
this conclusion layers a definition onto the humble word \"the\" that it
simply does not have.

In this case, the Form uses \"the\" before the words \"firearm\" and
\"actual transferee/buyer\" to denote \"one or more of the people or
things already mentioned\"---i.e., the buyer who filled out the
identifying information and the firearms that are the subject of the
Form. The determiner
\"a\"[ \[\*11\] ](https://advance-lexis-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=bd30ef98-eea9-4240-a465-a60483485c4d&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A6550-KS41-F2TK-21T4-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=6417&pdshepid=urn%3AcontentItem%3A654R-5533-GXF7-3207-00000-00&pdteaserkey=sr1&pditab=allpods&ecomp=rzznk&earg=sr1&prid=061113ce-b4f2-48ee-a749-639c50629bed) is
used \"when referring to someone or something for the first time in a
text or conversation.\" \"A,\" New Oxford American Dictionary (3d ed.
2010). Using \"a\" in Question 11.a---when the identity of the
transferee/buyer has been established and the subject of the form is
commonly understood to be the firearms to be transferred---would be odd.
Thus, [use of the word \"the\"]{.underline} in lieu of \"a\" [does not
introduce]{.underline} **[an all-or-nothing proposition.]{.underline}**
[It merely indicates that **the**]{.underline} Question 11.a [referred
to]{.underline} previously identified or [commonly
understood]{.underline} people or [things]{.underline} (the buyer, the
firearm(s) subject to transfer).

Moreover, because [the word \"the\"]{.underline} [can be used to refer
to \"one or more\" people or things]{.underline}, its use in Question
11.a [does not make \"clear that the question posed an all-or-nothing
proposition]{.underline}.\" **[Far from it, in fact.]{.underline}**
Imagine[, for example]{.underline}, that [a host has a dinner party and
makes two dishes]{.underline}. [Guests add two more dishes to the table,
so now there are four dishes.]{.underline} [Another guest asks the host,
\"Did you make the food?\"]{.underline} The host would most likely say,
\"yes, some of it,\" but could also, in a moment of humility, say, \"no,
just these two items.\" **[\"The food\" does not clearly mean \"all the
food,\"]{.underline}** [it **just** refers
to]{.underline}[[ \[\*12\]]{.underline} ](https://advance-lexis-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=bd30ef98-eea9-4240-a465-a60483485c4d&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A6550-KS41-F2TK-21T4-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=6417&pdshepid=urn%3AcontentItem%3A654R-5533-GXF7-3207-00000-00&pdteaserkey=sr1&pditab=allpods&ecomp=rzznk&earg=sr1&prid=061113ce-b4f2-48ee-a749-639c50629bed) [**one
or more of the food items** assumed to be common
knowledge.]{.underline} Accordingly, without an explanatory clause, the
host could not 100% truthfully and accurately say either yes or
no---while she did make some of the food, she did not make all of it.
(Another way of looking at it: she could not 100% falsely say yes or no,
either). The questioner and answerer must take another step before
reaching a mutual understanding of what is being asked and
answered. [Manapat, 928 F.2d at
1100](https://advance-lexis-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=bd30ef98-eea9-4240-a465-a60483485c4d&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fcases%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A6550-KS41-F2TK-21T4-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=6417&pdshepid=urn%3AcontentItem%3A654R-5533-GXF7-3207-00000-00&pdteaserkey=sr1&pditab=allpods&ecomp=rzznk&earg=sr1&prid=061113ce-b4f2-48ee-a749-639c50629bed). [On

she the actual buyer or transferee of the firearms that are the subject
of the Form? Yes, for one of them; no, not for the second gun. Perhaps
she was being evasive, or perhaps she was confused, but she had a basis
in fact to provide either answer. As in the example above, to be fully
truthful, both potential answers require an explanatory clause. **[If

**Supreme Court of Minnesota 12**. "State v. Hohenwald"; A10-1986; July
11, 2012; Lexis //BY

With regard to Minn. R. Crim. P. 20.01, [the definite article
\"the\"]{.underline} is a word of limitation that indicates a reference
to a specific object. The definite article \"the\" [particularizes the
subject which it precedes. \"The\" is used before]{.underline} singular
or plural [nouns and noun phrases]{.underline} that denote
**[particular, specified]{.underline}** persons or [things]{.underline}
Applying the word \"the\" as a word of limitation, Rule 20.01 requires
the suspension of the proceedings in the then-existing case in which the
court orders the suspension, not in an unspecified or indefinite number
of cases. The word \"the\" is a word of limitation, [not a word of
indefinite or **generalizing** **force.**]{.underline} [If the drafters
of the criminal rules intended to suspend **all
proceedings**]{.underline} brought against a particular criminal
defendant, including those not yet in existence, [they could have easily
used]{.underline} [words]{.underline} to that effect [by
suspending]{.underline} \"**[all criminal proceedings]{.underline}**\"
[or]{.underline} \"**[any criminal proceedings]{.underline}**.\"
[Thus]{.underline}, **[the most natural reading]{.underline}** of Rule
20.01 is that it [requires]{.underline} district [courts to
suspend]{.underline} the [proceedings in only the **particular**
case]{.underline} in which it orders the suspension, [not in
**all**]{.underline} prospective [actions]{.underline} that could
possibly arise during the period of suspension.

In its review of the threshold-eligibility requirements in MCL
691.1755(1), [the Court of Appeals aptly recognized that the Legislature
repeatedly used the word]{.underline} \[\*\*440\]
**[\"the\"]{.underline}** [in front of \"crimes,\"]{.underline}
[\"charges,\" and \"judgment of conviction]{.underline}\" in MCL
691.1755(1)(a) to (c) in setting forth when a plaintiff is eligible for
compensation under the WICA. On the other hand, the Legislature uses the
word \"another\" before \"criminal offense\" in MCL 691.1755(1)(b) and
\[\*\*\*27\] \"conviction\" in MCL 691.1755(4)---other subsections of
MCL 691.1755 that explain when a plaintiff is not eligible for
compensation. [We have]{.underline} previously **[defined
\"the\"]{.underline}** [as a \"definite article]{.underline} . . .
([used, especially before a noun,]{.underline} **[with a specifying or
particularizing effect]{.underline}**, [as opposed to]{.underline} the
**[indefinite or generalizing force]{.underline}** of the indefinite
article a or an).\"20Link to the text of the note As an adjective,
\"another\" is defined as \"different or distinct from the one first
considered\"; \"some other\"; or \"being one more in addition to one or
more of the same kind.\"21Link to the text of the note [Accordingly, the
Legislature\'s **use of** **\"the\"**]{.underline} [before \"crimes,\"
\"charges,\" and \"judgment of conviction\" throughout MCL
691.1755(1)(a) to (c)]{.underline} [means]{.underline} [those
provisions]{.underline} **[refer to the specific crimes and
charges]{.underline}** leading to a plaintiff\'s wrongful conviction and
imprisonment that gave rise to a WICA claim. The Legislature\'s use of
\"another\" before \"criminal offense\" in MCL 691.1755(1)(b) and
\"conviction\" in MCL 691.1755(4) \[\*413\] means those provisions refer
to some other offense or conviction that is different or distinct from
the wrongful conviction and imprisonment, and which therefore does not
warrant compensation under the WICA. Thus, MCL 691.1755 reflects the
overall structure of the WICA in only providing compensation for the
specific crimes, charges, or convictions \[\*\*\*28\] that the plaintiff
was wrongfully convicted of and imprisoned for, and which ultimately
form the basis of the WICA claim---not \"another\" crime, charge, or
conviction.
