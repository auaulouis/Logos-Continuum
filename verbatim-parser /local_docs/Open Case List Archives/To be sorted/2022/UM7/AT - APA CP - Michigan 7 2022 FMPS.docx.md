Justice Field, of course, does wind up treating the political branch's
conclusions, in this particular setting, as conclusive on the judiciary
--- but he does not rest that outcome on the idea that immigration
control is a sovereign power outside the reach of the Constitution.
Instead, he offers a statement about institutional roles seen as
appropriate for the respective branches of government in this specific
domain. [In the foreign arena]{.underline}, he writes, [as a matter of
"self-preservation,"]{.underline}34 [the government has the]{.underline}
"highest [duty" to "preserve . . . independence, and]{.underline} give
[**security against foreign aggression** and
**encroachment**]{.underline}."35 To achieve these ends, [the government
is **clothed with authority** to determine the occasion on
which]{.underline} the [powers shall be called forth]{.underline}; and
its determinations, so far as the subjects affected are concerned, are
necessarily conclusive upon all its departments and officers. . . . [The
**existence of [war]{.mark}**]{.underline} would [[render the
necessity]{.underline}]{.mark} of the proceeding only [more obvious and
[pressing]{.mark}]{.underline}. The same necessity, in a less pressing
degree, may arise when war does not exist, and the same authority which
adjudges the necessity in one case must also determine it in the other.
In both cases its determination is conclusive upon the judiciary.36 In
other words, [in 1888, the political branches judged
necessary]{.underline} the application of [a new]{.underline} absolute
[rule excluding Chinese laborers]{.underline}, in order [to **achieve
security** against]{.underline} what Congress deemed a type of [foreign
encroachment]{.underline}.37 [Even with misgivings]{.underline} about
the justice or fairness of the action, [[the courts **will not
second-guess**]{.mark} that judgment]{.underline} of necessity.
[[In]{.mark} realms touching]{.underline} upon [**[foreign
relations]{.mark}** and]{.underline} potential **[national
self-preservation]{.underline}**, Field indicates, [[the nation must
**speak with one voice**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [it is not
for]{.underline} the [courts to introduce a discordant
sound]{.underline}. B. Complexity, Prophecy, and Experimentation in
Foreign Affairs Decisionmaking [Some critics]{.underline} of the plenary
power doctrine [question this]{.underline} asserted [**linkage** between
immigration and foreign affairs]{.underline}. Chinese exclusion was not
a foreign affairs decision, they assert, but one driven by domestic
political considerations --- and in fact it worsened our relations with
China.38 The invocation of foreign affairs is seen as a pretext covering
up uglier motives, and the plenary power doctrine prevents courts from
looking behind the mask.39 Therefore, [some assert that courts
should]{.underline} simply [provide]{.underline} the ordinary measure of
**[constitutional scrutiny]{.underline}** --- to smoke out invidious
motives or at least [to provide an appropriate evaluation
of]{.underline} the weight of [the governmental interest]{.underline} in
light of the individual stake.40 This kind of pre-textual invocation
certainly can occur. But [here is the difficulty: We should not
assume]{.underline} that [pretexts in]{.underline} the [foreign
affairs]{.underline} arena [are readily identifiable]{.underline}. As
Justice Breyer observed in a recent political question case:
[[Decisionmaking in]{.underline}]{.mark} \[the [[foreign
affairs]{.underline}]{.mark}\] area typically [[is]{.mark} highly
political]{.underline}. It is ["[**delicate**" and
"**complex**."]{.mark}]{.underline} [[It]{.underline}]{.mark} often
[[rests upon information]{.underline}]{.mark} readily [[available to the
Executive]{.underline}]{.mark} Branch [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to the
[intelligence committees]{.underline} of [[Congress]{.underline}, [but
**not**]{.underline}]{.mark} readily **[available to [the
courts]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It frequently is highly dependent upon
what Justice Jackson called "prophecy." And [the creation of wise
[foreign policy]{.mark}]{.underline} typically [[lies]{.mark} well
**[beyond]{.mark}**]{.underline} the experience or professional capacity
of **[[a judge]{.underline}]{.mark}**. At the same time, [where foreign
affairs is at issue, the]{.underline} practical [need for the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to speak "with one voice and
ac\[t\] as one," is]{.underline} particularly [important]{.underline}.41
Many of [the nation's policy]{.underline} tools [in [the foreign
arena]{.mark} are crude and imprecise, with uncertain impact.
This]{.underline} very [uncertainty may [require
**trial-and-error**]{.mark}]{.underline} application, [[with]{.mark} a
need for **[quick]{.mark}**]{.underline} policy
**[[changes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially **[[in times of
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Therefore, [**[deference]{.mark}** to the
political branches [is called for]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} not
because we can always be sure that their motives are pure and
nondiscriminatory --- we cannot --- but [because [subjecting
these]{.mark}]{.underline} measures [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} detailed
[[litigation would **interfere with**]{.mark} **the
[flexibility]{.mark}**]{.underline} often [necessary to act beyond our
borders]{.underline}. A too-ready [[judicial interference
would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[**impair our ability** to
deploy]{.underline}]{.mark} uncertain [[tools ---]{.mark} deriving from
**immigration**]{.underline} control, [trade regulation, or]{.underline}
other [components of]{.underline} our [international relations ---
[according to a single]{.mark}]{.underline} unified
[[strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}.42 C. An Example: The Contrast to
Domestic Measures [Consider the **seizure of U.S.
diplomats**]{.underline} by militants [[in Tehran]{.mark} in
1978]{.underline}. After the embassy invasion was ratified and defended
by the new Iranian government, [[the U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline}
government [[turned to]{.mark} a disparate variety of countermeasures
to]{.underline} try to [win release]{.underline} of the American
hostages, [including the [seizure of]{.mark} billions]{.underline} of
dollars [in [assets]{.mark} of Iran]{.underline} and of its companies
and nationals, litigation in [the International Court of Justice,
a]{.underline}n ill-fated [military rescue attempt]{.underline} after
Iran defied the International Court, [[diplomatic
overtures]{.underline}]{.mark} through Algeria,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} certain [[immigration]{.mark}-law-based
[restrictions]{.mark}]{.underline} imposed on Iranian nationals in the
United States.43 There were even proposals at the time to use
immigration or other powers to intern large numbers of Iranian nationals
so they could perhaps be part of an exchange that would bring the
diplomats home.44 Thankfully, such internment was never put into motion.
[Contrast]{.underline} the trial-and-error use of [these]{.underline}
generally **[crude and scattershot measures]{.underline}** [with how the
government would respond to a domestic]{.underline} kidnapping and
potential [hostage situation]{.underline}. The police could deploy
quickly to investigate who seized the victims and where they were
currently located. In that process the authorities could use judicial
search warrants to facilitate the inquiry, plus arrest warrants and
compulsory grand jury subpoenas as appropriate. They could call on a
wide range of assistance and technical support from a host of fully
empowered domestic agencies, state and federal. Once the kidnappers were
located, the police would establish perimeter control around the hostage
site. [No hostile militias would stand in the way]{.underline} (or if
such appeared, other governmental power, including the National Guard,
could be deployed). [In a]{.underline} protracted [standoff, judicially
issued search warrants might help legitimate a]{.underline} forcible
[rescue operation]{.underline}. And [the full weight of]{.underline}
criminal [punishment]{.underline}, imposed [through]{.underline}
efficiently functioning [courts, could be expected]{.underline} for the
kidnappers or hostage takers. [This]{.underline} comparison [helps
reveal why courts are positioned to apply close]{.underline}
constitutional **[scrutiny of]{.underline}** official **[domestic
action]{.underline}**, whenever it is credibly challenged,
[but]{.underline} properly [feel]{.underline} more **[constrained [in
the international arena]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the international
arena, U.S. actors generally cannot invoke compulsory process or other
reliable coercive means under their own government's control. Moreover,
[[the **stakes are**]{.underline}]{.mark} typically
[[**higher**,]{.mark} as is the number]{.underline} of people
[potentially affected]{.underline} --- not only by the immediate outcome
but also by downstream effects, as the resolution either deters similar
adverse actions in the future or instead stimulates them because the
U.S. effort failed. [With a domestic operation, judges can be
confident]{.underline} that [the government will]{.underline} still
[have plenty of capacity to deal with]{.underline} public safety
[threats, even in the presence of]{.underline} robust [judicial review.
One cannot have such confidence]{.underline} [about]{.underline} the
efficacy of alternative policy tools in [the **global arena**
if]{.underline} domestic [judicial action begins to]{.underline} prevent
or **[second-guess or slow down]{.underline}** the use of those
initially chosen by [the political branches]{.underline}. Another
difference between the two settings is relevant. In [the domestic arena,
we do not tolerate]{.underline} individuals using **[tit-for-tat
responses]{.underline}** to remedy wrongful behavior. I cannot justify
seizing and carrying away my neighbor's television on the ground that he
borrowed my riding mower months ago and never returned it. But this
prohibition on messy self-help obtains precisely because efficient
hierarchical legal mechanisms, involving professional police and a
developed court system, stand available to redress my neighbor's
wrongful act. In recent decades, the world has taken limited but hopeful
steps toward investing transnational institutions with comparable
powers, but progress remains quite uneven across different policy
domains. [[The plenary power doctrine **manifests**]{.mark}
**the**]{.underline} Supreme [**Court's [judgment]{.mark}**
[that]{.mark} the]{.underline} kind of [detailed constitutional
[scrutiny]{.mark} appropriate for the]{.underline} mature and developed
[domestic public order [is **not workable in the**]{.mark}]{.underline}
more primitive [**[international]{.mark} legal [system]{.mark}**,
marked]{.underline} primarily [by]{.underline} horizontal
[action-and-response to]{.underline} try to [rectify
breaches]{.underline}. D. The Nongovernmental Component of Foreign
Affairs Decisionmaking [Foreign affairs are involved in **immigration
decisionmaking** for another]{.underline}, more [entangling
reason]{.underline}, even when there is no clear effort to retaliate
against or to influence a foreign government. Most [high-level
immigration decisions]{.underline} --- by Congress or by the executive
branch --- [are designed]{.underline}, at least in part, [to **influence
or shape behavior overseas**]{.underline} by individuals and nonstate
actors, including both prospective immigrants (contemplating either
legal or illegal channels) and smuggling organizations. For example, the
decision (part of Operation Streamline45) to prosecute a high percentage
of simple entrants without inspection caught along the southern border,
causing them to spend some time in jail or prison before being
repatriated, has been criticized as disproportionate to the inherent
nature of this misdemeanor offense.46 But this critique misunderstands
the policy decision. [Operation Streamline is]{.underline} primarily
[meant to send a **deterrent**]{.underline} message [to others
contemplating a]{.underline} future [clandestine
crossing]{.underline}.47 The same is true of decisions to repatriate
violators to a distant part of the land border rather than back to the
border town from which they entered and where their coyote may be
waiting to help them try again to enter.48 To take another example, [in
1994, the Clinton administration decided to decouple]{.underline} the
grant of [work authorization from]{.underline} the simple act of [filing
for asylum]{.underline}, as had been provided under earlier regulations,
[though this]{.underline} change [would mean that]{.underline} many
[applicants would be without]{.underline} a means of
[support]{.underline}, other than private or family charity,
[for]{.underline} as long as [180 days. This]{.underline} austere step
[was taken]{.underline}, in significant part, [to **discourage people**
planning to come to the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to
file an ill-founded claim that]{.underline} previously [would have
secured]{.underline} several [years of residence and lawful
work]{.underline} while they awaited a hearing.49 Changes to the
treatment or opportunities of noncitizens in the United States, whether
in the direction of restriction or liberalization, almost inevitably
affect the decisions of people and organizations abroad who are thinking
about organizing or participating in migration to the United States.
Smuggling organizations, in fact, often build their business plans
around finding and exploiting weak spots in immigration laws or
processes.50 As a result, [some]{.underline} U.S. government [measures
take on a more **severe or restrictive aspect** than]{.underline}
[might]{.underline} [initially]{.underline} seem to [be warranted by
the]{.underline} acts of the [individuals most immediately
affected]{.underline}. This is because the policymakers mean the action
not just for those who are the direct object of enforcement on U.S. soil
but also for the message sent to others they want to deter. [This
dynamic appears to explain]{.underline}, in significant part, [the Obama
administration's decisions to respond to the]{.underline} southwest
[border migration surge]{.underline} in summer of 2014 [with
a]{.underline} surprisingly **[severe set of measures]{.underline}**,
including sustained detention, even though the subjects were mainly
children traveling with a mother or other relative. [The
executive]{.underline} branch [also implemented accelerated removal
processing]{.underline} where the law permitted such action, and assured
substantial publicity for the flight whenever recent migrants were
deported by airplane to their home country.51 Despite sharp criticism,
[these practices]{.underline} persisted, and they [seem to have
had]{.underline} much of [the **desired deterrent impact** in
the]{.underline} foreign [nations at issue]{.underline}. In fact,
monthly arrivals of unaccompanied minors from these countries declined
from 10,631 in June 2014 to 2,432 in September.52 [This]{.underline}
kind of [deterrence-based action]{.underline}, focused on overseas
individuals and nongovernmental players, [is]{.underline} also [an
**aspect of foreign affairs**]{.underline}, even though it falls below
the plane of high-level geopolitics. [It]{.underline} likewise [may need
to take the form of]{.underline} rough-hewn [trial-and-error,
like]{.underline} the more [traditional foreign-relations
actions]{.underline} directed at governments. [The]{.underline} Supreme
[Court's case law]{.underline} over the years [appears to consider such
policy]{.underline} choices **[equally worthy of foreign-affairs
deference]{.underline}**.53 [This]{.underline} analysis [is not meant as
advocacy for]{.underline} the quick or expansive use of [immigration
restrictions to respond to objectionable]{.underline} or unwelcome
[actions]{.underline} of foreign governments or nonstate actors. For
reasons of both policy and proportion, immigration sanctions of this
type should be sparingly deployed. [But the Court's **doctrine of
deference**]{.underline} in Chae Chan Ping and later cases [is based on
the recognition that even for]{.underline} relatively [liberal
foreign-affairs decisionmakers, **rough-hewn actions** that]{.underline}
initially [seem outsized]{.underline} or individually unfair [might need
to be in the mix to **respond to**]{.underline}, or to help shape,
**[actions]{.underline}** that others are taking
**[abroad]{.underline}**.54 III. Why the Court Resists Even Moderate
Proposals for a More Active Judicial Role [A]{.underline} more nuanced
[branch of]{.underline} the Chae Chan Ping [criticism accepts that
foreign affairs considerations may]{.underline} well [be at stake
in]{.underline} some [immigration decisions, but would **modify the
doctrine** to allow for a]{.underline} carefully structured **[closer
judicial look]{.underline}**.55 [The courts]{.underline}, such observers
contend, should not take political branch assertions as controlling, but
instead [should perform an initial judicial probe]{.underline} of the
asserted reasons, [to decide whether the]{.underline} challenged
[immigration restriction rests on]{.underline} [a]{.underline}
significant [foreign affairs foundation]{.underline}. If the answer is
yes, then the reviewing court should treat the political branches'
decision as dispositive --- essentially, as a political question not
subject to judicial review. But if not, then the court should apply
ordinary modes of constitutional review, which might well bring a form
of heightened scrutiny. At first glance, this kind of proposal would
seem to offer an attractive middle ground to the Supreme Court. Yet [the
Court]{.underline} in practice [has **manifested great resistance** to
these]{.underline} scholarly [invitations]{.underline}. Why? In my view,
a majority of the [[Justices harbor]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[deep
**skepticism that lower courts can**]{.mark} **be trusted** to [give
sufficient weight to foreign policy]{.mark} concerns in making any
such]{.underline} threshold [assessment. The]{.underline} very [nature
of immigration litigation]{.underline} in the courts of appeals, with an
actual and often sympathetic human being front and center, [makes
a]{.underline} reviewing [judge]{.underline} far more [likely to
overvalue the]{.underline} individual [interests at stake and undervalue
the]{.underline} more subtle and complex [reasons why a]{.underline}
particular [measure may be **needed for**]{.underline} system
[**stability** or to **influence**]{.underline} behavior [**beyond our
borders** --- connections that]{.underline} often [would not
become]{.underline} fully [apparent until]{.underline} broader damage is
manifested [months or years after an interventionist judicial
decision]{.underline}.56 Anna Law's book, The Immigration Battle in
American Courts, documents this disparity in outlook between the Supreme
Court and the lower courts quite revealingly. She describes "how \[lower
court\] judges can disregard congressional edicts limiting their scope
of review in order to reach a desired result,"57 and can usually get
away with it because the Supreme Court can review only a tiny fraction
of their decisions.58 Professor Law regards this stance by the courts of
appeals as a virtue, but the Supreme Court doubtless views it otherwise.
[[Keeping the]{.mark} plenary power [doctrine **categorical**
gives]{.mark} the]{.underline} Supreme [Court greater [assurance that
lower courts will **preserve**]{.mark} **the space** needed for
government actions to meet]{.underline} real **[[foreign affairs
imperatives]{.underline}]{.mark}** (even if this stance inevitably also
leaves room for some ill-motivated actions adopted by the political
branches). If this symposium were being held at the time of Chae Chan
Ping's centennial, in 1989, we might have had greater reason to expect
some softening by the Supreme Court regarding the deference doctrine in
the foreign affairs arena. Exactly twenty-five years before the week
when this symposium convened in Norman, Oklahoma, the Berlin Wall fell,
signaling that the Soviet bloc was coming apart, about to be replaced,
in many instances, by democratic governments. Lengthy wars were ending
in Latin America, and dictators were being forced from office. [It
appeared we were on the cusp of a]{.underline} far more [**benign world
order** --- one that might permit]{.underline} the rapid flowering of
more [protective international legal institutions and]{.underline}
thereby [reduce reliance on **crude action-and-response**]{.underline}
in the international arena. **[[Today's global scene
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** far more [**[grim]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Not
only has [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[experienced]{.underline} the trauma of [al Qaeda's September 11
attacks]{.underline}, which revealed a genuine need for more vigilant
immigration screening, but [democratic [nations are]{.mark}]{.underline}
also [[facing]{.underline}]{.mark} new [**global threats**
from]{.underline} other [**[nongovernmental actors]{.mark}**
who]{.underline} actually [glorify]{.underline} the use of [beheadings,
crucifixion, and slavery, in addition to]{.underline} other players
using more old-fashioned forms of [**[terrorism]{.mark}** directed at
civilians. **[Failed states]{.mark}** are]{.underline} more
[common]{.underline}, and [well-armed [insurgencies have
**proliferated**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The march of [[**democracy** has
slowed]{.mark} and]{.underline}, in several countries, [reversed.
[**Climate change** and]{.mark}]{.underline} even plague-like
[**[diseases]{.mark}** presage]{.underline} more complicated [foreign
policy challenges, many of which [will have a **migration
dimension**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The risks]{.underline}]{.mark} [to
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [if our government's
foreign-policy]{.underline}-linked [initiatives are
unsuccessful]{.underline}, now [[seem **far
higher**]{.underline}]{.mark} than in 1989. Thus, [I do not foresee
the]{.underline} Supreme [Court retreating significantly
from]{.underline} the strong [deference doctrines]{.underline} derived
from Chae Chan Ping. 59

### 2ac -- judicial oversight bad -- leaks

#### No spillover -- [Congressional exemptions circumvent]{.underline} AND Courts [won't oversee]{.underline} intel gathering procedures -- OR, causes [leaks]{.underline} -- [wrecks ISR]{.underline} capabilities to avoid [compromising sources]{.underline}

Elizabeth **Rindskopf-Parker & Pate 7**, Bryan Pate, 2007, "Rethinking
Judicial Oversight of Intelligence," in Reforming Intelligence:
Obstacles to Democratic Control and Effectiveness,
<https://www.academia.edu/13052951/Reforming_Intelligence>, nihara

To function effectively, all democratic governments must subject their
actions to open public debate, **[review]{.underline}**, discussion, and
response. These [are]{.underline} the [essential ingredients of
**oversight** and **accountability**]{.underline}. Yet, [to survive in
an often **hostile world**,]{.underline} these same [governments
must]{.underline} also [be able to collect, analyze, and use **foreign**
and **domestic intelligence**---information of ongoing value only
insofar as its methods of collection and secrecy can be
maintained]{.underline}. This is the [paradox of intelligence oversight:
the **need to achieve** **open review** of **secret materials** and
activities **without destroying** their **value**]{.underline}.

In the United States, there are many established mechanisms of oversight
and accountability, both inside and outside the government. Under the
U.S. Constitution, the three separate branches of the federal
government---executive, legislative, and judiciary---share power through
a system of checks and balances. Each has the obligation and authority
to ensure that the other two branches perform their assigned functions
appropriately. This tripartite division naturally encourages oversight
and accountability between the branches. In addition, each arm of the
government provides its own unique internal oversight. Within the
executive branch, management reviews are conducted by numerous offices,
each of which typically includes an inspector general and a general
counsel to ensure that it is complying with the law.

Congressional oversight occurs through the appropriations process,
congressional audits, and statutory reporting requirements. Judicial
review of the legality of actions taken by the two political branches
occurs frequently, with judgments rendered on a case-by-case basis.
Outside the government, the actions of each branch are subjected to
scrutiny by an independent and active press and are ultimately adjudged
by the electorate through the democratic process.

Yet, [for the **national intelligence** system]{.underline}, these
[**traditional oversight** mechanisms are an **awkward
fit**]{.underline}. Perhaps [this is part of the reason
why]{.underline}, historically, [oversight of intelligence has been
**uneven**]{.underline} in its success. Often, the [importance of
maintaining **secrecy**]{.underline} to protect the sources and methods
of the intelligence capabilities [appears **directly opposed** to the
**effective functioning** of the **existing oversight**
structures.]{.underline} Moreover, the [secrecy surrounding intelligence
activities seems to limit the role of the press to reporting on periodic
**scandals**]{.underline}---some real, some not. Some critics argue that
the broader goals of oversight---the [**effectiveness** of the overall
**intelligence system**---are **inadequately served**]{.underline} by
the current system.1

[Secrecy concerns have also **restricted** the **judiciary's role** in
reviewing intelligence activities]{.underline}. For good reason, [court
procedures]{.underline} in a democracy [**do not** easily
**accommodate** secrecy. **Uncomfortable** with **secret procedures**,
the **judiciary** has been **reluctant** to engage issues arising from
intelligence activities]{.underline}, even when such matters are
properly presented to them.2 There is an important corollary to the
concerns of the judiciary: [**judicial openness** is commonly seen by
all branches of government as a **threat** to effective **intel**ligence
**gathering**]{.underline}. Thus, because [**revealing** individual
**secret facts** can **threaten** the underlying ''**sources** and
methods'' by which substantial amounts of intelligence are produced,
**legislated exceptions** to public **legal review** are common where
intelligence information is involved.]{.underline} Most notable in this
regard is the exception for foreign intelligence contained in the
Freedom of Information Act---the primary statute providing
accountability through citizen access to government information.3

[In a few of the areas where intelligence issues inevitably come under
the purview of the judiciary, **Congress** has **stepped in** to
**strike the balance** between competing concerns]{.underline}. For
example, to facilitate the adjudication of criminal [trials that involve
critical evidence that **cannot be made publicly
available**]{.underline}, Congress has [established the **C**lassified
**I**nformation **P**rocedures **A**ct (**CIPA**]{.underline}).4 CIPA is
modeled on earlier protective orders fashioned by the judiciary to
handle such problems and provides a procedure for the courts to follow
in handling classified evidence during a public trial. It is the means
Congress has chosen to achieve the dual objectives of protecting
national security and ensuring defendants a fair trial.

**[Procedural provisions]{.underline}** like CIPA, however, [have not
alleviated the **fundamental impediment**]{.underline} to greater
judicial involvement in the review of intelligence activities: [an
**overriding reluctance** on the part of the **judiciary** to become
**involved** with **foreign affairs** and **national security
concerns**]{.underline}. Is this resistance inevitable and unavoidable?
Or are there structures that exist now, or could be devised, that would
allow greater oversight by the courts in the overall process of
collecting, analyzing, and using intelligence?

These questions are particularly timely as terrorism places the national
security structures under increasing pressure to respond in new ways
both at home and abroad. With headlines exposing abused detainees,
''torture memos,'' race-based ''no-fly lists,'' and ''illegal
wiretapping,'' it is evident that the traditional balance between
national security and individual liberty is being challenged, making
even more important the courts' role in ensuring that responses to
terrorism do not fundamentally degrade personal freedoms and
liberties.What role should the courts have in intelligence oversight in
a time of terrorism? Before considering this question, we will first
review the origins of existing oversight structures; then we will
examine the basis for the judiciary's reluctance to participate in
national security matters; and finally, we will consider one example of
active judicial oversight that may presage future approaches, especially
if terrorism continues to pose a credible threat beyond the foreseeable
future.

#### Independently, miscalc from [ISR failure]{.underline} escalates to [full-scale]{.underline} nuclear war -- [nothing]{.underline} checks

Dr. Bruce G. **Blair 20**, Research Scholar in the Program on Science
and Global Security at Princeton University, PhD in Operations Research
from Yale University, "Loose Cannons: The President and US Nuclear
Posture", Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Volume 76, Issue 1
\[language modified; abbreviation in brackets\]

[The **fog** of nuclear conflict will prove]{.underline} all the
**[thick]{.underline}**er [because leaders and [planners
**lack**]{.mark} **adequate [knowledge]{.mark}**
[about]{.mark}]{.underline} their [[adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark}'
mind-set, resolve, wartime aims, and [game plans]{.underline}. For
instance, de-classified Soviet documents show clearly that the US
strategy of "escalation dominance" was completely out of sync with
Soviet nuclear strategy and that escalation to full-scale nuclear war
was virtually inevitable if the United States struck first.13 After many
decades of scholarly research, it is still not known what leaders in
Moscow and Beijing were thinking during Cold War crises involving US
attempts to threaten nuclear violence to coerce them.14 Today it would
be foolhardy in the extreme to presume we would know Putin's, Xi's, and
Kim's minds and behavior in wartime. A prudent leader would not only
refrain from initiating the actual use of nuclear weapons because of the
danger of escalation; that leader would also refrain from brandishing
them at all during a confrontation. [The **[fear of]{.mark} an adversary
[striking]{.mark} first** [is]{.mark} the leading **[textbook]{.mark}
cause** of **[crisis instability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To stabilize a
military crisis situation, what is actually needed is predictability and
reassurance that first use is not on the table. For many strategists,
however, taking options off the table looks like weakness. Retired Gen.
James Mattis (the recent defense secretary) has a favorite military
maxim: "Never tell the enemy what you are not going to do." Strategists
weaned on Thomas Schelling's classic game theory arguments believe
threatening, manipulating risk, and blackmailing are the currency of
savvy crisis diplomacy. And it is certainly true that [past US
presidents have regularly played nuclear
**brinks**]{.underline}~~man~~**[ship]{.underline}** with the Soviets
and Chinese [and displayed **incautious risk-taking** in their crisis
maneuvering]{.underline}. This was in fact the playbook of the Nixon
advisors who ordered the world-wide nuclear alert that my crewmate and I
helped implement in 1973. This alert sent a provocative message to the
Soviets: The United States was prepared to play nuclear roulette to gets
its way.15 [[**Nuclear roulette** begins]{.mark} at the outset of a
crisis as the [belligerents **intensify**]{.mark} **their
[\[ISR\]]{.mark}**]{.underline} intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance **[operations]{.underline}**. The aim is to maintain
"situation awareness," but [the activities lend themselves to the
**worst-case interpretation** that the adversary is updating its
targeting in **preparing to strike**. Similarly, nuclear forces and
command structures are **programmed to go to higher readiness** to
prepare for war if the adversary will not back down]{.underline}.
[Although]{.underline} the [**motives** may be **[defensive]{.mark}**,
these **[activities]{.mark}**]{.underline} may appear to be precursors
of a first strike and [[provoke]{.mark} an [**action-reaction
spiral**]{.mark} that **[spins out of control]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Certainly, [if even a **single**]{.underline} nuclear [weapon were
**use**d]{.underline}, the strategic nuclear forces on both sides would
move rapidly to a maximum war footing and project credible mutual
threats of large-scale preemptive attack. In sum, a nuclear posture
gearing up for a possible enemy first strike [risks
becoming]{.underline} a **[self-fulfilling]{.underline}** prophecy. From
the perspective of presidential decision making, the
[first-use]{.underline} contingency [could easily accelerate
**escalation**]{.underline} to the point of causing mental duress.
[This]{.underline} contingency [is]{.underline} also [notable for its
[**absence of guardrails**]{.mark} and the **[ease]{.mark}** with which
[a **misguided**]{.mark} or rattled [president could **order**]{.mark}
it]{.underline}. The launch protocol described earlier for [**launch on
warning** applies]{.underline} equally to first use. Although the
timeline could be extended greatly, the president could choose at any
time to end the discussion and order a strike. During the Cold War, I
seldom practiced executing a first strike, and today there are no
foreseeable scenarios that would justify transgressing the nuclear taboo
of first use. Nevertheless, a first nuclear strike remains the default
contingency of the US posture, owing to the huge uncertainties
surrounding the alternatives -- second-strike retaliation and launch on
warning. A crisis that brings the belligerents to the brink of nuclear
war would compel consideration of first use. Nuclear warfighters who
reject the adage that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be
fought may well brief and tout the purported warfighting advantages of
going first. Even though first use runs counter to and undermines the
entire framework of the global nuclear order, in which nuclear weapons
exist only to deter, leaders may waver if it seems the least fraught
choice at the moment of truth. An impulsive president may be drawn to
it. Wiser advisors may counsel restraint, but nothing would stand in the
way of the president ordering a first strike. [The]{.underline} likely
if not [[**inevitable** consequence]{.mark} of attacking a nuclear
adversary with nuclear weapons [is nuclear **retal**]{.mark}iation and
**uncontrolled [escalation]{.mark}** []{.mark}that crosses the threshold
of acceptable damage to this nation. First use [runs an **existential
risk**]{.mark} to the]{.underline} United States and [the world. It
carries a huge risk of triggering a **nuclear exchange** of
**cataclysmic proportions**]{.underline} with massive casualties to all
the belligerent parties and beyond.

The effect of most leaked information, however, is not nearly so clear
as these extreme hypotheticals. Pozen recently argued that the
government has deliberately chosen not to punish leakers because while
individual leaks may be harmful to government interests, leaks as a
whole are more beneficial than detrimental.92 A permissive attitude
toward leaks allows the government to credibly "plant" information in
the press, and promotes the public's belief in the legitimacy of the
government, compensating for an overbroad classification system.93 The
focus of Pozen's analysis, however, is the much more common, everyday
leaks of higher-level government officials, and Pozen acknowledges that
some leaks can be truly harmful.94 Citing Chelsea Manning's disclosures
to WikiLeaks as a "rare undeniable leak"95 of the unauthorized nature,
Pozen concedes that [even a permissive approach to leakiness "cannot

#### Shoring up the democratic model [cascades]{.underline} and prevents a [global]{.underline} erosion to authoritarianism that causes [nuclear war]{.underline}

Dr. Larry **Diamond 19**, Professor of Political Science and Sociology
at Stanford University, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Senior
Fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, PhD in
Sociology from Stanford University, Ill Winds: Saving Democracy from
Russian Rage, Chinese Ambition, and American Complacency, p. 199-202

[The most obvious response to the **ill winds blowing** from the world's
autocracies is to help the winds of freedom blowing in the **other
direction**]{.underline}. The [democracies]{.underline} of the West
cannot [save themselves if they do not **stand with democrats** around
the world]{.underline}.

[This is truer now than ever]{.underline}, for several reasons. [We live
in a globalized world, one in which **models**]{.underline}, trends, and
ideas [**cascade** across borders. Any wind of change may gather
**quickly** and blow with **gale force**. People everywhere **form
ideas** about how to govern]{.underline}---or simply about which forms
of government and sources of power may be irresistible---[based on what
they **see happening elsewhere**. We are now immersed in a fierce
**global contest of ideas**, information, and norms]{.underline}. In the
digital age, that contest is moving at lightning speed, shaping how
people think about their political systems and the way the world runs.
[As **doubts** about and **threats** to democracy are **mounting** in
the West, this is not a contest that the democracies can afford to
lose]{.underline}.

Globalization, with its flows of trade and information, raises the
stakes for us in another way. Authoritarian and badly governed regimes
increasingly pose a direct threat to popular sovereignty and the rule of
law in our own democracies. Covert flows of money and influence are
subverting and corrupting our democratic processes and institutions.
They will not stop just because Americans and others pretend that we
have no stake in the future of freedom in the world. If we want to
defend the core principles of self-government, transparency, and
accountability in our own democracies, we have no choice but to promote
them globally.

It is not enough to say that dictatorship is bad and that democracy,
however flawed, is still better. Popular enthusiasm for a lesser evil
cannot be sustained indefinitely. People need the inspiration of a
positive vision. Democracy must demonstrate that it is a just and fair
political system that advances humane values and the common good.

To make our republics more perfect, established democracies must not
only adopt reforms to more fully include and empower their own citizens.
They must also support people, groups, and institutions struggling to
achieve democratic values elsewhere. The best way to counter Russian
rage and Chinese ambition is to show that Moscow and Beijing are on the
wrong side of history; that people everywhere yearn to be free; and that
they can make freedom work to achieve a more just, sustainable, and
prosperous society.

In our networked age, both idealism and [the harder imperatives of
**global**]{.underline} power and [**security** argue for more
democracy, not less]{.underline}. For one thing, [if we do not worry
about]{.underline} the [quality of governance]{.underline} in
lower-income countries, [we will face more and more **troubled and
failing states**. **Famine** and **genocide** are the curse of
authoritarian states, not democratic ones. Outright **state collapse**
is the ultimate, bitter fruit of tyranny. When countries like **Syria**,
**Libya**, and **Afghanistan** descend into **civil war**; when poor
states in Africa cannot generate jobs and improve their citizens' lives
due to rule by corrupt and callous strongmen; when Central American
societies are held hostage by brutal gangs and kleptocratic rulers,
people flee---and wash up on the shores of the democracies]{.underline}.
Europe and the United States cannot withstand the rising pressures of
immigration unless they work to support better, more stable and
accountable government in troubled countries. [The world
has]{.underline} simply [grown too small]{.underline}, too flat, and too
fast [to **wall off**]{.underline} rotten [states]{.underline} and
pretend they are on some other planet.

[**Hard security interests** are at stake]{.underline}. As even the
Trump administration's 2017 National Security Strategy makes clear, [the
**main threats**]{.underline} to U.S. national security [all stem from
**authoritarianism**, whether in the form of tyrannies from **Russia**
and **China** to **Iran** and **North Korea** or in the guise of
antidemocratic terrorist movements such as **ISIS**]{.underline}.1 [By
supporting the development of democracy around the world, we can deny
these authoritarian adversaries the **geopolitical running room** they
seek]{.underline}. Just as Russia, China, and Iran are trying to
undermine democracies to bend other countries to their will, so too can
[we **contain**]{.underline} these [autocrats' ambitions by
helping]{.underline} other countries [build effective]{.underline},
resilient [democracies]{.underline} that can withstand the dictators'
malevolence.

Of course, democratically elected governments with open societies will
not support the American line on every issue. But no free society wants
to mortgage its future to another country. The American national
interest would best be secured by a pluralistic world of free
countries---one in which autocrats can no longer use corruption and
coercion to gobble up resources, alliances, and territory.

If you look back over our history to see who has posed a threat to the
United States and our allies, it has always been authoritarian regimes
and empires. As political scientists have long noted, [no two
democracies have ever gone to **war** with each other---ever. It is not
the democracies of the world that are supporting international
**terrorism**, proliferating **w**]{.underline}eapons of
**[m]{.underline}**ass **[d]{.underline}**estruction, [or threatening
the territory of their neighbors]{.underline}.

For all these reasons, [we need a new global campaign for
freedom]{.underline}. Everything I am proposing in this book plays a
role in that campaign, but in this chapter, I am concerned more narrowly
with the ways that we can directly advance democracy, human rights, and
the rule of law in the twenty-first-century world.

As with any policy area, many of the challenges can be somewhat
technical, requiring smart design and the careful management of programs
and institutions. Those operational debates I leave for another venue.
Here, I make a more basic case for four imperatives. First, we must
support the democrats of the world---the people and organizations
struggling to create and improve free and accountable government.
Second, we must support struggling and developing democracies, helping
them to grow their economies and strengthen their institutions. Third,
we must pressure authoritarian regimes to stop abusing the rights and
stealing the resources of their citizens, including by imposing
sanctions on dictators to make them think hard about their choices and
separate them from both their supporters and the people at large.
Finally, we need to reboot our public diplomacy---our global networks of
information and ideas---for today's fast-paced age of information and
disinformation. [For the sake of]{.underline} both [our
interests]{.underline} and our values, [we need a **foreign policy**
that puts a **high priority** on democracy]{.underline}, human rights,
and the rule of law.

### 2ac -- deterrence !

#### Leaks wreck nuclear deterrence

Rachel Elizabeth **Whitlark 19**, Political scientist and assistant
professor of international affairs at the Georgia Institute of
Technology, "5. Should Presidential Command Over Nuclear Launch Have
Limitations? In A Word, No.," Texas National Security Review, 7-2-2019,
https://tnsr.org/roundtable/policy-roundtable-nuclear-first-use-and-presidential-authority/

While passing a law to require congressional or military-legal approval
before a nuclear launch could take place may seek to address fears of an
unjustified attack, taking such steps would be misguided. Specifically,
it would introduce **[complexity]{.underline}** [and
dangerous]{.underline} **[time delays]{.underline}** that
[would]{.underline}, as an unintended consequence, [**undermine
deterrence**, the]{.underline} quintessential **[purpose of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. That said, there are ways to build more
oversight of the president's nuclear authority while still maintaining
the critical deterrence mission.

Presidential Authority

From the moment consideration begins, a president can launch nuclear
weapons in mere minutes. To initiate the process, the president
discusses the situation with key members of the defense establishment,
including the secretary of defense, the head of U.S. Strategic Command
(responsible for strategic nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal), and the
combatant commanders whose geographical jurisdictions might be relevant
to the mission at hand. As a group, these individuals are critical for
discussing attack plans and targeting, as well as for offering advice
and counsel to the president, who alone must make the eventual
determination for how to proceed. Embedded in the deliberations are
legal considerations, as the military personnel are bound by the Law of
Armed Conflict,89 which demands necessity, distinction (between civilian
and military targets), and proportionality for any use of force. As
such, legal expertise is woven into military activities, including
nuclear missions, from the planning stage to the execution. From the
initial deliberation, if an order is given, it is verified by the
Department of Defense and communicated to the relevant launch crews, who
carry it out.90

Two sets of actors seem to be missing from or lacking formal roles in
this process. The first is Congress. For foreign and military matters,
the U.S. Constitution deliberately enshrined a system of shared powers
between the executive and legislative branches.91 Article I gives
Congress the power to declare war, raise and support armies, and provide
and maintain navies. Article II reserves the role of commander-in-chief
of the Army and the Navy for the office of the president. While only
Congress can declare war, presidents have repeatedly ordered forces into
action without congressional approval. Likewise, although the
Constitution is silent on nuclear matters for obvious reasons, the
president's commander-in-chief authority has extended to control over
nuclear use. One key motivation for this policy follows from the
founders' desire to enshrine civilian control over the military. Nuclear
authority specifically derives from World War II, when the president's
commander-in-chief authority extended, by default, to Harry Truman's
nuclear launch decision in 1945.92 Since then, when issues have arisen
regarding which war powers of the president are beyond congressional
control, little has been resolved, perhaps because the judiciary has
been wary of wading too far into this debate.93

In light of this lack of a formal role for Congress in nuclear command
authority, on Jan. 29, 2019, Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Ted W. Lieu
reintroduced a bill first brought forward during the Obama
administration that seeks to prevent the president from launching a
nuclear first strike without congressional approval.94 There are 82
House co-sponsors and 13 in the Senate. Functionally, the bills seek to
legally prohibit the president from using nuclear weapons without first
determining that an enemy has launched a nuclear attack against the
United States. Absent such a determination, the launch of nuclear
weapons must be preceded by a congressional declaration of war that
explicitly authorizes nuclear use.

The second set of actors without a formal role in the process is the
secretary of defense and the attorney general. In light of this, a
second proposal, authored by Columbia University professors Richard
Betts and Matthew Waxman, supports requiring additional authentication
of a presidential order to use nuclear weapons,95 and does so by
formalizing a role for the defense and legal leadership. Betts and
Waxman advocate two added layers of verification. First, the defense
secretary, or her/his designee, would certify that the order to launch
nuclear weapons was valid, i.e., that it was actually from the
commander-in-chief. Second, the attorney general, or her/his designee,
would certify the order was legal. Through these measures, the defense
and legal authorities would have a formal role beyond their current
advisory capacity.

Dangerous Limitations

Beyond constitutional concerns, there are substantive reasons to be
skeptical of limiting presidential authority in this arena.
Specifically, [from a]{.underline} **[national security
perspective]{.underline}**, it is useful to have the ability to conduct
war in the hands of a single person because of the relative speed with
which one actor can mobilize when compared to the speed of 535 people.
[When threats manifest]{.underline}, it is often the case that speed and
**[secrecy]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} **[paramount
considerations]{.underline}** [for a state deciding how to respond. To
that end, national security decisions like]{.underline} **[mobilizing
for war]{.underline}** [could]{.underline} **[suffer]{.underline}** [---
through]{.underline} **[leaks]{.underline}** and lengthy discussion and
debate --- if they must occur within the halls of Congress. Speed,
[**stealth**, and]{.underline} **[nimble deliberations]{.underline}**
[can be]{.underline} **[incredibly important]{.underline}** [for
executing]{.underline} [**foreign policy and military operations**. This
remains the case both for consideration of]{.underline} **[nuclear
strikes]{.underline}** [as well as for]{.underline}
**[conventional]{.underline}** [scenarios, as these features are
**central to deterrence**]{.underline}. **[Any changes]{.underline}**
[to the existing system that]{.underline} could **[undermine
deterrence]{.underline}** [should be]{.underline}
**[avoided]{.underline}**.

Less Secure," E-International Relations, 10/4/2016,
https://www.e-ir.info/2016/10/04/a-no-first-use-policy-would-make-the-united-states-less-secure/

The very term "no-first-use" is misleading. While a nuclear weapon has
not been used in anger for over 70 years, nuclear weapons are used every
single day to deter large-scale conventional and nuclear attacks. Former
Air Force Chief of Staff General Larry Welch points out that "we have
used the nuclear forces every second of every day for 50 years."
Moreover, [during]{.underline} those [50 years, humankind has
experienced the **most peaceful period in its history**]{.underline} [as
measured by the number of conflict-related casualties as a proportion of
the world's population. This is due in large part to the
devastating]{.underline} **[risks]{.underline}** [that nuclear weapons
pose to any society that is attacked with them]{.underline}. For the
United States and the Soviet Union, a large-scale nuclear exchange meant
the end of society as Americans and Russians had known it. [That risk
led American and Soviet leaders to exercise]{.underline} a level of
**[caution]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[restraint]{.underline}**
that was not exercised by German, Japanese, and other world leaders in
the years leading up to World War II.

If the United States were to adopt a no-first-use policy, the perceived
threat of nuclear conflict admittedly would decline. While [a decline in
the]{.underline} **[perceived threat]{.underline}** [of nuclear weapons
use]{.underline} may seem like a good thing, however, it
[is]{.underline} actually **[dangerous]{.underline}**
[because]{.underline} it is [that]{.underline} **[very perceived
threat]{.underline}** that [gives leaders who may be]{.underline}
**[contemplating]{.underline}** the use of **[force]{.underline}** [the
chance for]{.underline} **[second thoughts]{.underline}**
[that]{.underline} can **[prevent great-power war]{.underline}**. This
is an important point. [Opening the door to great-power conflict, even
if]{.underline} [**ever so slightly**, is]{.underline}
**[obviously]{.underline}** a step in the **[wrong]{.underline}**
direction.

[Nor are great-power conflicts the]{.underline} **[only]{.underline}**
[dangerous challenge that nuclear weapons deter.]{.underline}
[**Biological**, **chemical**, and even well-organized and
targeted]{.underline} [**cyber**-attacks can be]{.underline} **[as
devastating]{.underline}** [as nuclear attacks]{.underline}. Some
proponents may claim that the combination of a no-first-use policy and
American conventional superiority plays to America's strength, but
recent history suggests that simply using our conventional forces rarely
achieves our political objectives. It is also worth noting that the U.S.
military is overstretched and on the verge of a readiness crisis. In the
European theater, for example, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
forces are judged by many to be insufficient to counter  a Russian
military advance into the Baltics. Most important, [the point of
deterrence is to]{.underline} **[prevent]{.underline}** a
**[war]{.underline}** **[from happening]{.underline}**, which is
frequently preferable to becoming engaged in a war even if one wins at
the end of the day.

Today?", Nação e Defesa, p. 11-14

In Russia, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea or Israel, the relevance
of nuclear deterrence is hardly questioned. However, in Western
countries, [nuclear deterrence has been the target of **criticism** on
strategic, legal and moral grounds]{.underline} since 1945. [In the past
decade, the renewed **debate** on nuclear disarmament has been
accompanied by an increase in such criticism. Efforts]{.underline} led
[by]{.underline} four US statesmen, or [the]{.underline} more [radical
Global Zero movement]{.underline}, as well as various diplomatic
initiatives, [have been accompanied by a flurry of new, serious
**academic studies** questioning the legitimacy of nuclear weapons. More
than ever, nuclear deterrence is attacked by]{.underline} many, both on
[the Left]{.underline} and on the Right. To the traditional arguments
related to the credibility of nuclear deterrence are now added two other
factors. First, nuclear weapons, it is argued, have limited value
vis-à-vis proliferation and terrorism, and such risks bolster the case
for nuclear disarmament. Second, alternatives such as high-precision
conventional means and missile defense are said to now be much more
effective than they were in the past. This paper refutes these arguments
on the grounds that nuclear deterrence has proven to be an effective war
prevention instrument, that it is cost-effective, and that today's
challenges confirm its relevance.

Nuclear Weapons Have Been Effective War-Prevention Tools

It is by definition impossible to prove that deterrence has worked, and
correlation is not causality. [But History gives us **solid arguments**
in support of the positive role played by nuclear weapons, especially
since our "database" now covers nearly 70 years]{.underline}.

[Firstly, no major power conflict has taken place in nearly **70
years**. The role of nuclear deterrence to explain this **historical
anomaly**]{.underline} has been highlighted by leading historians and
authors such as John Lewis Gaddis, Kenneth Waltz, and Michael Quinlan.3
[No comparable period of time has ever existed in the history of States.
There were two dozen conflicts among major powers in the equivalent
amount of time following the Treaties of Westphalia]{.underline} (1648),
[and several after the Vienna Congress]{.underline} (1815).4

[Secondly, there has never been a direct military conflict between two
nuclear States]{.underline}. Beyond this mere observation, two
[**studies** have shown that the possession of nuclear weapons by two
countries **significantly reduced**]{.underline} [the likelihood of war
between them (Pasley, 2008; Rauchhaus, 2009)]{.underline}. [Events in
Asia since 1949 provide an interesting test case. China and India fought
a war in 1962, but have refrained from resorting to arms against each
other ever since. There were three India-Pakistan wars]{.underline}
(1962, 1965 and 1971) [before both countries became nuclear; but since
the late 1980s]{.underline} (when the two countries acquired a minimum
nuclear capability), [none of the two has launched any significant air
or land operations against the other]{.underline}.

*Thirdly, no nuclear-armed country has ever been invaded*. This
proposition too can be tested by the evolution of regional crises.
Israel had been invaded in 1948, on the day of its independence. But [in
1973, Arab States deliberately limited]{.underline} their [operations to
disputed territories]{.underline} (the Sinai and the Golan Heights).7
[It is thus incorrect to take the example of the Yom Kippur war as a
"proof" of the failure of nuclear deterrence]{.underline}. Likewise,
India refrained from penetrating Pakistani territory at the occasion of
the crises of 1990, 1999, 2002 and 2008, whereas it had done so in 1965
and 1971. [Another example]{.underline} is sometimes [mistakenly
counted]{.underline} as a failure of nuclear deterrence: [the Falklands
War]{.underline} (1982). [But this was a British Dependent Territory for
which nothing indicated that it was covered by nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}. Furthermore, it would be erroneous to take
these two events as evidence that extended deterrence does not make
sense, as some authors have done ("if nuclear weapons cannot protect
part of the national territory, how could they protect a foreign
country?"8). Extended deterrence is meant to cover interests that are
much more important to the protector than nonessential territories; for
instance, during the Cold war Germany was much more "vital" to the
United States than, say, Puerto Rico.

*Fourthly, no country covered by a nuclear guarantee has ever been the
target of a major State attack*. Here again evidence is hard to give,
but can be found a contrario. [The **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [refrained from invading Cuba]{.underline} in
1962, for instance, [but did not hesitate in invading Grenada, Panama or
Iraq. The Soviet Union invaded Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan,
but not a single US ally]{.underline}. China has refrained from invading
Taiwan, which benefits from a US defense commitment. North Korea invaded
its southern neighbor in 1950 after Washington had excluded it from its
"defensive perimeter", but has refrained from doing so since Seoul has
been covered with a nuclear guarantee. Neither South Vietnam nor Kuwait
were under the US nuclear umbrella. Russia could afford to invade
Georgia because its country was not a NATO member. A partial exception
is the shelling of Yeongpyeong island (2011); but the limited character
of the attack and its location (in a maritime area not recognized by
Pyongyang as being part of South Korean territory) make it hard to count
it as a major failure of extended deterrence.

Alternative Explanations Are Not Satisfying

[Some]{.underline} have [suggested alternative explanations
which]{.underline} all [rest]{.underline}, to some extent,
[on]{.underline} the idea that international society has undergone major
transformations since 1945: the development of international
[institutions]{.underline}, the progress of [democracy]{.underline}, the
rise of [global trade, etc.]{.underline}, to which is often added the
memories of the Second World War. Thus for authors such as John Mueller,
nuclear weapons played a marginal -- non-necessary -- role in the
preservation of peace.9 The Soviet Union, it is also argued, was a
status quo power in Europe which would not have taken the risk of a
major war on the continent.

[But such explanations are **not satisfying**. The rise of]{.underline}
international [trade]{.underline} from 1870 onwards [did not prevent the
First World War]{.underline}: Norman Angell's "Great Illusion" was a
fallacy. The construction of [a new global order based on the League of
Nations did not prevent the Second]{.underline}.10 Kenneth Waltz reminds
us that "in a conventional world even forceful and tragic lessons have
proved to be exceedingly difficult for states to learn".11 In the same
vein, Elbridge Colby holds that such cultural argumentation "markedly
overestimates the durability of historically contingent value systems
while seriously downplaying the enduring centrality of competition,
fear, uncertainty and power".12 Major powers have continued to use
military force in deadly conflicts, especially in the two decades after
1945: "war fatigue" is a limited and rather recent phenomenon. As for
[democratization]{.underline}, it [is obviously a red herring: during
the Cold war, the risk of major war was between pro-Western]{.underline}
(not all of them democratic until at least the late 1970s) [and
totalitarian regimes]{.underline}.

No one knows how a "non-nuclear cold war" would have unfolded in Europe.
However, without nuclear weapons, Washington might have hesitated to
guarantee the security in Europe ("no nukes, no troops"), and might have
returned to isolationism; and without US protection, the temptation for
Moscow to grab territory in Western Europe would have been stronger. And
as Michael Quinlan puts it, in order [to claim that nuclear deterrence
was key in the preservation of peace, one does **not need** to postulate
a Soviet desire for expansionist aggression: it is enough to argue that
"had armed conflict not been so manifestly intolerable the **ebb and
flow of friction** might have **managed with less caution**, and a
**slide sooner or later into major war**, on the pattern of 1914 or
1939, might have been less unlikely]{.underline}".14

Alternative explanations might not even suffice to explain the absence
of conflict among European countries: the integration process which
began in 1957 and culminated with the creation of the European Union in
1991 might have been much more difficult without the US umbrella.15
Neither are they satisfying regarding regional powers. It is hard to
believe that the political, economic and cultural factors mentioned
above are enough to explain the absence of a major conventional war
involving Israel, India or Pakistan since these countries have become
nuclear powers.16

[Deterrence has limited the **scope** and **intensity** of conflict
among the major States. If **crises** in **Europe**, as well as wars in
**Asia** and the **Middle East**, did not turn into **global
conflicts**, it is probably **due largely to nuclear weapons**. The fear
of nuclear war and the **precautions** taken by decisionmakers during
the Cold war to **reduce the risks of direct conflict** have been made
clear by a collective study that contradicts Mueller's
thesis]{.underline} (Gaddis, Gordon, May and Rosenberg, 1999).3

A former Russian official even writes:

> I dare claim and am ready to prove that nuclear weapons were the
> greatest 'civilizing tool' for these elites. They cleansed their ranks
> of all radicals and ideologues, and they strengthened the pragmatists
> who saw their main goal in averting a nuclear war or the
> [clashes]{.underline} that [had the potential to **escalate** to a
> nuclear conflict]{.underline}. 18

One could go as far as saying that [the international stability obtained
thanks to nuclear deterrence]{.underline} (in its national and extended
forms) [has been a form of **"global common good"**. For all non-nuclear
weapons States benefitted from it during the past 65-plus years -- even
though some]{.underline} of them [suffered from]{.underline} the
[indirect conflicts]{.underline} made possible by the
stability-instability paradox. [Without it]{.underline}, for instance,
[it is dubious that Asia would have known the peace and stability that
allowed for its massive transformation and development, leading to
hundreds of millions of human beings being lifted out of
poverty]{.underline}. Patrick Morgan adds that nuclear weapons may even
have hastened the end of the Cold war, by giving confidence to Soviet
leaders that the country's survival would be assured even after the loss
of the Eastern European *glacis*.19

#### [Ongoing]{.underline} conflict in Korea, Taiwan, the Middle East, and Europe will [escalate]{.underline} to great power [nuclear war]{.underline} without deterrence

Peter **Huessy 16**, Director of Strategic Deterrent Studies at the
Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, President of GeoStrategic
Analysis, Graduated from the Columbia University School of International
Affairs and School of Law, Degrees in Anthropology, International
Relations and National Security Policy from Beloit College, "The Case
for a 21st Century Deterrent", Gatestone Institute, 3-22,
https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/7628/modern-nuclear-deterrent

In light of recent geostrategic developments, [some]{.underline} former
U.S. defense experts [are calling for the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [dramatically to curtail its nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}.

These experts assume that the deterrent value of nuclear weapons is
waning and that since the it spends far more on overall defense than do
other nations, the U.S. can afford to cut back in this area.\[2\]

But [are such recommendations unwise? **Absolutely**]{.underline}.

A former U.S. Chief of Naval Operations produced [a chart]{.underline}
some years ago [show]{.underline}ing [annual deaths per capita prior to
the nuclear age]{.underline}, in an era [when only conventional
deterrence existed. Surprisingly, after]{.underline} the atomic bombs
were dropped on [Hiroshima]{.underline} and Nagasaki, [the **worldwide
per capita death toll** from armed conflict during the next half-century
dropped 80%, and during the next seventy years, by **more than
90%**]{.underline}.\[3\]

[In the half-century before 1945, two conventional world wars were
fought, which included the **use of chemical weapons** and the
**fire-bombing of cities**. Add to that devastation the]{.underline}
deaths from the [**Nazi Holocaust** and the mass **murders committed in
the USSR by Stalin**]{.underline} and his successors, and it is clear
that hostile behavior by states was the norm even before the nuclear
age.

Retired General Brent Scowcroft, National Security Advisor to two U.S.
Presidents, once remarked that [the two world wars were a testament to
the **fragility** of traditional conventional
deterrence]{.underline}.\[4\]

[Since 1945, however, **large-scale war between nuclear-armed powers**
has been avoided. That is not to say that there have been no conflicts
between states]{.underline}. The fight between totalitarianism and
freedom took the form of a cross-border war in Korea, subversion and
guerilla warfare in Vietnam, and state-sponsored terrorism in Africa,
Central America and the Middle East, to name just a few. The fight
continues today, in the post-Cold War era, despite the \"end of
history\" narrative that promised armed conflict would pretty much
end.\[5\]

Potential [**major conflicts**, however, still are **prevented** by the
U.S. nuclear deterrent: on the **Korean peninsula**; between **China and
Taiwan**; in the **Middle East** and in **Eastern Europe**]{.underline}.

[Conflict continues]{.underline}, of course, [in the form of **Iranian
and North Korean** terrorist activity, Chinese aggression in the
**S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea,
[continued **Russian subversion in Ukraine** and elsewhere,
and]{.underline} in various terrorist activities [in **Africa** and the
**Middle East**]{.underline}. Those conflicts have not been prevented
even by conventional capabilities, let alone U.S. nuclear deterrent
forces. Nevertheless, [is the prudent response to jettison a significant
portion of U.S. nuclear capability?]{.underline}

[The new post-Cold War era still requires the prevention of any number
of possible crises from **escalating** into **armed conflict** between
any of the nine **nuclear-armed** nations. The era also requires
stopping **existing** conflicts from becoming **wholesale nuclear
wars**]{.underline}.

[It is]{.underline} always [important to avoid]{.underline} what Israeli
missile defense expert Uzi Rubin calls [**\"fortune cookie analysis\"**
\-- the claim that the need for nuclear deterrence is over because \"it
didn\'t stop 9-11\" or today\'s conflicts]{.underline}.\[6\]

Terrorist attacks, such as 9-11, were also not prevented by non-nuclear
capabilities such as the FBI, Coast Guard, Border Patrol, the military,
or intelligence agencies. But the U.S. nuclear deterrent is not there
just for today. Any future deterrent needs to be robust and flexible
enough to anticipate technological surprise. There can also be sudden
changes in regimes and regimes\' intentions; these must also be taken
into account.

In addition, emerging technological threats such as cyber-attacks, the
advanced capabilities of long-range conventional strikes, and the threat
of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attacks are changing the pattern of
deterrence among various countries, according to Andrew Krepinevich,
president of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments
(CSBA).\[7\] Even so, as he underscores the need for new deterrent
capabilities, he does not minimize the need for a continued powerful
nuclear deterrent.

It is not enough to claim that a much smaller, even minimalist, nuclear
deterrent, will suffice for today. \"Less\" does not automatically mean
\"better.\" Nor is it enough simply to add up what other countries spend
on defense, compare it to what the United States spends, and declare
that the two sides need only be relatively equal in defense expenditure
for deterrence to be effective.

Deterrence is not about guaranteeing to your adversaries that you will
only spend what the adversary deems acceptable to enable a \"fair
fight.\" It is important to spend whatever is needed to ensure a
credible, capable force. It would be reckless to adopt some arbitrary
figure based on what others might spend, or unilaterally to accept
sentimental notions about what is \"fair.\"

Unfortunately, there have been a number of recent calls for the U.S. to
reduce its nuclear arsenal unilaterally by 85% and to keep no more than
250 nuclear warheads. This low number would roughly equal the warheads
fielded by Pakistan and India combined.

What is the basis for such a proposal? Apparently such advocates start
with the assumption that a U.S. president will be deterred from taking
military action if, in a conflict, upward of 250 enemy warheads were
targeted in retaliation on American cities. [This logic
assumes]{.underline} that one\'s enemies think the same way as oneself,
and consequently, [that a small]{.underline} American
[arsenal]{.underline} of 250 nuclear warheads [would suffice to deter
would-be adversaries]{.underline}.

But do adversaries really think this way? Ironically, even the advocates
of such a minimal nuclear deterrent do not appear to believe their own
rhetorical assumptions. Most of the advocates of [a minimal nuclear
deterrent]{.underline} claim that 400 Minuteman silo-based missiles,
spread out over tens of thousands of square miles in five U.S. western
states, [would be vulnerable to attack]{.underline} by the same enemies
who are supposedly interested in attacking only cities. Why would Russia
or China target U.S. missile silos and other military assets when
presumably all they would need to do to maintain deterrence against the
U.S. is hold a few dozen American cities for ransom?

If one is to believe the advocates of minimum deterrence, Russia has
plans to attack 400 U.S. missile silos and nearly 50 associated launch
control centers. This assault would require Russia to maintain at least
900 warheads, attacking each American ICBM with at least two warheads to
ensure a high chance of destroying all of those targets.

But a Russia that had at least 900 warheads would not be balanced by the
United States that had only 250.

Deterrence simply does not work the way advocates of minimum deterrent
assert.

When a U.S. president orders military commanders to provide deterrence
against the country\'s enemies, this strategy must be measured against
what it takes to implement deterrence, and not against a nice round
number of nuclear warheads that appears \"reasonable.\"

Further, is a U.S. president comfortable with only the option of
striking back at an adversary\'s cities? Would threatening to incinerate
millions even be a moral or workable deterrent strategy? With 250
warheads in total, and perhaps just half of them available for
retaliation, [the only targets a U.S. president could sufficiently
threaten would be an adversary\'s cities, but not]{.underline} an
adversary\'s **[military assets]{.underline}** \-- not to mention if
other countries were to pile on, such as Russia, China, North Korea and
Iran.

The [minimalists argue that destroying]{.underline} a nation\'s [cities
would certainly deter any]{.underline} sane national [leader.
Yet]{.underline}, as Keith Payne, president of the National Institute of
Public Policy, explains, [many nations have not been deterred from
aggression, even by the prospect of losing millions of their own
citizens]{.underline}.\[8\] [In efforts to achieve their political
objectives, the Soviet Union, Iran, Cambodia, China and North Korea, to
mention the most obvious, have slaughtered tens of millions of their own
people]{.underline}. In communist nations alone, the number exceeds 95
million.\[9\] Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan killed and maimed millions
of their own people by going to war and continuing the conflict even
when their defeat was clearly imminent.

Would the U.S. seek to deter ISIS and Hezbollah this way? Or Iran or
North Korea, for that matter?

The weapons or [military assets]{.underline} of one\'s adversaries \--
the weapons one would need to hold at risk or target \-- [are precisely
the instruments of state power on which these enemies rely for their
status as global or regional powers and prestige. Holding such assets at
risk gives the U.S. president the **ultimate \"stick\"**]{.underline}
with which to threaten to take away the adversary\'s power: his military
assets.

Today, non-state terrorist organizations also have such assets, as seen
from fighting ISIS, Al Qaeda, Hamas Hezbollah, the FMLN and FARC.

Thus, holding at risk, or being able to destroy a significant number of,
say, Russian submarines, missile silos, bomber bases, and other
instruments of military power, thereby leaving Russia unable to act as a
major power, is not an attempt to \"go first\" in a crisis or \"get the
jump\" on one\'s enemies. Instead, it merely places at risk all the
instruments of state power \-- consisting of hundreds of militarily
critical targets \-- upon which, for instance, a Russian or Chinese head
of state relies for world power status.

This plan requires a nuclear deterrent capable of striking back at an
enemy with sufficient surviving nuclear warheads, even after absorbing
an enemy\'s initial strike against one\'s own military assets.

A deterrent strategy such as the U.S. has today leaves nuclear-armed
adversaries with only one sound choice in a crisis. Either they risk
\"Armageddon\" and use all their nuclear weapons early in a crisis, to
avoid seeing any of their military assets destroyed by the U.S. in a
subsequent retaliatory strike; or they stand down, not launching their
nuclear weaponry, and instead seek to end any crisis through
diplomatically. This is the essence of deterrence. It is one that the
late American diplomat Paul Nitze described as the \"Not Today,
Comrade\" option.\[10\] Today it would be, \"Not Today, Jihadi.\"

Such a deterrent strategy, as advocated here and reflected in America\'s
current nuclear modernization plans, stands the test of logic. If an
adversary used all its nuclear forces against the U.S. in a first
strike, such an attack would invite a massive retaliatory strike from
the U.S. that would leave an attacker completely destroyed.

But [that]{.underline}, of course, [requires a survivable U.S. deterrent
force to begin with; not one subject to being eliminated by an enemy\'s
first strike because the U.S. deterrent was **so small** that it was
**no deterrent at all**]{.underline}.

According to the Obama administration, to guarantee maximum flexibility
in a crisis so that a president can be confident he has a survivable
deterrent, a robust deployment of 1550 warheads is required, on a
mixture of 12 submarines, 400 ICBMs and 40-60 bombers. Fortunately, this
is the number the U.S. can field under the 2010 New Start Treaty with
Russia.

Having a nuclear deterrent strategically dispersed among over 500
nuclear assets \-- submarines, land-based missiles, and bombers \--
means that any enemy attempt to destroy the U.S. nuclear arsenal before
the U.S. could use it, would require an unambiguous attack. If an
adversary, such as Russia, were to deploy its entire arsenal against the
United States, the attack would involve over fifteen hundred warheads.

The U.S. would know from where most of the warheads would be coming:
ICBMs flying over the North Pole could easily be seen by U.S.
early-warning satellites.

U.S. allies also would see preparations, such as weapons platforms
moved, for such a strike. Enemy forces would have to be moved from a
day-to-day alert status to heightened alert if there were plans to
destroy U.S. nuclear forces in their entirety. That is why the U.S. has,
and is planning to keep, more than 500 nuclear assets, including
submarines, bombers, and silo-based missiles capable of surviving even
the most massive strike.

Deploying only 250 warheads, however \-- all of them on submarines, as
many minimal deterrent advocates have proposed \-- would make such a
secure retaliatory force impossible to maintain. It would also so
minimize the size of the U.S. deterrent forces \-- to fewer than 10
targets \-- as possibly to invite an attack.

By contrast, a flexible U.S. nuclear deterrent policy, based on keeping
a large deployment of day-to-day survivable forces \-- numbering over
500 missiles, submarines and bombers \-- leaves the president options.
There is no need to act rashly. An enemy could then be informed that any
attack, no matter how large, would invite such a massive retaliation
that no benefit whatsoever would accrue to the attacker. Such a force
also would allow the president, during a crisis, to make the U.S.
deterrent even more survivable over time, by putting more U.S.
submarines to sea and placing U.S. bombers on alert or in the air.

Such [a new nuclear force of submarines, bombers and ICBMs, which **the
U.S. is now beginning to produce**]{.underline} (albeit after much
delay), [would allow the U.S. to threaten the **entire range** of an
adversary\'s military assets, and not be limited only to striking back
at an enemy\'s cities]{.underline}. These twin capabilities \-- having a
survivable force day-to-day and an even more highly survivable force
over time \-- would avoid putting all one\'s nuclear eggs in one
minimalist leaky basket.

[The U.S. nuclear \"Triad\"]{.underline} consists [of]{.underline}
nuclear [warheads]{.underline} mounted on platforms based [at sea, in
the air and on land]{.underline}.

The strategy [is called **\"crisis stability\"**: giving no nuclear
power the incentive to strike first, and providing **the world** with
the **stability** it needs to **avoid Armageddon**]{.underline}.

[For **70 years**, this strategy has **kept the nuclear peace**. This
strategy even allowed the U.S. and]{.underline} the USSR, (subsequently
[Russia) carefully and logically to reduce the number of]{.underline}
strategic, long-range nuclear [weapons by nearly 90%, while maintaining
strategic stability]{.underline}.

[In short, **nuclear deterrence still matters**]{.underline}. If the
U.S. deterrent is even more survivable, flexible, and robust, while
maintained at lower levels than during the Cold War, such
[modernization]{.underline} as the U.S. is now planning
[provides]{.underline} America\'s [leaders with the **leverage** in a
**crisis** to keep a **major armed conflict** from breaking
out]{.underline}. And it keeps the United States and its allies safe.

Unlike spies, most of whom are eventually caught; leakers of classified
information are infrequently identified. The dramatic cases of Snowden
(who identified himself) and Manning are notable exceptions. [**[Most
leakers]{.underline}** [remain]{.underline}
**[hidden]{.underline}**]{.mark}[, and [only a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[handful]{.underline}**]{.mark} [have ever been

**[dismal]{.underline}**. During the four-year period 2009-2013,
intelligence agencies filed 153 crimes reports about classified leaks to
the press with the Department of Justice. But only 24 were investigated;
only half of these were identified, and not a single indictment was
issued.27 The scorecard reads: Leakers 153; Intelligence Community 0. In
general, our legal system is ill equipped to deal with leakers.28 And
the culture that strongly supports First Amendment press freedoms often
seems conflicted about whether leakers are really law-breakers and is
skeptical that press leaks of intelligence actually do much damage.
Perhaps [the **great**est **damage**]{.underline} to national security
from press leaks, as with espionage, [is **opportunity costs**: The
**intel**ligence that will never be collected or used for the nation's
decision advantage because of the damage to or even the loss of
classified collection sources and methods compromised by press
leaks]{.underline}.

Conclusions

Importantly, American spies and government employees who leak classified
information to the press have recently become a national priority for a
concerted program to counter the threats they pose to national security.
On November 21, 2012, the White House issued a Presidential Memorandum
establishing [a new]{.underline} **[Insider Threat
Program]{.underline}**. It aims to deter, detect, and mitigate such
actions by government employees as espionage and unauthorized
disclosures of classified information, including "vast amounts of
classified data available on interconnected United States Government
computer networks and systems."29 While a notably important initiative,
it [falls]{.underline} **[dramatically short]{.underline}** of the
comprehensive steps really needed.

it -- is long overdue.

WHAT MAY GO WRONG

As already noted, [a fashionable rejoinder]{.underline} to such
broodings [is to insist that all]{.underline} of these [states will be
mutually deterred. Any intelligent state, it is argued, should know that
using nuclear weapons is militarily self-defeating and that these
weapons' only legitimate mission is to deter]{.underline} military
threats. [According to this view, fretting about nuclear use and
proliferation is mistaken or overwrought.]{.underline}18

**[But is it?]{.underline}** **[Can]{.underline}** [states deter
military threats with **nuc**lear weapon**s** if their]{.underline}
**[actual use]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} **[universally
viewed]{.underline}** [as]{.underline} being
**[self-defeating?]{.underline}** [Which nuclear-armed states, if
any,]{.underline} **[actually believe]{.underline}** [they
are]{.underline} **[militarily useless?]{.underline}** As noted earlier,
[the]{.underline} [**[Russia]{.mark}**ns and]{.underline}
[**[Pakistan]{.mark}**is clearly do not. Just the]{.underline}
[**opposite**, they have gone]{.underline} **[out of their
way]{.underline}** [to develop]{.underline} **[battlefield
nuc]{.underline}**lear weapon**[s]{.underline}** and plan to use them
first to deter and defeat opposing advanced conventional forces. As for
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates,
[**France**, and]{.underline} the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[K]{.underline}**ingdom, [all have]{.underline} [**studiously
refuse**d to renounce first use]{.underline}. Israel, meanwhile, insists
that, while it will not be first to introduce nuclear weapons in the
Middle East, it will not be second. This leaves North Korea---a wild
card---and India and China, whose declared no first use policies are
either unclear or under reconsideration.19

[However, are the days of highly destructive wars--- nuclear or
nonnuclear---not behind us?]{.underline} Certainly, with the events
surrounding September 11, 2001 (9/11), this view has gained increasing
support from a number of U.S. and allied military analysts and
pundits.20 Reflecting this outlook, the United States and its European
allies have turned several Cold War nuclear "survival" bunkers into
private real estate offerings or historical tourist sites.21

[The problem is that]{.underline} at least two states have not done so.
U.S. intelligence agencies have determined that **[Russia]{.underline}**
invested over US\$6 billion to expand a 400-square-mile underground
nuclear complex at Yamantau, a full decade after the fall of the Berlin
Wall. This complex is burrowed deep enough to withstand a nuclear
attack, [and]{.underline} is large enough and provisioned sufficiently
to house 60,000 people for months. U.S. intelligence officials believe
it is one of a system of as many as 200 Russian nuclear bunkers (see
figure 3-7).22

\[\[FIGURE 3.7 OMITTED\]\]

[**[China]{.mark}**'s nuclear passive defense is]{.underline} no less
**[impressive]{.underline}**. In 2009, China's strategic missile
command, the 2nd Artillery Brigade, revealed that it had completed 3,000
miles of dispersed, deep, underground tunnels for the deployment of its
nuclear-capable cruise and ballistic missile forces. China spent
enormous sums to build this system and is still expanding the complex,
known as the Underground Great Wall. The system is said to be
**[designed]{.underline}** and provisioned [to **house
thousands**]{.underline} of military staff [during a]{.underline}
**[nuclear exchange]{.underline}** (see figure 3-8).24

\[\[FIGURE 3.8 OMITTED\]\]

GOING BALLISTIC

All of [this suggests]{.underline} that several [nuclear-armed states
**still [believe]{.mark}** [they may]{.mark} have to **endure** or
**[engage in nuclear exchanges]{.mark}**. **Fortifying**]{.underline}
[this suspicion is the increasing capacity states have to deliver both
nuclear and nonnuclear payloads quickly against one
another]{.underline}. Back in 1962, only the United States and Russia
had nuclear-capable missile systems---i.e., cruise or ballistic missile
systems capable of delivering a first-generation nuclear warhead
(weighing 500 kilograms) 300 kilometers or farther.26 Now, no fewer than
24 countries have perfected or acquired such systems, and nine can
launch a satellite into orbit---i.e., have mastered all that is needed
to deploy an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). In addition, the
United States, China, Iran, South Korea, Israel, and key NATO states are
all working on precision conventional missiles capable of knocking out
large military bases and major naval surface combatants that, only a few
decades ago, were difficult or impossible to destroy without using
nuclear weapons.27 More nuclear-capable missile states are likely to
emerge (see figure 3-9).

\[\[FIGURE 3.9 OMITTED\]\]

[The]{.underline} **[strategic uncertainties]{.underline}** [these
missile trends can generate are]{.underline} **[difficult to
exaggerate]{.underline}**. First, the
**[[prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration [[of]{.mark} **long-range
[missiles]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[allows]{.mark} many [more countries
to play in any]{.mark} given **[regional dispute]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
One way to measure a state's diplomatic potential to influence others
militarily is simply to map out the range arcs of its deployed missiles.
Today, increasingly, these arcs and the diplomatic-political "power"
shadows they cast overlap. Consider **[Iran]{.underline}**: its missiles
now target Israel, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE),
**[Russia]{.underline}**, Pakistan, France, Saudi Arabia,
**[China]{.underline}**, and [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[K]{.underline}**ingdom.

This is a very different world than that of a half-century ago. In 1962,
when alliance loyalties within the Communist and Free World Blocs were
at their height, only Russia and America had missiles aimed at each
other. Now, there is no Communist Bloc, what remains of the Free World
alliance system (e.g., NATO; Australia, New Zealand, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates Security Treaty
\[ANZUS\]; etc.) is relatively weak, and nuclear-capable missiles in
hotspots like the Persian Gulf could be fired from any number of
states---both near and far. For nuclear-armed states, this situation
places a premium on protecting their nuclear weapons-related systems
against surprise attack.29 It also raises first-order questions about
nuclear escalation, which brings us to the second reason more missiles
in more hands is a major worry: these **[missiles]{.underline}** also
[can [act as]{.mark}]{.underline} **[conventional
[catalysts]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[for]{.underline} **[nuclear
wars]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

Increasingly, with precision guidance and advanced munitions
technologies, it is possible to destroy targets that once required
nuclear weapons---e.g., large air strips and air fields, command
centers, naval ports, and even large, moving surface ships---with a
handful of precise, conventionally-armed missiles instead. This has
raised the prospect of states being able to knock out a significant
portion of an opponent's key military forces without having to use
nuclear weapons.30

The good news is that this should make the initial use of nuclear
weapons less likely. The bad news is that [with enough precision
guidance capabilities, [a state might]{.mark} be tempted to]{.underline}
[**[initiate combat]{.underline}** [in the **expectation**]{.underline}
[of winning without]{.underline}]{.mark} [ever [having to go nuclear
and]{.mark} end up]{.underline} [**[miscalculating]{.mark}**
badly]{.underline}.

WAR SCENARIOS

A real-world case, much discussed by Pakistani security analysts, is the
mid-term prospect of an Indian conventional missile decapitation of
Pakistani nuclear strategic command and control centers. The Indians, in
this scenario, would use precise, offensive, longrange missiles to
destroy these centers. Then, New Delhi could deter any remaining
Pakistani retaliatory nuclear strike with India's much larger nuclear
forces and with Indian nonnuclear missile defenses. Finally, India could
prevail against Pakistani armor and artillery, with superior Indian
military conventional forces.

To hedge against this prospect, Pakistan ramped up its nuclear arms
production and is deploying its nuclear weapons in ways designed to
complicate Indian efforts to destroy them (e.g., delegation of launch
authority under certain circumstances, forward deployment, dispersal,
mobility, etc.). All of these methods only increase the prospects for
nuclear use and have goaded India to develop new nuclear options of its
own.

[Beyond this, advanced conventional weapons [might
ignite]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[nuclear conflict]{.mark}
directly]{.underline}. Again, consider India and Pakistan. After being
targeted by so many Pakistani-backed terrorist attacks, the Indian
Government has developed a conventional counterstrategy known as "Cold
Start." Under this approach, India would respond to Pakistan-backed
terrorist attacks by quickly seizing a limited amount of Pakistani
territory with quick alert, forward deployed Indian forces (i.e., that
could launch from what Indian military planners call a "cold start").
The idea here would be to threaten to take a limited amount of territory
that Pakistan holds dear, but not enough to prompt Pakistan to attack
India with its nuclear weapons.

Unfortunately, India's adoption of its Cold Start plan has had nearly
the reverse effect. Shortly after New Delhi broached this strategy,
Pakistani military officials announced their intent to use tactical
nuclear weapons against any invading Indian force and deployed new,
short-range nuclear-capable tactical missiles along the Pakistani-Indian
border precisely for this purpose. India has responded by deploying
tactical missiles of its own. It is unclear just how serious either
India or Pakistan are about carrying out these war plans, but this
uncertainty is itself a worry.31

Of course, relying on nuclear weapons to counter conventional threats is
not unique to Pakistan. Moscow, faced with advanced Chinese and NATO
conventional forces, has also chosen to increase its reliance on
tactical nuclear weapons. For Russia, employing these weapons is far
less stressful economically than trying to field advanced conventional
forces and is militarily pragmatic, given Russia's shrinking cohort of
eligible military servicemen. China, in response, may be toying with
deploying additional tactical nuclear systems of its own.32

CHINA AND THE NUCLEAR RIVALRIES AHEAD

All of these trends are challenging. They also suggest what the next
strategic arms competition might look like. First, if the United States
and Russia maintain or reduce their current level of nuclear weapons
deployments, it is possible that at least one other nuclear weapons
state may be tempted to close the gap. Of course, in the short- and even
mid-term, Pakistan, Israel, and India could not hope to catch up. For
these states, getting ahead of the two superpowers would take great
effort and at least one to three decades of continuous, flat-out
military nuclear production. It is quite clear, moreover, that none of
these states have set out to meet or beat the United States or Russia as
a national goal.

China, however, is a different matter. It clearly sees the United States
as a key military competitor in the Western Pacific and in Northeast
Asia. China also has had border disputes with India and historically has
been at odds with Russia as well. It is not surprising, then, that China
has actively been modernizing its nuclear-capable missiles to target key
U.S. and Indian military air and sea bases with advanced conventional
missiles, and is developing missiles that are even more advanced to
threaten U.S. carrier task forces on the open seas. In support of such
operations, China is also modernizing its military space assets, which
include military communications, command, surveillance, and imagery
satellites and an emerging antisatellite capability.33

Then there is China's nuclear arsenal. For nearly 30 years, most
respected Western security analysts have estimated the number of
deployed Chinese nuclear warheads to be between 190 and 300.34 Yet, by
any account, China has produced enough weapons-usable plutonium and
uranium to make up to four times this number of weapons. Why, then, have
Chinese nuclear deployments been judged to be so low?

First, China has experienced first-hand what might happen if its nuclear
weapons fell into the wrong hands. During the Cultural Revolution, one
of its nuclear weapons laboratories test fired a nuclear-armed
medium-range missile over heavily populated regions of China and
exploded the device. Not long after, Mao Zedong ordered a major
consolidation of China's nuclear warheads and had them placed under much
tighter centralized control. Arguably, the fewer nuclear warheads China
has, the easier it is for its officials to maintain control over them.35

Second, and possibly related, is China's declared nuclear weapons
strategy. In all of its official military white papers since 2006 and in
other forums, Chinese officials insist that Beijing would never be first
to use nuclear weapons and would never use them against any nonnuclear
weapons state. China also supports a doctrine that calls for a nuclear
retaliatory response that is no more than what is "minimally" required
for its defense. Most Western Chinese security experts have interpreted
these statements to mean that Beijing is interested in holding only a
handful of opponents' cities at risk. This, in turn, has encouraged
Western officials to settle uncertainties regarding Chinese nuclear
warhead numbers toward the low end.36

What China's actual nuclear use policies might be, though, is open to
debate. As one analyst quipped, with America's first use of nuclear
weapons against Japan in 1945, it is literally impossible for any
country other than the United States to be first in using these weapons.
More important, Chinese officials have emphasized that Taiwan is not an
independent state and that under certain circumstances, it may be
necessary for China to use nuclear weapons against this island
"province." In addition, there are the notso-veiled nuclear threats that
senior Chinese generals have made against the United States if it should
use conventional weapons against China in response to a Chinese attack
against Taiwan (including the observation that the United States would
not be willing to risk Los Angeles to save Taipei).37

Finally, as China deploys more land-mobile and submarine-based nuclear
missile systems, there will be increased technical and bureaucratic
pressures to delegate more launch authority to each of China's military
services. China's ballistic missile submarines already have complete
nuclear systems under the command of their respective submarine
captains. As China deploys ever more advanced road-mobile nuclear
missiles, their commanders may want to have similar authority.
Historically, in the United States and Russia, such delegation of launch
authority came with increased nuclear weapons requirements.38

The second cause for conservatism in assessing China's arsenal is the
extent to which estimates of the number of Chinese warheads have been
tied to the observed number of Chinese nuclear weapons missile
launchers. So far, the number of these launchers that have been seen has
been relatively low. Moreover, few, if any, missile reloads are assumed
for each of these missile launchers and it is presumed only a handful of
China's missiles have multiple warheads. The numbers of battlefield
nuclear weapons, such as nuclear artillery, are also presumed to be low
or nonexistent.

All of this may be right, but there are reasons to wonder. The Chinese,
after all, claim that they have built 3,000 miles of tunnels to hide
China's nuclear-capable missile forces and related warheads and that
China continues to build such tunnels. Employing missile reloads for
mobile missile systems has been standard practice for Russia and the
United States. It would be odd if it were not also a Chinese practice,
particularly given China's growing number of land-mobile solid-fueled
rocket and cruise missile systems. With China's recent development of
the DF-41, a massive, mobile, nuclear-armed ICBM, and its deployment of
multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs) on its
silo-based DF-5s, U.S. authorities believe China is deploying a new
generation of MIRV missiles.39 As already noted, several experts believe
China may be considering battlefield artillery for the delivery of
tactical nuclear shells.

Precisely how large is China's nuclear arsenal, then? The answer is
unclear. The Chinese say they are increasing the size of their nuclear
weapons arsenal "appropriately."40 They have not yet said by how much.
General Viktor Yesin, the former chief of Russia's strategic rocket
forces, told U.S. security experts in 2012 that China may have more than
900 deployed nuclear weapons and another 900 nuclear weapons stored in
reserve.41 This estimate, which is roughly seven times greater than most
analysts believe Beijing possesses, would give China roughly as many
warheads as the United States currently has deployed.42 Putting aside
how accurate this Russian projection might be, the first problem it and
other larger estimates present is how sound long-term U.S. and Russian
strategic plans might be. It hardly is in Washington's or Moscow's
interest to let Beijing believe it could threaten Taiwanese, Japanese,
American, Indian, or Russian targets conventionally because China's
nuclear forces were so large Beijing could assume they would deter any
of these states from ever responding militarily (see figure 3-10).

\[\[FIGURE 3.10 OMITTED\]\]

Yet another question that a much larger Chinese nuclear strategic force
would raise is how it might affect future U.S.-Russian strategic arms
negotiations. As China has increased its deployments of highly precise,
nuclear-capable missile systems, Moscow has chaffed at the missile
limits that the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty imposes
on its fielding similar systems. Since the conclusion of New START in
2011, Moscow has balked at making any further cuts unless China is
included in the negotiations. Shortly after several U.S. security
analysts and Members of Congress spotlighted Russian moves to break out
of the INF Treaty,44 the State Department announced that Russia, in
fact, had violated the treaty.45 American hawks, meanwhile, have warned
against the United States making further nuclear cuts lest other states,
like China, quickly ramp up their force levels to meet or exceed ours.
Yet, U.S. President Donald Trump has voiced a desire to do so.46 All of
this suggests the imperative for Washington and Moscow to factor China
into their arms control and strategic modernization calculations. The
question is how.

OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES

Unfortunately, getting a sound answer to this question is not possible
without first considering the security concerns of states other than the
United States, Russia, and China. **[Japan]{.underline}**, for one,
[is]{.underline} an [interested]{.underline} party. It already has
roughly 2,000 weapons' worth of separated plutonium on its soil. This
plutonium was supposed to fuel Japan's light water and fast reactors, a
fleet that, before the accident at Fukushima, consisted of 54 reactors.
After the accident, Japan shut down all of these plants, decided to
reduce its reliance on nuclear power as much as possible, and is
projected in the mid-term to bring no more than one-third of its light
water reactor fleet back online.47 Meanwhile, Japan's fast reactor
program has been effectively frozen since the 1990s due to a series of
accidents. Japan, the United States, and France plan on cooperating on a
renewed effort, but it is unlikely that a new fast reactor will be
operating in Japan for decades.48

A related and immediate operational question is whether Japan will bring
a US\$20-billion-plus commercial nuclear spent-fuel reprocessing plant
capable of producing roughly 1,500 bombs' worth of plutonium a year at
Rokkasho online sometime in the spring of 2021. This plutonium recycling
effort has been controversial. The original decision to proceed with it
was made by former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and can be tied to
Japanese considerations of developing a plutonium nuclear weapons
option. Although this plant is not necessary for the management of
Japan's spent fuel, the forward costs of operating it could run as high
as US\$100 billion. It is expected to produce 8 tons of weapons-usable
plutonium annually---enough to produce nearly as many first-generation
nuclear weapons as is contained in America's entire deployed nuclear
force (see figure 3-11).49

\[\[FIGURE 3.11 OMITTED\]\]

In light of the questionable technical and economic benefits of
operating Rokkasho, it would be difficult for Tokyo to justify
proceeding with this plant's operation unless it wanted to develop an
option to build a large nuclear weapons arsenal.51 Given Japan currently
retains nearly 11 tons of mostly reactor-grade plutonium on its soil,
enough to make roughly 2,000 first-generation nuclear warheads, there is
no immediate need to bring Rokkasho online to assure a military nuclear
option.

However, Japan says it is committed to eliminating this surplus
plutonium stockpile and recently surrendered roughly 800 kilograms of
weapons-grade plutonium and uranium to the United States in pursuance of
this stated goal.52 In this context, keeping Rokkasho on the ready could
be seen as a national security insurance policy. Some leading Japanese
figures clearly see it in this light,53 and technically, there is little
question that the plutonium could be used to make effective weapons.54
In this regard, even under a much less nationalistic, pro-nuclear
government than the one now in office, Japan's National Diet in the fall
of 2012 felt compelled to clarify in law that the purpose of the
country's atomic energy program included supporting Japan's "national
security."55 Many nuclear observers outside of Japan saw this as a
not-so-veiled reference to Japan's "civilian" plutonium-fuel cycle
program.

Certainly, South Korean and Chinese officials and commentators
spotlighted this prospect with concern.56 Their apprehensions, then,
raise the questions: What might happen if Japan ever decided to open
Rokkasho? How could this avoid stoking South Korean ambitions to make
their own nuclear fuels? What of China's longterm efforts to modernize
its own nuclear weapons systems and its "peaceful" scheme of building a
copy of Rokkasho itself? Would starting up Rokkasho not catalyze these
efforts? What if Japan's [startup]{.underline} of Rokkasho came after
some Chinese or North Korean military provocation? [Might]{.underline}
this not [trigger **a**]{.underline}n additional [round of]{.underline}
[[**Chinese**, **No**]{.mark}rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rean, [and
**So**]{.mark}uth]{.underline} [**[Ko]{.mark}**rean]{.underline}
military and **[[nuclear hedging]{.underline}]{.mark}** actions?57

Yet another "peaceful" East Asian nuclear activity that bears watching
is the substantial plans both Japan and China have to enrich uranium.
Both countries justify these efforts as being necessary to fuel their
light water reactor fleets. There are several difficulties with this
argument, though. First, both countries already have access to foreign
uranium enrichment services that are more than sufficient to supply
current demand. Second, any effort to become commercially
self-sufficient in enriching uranium in the name of "energy
independence" is questionable for Japan and China, given their lack of
economic, domestic sources of highgrade uranium ore.

Even assuming China could stop importing enrichment services, as it now
does from URENCO of Europe and Minatom/Tenex of Russia, then it still
would want to import much of its uranium ore from overseas. Of course,
operating a commercial enrichment capacity could afford a bargaining
advantage to secure cheaper foreign enrichment service contracts. In
China's case (and Japan's and South Korea's cases as well), such
advantage can be had at enrichment capacities far below those they have
or want to acquire. Again, both uranium ore and enrichment services are
readily available globally at reasonable prices and are projected to
remain so. Uranium yellowcake spot prices are currently at historic
lows. As for enrichment services, the world's current surplus of
enrichment capacity is projected to persist at least through 2035.58 In
short, there is no lack of enrichment services internationally and,
given China's access to Russian and European enrichers, there is little
or no immediate economic imperative for building more.

China, however, sees things differently. It currently has enough
capacity to fuel a dozen large reactors and is building more than enough
centrifuges to fuel 58 gigawatts of nuclear capacity, optimistically
projected to be online by 2020.59 Some of this projected capacity may be
set aside for possible reactor exports beyond those China is making to
Pakistan. Yet, again given the foreign enrichment services glut, none of
this enrichment expansion makes economic sense. What is all too clear,
however, is just how much of a military option this enrichment capacity
affords. By 2020, China's planned enrichment capacity could fuel all of
its planned civilian reactors and still produce additional material
sufficient for more than 1,500 nuclear weapons a year.60

Japan's enrichment plans differ only in scale. Like China, it too lacks
economic, domestic sources of highgrade uranium ore. As for Tokyo's
current enrichment capacity, it can fuel about eight reactors a year. If
Japan used all of this enrichment capacity for military purposes, it
could make roughly 4,500 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium
annually---enough to make at least 200 first-generation nuclear
weapons.61 Japan plans to upgrade its uranium enrichment centrifuges.
The question, in light of the global surplus of commercial uranium
enrichment capacity, though, is why (see figure 3-12).

\[\[FIGURE 3.12 OMITTED\]\]

As noted, China or South Korea agree with none of these Japanese nuclear
fuel-making activities and plans. Seoul, in a not so well-disguised
security hedge, began to press Washington in 2009 for permission to
separate "peaceful" plutonium from U.S.-origin spent fuel and to enrich
U.S.-origin uranium in South Korea.

These requests coincided with several other South Korean
security-related demands. The first came after North Korea's sinking of
the Cheonan and the bombardment of Yeonpyeong Island. South Korean
Parliamentarians asked the United States to redeploy U.S. tactical
nuclear weapons on South Korean soil. Washington refused.63 Then Seoul
pushed Washington to extend the range of its nuclear-capable missiles
from 300 to 800 kilometers, and be practically freed from range limits
on its cruise missile and space satellite launchers. Washington
relented.64 As for South Korea's nuclear demands, Seoul is likely to
continue to press its case.65

The question is what is next? Will Japan start Rokkasho as planned in
2021? What commercial nuclear fuel making activities, if any, might
Washington allow South Korea and China to engage in?66 Will North Korea
or China continue to engage in provocations that will increase Japanese
or South Korean demands for more strategic military independence from
their American security alliance partner?

The two popular rejoinders to these questions are that there is no
reason to worry. Most experts insist that neither Japan nor South Korea
would ever acquire nuclear weapons. The reasons, they argue, are simple.
It would not only undermine the nuclear nonproliferation regime that
they have sworn to uphold and strengthen, but it would also risk their
continued security ties with their most important ally, the United
States.

Perhaps; but [when]{.underline} **[So]{.underline}**uth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea [first doubted its American security guarantees
in the 1970s, **it tried**]{.underline} [to get nuclear
weapons]{.underline}.67 [Those doubts]{.underline} **[continue
today]{.underline}** as North Korea builds up its nuclear and nonnuclear
forces against the South.68 On May 29, 2014, South Korea's president
noted that, if North Korea tested another nuclear weapon, it would be
difficult "to prevent a nuclear domino from occurring in this area."
This would be a clear warning to not only North Korea, but also the
United States and China, that, if they fail to prevent Pyongyang from
further perfecting its nuclear force, Japan and South Korea might well
acquire nuclear weapons of their own.69 After Pyongyang conducted its
fourth nuclear test on January 6, 2016, South Korean and Japanese
politicians commented on the legality and desirability of developing
nuclear weapons options.70 They repeated these points when Pyongyang
tested its fifth device later in 2016.71

Yet another optimistic view argues that it may actually be in
Washington's interest to let Japan and South Korea go nuclear. Letting
them arm might actually tighten U.S. relations with these key allies,
while reducing what the United States would otherwise have to spend for
their protection. Implicit to this argument is the hope that neither
Seoul nor Tokyo would feel compelled to acquire many weapons---i.e.,
that like the United Kingdom, they would eagerly integrate their modest
nuclear forces with that of America's larger force, share their target
lists with Washington, and that Washington would do likewise with them
(as Washington already has with London).72

Again, this is plausible. However, it is worth noting that Japan and
South Korea are not the United Kingdom. Early on, the United Kingdom
understood its nuclear weapons efforts would ultimately be subordinate
to and in the service of maintaining its "special relationship" with
Washington (and scaled down its nuclear efforts accordingly). With the
Japanese and South Koreans, though, their nuclear efforts would
unavoidably be seen as a vote of no confidence in Washington's nuclear
security guarantees. As such, these efforts would have to deal with
demands by nationalists eager to build a truly independent nuclear force
of much more ambitious dimensions.73 More important (and more likely),
even if Japanese and South Korean officials wanted to keep their forces
subordinate to those of the United States, they might still be driven to
acquire larger nuclear forces of their own to deal with the likely
military reactions of China, North Korea, and other nuclear states.74

Consider the action-reaction dynamic that Seoul or Tokyo going nuclear
might set into motion with Beijing and Pyongyang. Presumably, in all
cases (**[China]{.underline}** included), each state [would try to
protect its strategic forces against possible attacks by building
more]{.underline} **[passive defenses]{.underline}** (hardening,
mobilizing, tunneling, etc.). They [also]{.underline} would [focus on
building up their]{.underline} **[offensive]{.underline}**
[forces]{.underline} (both nuclear and nonnuclear) so they might
eliminate as much of each other's strategic forces at sea and on land as
soon as any war began (this to limit the damage they would otherwise
suffer). [Finally, they would [increase the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[number]{.underline}** [of nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark} [weapons
[assets]{.mark}]{.underline}, missile portals, and other strategic aim
points to prevent any of their adversaries from thinking they could
"knock out" their retaliatory forces. [This]{.underline}, roughly, [is
what unfolded during the Cold War rivalry]{.underline} between
Washington and the Soviet Union. As was the case for Russia and the
United States then, maintaining one's relative nuclear position could
easily drive up East Asian nuclear weapons requirements well beyond
scores or even hundreds of weapons.75

Potentially catalyzing this rivalry further are the actions China's
immediate nuclear neighbors might take. As has already been noted,
[the]{.underline} **[Russians]{.underline}** [are unlikely to reduce
their nuclear weapons deployments if the Chinese increase
theirs]{.underline}. As for **[India]{.underline}**, it already has
roughly 100 nuclear weapons and many hundreds of bombs' worth of
separated reactor-grade plutonium it claims it can fashion into nuclear
weapons. It [is]{.underline} [hedging its nuclear bets]{.underline} even
further with plans to build six unsafeguarded plutonium-producing
breeder reactors by 2030 and an enrichment plant that may double its
production of weapons-grade uranium.76 Late in 2011, India announced it
was working with Russia to develop a terminally guided ICBM in response
to Chinese medium-range ballistic missile deployments near India's
borders.77

New Delhi has also pushed the development of a nuclear submarine force,
submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM), missile defenses,
long-range cruise missiles, and improved strategic command and control
and intelligence systems. India is not yet competing with China
weapon-for-weapon. However, if China were to increase its nuclear
weapons deployments significantly, Indian leaders might argue that they
had no other choice but to increase their own nuclear holdings.

This then brings us back to **[Pakistan]{.underline}**. It has done all
it can to keep up with India militarily. Since Islamabad is already
producing as much plutonium and highly enriched uranium as it can, it
would likely seek further technical assistance from China and financial
help from its close ally, Saudi Arabia. Islamabad may do this to hedge
against India, whether China or India build their nuclear arms up or
not. There is also good reason to believe that **[[Saudi]{.mark}
Arabia]{.underline}** [may]{.underline} want to cooperate on nuclear
weapons-related activities with Pakistan or China to help Saudi Arabia
[hedge against]{.underline} **[Iran]{.underline}**'s growing nuclear
weapons capabilities. It is unclear if either China or Pakistan would
actually transfer nuclear weapons directly to Saudi Arabia or choose
instead to help it merely develop aspects of a "peaceful" nuclear
program, including reprocessing and enrichment. They might do both.78

In this regard, Saudi Arabia has made it known that it intends to build
up its "peaceful" nuclear energy capabilities and will not forswear its
"right" to enrich uranium or to reprocess plutonium.79 This would
constitute one of the most lucrative, best financed near and mid-term
nuclear power markets in the world. The reactors Saudi Arabia might
build also could serve as the basis for development of a major nuclear
weapons option. As Saudi Arabia's former head of intelligence told NATO
ministers, the kingdom would have to get nuclear weapons if Iran did.80
Further underscoring this point, during a March 2018 visit to
Washington, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stated that if Iran
acquires a nuclear weapon, Saudi Arabia would do so as well "as soon as
possible."81

Saudi Arabia is not the only Muslim state to be pursuing a nuclear
future. **[[Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark}** [also announced an
ambitious]{.underline} "peaceful" [atomic]{.underline} power
[program]{.underline} shortly after Iran's nuclear enrichment efforts
were revealed in 2002, and expressed an interest in 2008 in enriching
its own uranium.82 Given Turkish qualms about Iran acquiring nuclear
weapons, the possibility of Ankara developing a nuclear weapons option
(as it previously toyed with doing in the late 1970s)83 must be taken
seriously. In addition, **[[Algeria]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[and]{.underline} **[[Egypt]{.underline}]{.mark}** (political rivals)
[[and]{.underline} **[Syria]{.underline}**]{.mark} (a historical ally of
Iran) [all have either attempted to develop nuclear weapons]{.underline}
options or refused to forswear making nuclear fuel, a process that can
bring them within weeks of acquiring a bomb. Algeria now has enough
plutonium and the skills to separate it from spent fuel to make several
bombs' worth.84 Egypt, which has long complained about Israeli nuclear
weapons and previously attempted to get nuclear weapons, has signed a
deal with Russia to construct its first large power reactor.85 Israel,
meanwhile, continues to make nuclear weapons materials at Dimona, and
all of these states have nuclear-capable missile systems (see figure
3-13).86

\[\[FIGURE 3-13 OMITTED\]\]

Very little of this rhymes with the world a halfcentury ago. In the
early 1960s, the only countries with civilian nuclear power reactors
were the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia. There are now 31
states. Most of these are in Eastern and Western Europe, but as figure
3-13 shows, other states in far less stable regions are hoping to bring
their first nuclear power plants online before 2035. This trend,
particularly in the Far and Middle East, has strategic implications.87

As already noted, each of these plants---even the most
proliferation-resistant light water reactor types--- can be regarded as
a "nuclear bomb starter kit." Although the nuclear industry has
consistently promoted the mistaken idea that the plutonium power
reactors produce is unsuitable to make bombs, these reactors can be
operated not only to produce large amounts of reactor-grade plutonium
that can be made into bombs, but also large amounts of weapons-grade and
near-weapons-grade plutonium as well.88 In fact, in their first 12-18
months of normal power production operation, these reactors can produce
roughly 50 bombs' worth of near-weapons-grade plutonium. If refueled
every 10 months, they can produce roughly 30 bombs' worth of
weapons-grade plutonium.89 The plants can and have been used as covers
to acquire weapons related technology, hardware, and training.90
Finally, the massive amounts of low-enriched fresh fuel stored at these
reactors for safety reasons can afford a source of low-enriched uranium
(LEU) to jumpstart a uranium enrichment weapons option.91 That is why
efforts are made to control the export of these plants and why they are
routinely inspected to guard against military diversions.92

As for declared nuclear fuel making plants---uranium hexafluoride and
enrichment facilities, plutonium separation and fuel fabrication plants,
etc.---a deeper problem occurs that relates to the limits of
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards themselves. Even
under ideal circumstances, the agency allows that, with commercial-sized
plants, it can lose track of special nuclear material. The margins of
statistical error associated with the inspection of these plants are
egregiously large. Consider the reprocessing plant Japan wants to
operate at Rokkasho. In this case, the agency can be expected to lose
track of roughly 250 kilograms (i.e., roughly 50 first-generation bombs'
worth) a year. This means that nearly 50 bombs' worth of weapons-usable
plutonium could possibly go missing from Rokkasho without setting off
any international inspection alarms at all.93

[Will the world be able to cope with the further [spread of]{.mark}
such]{.underline} "peaceful" [[nuclear facilities]{.mark}? Given

U.S. President Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} **[still
interested]{.underline}** [in negotiating]{.underline} **[more nuclear
constraints]{.underline}** with Russia.1 The United States has
encouraged all countries to protect civilian and military nuclear
facilities and stores of weapons-usable nuclear materials against theft
or sabotage. The United States has tried to persuade non-weapons states
to forgo civilian reprocessing or enrichment.

[These U.S. nuclear control initiatives, even if successful, **still
leave much to be done**]{.underline}. Several related areas cry out for
greater attention: nuclear and missile developments in China and East
Asia, the global spread of "peaceful" nuclear technology, and the
continued failure to develop a consistent, broad approach to preventing
nuclear proliferation. This suggests three recommendations.

RECOMMENDATION 1

Clarify China's strategic military capabilities and promote
nonproliferation and arms control measures that limit strategic weapons
in Asia. Most current nuclear arms control initiatives (e.g., the
Limited Test Ban Treaty \[LTBT\], the Comprehensive Nuclear-TestBan
Treaty \[CTBT\], the Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty \[FMCT\], limits on
missile defenses, Strategic Arms Limitation Talks \[SALT\], Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty \[START\], and Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
Treaty \[INF\]) were originally designed to limit arms competitions
between the United States and Russia. The Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty (NPT) was initially designed to reduce the prospects of nuclear
proliferation mostly in Europe. As the world's economic and strategic
center of gravity shifts toward Asia, though, it would make sense to
tailor more of our control efforts toward this region.

Wither Beijing?

This means, first, clarifying China's strategic capabilities. Beijing's
revelations that it has built 3,000 miles of deep tunnels to protect and
hide its dual-capable missiles and related nuclear warhead systems,
suggest the need to reassess estimates of China's nuclear-capable
missile and nuclear weapons holdings and plans. Are Beijing's
revelations disinformation designed to intimidate? Is it hiding more
military assets than we currently assess it has? What is it planning to
acquire and deploy? How much military fissile material---plutonium and
highly enriched uranium (HEU)---does China currently have on hand? How
likely is it that China has or will militarize or expand its fissile
material holdings? How might China militarize its civilian nuclear
infrastructure? How many different types of nuclear weapons does it have
or intend to deploy? How much fissile material does each type require?
How many missile reloads does China currently have; how many is it
planning to acquire? How extensive are Chinese deployments of multiple
warheads for the country's missiles, and how much further might China
expand these deployments? For which missile types and in what numbers?
How many nuclear and advanced conventional warheads is China deploying
on its missiles, bombers, submarines, and artillery? What are its plans
for using these forces? How might these plans relate to China's emerging
space, missile defense, and anti-satellite capabilities? All of these
questions, and more, deserve review within the U.S. Government, with
America's allies, and, to the extent possible, in cooperation with
India, Russia, as well as China itself.

As a part of this review, it also would be helpful to game alternative
war and military crisis scenarios that feature China's possible use of
these forces. These games should be conducted at senior political levels
in American and allied governments. Conducting such games should also
inform U.S. and allied arms control policies and military planning. With
regard to the latter, a key focus would have to be how one might defend,
deter, and limit the damage that Chinese nuclear and nonnuclear missile
systems might otherwise inflict against the United States, its bases in
the Western Pacific, America's friends and allies, and Russia.

This could entail not only the further development and deployment of
active missile defenses, but also of better passive defenses (e.g., base
hardening and improving the capacity to restore operations at bases
after attacks; hardened command, control, and communication systems;
etc.) and possibly new offensive forces---more capable, long-range
conventional strike systems to help neutralize possible offensive
Chinese operations.

Yet another focus for such gaming would be to clarify the likely
consequences of Japanese or South Korean acquisition of nuclear weapons.
These games should be held routinely, bilaterally, and multilaterally
with our allies and friends and, at times, with all of the key states,
including China, represented by informed experts and officials. The aim
of such games would not only be to understand just how risky Japanese
and South Korean nuclear proliferation might be, but to clarify the
risks China and North Korea will run if they continue to build up their
missile and nuclear forces.

Controlling Nuclear Missiles

Such gaming should also encourage a review of Washington's current arms
control agenda. Here several specific ideas, which are particularly
relevant to Asia, deserve attention. First among these is talks with
China, Russia, and other states about limiting groundbased, dual-capable
ballistic and cruise missiles. China possesses more of these systems
than any other state. Counting American, Russian, Indian, Pakistani,
North Korean, South Korean, and Chinese ground-based missiles, Asia is
targeted by more such missiles than any other region.

Unlike air- and sea-based missiles, groundlaunched systems can be
securely communicated with and fired instantly upon command. As such,
they are ideal for use in a first strike. These accurate, dual-capable
missiles also can inflict strategic harm against major bases and naval
operations when carrying conventional warheads.

Former U.S. President Ronald Reagan referred to these weapons as
"nuclear missiles," and looked forward to their eventual elimination.
Toward this end, he concluded the INF Treaty agreement, which eliminated
an entire class of ground-based nuclear-capable missiles, and negotiated
the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), which was designed to
block the further proliferation of nuclear-capable missiles (i.e.,
rockets and unmanned air-breathing systems capable of lifting over 500
kilograms for a distance of at least 300 kilometers). With the promotion
of space-based missile defenses, President Reagan hoped to eliminate
enough of such ground-based missiles to eliminate credible nuclear first
strike threats.2

Which states have an incentive to eliminate these missiles? The United
States eliminated all of its intermediate ground-launched missiles under
the INF Treaty. Most of America's shorter-range missiles are either
air-launched or below MTCR range-payload limits. As for U.S.
ground-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), they are all
based in fixed silos. To avoid being knocked out in any major future
nuclear exchange, these missiles may have to be launched on warning.
Russia, on the other hand, has a large, road-mobile ICBM force. At the
same time, it is worried about growing numbers of long-range, precision
missiles that both the United States and China are developing against
which it cannot easily defend.3

India and Pakistan have ground-launched ballistic missiles, but some of
their most seasoned military experts have called for the elimination of
short-range missiles, arguing that these weapons are only likely to
escalate border disputes.4 As for China, it has much to gain by
deploying more ground-launched missiles, unless, of course, such
deployment causes India, Russia, and the United States to react
militarily. The United States has been developing hypersonic boost glide
systems that could provide it with prompt global strike options. It
could base these systems either in the continental United States or in
forward bases in the Western Pacific.5 It also has hundreds of
silo-based ICBMs that it could convert to deliver advanced nonnuclear
payloads, including hypersonic boost glide systems.6 Provoking an
uncontrolled competition on the development of these weapons between the
United States, China, and Russia would not be in anyone's long-term
interest. Talks about reducing longrange, nuclear-capable ground-based
missile systems and preventing the further spread of advanced missile
technologies (e.g., hypersonic boost glide technology7 ) to other states
should be explored.8

Limiting Forward Nuclear Deployments

Another arms restriction that should be considered is keeping the
world's nuclear-armed states from deploying any additional nuclear
weapons in peacetime on the soil of states that lack such weapons. An
immediate concern is Saudi Arabia, rumored to be interested in buying
nuclear weapons either from China or Pakistan, or in getting either
nation to deploy several of their warheads there. Under the NPT, it is
permissible for nuclear weapons states to deploy their weapons in states
that lack such weapons so long as these weapons stay under the "control"
of the donor nuclear weapons state. This provision in the NPT was
crafted in the 1960s to allow the United States to continue to deploy
tactical nuclear weapons to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
countries and East Asia, and for the Soviet Union to do so in Warsaw
Pact countries.

Although the United States continues to forward base some of its weapons
in Europe, long-range bombers and missile systems have made it possible
to remove all of the forward deployed U.S. tactical nuclear systems from
East Asia. Given that Washington is unlikely to reintroduce them or to
increase existing deployments, it may be possible to broker some
understanding to forbid any further deployments in exchange for Chinese
and Pakistani pledges not to deploy any of their nuclear arms beyond
their soil.

With the turmoil in the Persian Gulf region, brokering such an
understanding would be timely. It also would have the immediate
advantage of engaging Pakistan, a non-NPT member, in some form of
nuclear arms restraint. This is something that should be encouraged more
generally with nuclear weapons-armed non-NPT members. Pakistan recently
announced its willingness to forgo nuclear testing unilaterally.9 Given
Pakistan's rivalry with India, perhaps New Delhi could be persuaded to
consider adopting such limits as well. Beyond this, other limits,
including on nuclear fissile production, might be sought by not only
Pakistan and India, but Israel as well. In this manner, one could begin
to view states that are now outside the NPT as being instead potential
NPT members in noncompliance---i.e., as states, which by taking steps
toward nuclear restraint, might improve their current noncompliant NPT
status. Additional nuclear restraints ought also to be promoted among
the nuclear weapons armed states. Although, there is no clear legally
binding obligation for the nuclear-armed states to disarm, the NPT
encourages all states to make good faith efforts to do so.10

Fissile Limits, Starting with China

If the United States could get other states to reduce their nuclear
weapons capabilities in a verifiable fashion, it should be open to
continuing to do so. Reaching new treaty agreements, though, ought not
to be the only measure of progress. Although it may not be possible to
conclude a fissile material cutoff treaty anytime soon, all of the other
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) should
press China to follow their lead in unilaterally forswearing making
fissile material for weapons. This, in turn, could be helpful in
pressing for moratoriums on "peaceful" nuclear fuel making of
uneconomical nuclear weapons-usable fuels as well.11

In this regard, an informal pause on the commercial production,
stockpiling, and recycling of plutonium would make sense. A good place
to begin would be in East Asia and the Pacific, starting with China, the
United States, Japan, and South Korea.12 Here, it is worth noting that
the 2012 report of the U.S. Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear
Future determined that dry cask storage would make more economic sense
for the United States to pursue in the management of waste and economic
production of nuclear electricity than commercial plutonium recycling in
the near and mid-term.13 Meanwhile, America's efforts to convert weapons
plutonium into commercial mixed oxide fuel (MOX) are likely to be
terminated.14 As for Japan's planned plutonium reprocessing and fast
reactor programs, Tokyo will have trouble implementing them given its
reduced reliance on nuclear power and its termination of its only
demonstration sized breeder at Monju. South Korea wants to recycle
plutonium in a prototype integrated fast reactor, but this program may
well get pushed back considerably. Its planned first fuel loading will
be low-enriched uranium (LEU), not plutonium-based fuel.15

China is working with AREVA to build a commercial reprocessing plant
nearly identical to the Rokkasho plant in Japan. A sticking point,
though, is siting. So far, Beijing has been unable to select a site its
public can accept. According to nuclear analysts, Beijing might build
this large commercial reprocessing plant by 2030, have it separate
plutonium for 10 to 20 years, and stockpile this material to fuel a
fleet of commercial breeder reactors.16 This view, in turn, is driven by
the expectation that uranium yellowcake will be unavailable after 2050
for anything less than US\$130 (current) per pound (i.e., 300 percent
more than the price today).17

This uranium price projection is speculative and rebuttable. What is not
is the potential military utility of China's civilian plutonium program.
As already noted, the commercial-sized reprocessing plant the Chinese
nuclear establishment may decide to build could produce enough plutonium
for roughly 1,500 first-generation bombs annually. Assuming China's
first breeder reactor came online by 2040, its first fueling with
plutonium would come only after China had amassed well over 15,000
weapons' worth of plutonium.

Of course, if any of the three East Asian states begins to reprocess
plutonium commercially, the other two would almost certainly follow, as
much as a security hedge against each other as for any civilian purpose.
At a minimum, the United States, France, and Russia should refrain from
promoting reprocessing and large fast reactors in the region.18 For
similar reasons, China, Japan, and South Korea are each interested in
significantly expanding their capacity to enrich uranium even though
there is a surfeit of uranium enrichment capacity worldwide. South Korea
also is interested in developing naval reactors, which would require
enriched uranium fuel.19 This raises the question of how naval reactor
fuels might be inspected and controlled by the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA), not just in South Korea but also in Brazil, Iran,
and Pakistan―states that have also expressed an interest in developing
naval reactors.20 To head this off, it would be helpful to call for a
freeze on the deployment of any additional commercial uranium enrichment
capacity in China, Japan, and South Korea (and North Korea, if
possible).21

As already noted, the United States and Russia maintain surplus nuclear
weapons and nuclear weapons materials stockpiles, and India, Israel,
Pakistan, China, Japan, France, and the United Kingdom hold significant
amounts of nuclear explosive plutonium and uranium. This fissile
material overhang increases security uncertainties as to how many
nuclear weapons these states might have or could fashion relatively
quickly. Given the verification difficulties with a proposed fissile
material cutoff treaty and the improbabilities of such a treaty being
brought into force, it would be useful to consider control
alternatives.22

One idea, backed by several analysts and former officials, is a
voluntary initiative known as the Fissile Material Control Initiative
(FMCI).23 It would call on nuclear weapons-usable material producing
states to set aside whatever fissile materials they have in excess of
their immediate military or civilian requirements for either final
disposition or internationally verified safekeeping. Russia and the
United States have already agreed to dispose of 34 tons of weapons-grade
plutonium, and have blended down 683 tons of weapons-grade uranium for
use in civilian reactors. Much more could be done to dispose of, and end
production of, such weapons-usable nuclear materials, not only in the
United States and Russia, but also in other fissile-producing states,
including those in Asia.24

RECOMMENDATION 2

Encourage nuclear supplier states to condition their further export of
civilian nuclear plants upon the recipients forswearing reprocessing
spent reactor fuel and enriching uranium and press the IAEA to be more
candid about what it can safeguard. Will Iran's pursuit of "peaceful"
nuclear energy serve as a model for Saudi Arabia (which says it wants to
build 16 large power reactors before 2035), Turkey (which says it plans
to build 20), Egypt (4), and Algeria (3)? When asked, none of these
countries' officials has been willing to forgo making nuclear fuel. So
far, only Turkey and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have ratified the
IAEA's tougher nuclear inspection regime under the Additional Protocol.
There also is the outstanding issue of whether the United States will
eventually authorize South Korea to recycle U.S.-origin nuclear
materials.

All of this should be a worry, since, as already noted, the IAEA cannot
find covert enrichment or reprocessing facilities or reactor plants with
much confidence (compare to recent history regarding nuclear plants in
Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Syria). Once a large reactor operates in a
country, fresh LEU becomes available and raises the possibility that it
could be seized for possible further enrichment to weapons grade in a
covert or declared enrichment plant. Alternatively, the reactor's
plutonium-laden spent fuel could be reprocessed to produce many bombs'
worth of plutonium. Unfortunately, IAEA inspections at declared
commercial-sized uranium hexafluoride and enrichment plants, plutonium
separation facilities, and plutonium fuel production plants could lose
track of several scores of bombs' worth of nuclear explosive material
annually.

The Gold Standard

Given these points and recognizing that the authority to inspect
anywhere at any time without notice is not yet available to the IAEA
(even when it operates under the Additional Protocol), any state's
pledge not to conduct reprocessing or enrichment could not be fully
verified in a timely manner. Still, securing such a legal pledge would
have some value: it would put a violating country on the wrong side of
international law if or when it was found out, and would make such
action sanctionable. This may not be as much as one wants or needs, but
it is far more of a deterrent to nuclear misbehavior than what current
nonproliferation limits afford.

Other than the United States, no nuclear supplier state (i.e., Russia,
France, Japan, China, or South Korea) has yet required any of its
prospective customers to foreswear enriching uranium or reprocessing
spent fuel to extract plutonium, or committing to ratify the Additional
Protocol. It is unclear how far the United States will push states to do
so (i.e., demanding what is called the nonproliferation gold standard
for civil nuclear cooperation agreements).25

There is some support in the U.S. Congress for making it more difficult
to finalize any future U.S. nuclear cooperative agreements with
nonnuclear weapons states like Saudi Arabia unless they agree to the
U.S.-UAE nuclear cooperative conditions.26 These congressional
representatives believe that by taking the lead on imposing such
nonproliferation conditions, the United States would be in a much better
position to persuade other nuclear supplier states to do the same.

With the Japanese and South Koreans, close U.S. nuclear cooperation and
security guarantees could be leveraged to secure these countries'
agreement to such conditions on their nuclear exports. They and the
Chinese want to export reactors based on U.S. designs. It is unclear
whether they can do so legally to states that do not have a nuclear
cooperative agreement with the United States. China, meanwhile, needs
all the help it can get from the United States to complete the
Westinghouse-designed reactors it is building and the Chinese variant on
which it is basing much of its nuclear future. Moreover, France may have
difficulty exporting reactors without significant Asian support.27 With
Russia as well as China, the United States should be more candid about
the safety issues that the construction and operation of their reactors
present and offer to renew or expand nuclear cooperation to help resolve
these concerns in exchange for upgrading the nonproliferation conditions
on these countries' nuclear exports.28 Finally, the United States should
approach URENCO about requiring recipients of uranium exports not to
enrich or reprocess these materials without URENCO's consent.

Timely Detection

It also would be helpful if the IAEA was more honest about what kinds of
nuclear activities and material holdings it can actually safeguard
effectively---i.e., which ones it can inspect so as to detect military
diversions in a timely fashion and which ones it cannot. As it is, the
IAEA is unwilling to make public its assessments of the agency's ability
to meet its own timeliness detection goals (which are hardly strict).
Meanwhile, no state, including the United States, has yet done such an
assessment of the effectiveness of the agency's safeguards.29

In the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, when only a handful of states
lacking nuclear weapons were interested in enriching uranium or
separating plutonium from spent reactor fuel, this lax approach may have
been tolerable. Today, however, Japan, South Korea, Argentina, Brazil,
South Africa, Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Vietnam, and Jordan are
all either making enriched uranium, reprocessing spent reactor fuels, or
reserving their "right" to do so. All of these states are members of the
NPT and have pledged not to acquire nuclear weapons. Should we assume
that none of them would ever cheat? What confidence should we have that
the IAEA would be able to detect possible diversions early enough for
the other NPT members to intervene to prevent them from producing
nuclear weapons?

Currently, the IAEA's own nuclear safeguard guidelines set routine
inspection intervals to approximate the time the agency estimates is
needed to convert certain special nuclear materials into bomb cores. The
IAEA's ability to verify production figures at large uranium
hexafluoride (reprocessing, uranium enrichment, and plutonium and mixed
oxide fuel fabrication) plants though, is limited. Not only does the
agency have difficulty detecting abrupt diversions in a timely fashion
(i.e., it may only be able to learn of diversions after they have
occurred), but the margins of error associated with the IAEA's ability
to detect small, incremental diversions are equivalent to many bombs'
worth every year. In either case, once a state has enough fissile
material to make a bomb, it could break out well before the IAEA or
other states could intervene to prevent nuclear weapons from being
built.

These facts are troubling. What makes them doubly so is that the IAEA
has yet to share these specifics publicly in any detail. Worse, it
continues to claim that it can safeguard these materials and plants
(i.e., provide "timely detection" of possible military nuclear
diversions), when, in fact, in many cases, it cannot.

It is essential that inspectors and diplomats distinguish between what
inspectors can merely monitor (i.e., inspect to provide confidence that
major diversions have not taken place sometime in the past) from what
they can actually safeguard (i.e., inspect to assure detection of
military diversions early enough so outside parties have sufficient time
to block actual bomb making). If this distinction were made clear,
governments could fully appreciate and, perhaps restrict, nuclear
activities and holdings that are not able to be safeguarded and hence
are dangerous.30 This, in turn, would make promoting tougher
nonproliferation standards, like the Gold Standard, much easier.

RECOMMENDATION 3

Anticipate and ward off nuclear proliferation developments before
recognized redlines have been clearly violated. One of the regrettable
legacies of the Cold War is the habit U.S. and allied government
officials have acquired of waiting for irrefutable evidence of
undesirable, foreign nuclear weapons developments before taking action.
This must change.

After the Soviet Union first acquired nuclear weapons in 1949, the
West's aim in competing against it was not so much to prevent Russia
from acquiring more strategic weapons as it was to prevent it from
gaining strategic superiority. For this purpose, it was sufficient that
Western military forces remained more modern and sufficiently numerous
to deter Soviet offensive capabilities---i.e., that Russia's strategic
technology stayed roughly one or more generations behind ours so that
its strategic deployments could never change the relative balance of
power. If Russia deployed a new strategic nuclear rocket, Washington
would focus on what the Soviets had built and build a bigger or better
U.S. version, or develop some new passive or active defenses, or build
counter offensive forces that could neutralize the new Soviet weapon
system.

After the United States and Russia ratified a number of strategic arms
limitation agreements, any Russian strategic nuclear deployment that
exceeded agreed limits became a matter for diplomatic adjudication. In
either case, U.S. or allied action turned on detecting and verifying the
violation of agreed or implicit redlines. Fortunately, in this
competition, the Soviets ultimately failed to keep up with the United
States and its allies. Moscow's failed attempts to do so only helped
bankrupt it financially and politically.31

**[horizontal]{.underline}** [proliferation, [the objective

### 2ac -- leaks -- russia impact

#### Leaks empower Russian aggression that destroys the LIO

Constantine A. **Pagedas 17**, Executive vice president at International
Technology and Trade Associates, Inc, "Returning to Relevance: the
Russian Challenge to Geopolitical Stability," Japan Spotlight,
March/April 2017,
http://www.itta.com/sites/default/files/files/pagedas_russian_challenge_to_geopolitical_stability.pdf

Today, aggressive Russian behavior on the world stage and a similar
neurotic worldview poses serious risks to the geopolitical stability of
the United States and Europe. As a former KGB intelligence officer in
East Germany who saw firsthand the decline of Soviet influence within
the Warsaw Pact, since coming to power in late 1999 Russian President
Vladimir Putin has been a strong proponent of restoring Russian power
and prestige in the world and diminishing the political, economic, and
geostrategic foundations of the transatlantic partnership. Over the past
few years, however, [the Russian president has shown himself to be
increasingly]{.underline} like some of [his]{.underline}
**[predecessors]{.underline}** [as the US and Europe have been
preoccupied with costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the rise of
international terrorist organizations]{.underline} such as al-Qaeda and
the Islamic State, the Syrian civil war [and the refugee crisis it
created, the eurozone debt crisis, and the rise of China]{.underline} as
a geostrategic competitor. [Under]{.underline} [**Putin's direction**,
Russia has engaged in a series of]{.underline} **[important
actions]{.underline}** [that have not only]{.underline} **[advanced
Russian interests]{.underline}** [worldwide, but have also threatened to
undermine the]{.underline} **[foundations of the geopolitical
order]{.underline}** that have existed since the end of World War II.

Putin's "Strong Man" Politics

From its origins as the Grand Duchy of Moscow that grew to become the
Russian Empire, evolved into the Soviet Union, and finally into today's
modern authoritarian state, Russia has depended on strong, centralized
government control to preside over its vast geographic territory and its
multi-ethnic population. Over the centuries, Russian nationalism and
cold-blooded rule from Moscow or St. Petersburg became ingrained in the
leadership of Russian political calculation and combined with what
Kennan called the "traditional and instinctive Russian sense of
insecurity ... \[because\] Russian rulers have invariably sensed that
their rule was relatively archaic in form, fragile and artificial in its
psychological foundation, unable to stand comparison or contact with
political systems of western countries."

Indeed, Putin has followed in varying degrees the blueprints of previous
strong men who have led Russia such as Peter the Great, Emperor Nicholas
I, and of course, Stalin. Whenever opportunities presented themselves,
Moscow advanced its geopolitical position either directly through
military aggression or, as Kennan wrote, Russian diplomacy would focus
on "inhibiting or diluting the power of others". As such, Putin's two
overarching geostrategic goals since coming to power have been the
restoration of Russia's previous status as a global superpower, to
include rebuilding the Russian armed forces and regaining or controlling
some of the territories in Russia's "near abroad" in Eastern Europe and
the Black Sea region lost after the end of the Cold War, and distancing
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries from Eastern
Europe and from each other.

Russian history has shown that callous and ruthless control of Russia's
domestic politics is a prerequisite for any successful Russian foreign
and national security policy. From 2000 until 2008, Putin radically
amended the 1993 Russian constitution to make an already strong
presidency even stronger. Overall, Putin's time in office so far has
been marked by the growth of authoritarian rule coupled with a corrupt
bureaucracy that favors a few oligarchs who control the country's
critical infrastructure and key industries and who primarily answer only
to the Russian president. Initially limited to two four-year terms as
president, Putin then served as prime minister from 2008 until 2012,
only to return as president to begin a six-year term in March 2012
through what were widely perceived to be unfair elections.

In addition, Putin has been responsible for significantly curbing
democratic freedoms and for the repression of domestic political
dissent. Under Putin's leadership, Russia has also implemented several
restrictive laws against minority groups, harassed, intimidated, and
imprisoned political activists, and cracked down on critics in the
Russian media who contradict or oppose the government's line. The
international watchdog group Freedom House rates Russia very poorly in
terms of government openness and political liberty, noting especially
that "Decisions are adopted behind closed doors by a small group of
individuals --- led by Putin --- whose identities are not often clear,
and announced to the population after the fact. Corruption in the
government and business world is pervasive, and a growing lack of
accountability enables bureaucrats to act with impunity." Putin will be
up for re-election in 2018 for another six-year term while his United
Russia party has strongly benefited from recent changes to national,
regional, and local election laws to ensure continuity of Putin's
political control of Russia for some time to come.

Russia's Military Buildup under Putin

One of the primary ways in which Russia is trying to elevate its
geopolitical power is with respect to the Russian armed forces, where
Putin has prioritized the country's largest military buildup since the
Cold War. According to SIPRI's Military Expenditure Database, Russia's
total military spending in current US dollars grew from approximately
\$11.7 billion in 2001 and peaked at \$88.4 billion in 2014,
representing over a seven-fold increase in military spending. In
addition, many news outlets have claimed that this does not include a
significant number of unreported programs, making the growth of Russia's
military spending higher still. Some organizations such as the
International Monetary Fund have even estimated that the unreported
share of Russia's military budget in 2016 may be nearly 25% more than
what the Russian government has officially claimed.

In 2010, Russia embarked on a 10-year program to increase the size of
its military as well as modernize, update, or replace approximately 70%
of its aging and obsolete military equipment by 2020. The number of
Russians serving active duty in its military has also significantly
grown to an estimated 850,000 in 2014 at a time when the number of
troops in almost every Western country has been dropping (Photo 2).

At the same time, the Russian government's rearmament program is seeing
a technologically much improved force taking shape, which according to
IHS Jane's includes plans calling for more than 600 fixed-wing aircraft,
more than 1,000 helicopters, over 4,600 heavily armored tracked vehicles
and 17,000 lighter military vehicles, 50 surface ships, 28 ballistic
missile and attack submarines, as well as improvements to various
short-, medium-, and long-range missiles and mobile missile systems.
Russia is currently positioning its upgraded military force in various
key geostrategic locations around the country and its near abroad to
potentially challenge NATO forces in Eastern Europe, to consolidate its
existing military gains in Ukraine, and to project Russian power in the
Black Sea region and beyond in the Middle East.

Nowhere is Russia's growing military capability on full display to NATO
and the rest of the world than in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad,
located on the Baltic Sea and nestled between Poland and Lithuania.
Kaliningrad is the home of Russia's Baltic Fleet (Photo 3), which
according to publicly available data comprises approximately 50
different vessels, including diesel-powered submarines, one
Sovremenny-class destroyer, eight Steregushchyand Nanuchka-class missile
corvettes, two Neustrashimy-class guided missile frigates, six
Paschim-class anti-submarine warfare vessels, and a few dozen smaller
vessels and landing ships, together with one brigade of naval infantry
and two regiments of coastal defense artillery, along with a garrison
with an estimated 200,000 military personnel --- despite official
Russian numbers claiming only 100,000. Other significant upgrades to
Kaliningrad's military infrastructure have occurred in the past couple
of years, including the reconstruction and enlargement of the airfield
at Chkalovsk to accommodate large military aircraft, as well as the
refurbishment of an abandoned Soviet-era airfield for hydroplanes on the
Baltic Spit.

In early October 2016, significant East-West tensions were raised when
Moscow deployed Iskander-M mobile systems to Kaliningrad (Photo 4).
First introduced to the Russian military in 2013, the Iskander-M is able
to target enemy missile systems, rocket launchers, long-range artillery,
and command posts, as well as aircraft and helicopters at a distance of
up to 320 miles --- threatening much of eastern Poland and all of
Lithuania. Tensions were further raised later in the month when Russia
sent to the Baltic Sea two Buyan-M class corvettes armed with
nuclear-capable Kalibr cruise missiles which have a range of 930 miles.
According to Russian news sources, there are also plans for Russia's
Baltic Fleet to receive three additional such warships armed with Kalibr
missiles by the end of 2020 along with enhanced coastal defenses
including Bastion and Bal land-based antiship missile systems. Russia's
current and planned military buildup of Kaliningrad is protected by its
existing long-range radar and its S-400 Triumf air defense system which
has a 250-mile range and provides the surrounding region with a fairly
sophisticated anti-access/area denial capability for the Russian
military.

Hybrid Warfare & Power Projection

As highlighted in a previous issue of this magazine (July/August 2014),
a resurgent Russia under Putin has also seen Russian aggression
successfully used to secure Russia's "near abroad" --- most notably
against Ukraine. Beginning in March 2014, Russia annexed the Crimean
peninsula and its key naval base at Sevastopol. Russia then divided the
eastern, ethnically Russian, and highly industrialized areas of its
neighbor from the western, ethnically Ukrainian, and mostly agricultural
areas. Moscow not only accomplished this by arming and supplying local
separatists, but also by utilizing a provocative propaganda campaign to
create political unrest with hacked information that included the
broadcast of an intercepted February 2014 telephone call between US
Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and US Ambassador to
Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt describing US brokering of a political deal among
Ukrainian government officials who were then negotiating the formation
of a new Western-leaning government. The disclosure of this conversation
seemed to prove American involvement in the local politics of a country
bordering Russia and that the US was working directly against Russian
interests.

Other Russian actions in Ukraine included spreading "fake news" stories,
interrupting energy flows, and even sending in Spetsnaz special forces
units, the masked and unmarked camouflage-wearing "Little Green Men",
whose mission was to take control of key strategic locations in the
country such as military bases, airports, and government buildings in
eastern Ukraine (Photo 5). Out of the success of Russia's barely
disguised aggression against its neighbor, experts have come up with the
term "hybrid warfare" which has come to describe these "gray areas" of
Russian military and paramilitary activities to support favorable
political outcomes. Indeed, recent Russian activities with respect to
Ukraine harken back to the early Cold War period when Stalin's
government was similarly able to pressure, undermine, and ultimately
control most of Eastern Europe.

Beyond its immediate border regions, Russia has also actively supported
the regime of Bashar al-Assad since the beginning of the Syrian civil
war in 2011. As longtime allies dating to the early Cold War period,
Russia initially resisted Western calls in the United Nations Security
Council for Assad to step down from power or to implement UN sanctions
against Syria. As the crisis intensified, Russia provided Syrian
government forces with military aid to suppress the rebel opposition,
specifically the US-supported Free Syrian Army (FSA) trying to overthrow
the government in Damascus. Since September 2015, however, Russia has
engaged in direct military operations to not only secure Assad's regime
and to defeat the FSA and other rebel forces, but also to overthrow the
self-declared Islamic State straddling northwestern Syria and northern
Iraq.

Russian forces have been primarily operating out of the airbase near
Latakia and the port of Tartus, as well as from an aircraft carrier
battlegroup in the Eastern Mediterranean, conducting significant and
sustained Russian airstrikes on key rebel towns and villages (up to 60
per day) for the better part of two years. It should be highlighted,
however, that the Russian military involvement in Syria has not been
completely void of international incident. In November 2015, Turkey's
air force shot down a Russian Sukhoi Su-24 strike aircraft for allegedly
violating Turkish airspace, temporarily resulting in increased regional
tensions. Moreover, Russia has come under strong political condemnation
from the international community for airstrikes that are believed to
have deliberately struck civilian targets such as hospitals, schools,
and homes, especially in and around the destroyed city of Aleppo --- the
epicenter of the Syrian crisis. From a military perspective, however,
the projection of Russian military power in support of the regime in
Damascus is widely seen to have successfully turned the tide of the
Syrian civil war in Assad's favor and helped Syrian government forces
recapture large areas of lost territory. It is the first time since the
Cold War that Russia has engaged in sustained military operations beyond
its immediate borders, and is another sign of Russia's intent to
overturn the post1991 geopolitical order.

Hybrid Politics & Kompromat

The famous dictum by the military theorist Carl von Clausewitz that "war
is a mere continuation of politics by other means" certainly holds true
today. In today's technologically advanced global environment, however,
Putin also appears to be turning this famous line on its head --- that
influencing politics may also be a mere continuation of war by other
means. In this era dominated by mass communication through smartphones
and social media, along with the relative ease and low cost of
cyberwarfare, democratic political processes --- particularly those of
open, Western societies whose governments do not restrict their
citizens' access to the Internet --- are vulnerable to Russian influence
campaigns. Indeed, as much as Russia's hybrid warfare can be seen as a
success in destabilizing Ukraine and annexing Crimea, this era may also
be one characterized by hybrid politics, whereby democratic institutions
or processes can be manipulated or undermined through the release of
intelligence, disinformation, or compromising information (known in
Russian as kompromat) that has been hacked or otherwise acquired to
tarnish the reputation, or question the legitimacy, of an intended
political target, and thus used to achieve a political outcome favorable
to the Kremlin. The main idea behind kompromat is to create plausible
truths about intended political victims, while also allowing Russian
leadership plausible denial regarding the origin of the leaked
information.

Certainly, Putin's background, training, and experiences in
intelligence, deception, and misinformation for the KGB and its
successor, the FSB, are important puzzle pieces in the development of
Russian hybrid politics. First, as a young major in the Soviet secret
police who spent the late 1980s working closely with the East German
Stasi in Dresden and recruiting people trained in "wireless
communications" to steal Western technology and NATO secrets, and then
in the late 1990s as FSB director, Putin reportedly became not only
expert in blatant disregard for the truth about Russian military
activities and casualty rates during the war in Chechnya, but also more
than capable of inventing and distributing self-serving lies and
inaccurate information to sow confusion among political opponents and
ultimately to control them.

[A]{.underline}nother [reason for the growth of Russian]{.underline}
**[hybrid politics]{.underline}** [is the]{.underline} current
[**environment in which Western governments operate**. With vast amounts
of **government documents**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[data]{.underline}** [now being stored]{.underline}
[**electronically**, the ease with which this information can be
transferred almost instantaneously is **greater than
ever**]{.underline}. Moreover, [the increased use]{.underline} over the
past two decades [of]{.underline} private sector firms that support key
national security organizations such as [the]{.underline}
**[D]{.underline}**epartment **[o]{.underline}**f
**[D]{.underline}**efense, [the]{.underline} **[N]{.underline}**ational
**[S]{.underline}**ecurity **[A]{.underline}**gency, [the]{.underline}
**[C]{.underline}**entral **[I]{.underline}**ntelligence
**[A]{.underline}**gency, and others presents a security challenge which
in some respects is unique to the US. Outside contractors --- private US
citizens who work alongside government employees with many of the same
clearances and therefore access to the same classified government
information --- [today]{.underline} provide countless additional
potential **[exit points]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} government
[information to be]{.underline} **[leaked]{.underline}**.

[Indeed, Russia appears to be connected to a massive]{.underline}
**[info]{.underline}**rmation-**[gathering]{.underline}**
**[effort]{.underline}** on potential political targets [focused on the
US and Europe. Most famously]{.underline}, in June 2013 the outside
contractor Edward **[Snowden]{.underline}** [who was working for the NSA
released **classified documents**]{.underline} to various journalists
and newspapers around the world [revealing information on US government
surveillance programs against other countries, including US allies.
Snowden]{.underline} fled the US and eventually [sought]{.underline}
political [asylum in]{.underline} the waiting arms of
**[Moscow]{.underline}** (Photo 6). The US, UK, and French intelligence
services also all believe [there is a]{.underline} **[direct
connection]{.underline}** [between the Russian government
and]{.underline} the international open government organization
Wiki**[leaks]{.underline}**, whose founder Julian Assange has been
responsible over the past several years for releasing compromising
documents about both the US government and the Democratic presidential
candidate Hillary Clinton.

Finally, Russian hybrid politics is to some extent dependent upon
willing political targets. The Kremlin's attempt to influence the 2016
US presidential election as alleged by the US intelligence community
involved the acquisition and release of compromising information on
Clinton, the opponent of Russia's preferred candidate Donald Trump. For
his part, both on the campaign trail and following his election, Trump
expressed an unusually strong affinity for Putin and Russia, at various
times taking to Twitter to praise the Russian leader as "very smart", to
call upon Russia to release damaging information on Clinton (which some
claimed was treasonous), and even to deflect public attention on
himself, claiming that "Clinton's close ties to Putin deserve scrutiny."

As was the case, Trump won the election in one of the largest upsets in
US political history. Although it is impossible to measure the effect of
Russia's influence on the 2016 US election, Trump cannot condemn Russia
too strongly without casting doubt on the legitimacy of his own
electoral success. Nevertheless, he has been reluctant to assign any
blame to Russia and has dismissed the US intelligence community's
post-election analysis despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary ---
going so far as to fault US intelligence for leaking an unverified
political report alleging financial improprieties and embarrassing
salacious personal behavior about himself (Photo 7). "If Putin likes
Donald Trump," he told a crowd of journalists at a January 2017 press
conference, "guess what, folks, that's called an asset not a liability."

Putin's Annus Mirabilis

Today it is worth remembering that Kennan's Long Telegram concluded with
a stark warning: "We must have the courage and self-confidence to cling
to our own methods and conceptions of human society. After all, the
greatest danger that can befall us in coping with this problem of
\[Russia\], is that we shall allow ourselves to become like those with
whom we are coping."

[The year 2016 may be]{.underline} considered [an]{.underline} **[annus
mirabilis]{.underline}** [for Putin's long-held plan to restore Russia
--- challenging not only the]{.underline} **[global order]{.underline}**
created by the end of the Cold War, [but]{.underline} perhaps [also
overturning the]{.underline} **[very foundations]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} the **[postwar international security]{.underline}**
structure. Under President Barak Obama, the US largely only took
symbolic gestures to confront the buildup of Russia's military
capabilities and its aggression in Ukraine, sending token forces to the
region and imposing sanctions, albeit in coordination with its European
allies and with some economically crippling effects. From the Russian
point of view, however, the election of Trump has already had its
intended effect --- [to create]{.underline} political
**[confusion]{.underline}** [and generate]{.underline}
**[divisions]{.underline}** within the US and **[among]{.underline}**
the members of [**the Western Alliance**, to **divert**]{.underline}
Washington's **[attention]{.underline}** away from Russia's growing
military and intelligence capabilities, [and to]{.underline} **[sow
doubt]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} the US political system and its
**[democratic institutions]{.underline}**.

The year 2017 looks even brighter for Russia and Putin. It appears he
may be gaining a useful political ally in Trump, who indicated he might
even be willing to lift the sanctions on Russia in exchange for Russian
help in the fight against terrorism. In an unmistakable reference to
Russia in his inaugural address, Trump noted that the US would
"reinforce old alliances and form new ones --- and unite the civilized
world against radical Islamic terrorism." Moreover, Trump's enthusiasm
for NATO is low. Just prior to assuming office, he labeled the
organization "obsolete" and is likely to approach European capitals
early in his term with a demand they pay more towards their own
security. As the United Kingdom appears set to trigger negotiations to
exit the European Union, while both France and Germany are facing
national elections with rightwing parties rising in popularity, and as
the new era in Washington begins with strong mutual distrust between
Trump and his own intelligence community, [Russia is in a]{.underline}
**[strong position]{.underline}** [to shape the geopolitical environment
to more closely align with its core national interests and continue its
return to]{.underline} **[great power status and growing global
relevance]{.underline}**.

#### The liberal order prevents extinction from nuclear war, warming, and rogue tech development

Yuval Noah **Harari 18**, Professor of History at Hebrew University of
Jerusalem, 9/26/18, "We need a post-liberal order now," The Economist,
<https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/09/26/we-need-a-post-liberal-order-now>

For several generations, [the world has been governed by]{.underline}
what today we call "[the global liberal order]{.underline}". Behind
these lofty words is [the idea that all humans share some core
experiences, values and interests, and that no human group is inherently
superior]{.underline} to all others. [Cooperation is therefore more
sensible than conflict]{.underline}. All humans should work together to
protect their common values and advance their common interests. And the
best way to foster such cooperation is to ease the movement of ideas,
goods, money and people across the globe.

Though [the global liberal order]{.underline} has many faults and
problems, it [has proved superior to all alternatives]{.underline}. The
liberal world of the early 21st century is more prosperous, healthy and
peaceful than ever before. For the first time in human history,
starvation kills fewer people than obesity; plagues kill fewer people
than old age; and violence kills fewer people than accidents. When I was
six months old I didn't die in an epidemic, thanks to medicines
discovered by foreign scientists in distant lands. When I was three I
didn't starve to death, thanks to wheat grown by foreign farmers
thousands of kilometers away. And when I was eleven I wasn't obliterated
in a nuclear war, thanks to agreements signed by foreign leaders on the
other side of the planet. If you think we should go back to some
pre-liberal golden age, please name the year in which humankind was in
better shape than in the early 21st century. Was it 1918? 1718? 1218?

[Nevertheless, people all over the world are **now losing faith in the
liberal order**. Nationalist]{.underline} and religious
[views]{.underline} that privilege one human group over all others [are
back in vogue]{.underline}. Governments are increasingly restricting the
flow of ideas, goods, money and people. Walls are popping up everywhere,
both on the ground and in cyberspace. Immigration is out, tariffs are
in.

[If the **liberal order is collapsing**, what new kind of global order
might replace it?]{.underline} So far, [those who challenge the liberal
order]{.underline} do so mainly on a national level. They have many
ideas about how to advance the interests of their particular country,
but they [don't have a viable vision for how the world as a whole should
function]{.underline}. For example, Russian nationalism can be a
reasonable guide for running the affairs of Russia, but Russian
nationalism has no plan for the rest of humanity. Unless, of course,
nationalism morphs into imperialism, and calls for one nation to conquer
and rule the entire world. A century ago, several nationalist movements
indeed harboured such imperialist fantasies. Today's nationalists,
whether in Russia, Turkey, Italy or China, so far refrain from
advocating global conquest.

In place of violently establishing a global empire, [some
nationalists]{.underline} such as Steve Bannon, Viktor Orban, the
Northern League in Italy and the British Brexiteers dream about a
peaceful "Nationalist International". They [argue]{.underline} that all
nations today face the same enemies. The bogeymen of globalism,
multiculturalism and immigration are threatening to destroy the
traditions and identities of all nations. Therefore nationalists across
the world should make common cause in opposing these global forces.
Hungarians, Italians, Turks and Israelis should build walls, erect
fences and slow down the movement of people, goods, money and ideas.

[The world will]{.underline} then [be divided into distinct
nation-states]{.underline}, each with its own sacred identity and
traditions. Based on mutual respect for these differing identities, all
nation-states could cooperate and trade peacefully with one another.
Hungary will be Hungarian, Turkey will be Turkish, Israel will be
Israeli, and everyone will know who they are and what is their proper
place in the world. It will be a world without immigration, without
universal values, without multiculturalism, and without a global
elite---but with peaceful international relations and some trade. In a
word, [the "Nationalist International" envisions the world as a network
of walled-but-friendly fortresses]{.underline}.

Many people would think this is quite a reasonable vision. Why isn't it
a viable alternative to the liberal order? Two things should be noted
about it. First, it is still a comparatively liberal vision. It assumes
that no human group is superior to all others, that no nation should
dominate its peers, and that international cooperation is better than
conflict. In fact, liberalism and nationalism were originally closely
aligned with one another. The 19th century liberal nationalists, such as
Giuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Mazzini in Italy, and Adam Mickiewicz in
Poland, dreamt about precisely such an international liberal order of
peacefully-coexisting nations.

The second thing to note about [this vision of friendly
fortresses]{.underline} is that it **[has been
tried]{.underline}**---[and it **failed spectacularly**. **All
attempts** to divide the world into clear-cut nations have]{.underline}
so far **[resulted in war and genocide]{.underline}**. When the heirs of
Garibaldi, Mazzini and Mickiewicz managed to overthrow the multi-ethnic
Habsburg Empire, it proved impossible to find a clear line dividing
Italians from Slovenes or Poles from Ukrainians.

This had set the stage for the second world war. The key problem with
the network of fortresses is that each national fortress wants a bit
more land, security and prosperity for itself at the expense of the
neighbors, and without the help of universal values and global
organisations, rival fortresses cannot agree on any common rules. Walled
fortresses are seldom friendly.

But if you happen to live inside a particularly strong fortress, such as
America or Russia, why should you care? Some nationalists indeed adopt a
more extreme isolationist position. They don't believe in either a
global empire or in a global network of fortresses. Instead, [they deny
the necessity of any global order whatsoever]{.underline}. "Our fortress
should just raise the drawbridges," they say, "and the rest of the world
can go to hell. We should refuse entry to foreign people, foreign ideas
and foreign goods, and as long as our walls are stout and the guards are
loyal, who cares what happens to the foreigners?"

Such extreme isolationism, however, is completely divorced from economic
realities. Without a global trade network, all existing national
economies will collapse---including that of North Korea. Many countries
will not be able even to feed themselves without imports, and prices of
almost all products will skyrocket. The made-in-China shirt I am wearing
cost me about \$5. If it had been produced by Israeli workers from
Israeli-grown cotton using Israeli-made machines powered by non-existing
Israeli oil, it may well have cost ten times as much. Nationalist
leaders from Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin may therefore heap abuse on
the global trade network, but none thinks seriously of taking their
country completely out of that network. And we cannot have a global
trade network without some global order that sets the rules of the game.

Even more importantly, whether people like it or not,
[humankind]{.underline} today [faces]{.underline} three [common problems
that make a mockery of all national borders]{.underline}, and [that can
**only be solved through global cooperation**. These are **nuclear war,
climate change and technological disruption**. You cannot build a wall
against nuclear winter or against global warming, and no nation can
regulate]{.underline} artificial intelligence ([AI) or bioengineering
single-handedly]{.underline}. It won't be enough if only the European
Union forbids producing killer robots or only America bans
genetically-engineering human babies. Due to the immense potential of
such disruptive technologies, if even one country decides to pursue
these high-risk high-gain paths, other countries will be forced to
follow its dangerous lead for fear of being left behind.

[An **AI arms race** or a **biotechnological arms race**]{.underline}
almost [**guarantees the worst outcome**. Whoever wins]{.underline} the
arms race, **[the loser will likely be humanity itself]{.underline}**.
For in an arms race, [all regulations will collapse]{.underline}.
Consider, for example, conducting genetic-engineering experiments on
human babies. Every country will say: "We don't want to conduct such
experiments---we are the good guys. But how do we know our rivals are
not doing it? We cannot afford to remain behind. So we must do it before
them."

Similarly, [consider developing autonomous-weapon systems]{.underline},
that can decide for themselves whether to shoot and kill people. Again,
[every country will say: "This]{.underline} is a very dangerous
technology, and it [should be regulated]{.underline} carefully. [But we
don't trust our rivals to regulate it, so we must develop it
first]{.underline}".

[The **only thing** that can prevent]{.underline} such [destructive arms
races is **greater trust between countries**]{.underline}. [This is
**not an impossible mission**]{.underline}. If today the Germans promise
the French: "Trust us, we aren't developing killer robots in a secret
laboratory under the Bavarian Alps," the French are likely to believe
the Germans, despite the terrible history of these two countries. [We
need to build such trust globally]{.underline}. We need to reach a point
when Americans and Chinese can trust one another like the French and
Germans.

Similarly, we need to create a global safety-net to protect humans
against the economic shocks that AI is likely to cause. Automation will
create immense new wealth in high-tech hubs such as Silicon Valley,
while the worst effects will be felt in developing countries whose
economies depend on cheap manual labor. There will be more jobs to
software engineers in California, but fewer jobs to Mexican factory
workers and truck drivers. We now have a global economy, but politics is
still very national. [Unless we find solutions on a global level to the
disruptions caused by AI, entire countries might collapse, and the
resulting chaos]{.underline}, violence and waves of immigration [will
**destabilise the entire world**]{.underline}.

This is the proper perspective to look at recent developments such as
Brexit. In itself, Brexit isn't necessarily a bad idea. But is this what
Britain and the EU should be dealing with right now? How does Brexit
help prevent nuclear war? How does Brexit help prevent climate change?
How does Brexit help regulate artificial intelligence and
bioengineering? Instead of helping, Brexit makes it harder to solve all
of these problems. Every minute that Britain and the EU spend on Brexit
is one less minute they spend on preventing climate change and on
regulating AI.

In order **[to survive]{.underline}** and flourish [in the 21st century,
humankind needs **effective global cooperation**]{.underline}, and so
far [the **only viable blueprint** for such cooperation is offered by
**liberalism**. Nevertheless, governments all over the world are
undermining the foundations of the liberal order]{.underline}, and the
world is turning into a network of fortresses. [The first to feel the
impact are the weakest members of humanity]{.underline}, who find
themselves without any fortress willing to protect them: refugees,
illegal migrants, persecuted minorities. [But if the walls keep
rising]{.underline}, eventually **[the whole of humankind will feel the
squeeze]{.underline}**.
