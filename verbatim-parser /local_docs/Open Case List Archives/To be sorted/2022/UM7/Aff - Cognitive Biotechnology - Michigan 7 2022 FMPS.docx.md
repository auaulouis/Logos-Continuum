\*IHL = international humanitarian law

Consequently, it has been predicted that [human enhancements will be
commonplace within military operations]{.underline} in the near future26
, [spurning]{.underline} governmental interest in [a 'Bio-Revolution' to
develop]{.underline} their [military forces to surpass human beings'
innate limitations]{.underline}27 to 'make the individual warfighter
stronger, more alert, more endurant, and better able to heal'28 , and
reducing or eliminating the physiological, psychological or cognitive
limitations that impaired soldiers' 'operational dominance' 29 that have
traditionally acted as inhibitors of warfare.30 However, [the pursuit
of]{.underline} this ['Bio-revolution' has revealed countries' true
intentions of thirsting to create]{.underline} the [ultimate killing
machine that surpasses the capabilities of traditional unenhanced
soldiers]{.underline}31 . As a result, **[this has produced a modernised
arms-race that is rapidly outpacing policy development regulating the
development and deployment of enhancement modalities]{.underline}** ,
leaving some states to continue untrammelled in their pursuits, whilst
others signal the need for legal and ethical evaluation to inform
enhanced soldiers' development33 . Albeit the intersection of ethics and
soldier enhancement receiving avid attention in academic circles, there
remains a paucity of discussion regarding IHL and human enhancement34
despite IHL's integral nature in regulating wartime developments by
striking a balance between military necessity and humanity. For
clarity's sake, [if military **necessity** or **winning** a battle
**whatever the cost** was to be the overriding guiding principle in
warfare, **any humanity** in military conduct would be
**discarded**]{.underline}, [unleashing]{.underline} a carte Blanche
**[Pandora's Box]{.underline}**36 [of the brutality of war]{.underline}.
As aptly put by Enemark: 'if war is to remain \[...\] a pursuit more
virtuous than organized murder, it is vital also to think in terms of
what is permissible... ethics is thus constitutive of the practice of
war as a form of violence that is (or is held to be) morally
distinguishable from other forms' 37 . In essence, human enhancement has
a myriad of varying forms that stands to either severely denigrate or
significantly improve compliance with the fundamental principles of IHL,
albeit the preponderance of commentators remaining sceptical as to any
auspicious application. Expressing that [human enhancement
will]{.underline} 'quicky [diminish']{.underline} the '[existing
ethical]{.underline}, customary, [and]{.underline} [legal norms of
warfare]{.underline} as [inscribed]{.underline} . . . [\[within\] the
Geneva Conventions]{.underline}'' 38 , and that new technologies mark a
paradigm shift that cannot be easily accommodated by current IHL
frameworks39 , it has led to calls for the updating of the current IHL
framework to reflect modern battlefield techniques and operations40 . As
expressed by Nayef Al-Rodhan, '[with roughly onethird of all military
research worldwide being devoted to tech]{.underline}nology, the [era of
using super soldiers will require us to]{.underline} occasionally
**[rewrite the rules of war]{.underline}** within the Geneva
Conventions'.

#### Scenario 1 -- Neuro Weaponization -- 

#### There is a massive race between the US and adversaries in neuroS/T research now -- risks weaponization

The human brain, with its approximately 100 billion interconnected
neurons, enables our higher cognitive abilities without being a
physiological outlier from other primate species (Herculano-Houzel,
Reference Herculano-Houzel2012). This incredibly complex organ can also
host debilitating clinical disorders, including seizures, depression and
anxiety, Parkinson's disease, and many others. Unlocking the secrets of
the human brain is one of the largest scientific challenges to ever be
undertaken. [Advances in neuroscience research have enabled us to
further our understanding of the brain and develop technologies to read
and write brain activity, with implications for understanding behavior
and decision-making.]{.underline}

In the past decade, [the United States and the People's Republic of
China have begun large neuroscience research projects]{.underline} along
with several other international actors, including Canada, Korea, Japan,
Australia, and the European Union (EU) (International Brain Initiative,
n.d.). These brain initiatives have ambitious goals that are only now
possible with advances in genetic tools and imaging techniques (National
Institutes of Health, n.d.c). The U.S. BRAIN (Brain Research through
Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Initiative has a stated goal of
"accelerating the development and application of innovative technologies
... to produce a revolutionary new dynamic picture of the brain that ...
shows how individual cells and complex neural circuits interact in both
time and space" (National Institutes of Health, n.d.b). Additionally,
the BRAIN Initiative was highlighted as a major component of the United
States' innovation strategy for breakthrough technologies (Office of
Science and Technology Policy, 2015). The China Brain Project's
framework focuses on the ability to develop technologies both for
diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders and for mimicking human
intelligence and connecting humans and machines (Poo et al., Reference
Poo, Du, Ip, Xiong, Xu and Tan2016).

[While the initial public focus of these brain projects has been
clinical technologies to cure disease and return faculties to people,
such research is likely to enable augmentation and use for healthy
people in both the commercial and military sectors. The U.S. BRAIN
Initiative and the China Brain Project emphasize]{.underline} the
importance of [neuroscience research to treat and prevent brain
disorders]{.underline} in aging populations, [but]{.underline} they
[also]{.underline} highlight additional goals for
[accelerating]{.underline} basic research in the United States and
[applied research in]{.underline} [human-machine teaming]{.underline} in
China (National Institutes of Health, n.d.b; Poo et al., Reference Poo,
Du, Ip, Xiong, Xu and Tan2016). [The]{.underline} [dual-use technologies
made possible by all seven brain projects are likely to have profound
implications for society, public health, and national security. From a
national security perspective, it would be valuable to be able to
predict the dissemination of neurotechnologies to both the commercial
and military sectors.]{.underline} This research presents the first
analytical framework that attempts to do so.

Like past scientific and technological breakthroughs, [cognitive
sciences research is purported to have an impact on future security
policies]{.underline}. Since the cognitive sciences focus on humans,
they are intricately tied to the study of social processes, including
the realms of politics and security. International scientific bodies,
including the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the United Kingdom's
Royal Society, have also engaged in discussions on the field's policy
relevance (National Research Council, 2008, 2009; Royal Society,
Reference Society2012[). Experts]{.underline} involved in
[developing]{.underline} [NATO's]{.underline} New [Strategic
Concept]{.underline} released in 2010 [noted]{.underline} that "less
predictable is the possibility that research breakthroughs will
transform the technological battlefield," and that "[allies and partners
should be alert for potentially disruptive developments]{.underline} in
such dynamic areas as information and communications technology,
cognitive and biological sciences, robotics, and nanotechnology" (NATO,
2010, p. 15; emphasis added). [Interest in neurosciences is not limited
to any specific nation, and the potential for new technology to affect
conflict and cooperation has been recognized]{.underline}.

[Security-related research in neuroscience and operationalization of
scientific discoveries into commercial or deployable neurotechnologies
present concerns for policymakers and scholars]{.underline}. Not only do
the effects and use of military applications of cognitive science and
neuroscience research require their attention, but also the [increasing
understanding of cognitive processes continues to provide new
perspectives on how we understand policy and politics.]{.underline}

**[The weaponization of neuroS/T in military/warfare
contexts]{.underline}** (**[e.g., combat]{.underline}**) **[seeks to
alter functions of the nervous system to affect physical and/or
cognitive capabilities required for military operations]{.underline}**.
As noted, [the weaponized use of neuroscientific tools and products is
not new]{.underline}. Historically, **[such weapons have included nerve
gas and various drugs]{.underline}**. Weaponized gas has taken several
forms: lachrymatory agents (e.g., tear gases), toxic irritants (e.g.,
phosgene, chlorine), vesicants (blistering agents; e.g., mustard gas),
and paralytics (e.g., sarin). Pharmacologic stimulants (e.g.,
amphetamines) and various ergogenics (e.g., anabolic steroids) have been
used to augment performance of combatants, and sedatives (e.g.,
barbiturates) have been employed to enhance cooperation during
interrogation. **[Sensory stimuli]{.underline}** (e.g., high intensity
sound, prolonged flashing lights, irritating music or noise) **[have
been applied as neuroweapons to incapacitate the enemy, and even sleep
deprivation and distribution of emotionally provocative information
in]{.underline}** psychological operations (i.e.,
**[PSYOPS]{.underline}**) **[could rightly be regarded as forms of
weaponized applications of neuroscientific and neurocognitive
research]{.underline}**. [The 2013 conflict in Syria involving the use
of nerve gas, as well as the use of the neuroactive agent VX to
assassinate Kim Jong-nam, estranged half-brother of North Korean leader
Kim Jong-un, demonstrate the ongoing relevance of nervous system
targets]{.underline}. Indeed, **[North Korea affords a prime example of
a state resorting to chemical weapons in order to gain advantage when
their military is out-competed by other nations']{.underline}**.

Moreover, **[computational neuroscience and neuropharmacologic research
could be more indirectly utilized to optimize human functions modulating
brain activity instrumental to signal detection and integration, so as
to bio-engineer aspects of "human weak links" out of the chain(s) of
military and intelligence operations]{.underline}**. There is additional
interest in employing neurotechnology to augment the role, capability,
and effects of PSYOPS in military and political missions. Programs such
as Sociocultural Content in Language (SCIL) and the Metaphor program at
IARPA were directed toward improving insight into cultural linguistic
and emotional norms, and DARPA's Narrative Networks entailed a
neurocognitive approach to understanding and modelling narratives in
socio-cultural contexts. As noted in several SMA reports to the
Pentagon, [the intent and desired outcome of this research is an
improved understanding of neural bases and effects of narratives that
can afford insights to influences and processes that affect brain
development, function, and behavior which can be operationalized to
mitigate violence on a variety of scales]{.underline}.

[Additionally there is ongoing neuropharmacologic, neurotoxicologic,
neuromicrobiologic, and neurotechnologic research that has potential to
develop non-lethal or lethal weapons in combat related and/or special
operations' deterrence operations]{.underline}. Weaponizable products of
neuroscientific and neurotechnological research can be utilized to
affect 1) memory, learning, and cognitive speed; 2) wake-sleep cycles,
fatigue, and alertness; 3) impulse control; 4) mood, anxiety, and
self-perception; 5) decision-making; 6) trust and empathy; and 7)
movement and performance (e.g., speed, strength, stamina, motor
learning, etc.).

As summarized by Table 3, **[non-lethal and lethal neuroweapons include
various categories and classes of psycho-neuroactive drugs, a variety of
microbial agents]{.underline}** (**[e.g., bacterial and viral
strains]{.underline}**) **[that act directly or exert effect upon the
central and/or peripheral nervous system; organic toxins; and
neurotechnological devices]{.underline}** (e.g., sensory and brain
stimulation approaches) **[and products]{.underline}** (e.g.,
nanotechnologically derived substances[). Additionally, brain-machine
interfacing and neural network derived computational decision systems
could be employed to develop remote control or
autonomous/semi-autonomous capability for unmanned aerial, ground, and
marine]{.underline} (surface and subsurface) [vehicles that could
function as weapon platforms]{.underline}. The use of unmanned vehicles
as weapons is not novel, and the realization of fully autonomous
capability is iterative. [Such progression and integration of
neurotechnologically-enabled capabilities render these weapons
increasingly viable and therefore a source of trepidation about
near-term future developments that could be generated from ongoing
research in neural architectures and human-machine systems]{.underline}.

Neurodata10

[The conjoinment of the physical, social, and computational sciences and
concomitant "technique and technology sharing" has synergized the pace
and breadth of discoveries and developments in the
neurosciences]{.underline}. Such advanced integrative scientific
convergence (AISC) paradigmatically de-silos disciplines to establish
and sustain complementary knowledge and skills to create new methods and
tools to (1) foster innovation and (2) further understanding and
capability. 11 The AISC approach relies upon computational (i.e., big
data) systems to allow the level(s) and scope of multi-tiered
informational acquisition, processing, assimilation, and synthesis
required for neuroS/t research and its translational applications.
**[Taken together, the capabilities of computational and brain sciences
have biosecurity and defense implications]{.underline}**. **[While much
of weaponizable neuroS/T]{.underline}** (**[e.g., chemicals, biological
agents, and toxins]{.underline}**) **[are addressed in and by extant
forums, treaties, conventions, and laws, newer techniques and
technologies]{.underline}**---**[including
neurodata]{.underline}**---**[have not]{.underline}**. "Neurodata" is
defined as the gathering and use of multi-scalar information to (1)
establish increasingly detailed assessment of brain structure and
function and (2) develop large-scale databases to enable (descriptive
and/or predictive) evaluative metrics (for clinical medicine, law,
socio-economic, and potentially political uses).

[Of note is that the rapidity of such advances can]{.underline}---[and
often does]{.underline}---[outpace securitization, and the uniquity of
brain science and its applications]{.underline}---and meanings---[render
particular security vulnerabilities]{.underline}. Namely, the fact that
the brain is regarded as the "source of the mind," and all of the
functions and implications arising therein, establishes a normative
aspect to neurodata. Simply put, [neurodata can afford bases of what
constitutes "normality" of brain structure, and functions]{.underline}
(viz., thought, emotion, and behavior). [Access to such information can
enable insertion of data]{.underline} (e.g., in medical records,
databases, registries, etc.) [to alter the normative stature of targeted
individuals]{.underline} (e.g., developing data profiles that depict
them to have, be premorbid for, and/or predisposed to neurological and
psychiatric conditions). **[Access and use of this information could
impact national security by affecting]{.underline}** (1) **[the type of
medical care that is (or is not) provided to both civilian and military
populations; and]{.underline}** (2) **[ways that individuals and groups
are socially, economically, legally, and politically regarded and
treated]{.underline}**.

**[Neurodata can also afford genotypic and phenotypic information that
can be used to develop "precision pathogens" capable of selectively
affecting specific targets]{.underline}** (e.g., individuals,
communities, domestic animals, livestock, etc.). [Recent development in
gene editing tools and techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas 9]{.underline}
(when employed with other, existing molecular biological methods), [can
facilitate both the modification of extant agents to be more viable,
durable, and/or virulent, as well as the development of novel bacteria
and viruses that have unique properties, specific affinities, and/or no
known treatment]{.underline}. **[The COVID-19 pandemic has put into
stark relief those ways that public reaction]{.underline}**---
**[and]{.underline}** public health preparedness, **[readiness, and
response]{.underline}**(s)---**[could be engaged by the use of
"precision pathologies" and disseminated misinformation to incur
multi-domain and multidimensional disruptions within
society]{.underline}** (and military and intelligence communities) **[to
incur and exploit weak elements of]{.underline}** public health, social
**[stability, and national security]{.underline}**. 12

[Thus, we argue that digital biosecurity]{.underline}---the effective
[prevention or mitigation of current and emerging risks at the
intersection of computational systems and biological
information]{.underline}---[is increasingly important and
necessary]{.underline}. **[Given that several countries that are
currently strategically competitive with the US and its allies are
dedicating effort(s), resources and funding to neuro- and cyber-S/T
research and capabilities]{.underline}**, **[there is increasing
likelihood of attempts to engage neurodata for leverageable
informational, social, legal, and military power
advantage(s)]{.underline}**.

[Therefore, we posit that an integrative approach to digital biosecurity
is required that can effectively and efficiently address present and
future challenges]{.underline}. The integration must occur in the
domains and dimensions that are most relevant and crucial to
surveillance, oversight, and direction of neurocognitive and other types
of biodata. [Such an approach would necessitate]{.underline}: (1) [an
integrative scientific convergent paradigm]{.underline}; (2) at least a
whole-of-government, if not [whole-of-nation dedication]{.underline}13;
[and]{.underline} (3) [a multi-national re-address to more effectively
guide and govern the ways that neurodata]{.underline}---[and other
bioinformation]{.underline}---[are and can be used in both non-kinetic
and kinetic engagements]{.underline}14.

#### Precision pathogens risk mass death on the level of nuclear annihilation 

Amy **Webb '22**, is the founder of the Future Today Institute and a
professor of strategic foresight at New York University's Stern School
of Business, "THE NEXT PANDEMIC COULD START WITH A TERRORIST ATTACK",
The Atlantic, 2/14/22,
https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/02/pandemic-terrorist-attack-biowarfare/622067/

[We've just lived through a global pandemic that no one wants to see
replicated]{.underline}. We may have COVID-19 vaccines, but **[the path
to endemicity is bumpy and will entail incalculable death and
morbidity]{.underline}**. [Before we can even hope to eradicate
SARS-CoV-2]{.underline}, as we eventually did with smallpox, [there will
be more mutations and many new strains]{.underline}. Some could affect
the body in ways we've not yet seen or even imagined. **[We will
continue to live with tremendous uncertainty over how and when the virus
will further mutate]{.underline}**.

Obviously, one would hope that virus research would be undertaken in a
lab where fanatical adherence to safety and rigorous oversight policies
were strictly enforced. Just before the WHO declared smallpox
eradicated, a photographer named Janet Parker was working at a medical
school in Birmingham, England. She developed a fever and body aches,
and, a few days later, a red rash. At the time, she thought it was
chicken pox. (That vaccine had not yet been developed.) The tiny,
pimple-like dots she'd been expecting, however, developed into much
bigger lesions, and they were full of a yellowish, milky fluid. As her
condition worsened, doctors determined that she'd contracted smallpox,
almost certainly from a sloppily managed high-security research lab
inside the same building where she worked.

Parker, sadly, is now remembered as the last person known to have died
from smallpox. [Does the benefit of being able to accurately predict
virus mutations outweigh the public risks of gain-of-function
research]{.underline} ([that is, research that involves intentionally
mutating viruses to make them stronger, more transmissible, and more
dangerous]{.underline})? It depends on whom you ask.

Or, rather, which agency you ask. The NIH issued a series of biosafety
guidelines for research on H5N1 and other flu viruses in 2013, but the
guidelines were narrow and didn't cover other kinds of viruses. The
White House Office of Science and Technology Policy announced a new
process to assess the risks and benefits of gain-of-function experiments
in 2014. It included influenza along with the MERS and SARS viruses. But
that new policy also halted existing studies intended to develop flu
vaccines. So the government reversed course in 2017, when the National
Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity determined that such research
wouldn't pose a risk to public safety. In 2019, the U.S. government said
that it had resumed funding for---wait for it---a new round of
gain-of-function experiments intended to make the H5N1 bird flu more
transmissible again.

Meanwhile, **[this back-and-forth doesn't stop bad actors from gaining
access to open-source research papers and mail-order genetic
material]{.underline}**. **[When it comes to synthetic biology, security
experts are particularly concerned about future dual-use
issues]{.underline}**. **[Traditional force
protection]{.underline}**---the security strategies to keep populations
safe---**[won't work against an adversary that has adapted gene products
or designer molecules to use as bioweapons]{.underline}**.

In an August 2020 paper published in the academic journal CTC Sentinel,
which focuses on contemporary terrorism threats, Ken Wickiser, a
biochemist and the associate dean of research at West Point, wrote:
"**[As molecular engineering techniques of the synthetic biologists
become more robust and widespread, the probability of encountering one
or more of these threats is approaching certainty]{.underline}** ...
**[The change to the threat landscape created by these techniques is
rivaled only by the development of the atomic bomb]{.underline}**."

#### Genetic warfare leads to extinction -- outweighs nuclear war both on magnitude and timeframe

**[International Politics of Genetic Warfare]{.underline}** Just one
week [after]{.underline} the [September 11]{.underline} attacks,
[letters laced with anthrax began arriving at media and congressional
offices. Coupled with the earlier revelations about the magnitude of the
Soviet and Iraqi biowarfare programs]{.underline}, [biological weapons
came to be viewed as "one of the **key security issues** of the
twenty-first century."]{.underline}82 Two decades later, [the specter of
biowarfare reemerged. With]{.underline} the [COVID]{.underline}-19
[pandemic]{.underline} came the fear that ["the **invisible enemy** can
hide within our ranks, **multiplying in secret**, planting **time
bombs** in our bodies, and all before we know what's hit
us."]{.underline}83 The [fear of secret genetic weapons capability and
use is not limited to **malicious non-state actors**]{.underline}. In
what has been characterized as a sign of "a new Cold War," a [Chinese
foreign ministry spokesman suggested in March 2020 that the US Army may
have brought COVID-19]{.underline} to Wuhan.84 [The US secretary of
state responded in kind by alleging that the outbreak originated in a
Chinese laboratory]{.underline}.85 All the while, [conspiracy
theories]{.underline} about the origins of the disease [spread on online
platforms]{.underline}. Among them were the claims that the virus was
part of China's "covert biological weapons program" and that a
Canadian-Chinese spy team sent the virus to Wuhan.86 [Such
**undiplomatic exchanges** and **conspiratorial claims** are
particularly **hazardous** in the era of **global competition** among
great powers]{.underline}.87 [Biological weapons have always been more
accessible than nuclear ones.]{.underline} However, [with genetic
engineering increasingly solving the problems of **weaponization**,
**delivery**, and **precision**]{.underline}, Ebola expert Karl Johnson
predicts that "[any]{.underline} ~~crackpot~~ individual [with a few
thousand dollars' worth of equipment and a college biology education
under]{.underline} ~~his~~ \[[their]{.underline}\] [belt could
**manufacture** bugs that would make Ebola look like a walk around the
park."]{.underline}88 [Predictions about genetic warfare]{.underline}
would [benefit from]{.underline} identifying the [closest parallels
and]{.underline} then [adjusting and synthesizing the ensuing
models.]{.underline} **[Genetic weapons have the destructive potential
of nuclear weapons, but their ease of development is akin to cyber
weapons]{.underline}**. Both genetic and cyber warfare [require
inexpensive equipment and only a college-level understanding of these
fields]{.underline}. Unlike nuclear weapons that demand enormous
engineering expertise[, a small team can develop and hone cyber and
genetic weapons using common equipment.]{.underline}89 **[Dual-use
capability]{.underline}** is [another similarity. Unlike nuclear and
chemical weapons, **genetically engineered bioweapons** do not require
**equipment** or **materials** exclusively tailored to their
purpose]{.underline}. This concern was among the first raised in the US
National Security Strategy in 2017.90 As one military analyst stated, "A
nuclear weapons facility has obvious signals to the outside world. We
can look at it and immediately say, 'Ugh, that is a nuclear reactor.
However, the [technology for conducting biological weapons research is
essentially the same as \[for\] what keeps a population
healthy]{.underline}."91 Many [biological engineering
techniques]{.underline} with dual-use potential are holy grails of
medicine. [Research journals publish]{.underline} techniques and results
[inter-nationally, publicly, and without consideration for their
security implications]{.underline}.92 [Dissemination]{.underline} of
this information [limits]{.underline} the [effectiveness of the
**Biological Weapons Convention** (BWC) and **domestic control
regimes**]{.underline}.93 Biological weapons [programs]{.underline} are
far [more challenging to detect than nuclear programs]{.underline}. They
look like other biological research programs. [The body charged with
**enforcing compliance**]{.underline} with the BWC, [the Implementation
Support Unit]{.underline}, is [significantly **underfunded** compared to
the enforcement arms of the Chemical Weapons Convention and
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons agreements]{.underline}. Much like
for cyber weapons, [custom bioweapon development is effectively
unregulated.]{.underline}94 [Genetic and cyber weapons]{.underline} are
also [similar in their strategic utility in terms of **versatility**,
**durability**, and **deniability**]{.underline}. The scope and
specificity of genetic weapons make them more analogous to cyber than
any of the traditional weapons of mass destruction. [Genetically
engineered bioagents]{.underline} can [achieve levels of specificity
that were previously impossible using traditional pathogens. Targets can
include **ethnic groups** and even specific individuals. They need not
even be human: **tailored pathogens** can affect **rubber**,
**plastics**, and other **defense** and **infrastructure-related
materials**.]{.underline}95 Similarly, cyberweapons can attack power
grids and other nonhuman targets. Versatility, or the capacity to take
on different forms of varying lethality against varied targets, makes
genetic weapons potentially even more hazardous than nuclear weapons.
Finally, unlike nuclear, but similar to cyber, [genetic weapons can be
used **covertly**]{.underline}. Thus, those who employ them have
plausible deniability. Much like North Korea proxies' use of ransomware
or Russia's disinformation campaigns, a genetic weapon would be
difficult to attribute. Even chemical weapons do not have this
advantage. [Attempts to deny their use, such as in Ghouta, Syria,
typically fail miserably upon investigation.96 **The** **ease of
development** and **strategic benefits** of genetic weapons make them,
as one forecaster put it, "the **most dangerous threat** humanity has
ever faced]{.underline}."97 What would states and non-state actors do
once they acquired them? Would they keep their genetic war capability
secret? Would they use genetic weapons openly or covertly? These
questions are considered next. Genetic War Capability: Reveal or
Conceal? Underlying the question of whether to reveal or conceal genetic
military capability is a trade-off. To conceal it is to gain a potent
secret edge over rivals. To reveal it is to deter or frighten others
from attacking.98 20 STRATEGIC STUDIES QUARTERLY → FALL 2021 Yelena
Biberman Deterrence works "because the expected reaction of the attacked
will result in one's own severe punishment."99 It is "the power to
dissuade."100 [Two factors determine whether actors reveal their
clandestine capability,]{.underline} according to Brendan Rittenhouse
Green and Austin Long.101 The [first is the uniqueness of the
capability---the less unique, the less attractive is concealing relative
to revealing]{.underline}. The second is the prospect that the adversary
will implement countermeasures. [Successful countermeasures can sharply
degrade a weapon's military value.]{.underline}102 The lower the odds of
countermeasures, the more likely the actors are to reveal their
clandestine capability. The decision to reveal one's clandestine
capability ultimately depends on one's need for deterrence. Traditional
biological weapons could not deter because their outcome was always
uncertain. However, [without the problems of **weaponizability**,
**delivery**, and **precision** plaguing them, **genetic weapons** could
deter even countries with **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. The
destructive outcome of genetic weapons may be assured, immediate, and
massive. A genetically engineered bioagent with a short incubation
period could be released as instantly as a nuclear agent on a population
of millions.103 And, [unlike nuclear weapons]{.underline}, which rely on
city and civilian attacks, [an attack by a **genetic weapon** is more
likely to be **militarily decisive**]{.underline}---that is, to
[**influence leaders'** decisions about war and surrender]{.underline}.
Its [effects could **inflict** **harm** not only on **civilians** but
also on the **leaders** themselves]{.underline}.104 All of these factors
make genetic weapons potentially more potent than nuclear weapons as a
mechanism of deterrence. Accordingly, [state and non-state actors that
need to demonstrate credible deterrence are most likely to reveal their
genetic war capability]{.underline}. These actors lack the only other
rivaling source of deterrence---nuclear weapons. Because they may be
threatened or greedy, they are "willing to incur costs or risks for
non-security expansion."105 Nuclear states are the actors most disposed
to conceal genetic war capability. They can reap the strategic benefits
of hidden genetic power without worrying about survival-threatening
aggression or retaliation. Do the effects of genetic weapons need to be
demonstrated for them to have a deterrence outcome similar to nuclear
weapons? It may be that recent outbreaks, such as Ebola or COVID-19,
provide the element of proof needed to convince a population and its
political representatives of the credibility of the threat. The recent
experience with outbreaks may instill, at least in the current
generations, strong aversion and even fear. [The collective memory of
the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and even the Cold
War--era duck-and-cover drills, has faded]{.underline}. However, the
[memory of the COVID-19 pandemic]{.underline} is fresh and potent,
especially for the generation that came of age during the pandemic.106
[What makes genetic weapons unique is their **combination of
accessibility** and **destructive potential**.]{.underline} Nuclear
deterrence requires some evidence that an actor is capable of creating
and delivering a nuclear weapon. However, [with genetic
weapons]{.underline}---including those [the Imperiale Framework has
deemed most urgent and concerning]{.underline}---no evidence of
capability is necessary. Of itself, [the accessibility of relevant
technologies]{.underline} and knowhow can [portend a
threat]{.underline}. A [mere statement of]{.underline} one's willingness
to use [genetic weapons, combined with some signals of credibility of
intention, may be enough to **deter others** from an
attack]{.underline}. This possibility may be a dream for structural
realists like Kenneth Waltz, if not for the accessibility of genetic
weapons to states and non-state actors alike.107

[The US National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine has
identified the need for the US and its allies to recognize dual
obligations to the emerging bioeconomy]{.underline}. [First is a
responsibility for prudent direction and oversight, as failure to
promote progress in/by biological and technological industries could
result in losing leadership of the international community]{.underline}.
Meeting this obligation could [include adequately funding research and
development in key areas, implementing appropriate research oversight,
and educating the research workforce]{.underline}. [Second is the need
to protect the bioeconomy from deliberate adversarial acts that could
impede biotechnological progress and allow other international
individuals, groups, or countries to gain power advantage]{.underline}.
[Engaging this responsibility could entail developing more rigorous
methods of proper handling and oversight of biologicals and/or
technology, affording ample protection of biological data and digital
infrastructures, and the development and implementation of]{.underline}
(more effective, and globally relevant and responsive) [intellectual
property laws]{.underline}.

Additionally, **[it is important to note that although the US National
Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report briefly mentioned
recent developments in brain-controlled robotics and brainmachine
interface (BMI), neuroS/T, writ large, was not a core aspect of their
address]{.underline}**. At present, a majority of countries do not yet
identify the brain sciences as a principal economic focus. Of the 41
nations that pursued specific political strategies to expand and promote
their bioeconomies in 2018, only 10 included neuroS/T research and
development objectives.16 [So, while there may be little doubt that
neuropsychiatric disorders are a significant public health problem,
brain research is relatively costly, and the perceived
return-on-investment for those countries that do not have substantial
neuroepidemiological burdens may not be sufficient to justify pursuing
dedicated neuroS/T initiatives]{.underline}. **[However, while
intranational human capital and socio-political agendas of a given
nation may not prompt investment and engagement in neuro-bioeconomics,
the relative economic]{.underline}**---and perhaps cultural and
political---**[hegemony afforded by leveraging global
neuroS/T]{.underline}** (**[and overall biological]{.underline}**)
**[markets might prove influential to changing perspectives, postures,
and participation]{.underline}**. To be sure, **[due to the current lack
of emphasis on brain science in national bioeconomic strategies, those
countries that initiate policies and programs to invest in neuroS/T may
achieve significant financial successes and economic power, and thereby
direct future]{.underline}** (ethical, technical, and legal)
**[standards of research and use]{.underline}**.

**[This power can be engaged in kinetic and non-kinetic operations, as
evidenced by multinational interest and effort in brain science in
military and intelligence agendas]{.underline}**. **[Notable in this
regard is that current treaties]{.underline}** (e.g., the BTWC and CWC)
**[do not specifically address neurotechnologies and
neuroinformatics]{.underline}**.

Furthermore, several aspects of the brain sciences make them
particularly problematic for the biosecurity community. First, the field
has become increasingly interdisciplinary and strives to integrate
several sciences and technologies (e.g., biology, chemistry, psychology,
physics, computational sciences) to address neuroscientific questions
and forge innovative discoveries and interventions. For instance, state
and non-state actors can use novel neurotechnologies (e.g., BMIs and
transcranial neural stimulation devices) and advances in
neuroinformatics (i.e., analyzing neuroscientific data to better assess,
access, and affect the nervous system) for WINS applications. At
present, **[the development and use of these devices are underregulated
and not included in dual-use export safeguards, thus making effective
oversight of potential dual-use research of concern]{.underline}**
(DURC) **[difficult]{.underline}**. Second, [these neurotechnologies are
as yet underexplored for their augmentative and destructive capabilities
and uses. In contrast to other conventional biological and chemical
weapons]{.underline} (e.g., microbes, toxins, chemicals), [devices that
affect the nervous system are relatively new and have only recently been
engaged for their WINS potential]{.underline}. **[This combination of
"blank slate" and "unknown ground" dimensions of neurotechnology creates
difficulties in realistic biosecurity forecasting and
preparedness]{.underline}**.

For the last two decades, [publications in the brain sciences have
steadily increased]{.underline}. [Yet, for the aforementioned reasons
oversight remains a problem, as surveillance of potential WINS
applications is complexified by persistent challenges in tracking and
evaluating]{.underline} (any) [neuroS/T research and product
development]{.underline}. **[Thus, the potential for dual- or direct-use
of neuroS/T for disruptive or destructive purposes becomes increasingly
viable]{.underline}**.

Moreover, as previously stated, **[much of neuroS/T is reliant upon and
force multiplied by big data and computational
approaches]{.underline}**. In this light it is important to note that
the rapidity of advances in cybertechnology and data analytics often
outpaces securitization. [The term "cyberbiosecurity" has been proposed
to describe the intersection of computational systems, biological
information, and the processes required to effectively mitigate and/or
prevent new and emerging risks and threats]{.underline}.

Clearly, **[brain science has become a multinational
enterprise]{.underline}**. And as previously noted, although some
nations have not committed investments and resources to escalate
neuroS/T initiatives, others most certainly have, and with ardent
intent. Therefore, **[it is important to note]{.underline}** (1) **[the
distinct influence(s) that neuroS/T capabilities can exert within and
between developed, developing, and non-developed nations;
and]{.underline}** (2) **[the differing cultural and political values
that can affect the ethical codes that guide and govern the conduct of
scientific research]{.underline}**. Taken together, **[these
asymmetries]{.underline}** (**[in capability and ethical
standards]{.underline}**) **[can]{.underline}**---**[and]{.underline}**
often **[do]{.underline}**---**[create opportunistic windows that can
expedite neuroS/T research and advance outcomes and products to
ultimately affect international markets and global balances of
power]{.underline}**. **[Key examples of such exercise in capability
include recent neuroS/T endeavors in/by China and Russia]{.underline}**
(Chen, et al., 2018; Giordano, et al., 2019; Giordano, 2017).

#### Scenario 2 is REMS --

#### The US and NATO are facing [severe]{.underline} supply chain bottlenecks in REMs due to Chinese and Russian control of resources -- renewed focus on solutions by the alliance is key to avoid getting cut off -- US lead is [crucial]{.underline}

As it stands, **[Chinese domination of the critical mineral supply
chains dwarves the U.S. by all conceivable metrics: China commands 85%
of the REE export market, producing 62% of global raw mineral materials
and importing \$2 billion worth of critical minerals and
REEs]{.underline}**. **[In the event of an acute international crisis,
the PRC would likely use its leverage to further geostrategic aims by
imposing critical mineral embargos]{.underline}**. **[Considering the
United States derives roughly 80% of its REEs from China, these would
likely be catastrophic for the economy, including the high tech,
computers, electronics, electric mobility, aerospace, and
military-industrial complex]{.underline}**.

[Given China's track record and threats in this space, the potential for
future embargos is realistic]{.underline}. Like the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve (SPR), **[the stockpiling of rare earths and critical minerals
would provide sustainability in the face of international
crisis]{.underline}**. Supply delays during the COVID-19 pandemic
exposed the U.S. lack of preparedness and supply chain bottlenecks,
which is beginning to have short-term ramifications for U.S.
semiconductors, appliances, autos, and other industries. Current
semiconductor shortages in car and appliances factories are threatening
to interrupt production and are leading to wait periods of up to
six-month delivery times.

[In the event of a critical minerals embargo, U.S. companies would be
left stranded with limited REE stockpile capabilities]{.underline}.
**[To]{.underline}** **[counter the strategic vulnerabilities associated
with reliance on Chinese critical mineral and REE supply chains, the
United States must immediately establish a reserve of critical minerals
like that of the SPR for oil imports]{.underline}**. The capacity of
such a reserve is open to discussion, but one third-to-half of annual
REE demand seems appropriate at the first stage, later expanding the
reserve to a whole year of supply.

[Developing domestic capacities to mine and refine critical minerals
across the United States should be a priority for the U.S. government
agencies, yet the private sector should be the primary driver behind REE
exploration and production, like other mineral mining and
processing]{.underline}. The sole Mountain Pass mine in California will
not be sufficient for long-term aims of decoupling from Chinese critical
mineral supply. Plans made by Lynas and Blue Line Corp to build domestic
REE refinement facilities in the United States should be the pioneering
projects, leading to bigger and better ones throughout North America.
The Biden administration should also reauthorize the Defense Production
Act to speed up the planning, construction, and operation of these
facilities, as expanding domestic mineral projects addresses a key
strategic vulnerability.

U.S. corporations should be encouraged to expand rare earths extraction
operations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The construction of
mining infrastructure in African nations would be relatively
inexpensive, given lower labor costs and less stringent environmental
regulations. Africa's rich mineral reserves make it an ideal destination
for supply chain diversification. However, the security challenges, from
Al Shabaab to Boko Haram will require U.S. and its allies to project
power in order to protect the supply chain. Importantly, the African
governments and audiences should be aware of U.S. efforts to address
developmental needs of host countries, regions, and communities---in
competition with China. Roads, schools, medical facilities, and
environmental protection should be front and center for U.S. REE
operations in Africa.

Finally, [U.S. policymakers must set specific targets to decrease
reliance on Chinese REEs and critical minerals]{.underline}. Targeting
specific non-China reliance goals will increase intergovernmental and
business sector cooperation and signal clear intent to international
partners to build robust levels of Western REE self-reliance.

**[The United States and its allies should pursue policies that
guarantee dependable access to these critical resources at affordable
prices]{.underline}**, like those in response to the 1970s Arab
embargo-triggered energy crisis. President Richard Nixon launched
Project Independence after the 1973 oil embargo, attempting to ensure
that the U.S. would increase its capacity to refine and extract oil
domestically while promoting a union of consumer countries to study the
industry and influence oil pricing. The International Energy Agency
arose from such cooperative efforts of oil-consuming democracies.
Similarly, **[the U.S. must now explore critical mineral supply
expansion while gathering allies into an REE "consumer club" to develop
policies and build strategic cooperation and partnerships in the
diversification of extraction and refinement facilities]{.underline}**.

**[Critical minerals are the lifeblood of the 21st century, fueling
high-tech manufacturing and renewable energy transition]{.underline}**.
**[These resources are the keystones of economic progress and industrial
leadership in building 21st century defenses]{.underline}**. **[The U.S.
and]{.underline}** ~~her~~ **[allies must diversify their critical
mineral supply chains]{.underline}**. **[Governments who underestimate
their importance do so at their own risk]{.underline}**.

It is the year 2030 and as projected nearly two decades ago, [China has
risen to be not only a hegemon in the Asia-Pacific region but also a
nation capable of **significant power projection** outside of its normal
sphere of influence]{.underline}. [China's military has grown in size
and capability to a point where it is at near parity with the United
States]{.underline}. [Confrontations between competing claimants in the
South China Sea have increased considerably]{.underline} over the years
due to the exploration and now production of both oil and natural gas
resources within the area. Additionally, the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations ([ASEAN) and China were never able to negotiate a final
agreement on a code of conduct]{.underline} for operations in the South
China Sea, with China preferring a bilateral approach to the issue in
order to exert its power more decisively against smaller states.
[These]{.underline} events [have culminated in a crisis in the South
China Sea]{.underline} between the Philippines and China over competing
claims to the Scarborough Shoal. [Repeated Chinese bullying via
harassing naval operations]{.underline} against both Philippine
commercial and military vessels [has prompted]{.underline} the
Philippines to seek assistance from [the United States]{.underline}
based on the mutual defense agreement between the two nations. At this
point, [the United States and China are poised for a]{.underline}
possible [**military confrontation in the South China Sea.**
This]{.underline} hypothetical scenario hopefully will never come to
fruition; however, it [is not inconceivable]{.underline}. In fact,
[many]{.underline} would [argue it is **very plausible**]{.underline}
[based on]{.underline} present day [Chinese military expenditures, a
lack of transparency of Chinese intentions, and ongoing territorial
disputes in the South China Sea.]{.underline} [The]{.underline} above
[scenario could be used as a backdrop for a **multitude
of**]{.underline} potential **[security issues between the United States
and China]{.underline}**. This article, however, will [focus on the
single issue of China's monopoly]{.underline} on the production of rare
earth elements [and]{.underline} the pursuant [implications to U.S.
national security.]{.underline} Currently, [China produces nearly 95
percent of]{.underline} the global supply of [rare earth
elements]{.underline}.1 [These elements are **critical resources** in
the manufacturing of]{.underline} both commercial and [military
goods]{.underline}. [Precision guided munitions, engine coatings for
fighter aircraft, and ship-building components]{.underline} are just a
few examples of defense weapons systems that [require rare
earths]{.underline}.2 [For a nation to rely on a near sole producer of a
vital resource is imprudent]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} point [is
especially]{.underline} [concerning]{.underline} when put
[in]{.underline}to [a contextual framework vis-à-vis the United States
and China]{.underline}. Can the United States afford to remain dependent
on a potential adversary for a resource that has direct implications on
the outcome of a military confrontation? Can the United States find
viable alternatives from either within its borders or from more reliable
partners in the global community? Finally, what are the costs with
regards to national security? In order to answer these questions and
develop a deeper understanding of the rare earths challenge from a
security context, this article will first define rare earth elements,
including where they are found, how they are mined and processed into
the end-use product, and who currently has the capacity to produce these
elements. Next, the article will examine China's monopoly of the
industry as well as China's export policies. The 2010 crisis between
China and Japan over territorial claims to the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands
illustrates the control China exercises over importing nations who rely
on Chinese rare earth elements for commercial manufacturing, and serves
as an example of potential adverse effects of not finding an alternative
source. Finally, this piece will scrutinize four potential solutions to
release China's stranglehold on the production of rare earths. RARE
EARTH ELEMENTS The elements known as rare earths are a series of fifteen
elements residing within the periodic table and having an atomic number
ranging from fifty-seven to seventy-one.3 The elements are commonly
known as the lanthanides and include lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium,
neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium,
dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium.4 Yttrium
and scandium are also considered rare earth elements due to their
similar chemical and physical properties with the lanthanides.5 The term
"rare" is somewhat of a misnomer. The lanthanides are not so much as
rare in abundance as they are seldom found in large quantities
together.6 This fact makes mining for the elements more difficult and
therefore costly with respect to return on investment. Cerium is the
most abundant rare earth and is actually more common than copper or lead
in the Earth's crust.7 With the exception of promethium, all of the rare
earths are more prominent than silver or mercury.8 As an example, most
rare earths range from 150 to 220 parts per million in the crust versus
the more commercially mined elements such as copper (fifty-five parts
per million) and zinc (seventy parts per million).9 In order to mine and
produce rare earth elements, geologists must first locate a base mineral
with known rare earth elements-bearing capacity in a commercially viable
quantity. Furthermore, it is advantageous to find rare earth
elements-bearing minerals in their lowest phase. A phase is defined as
having distinct physical and chemical attributes that can be physically
separated from a system.10 Minerals that have multiple phases require
more complex separation techniques thus increasing the cost of
production.11 Therefore, minerals consisting of a single phase provide
the most cost effective means for producing rare earth elements.12 With
regards to mining rare earths, bastnasite and monazite are single phase
minerals found in the most abundant quantities.13 A significant downside
to monazite, however, is its tendency to contain the radioactive element
thorium, which encumbers additional environmental protection and health
safety issues.14 Once the base ore is discovered in sufficient quantity,
the ore is extracted and then processed into rare earth oxides (REO).
The process for separating the ore into a REO is complex, requiring the
use of acid solutions to dissolve the rare earth ions followed by
further processing to separate the rare earths into both heavy and light
oxides.15 REOs are the key element for the production of specific
metals, which are in turn manufactured into a number of commercial and
defense products. As previously explained, rare earths exist throughout
the planet. However, there are currently only limited locations where
the mining and production of rare earths occur. The largest rare earths
mines are in China and account for almost 95 percent of the planet's
production. The Bayan Obo mine in southern China and the Mountain Pass
mine in California are the largest known single phase mineral deposits
of bastnasite.16 Proven reserves also exist in Australia, Brazil,
Russia, India, Malaysia, and the United States, while other nations
account for approximately twenty percent of the remaining reserves.17
Currently, the only manufacturers of rare earth elements are China,
India, Brazil, and Malaysia, in descending order of production.18 The
United States and Australia are in the process of restarting and
developing the production of rare earth elements.19 This article will
later cover in more detail China's current monopoly and the potential
growth of the industry outside of China. USES OF RARE EARTH ELEMENTS
[The concern over access to a secure and reliable supply of rare earths
stems]{.underline} [from the]{.underline} ubiquitous [nature
of]{.underline} the commercial and [defense sector products]{.underline}
made from these elements. These products range from touch screens for
iPhones to guidance components on advanced air-to-air missiles. Without
a sufficient supply of rare earths, numerous everyday products would no
longer be available to the American consumer. More importantly,
[essential components in U.S. weapons systems would be]{.underline}
difficult if not [**impossible to produce** without them]{.underline}.
Rare earths are important in the manufacture of a myriad of products due
to their unique ability to readily give up and accept electrons.20 This
property makes them beneficial in many electronic, optical, magnetic,
and catalytic applications.21 Permanent magnets and rare earth phosphors
are the most prevalent of the rare earths--based products in today's
market. Permanent magnets incorporate neodymium, praseodymium,
dysprosium, and terbium as key elements.22 Rare earth phosphors use
yttrium, europium, terbium, gadolinium, and cerium, which contribute to
the brilliant display of colors on flat panel television screens.23
Additionally, rare earths also aid in fiber optic signal amplification
through the incorporation of yttrium, europium, terbium, and erbium.24
Nickel metal hydride batteries use lanthanum to increase energy storage
capacity.25 Finally, catalytic crackers and convertors employ cerium and
lanthanum.26 Many rare earth products and technologies possess dual-use
attributes, meaning they are used for both commercial and military
purposes. In the commercial sector, for example, today's hybrid vehicles
employ rare earths permanent magnets in their electric traction
drives,27 which either replace or supplement internal combustion engines
in hybrid automobiles, increasing energy efficiency.28 Additionally, the
Toyota Prius has a nickel metal hydride (Ni-MH) battery for energy
storage, which increases overall fuel economy.29 Wind turbines also
integrate permanent magnets in gearless generators for better
reliability and online performance.30 The new fluorescent light bulbs on
the market utilize rare earth phosphors. These light bulbs consume 70
percent less energy than the older incandescent bulbs.31 Finally, rare
earths are found in automobile catalytic convertors to reduce dangerous
emissions of CO2 and ozone, contributing to a cleaner environment.32
Furthermore, dual-use components made from rare earths play a vital role
in U.S. national security through defense sector applications.
[Permanent magnets are incorporated in critical guidance and control
mechanisms of U.S.-built weapons,]{.underline} [enabling kinetic weapons
to impact their target]{.underline}.33 Today's [advanced jet engines are
coated with rare earth elements]{.underline} for increased thermal
stress resistance.34 The performance requirements for the engines on the
F-22A Raptor and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) are extremely stringent
based on the environment in which these aircraft routinely operate.
[Without the added thermal protection rare earths provide, engine
performance may be degraded with **catastrophic results**]{.underline}.
Rare earths technology used in electronics also has numerous defense
applications. [The same technology]{.underline} used in manufacturing
commercial Ni-MH batteries [is]{.underline} also [found in]{.underline}
both [electronic warfare systems and directed energy
weapons]{.underline}.35 [Examples of their use include smart jammers on
advanced U.S. fighter aircraft, area denial weapons systems, and the
electromagnetic railgun]{.underline}.36 All of these weapons require
high efficiency battery technology to function properly. Additionally,
[computer drives manufactured with critical rare earths enable precision
weapons systems to reach their targets, while laser technology depends
on the amplification properties of rare earths for targeting.37 Without
these critical components, accuracy would deteriorate,]{.underline}
potentially resulting in increased collateral damage and weapons
expenditure. CHINA'S HOLD ON RARE EARTHS China has not always been the
leader in the mining and production of rare earth elements. Only since
the mid-1980s has China become the predominant producer on the global
market. Before that time, the United States was the world's largest
supplier of rare earths. [The decline of U.S. rare earth mining
coincided with China's growth, which has contributed to China's
stranglehold on the trade]{.underline}. [China's appetite for internal
consumption of rare earths has]{.underline} also [increased]{.underline}
due to its booming economy, [which]{.underline} is starting to [affect
availability]{.underline}. With 95 percent of the world's production
capacity in China, rare earths are simply not readily available outside
of the Chinese market. The reason for the decline in the U.S. industry
was due in part to lower labor costs in China, combined with
environmental issues at the Mountain Pass mine, the largest source of
U.S. rare earths during this period.38 The latter issue was over a main
wastewater pipeline that did not meet regulatory and environmental
standards under U.S. law, leading to a shutdown of the mine.39 Since
that time, a small amount of rare earths has been produced from
bastnasite stockpiles that existed prior to the closure.40 Molycorp
reopened the Mountain Pass mine in 2011, and its potential impact on the
rare earths industry will be discussed later. China's ability to provide
low cost labor significantly contributed to its rise to the top of the
industry. Lower labor costs allowed China to produce rare earths at a
more competitive price than other, smaller producers around the world,
thus making it economically unattractive for those producers to stay in
the market or for new producers to enter. Second, China's low
environmental standards played a role in its emergence as the world's
leader in rare earths production.41 It certainly helped that China was
more concerned during this rise with fueling its growing economy than
addressing environmental concerns pertaining to rare earths production.
A third contributor to China's rise is its access to large deposits of
ores within its borders. The majority of China's rare earths are
produced at the Bayan Obo mine in northeast China and at a number of
mines in southern China and Sichuan.42 These mines have significant
deposits of bastnasite.43 The Bayan Obo mine provides 50 percent of the
rare earths mining production for China's industry, while the mines in
southern China and Sichuan account for 41 percent and 9 percent of
production respectively.44 [The demand for rare earths continues to
rise]{.underline}. [In 2010, the worldwide demand for rare earth oxides
was 127,500]{.underline} metric [tons]{.underline}.45 [China
produced]{.underline} over [130,000]{.underline} metric
[tons]{.underline} of rare earths in 2010 and 2011, eclipsing world
demand.46 [The next largest producer was India with a paltry
3,000]{.underline} metric [tons]{.underline}, followed by Brazil at 550
metric tons, and Malaysia at thirty metric tons.47 [These production
rates exemplify the disparity between China and its closest
competitors]{.underline} in the industry. By 2014, [it is estimated that
total demand for rare earth oxides will reach 177,200 metric
tons]{.underline}.48 [This increase equates to a 75 percent growth in
demand]{.underline} for battery alloy production and a 57 percent growth
in demand for permanent magnets.49 Capacity for meeting the increased
demand is uncertain. Of the world's estimated 110,000,000 metric tons of
reserves, China controls half.50 The Commonwealth of Independent States
is second, controlling approximately 19,000,000 metric tons, with the
U.S. in third at 13,000,000 metric tons.51 Despite the large number of
reserves deposited across the planet, very few countries possess the
capacity to mine the ores and process them into rare earth oxides.
However, with increasing demand on the horizon accompanied by increasing
value, more nations as well as private corporations may be willing to
enter the market. [With a firm hold over the industry, **China clearly
has the upper hand with regards to controlling both supply and overall
pricing**]{.underline} of rare earths. The price for rare earth elements
has risen exponentially over the past several years due to both
increased demand for rare earths products and a limited supply chain.
For example, lanthanum sold for \$3.44 per kilogram in 2007 but, by the
third quarter of 2011, was selling for \$153 per kilogram.52 That is a
forty-four-fold increase in just under four years. Other rare earths
have seen similar price spikes over the same period. Neodymium, which is
a key ingredient in the manufacturing of permanent magnets, sold for
\$30.24 per kilogram in 2007 and, in July 2011, hovered near \$340 per
kilogram.53 As of April 2013, the market prices for lanthanum and
neodymium declined and are approximately \$11 and \$75 per kilogram
respectfully.54 The decrease in price is welcome news for manufacturers
and is attributed mostly to lower demand for rare earths due to recent
high prices. There are several reasons for the skyrocketing rare earths
prices from 2007 to 2011, and they all stem from policy decisions within
China. These [policy decisions resulted in a decrease in supply of rare
earths to the outside world]{.underline}. [One]{.underline} such
[policy]{.underline} decision [was China's deliberate move to address
environmental issues within the mining industry]{.underline}. According
to a 2011 New York Times article, Chinese officials were concerned with
polluted water, air, and radioactive residues from the rare earths
industry.55 Most of China's rare earths facilities closed during the
fall of 2011 in order to install pollution control equipment.56 Another
policy decision addressed the overwhelming number of mine operators
operating illegally without a license. These operators conducted
business without any concern for the environment or labor practices.57
China's solution for these issues is to consolidate the mining industry
into larger enterprises under government control. For example, in
northern China a single, government-controlled monopoly named Bao Gang
Rare Earth was formed incorporating thirtyone mostly private rare earths
processing companies.58 The same consolidation process is occurring in
southern China, where the government has created three distinct
companies en route to consolidating 80 percent of production in the
region.59 The combination of stricter adherence to environmental
regulations and government consolidation of the industry equates to an
increase in prices. A third, more ominous factor is also affecting
overall supply of Chinese rare earths. [China has **deliberately** cut
export quotas for rare earths]{.underline} over the past several years
[due to its own internal appetite for the resource]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} trend [is not likely to change]{.underline} in the
near future. Molycorp's former chief executive officer, Mark Smith,
reported after a trip to China that Chinese officials told him they did
not intend to remain the world's major supplier of rare earths.60
Molycorp also predicts China may be a net importer of rare earths by as
early as 2015.61 This prediction may be a ploy by Molycorp to boost
outside investment or to gain greater attention from Congress; however,
[China's export quotas provide **empirical data** that is hard to
refute.]{.underline} In 2004 and 2005, China exported 65,609 metric tons
of rare earths against a global demand of 90,000 and 98,000
respectively.62 From 2006 through 2009, Chinese exports decreased at a 6
to 7 percent annual rate to 50,145 metric tons in 2009.63 According to a
U.S. Geological Survey report, [China's 2010 rare earth elements export
quota was 37 percent lower than]{.underline} that of [2009]{.underline},
[and a further reduction of 35 percent was designated for
2011]{.underline}.64 Global demand over that period rose to 124,000
metric tons in 2008 with a precipitous drop-off to 85,000 metric tons in
2009 due to the global economic downturn.65 Despite the downturn, demand
climbed back up to 127,500 metric tons in 2010. China's domestic
consumption has risen rapidly over the last ten years from an estimated
19,000 metric tons in 2001 to 77,000 metric tons in 2010.66 The
increased internal demand combined with a somewhat lower production
capacity due to consolidation of the Chinese industry and tougher
enforcement of environmental laws signals that declining export quotas
will remain a Chinese policy for years to come. China's rise to become
the world leader in rare earths production was not by chance. The U.S.
decision to suspend operations at Mountain Pass in the 1990s versus
financing the cleanup and upgrade costs required to meet environmental
regulations was a key contributor. Furthermore, China's own decision to
increase its production capacity through investment in research and
development projects culminated in their monopoly of the rare earths
industry. GEO-STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS [For one nation to possess 95
percent of the production capacity of an increasingly global, vital
natural resource is cause for concern]{.underline}. The fact that [the
nation that controls that resource has not proven to be a transparent
and accountable global partner with regards to territorial claims and
increased military spending **raises**]{.underline} the level of
**[concern significantly]{.underline}**. For these reasons, [China's
monopoly of the rare earths industry presents **national
security**]{.underline} and manufacturing [**concerns** for the United
States and its]{.underline} partners and [allies. It is difficult to
envision the United States or any other nation relying exclusively on a
single supplier for its vital resource needs]{.underline}. [The United
States diversifies its petroleum imports to avoid such a
scenario]{.underline}. Even if the United States were able to import all
of its petroleum requirements from a single, secure, external source,
such as Canada, it would be a dangerous choice due to a number of
factors. For instance, contingencies such as labor strikes, souring
diplomatic relations, and natural disasters make overreliance on one
source a strategic miscalculation. It is therefore wise for nations to
diversify their imports of vital natural resources, using a variety of
suppliers and geographic regions if domestic sources are insufficient or
unavailable. As demonstrated in the hypothetical scenario at the
beginning of this paper, [**China's hold on rare earths may be a
decisive factor in a future confrontation** with the United
States]{.underline}. The [numerous weapons systems that rely on rare
earths technology place the United States at **a strategic disadvantage
with regards to China**]{.underline}. [If]{.underline} a prolonged,
[large-scale conflict]{.underline} between the two nations [broke out
over a Taiwan Strait or South China Sea dispute]{.underline}, [the
United States may find itself squeezed to obtain sufficient supplies of
rare earths to manufacture replacement parts or systems to remain
engaged in the fight]{.underline}. Much as the [lack of secure access to
oil was]{.underline} ~~crippling~~ [devastating to the Germans at the
end of World War II]{.underline}, [rare earths]{.underline} could [play
a similar, **pivotal role in a future conflict with
China**.]{.underline} In the air-to-air arena alone, [the requirement to
replace expended stockpiles of advanced air-to-air missiles could become
a factor very quickly]{.underline} based on the number of aircraft China
would be capable of employing. Japan recently learned that relying on a
single resource supplier was imprudent following an incident between the
Japanese Coast Guard and a Chinese fishing trawler near the Senkaku, or
Diaoyu Islands.67 In September 2010, [a Japanese Coast Guard vessel
attempted to stop a Chinese trawler purported to be fishing illegally in
Japanese waters]{.underline}. During the incident, the captain of the
trawler intentionally rammed the coast guard vessel. Subsequently, the
Japanese Coast Guard apprehended the captain. The ensuing political spat
boiled over for several weeks with the Japanese threatening to try the
captain, while the Chinese suspended high-level contacts with Japan.68
During this period, an unanticipated consequence unfolded. The Chinese
were scheduled to deliver several metric tons of rare earths to Japan
for use in Japanese commercial industries. In what can only be seen as a
direct use of its economic power in a diplomatic tussle, [the Chinese
withheld shipments of the rare earths during the dispute]{.underline}
while awaiting an apology, reparations, and the release of the
captain.69 China denied all accusations that it was purposefully
withholding the shipments as a political bargaining tool against
Japan.70 Whether China purposefully withheld the shipments or not, the
lesson learned by Japan as well as outside observers was that China
possesses a powerful economic instrument to employ against nations that
depend on Chinese rare earths to sustain their economic livelihood.
BREAKING CHINA'S GRIP [The United States cannot remain dependent on
China for its rare earths needs. In order to gain resource independence,
the United States must formulate a plan that will ensure reliable,
secure access to rare earths.]{.underline} Fortunately, this issue has
not been ignored. Currently, Congress has multiple acts addressing the
issue in different stages of approval on the floors of the House of
Representatives and the Senate. These bills recommend exploring options
for stockpiling, recycling, and domestic production of rare earths. This
section will examine all three options, as well as a fourth
incorporating a multi-national course of action. It will conclude by
recommending that the United States develop a program similar to its
approach to building the JSF.71

#### China goes nuclear

**Auslin 6/11** (Michael Auslin, a fellow at Stanford University's
Hoover Institution and the author of Asia's New Geopolitics: Essays on
Reshaping the Indo-Pacific. Foreign Policy, \"The United States Needs to
Relearn Nuclear
Strategy\", 6/11/2022, https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/06/11/us-nuclear-weapons-strategy-putin-ukraine-war-threat-china-arms-race-geopolitics/, accessed

The last serious nuclear crisis was over Cuba in 1962---two entire
generations ago. The 1973 Yom Kippur War, the 1983 Able Archer scare,
and the 1995 Norwegian rocket incident all created mini-emergencies at
most. Throughout the Cold War, nuclear strategists such as Schelling,
Wohlstetter, and Nolan attempted to learn from various crises, fitting
various scenarios into war-gaming and estimation activities. All foreign
policy, especially when it was focused on Europe and Asia, was viewed at
least in part through a nuclear lens, so as not to miscalculate or
underestimate nuclear adversaries. Once the Cold War ended, so did this
sense of urgency. Much of the focus of the post-Cold War nuclear studies
community shifted away from deterrence to disarmament, nonproliferation,
rogue regimes, and the enduring challenge of the North Korean nuclear
program. All were worthy issues, even as the world's other nuclear
powers didn't follow the new U.S. agenda. Yet as tensions continue to
grow between Beijing and Washington and meaningful confidence-building
measures fail to take root, [prudence dictates that the United States'
nuclear experts return to serious thinking about war planning,
escalation ladders, off-ramps, signaling, counterforce targeting,
command and control, and all the rest of the nuclear
enterprise]{.underline}---all [in the context of a variety of
potential]{.underline} scenarios for **[nuclear
escalation]{.underline}**. [The fragility of U.S.-Chinese]{.underline}
political [relations and]{.underline} the [limitations of
meaningful]{.underline} [diplomatic dialogue mean]{.underline} that
[unsolved problems]{.underline} retain the potential of
[becom]{.underline}ing [crises]{.underline}---and in those crises, [a
more capable and powerful Chinese nuclear element may play a
role.]{.underline} To rejuvenate its capacity for strategic thinking,
the United States needs to quickly get better at reading Chinese sources
in the original language, so as to immerse as much as possible in the
untranslated writings and statements of authoritative Chinese voices. So
far, not nearly enough attempts have been made to really grapple with
primary sources in Chinese or to translate or sponsor research by
Chinese scholars. Foreign-policy specialists and historians need to be
brought into discussions and research on nuclear issues. U.S. Strategic
Command should increase its outreach among academics and
researchers---to help educate but also to be exposed to the perspectives
of specialists not normally talking with nuclear planners. One hesitates
to call for yet more university or think tank programs, but a renewed
emphasis on training for the next generation of nuclear strategists is
long past due. Above all, the United States must return to a discipline
of strategic thinking, sponsoring serious cross-disciplinary discussions
on nuclear issues, preparing the intellectual and policy landscape in
advance of a crisis, and refraining from spasmodic and uncoordinated
grasping at straws amid a crush of events. A crucial role will be played
by [the U.S. Nuclear Posture Review (NPR),]{.underline} whose current
iteration was just completed as part of the National Defense Strategy.
Though not yet released publicly, the [NPR is already making waves
for]{.underline} walking back then-presidential candidate Joe [Biden's
comments]{.underline} during the 2020 campaign that [the "sole purpose
of the U.S. nuclear arsenal should be deterring---and if necessary,
retaliating against---a nuclear attack."]{.underline} The
[Biden]{.underline} administration [initially indicated that its focus
would be]{.underline} [on arms control and reducing the role of nuclear
weapons in U.S. national security strategy]{.underline}, according to
the 2021 Interim National Security Strategic Guidance.
[Now]{.underline}, according to the Arms Control Association, [the NPR
"leaves open the option to use nuclear weapons not only in retaliation
to a nuclear attack, but also to respond to non-nuclear threats" in
extreme emergencies.]{.underline} According to a Pentagon fact sheet,
the Biden administration remains committed to "reducing the role of
nuclear weapons and reestablishing our leadership in arms control," as
well as avoiding costly arms races. Yet [the nuclear policies
of]{.underline} both [Russia and China]{.underline} may
[make]{.underline} those [goals obsolete]{.underline}---or overtaken by
events, as they say in government. The NPR will play a critical role if
it can respond to geostrategic reality and help reinsert the nuclear
issue into a broader, whole-of-defense framework integrating the
highest-level political questions with operational plans. Given Putin's
nuclear saber rattling, the NPR may understandably fail to set the stage
for a pivot to Asia on nuclear issues. But [the Kremlin's threats only
underline why it is not enough for the NPR to consider issues such as
U.S. nuclear modernization---it is questions of strategy, intent,
psychology, doctrine, and escalation that must come to the
fore.]{.underline} **[Nuclear blackmail]{.underline}**, [attempts to
curtail]{.underline} U.S. [conventional operations]{.underline},
[threatening allies, and]{.underline} even the use of [**tactical
nukes** must all be considered as options Beijing might
pursue]{.underline}. Deterring such threats will require a more flexible
and robust U.S. nuclear strategy tied to geopolitical scenarios and
possible contingencies. But even more importantly, all these scenarios
must be thoroughly thought through beforehand. [Historically, **states**
have **escalated when facing** the prospect of **imminent
defeat**]{.underline}---and Putin has a track record of following
through on his threats. And if Biden truly intends to focus on arms
reduction, then he must figure out how to do so with China, given that
[Beijing has]{.underline}, since the 1960s, [steadfastly refused to
enter any arms control talks or even set up a reliable nuclear
hotline]{.underline}. The announcement that Biden and Xi agreed to
explore talks on arms control during their mid-November 2021 virtual
summit is welcome, but [there is a long road ahead to reach substantive
discussions]{.underline}. The White House must guard that the Chinese
don't use the tactic of talking about talks to endlessly delay
meaningful engagement on nuclear issues. Unlike with the multiple
agreements and constant negotiations between Washington and Moscow
during the Cold War and its immediate aftermath, the Chinese
consistently fall back on their "no first use" pledge, defensive
orientation, and low number of warheads relative to the United States
and Russia as excuses for not joining any arms reduction talks. If the
PLA is to have 1,000 warheads across multiple delivery systems in just a
decade's time---and with tensions over Taiwan and the South China Sea at
their highest level in decades---"there will be much talk about slowing
that arms race down with arms control agreements, but that is unlikely
to happen, as we learned during the first cold war," University of
Chicago political scientist John Mearsheimer told me. Wishing for
dialogues about strategic stability will not make any substantive talks
come about, nor should anyone believe that, after years of contentious
Sino-U.S. ties, Beijing will suddenly have a change of heart and limit
its nuclear arsenal. China refused the Trump administration's attempts
to bring it into strategic security talks and join U.S.-Russia
negotiations over the New START treaty. Washington will have to figure
out a different type of signaling. The new NPR could do its part by
making clear that U.S. Strategic Command now takes China seriously as a
nuclear threat and will be adjusting doctrine and operational activities
accordingly. A half-century after the U.S. reopened relations with
Beijing, the specter of the world's most populous nation becoming a
full-on adversary with nuclear arms is the last outcome Washington
wanted, especially in an environment where Russia's nuclear brinkmanship
has returned to geopolitics. U.S. policymakers have consistently
underestimated China's intentions, given a pass to its aggressive
international behavior, and seemed hesitant to respond to the massive
growth of its military. They must not make the same mistake with China's
ambitious nuclear armament plans. China has repeatedly surprised the
United States, and while the thought of any nuclear conflict between the
two may seem unthinkable, the risks from complacency are simply too
high. Many will see any resumption of serious nuclear planning as
provocative and will want to continue reducing the role of nuclear
weapons in U.S. defense strategy. They can take solace from the fraught,
dangerous, and sometimes terrifying Cold War era. It was the unpleasant
task of taking nuclear war seriously that likely prevented it from ever
breaking out. In an imperfect world, that is the best that can be hoped
for, and a lesson we ignore at our peril.

#### US-led sharing and investment in biotechnology for the alliance [solves]{.underline} -- leads to effective development of biomining

Joe **Gould '21**, is senior Pentagon reporter for Defense News,
covering the intersection of national security policy, politics and the
defense industry., "Pentagon seeks microbe miners to cut rare earth
reliance on China", AirForceTimes, 9/8/21,

WASHINGTON ― [Researchers at the Pentagon have launched a project that
aims to extract rare earth minerals critical for military technologies
from domestic sources]{.underline} ― [using microscopic
bugs]{.underline}.

The potentially **[revolutionary biotechnology doesn't exist yet, but
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency wants to develop it as a
step toward ending American dependence on China]{.underline}**, the
globe's top supplier of the minerals. DARPA's director, Stefanie
Tompkins, said at the Defense News conference Wednesday she would
determine whether it's worthwhile on an industrial scale to use microbes
as biofilters.

"[From a DARPA perspective, we're looking at: what are some of the
barriers for the U.S. to maintain dominance in rare earth
processing]{.underline}," said Tompkins, a former Army intelligence
officer and geologist who joined DARPA from the Colorado School of
Mines.

DARPA in July launched the Environmental Microbes as a BioEngineering
Resource, or Ember, a four-year program to leverage advances in
microbial and biomolecular engineering to develop what it envisions as a
scalable, bio-based separation and purification strategy. It's aimed at
expanding supplies of 17 elements used in magnets for electric motors,
high-temperature ceramics and lasers.

"We don't even have an evaluation of proposals yet, but we've done
enough early assessment of the science to say the physics and the
chemistry that underlies the science make it something that should be
possible to be able to demonstrate sufficient scale and the potential to
scale up manufacturing to make it worthwhile," Tompkins said.

**[Biomining uses microorganisms to extract metals from rock ores or
mine waste and can be used to clean up sites polluted with
metals]{.underline}**, according to the American Geosciences Institute.
[When valuable metals like copper, nickel and gold are bound up in solid
rock, one biomining technique uses microbes to break down the
surrounding minerals and another breaks down the metal
itself]{.underline}.

**[Biomining is considered an environmentally friendly alternative to
toxic, chemical-intensive processes that could]{.underline}**, Tompkins
said, **[be deterring U.S. companies from extraction
efforts]{.underline}**.

[The effort is just part of Washington's stepped-up efforts to shore up
defense supply chain vulnerabilities laid bare by the global coronavirus
pandemic]{.underline}. The Pentagon's Office of Industrial Policy
announced last week it had established a two-year, department-wide
"supply chain resiliency working group."

**[The House Armed Services Committee's own supply chain task force
recently]{.underline}** highlighted shortages of personal protective
equipment and **[warned that China and other adversaries "are capable of
weaponizing supply chain vulnerabilities]{.underline}**." **[Its
recommendations on rare earth materials called for developing alternate
extraction and processing methods, as well as increasing collaboration
with allies to lessen U.S. reliance on China]{.underline}**.

**[Those broader supply chain efforts include a push to reshore supplies
of rare earths]{.underline}**. Earlier this year, the Pentagon awarded a
\$30.4 million contract to Lynas Rare Earths Limited to boost domestic
processing of light rare earth elements. The firm will use the funds to
open a processing facility in Hondo, Texas, through its U.S. subsidiary,
Lynas USA.

The human brain, with its approximately 100 billion interconnected
neurons, enables our higher cognitive abilities without being a
physiological outlier from other primate species (Herculano-Houzel,
Reference Herculano-Houzel2012). This incredibly complex organ can also
host debilitating clinical disorders, including seizures, depression and
anxiety, Parkinson's disease, and many others. Unlocking the secrets of
the human brain is one of the largest scientific challenges to ever be
undertaken. [Advances in neuroscience research have enabled us to
further our understanding of the brain and develop technologies to read
and write brain activity, with implications for understanding behavior
and decision-making.]{.underline}

In the past decade, [the United States and the People's Republic of
China have begun large neuroscience research projects]{.underline} along
with several other international actors, including Canada, Korea, Japan,
Australia, and the European Union (EU) (International Brain Initiative,
n.d.). These brain initiatives have ambitious goals that are only now
possible with advances in genetic tools and imaging techniques (National
Institutes of Health, n.d.c). The U.S. BRAIN (Brain Research through
Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Initiative has a stated goal of
"accelerating the development and application of innovative technologies
... to produce a revolutionary new dynamic picture of the brain that ...
shows how individual cells and complex neural circuits interact in both
time and space" (National Institutes of Health, n.d.b). Additionally,
the BRAIN Initiative was highlighted as a major component of the United
States' innovation strategy for breakthrough technologies (Office of
Science and Technology Policy, 2015). The China Brain Project's
framework focuses on the ability to develop technologies both for
diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders and for mimicking human
intelligence and connecting humans and machines (Poo et al., Reference
Poo, Du, Ip, Xiong, Xu and Tan2016).

[While the initial public focus of these brain projects has been
clinical technologies to cure disease and return faculties to people,
such research is likely to enable augmentation and use for healthy
people in both the commercial and military sectors. The U.S. BRAIN
Initiative and the China Brain Project emphasize]{.underline} the
importance of [neuroscience research to treat and prevent brain
disorders]{.underline} in aging populations, [but]{.underline} they
[also]{.underline} highlight additional goals for
[accelerating]{.underline} basic research in the United States and
[applied research in]{.underline} [human-machine teaming]{.underline} in
China (National Institutes of Health, n.d.b; Poo et al., Reference Poo,
Du, Ip, Xiong, Xu and Tan2016). [The]{.underline} [dual-use technologies
made possible by all seven brain projects are likely to have profound
implications for society, public health, and national security. From a
national security perspective, it would be valuable to be able to
predict the dissemination of neurotechnologies to both the commercial
and military sectors.]{.underline} This research presents the first
analytical framework that attempts to do so.

Like past scientific and technological breakthroughs, [cognitive
sciences research is purported to have an impact on future security
policies]{.underline}. Since the cognitive sciences focus on humans,
they are intricately tied to the study of social processes, including
the realms of politics and security. International scientific bodies,
including the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the United Kingdom's
Royal Society, have also engaged in discussions on the field's policy
relevance (National Research Council, 2008, 2009; Royal Society,
Reference Society2012[). Experts]{.underline} involved in
[developing]{.underline} [NATO's]{.underline} New [Strategic
Concept]{.underline} released in 2010 [noted]{.underline} that "less
predictable is the possibility that research breakthroughs will
transform the technological battlefield," and that "[allies and partners
should be alert for potentially disruptive developments]{.underline} in
such dynamic areas as information and communications technology,
cognitive and biological sciences, robotics, and nanotechnology" (NATO,
2010, p. 15; emphasis added). Interest in neurosciences is not limited
to any specific nation, and the potential for new technology to affect
conflict and cooperation has been recognized.

Security-related research in neuroscience and operationalization of
scientific discoveries into commercial or deployable neurotechnologies
present concerns for policymakers and scholars. Not only do the effects
and use of military applications of cognitive science and neuroscience
research require their attention, but also the [increasing understanding
of cognitive processes continues to provide new perspectives on how we
understand policy and politics.]{.underline}

[Though]{.underline} the [United States has spent more money on its
brain project, started its brain project earlier, and has a more robust
innovation system that has led to better R&D capabilities in both the
private and public sectors]{.underline}, **[China is a more likely to be
the first adopter of BCI technologies in both the commercial and
military sectors]{.underline}** [because of its government structure,
sociocultural norms, and greater alignment of brain project goals with
military goals]{.underline}. Its coordinated national focus has driven
investment in brain-machine intelligence and BCI technologies. While the
U.S. military has also indicated high interest in human-machine teaming
and the United States has invested a large sum of money in brain-related
research, [there is a disconnect between the stated military goals for
brain research and the basic research goals driving the U.S. BRAIN
Initiative]{.underline}. Additionally, [the cultural values of the
United States, including an emphasis on individual identity and a
distrust of new technologies]{.underline} that have not proven their
usefulness, [will hinder BCI adoption both commercially and
militarily.]{.underline}

[China's early adoption of BCIs could have **important implications for
U.S. national security**]{.underline}. [These truly emerging
technologies]{.underline}, though nascent, [may give China a **military
advantage** through cognitive enhancement of warfighters and improved
human-machine teaming]{.underline} when matured. Additionally, China's
native supply of research monkeys, coupled with lack of ideational drive
away from primate research, will lower barriers to developing
commercially and militarily viable invasive BCIs that can read and write
brain activity with better accuracy and precision.

BCIs]{.underline}. If [China]{.underline} is the most viable place to
produce and market BCI technologies, it [may]{.underline} [have a large
influence on the supply of BCIs that will]{.underline} eventually [be
used in the United States and other countries]{.underline}. [This could
lead to **privacy**]{.underline} **[issues for very personal
data]{.underline}**---**[the activity of a human brain]{.underline}**
[and interpretations of that activity that give insight into mental
state and mood]{.underline}. Finally, [being a first mover on BCI
technology may allow China to **set ethical norms for BCI
use**]{.underline}. Understanding the brain to treat disease is a noble
cause and should be pursued. However, [the technologies enabled by this
heavy investment in brain research have clear **dual-use** capabilities
that will **shape society and warfare**.]{.underline}

The Commerce Department imposed sanctions on Chinese technology
companies and announced recently that [China's military is engaged in
dangerous work related to "**brain control" warfare**
research.]{.underline} The announcement of the sanctions provided
limited specific details of the work [by China's Academy of Military
Medical Sciences]{.underline} and 11 related Chinese research
institutes. Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security said only that
[the academy and its affiliates are using "**biotechnology** processes
to support Chinese military end-uses and end-users, to include purported
brain-control weaponry."]{.underline} However, [three reports by the
People's Liberation Army obtained by Inside the Ring shed light on the
depths of China's brain warfare research and show that it has been
**underway for several years**]{.underline}. [The translated 2019
reports discuss]{.underline} developing [brain control]{.underline}
[weaponry a]{.underline}s part of what Chinese officials call [the
"intelligentization" of warfare]{.underline}. According to one of the
reports, [advances in science and technology are leading to upgrades in
methods and the ability to subdue enemies]{.underline}. "[**War has
started to shift** from the pursuit of destroying bodies to **paralyzing
and controlling the opponent**]{.underline}," [said the report
headlined]{.underline}, "[The Future of the Concept of **Military
Supremacy**]{.underline}." "[The focus is to **attack the enemy's will
to resist**, not physical destruction]{.underline}," it stated. [Brain
science]{.underline} is being used to [extend warfare in the sphere of
human consciousness "causing the **brain** to become **the main target
of offense** and defense of new concept weapons]{.underline}," the
report added. "[To **win without fighting** is no longer
far-fetched]{.underline}," it stated, quoting ancient strategist Sun
Tzu's maxim. The report, which was published in the official military
newspaper PLA Daily, also asserted that [China is merging four major
technology fields for military purposes: nano, bio, information and
cognition.]{.underline} The intended result will be enhanced individual
capabilities. "[Future human-machine merging will revolve around the
contest for the brain]{.underline}," the report said. "The two
[combatant sides will use]{.underline} various kinds of [brain control
technologies]{.underline} and effective designs [to focus on taking over
the enemy's way of thinking and his awareness]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} even directly [intervene in the thinking of the enemy
leaders and staff]{.underline}, [and with that produce **war to control
awareness and thinking**]{.underline}," the report said[. A
second]{.underline} Chinese [report]{.underline}, also from 2019,
[disclosed that brain-machine interface is part of Beijing's plan for
the development of intelligentized warfare]{.underline}. The second
report said "[interactive intelligentization" will involve]{.underline}
"[direct control of machines using thoughts through mature
**brain-machine interface**]{.underline}." Fused intelligentization is
also being studied and involves [integrating humans and machines toward
the goal of creating **enhanced human physiological and cognitive
capacities**]{.underline}. [A third report]{.underline} published by the
PLA [revealed]{.underline} that [the China Electronic Technology Group
is working on "**brain confrontation**" technology **for
warfare**]{.underline}. Among its various [research focuses
are]{.underline} "[brain control technologies]{.underline}, such as
[measuring neuronal activity]{.underline} in the brain and translating
neuro-signals into computer signals, [establishing]{.underline}
uni-directional or [bi-directional signal transmission]{.underline}
between the brain and external equipment," the third report said.
[Research also is being conducted on "**neuro-defense**]{.underline}"
technology [such as]{.underline} "[leveraging electromagnetic,
biophysical, and material technologies to enhance human brain's defense
towards brain-control attacks]{.underline}," it said. One brain
enhancement technology involves [wearable equipment]{.underline} that
stimulates or [manipulates brain electrical activities]{.underline}.
Another is the use of [brain-implanted microchips]{.underline} or other
computer interfaces that [enhance]{.underline} [brain
functions]{.underline}. In sanctioning the Chinese institutes, the
Commerce Department said [the research activities are "**contrary to
U.S. national security** and foreign policy."]{.underline} The other
institutes hit with sanctions include China's Institute of Health
Service and Medical Information; the Institute of Radiation and
Radiation Medicine; the Institute of Basic Medicine; the Institute of
Hygiene and Environmental Medicine; the Institute of Microbiology and
Epidemiology; the Institute of Toxicology and Pharmacology; the
Institute of Medical Equipment; the Institute of Bioengineering; the
Field Blood Transfusion Institute; the Institute of Disease Control and
Prevention; and the Military Veterinary Research Institute. The 11
institutes have been added to the Commerce blacklist called the Entity

8.2 [WEAKNESSES OF THE WEST Although]{.underline} the [Chinese strategic
culture is more adapted to cognitive warfare]{.underline}, the West has
facilitated the Chinese policy at two levels: the state of our
democracies and the outdated Western strategic culture. [Polarization
within democracies is a **blessing** for Beijing. People are more likely
to look at information that **confirms** their **ideology**, rather than
**contradictory information**]{.underline}. Technological developments
have amplified the importance of information and data in our security
environment. Information is a resource that is and will increasingly be
used to destabilize countries, in particular democracies. While they are
not new, [**disinformation campaigns**, **fake news**, or **conspiracy
theories**, are used to **fragment** Western states and **polarize** the
public opinion, thereby weakening our democratic values and systems,
increasing distrust and discontent towards political systems, and
promoting populist and nationalist movements]{.underline}. People look
for information and people on social networks that confirm their logic
(echo chambers). [This exacerbates existing antagonisms, sows social
division, and undermines faith in institutions]{.underline}. This is
[facilitated through microtargeting and behavioral data]{.underline}
(e.g., Cambridge Analytica) based on Open Sources Intelligence (OSINT).
The rise of populist leaders and increasing support for digital
authoritarianism worldwide illustrates the penetration and success of
cognitive warfare by authoritarian states. Our democratic and open
information society will increasingly be targeted by such operations of
information manipulation. [**Disruptive technologies** will increase
this trend, as the operational surface and speed increase tenfold with
AI and quantum computing]{.underline}. The human brain is the
battlefield of the 21st century (MWI, 2018). By relying on human
cognitive flaws such as confirmation bias or our natural intellectual
laziness (leading to an absence of critical thinking), manipulating
information through the information environment will continue to be a
preferred means to weaken our democracies. These clashes of narratives,
storytelling and communication will be an integral part of the
operational strategy in future conflicts. The opponents of democracies
have understood, as Nick Reynolds (2020) notes, that "in political
warfare, disgust is a more powerful tool than anger. Anger drives people
to the polls; disgust breaks up countries." Moreover, citizens of
democratic countries participate in this decline, reinforcing these
logics of silos and tribalism, as this false information is "liked"
and/or re-shared. Alicia Wanless talks about "participative propaganda."
All this is further facilitated by bots and troll factories as well as
by repetitive and characterized exposure, by mutually reinforcing
stories. Therefore, [the development of more and more sophisticated
means such as artificial intelligence, communication strategies,
marketing, branding and neurosciences facilitate
**manipulation**]{.underline} and form a major challenge because of the
inherent characteristics of human brain functioning, such as cognitive
bias and heuristics. In a world in which the dominance of "Western
values" is increasingly challenged by other cultures and models, it
would be naïve to believe that the way of fighting, implying rules of
engagement and codes of honor, will be maintained in the wars to come.
On the contrary, [opposing cultures and strategic visions will multiply
in the coming years.]{.underline} One of the two colonels who wrote
Unrestricted Warfare amplified his thoughts in August 1999: "War has
rules, but they are set by the West\.... If you use these rules, then
the [weak]{.underline} CHINA AND COGNITIVE WARFARE: WHY IS THE WEST
LOSING? 8 - 4 NATO-CSO-STO [states don't stand a chance]{.underline}\...
We are a weak state, so should we fight according to your rules? No."
There is a tendency in the West towards "mirror imaging" the enemy,
presupposing that he will follow the same rationality. The contemporary
vision of conflicts is in this way still too much impregnated with "the
Western paradigm of war": the confrontation between States with the same
political, cultural and ideological concepts. Consequently, [**Western
strategic culture** is not adapted to hybrid and cognitive
warfare]{.underline}. The West appears to forget too often that war is a
contest of wills, and even more today than in the past, a battle for
perceptions and worldviews. We can retain different reasons for this.
[First, Western strategic culture is linked to a **binary** approach to
things: good or bad, white or black]{.underline}. The West finds itself
in a predetermined theory-practice relationship, leaving little room for
out-of-the-box thinking. For Womack, [Western thought is determined by a
"transaction logic."]{.underline} This is [characterized by a
contractual relationship and a desire to be in a **win-lose,
cost-benefit** relationship]{.underline} (Pan, 2016). [The Chinese will
place more **emphasis** on the relationship itself and its **mutual
benefits** by playing on respect]{.underline} in order to ultimately
gain an advantage. Also, unlike the West, for example, China will avoid
calling states enemies. This is a big advantage in cognitive warfare. In
other words, Western strategy is often going to be pre-established in a
well-defined canvas, from which it is difficult to break out -- the
facts having to fit the conceptualization or modeling, even forcing the
facts into the model. Hence also, that China defends the principles of
non-interference, and that it often avoids taking a definitive and
clear-cut position in international issues (e.g., Syria, Libya, etc.).
By refusing to see things through a binary reading (good-evil,
democracy-dictatorship), it leaves itself a continuous margin of
maneuver, avoiding forcing or imposing the situation, allowing it to
ride the wave of the situation's potential, which is not the case for
the West. Second, [the Western way of war is based on
tech]{.underline}nology [and is kinetic in a logic of a zero sum
game]{.underline}. The Revolution in Military Affairs or Offset
strategies of the US for example are based on technologic superiority in
the different domains (air, land, sea, space and cyberspace), the
cognitive or human domain is absent. [Chinese approach is more
people-centric, less techno-centric, based on relative wins and
subversion and deception]{.underline}. China plays Go, the West chess.
Technological superiority is not synonymous with winning wars as Libya,
Afghanistan and Iraq have shown. The West suffers from strategic atrophy
and incompetence, always fighting the last war, and not understanding
the next one. Cognitive warfare is an excellent example of this Western
strategic paralysis. [Third, the West]{.underline} additionally
[**differentiates** peace from war: this is not the case for China. The
rules of war are not determined anymore by the West but by our
adversaries and we have not yet grasped it]{.underline}: "Cunning
adversaries leverage the space between war and peace for devastating
effect. Washington has a buzz phrase for this: the "Gray Zone." Others
have a strategy" (McFate, 2019). The peace-war distinction is outdated
and the West has not conformed and adapted to this new reality. [Fourth,
Western military is still too **hierarchical**, **bureaucratic**,
**slow**, working in a logic of **silos** or **tunnel vision**, whereas
society is more **horizontal**, networked, **adaptive** and
**flexible**]{.underline}. As explained by General McChrystal: "Our
culture does not force leaders to reckon with the intersection of
strategy and adaptability (...) we must combine outside-the-box and
ordered thinking. This kind of hybrid leadership will be necessary not
only for success in warfare, but in other worlds as well" . Finally,
[these differences of strategic culture between China and the West are
also reflected in **cognitive differences** between Asians and
Westerners]{.underline}. R. Nisbett in different studies argues that
Easterners, compared to Westerners "have a contextual view of the world"
and events are seen as "highly complex and determined by many factors,"
whereas Westerners will follow a logic of "objects in isolation from
their context" and thus "control the objects' behavior" (Nisbett, 2003).
For Nisbett, Chinese thought is more dialectical for Nisbett then
logical: things happen in an appropriate context. It is also more
relationship based and finally where Westerners believe in stability,
Easterners see more change. Still according to Nisbett, the Chinese have
a holistic approach of the world, emphasizing relationships,
interrelations, cycles, whereas the West separates the objects of the
environment, sees a linear movement of events and has the impression to
be CHINA AND COGNITIVE WARFARE: WHY IS THE WEST LOSING? NATO-CSO-STO 8 -
5 personally in control of events: "Asians see the big picture and they
see objects in relation to their environments ‒ so much so that it can
be difficult for them to visually separate objects from their
environments. Westerners focus on objects while slighting the field and
they literally see fewer objects and relationships in the environment
than do Asians" (Nisbett, 2003).

#### Democratic model failure [cascades]{.underline} and prevents a [global]{.underline} erosion to authoritarianism that causes [nuclear war]{.underline}

Dr. Larry **Diamond 19**, Professor of Political Science and Sociology
at Stanford University, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Senior
Fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, PhD in
Sociology from Stanford University, Ill Winds: Saving Democracy from
Russian Rage, Chinese Ambition, and American Complacency, p. 199-202

[The most obvious response to the **ill winds blowing** from the world's
autocracies is to help the winds of freedom blowing in the **other
direction**]{.underline}. The [democracies]{.underline} of the West
cannot [save themselves if they do not **stand with democrats** around
the world]{.underline}.

[This is truer now than ever]{.underline}, for several reasons. [We live
in a globalized world, one in which **models**]{.underline}, trends, and
ideas [**cascade across borders**. Any wind of change may gather
**quickly** and blow with **gale force**. People everywhere **form
ideas** about how to govern]{.underline}---or simply about which forms
of government and sources of power may be irresistible---[based on what
they **see happening elsewhere**. We are now immersed in a fierce
**global contest of ideas**, information, and norms]{.underline}. In the
digital age, that contest is moving at lightning speed, shaping how
people think about their political systems and the way the world runs.
[As **doubts** about and **threats** to democracy are **mounting** in
the West, this is not a contest that the democracies can afford to
lose]{.underline}.

Globalization, with its flows of trade and information, raises the
stakes for us in another way. Authoritarian and badly governed regimes
increasingly pose a direct threat to popular sovereignty and the rule of
law in our own democracies. Covert flows of money and influence are
subverting and corrupting our democratic processes and institutions.
They will not stop just because Americans and others pretend that we
have no stake in the future of freedom in the world. If we want to
defend the core principles of self-government, transparency, and
accountability in our own democracies, we have no choice but to promote
them globally.

It is not enough to say that dictatorship is bad and that democracy,
however flawed, is still better. Popular enthusiasm for a lesser evil
cannot be sustained indefinitely. People need the inspiration of a
positive vision. Democracy must demonstrate that it is a just and fair
political system that advances humane values and the common good.

To make our republics more perfect, established democracies must not
only adopt reforms to more fully include and empower their own citizens.
They must also support people, groups, and institutions struggling to
achieve democratic values elsewhere. The best way to counter Russian
rage and Chinese ambition is to show that Moscow and Beijing are on the
wrong side of history; that people everywhere yearn to be free; and that
they can make freedom work to achieve a more just, sustainable, and
prosperous society.

In our networked age, both idealism and [the harder imperatives of
**global**]{.underline} power and [**security** argue for more
democracy, not less]{.underline}. For one thing, [if we do not worry
about]{.underline} the [quality of governance]{.underline} in
lower-income countries, [we will face more and more **troubled and
failing states**. **Famine** and **genocide** are the curse of
authoritarian states, not democratic ones. Outright **state collapse**
is the ultimate, bitter fruit of tyranny. When countries like **Syria**,
**Libya**, and **Afghanistan** descend into **civil war**; when poor
states in Africa cannot generate jobs and improve their citizens' lives
due to rule by corrupt and callous strongmen; when Central American
societies are held hostage by brutal gangs and kleptocratic rulers,
people flee---and wash up on the shores of the democracies]{.underline}.
Europe and the United States cannot withstand the rising pressures of
immigration unless they work to support better, more stable and
accountable government in troubled countries. [The world
has]{.underline} simply [grown too small]{.underline}, too flat, and too
fast [to **wall off**]{.underline} rotten [states]{.underline} and
pretend they are on some other planet.

[**Hard security interests** are at stake]{.underline}. As even the
Trump administration's 2017 National Security Strategy makes clear, [the
**main threats**]{.underline} to U.S. national security [all stem from
**authoritarianism**, whether in the form of tyrannies from **Russia**
and **China** to **Iran** and **North Korea** or in the guise of
antidemocratic terrorist movements such as **ISIS**]{.underline}.1 [By
supporting the development of democracy around the world, we can deny
these authoritarian adversaries the **geopolitical running room** they
seek]{.underline}. Just as Russia, China, and Iran are trying to
undermine democracies to bend other countries to their will, so too can
[we **contain**]{.underline} these [autocrats' ambitions by
helping]{.underline} other countries [build effective]{.underline},
resilient [democracies]{.underline} that can withstand the dictators'
malevolence.

Of course, democratically elected governments with open societies will
not support the American line on every issue. But no free society wants
to mortgage its future to another country. The American national
interest would best be secured by a pluralistic world of free
countries---one in which autocrats can no longer use corruption and
coercion to gobble up resources, alliances, and territory.

If you look back over our history to see who has posed a threat to the
United States and our allies, it has always been authoritarian regimes
and empires. As political scientists have long noted, [**no two
democracies** have **ever gone to war** with each other---**ever**. It
is not the democracies of the world that are supporting international
**terrorism**, proliferating **w**]{.underline}eapons of
**[m]{.underline}**ass **[d]{.underline}**estruction, [or threatening
the territory of their neighbors]{.underline}.

The overall strategic significance and **[game-changing]{.underline}**
aspects of [enhanced soldiers]{.underline} and technologies aimed at
developing cyborg soldiers [may be]{.underline} [viewed as a
threat]{.underline} by some. The threat perspective is supported by the
argument that [cyborg technology is almost impossible to
detect]{.underline}, very difficult to deter, [and]{.underline}
therefore, [highly challenging to defend against]{.underline}. If the
strategic landscape **[after]{.underline}** the year
**[2025]{.underline}** changes sooner than expected or contains
ambiguous threats against which [**we lack capabilities** to detect and
defend]{.underline}, **[the balance of power]{.underline}** [as well
as]{.underline} the very definition of "[asymmetric
warfare]{.underline}" [will be **forever altered**]{.underline}. What is
clear is that [the introduction of human/machine enhancements into
military and civilian populations will create **new vulnerabilities**
that will need to be mitigated by **security
architectures**]{.underline}. Cyborg technologies will create a world
awash in data in which [individuals will record images and audios or
generate geographic coordinates and time stamps]{.underline}. In some
cases, these processes will occur automatically [in the background
without willful intention]{.underline} as part of the course of daily
events (called "transactional records" by Wittes and Chong).27 To record
or to transmit data is also to enable collection or interception of that
data. Unless one specifically engineers the cyborg to resist such
collection or interception, [it will by default **facilitate
surveillance**]{.underline}. Relatedly, due to their surveillance
capabilities, [cyborgs could be selectively tracked and targeted unless
appropriately shielded]{.underline}.

From a national security perspective, [adversaries may piggyback
surveillance]{.underline} and tracking technologies [within]{.underline}
implanted [cyborg mechanisms]{.underline}. In the words of one study
participant, "[If I can't walk into a sensitive compartmented
information facility]{.underline} wearing an iWatch or [carrying a
cellphone]{.underline}, [how will security be confident it is safe to
allow a cyborg to walk in there]{.underline}?" In short, [an enhanced
soldier]{.underline} with a machine interface [presents a]{.underline}
potential [security risk]{.underline} and complicates work [within
secure environments]{.underline}.

Machines respond to commands, and [if command and control are
hacked]{.underline}, [the human]{.underline}/machine [will be
compromised]{.underline}. **[Hackability]{.underline}** by external
forces [could generate the]{.underline} **[fear of control by
others]{.underline}**. Even if [this]{.underline} risk [can be mitigated
through enhanced **encryption** methods]{.underline},
[variable]{.underline} **[authentication]{.underline}**
[requirements]{.underline}, or other methods, [the perception that
control could be subverted may lead to **issues of trust** among
peers]{.underline}. For example, [if a hostile actor could **override
an** optogenetic body suit or neural **implant** that controls muscle
movement, this could not only create a **true threat to the individual,
organization, and mission**, but could **promulgate fears** among the
ranks of non-enhanced and enhanced individuals]{.underline}.

Lastly, consider that these are [advanced technologies]{.underline} that
[can and will travel the world outside of traditional security
controls]{.underline} put in place to prevent exploitation. Technology
[ownership and chain of command of an enhanced soldier is nontraditional
(]{.underline}e.g., an enhanced soldier plans a vacation to foreign
countries, which poses diplomatic and security risks). Thus, there is a
need for increased and sustained trust at the individual-user level that
the system will perform reliably (i.e., that verification and validation
have been done) in and across a range of settings and circumstances.

This research looks at public funding for neuroscience research and
development (R&D) through the U.S. BRAIN Initiative and the China Brain
Project. Though other sources of funding for neuroscience are present in
both nations, we chose to analyze these brain projects because of their
importance as an articulation of national strategy for neuroscience
research that could enable earlier adoption. Their stated goals and
directed funding, which involves stakeholders from government, academia,
military, and industry, can be viewed as a cohesive national strategy
for identifying top-priority areas of neuroscience research and
determining how findings from this research will be translated into new
technologies. Each project also has components to enable translational
research---that is, moving from basic research through applied R&D.
Additionally, the brain projects serve as a diplomatic interface for
international collaboration by fostering data inventorying and sharing,
as well as promoting consensus on international norms for ethical use of
these technologies (International Brain Initiative, n.d.).

Focusing on one emerging neurotechnology, instead of a broad
investigation of many neurotechnologies, enables more robust analysis of
the sociocultural, governmental, and economic influences that could
drive adoption of a specific dual-use technology. [BCIs are a dual-use
technology directly enabled by brain project funding that both the
United States and China have a stated interest in developing for
commercial and military applications]{.underline}. [These devices have
the potential for high adoption by healthy people for both civilian and
military purposes, and they are already available on the
market]{.underline} (Emondi, Reference Emondin.d.; Farnsworth, Reference
Farnsworth2017). Additionally, [these devices may raise significant or
even profound ethical concerns involving **data privacy and individual
autonomy**]{.underline} (Global Neuroethics Summit Delegates et al.,
Reference Rommelfanger, Jeong, Ema, Fukushi, Kasai and Singh2018;
Moreno, Reference Moreno2003). Likely for these reasons, the U.S.
Congressional Research Service (2021) identified [BCIs]{.underline} as
an emerging technology that [should be considered for export
controls]{.underline} to nations like China. [BCIs fit the definition of
dual-use technology in two ways]{.underline}: [BCIs can be used for both
civilian and military purposes, and BCI technologies intended for
civilian use could be co-opted for malicious or deleterious
misuse.]{.underline}

While other papers have addressed the potential commercial and military
applications of BCIs, none has attempted to predict adoption likelihood
or compared adoption likelihood of these devices. The ability to make
predictions about adoption likelihood in the United States and other
countries has been identified as a priority by the U.S. Army Combat
Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM), since so few studies have
been conducted to assess attitudes toward BCIs in both the public and
military sectors (Emanuel et al., Reference Emanuel, Walper, DiEuliis,
Klein, Petro and Giordano2019). [These devices, which can connect human
and machine intelligence, have the potential to]{.underline} shape
society and **[change the nature of warfare]{.underline}**.

In the last decade or so, a small but significant body of literature has
emerged on the intersection of advances in the cognitive and
neurosciences and conflict across multiple disciplines. [A significant
portion of the studies and policy literature on cognitive sciences
research is concerned with the ethics of such research. The ethical
concern]{.underline}s raised [largely fall into two are]{.underline}as
of debate---(1) [human enhancement and]{.underline} (2) [thought privacy
and autonomy]{.underline}---[both of which are relevant to the current
security research on cognition]{.underline}. The issue of cognitive
enhancement has been a contested area of research (Parens, Reference
Parens and Illes2006). While [some embrace]{.underline} the potential of
"[neuropharmaceuticals]{.underline}" [and advocate industry's
self-regulation, others have raised concerns about]{.underline} the
potential for [political inequality and the]{.underline} possible
[disruption of natural physiological processes]{.underline} (Fukuyama,
Reference Fukuyama2003; Gazzaniga, Reference Gazzaniga2005; Hitchens,
Reference Hitchens2021; Naam, Reference Naam2005). [The issue of thought
privacy]{.underline} often em[anates from advancements in noninvasive
imaging and stimulation techniques]{.underline} used for neurological
research. Many of the concerns relate to how [such advancements could be
used for lie detection and interrogation, including applications for
domestic or foreign intelligence]{.underline} (Canli et al., Reference
Canli, Brandon, Casebeer, Crowley, DuRousseau, Greely and
Pascual-Leone2007; Wild, Reference Wild2005).

These ethical discussions have also extended to military R&D in the
cognitive sciences. What role, if any, neuroscience research should play
in national security and how its impact should be understood have been
hotly debated (Evans, Reference Evans2021; Krishnan, Reference
Krishnan2018; Marcus, Reference Marcus2002; Moreno, Reference
Moreno2006; Munyon, Reference Munyon2018; Tracey & Flower, Reference
Tracey and Flower2014). [Some have advocated against the inclusion and
use of neuroscience techniques for national security purposes, while
others justify the defense and intelligence community's involvement in
consideration of maintaining the superpower status of the United
States]{.underline} (Giordano et al., Reference Giordano, Forsythe and
Olds2010; Rippon & Senior, Reference Rippon and Senior2010; Rosenberg &
Gehrie, Reference Rosenberg and Gehrie2007). Still, s[ome have contended
that neuroethics must be considered in national security discussions,
while others have advocated that the security use of neuroscience
research is best framed as a consideration for human rights]{.underline}
(Justo & Erazun, Reference Justo and Erazun2007; Lunstroth & Goldman,
Reference Lunstroth and Goldman2007; Marks, Reference Marks2010). In
discussing classified research on brain imaging, an open dialogue
between scientists and government officials has been called for (Resnik,
Reference Resnik2007). The place and role of neurosciences research and
neurotechnology in security policy remain contested, and neither a
security nor an ethical framework acceptable to all parties under which
such research can be analyzed exists.

Another major area of social science work, often empirical and
positivist in nature (rather than normative), can be found in research
that approaches neuroscience and neurotechnology from a technology
survey or qualitative case study method to probe its implications,
including understanding the national security implications and
approaches to reducing risk (Binnendijk et al., Reference Binnendijk,
Marler and Bartels2020; DeFrancoet al., Reference DeFranco, DiEuliis and
Giordano2019; Huang & Kosal, Reference Huang and Kosal2008; Rachna &
Agrawal, Reference Rachna and Agrawal2018; Royal Society, Reference
Society2012). Some such studies are more descriptive and others are more
systematic, depending on the researcher and the scholarly discipline,
ranging from political science and international relations to public
policy and science and technology studies. Many, but not all, consider
neurotechnologies in the context of chemical and biological weapons and
their respective international legal bodies and biosecurity policy
(Dando, Reference Dando and Rappert2007; DiEuliis & Giordano, Reference
DiEuliis and Giordano2017; Nixdorff et al., Reference Nixdorff,
Borisova, Komisarenko and Dando2018).

In addition to the earlier discussion on the theoretical approaches to
the relationships between technology and conflict more generally, there
are specific theoretical questions that apply to the realm of
neuroscience in the context of military technology, strategic
decision-making, and conflict. How [advances in the cognitive
neurosciences may undermine rational actor theory, a core component of
nuclear deterrence theory]{.underline}, has been theorized (Stein,
Reference Stein, Paul and Morgan2009). Other work has considered how
[scientists]{.underline} and neuroscientists, the very people whose
research is in the spotlight, [understand]{.underline} and view [the
security risks and potential consequences of such research and its
implications for international security and governance]{.underline}
(Kosal & Huang, Reference Kosal and Huang2015). This work adds to that
systematic body of literature in the social sciences.

Despite the continuity in the basic nature of deterrence, [significant
geopolitical, doctrinal and technological developments now demand that
we again adapt our deterrence goals, means and applications]{.underline}
to a new strategic landscape. During the Cold War, US nuclear deterrence
strategies had to adapt to the relatively slow changes and enduring
continuities of a bipolar strategic environment, and thereafter to the
dramatic systemic transformation brought on by the collapse of the
Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact. A basic task now is to understand how a
third and dramatically different new strategic environment must again
reshape the character of our deterrence strategy---its necessary means
and application, particularly including the role of nuclear weapons.

[Effective deterrence and extended deterrence for US allies requires
that US deterrence capabilities be sufficiently credible, as perceived
by diverse adversaries, to cause them to decide against the provocations
we have identified as unacceptable, now and in the future. Doing so now
demands that we be capable of adapting our deterrence strategies and
capabilities]{.underline} to shifting circumstances, including future
adversaries and contexts that are not now obvious. This is a task of
uncertain dimensions and unpredictable demands.

[The rapid pace of technological innovation and proliferation has
magnified the scope of change and uncertainty in the emerging threat
environment. Adversaries and potential adversaries are improving
familiar capabilities and acquiring new and unprecedented instruments of
coercion and warfare]{.underline}. Some appear willing to employ or
abide by the employment of weapons that have, until recently, been
deemed outside supposedly global norms, such as chemical weapons.
[Improvements in ballistic and cruise missiles, missile defenses,
a]{.underline}nti-[a]{.underline}ccess and [a]{.underline}rea
[d]{.underline}enial measures, [hypersonic, cyber and space weapons have
or will open new domains for threat and warfare, and,]{.underline}
correspondingly, [pose new challenges for US deterrence
strategies]{.underline}.

This new strategic environment is very different from that of the Cold
War or the immediate postCold War period. As we consider how to adapt
deterrence to the realities of this period [we]{.underline} first [need
to understand the necessary deterrence roles for our nuclear weapons
given the emerging spectrum of adversaries and potential adversaries who
are pursuing external goals that threaten us, our allies and the
existing post-Cold War order in general. Effective nuclear deterrence is
increasingly important in this new strategic environment characterized
by severe, coercive nuclear threats against us and our allies, and the
increasing prospect for adversary employment of nuclear weapons, and
possibly other WMD.]{.underline}

#### Scenario 3 -- Totalitarianism -- 

#### Unmanaged BCIs cause collapse into global totalitarianism

This paper identifies [a new **existential risk** factor]{.underline}
that [has not been recognised in prior literature]{.underline}:
[Brain-Computer Interfaces (**BCIs**).]{.underline} We illustrate how
[BCI]{.underline} technology [could significantly raise the existential
risk from global totalitarianism in the near future.]{.underline} In
particular this is achieved [not just by]{.underline} expansion of
[surveillance, but]{.underline} the expansion of [brain
stimulation]{.underline}. At present, **[this risk factor has been
entirely unnoticed]{.underline}**. We suggest that [given
the]{.underline} **[high likelihood of its impact]{.underline}**, [and
the]{.underline} [possible]{.underline} **[magnitude]{.underline}** of
such an impact, [it deserves more attention, more research, and more
discussion.]{.underline} Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are
technologies that allow the brain to interface directly with an external
device. In particular, [BCIs]{.underline} have been developed to [read
mental and emotional content from neural activity]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} have been developed to [intentionally stimulate or
inhibit]{.underline} certain kinds of [brain activity]{.underline}. At
present BCIs are used primarily for therapeutic purposes, but their
potential use case is much wider. Though this sounds somewhat like
science fiction, [the current state of the technology is much more
advanced than most realise]{.underline}. In particular,
well-corroborated research prototypes already exist (Guenther et al,
2009; Moses et al, 2019); a number of companies, including [Facebook and
Neuralink, are working to commercialise this technology]{.underline}
over the coming decades (Constine, 2017; Musk, 2019); and there is
widespread agreement among BCI researchers ([86% agreement]{.underline})
[that this technology]{.underline} is not just theoretically feasible,
but [will be on market in the near future]{.underline} (Evers & Sigman,
2013; Merrill & Chuang, 2018; Nijboer et al, 2011). [The
risks]{.underline} this technology poses however, [have been almost
entirely neglected.]{.underline} This paper outlines how the
[development and]{.underline} widespread [deployment]{.underline} of
BCIs [could]{.underline} significantly [raise the likelihood of long
term global totalitarianism]{.underline}. We suggest two main methods of
impact. Firstly, [BCIs allow for an **unparalleled expansion of
surveillance**]{.underline}, as [they enable states (or other actors) to
surveil even the mental contents of their subjects]{.underline}.
Secondly, [BCIs make it easier]{.underline} than ever [for]{.underline}
[totalitarian dictatorships to **police dissent**]{.underline} [by
using]{.underline} **[brain stimulation to punish dissenting
thoughts]{.underline}**, [or even]{.underline} **[make certain kinds of
dissenting thought a physical impossibility.]{.underline}** Global
[existential risks]{.underline} are risks that [threaten]{.underline}
the [premature extinction]{.underline} of earth originating life
(Bostrom, 2012) [or]{.underline} that threaten "[the permanent and
drastic reduction of its potential for desirable future
development]{.underline}" (Cotton-Barratt & Ord, 2015). As such, while
some existential risks pose the danger of extinction, some do not.
Nuclear war is an example of an existential risk that poses a risk of
human extinction. However, [irreversible global totalitarianism
is]{.underline} often considered [an existential risk]{.underline} too,
because even without posing any extinction risk, [it has the capacity to
irreversibly destroy]{.underline} or permanently lessen a great level of
[humanity's potential]{.underline} (Ord, 2020). A risk factor is
typically not an existential risk, but is something that makes an
existential risk more likely. Often this means increasing the
probability that a certain event might occur or increasing the
likelihood that a catastrophic event becomes existential. For example,
relating to risk of extinction from nuclear war, a risk factor might
increase the likelihood that a nuclear war begins. Alternatively, a risk
factor might instead increase the likelihood that a nuclear war is
catastrophic enough that it leads to extinction or unrecoverable
collapse. Both would be valid risk factors. A practical example of a
risk factor is international conflict. While international conflict
could have very negative impacts, by itself it would not be considered
an existential risk, because conventional war offers little chance of
extinction or of permanently curtailing our long-term potential.
However, higher levels of conflict between great powers might
drastically raise the odds of a nuclear war and thus increase the odds
of an existential catastrophe. As such, high levels of international
conflict could be considered a risk factor for nuclear war. While risks
and risk factors are often separate categories, this is not universal --
the categories are not mutually exclusive. For example, Torres (2016)
argues that climate change could be both an existential risk in itself,
as runaway global warming could make the earth physically uninhabitable
and threaten extinction, but could also be a risk factor that might
increase the likelihood of other kinds of existential risks. For
example, increased climate change might increase global instability,
make international cooperation less viable, and compromise the
conditions necessary to address other existential risks. Designing,
building, and launching solutions to risks such as an asteroid strike
would be far more difficult in a world preoccupied with other survival
issues. A security factor is the opposite of a risk factor. It is
something that reduces the chance that an existential risk occurs. For
example, good international governance may be a security factor that
lessens the chance of nuclear war. Just as action to avoid existential
risk is crucial, dealing with risk factors can be as important or in
some cases even more important than dealing with the risks themselves
(Ord, 2020). For example, if the chance of a particular existential risk
occurring is 10%, but a risk factor brings this chance up to 90%, it may
end up being more cost effective to address the risk factor before
addressing the risk itself. This is not always the case, but there can
be strong justification for working on alleviating existential risk
factors when it is cost effective to do so. This paper seeks to identify
and outline the danger and likelihood of a new and unnoticed existential
risk factor. A brain-computer interface (or BCI), is an interface
between a brain and an external device. Certain forms of [BCIs already
exist]{.underline}; the term refers to a range of technologies, used for
a number of purposes. At present, the most well known commercial uses of
BCIs include recovering lost senses, as with cochlear implants used to
restore hearing and retinal implants to restore sight (Anupama et al,
2012). However, BCIs have a vastly broader set of uses that already
exist as either in-use medical technologies or as well corroborated
research prototypes. This section outlines a few of these uses to give
an idea of the current and near term scope of the technology. For the
purposes of our explanation, there are two broad functions of BCIs. The
first kind of [BCIs]{.underline} are able to [read neural
activity]{.underline}, [record it, interpret it, send it, and use it for
a variety of purposes.]{.underline} The second kind of [BCIs are able to
write to the brain]{.underline}. They are able to [influence and modify
brain activity]{.underline}, stimulating or suppressing various
responses by using skull mounted micro-electrodes, or by using less
invasive transcranial electrical stimulation. These two types could be
combined and used together, though for clarity we will refer to them as
type 1 and type 2 BCIs to differentiate function. Type 1 BCIs are able
to read neural data, but also report and send this data for a number of
purposes. These have already been used to translate speech from neural
patterns in real time (Allison et al, 2007; Guenther et al, 2009; Moses
et al, 2019), and to detect positive and negative emotional states from
neural patterns (Wu et al, 2017). It is expected that [near term
BCIs]{.underline} of this [kind will be able to detect intentional
deception, detect even subconscious recognition, and detect more precise
and complex thought content]{.underline} (Bellman et al, 2018; Bunce et
al, 2005; Evers and Sigman, 2013; Roelfsema, Denys & Klink, 2018). There
are many practical uses of recording and interpreting neural data. So
far, BCIs have been used in primates to allow them to control prosthetic
limbs and smart devices with thought, by sending mental commands
directly to the relevant device (Carmena et al, 2003; Ifft, 2013; Moore,
2003). These same techniques have also been used to assist people who
are paraplegic or quadriplegic by providing them with a neural shunt
that records messages from the brain and sends these messages directly
down to where the muscles are activated, allowing patients to use
previously disabled limbs (Moore, 2003). Many companies also have the
long term goal of allowing users to mentally transmit messages to other
BCI users, allowing silent communication with only a thought (Kotchetkov
et al, 2010). The uses of type 2 BCIs are even more varied. Many uses
are therapeutic. Deep brain stimulation for example, has used neural
stimulation to treat various disabilities and conditions, including
Parkinson's disease (Deuschl et al, 2005; Glannon, 2009; Perlmutter,
2006). Similar techniques have been used to alleviate disorders such as
OCD (Abelson et al., 2005; Greenberg, 2006), and have been suggested as
potential future treatments for conditions like Alzheimer's and
depression (Laxton et al., 2013; Mayberg et al., 2005), and even to
restore function in those with motor disability after a stroke (Gulati
et al, 2015). Through deep brain stimulation, [control of physical pain
responses is also a possibility]{.underline}. [Such]{.underline}
[techniques]{.underline} have been used to [alleviate chronic
pain]{.underline} (Bittar et al, 2005a; Kumar et al, 1997), [treat
phantom limb syndrome]{.underline} (Bittar et al, 2005b), [augment
memory]{.underline} (Suthana, 2012; Hamani et al., 2008), [and
more]{.underline}. Just as BCIs can currently suppress pain, **[pain
responses can]{.underline}** also **[be stimulated]{.underline}**
[for]{.underline} a variety of purposes, from [interrogation to
incentivisation to punishment]{.underline}. Similarly,
[BCIs]{.underline} are already able to [artificially stimulate or
suppress emotional reactions]{.underline} (Delgado, 1969; Roelfsema et
al., 2018). These are just a few of the corroborated functions of BCIs.
In future, it has been suggested that BCIs could be used as a possible
treatment for cravings and addictions, and as a way to alter internal
drives and rewards systems (Mazzoleni & Previdi, 2015; Halpern, 2008).
"Consider eating a chocolate cake. While eating, we feed data to our
cognitive apparatus. These data provide the enjoyment of the cake. The
enjoyment isn't in the cake per se, but in our neural experience of it.
Decoupling our sensory desire from the underlying survival purpose
\[nutrition\]will soon be within our reach." -- Moran Cerf, Professor at
Northwestern University, Employee at Neuralink. The potential uses of
BCIs are well corroborated. The primary difficulties at present include
scaling down costs, size, and invasiveness, and scaling up precision to
allow BCIs to target more neurons, more specifically. At present,
significant research and development is being done on BCIs to address
these issues, to expand their capabilities, and to make BCIs orders of
magnitude cheaper, more precise, less invasive, and more accessible to
the broader population. Companies currently working on developing cheap,
publicly accessible advanced BCIs include Facebook (Constine, 2017),
Kernel (Kernel, 2020; Statt, 2017), Paradromics and Cortera (Regalado,
2017), and Neuralink (Musk, 2019). In addition to this, DARPA, the
research arm of the US military, is funding significant research in this
direction (DARPA, 2019; Kotchetkov et al, 2010), as is the Chinese
government (Munyon, 2018; Tucker, 2018). In short, with so many well
funded companies and governments working on this problem, it is likely
that these barriers will quickly fall. To reinforce this, [market trends
for BCIs speak of strong expected growth]{.underline}. The global BCI
market was valued at [\$1.36 billion in 2019]{.underline}
[but]{.underline} is projected to reach [\$3.85 billion by
2027]{.underline}, [growing by 283% in]{.underline} just [eight years
(]{.underline}Gaul, 2020). The likelihood of development of X-risk
relevant BCIs within this century is relatively high. As a point of
clarification, this paper does not argue that all BCIs act as an
existential risk factor. It seems incredibly unlikely that cochlear
implants have any impact on the likelihood of any existential risk.
However, we do argue that certain kinds of more advanced BCI may be
extremely dangerous and may drastically raise the risk of long-lasting
global totalitarianism. The current literature on global existential
risk from BCIs is scarce. The vast majority of the literature on risk
from BCI has focused on impacts at a very low scale. Such low-scale
risks that have been considered include surgical risk from operations,
possible health related side effects such as altered sleep quality, risk
of accidental personality changes, and the possibility of downstream
mental health impacts or other unknown effects from BCI use (Burwell et
al., 2017). Potential threats to individual privacy have also been
identified -- specifically, the risk of BCIs extracting information
directly from the brains of users (Klein et al, 2015). At a higher
scale, Caplan (2008) successfully identified '[brain scanning
technology']{.underline} as a factor that [may]{.underline} impact
existential risk at some point in the next thousand years by [assisting
with the maintenance of dictatorships]{.underline}. However, Caplan
focuses only on risk within the next millennium, and does not consider
the high potential for this to occur [in a far shorter time
frame]{.underline}; in particular, within the next hundred years. He
also only briefly mentions brain scanning as a technology and does not
consider the risk from [brain scanning]{.underline} technology being
[present and active in all citizens at all times]{.underline}. Such
widespread use is a stated goal of multiple current BCI companies.
Finally, Caplan does not consider the full depth of the impact of BCIs
-- only mentioning the capacity of brain scanning to increase the depth
of surveillance, while ignoring the existential risk posed by the
widespread use of brain stimulation. A final risk identified in prior
literature is cybersecurity, though prior literature has primarily
focused on the threat to individuals. Specifically, the risk has been
discussed in relation to vulnerabilities in information security,
financial security, physical safety, and physical control (Bernal et al,
2019a). BCIs, just like computers, are vulnerable to manipulation by
malicious agents. [BCIs and brain scanning offer an unprecedented level
of personal information, passwords, as well as data about a user's
thoughts, experience, memories and attitudes, and thus offer an
attractive terrain for attackers]{.underline}. It is likely that
[security flaws will]{.underline} be used by malicious actors to [assist
with cybercrime]{.underline}. Further previously identified risks here
[include]{.underline} risk [of identity theft, password hacking,
blackmail, and even compromising the physical integrity of targets who
rely on BCIs as a medical device]{.underline} (Ienca, 2016; Bernal et
al, 2019b). The use of deep brain stimulation for coercion or control of
BCI users is also a possible source of risk (Demetriades et al, 2010).
Corroborated possibilities here include control of movement, evoking
emotions, evoking pain or distress, evoking desires, and impacting
memories and thinking processes -- and these are just the earliest
discovered capabilities (Delgado, 1969). However, past papers have
exclusively focused on risk to individuals; that individuals may be
sabotaged, surveilled, robbed, harmed, or controlled. Past research has
not yet explored the risk to humanity as a whole. This paper seeks to
take the first steps to fill that gap and outlines the
[risks]{.underline} that [BCIs provide at a broader, global
scale]{.underline}, [addressing the risk they pose to the future of all
of humanity. Dissent]{.underline} from within [is]{.underline} [one of
the major vulnerabilities of totalitarian dictatorships]{.underline}.
[BCIs]{.underline} offer dictators a powerful tool to [counteract
this]{.underline} weakness. Increases in abilities for
[surveillance]{.underline} would [make it easier to identify and root
out dissent or root out skeptics who]{.underline} might betray the
party, and thus would make it easier to maintain totalitarian control.
While conventional surveillance may allow for a high level of
monitoring, such as tracking of citizens' behaviour and actions, it
provides no way for a dictator to peer inside the minds of their
subjects. Because of this, the difficulty of identifying the attitudes
of careful defectors remains high. BCIs constitute an unprecedented
threat here. [Surveillance through already existing methods may fail to
expose some threats]{.underline} to a totalitarian regime, such as party
members who carefully hide their skepticism. But [**BCI** based
**surveillance would have no** such **flaw**]{.underline}. The level of
intrusion here is potentially quite severe. With the advancement of
BCIs, it is highly likely that [in the near future we will see a rapid
expansion in the ability to observe the contents of another's
mind]{.underline}. Some researchers claim that [advanced BCIs will have
access to more information about the intentions, attitudes, and desires
of a subject than those very subjects do themselves]{.underline},
suggesting that even subconscious attitudes and recognition, as well as
intentional deception and hidden intentions will be detectable by BCIs
(Bunce et al, 2005; Evers and Sigman, 2013). Already, [BCIs]{.underline}
are able to [detect unconscious recognition of objects that a subject
has seen but cannot consciously remember seeing]{.underline} (Bellman et
al, 2018). Others have even suggested that by more precisely recording
the activity of a larger number of neurons, [future BCIs will be able to
reveal not just perceptions and words, but emotions, thoughts,
attitudes, intentions, and abstract ideas like recognition of people or
concepts]{.underline} (Roelfsema et al., 2018). Attitudes towards ideas,
people, or organisations could be discovered by correlating emotions to
their associated thought content, and dictatorships could use this to
discover attitudes towards the state, political figures, or even ideas.
This would allow detection of dissent without fail and allow a dictator
to quell rebellion before a rebellious thought is even shared. Some
might hope for BCIs that do not have this level of access, but
[accessing and recording mental states is a fundamental and unavoidable
feature of many BCI]{.underline}s. In order to achieve their desired
functions, many BCIs need a clear way to read neural data. Without
significant neural data they simply cannot function -- it is impossible
to translate neural data to exert some function if one does not have
access to that neural data. Brain stimulators and BCIs are specifically
designed to allow this kind of access; it is crucial for the effective
functioning of the device (Ienca, 2015). It is of course possible that
BCIs made by some companies will be exclusively targeted to certain
sections of the brain, for example, only targeting areas associated with
speech, and not targeting other areas associated with emotions or
thought. This is conceivable, though it is not clear that all companies
and countries would do the same. Furthermore, the utility gained by
expanding to other areas of the brain beyond the speech centre means it
is highly doubtful the technology will remain restrained indefinitely.
It is likely that [BCIs will be created by companies, which have strong
financial incentive to record the neural states of users]{.underline},
if only to gain more information with which to improve their own
technology. [This]{.underline} [information could be requisitioned by
governments]{.underline}, as is frequently done to tech companies at
present -- [even in democratic countries]{.underline}. Further
exacerbating this problem, [privacy laws have a history of struggling to
keep pace with technological advancements. In]{.underline} more
autho[ritarian countries, neural data might be transmitted directly to
state records, and the preservation of privacy may not be attempted at
all.]{.underline} In essence, [BCIs allow an easy and accurate way to
detect **thoughtcrime**]{.underline}. For the first time, [it will be
possible for states to surveil the minds of its citizens. Deep
surveillance of this kind would increase the likelihood that
**totalitarian dictatorships would last indefinitely.**]{.underline} In
addition to recording neural activity, [there is an even greater threat
that has not been considered as an existential risk factor in any prior
literature]{.underline}. In addition to reading brain activity,
[BCIs]{.underline} are able to [intentionally influence the
brain]{.underline}. In particular, future [BCIs will]{.underline} be
able to [**rewire pleasure and pain responses** and allow us to
intentionally **stimulate or inhibit emotional responses en
masse**]{.underline}. Where this is done consensually and is desired,
this may be of some benefit. However, **[nothing]{.underline}** about
this technology [**guarantees consent**.]{.underline} In addition to
being able to identify dissident elements more effectively than ever
(due to increased surveillance), [BCIs]{.underline} will also powerfully
[increase the ability of states to control their subjects]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} their ability to [maintain that control
indefinitely]{.underline}. In such a situation, [identification of
dissidents would no longer be necessary]{.underline}, as [a state could
guarantee that **dissident thought would be a physical
impossibility**]{.underline}. Finely honed [BCIs]{.underline}
[can]{.underline} already trigger, and associate, certain emotions or
stimuli with certain concepts (Roelfsema et al., 2018). This could be
used to [mandate desirable emotions towards some ideas or make
undesirable emotions literally impossible]{.underline}. Though this
possibility has been discussed in literature for its therapeutic uses,
such as triggering stimulation in order to respond to negative obsessive
thoughts (nullifying negative emotions caused by such thoughts) there is
huge potential for misuse. [A malicious controller could **stimulate
loyalty** or affection]{.underline} in response to some ideas,
[or]{.underline} even for specific organisations and people; and could
[stimulate hatred in response to others]{.underline}. It could also
inhibit certain emotions, so that **[citizens would be physically unable
to feel anger at the state]{.underline}**. [The ability to trigger and
suppress emotional content]{.underline} with BCIs [has already existed
for years]{.underline} (Delgado, 1969). Combined with complex and
detailed reading of thought content, [this is a highly dangerous
tool]{.underline}. Some might argue that dissident action may be
possible even with an outside agent controlling one's emotional affect.
This is highly debatable, but [even without any control of this
emotional content, the risk from BCIs is still extreme]{.underline}.
[BCIs]{.underline} could condition subjects to [reinforce certain
behaviour]{.underline} (Tsai et al, 2009), [or]{.underline} could be
used to [stimulate aversion to inhibit undesired behaviour]{.underline}
(Lammel et al, 2012), [or stimulate the pain or fear
response]{.underline} (Delgado, 1969) [and **cause intense and unending
pain** in response to certain thoughts or action]{.underline}s --
[or]{.underline} even in response to [a lack of
cooperation]{.underline}. Even without controlling emotional affect,
[the state could punish dissident thoughts in real time, and make
considering resistance a practical impossibility]{.underline}. [This is
a powerful advantage for totalitarian states, and a strong reason for
**authoritarian states** to **become** more
**totalitarian**]{.underline}. In addition to surveillance, [it creates
a way to police the population and gain full cooperation from citizens
in a way that]{.underline} (once established in all citizens) **[could
not be resisted]{.underline}**. Machine learning programs scanning state
databases of neural activity could detect thought patterns towards the
state that are deemed negative and punish them in real time. Or, if the
state is more efficient, [it could simply stimulate the brains of
subjects to enforce habits, increase loyalty, decrease a subject's
anger, or increase their passivity]{.underline} (Lammel, 2012; Tsai et
al, 2009). At worst, [the brain could be re-incentivised, with errant
emotions turned off at the source, so that dissenting attitudes are
unable to ever form]{.underline}. Even [high level dissent or threat of
coup would be virtually impossible in a totalitarian state of this kind.
Its long term internal security would be assured. BCIs]{.underline} also
offer an easy way to [interrogate dissidents and guarantee their
cooperation]{.underline} in helping to find other dissident camps --
which might be otherwise impossible. In past resistances, certain
dissidents have been considered near-impossible to completely wipe out
due to features of terrain making it impossible to locate them in a cost
effective way. If the government were able to access and forcibly apply
BCIs, resistance would be a dramatically weaker obstacle. Dissenters
might normally lie or not cooperate, but with BCIs, they simply need to
be implanted and rewired. Then they would be as loyal and cooperative as
any other, and could actively lead the state to their previous allies.
Even unconstrained [defectors could not be fully trusted as they may one
day be controlled by the state.]{.underline} Another issue for the long
term survival of totalitarian dictatorships is coups or overthrows from
within, as citizens or party officials are often tempted by different
conditions in other states. With BCIs, [the loyalty of regular citizens
and even party officials could be assured]{.underline}. In current
dictatorships, wiping out dissidents (particularly nonviolent
dissidents) often has a significant social cost that can delegitimise
and destabilise regimes (Sharp, 1973). A dictatorship whose citizens are
all implanted with BCIs would not pay this social cost. At present, when
dictators crack down it can cause riots and resistance, which can cause
dictatorships to fall. [With BCIs, **governments will not need to
appease their citizens** at all to maintain loyalty. **They need only
turn up the dial**.]{.underline} In this section we explore some global
strategic implications of BCIs. In particular, that [BCIs allow
totalitarian regimes to be stable over the long term, even without
requiring global totalitarianism.]{.underline} We also argue that [BCIs
make authoritarian regimes more likely to become totalitarian in the
first place]{.underline}, and [that BCIs create a strategic equilibrium
that inclines us towards a world where **all countries become
totalitarian.**]{.underline} Totalitarian states may fail for a few
reasons. Conquest by external enemies is a danger, and since
totalitarian states tend to stagnate more than more innovative liberal
states, this may be a danger that grows over time. Internal dangers
occur too; citizens may choose to rebel after comparing their lives to
more prosperous countries in the outside world. Violent and nonviolent
resistances have been able to overthrow even harsh authoritarian regimes
(Chenoweth, 2011), and at least one totalitarian state has been
overthrown by popular uprising (specifically, the Socialist Republic of
Romania). It has been suggested that the presence of successful liberal
countries may tempt defection among the members of authoritarian and
totalitarian countries. Maintaining the morale of citizens and the inner
elite is a primary issue. Orwell (1945) and Caplan (2008) both propose
that global totalitarianism would allow a totalitarian state to escape
these risks of rebellion, as there would be no better condition for
subjects to be tempted by or to compare their lives to. However, with
BCIs, global totalitarianism would no longer be necessary; BCIs can
disarm these issues. Not only is identification of dissent easier; the
capacity for dissent can be entirely removed such that it never even
begins. Loyalty and high morale can be guaranteed and biochemically
enforced. Typically, it is hard to maintain commitment to totalitarian
ideologies when free societies deliver higher levels of wealth and
happiness with lower levels of brutality and oppression. BCIs could
neutralise this problem, making temptation physically impossible,
loyalty guaranteed, and regimes internally stable forever. In addition
to this internal stability, regimes could also be stable to external
threats through the development of nuclear weapons, which powerfully
discourage war and provide security from foreign nations. Being safe
from both internal and external threats would have significant impacts
on the lifespan of a totalitarian country. In addition to increasing the
longevity of dictatorships, [BCIs also increase the likelihood that
totalitarian systems will form.]{.underline} In particular, this is
because [conventional dictatorships will now have a far more powerful
incentive to become totalitarian]{.underline}, as [BCIs would make it
cheap, easy, and most importantly, incredibly advantageous to do
so]{.underline}. As established above, there is significant survival
value in being able to identify and remove all opportunities for
internal dissent and make rebellion literally 'unthinkable'. If the
misuse of BCIs would vastly improve the odds of survival for both a
dictator and their government, then there is powerful reason for
dictators to transition to BCI reinforced totalitarianism. Survival
would be a powerful reason to descend to totalitarianism. It will be
cheaper and easier to surveil and to police citizens than ever before,
and the benefits to dictators of doing so will be large. Therefore, BCIs
may increase not just the longevity of totalitarian states, but also the
likelihood that they occur in the first place. Finally, and most
importantly, [BCIs create a worrying strategic environment that may
incline all countries to eventually become totalitarian, and may incline
totalitarianism to entrench itself globally]{.underline}. With
[BCIs]{.underline} to [stabilise]{.underline} themselves [from internal
resistance and nuclear weapons to stave off invasion, totalitarian
countries would almost never fall]{.underline}. They would be secure
from internal threats, and secure from external ones. Meanwhile,
[democratic countries that do not brainwash their citizens could be
secure externally but might still at some point degenerate to a more
authoritarian form of government]{.underline}. [Democratic governments
have rarely lasted more than a few centuries in history, and have often
temporarily slid into dictatorship or authoritarianism.]{.underline} At
present, democracies can descend to dictatorship, and dictatorships can
have revolutions and rise to democracy. [With BCIs however,
**democracies can still collapse, but dictatorships are able to last
forever**]{.underline}. This is a dangerous equilibrium, as it means
that [free countries will still eventually fall, as they do at present,
but when they do, they will not be able to climb back out]{.underline}.
Democracies could still collapse to dictatorship, but dictatorships
could never rise from that state. [In a world where democracies are
mortal but dictatorships live forever, **the global system is inevitably
inclined towards totalitarianism**.]{.underline} Over time, one by one,
individual democratic powers would fall to authoritarianism and use BCIs
to establish irreversible, immortal totalitarian dictatorships in their
own regions. The former-democracy would then be able to maintain a
stable, BCI-reinforced authoritarian state indefinitely. In a world
where a) countries that preserve mental freedom might possibly
degenerate into such totalitarian countries, b) totalitarian
dictatorships are immortal, and c) there is no available territory for
new free countries to be founded, it creates an equilibrium whereby
countries will steadily converge upon becoming dictatorships. A free
country might not be free forever, and might at some point collapse into
dictatorship, and then reinforce itself with BCIs. However, once a BCI
reinforced dictatorship is established, it is likely to last
indefinitely. Eventually, every free country would fall. And fallen
countries would remain fallen forever. [This provides a clear path into
a multi-polar global totalitarian order. At present, this is not a major
concern, as dictatorships (even totalitarian dictatorships) can be
overthrown]{.underline}. Thus the likelihood of all countries falling to
totalitarianism one by one, without having countries rise back to
democracy, is very low. We suggest that [BCIs make the path to a global
multi-polar totalitarian system much more likely.]{.underline} The
timeframe for such a shift is hard to predict. However, if BCI
reinforced totalitarianism is already entrenched in a greater number of
countries, then the problem may be drastically harder to stop, and the
overall risk will be higher. This offers an unusual circumstance in
regard to existential risks. With more time, it is likely that more
countries will fall, and the more totalitarian countries there are, the
harder this problem will be to solve. As such, [this is a problem that
may be easier to address earlier than later.]{.underline} There may be
less of a risk from BCI use if there is a strong ability to prevent
technological proliferation to despotic governments. This is
conceivable. However, the level of success over the last 100 years at
preventing proliferation depends heavily on features of individual
technologies. With many weapons that we seek to limit access to, such as
nuclear weapons, proliferation is not stopped by restricting knowledge
(which is typically very difficult) but by restricting access to
materials like enriched uranium. It seems like [there is no significant
materials shortage for BCI technology]{.underline}, as [current BCIs do
not require any fundamentally rare or unique materials]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [it is easier to prevent proliferation of technologies used
by governments and militaries than it is to prevent proliferation of
technologies used by civilians]{.underline}. [Because BCIs are currently
being planned as a widespread commercial technology, available to
civilians, other countries are likely to gain access to them and have
the opportunity to reverse engineer them]{.underline}. With this in
mind, anti-proliferation methods would need to focus on preventing
spread of knowledge about the development or security of BCIs -- an
incredibly difficult task for consumer products.

This research focuses on analyzing one emerging technology that has been
identified as having security significance: [the commercial and military
adoption of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs),]{.underline} a nascent
neurotechnology, [by the United States and China]{.underline}. These two
nations are the focus because they are among the largest spenders on
brain projects, and they [are increasingly seen as peer economic and
military competitors]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} particular recent
[emphasis on technological competitiveness]{.underline} between the two
(Dobbins et al., Reference Dobbins, Shatz and Wyne2018; Ferchen,
Reference Ferchen2020; Lewis, Reference Lewis2018; O'Rourke, Reference
O'Rourke2020; Rasser, Reference Rasser2020; Wray, Reference Wray2020).
The 2018 U.S. National Defense Strategy highlighted "[long-term,
strategic competition" with China as a top priority in context of great
power competitio]{.underline}n (Campbell & Ratner, Reference Campbell
and Ratner2018; Colby & Mitchell, Reference Colby and Mitchell2020
Jones, Reference Jones2020; Tellis, Reference Tellis, Tellis, Szalwinski
and Wills2020; Wu, Reference Wu2020). This competition [will naturally
include vying for "technological advantage," especially with emerging
technologies like those enabled by the brain projects to avoid
technological surprise]{.underline} (U.S. Department of Defense 2018).
Future [work may **consider other nations**]{.underline}.

Adoption of truly emerging technologies, like neurotechnologies, in both
the commercial and military sectors is likely to have important
implications for the strategic competition between nations, making them
important case studies for predicting neurotechnology adoption
likelihood. In economics, the advantages and disadvantages of being a
"first mover" or a "fast follower" in new markets have been discussed
(Kerin et al., Reference Kerin, Varadarajan and Peterson1992; Wunker,
Reference Wunker2012). Most of these studies highlight very large
advantages for first movers in emerging industries, while also
acknowledging that fast followers occasionally benefit by learning from
any missteps that a first mover makes or by capitalizing on the high
development costs that first movers incur. This terminology has also
been applied to nations' strategies toward emerging technologies.
Notably, [the U.S. National Security Commission on Artificial
Intelligence highlighted in its 2021 report "the first-mover advantage
of developing and deploying technologies like microelectronics,
biotechnology, and quantum computing"]{.underline} (National Security
Commission on Artificial Intelligence, 2021). [Being a first mover would
enable a nation's private industry to capitalize on a growing market for
neurotechnologies. It may also allow that first-mover nation to play a
lead role in setting the ethical and legal norms internationally for
these devices.]{.underline} Therefore, being able to anticipate which
nation is most likely to be a first mover and see widespread technology
development and dissemination is crucial to understanding the national
and international security landscape. Additionally, the pursuit of new
capabilities, including first acquisition and deployment, has been
studied as part of the arms race literature (Evangelista, Reference
Evangelista1989; Gray, Reference Gray1974; Hundley, Reference
Hundley1999).

Interoperability of military units in a tactical sense is not the only

[these are not guaranteed to align on the issue of human/machine

attitudes from the Pew Research Center's study on cyborg technologies
indicated clear alignment to religious commitment, allies with a strong
history of religiosity may be more reluctant to accept foreign cyborg
soldiers operating on a shared military base within their borders.

competitors,24--26 the study group postulated that [it is unlikely that

For strategists and scholars of revolution in military affairs, which
focuses on emerging technologies and posits that [**military
technological transformations** and the accompanying organizational and
doctrinal adaptations can lead to **new forms of warfare**]{.underline},
[the nexus between technology and military affairs bears directly on the
propensity for conflict and outcomes of war, as well as the efficacy of
**security cooperation** and coercive statecraft]{.underline} (Bernstein
& Libicki, Reference Bernstein and Libicki1998; Blank, Reference
Blank1984; Cohen, Reference Cohen1996; Herspring, Reference
Herspring1987; Krepinevich, Reference Krepinevich1994; Mahnken,
Reference Mahnken2010; McKitrick et al., Reference McKitrick, Blackwell,
Littlepage, Kraus, Blanchfield, Hill, Schneider and Grinter1995; Nofi,
Reference Nofi2006). [These]{.underline} discussions
[underpin]{.underline} the concept of [network-centric
warfare]{.underline}, [operations that link combatants and military
platforms to each other in order to facilitate information sharing as a
result of the progress in information technologies]{.underline}
(Arquilla, Reference Arquilla2002).

In the late twentieth century, one predominant model for understanding
the conditions under which conflict and cooperation are likely and how
technology can contribute to increasing or decreasing instability in the
international system was [the offense-defense model]{.underline}
(Jervis, Reference Jervis1978). This theory [asserts]{.underline} [that
more complete information]{.underline} on the intentions of rivals
[allows both sides to manage a spiraling arms race. Awareness of
aggression allows for coalition building and diplomatic
action]{.underline} in order to preemptively quell belligerence. An
advantage of [defensive technology over offensive
technology]{.underline} is that it [lowers the cost/benefit equation of
the attacker]{.underline} and, in the words of Clausewitz (Reference
Clausewitz and Greene2013), "[tame\[s\]]{.underline} the elementary
impetuosity of [War]{.underline}." [Offensive]{.underline} ascendency,
conversely, [creates a sense of urgency for states to develop greater
offensive capabilities and seek out alliances, further increasing
tensions]{.underline}. [Emerging technologies, such as]{.underline}
nanotechnologically enabled meta-materials,
**[biotechnology]{.underline}**, and neurotechnology, [may problematize
offense-defense theory by **challenging the distinction between
offensive and defensive weapons**]{.underline} (Kosal & Stayton,
Reference Kosal, Stayton and Kosal2019). This work does not seek to
resolve that issue but furthers the scholarly debate about how emerging
technologies affect international security.

Another area of scholarly work has considered and problematized the way
[emerging tech]{.underline}nologies [may challenge existing laws,
including the law of armed conflict, international environmental law,
and arms control treaties, and need to govern the introduction,
implementation, and use of emerging technologies as a means or method of
warfare]{.underline} (Leins, Reference Leins2021; Nasu & McLaughlin,
Reference Nasu and McLaughlin2014).

Conclusion

COVID-19 has been a tragedy for the world. Compounding this has been the
scourge of misinformation and its weaponised form, disinformation. The
[COVID]{.underline}-19 crisis has [brought]{.underline} together two of
the most [significant trends in emerging and disruptive military
technologies]{.underline}: **[biotech]{.underline}**nologies that
[underlie the mRNA vaccines that]{.underline} may [ultimately reign in
the **virus** and **cognitive warfare** with disinformation as the
weapon of choice]{.underline}. [Disinformation campaigns]{.underline}
are hardly new and [have long been a staple of geopolitical
conflict]{.underline}. Nevertheless[, the precision, breadth, volume,
automation and audacity of such attacks are
**unprecedented**]{.underline}. [Exploiting the situation]{.underline},
some [states]{.underline}, social groups and individuals [with
malice]{.underline} and forethought [sought to conduct **cognitive
warfare** on **entire populations**]{.underline}, using the
opportunities presented by COVID-[19 to seek political or social
advantage]{.underline}. These have had, and [will]{.underline} continue
to [have]{.underline}, **[severe consequences for Alliance
nations]{.underline}** and the health of its citizens. Ultimately, as we
have discussed in this chapter, the [NATO alliance has faced these
issues]{.underline} through the active use of S&T and a focus on facts,
concrete actions, and trust-building. Nevertheless, it is a well
understood psychological phenomenon that facts do not always win an
argument. While arguably a successful strategy, [the lingering effects
of these attacks suggest that the struggle is far from
over]{.underline}. In the end, whether it is at the strategic or
tactical level, conflict is a decidedly human activity. [The most
effective way to overcome an opponent is to impact their thoughts and
beliefs]{.underline}, thereby [turning them against
themselves]{.underline}. Continued research into disinformation and its
impact on societies will help develop new battle plans to counter these
attacks. Further, [the success and increasing development of more
sophisticated attacks suggest that **cognitive warfare** will become
even more important for the **Alliance** as potentially the **sixth
operational domain for NATO**]{.underline}.

The [geopolitical landscape]{.underline} of the twenty-first century
[offers more]{.underline} complex, dynamic, and [unpredictable global
challenges]{.underline} than those encountered in the previous century.
[Despite the unparalleled level of military/technological
dominance]{.underline} that the [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and [NATO Allies]{.underline}; [the evolving
asymmetric, kinetic, and unconventional threats from non-aligned
terrorist groups continue to evolve and escalate]{.underline}.
[Adversaries and terrorist groups have demonstrated **a strong will**
and interest to wage **unconventional war** against Western
targets]{.underline} despite their limited technological capabilities
and lack of sophistication in conducting such operations. In fact, the
unsophisticated conformations of CBRNE threats pose more technical
challenges in both point and stand-off detection. The [rapid advances
in]{.underline} both [science and tech]{.underline}nology [coupled with
universal internet access have inspired both non-state and
state]{.underline}-sponsored [actors to]{.underline} new levels of
creativity in the [development of novel and non-traditional threat
agents]{.underline}. It is apparent that [**asymmetric** threats have
changed the traditional nature of the battlefi eld]{.underline}.
Accompanying the [evolution of asymmetric threats]{.underline} is the
relative ease of their transport and engagement; thus [broadening the
potential battlefi eld and virtually eliminating the generally accepted
premise of homeland as a safe haven from catastrophic, man-made
disasters]{.underline}. Finally, the terrorist toolkit includes direct
attacks against persons, economic infrastructure, and the environment in
pursuit of their own personal and political agendas. Furthermore,
drinking water distribution systems are vulnerable to intentional and/or
inadvertent contamination. Such contamination can be accomplished with
classic and non-traditional chemical agents, toxic industrial chemicals
(TICs), and/or toxic industrial materials (TIMs). Conventional methods
employed to sense/detect such contaminants use commercialoff the shelf
(COTS) systems and broad-spectrum analytical instruments with
interpretive algorithms to detect and characterize toxic contaminants.
The current vi Preface threat environment requires detection of complex
contaminant signatures in addition to recycled pharmaceuticals present
in water supplies. Hence it is critical to seek revolutionary solution
pathways to such challenges, such as using advanced sciences convergence
(ASC) involving inter/Trans disciplinary fi elds. It is well known that
materials approaching nanoscale dimensions exhibit characteristics with
numerous unique and previously unexploited applications. Advances in
synthesis and characterization methods allow the means to study,
understand, control, and even manipulate the transitional
characteristics between isolated atoms and molecules and bulk materials.
Technological advances arise from the potential of nanoscale materials
to exhibit properties that are attributable to their small size,
physical characteristics, and chemical composition. Recently, functional
and architectural innovations in nanoscale materials have initiated
applications in chemical and biological sensing; environmental pollution
sensing, monitoring, mitigation and remediation; nano-biotechnology;
plamonics; and in-vivo analysis of cellular processes. A
nanotechnology-based sensor platform enables direct electrical detection
of chemical and biological agents in a label-free, highly multiplexed
format over a broad dynamic range. Advances made over the last few years
provide new opportunities for scientifi c and technological developments
in nanostructures and nanosystems with new architectures and improved
functionality. The fi eld is very active and rapidly developing, and
covers a wide range of disciplines. The advancement of molecular biology
and its application in environmental microbiology has represented
signifi cant advancement in the ability to rapidly detect waterborne
microbial pathogens. Molecular methods, coupled with high-throughput
parallel process may provide a greater range of microorganism detection.
The advances in of new technologies, viz. biosensors, biochips,
lab-on-chip, e-tongue, plasmonics, etc. have brought in new and
promising approaches. The ASI focus was also to summarize recent
methodologies in sensing/detecting contaminants fl ow in water
distribution system with the objectives that appropriate remediation
strategies are exercised before its entry in
residential/commercial/industrial distribution. Furthermore,
decentralized sensing plays a crucial role from an international
security standpoint. The ASI aimed to address several important and
relevant issues related to enhancing security using advanced
technological solutions. Several invited lectures, focused seminar
sessions, and student presentations addressed a range of issues such as
technological advances in chemical-biological sensors using
nanomaterials; advanced sciences convergences for international defense
and security, and waterbased contaminants sensing/detection and
mitigation. The [ASI]{.underline} was attended by participants from 23
countries thus [exemplify]{.underline}ing the [international vision of
NATO Peace for Security endeavours]{.underline}. The ASI provided an
international forum for the exploration of many key scientifi c and
technological advancements employing nanostructured and advanced
materials. Despite of initial organizational issues, the NATO ASI was
well organized and received by the participants. [To maximize global
participation]{.underline}, the [organizing committee focused on a
promotional strategy that yielded a wide range of NATO and partner
countries representation and most importantly, a wide range of
participation from multiple scientifi c disciplines.]{.underline}

The symposium objective was to explore the theoretical possibilities and
bioethical issues associated with human performance enhancement and
optimization in NATO operations. The symposium findings were:
Performance enhancement technology is generally not mature enough for
human operational test and experimentation. [Performance optimization
technology is available and the efficacy and health consequences of such
manipulations must continually be evaluated. Bioethical deliberations
concerning Human Performance Enhancement in military settings are
reactive to experimentation. Proactive policies for research and
application of enhancement technologies are required.]{.underline} Valid
potential operational scenarios were not well articulated. Absent these
scenarios, conversations about performance enhancement defaulted to
science fiction-like scenarios. **[Cooperative research in military
medical operational performance is insufficient. Synergies across NATO
partners are not exploited.]{.underline}** As such, [interoperability
resulting from collaboration and "buy-in" of best practices in
sustaining an international force is not leveraged.]{.underline}
Researchers appear to have limited understanding of performance
requirements of deployed service members and the operational realities
of commanders. Research questions were generally not proactive or
directly relevant to current or future operations. [There is limited
integration and management of knowledge related to health and
performance research. This may be hampering development of NATO-relevant
programmatic research.]{.underline}

\*CW = Cognitive Warfare

As written in the Warfighting 2040 Paper, [the nature of warfare has
changed]{.underline}. The majority of [current conflicts remain below
the threshold of the traditionally accepted definition of warfare, but
new forms of warfare have emerged such as Cognitive Warfare]{.underline}
(CW), while **[the human mind is now being considered as a new domain of
war]{.underline}**. With the increasing role of technology and
information overload, individual cognitive abilities will no longer be
sufficient to ensure an informed and timely decision-making, leading to
the new concept of Cognitive Warfare, which has become a recurring term
in military terminology in recent years. [Cognitive Warfare]{.underline}
causes an insidious challenge. It [disrupts the ordinary understandings
and reactions to events in a gradual and subtle way, but with
**significant harmful effects over time**]{.underline}. **[Cognitive
warfare has universal reach]{.underline}**, from the individual to
states and multinational organisations. [It feeds on the techniques of
disinformation and propaganda aimed at psychologically exhausting the
receptors of information]{.underline}. Everyone contributes to it, to
varying degrees, consciously or sub consciously and it provides
invaluable knowledge on society, especially open societies, such as
those in the West. This [knowledge can then be easily
**weaponised**]{.underline}. It **[offers NATO's adversaries a means of
bypassing the traditional battlefield]{.underline}** with significant
strategic results, which may be utilised [to **radically transform**
Western societies]{.underline}. The instruments of information warfare,
along with the addition of "neuro-weapons" adds to future technological
perspectives, suggesting that the cognitive field will be one of
tomorrow's battlefields. This perspective is further strengthened in by
the rapid advances of NBICs (Nanotechnology, Biotechnology, Information
Technology and Cognitive Sciences) and the understanding of the brain.
NATO's adversaries are already investing heavily in these new
technologies. **[NATO needs to anticipate advances in these technologies
by raising the awareness on the true potential of CW]{.underline}**.
Whatever the nature and object of warfare, it always comes down to a
clash of human wills, and therefore what defines victory will be the
ability to impose a desired behaviour on a chosen audience. Actions
undertaken in the five domains - air, land, sea, space and cyber - are
all executed in order to have an effect on the human domain. [It
is]{.underline} therefore [time for NATO to recognise]{.underline} the
renewed importance of the sixth operational domain, namely [the Human
Domain]{.underline}.

#### Failure to achieve standards for CW risks nuclear miscalc -- extinction

Today, [renewed great-power competition is]{.underline} being
[intensified by tech]{.underline}nological [advancements]{.underline}
that allow for the real-time relay of information [that requires
decisions be made within seconds]{.underline}. [Human beings are
embedded much more intricately into the military
tech]{.underline}nological [systems]{.underline} logic, as operator and
functional element, [in the pursuit of speed and
optimization]{.underline}. In order to function within a highly
scientific, technologically sophisticated conflict environment, those
involved in the action chain, including operators and fighters, are
themselves in need of a tune-up. Indeed, [military human enhancement is
one of the new frontiers in emerging weapons tech]{.underline}nology, as
advanced militaries across the globe are planning to enhance and augment
the capabilities of their war-fighting forces. This [development is
shifting the parameters of]{.underline} decision-making, including
[nuclear decision-making]{.underline}. [What]{.underline}, for example,
[might have happened if Petrov had been more intricately woven into the
computer system]{.underline} that reported the erroneous satellite
signal, perhaps via an implantable neural interface to facilitate
speedier human-machine communication for more efficient decision-making?
Notwithstanding its operational and strategic importance, [human
augmentation is not typically discussed in nuclear policy. This
oversight needs redress as ministries of defense begin to focus on human
enhancement as the "missing part" of the human-machine teaming
puzzle]{.underline}.[^1^](https://www.armscontrol.org/taxonomy/term/84/3?page=1#endnote01)
**Definition and History of Human Augmentation** Human augmentation is a
vast field with many linkages to other areas of study. There is no
commonly agreed definition, and it is known by many names, which are
often used interchangeably. "Augmentation" usually refers to the
transformation of capabilities to include a new or additional
capability, but "enhancement" refers to the fortification of existing
capabilities. Both concepts can be broadly defined as "the application
of science and technologies to temporarily or permanently improve human
performance."[^2^](https://www.armscontrol.org/taxonomy/term/84/3?page=1#endnote02) As
with all emerging technologies, human enhancement technologies exemplify
aspects of continuity and change. The development of physically and
mentally resilient soldiers has a long history, involving techniques and
technologies that work toward fortifying the human body and mind with
the objective of extending capacities and limiting vulnerabilities in
war. Such technological transformations begin with straightforward tools
such as a soldier's armor, the crossbow, the machine gun, the rocket
launcher, and a range of natural and synthetic substances with
pharmacological effects. Roman and Greek legionnaires strengthened their
bodies with leather and bronze and their resolve with wine, beer, rum,
and brandy. Opioids and amphetamines have long been used in battle to
gain a greater edge in
fighting.[^3^](https://www.armscontrol.org/taxonomy/term/84/3?page=1#endnote03) Pain
relievers and other synthetic drugs are instrumental in alleviating pain
and facilitating healing. Meanwhile, propaganda, systematic training,
and enemy dehumanization are used to augment or suppress the
war-fighter's emotions. Human augmentation programs today extend much
further into the development of the soldier as fighter, as well as the
solider as operator, through various modes of scientific-technological
inscriptions, shaping bodies toward greater operational efficiency and
effectiveness. [As human and machine become increasingly entwined, the
concept of the "super soldier,"]{.underline} where human tissue and
technological circuitry fuse for maximum performance, [is taking
shape]{.underline}. In May 2021, the UK Ministry of Defence and the
German Bundeswehr co-published a report that conceptualizes "the person
as a platform" and heralds the "coming of the Biotech
age."[^4^](https://www.armscontrol.org/taxonomy/term/84/3?page=1#endnote04) Half
a year earlier, China and France published reports indicating their
readiness to augment military personnel physically, cognitively,
psychologically, and
pharmacologically.^[5](https://www.armscontrol.org/taxonomy/term/84/3?page=1#endnote05),[6](https://www.armscontrol.org/taxonomy/term/84/3?page=1#endnote06)^ In
the United States, the Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency has
been investing in neurotechnology since the 1970s and today is expanding
the frontiers of the field, with a focus on neural interface
technology.[^7^](https://www.armscontrol.org/taxonomy/term/84/3?page=1#endnote07)
Current [trends in military human enhancement focus on external
enhancements such as augmented reality, exoskeletons, wearables, and
biosensors and internal augmentations through pharmacological
supplements]{.underline}. Implantable chips for a medical or curative
purpose are already on the
horizon.[^8^](https://www.armscontrol.org/taxonomy/term/84/3?page=1#endnote08) [Directly
enhancing human capabilities, however, is only half of the
equation]{.underline}. The other half is that [human augmentation will
become increasingly relevant to security and defense because it is the
binding agent between humans and
machines]{.underline}.[^9^](https://www.armscontrol.org/taxonomy/term/84/3?page=1#endnote09) Beyond
these external and internal enhancements, [there is considerable
interest in developing technologies that facilitate smoother and more
functional teaming between the human and computational
systems]{.underline} through so-called neural interface technologies.
The importance of effective integration of humans and machines is widely
acknowledged, but has been primarily viewed from a technocentric
perspective. Many of the [existing solutions]{.underline} are technology
focused, such as "building trust into the system" by making artificial
intelligence (AI) more transparent, explainable, and reliable. Although
this is necessary for cultivating trust in human-machine teams, it
[do]{.underline}es [not account for the human element in the teaming
equation]{.underline}. Proponents of human augmentation argue that it is
the necessary adjustment for a world in which future wars will be won by
those who can most effectively integrate the capabilities of personnel
and machines at the appropriate time, place, and
location.[^10^](https://www.armscontrol.org/taxonomy/term/84/3?page=1#endnote10)
As militaries increasingly incorporate automated and autonomous
processes into their operations, brain-interface technologies could
serve as a crucial element in future human-machine
teaming.[^11^](https://www.armscontrol.org/taxonomy/term/84/3?page=1#endnote11) Brain-interface
technologies offer methods and systems for providing a direct
communication pathway between an enhanced, or wired, brain and an
external
device.[^12^](https://www.armscontrol.org/taxonomy/term/84/3?page=1#endnote12) In
other words, they enable the transfer of data between the human brain
and the digital world via a neural implant. This has implications for
all spheres of military operations. What might this mean for the future
of nuclear decision-making? **Human Augmentation and Nuclear Stability**
The United States is a good case study for understanding how human
augmentation might intersect with nuclear decision-making, given that it
is more transparent about its nuclear decision-making protocols than
other states possessing nuclear weapons. There is a clear sequence of
events involved in the short period from considering a nuclear strike to
the decision to
launch.[^13^](https://www.armscontrol.org/taxonomy/term/84/3?page=1#endnote13) [When
the president decides that a launch is an option, they convene a brief
conference of high-ranking advisers]{.underline}, including members of
the military, such as the officer in charge of the war room. [Whatever
the president decides, the Pentagon must implement]{.underline}. [For a
strike decision, the next step is to authenticate the order, then the
encoded order goes out via an encrypted message. Once the launch message
has been received by the submarine and ICBM crews, the sealed
authentication system codes are retrieved and compared with the
transmitted codes in a further authentication step before
launch]{.underline}. The missile launch then is prepared. If launched
from a silo, it takes five ICBM crew members to turn their keys
simultaneously for a successful launch. [This entire process from
decision to ICBM launch can be completed within five minutes, 15 minutes
if the launch is executed from a submarine. This is already a quick
decision process with very little room for mediation, deliberation, or
error. With human augmentation, the timelines would be compressed even
further.]{.underline} To understand [the relevance of human augmentation
to nuclear decision-making, three scenarios]{.underline}, each
positioned at different points in the decision-making process, [are
illustrative]{.underline} and reflect a military context in which
nuclear weapons interact with a brain-computer interface. Such an
interface could detect when certain areas of the brain are cognitively
activated (e.g., by certain thoughts) and transmit this signal, thereby
enabling brain-controlled action or communication. The scenarios focus
on the incorporation of a brain-computer interface into nuclear
decision-making because of their potential to accelerate communications.
The ability of an interface to compress temporal timelines enables us to
probe the boundaries of the question "What is the value of a few
seconds?" [The first scenario involves]{.underline} the [advisory and
decision chain]{.underline}. Assuming the above decision chain, the
president, [upon learning of a potential threat and considering the need
to give a nuclear launch command, could shorten the deliberation time
frame of their human advisers by transferring data directly to military
participants via a brain-computer interface]{.underline}. In addition,
the senior military commander could be plugged into an AI system that
can compute many possible scenarios and give recommendations through the
brain-computer interface in real time. The upshot of human enhancement
in this scenario might be that the military adviser has more data
available through the interface, but critically, there is no guarantee
of the quality or accuracy of this data. Moreover, with civilian and
military advisers partaking in the advisory conference, there is a risk
of the same algorithmic bias that is evident in human-machine teaming
with AI systems. This refers to the tendency of humans to give
uncritical priority to decisions that are ascertained with the help of
technology, also called automation bias. This may make an advisory team
superfluous and weaken the quality of advice in a critical situation.
The mandate to act faster based on technologically derived advice could
prevail and shorten the deescalation window. In [the second scenario,
involv]{.underline}ing the [executive chain]{.underline}, the launch
crew is assumed to be partially or wholly networked through
brain-computer interfaces. Perhaps [the transmission of the launch codes
takes place directly through computational networks, shortening the time
between receiving the order, authenticating the codes, and executing the
order]{.underline}. The submarine and ICBM [crews executing the order by
coordinated action are networked to facilitate the launch]{.underline}.
In addition to the obvious vulnerabilities that any network inevitably
produces, such as information and network security compromises, this
would have the consequence of accelerating action. [Any errors may be
overlooked or not acted on in time. Particularly concerning is the
possibility that a given action could rest on flawed initial inputs or
skewed calculations, which would greatly increase the risk of
unwarranted escalation]{.underline}. Finally, [there is the Petrov
example, or the predecision phase]{.underline}. As suggested above, [the
decision chain does not really begin with the president's decision to
launch but with the input that the president receives from those in the
military chain of command]{.underline}. [If Petrov]{.underline}, the
Russian duty officer whose job [was to register apparent enemy missile
launches, had been operating with a brain-computer interface in place
and received the information transmitted directly to his brain and the
brains of other military personnel, would there have been the impetus or
indeed the opportunity to question the information from the system?
Would he have had enough time to understand the context, draw on his
experience, and make a considered judgment; or might he have felt
compelled to uncritically execute the recommendations made by the
system, which may well be indistinguishable in his mind to his own
judgments?]{.underline} In all three scenarios, [the human is less able
to exercise important human judgment at critical nuclear
flashpoints]{.underline}. A[lgorithmic bias, increased system fog, lack
of overall situational awareness, cognitive overload, and an accelerated
action chain are consequences of intricate human-machine teaming through
interfaces]{.underline}. This [blur]{.underline}ring of
[boundaries]{.underline} could [obscure where machine input starts and
human judgment ends]{.underline}. It could reduce the scope for
cognitive input from the human and increase the extent to which
algorithmic decisions prevail without serious oversight. Human
experience and foresight based on noncomputational parameters are likely
to be bracketed considerably. Is that wise in a nuclear context? [As
military operations prioritize speed and networked connectivity,
slotting the human into a computer interface in the nuclear context may
significantly exacerbate nuclear
instability]{.underline}.[^14^](https://www.armscontrol.org/taxonomy/term/84/3?page=1#endnote14)

#### The plan's collaboration over cognitive warfare reverses lack of cohesion

Recommendations for NATO The need for cooperation While [the objective
of Cognitive Warfare is to harm societies and not only the
military]{.underline}, this type of warfare [resembles to "shadow wars"
and requires a **whole-of-government approach**]{.underline} to warfare.
As previously stated, [the modern concept of war is]{.underline} not
about weapons but [about **influence**. To shape perceptions and control
the narrative during this type of war, battle will]{.underline} have to
[be fought in the cognitive domain with a whole-of-government approach
at the national level.]{.underline} [This will require improved
coordination between the use of force and the other levers of power
across government]{.underline}. This could mean changes to how defence
is resourced, equipped, and organised in order to offer military options
below the threshold of armed conflict and improve the military
contribution to resilience. [For **NATO**, the development of actions in
the cognitive domain]{.underline} also [requires a **sustained
cooperation** between Allies in order to ensure an overall
**coherence**, to build credibility and]{.underline} to [allow a
concerted defense]{.underline}. Within the military, expertise on
anthropology, ethnography, history, psychology among other areas will be
more than ever required to cooperate with the military, in order to
derive qualitative insights from quantitative data, as an example. In
other words, if the declaration of a new field of combat consecrates the
new importance of humans, it is more about rethinking the interaction
between the hard sciences and the social sciences. The rise of cognitive
technologies has endowed human with superior analysis and accuracy. In
order to deliver timely and robust decisions, it will not be a question
of relying solely on human cognitive capacities but of cross engineering
systems with social sciences (sociology, anthropology, criminology,
political science\...) in order to face complex and multifaceted
situations. The modelisation of human dynamics as part of what is known
as Computational Social Science will allow the use of knowledge from
social sciences and relating to the behaviour of social entities,
whether enemies or allies. By mapping the human environment, strategists
and key military leaders will be provided reliable information to decide
on the right strategy. Definition of the Human Domain Thus defined by
NATO's major adversaries, the mastery of the field of perceptions is an
abstract space where understanding of oneself (strengths and
weaknesses), of the other (adversary, enemy, human environment),
psychological dimension, intelligence collection, search for ascendancy
(influence, taking and conservation of the initiative) and capacity to
reduce the will of the adversary are mixed. Within the context of
multi-domain operations, the human domain is arguably the most important
domain, but it is often the most overlooked. Recent wars have shown the
inability to achieve the strategic goals (e.g. in Afghanistan) but also
to understand foreign and complex human environments. [Cognitive warfare
was forced upon the Western liberal democracies by challenging
international actors who have strategised to avoid the military
confrontation]{.underline}, thus [blurring the line between peace and
war by targeting the weakest element: humans]{.underline}. CW which
includes the increasing use of NBICs for military purposes may provide a
sure way of military dominance in a near future. "Military power is of
course one essential segment of security. But global security refers to
a broad range of threats, risks, policy responses that span political,
economic, societal, health (including cognitive health!) and
environmental dimensions, none of these being covered by your current
domains of operations! Some international actors already use weapons
that precisely target these dimensions, while keeping their traditional
kinetic arsenal in reserve as long as they possibly can. NATO, if it
wishes to survive, has to embrace this continuum and claim as its
responsibility, together with its allies to, seamlessly, achieve
superiority all across it."58 Raising awareness among Allies While
advances in technology have always resulted in changes in military
organisations and doctrines, [the rapid advancements in
technology]{.underline}, in particular in brain science and NBIC,
[should force NATO to take action and give]{.underline} a [greater
consideration to the emergence of the threats that represents Cognitive
Warfare]{.underline}. Not all NATO nations have recognised this changing
character of conflicts. **[Declaring the Human as sixth domain of
operations is a way to raise awareness among the NATO
Nations]{.underline}**. NATO should consider further integrating Human
situational awareness in the traditional situation awareness processes
of the Alliance. Anticipating the trends There is evidence that
[adversaries have already understood the **potential** of developing
human-related tech]{.underline}nologies. [Declaring the Human Domain as
a sixth domain of operations has the potential to reveal possible
vulnerabilities, which could otherwise amplify rapidly]{.underline}. It
is not too late to face the problem and help keep the dominance in the
field of cognition. The Human Domain of operations could tentatively be
defined as "the sphere of interest in which strategies and operations
can be designed and implemented that, by targeting the cognitive
capacities of individuals and/or communities with a set of specific
tools and techniques, in particular digital ones, will influence their
perception and tamper with their reasoning capacities, hence gaining
control of their decision making, perception and behaviour levers in
order to achieve desired effects." Delays in declaring the Human Domain
as a domain of operations may lead to fight the last war. Given that the
process of declaring a new domain of operations is a lengthy process and
given the sensitivity of the topic, [**NATO** needs to be **fast** in
focusing on political/military responses while capacity/threats of our
opponents are still **low**]{.underline}. Finally, ethical problems
should be raised. Since there is no agreed international legal framework
in the field of neurosciences, **[NATO]{.underline}** may [play a role
in pushing to establish an international legal framework that
meets]{.underline} the NATO Nations' [ethical standards]{.underline}.
Accelerating information sharing [Accelerated information sharing among
Alliance members]{.underline} may [help faster integration of
**interoperability**, to assure coherence across multi-domain
operations]{.underline}. Information sharing may also assist some
nations in catching up in this area. In particular, [surveillance
of]{.underline} ongoing [international activities in brain science,
and]{.underline} their [potential **dual-use**]{.underline} in military
[and intelligence operations should be undertaken and shared between
Allies]{.underline} along [with identification and quantification
of]{.underline} current and near-term [risks and threats]{.underline}
posed by such enterprises. Establishing DOTMLPFI components upstream The
first step is [to define the "human domain"]{.underline} in military
doctrine [and]{.underline} use the definition to conduct a full spectrum
of capability development analysis, [optimising the military for the
most likely]{.underline} 21st century [contingencies]{.underline}. Since
the Human Domain complements the five others, each capability
development should include the specificities of modern threats,
including those related to cognitive warfare and, more generally, the
sixth domain of operations. [The Human Domain is not an end]{.underline}
in itself [**but a means to achieve our strategic objectives** and to
respond to]{.underline} a type of [conflict]{.underline} that [the
military is not accustomed to dealing with]{.underline}. Dedication of
resources for developing and [sustaining NATO Nations capabilities to
prevent escalation of future risk and threat by]{.underline}: 1)
[continued surveillance]{.underline}; 2) [organisational and systemic
preparedness]{.underline}; 3) [coherence in]{.underline} any/[all
entities necessary to remain apace with]{.underline},
[and]{.underline}/[or ahead of tactical and strategic competitors' and
adversary's capabilities in this space]{.underline}. Impact on Warfare
Development By essence, defining a new domain of operations and all the
capabilities and concepts that go along with it, is part of ACT's
mission. Innovation Hub - Nov 2020 Page 34 of 45 ACT should lead a
further in-depth study with a focus on: • Advancements on brain science
initiatives that may be developed and used for nonkinetic and kinetic
engagements. • Different ethical systems that govern neuroscientific
research and development. This will mandate a rigorous, more granular,
and dialectical approach to negotiate and resolve issues and domains of
ethical dissonance in multi- and international biosecurity discourses. •
Ongoing review and evaluation of national intellectual property laws,
both in relation to international law(s), and in scrutiny of potential
commercial veiling of dual-use enterprises. • Identification and
quantification of current and near-term risks and threats posed by such
enterprise(s) • Better recognizing the use of social and human sciences
in relation with "hard" sciences to better understand the human
environment (internal and external) • Include the cognitive dimension in
every NATO exercises by leveraging new tools and techniques such as
immersive technologies Along with those studies, anticipating the first
response (such as the creation of a new NATO COE or rethink and adapt
the structure by strengthening branches as required) and defining a
common agreed taxonomy (Cognitive Dominance/Superiority/Cognitive Center
of Gravity etc...) will be key tasks for ACT to help NATO keep the
military edge. Innovation Hub - Nov 2020 Page 35 of 45 Conclusion
[Failing to thwart]{.underline} the [cognitive efforts of NATO\'s
opponents would condemn Western liberal societies to **lose the next
war** without a fight]{.underline}. [If **NATO** fails to build a
**sustainable** and **proactive** basis for progress in the cognitive
domain, it may have **no** **other option** than **kinetic
conflict**]{.underline}. Kinetic capabilities may dictate a tactical or
operational outcome, but [victory]{.underline} in the long run [will
remain solely dependent on the ability to influence, affect, change or
impact the cognitive domain]{.underline}. [Because]{.underline} the
factors that affect the [cognitive domain can be involved in all aspects
of human society through]{.underline} the areas of [will, concept,
psychology and thinking among other, so that particular kind of warfare
penetrates into all fields of society]{.underline}. It can be foreseen
that the [future information warfare will **start** from the cognitive
domain first, to **seize** the political and diplomatic strategic
initiative, but]{.underline} it will [also **end** in the cognitive
realm]{.underline}. Preparing for high-intensity warfare remains highly
relevant, but international actors providing NATO with specific
strategic security challenges have strategised to avoid confronting NATO
in kinetic conflicts and chose an indirect form of warfare[. Information
plays a key role in]{.underline} this [indirect form of warfare but the
advent of cognitive warfare is different]{.underline} from simple
Information Warfare[**: it is a war through information**, the real
target being the human mind]{.underline}, and beyond the human per se.
Moreover, progresses in NBIC make it possible to extend propaganda and
influencing strategies. The sophistication of NBIC-fueled hybrid attacks
today represent an unprecedented level of threat inasmuch they target
the most vital infrastructure everyone relies on: the human mind . 59
**[Cognitive warfare may well be the missing element that allows the
transition from military victory on the battlefield to lasting political
success]{.underline}**. The human domain might well be the decisive
domain, wherein multi-domain operations achieve the commander\'s effect.
The five first domains can give tactical and operational victories; only
the human domain can achieve the final and full victory. \"Recognising
the human domain and generating concepts and capabilities to gain
advantage therein would be a disruptive innovation."60

[Advances in materials, information systems and]{.underline} the [human
sciences]{.underline} are [setting]{.underline} the [stage to
significantly enhance human capabilities, pushing the physiological,
cognitive and social human performance frontiers]{.underline}.
[R&D]{.underline} in these areas is [enabled by rapid parallel
developments]{.underline} in RAS, AI, BDAA, miniaturisation and
innovative materials/manufacturing. As a result, BHET developments are
moving at a breathtaking rate, driven by research breakthroughs (e.g.
the discovery of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene editing \[395\]), substantial
national investments and increasing commercial interest. [The limits on
development are around the need for baseline research, as well as
**ethical, legal and policy concerns**.]{.underline} In particular,
[there are serious issues around the use of genetic engineering; the
**release of personal bio-data**; use of **pharmacological
enhancements**; and, **ethical testing** of **new therapeutic**s and
**countermeasures**]{.underline}. Figure G.1: Bioinformatics.
[Bioinformatics, and the related field of computational biology is
concerned with the storage, retrieval, organisation and analysis of
biological data]{.underline}, and in particular that associated with
humans or human activity. The [processing]{.underline} of such large
volumes of data [available for exploitation]{.underline} and assessment
(often in real-time) has [enabled]{.underline} a much greater
understanding of biological, biochemical, physiological, cognitive and
social behaviours. In turn, this has supported new technological
developments in medicine, genetics and biology. Especially over the last
15 years, bioinformatics has transformed the biological sciences to the
point where: "It might be that a new, "theoretical biology" is emerging,
where models and their predictions can now be assessed by [experimental
biology]{.underline}, in analogy to the interplay between theoretical
and experimental physics. This moment might have come faster than
expected. The [merging of computation into the fabric of biosciences and
biomedicine by 2020 \...will possibly necessitate a redefinition of
computational biology as a distinct discipline in the not-so-distant
future]{.underline}." \[396\]. Developments in biosensors (especially
cheap and widely available ones) have significantly contributed to this
data explosion. [Biosensors are devices that measure biological
(immunological, pressure, thermal, etc.) or biochemical processes and
convert them into an electrical signal]{.underline}. These are widely
used today and come in many forms. They may be employed for many
purposes, such as nano-sensors embedded in smart clothing for detection
of CBRN agents; treatment monitoring (e.g. diabetes); silicon photonic
biosensors (e.g. fibre Bragg gratings \[397\]); rapidly applied tattoos
to monitor physiological or cognitive stress \[398\]; and in support of
biomedical research \[399\]. Human physiological monitoring technologies
are already commercially available and more advanced sensor packages
will mature in the midterm. Advances and technological convergence in
material, information and human sciences are allowing new cheaper,
smaller and more robust biosensors to be developed. S&T development in
bioinformatics and biosensors, as they related to NATO capabilities,
will be predominately around their novel use, application of new
analytical methods (e.g. AI, quantum 96 Chapter G. Biotechnology & Human
Enhancement biology \[400\], new sensors (in vivo / ex vivo) and the
identification of new biomarkers). This continued development will
support predictive combat casualty care and diagnostics; operational
readiness (e.g. over-training, nutritional deficiencies,
immunocompetence, cardiac health and muscular-skeletal injury); and
assessment of CBRN exposure. Figure G.2: The Future Soldier (CREDIT:
USARMY/DARPA). State-of-the-art sensors are typically designed for
optimal detection only. As an example, terrorism threats and military
conflicts have motivated research in novel sensors for detecting
explosives and chemical warfare agents (CWAs). The focus of today's
research on (bio)sensors goes far beyond the optimisation of the sensing
material; it includes the ability to make decisions and act -- smart
sensing. Research in this area includes the application of \[401\]:
sensor material designs employing carbon nanotubes, polymer nanowires,
and porous silicon; machine learning, and DNA-based molecular computing
for smart biosensor function; and, bioelectronics and neuroelectronics,
such as nerve cell microelectrode arrays for creating novel transducers
and physiological biosensors. Enhanced bioinformatics and biosensors
will improve monitoring and bio-situational awareness through the
application of advanced data collection and predictive analytics.
Leveraging such techniques will support improved military health,
operational readiness and training, through predictive and pre-emptive
responses to environmental or individual issues \[202\]. Human
augmentation, human enhancement or soldier systems are broadly
understood to mean technologies used to improve human form or to
function beyond what is necessary to restore or sustain health.
Concerning BHET relevant to NATO, we take these to cover the range of
human domains - physiological, cognitive & social, and the use of
robotic exoskeletons, smart textiles, drugs, and seamless man-machine
interfaces. The development of new human augmentation technologies
(physical, pharmacological, neurological or social) has the potential to
change the capabilities of the individual soldier, sailor or aviator
significantly \[402, 403, 404, 405, 406\] and create integrated
human-machine symbiotes of unparalleled capabilities. Examples of such
augmentation across a variety of sensory modalities are \[402\]: •
Ocular enhancements to imaging, sight, and situational awareness through
implants, glasses or contact lens. These visual enhancements will
support team data sharing; enhanced target identification; man-machine
teaming; and, expansion of vision beyond the visible spectrum \[407\]: •
Restoration and programmed muscular control through an optogenetic
bodysuit sensor web; • Auditory enhancement for communication and
protection; and, • Direct neural enhancement of the human brain for
two-way data transfer. The first three of these technologies are
expected to be widely available within the next 20 years. The last,
direct neural enhancement, is potentially the most disruptive but is
also unlikely to be widely available before 2050, putting it outside the
scope of this study. Nevertheless, the development of direct
neural-silica connections supporting bi-directional data transfer and
mesh networks are a real possibility. Given recent advances in
understanding the brain's neurological components and cognitive
architecture, 97 neuroelectronic components that can efficiently
implement brain-like algorithms and interface directly with biological
wetware offer possibilities for new technological capabilities that
could significantly impact both the civilian and military domains. Very
high speed, very low power neuromorphic electronic components that
feature non-von Neumann architectures and analogue-like processors offer
the possibility of autonomous systems and heterogeneous computer
architectures that incorporate these devices. Such systems would be able
to perform tasks that the brain excels at but which currently thwart
classical computers, such as extensive heterogeneous data analysis and
visual scene processing. Interfacing these devices with biological
systems will offer new treatment methods for neurological diseases and
improved interface mechanisms between the brain and electronic devices
for better control of artificial limbs. In the near term, significant
changes in advancing heads-up displays over the past five years will be
refined to offer: • Improvements in the power efficiency of
micro-displays; • Advancements in optical fabrication techniques for
free-form optical surfaces; and • Integration and proliferation of
smartphones and wireless data links. The broad deployment of
exoskeletons in commercial sectors will probably remain quite limited
for the short term, due to their high cost (more than \$25,000 per
suit). Nevertheless, "it's clear that the era of the exoskeleton has
begun" \[408\] in areas such as logistics (e.g. warehouses),
construction and manufacturing (e.g. cars and aviation) to ease worker
burden, improve efficiency and reduce injuries. It is predicted that by
2025 the exoskeleton market will be 1.8 billion USD, up from 68 million
USD in 2014 \[409\]. The US Army and others are moving forward quickly
with development and exploring the operational effectiveness of
exoskeletons in theatre \[410, 411\]. Figure G.3: Future Gear. Other
methods of human augmentation include the development of new
physiological and pharmacological cognitive (PCE) enhancements, with
attendant reproducibility, medical, ethical, legal and policy
considerations (e.g. \[412, 413\]). Direct peripheral nerve stimulation
and other non-invasive methods may also be used to increase synaptic
plasticity for improved cognitive performance and learning \[202\],
supporting rapid and practical training of military personnel in complex
multi-faceted tasks. Ethical, legal, and policy issues arise around the
entire spectrum of human enhancement technologies, but especially with
pharmacological enhancements. As noted by \[414\]: "[Militaries have
long sought to enhance the physical and cognitive performance of
warfighters directly, and indeed some human performance enhancement
drugs are widely used across the US military today, such as
caffeine]{.underline}. Existing technologies have demonstrated the
ability to improve individual physical and cognitive performance above
baseline levels and in key areas central to military competition:
strength, focus, attention, learning, and resistance to fatigue. Many of
these technologies are already being used in civilian settings, in licit
or illicit contexts." Mixed reality, is another example of human
augmentation, blending the real and virtual worlds to create new digital
or manufactured realities, where physical and digital objects co-exist
and interact in real-time. Applications include heads up or head-mounted
displays for pilots and soldiers for real-time situational awareness,
digital cockpits/windows, realistic training environments or providing
hands-free job performance aids. Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality
are subsets of Mixed Reality. Computer 98 Chapter G. Biotechnology &
Human Enhancement simulation models are often used to deliver these
experiences. Recent attempts at large-scale commercial product releases
for head-worn, see-through, virtual displays have reopened interest in
the use of head or body-worn virtual displays. Figure G.4: Visual
Enhancement. Reference \[402\] notes that these technologies will
rapidly mature over the next 20 year and be primarily driven by the
commercial market. This bio-economy is already at the earliest stages of
development (e.g. Google glasses \[415\]), while the pharmaceutical
industry is one of the world's most significant contributing over 200M
euro to the EU economy alone. The social domain is an essential element
of human existence, and technology has provided social enhancement
technologies in the form of social networks and media. A social network
is a network of social interactions and personal relations. Social media
is a set of mediums that can be used for social networking. Social media
and networks have helped reshape the social, economic and political
world over the last 15 years \[416, 417\], with over 3.5 billion daily
users (45% of the world's population). Social media has been embraced
widely and quickly, and it has gained tremendous power to affect the
perceptions and behaviours of individuals and societies. As such, it has
become critical for the defence, security and safety of the Alliance,
and it is the prime human-terrain for operations in the
cyber/information domain. The amount and variety of social media
(whether text, audio, photographic or video in nature) is immense and
growing at an astounding rate. Although social media is a product of the
Internet era and most notably the 21st Century, the research on social
networks predates the internet by a wide margin. One of the first major
social networking studies in the 20th Century resulted in the Six
Degrees of Separation (SDS) Theory, first proposed by Frigyes Karinthy
in 1929. In 2008, well after the advent of the internet, Microsoft
conducted a study demonstrating that the average e-mail chain length was
6.6 hops. However, in 2016, researchers at Facebook reported that social
networking had reduced the chain length to three and a half degrees of
separation. As such, social media and social networks may be best
understood as a means for human social augmentation, and they have been
highly successful at it. Figure G.5: Social Augmentation and
Enhancement. The growth of the global information network presents
significant challenges in understanding dynamic information flows within
the network, and the associated velocity, variety and veracity
challenges. Understanding the dynamics and spread of information,
whether, by individuals, groups, societies or states, within social
networks is essential to our understanding of weaponised information and
the role this plays in hybrid warfare \[418\]. Understanding how this
dynamic may be exploited is of considerable commercial (e.g. Google,
Facebook, Amazon, etc.) and military interest \[26, 202\]. The
development of new Medical countermeasures and more generally Biomedical
Technologies pulls together and applies parallel developments in
bioinformatics, biosensors, human augmentation and synthetic biology.
For example, applied research in casualty care and neural interfaces
will help to support evidence-based medicine, operational readiness,
increased immunocompetence, disease/biothreat forecasting & detection,
patient-centric medicine, rapid development of CBRN countermeasures,
improve rehabilitation through new neural interfaces & AI-enabled
robotic prosthetic limb technology, and provide new diagnostic and
treatment options for mTBI (mild traumatic brain injury) and PSTD
(post-traumatic 99 stress disorder) \[202\]. Figure G.6: Casualty Care.
Combat casualty care may also be significantly enhanced through the use
of improved bioinformatics and biosensors, remote monitoring, molecular
& cellular biology, AI for rapid diagnostics, bioinformatics, surgical
techniques & tools, novel materials to improve rapid identification, and
treatment of tissue damage and infection. These technologies have the
potential to reduce significantly mortality and morbidity resulting from
injuries on the battlefield, improve the efficacy of follow-on care and
enhance rehabilitation efforts. Fundamental research is also ongoing in
understanding the dynamics of complex biological systems, such as the
human biome. Research is focused on understanding complex dynamical
biological systems-of-systems and developing mechanisms for assessment
and optimal control \[202\]. Synthetic biology involves the precise
genetic manipulation and engineering of organisms for scientific
research and the development of unique characteristics and capabilities
not seen in nature. Furthermore, synthetic biological processes can
yield new organic molecules, novel materials that cannot be manufactured
directly or even new bio-manufacturing paradigms. Synthetic biology
builds upon a human tradition of genetic manipulation (e.g. crop
breeding, domestication, etc.). Still, it has begun to evolve very
rapidly due to the confluence of molecular biology, systems engineering,
information science and other emergent technical fields. The complex
convergence of several fundamental technical domains such as molecular
biology, systems engineering, etc. precludes a concise and comprehensive
characterisation of all relevant and enabling science and technology
involved in the field of synthetic biology. Synthetic biology is not a
single technology but rather an integrated environment of synergistic
technologies (e.g. CRISPR/Cas9 \[419\]) involved in the manipulation of
DNA sequences and exploitation of the resulting complex molecules. The
latter involves specialised bio and chemical engineering for scaling
biological processes to produce meaningful quantities of new organisms
and their products. The former includes the involvement of data and
information sciences to architect new molecules. The technologies
involved in synthetic biology are globally becoming more advanced and
refined as both public and private sector investment are increasingly
applied to this field in pursuit of both economic and national security
objectives. Figure G.7: DNA. Biological engineering is a developing area
of research that holds significant promise. The goal of biological
engineering is the design and construction of multi-cellular biological
systems or systems-of-systems, including the use of AI and genetic
design. The goal is to create biological materials with engineered
properties. Developments in this area include AI optimised xenobots (i.e
specialised bio-robots) for nano-scale manufacturing \[420, 421\] and
living bio-sensors (e.g. persistent living aquatic or terrestrial
sensors, or CBRN monitoring) \[202\]. The scope and magnitude of the
future contributions that synthetic biology will make to civil and
national security sectors are currently quite speculative; however,
there is little doubt that this technology domain will have substantive
impacts wherever it is applied or exploited. Examples of practical
applications of synthetic biology are the development of new
macro-phages \[422\], plants, insects \[423\], viruses constructed
batteries \[104\] and xeno-bots for nano-scale manufacturing \[420,
421\]. Nevertheless, there remain many technical barriers to be overcome
in order to realise its full hypothesised potential as well 100 Chapter
G. Biotechnology & Human Enhancement as many ethical and institutional
challenges to be mitigated. The broad global awareness and proliferation
of the underlying enabling technologies for synthetic biology largely
preclude its comprehensive control; potential adversaries and economic
competitors can be expected to have few, if any barriers, to its
exploitation for their national or organisational objectives.
Biotechnology, nanotechnology and genomics are advancing rapidly in the
short to midterm. These advances are mostly driven by the private sector
but can easily be transferred to the military sector where appropriate.
[MILITARY IMPLICATIONS]{.underline} BLUE BHET are expected to create
disruption in: 1. [Readiness: Use of biomarkers (phenotypic and genetic)
for predictive diagnostics will enable predeployment identification of
medical issues or weaknesses]{.underline} (e.g. muscular-skeletal,
psychological, immunological, physiological or nutritional). Improved
diagnosis and novel countermeasures will result in increased
occupational readiness and effectiveness for forces in high-risk
high-threat environments. Human state monitoring in real-time to near
real-time will allow individual and team performance to be optimised. 2.
Operations: Wearable biomedical systems that provide the ability to
monitor soldier health continuously could provide knowledge of the
inception and progress of injury over time. Knowledge of the health
status of soldiers on the battlefield could be of great benefit for BLUE
forces in providing essential information needed for force condition
status assessment. Forces, leveraging bioinformatics, sensors and
enhancement technologies, should be able to operate in smaller groups,
which has implications on affordability (i.e. a smaller number of
soldiers, sailors or aviators can achieve similar results). Virtual
reality and ultimately, neural interfaces will support significant
improvements in situational awareness and operations of autonomous
systems. Heads up displays, currently used in aviation and to a lesser
extent in automobiles, could also find uses in dismounted soldier
systems. Heads-up, eyes-out targeting could be achieved by overlaying
targeting symbols on top of real-world targets. Mixed reality could be
used to assist planners and mission rehearsal. Immersive visualisation
of rapidly generated accurate 3D representations of the physical
environment (terrain + buildings + infrastructure) from open source and
military data and observations could provide staff with a realistic feel
for the terrain before being exposed to it in real life. Mixed Reality
setups are already used to provide practical, cost-effective training
environments. Advances in computer networking, processing and analytics
will see such setups used in the battlefield as well as expensive labs.
Neurological interfaces will increase response times, situational
awareness and the effectiveness of man-machine teaming. 3. Medical
Countermeasures and Care: Use of biomarkers, biosensors (in vivo & in
vitro) \[424\] and microarrays (microfluidic devices integrating
computing chips with living cells and tissue) will allow rapid
(pre-symptomatic) diagnosis and response to synthetic or natural
pathogens, chemicals, as well as real-time monitoring of treatment
options. Use of biomarkers, novel pharmaceuticals, gene therapy and
bio-engineering (e.g. robotics, prosthesis, neural interfaces, etc.)
will dramatically increase the effectiveness of combat casualty care and
rehabilitation, especially in such areas as post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), environmental exposure and mild-traumatic brain injury
(mTBI). 4. Performance: Rapid advances in material, computer and human
sciences, as well as convergence between these fields, is setting the
stage to enhance human capabilities and push the human performance
frontiers significantly. Optimising the performance of each individual,
be it in the cognitive, physical or resilience domains, in addition to
improving team cohesiveness and effectiveness, will enable Alliance
forces to make better decisions faster, and can produce actions better
tuned to 101 the needs of the situation. Current and future advances in
physiological and psychological state monitoring will maximise overall
human performance and readiness through specific user group algorithm
applications. Benefits include better leadership assessment of force
status; increased training program adaptation and effectiveness through
real-time performance metrics; and increased health and safety
monitoring as well as injury protection. Bioinformatics and biosensors,
along with increased use of personalised and virtualised training, will
improve training effectiveness. Muscular-skeletal augmentation (e.g.
exoskeletons) will increase load carrying capacity during operations,
reduce debilitating injuries and increase combat performance. 5. Social
Networks: Social media supports military activities in six key ways
\[26\]: intelligence collection; (geo-) targeting; cyber operations;
command and control; defense; and, psychological warfare (inform and
influence). Fusing social media (as part of OSINT (open-source
intelligence)) with other data, and integrating social network
operations into broader operational and strategic actions will be a
critical success factor in countering hybrid and memetic warfare
operations. RED BHET threats will increase driven, in no small measure
by, the democratisation of associated technologies. Significant Alliance
ethical, legal and policy are not shared by a peer or near-peer
strategic threats. However, more worrisome perhaps, will be their use by
security threats (both criminal and otherwise) or the use of
non-sanctioned enhancements by individuals. With globalisation and the
increased pace of scientific discoveries, there is a high likelihood
that an adversary force will have access to the knowledge necessary to
create similar capabilities. The implications on the battlefield are
that RED would have a significant performance advantage if such a force
is not constrained by the same ethical considerations in implementing
these new technologies. In particular: 1. Synthetic Biology: New
pathogens, novel biological agents or chemical agents, with explicitly
engineered and targeted effects (e.g. increased virulence, physical,
neurological or physiological impact, genetic susceptibility, etc.),
will potentially increase casualties, reduce combat effectiveness and
present a strategic challenge to Alliance societies as a whole. The
impact of unknown biological agents will challenge the capacity of
medical and logistics systems to cope, while countermeasures themselves
may present significant health and safety challenges. 2. Designer
Pharmaceuticals: Criminal and non-state actors will increasingly have
the ability to develop low cost targeted pharmacological agents. These
may be used to explicitly to disrupt Alliance operations or destabilise
alliance societies through targeted psycho-social effects. 3.
Super-Soldiers: BHET will enable pharmacologically, neurologically and
physiologically enhanced opponents. In combination with more effective
partnering with autonomous and semiautonomous systems, these will
significantly challenge Alliance forces, force structure and
effectiveness. Interoperability [Alliance interoperability will be
challenged by differing legal, policy, training, operational
effectiveness and ethical standards amongst the nations driven by BHET.

The conservative case for NATO is not that it strengthens liberal world
order. Rather, the conservative case for NATO is that it bolsters
American national interests. [In an age of **great-power
competition**]{.underline}, as identified by the Trump administration,
[America's **Western alliance** provides the U.S. with **some dramatic
comparative advantages**. The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
[Canada, and]{.underline} their [Europe]{.underline}an allies
[have]{.underline} a number of **[common interests]{.underline}** and
common challenges [with]{.underline} regard to Beijing, Moscow,
[**terrorism**, **cyberattacks**, **migration**, **nuclear weapons**,
and **military readiness**. NATO is **the one formal alliance** that
allows for **cooperation** on these matters]{.underline}. It is also the
only alliance that embodies America's civilizational ties with Europe
--- a point forcefully made by President Trump when he visited Poland in
2017. Properly understood, [NATO]{.underline} helps [keeps **America's
strategic competitors**]{.underline} at bay, [pushing back on **Russian
and Chinese influence**]{.underline}. In all of these ways, the U.S.
alliance system in [Europe is]{.underline} a bit [like **oxygen**.

[Cognitive warfare pursues the objective of undermining
trust]{.underline} (public trust in electoral processes, trust in
institutions, allies, politicians...). , [therefore the individual
becomes the]{.underline} 5 **[weapon]{.underline}**, while [the goal
is]{.underline} not [to attack]{.underline} what individuals think but
rather **[the way they think]{.underline}** .6 It **[has the potential
to unravel the entire social contract that underpins
societies]{.underline}**. It is natural to trust the senses, to believe
what is seen and read. But the democratisation of automated tools and
techniques using AI, no longer requiring a technological background,
enables anyone to distort information and to further undermine trust in
open societies. The use of fake news, deep fakes, Trojan horses, and
digital avatars will create new suspicions which anyone can exploit.
**[It is easier and cheaper for adversaries to undermine trust in our
own systems than to attack our power grids, factories or military
compounds]{.underline}**. Hence, it is likely that in the near future
there will be more attacks, from a growing and much more diverse number
of potential players with a greater risk for escalation or
miscalculation. The characteristics of cyberspace (lack of regulation,
difficulties and associated risks of attribution of attacks in
particular) mean that new actors, either state or non-state, are to be
expected . 7 As the example of COVID-19 shows, the massive amount of
texts on the subject, including deliberately biased texts (example is
the Lancet study on chloroquine) created an information and knowledge
overload which, in turn, generates both a loss of credibility and a need
for closure. Therefore **[the ability for humans to question, normally,
any data/information presented is hampered, with a tendency to fall back
on biases to the detriment of unfettered decision-making]{.underline}**.
It applies to trust among individuals as well as groups, political
alliances and societies. "[Trust]{.underline}, in particular among
allies, **[is a targeted vulnerability]{.underline}**. As any
international institution does, [NATO relies on trust]{.underline}
between its partners. [Trust is]{.underline} based not only on
respecting some explicit and tangible agreements, but also on 'invisible
contracts,' on sharing values, which is [not easy when such a proportion
of allied nations have been fighting each other for centuries. This has
left **wounds and scars** creating a **cognitive/information** landscape
that our adversaries study with great care]{.underline}. [Their
objective is to identify the 'Cognitive Centers of Gravity' of the
Alliance, which they will target with 'info-weapons'.]{.underline}

The **[increasingly]{.underline}** globalized, distributed, and
[**dispersed nature** of synthetic biology **products** and **research**
worsens **challenges** arising from **differing practices** of
biosecurity governance globally]{.underline}. [Advanced biological
research is no longer **overwhelmingly dominated** by **Europe** and the
**US**]{.underline}, and [this may introduce different approaches to or
priorities for biosecurity]{.underline}. For instance, [Russia's Federal
Research Programme for Genetic Technologies Development]{.underline} for
2019--2027 [intends to "implement a comprehensive solution to the task
of the accelerated development of genetic technologies]{.underline},
including genetic editing[; to establish scientifc and technological
groundwork for medicine, agriculture and industry]{.underline}; to
improve the system of preventing biological emergencies and monitoring
in this area." Similarly, [Saudi Arabia is funding research related to
the development of microbial cell factories to produce fuels and
chemicals]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the [Singaporean
government]{.underline} is [investing considerable resources
into]{.underline} the [funding of life and environmental sciences
research at Nanyang]{.underline} Technological University, the [National
University of Singapore, and the Agency for Science, Technology and
Research]{.underline} (A\*STAR). The [Chinese Academy of
Sciences]{.underline} is esta[blishing an Institute of Synthetic
Biology]{.underline}, which is [tasked with]{.underline} the [dual
responsibilities of fostering roadmaps]{.underline} for the future
development of Chinese synthetic biology while also establishing safety
and security norms for researchers at Chinese institutions. [There are
no top-down efforts beyond existing mechanisms]{.underline} like the BWC
or the CWC to B. D. Trump et al. 223 standardize global governance and
usage of synthetic biology, and bottom-up efforts are not coordinated in
their reach or messaging. [Relative newcomers to synthetic biology
development may possess differing tolerances and constructions of risk
than more established technology developers. The implications, though
vast, can be grouped into two general areas]{.underline}. One includes
[**diverging safety and security practices** at various points of an
international supply chain that forms the backbone of an increasingly
globalized economy]{.underline}. [Another includes the **potential** for
**small-scale experiments** or **national biosecurity policies** to
escape a given actor's control and **spill across** **political
boundaries**]{.underline}. While one country may find [the]{.underline}
environmental risk of a particular [synthetic biology
application]{.underline} acceptable, its [spread across borders into
another country may disrupt those **local** ecologies (i.e.,
**crashing** or **hardening** a particular species through genetic
engineering) or expose **vulnerable human populations** to
**irreversible consequences** without options for
amelioration]{.underline}. The nature of [certain synthetic biology
applications]{.underline} (i.e. gene drives) makes it [impossible for
risk averse countries to wholly quarantine themselves from exposure to
harms resulting from another country's decisions]{.underline}. This is
also an issue of equity because [risk-tolerant countries will reap the
rewards when beneficial technologies emerge]{.underline}, but
[risk-averse countries may be forced to bear their neighbors' risks
without any means to capture potential rewards]{.underline}. An
environment of [**competing** and **incongruent risk architectures**
causes **individual states**, organizations, or industries to arrive at
**differing definitions** of security threats or acceptable levels of
loss in pursuit of a technology's intended gains. For a technology as
**uncertain** as **synthetic biology**, this policy **divergence** may
set governments, companies, and other research organizations **down
vastly differing policy paths**, and impede consensus in assessing the
minutiae of technical risk concerns or assessment protocols, or ensuring
security for anyone]{.underline}.

**[diseases]{.underline}** (Fusarium spp., Tilletia spp.), viral

research on possible bioweapons applications of a variety of fungal
diseases of important food crops (wheat stem rust, rice blast), viral
and bacterial diseases of domesticated livestock (e.g., anthrax,
tularemia, malignant catarrhal fever), and insect disease vectors
(mosquitoes, ticks, fleas) (Bozheyeva et al. 1999). The Soviet
bioweapons program tested plant and livestock bioweapon diseases for
potential deployment, with the goal of disrupting food production and
food processing infrastructures and damaging the agricultural sector of
national economies (Alibek and Handelman 2000). Soviet scientists
reportedly used newly developed genetic engineering techniques to create
vaccine-subverting and antibiotic-resistant strains of anthrax, plague,
tularemia, and smallpox for attacks against military forces and civilian
populations (Bozheyeva et al. 1999, Alibek and Handelman 2000). Most,
perhaps even all, of the cultivated and potentially weaponized diseases
identified by the Office International des Epizooties as possible major
threats to livestock and wildlife species (FMD, rinderpest, Newcastle
disease, African swine fever, sheep pox, and Rift Valley fever; OIE
2001) were experimentally tested for bioweapons applications under the
Soviet bioweapons research and development program (Bozheyeva et al.
1999, Kortepeter et al. 2001) Countries believed to have active
biowarfare research programs during recent years include some former
USSR states (i.e., Russia, Kazakstan), Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, North
Korea, Israel, Egypt, Taiwan, China, South Africa, Libya, Cuba, Romania,
Bulgaria, Pakistan, India, United Kingdom, France, Germany, the
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United States (Leitenberg 2000).
Several major international terrorist organizations, including but not
restricted to the Al Qaeda network, are believed to have the financial
resources and political contacts needed to access state-of-the-art
bioweapon disease cultures and production technologies. Aum Shinrikyo, a
Japanese terrorist group that used sarin gas for a terrorist attack on
the Tokyo subway system, was also involved in developing terrorist
bioweapons employing anthrax spores, botulism toxin, Q fever, and Ebola
virus (Christopher et al. 1997). Recent **[advances in molecular biology

(Jackson et al. 2001). Threats to biodiversity and endangered species
There is a growing but still insufficient scientific recognition of the
importance of disease control for the conservation of biodiversity and
endangered species populations (Daszak et al. 2000). Organisms that are
relatively benign in their natural hosts can cause fatal diseases in
other species. Cross-species infections with human herpes simplex Type 1
may be fatal for New World marmosets (Callithrixspp.), and an apparently
benign herpes virus of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) causes a
fatal systemic disease in Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) (Richman et
al. 1999). Saprolegnia ferox, a common oomycete disease of
hatchery-reared fishes, has been implicated as a factor in
disease-related population declines of amphibians in northwestern North
America (Kiesecker et al. 2001). Avian malaria and avian pox have been
implicated in the extinctions of native bird species in Hawaii, and
MacPhee and Marx (1997) suggest that diseases introduced through humans
and human commensals may have been a factor in prehistoric mass
extinctions of wildlife species in Madagascar and North America. The
**[use of biological weapons against livestock]{.underline}**
populations **[or]{.underline}** agricultural **[crops]{.underline}**
could **[have]{.underline}** potentially disastrous **[spillover effects
on wild species of plants and animals]{.underline}** (Brown 1999, Daszak
et al. 2000). **[Many]{.underline}** of the currently **[available
bioweapon pathogens are]{.underline}** broad-spectrum diseases that are
**[capable of causing]{.underline}** high levels of mortality or
**[morbidity among wild and domesticated]{.underline}** species of
**[animals]{.underline}**, as well as human beings (figure 1). Three of
the four genetically modified pathogens created specifically for
bioweapon attacks against human populations are zoonotic diseases whose
release into the environment may pose both direct and indirect threats
to wildlife populations (i.e., anthrax, plague, tularemia; Alibek and
Handelman 2000). Virulent strains of natural disease pathogens known to
have been cultured and tested for bioweapon attacks against domesticated
livestock (e.g., rinderpest, FMD, brucellosis) could have potentially
devastating effects on naive and susceptible populations of susceptible
wild ungulates. The Great African Rinderpest epizootic of a century ago
provides a useful model for predicting the potential effects of the
proliferation of highly virulent and contagious bioweapon diseases on
susceptible wildlife and livestock species. Rinderpest virus was
introduced into Africa in 1887 through cattle imported to Abyssinia (now
Ethiopia) from India to provision European colonial armies. The
subsequent epidemic outbreak of rinderpest that began in 1889 swept from
the Horn of Africa to the southern cape in less than a decade,
exhibiting an effective average dispersal rate of approximately 3 km per
day during an era predating automobiles and aircraft. The rinderpest
panzootic proliferated rapidly among native African cattle breeds and
susceptible wild ungulate species, killing an estimated 90% to 95% of
the cattle, African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), and wildebeest
(Connochaetes taurinus) in East Africa within 3 years of its first
appearance in the region (Daszak et al. 2000). Cattle populations were
devastated and African buffalo extirpated from most of their range in
southern and eastern Africa. The African buffalo, formerly the most
characteristic and abundant ungulate of the African plains, was reduced
to a few small, scattered relict herds (Sinclair 1979). Despite
intensive control efforts over the past century, rinderpest is still
enzootic within East Africa, with periodic outbreaks occurring among
livestock and wildlife populations in the region (Dobson 1994). The
importance of buffalo as a food resource for African hunter--gatherer
societies was surpassed, however, by the immense importance of
domesticated cattle to pastoral and agricultural societies of eastern
and southern Africa. Cattle have served for centuries, and in some
instances perhaps millennia, as the principal source of food, wealth,
and motive energy for the Nilotic and Bantu peoples of eastern and
southern Africa. The rinderpest epidemic effectively dispossessed
indigenous African peoples of food resources, traditional livelihoods,
and wealth and property in ways that were potentially more disruptive to
traditional cultural milieus than the physical displacement from
traditional territories and the political and economic subjugation of
African peoples by European colonial administrations. Milk and meat from
cattle provide critically important sources of essential dietary protein
in African pastoral and agrarian societies (Holtzman 2001), while the
cattle themselves were (and still are throughout much of the continent)
important for the cultivation and fertilization of food crops and as the
principal real property assets of families living under communal or open
land-tenure systems. The Nilotic pastoral peoples of eastern Africa who
depended entirely or primarily on the blood and milk of cattle for
nutrition and subsistence were devastated by the rinderpest epidemic of
the 1890s; an estimated two-thirds of the Masai people of eastern Africa
starved to death during a single two-year period following the
destruction of their herds by rinderpest (Sinclair 1979). Traditional
cattle-raising and farming societies, such as the Sukuma and Samburu
peoples of eastern Africa and the Ndebele and Zulu peoples of southern
Africa, were also severely affected by the rinderpest epidemic. The
immediate social and economic effects of the 1889--1899 rinderpest
epidemic on the Bantu and Nilotic peoples of eastern and southern Africa
closely parallel the effects of the extirpation of the Plains bison
(Bison bison) on Native American peoples in the Great Plains region of
North America from 1870 to 1885. In evolutionary and ecological terms,
however, the impacts of the great rinderpest epidemic on African
ungulate faunas may have been surpassed by the effects of the chestnut
blight fungus (Cryphonectria parasitica, formerly Endothia parasitica)
on the temperate deciduous forest biome of eastern North America. The
American chestnut (C. dentata), once the dominant and most abundant tree
species of eastern North American forests, has been extirpated
throughout its range by the chestnut blight. Before disappearance, the
American chestnut was an important timber and fuelwood tree that
provided an abundant and high-quality food resource for wildlife,
livestock, and human populations throughout much of eastern North
America. Chestnut blight was first recorded in New York City in 1904,
presumably having been introduced along with Japanese chestnut trees (C.
crenata) imported as nursery stock. The chestnut blight spread at a rate
estimated at between 20--50 miles per year, reducing the American
chestnut to a state of virtual extinction throughout its range by 1950.
Current efforts to save the American chestnut from extinction focus on
biological control of the disease itself through a virulence-attenuating
virus and hybridization and backcrossing with a blight-resistant related
species, the Chinese chestnut (C. mollissima). The American elm (Ulmus
americana) is another characteristic and formerly common tree of eastern
North American landscapes that has also been driven to virtual
extinction by an introduced fungal pathogen, the Dutch elm disease
Ophiostoma (Ceratocystis) ulmi. A century later, New York City is the
apparent entry site for an emerging and potentially fatal disease of
humans and animals, the West Nile virus (WNV). The establishment and
spread of WNV in North America after its appearance in 1999 is perhaps
the best available modern example of the potential dispersal
capabilities of bioweapon diseases within and among human and animal
populations. The dispersion of WNV illustrates the immense (and in some
cases possibly insurmountable) difficulties in identifying and
controlling cryptic and potentially lethal zoonotic diseases. WNV is a
mosquito-transmitted disease of birds and mammals, including humans,
which causes high rates of mortality in some host species (Rappole et
al. 2000). Although WNV is primarily a disease of birds, mammals are
common secondary but dead-end hosts for this virus. WNV infections have
been reported from numerous species of both wild and domesticated
mammals (e.g., humans, horses, cats, bats, chipmunks, skunks, squirrels,
domestic rabbits, and raccoons). West Nile virus has become firmly
established in eastern North America during the past 3 years, and it
appears probable that migrating birds may ultimately spread the disease
throughout the Americas and the Caribbean. As of March 2002, WNV has
been confirmed in 27 states in the eastern United States, as well as in
Ontario (Canada) and the Cayman Islands (ERAP 2002). The history of
bovine tuberculosis and rinderpest in Africa and brucellosis in North
America shows that exotic diseases may be difficult or impossible to
eradicate once they have been introduced and have become established in
wild species within new localities. In the case of anthrax, the risk of
subsequent disease outbreaks within contaminated areas may continue for
decades and even centuries after the total eradication of hosts and
vectors: Viable, infectious anthrax bacilli have been cultured from
animal bones buried for 150 to 200 years in archeological sites (de Vos
1990, Dixon et al. 1999). Bioweapon diseases may spread faster and prove
much more difficult to suppress and eradicate than the historical
examples cited above might indicate, given the exceptional virulence and
environmental resilience of cultured bioweapon disease strains (Alibek
and Handelman 2000). Bioweapon threats to biodiversity **[Efforts to
control]{.underline}** human disease epidemics resulting from plague and
tularemia **[bioweapon attacks will need to take into account the
eradication of potential animal reservoirs and insect
vectors]{.underline}** once initial outbreaks among human populations
have been contained (Alibek and Handelman 2000). As potential disease
reservoirs, **[rare or endangered species populations within affected
areas may be subject to eradication as well]{.underline}**. Thus,
endangered species now restricted to a few relict and isolated
populations within highly urbanized landscapes (e.g., Stephen\'s
Kangagroo Rat, Dipodomys stephensi) could be at high risk for extinction
under such circumstances. It is worth noting in this context that an
extraordinarily high number of endangered and threatened species
(including D. stephensi) are now largely or entirely restricted to
habitats located in and around US military installations and military
training ranges, which could be potential targets of bioweapons attacks;
more than 220 federally listed threatened or endangered species have
been confirmed as residents or migrants on US military lands. Although
military lands represent only about 3% of all US federal lands, they
contain disproportionately high percentages of habitat for endangered
species of plants and animals (Leslie et al. 1996). Wild plant and
animal species that are naturally rare and species that have been
severely depleted in numbers from overharvesting or habitat degradation
are particularly susceptible to extinction by introduced diseases
(Dobson and May 1986). **[Diseases to which humans and human commensals
have developed immunity or high levels of resistance may cause
catastrophic mortality in naive and susceptible wildlife
populations]{.underline}**. Small absolute population sizes, inbreeding
depression, and exposure to exotic disease organisms are a potential
recipe for the extinction of endangered and threatened wildlife species
(Singer et al. 2001). There needs to be much wider recognition by
scientists and the public of the danger that diseases of domesticated
animals and humans pose for wildlife and endangered species populations,
and of the pivotal role of human interventions in fostering the
introduction and establishment of exotic diseases of plants and animals
to new areas (Dudley 1993, Daszak et al. 2000). Bioweapon applications
are only the most extreme example of the larger invasive species
problems associated with the introductions of exotic diseases and
organisms to new areas as the result of deliberate or inadvertent human
activities. The potentially devastating harm of even localized disease
outbreaks on endangered species is illustrated by the effects of canine
distemper on the North American black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes),
the Caspian seal (Phoca caspica), and the African wild dog (Lycaon
pictus). Canine distemper is a common viral disease of domesticated dogs
that can spill over into wildlife populations, with appalling results on
susceptible species of wild carnivores. Disturbingly, canine distemper
is also a disease that has been cultured and tested in bioweapon
laboratories (Kortepeter et al. 2001). During the past decade, canine
distemper outbreaks resulted in the extinction of the last known wild
population of the North American black-footed ferret and the African
wild dog population of the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania (Daszak
et al. 2000). Habitat loss and persecution, exacerbated by the effects
of canine distemper on ferrets and sylvatic plague on prey populations
(prairie dogs), caused the decline and ultimate extinction of
black-footed ferrets from their formerly vast range within the Great
Plains region of North America. Similarly, persecution and
predator-control operations have reduced the once widely distributed
African wild dog to a few small and scattered populations that are now
gravely threatened by spillover infections of canine distemper and
rabies from domestic dog populations (Ginsberg et al. 1995). An outbreak
of distemper in the Serengeti region of Tanzania during the early 1990s
caused the extirpation of the resident wild dog population and the death
of approximately one-third of the Serengeti\'s resident lion population.
The small resident population of endangered cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus)
could have been driven to the verge of extinction in the Serengeti had
they experienced rates of distemper morbidity and mortality comparable
to that observed among African wild dogs and lions at this site (Kelly
2001). Livestock breed conservation is important for the retention of
the genetic raw material for morphological and physiological adaptations
that may provide enhanced resistance to insects, parasites, and disease
and to the effects of climate, altitude, solar radiation, and other key
environmental factors. Worldwide, there are approximately 4000
recognized breeds and local breed varieties of the principal
domesticated livestock species (ass, cattle, water buffalo, pig, horse,
sheep, goats). This once great array of local and endemic livestock
breeds has been drastically eroded over the past century (Ruane 2000).
At least 700 of the surviving local and traditional breeds of these
seven livestock species, including 350 breeds in Europe alone, are in
imminent danger of disappearance because of the global emphasis on a few
highly cosmopolitan commercial breeds. Most remaining local livestock
breeds have critically small population sizes and highly localized
distributions, restricted in some instances to only one or two farms
located within a single village or township (Ruane 2000). Local breeds
often consist of highly inbred lines that may be susceptible to
extinction as the result of even an extremely localized disease outbreak
(Ruane 2000, Toro et al. 2000). News reports in March 2001 indicated
that at least one of England\'s relict endemic sheep breeds had been
condemned to extinction through sanitary slaughter as a consequence of
the recent FMD outbreak. In view of the potential effects of sanitary
slaughter on the maintenance of genetic diversity within rare livestock
breeds, the European Union and British government have now established
policies for exempting rare breeds from prohibitions on disease
vaccination and precautionary sanitary slaughter under certain
circumstances (DEFRA 2002). **[Some]{.underline}** **[diseases that
cause high rates of morbidity and mortality in humans or domesticated
animals may occur in wildlife species without manifesting clinical signs
of disease infection]{.underline}** (e.g., hantaviruses, Trypanosma
spp.). Control measures for zoonotic diseases may result in concerted
efforts to eradicate any and all wildlife species that may be potential
reservoirs, intermediate hosts, or vectors for disease transmission to
humans or domesticated animals. Containment of plague and tularemia
disease outbreaks resulting from bioweapon attacks will necessitate the
control or eradication of rodent populations within affected areas to
prevent the subsequent transmission of the disease from infected rodents
to humans (Alibek and Handelman 2000). Populations of many wildlife
species are already routinely subject to stringent control or local
extirpation in many areas to control the transmission of endemic
diseases to domesticated animals, in some instances without any
supporting evidence to validate the clinical efficacy of such efforts.
In the United States, programs to control brucellosis in cattle
populations have resulted in the culling or attempted eradication of
populations of bison (Bison bison), elk (Cervus canadensis), and
whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginiana). Other examples of such control
programs include the routine culling of wild boar (Sus scrofa)
populations in several European countries to control the transmission of
classical swine fever to domesticated swine. Rabies control programs
target populations of red fox (Vulpes vulpes) in Europe and North
America, jackals (Canis mesomelas) in eastern and southern Africa,
raccoons (Procyon lotor) in southern and eastern North America. In
Central and South America, vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) and other
bat species are killed in large numbers to reduce rabies infections
among humans and livestock. Veterinary quarantine and control programs
for wild animals have been successfully constrained or curtailed in some
areas by strong public opposition, however. For example, efforts
currently under way to reduce the incidence of Lyme disease among humans
by the large-scale culling of whitetail deer populations in the eastern
United States have been blocked in many localities as the result of
political lobbying and legal challenges by animal rights organizations
(e.g., Animal Protection Institute 1997). Conflict and contagion
Breakdowns in medical and veterinary support systems during wars and
civil conflicts have resulted in epidemic outbreaks of diseases within
and among human, livestock, and wildlife populations (Lawrence et al.
1980, Kobuch et al. 1990). Recent **[outbreaks of]{.underline}** several
lethal **[epizootic diseases]{.underline}** (monkeypox, Marburg fever,
plague) in Central Africa **[have been linked to]{.underline}**
increased human consumption of species of wild animals (e.g., squirrels
and rodents) as **[the result of wartime]{.underline}** food shortages,
coupled with the disappearance of preferred bushmeat species (primates,
duikers) caused by overharvesting for the bushmeat trade (Fenner 1993,
IRIN 1997, Dudley et al. 2002). The Iran--Iraq war and the Gulf war
precipitated rinderpest epizootics among livestock populations in that
region, which may have been caused or aggravated by war-related
displacements of pastoralists and their flocks (Roeder 1999). Disruption
of government veterinary services during the civil war in Southern
Rhodesia is believed to have contributed to epidemic outbreaks of
anthrax and rabies among wild and domesticated animals in that country,
now named Zimbabwe. Anthrax mortality among humans and livestock reached
epidemic proportions in 1979 and 1980 and continued to proliferate for
more than 4 years following the end of the civil war in 1980 (Lawrence
et al. 1980, Kobuch et al. 1990). Control and containment of the disease
may have been hindered by internal ethnic and political conflicts in the
Matabeleland region during the early postwar era (1980--1984). Anthrax
ultimately spread through six of Zimbabwe\'s eight provinces, with more
than 10,000 recorded human cases before effective control of the disease
was finally reestablished in 1987 (Pugh and Davies 1990). Although
anthrax is endemic to the Matabeleland region of Zimbabwe, where the
outbreak first appeared and proliferated, widely publicized speculation
has it that the 1979--1987 anthrax epidemic may have been linked to
covert operations of the apartheid South African Defense Force, the
Rhodesian Central Intelligence Organization, or rival guerrilla factions
(Carus 2001). However, there seems to be little evidence to support
allegations of the use of weaponized anthrax against human populations
in Zimbabwe, as the vast majority of documented cases involved secondary
cutaneous infections resulting from apparent contact with diseased
cattle (Kobuch et al. 1990, Pugh and Davies 1990). This interpretation
appears to be supported by the subsequent resurgence of human anthrax in
Zimbabwe in recent years (Mwenye et al. 1996), with nearly 1000
documented human cases and at least 11 deaths recorded in 2000 and 2001
(ISID 2001). Economic distress and the disruption of anthrax vaccination
programs and veterinary services as the result of internal political
turmoil appear to be important factors behind the current anthrax
outbreak in Zimbabwe, as was apparently the case during the 1979--1987
outbreak as well. Deteriorating economic conditions and food shortages
seem to be driving villagers to risk disease or death from infections
acquired through butchering diseased cattle for the consumption or sale
of meat and hides (ISID 2001). Technologies and threats **[The threat of
attacks with biological weapons has increased greatly]{.underline}**
since the ratification of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention in
1975. Although **[recent advances in biotechnology have]{.underline}**
augmented the potential economic value of the genetic diversity of
organisms by enabling the transfer of genes between even unrelated
species (Perrings et al. 1995), they have also **[increased the threat
of their elimination through the use of genetically modified disease
organisms as weapons of mass destruction]{.underline}**. **[The breakup
of the Soviet bioweapons program]{.underline}** and the dispersal of its
scientists and technicians may have **[heightened]{.underline}**, rather
than lowered, **[the global proliferation of bioweapons
technologies]{.underline}** (Bozheyeva et al. 1999). The basic
techniques for culturing many bioweapon organisms are relatively simple,
and microbrewery and pharmaceutical equipment, easily adaptable for
bioweapons production, is readily available through domestic and
international commercial markets (OTA 1993). **[The cost of
developing]{.underline}** small-scale but nonetheless **[sophisticated
bioweapons]{.underline}** facilities and arsenals **[is]{.underline}**
in the range of \$10,000 to \$100,000, **[an amount easily
affordable]{.underline}** for affluent and technologically sophisticated
domestic terrorist groups like the Aum Shinrikyo or well-funded
international organizations such as Al Qaeda, Hamas, and Hezbollah
(USCNS/21 1999). Nevertheless, specialized technicians and
state-of-the-art research facilities are not necessary for the
production and deployment of many highly dangerous bioweapons organisms
for clandestine, economically targeted assaults on agricultural crops or
livestock populations (OTA 1993). Bioweapon cultures, diseased animals,
or infectious materials could be easily introduced into international
cargo transportation networks for shipment to the United States or
elsewhere, with virtually no risk of identification or interception
(Flynn 2000). The spillover of weaponized livestock diseases into
susceptible wildlife populations could amplify and exacerbate the
effects of initial attacks and create situations in which disease
containment and control could become extremely difficult and total
eradication virtually impossible (Daszak et al. 2000). There appears to
be increasing interest on the part of international terrorist groups in
bioweapons technologies and applications. There is evidence that
bioweapon research facilities have been established in countries such as
Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Libya that are known to have (or have had)
cooperative or supportive relationships with international terrorist
organizations. Nonetheless, we predict that runaway disease epidemics
resulting from terrorist uses of bioweapons will most likely arise from
accidental or inadvertent releases of virulent, broad-spectrum disease
agents in developing countries, as the result of improper handling or
inadequate containment within production and storage facilities
incidental and accidental deployments of disease agents in transit
inadvertent releases resulting from the disruption or destruction of
bioweapon production or storage facilities (e.g., a cruise missile
attack on an alleged chemical weapons production facility) Economic
impacts The recent outbreak of FMD in Britain demonstrates that **[even
countries with a well-organized and technologically sophisticated
veterinary services infrastructure are susceptible to
introductions]{.underline}** (whether deliberate or inadvertent) **[of
highly infectious pathogenic agents]{.underline}** **[into their
livestock populations]{.underline}**. **[The economic consequences of a
disease epidemic affecting livestock are severe for any
country]{.underline}**, whether industrialized or developing. For
example, the total **[costs of containment and eradication
of]{.underline}** the 1997 **[FMD outbreak]{.underline}** in Taiwan
**[approached \$15 billion.]{.underline}** **[Direct and indirect losses
to the British economy associated with the]{.underline}** 2001 **[FMD
outbreak are expected to be]{.underline}** \$12 billion to **[\$14
billion]{.underline}** (OIE 2001). Losses in meat and livestock export
revenue amounted to approximately \$14 million per week. Estimated
losses to the tourism industry because of restrictions on travel in
affected areas were estimated at around \$350 million per week in March
2001, or 25 times (2,500%) higher than concurrent direct losses in the
agricultural export sector. Total economic losses to the national
tourism industry during the peak of the FMD epidemic in March 2001 were
estimated at more than \$4 billion and are still rising (Dudley and
Woodford 2002). The potential for catastrophic social and economic
consequences from bioweapon disease epidemics is proportionally higher
in developing countries, where doctors, veterinarians, antibiotics, and
medical or veterinarian treatment and quarantine facilities are in short
supply. Technical and logistical capabilities for countering the impacts
of disease threats from bioweapons and emerging infectious diseases may
be handicapped by the ongoing proliferation of drug-resistant disease
strains of important diseases such as tuberculosis (Mycobacterium
tuberculosis) and malaria (Plasmodium spp.). Improper use and
inappropriate uses of antibiotics to suppress diseases and infections in
both humans and animals are contributing to the emergence of
drug-resistant strains of many important human and animal pathogens. The
current widespread use of antibiotics in livestock feeds, now banned
only in the European Union, may have serious epidemiological
consequences (McDonald et al. 2001). Nearly half of all antibiotics used
in the United States are dispensed in animal feeds, despite growing
scientific concern over that practice (Gorbach 2001). Incomplete
treatment regimens, inappropriate clinical applications, adulterated
medicines, and both inadvertent and deliberate subtherapeutic uses of
antibiotics are resulting in the evolution---through human
selection---of highly resistant and highly virulent strains of disease
organisms. In effect, the current situation represents an ongoing,
essentially uncontrolled field experiment in the cultivation and
proliferation of antibiotic-resistant microbe populations. This problem
may well be aggravated by fear of exposure to bioterrorist
attacks---witness the panic-inspired purchases and consumption of
antibiotics by American citizens after the anthrax attacks during
September and November 2001. Subsequent events proved that such concerns
were not entirely unwarranted---5 of the 21 people known to have
contracted anthrax as the result of exposure to contaminated mail
subsequently died as the result of undiagnosed or tardily diagnosed
pulmonary anthrax infections.

The Alliance faces a range of significant opportunities in emerging and

[require both a **dynamic adoption** of new technologies and a **focus**

[CBT is the ability for technology to **enhance** and **improve**

The field is in its infancy, but its implications are vast. For

Conversely, [our inner minds are no longer off limits
either]{.underline}: while emerging brain-computer interfaces allow us

[recovering]{.underline} or (in cases of traumatic stress) [suppressing
memories]{.underline}; [and restoring **decision-making** and
**executive functions**.]{.underline}

[**Raise** includes the **augmentation** and **enhancement** of
cognitive and physiological function past an **individual's natural
baseline,**]{.underline} thereby [effecting dramatic changes in
operational effectiveness, preparedness, and training]{.underline}.
[Applications include sensory enhancement]{.underline} (such as seeing
farther or hearing more acutely); [faster information processing;
quicker and more effective decision-making]{.underline}; [more efficient
learning and language acquisition]{.underline}; [and greater physical
exertion and endurance]{.underline}. What is true for individual
capabilities could similarly be true for groups. [CBT could be used to
raise unit capabilities through distributed intelligence]{.underline} --
that is[, all members of the unit see and know what each individual
member sees and knows]{.underline}, thus [reducing the "fog of war" and
improving **rapid decision-making**]{.underline}, as well as enabling
more rapid acquisition and assimilation of new fighting techniques and
technologies.

[**Replace** includes the **enhancement** (and possibly
**substitution**) of mental and physical functions past the **bounds**
of **human potential**. Sensory connections could be replaced with
computer interfaces, making human capabilities independent of their five
natural senses. Verbal communication could be replaced by computer-aided
telepathy or data downloads. Physical action could be **replaced** by
remote robots or "**loyal wingman**" drones directed by the mind of the
operator. This is perhaps the **most futuristic form** of enhancement,
with most research and development nascent in nature]{.underline}. It is
important to note that this form of enhancement does not completely
remove human interaction, or else it would be simply another form of
automation[; it is really about the **merger** of **human biology** and
**mechanical actuation**.]{.underline}

These distinctions may prove helpful in setting priorities for further
research, investment in technological development, and adoption for
operational use. And they could also help in setting principles of
responsible use, [considering the three categories' differing levels of
technical risk and ethical uncertainty]{.underline}.

The current state and future potential of CBT

[Cognitive Biotechnologies are at present focused on three main areas of
research: biophysical, biochemical and behavioural]{.underline}. The
future direction of these technologies is difficult to predict,
particularly as many are still emerging. But [they have the potential to
significantly disrupt **existing assumptions** about the **evolution**
of civil society, the economy, and military affairs]{.underline}. It is
therefore in the interest of [the Alliance]{.underline} to [closely
monitor the rise of those technologies and applications that are most
likely to affect or disrupt current defence constructs and
doctrine.]{.underline} Moreover, [it will be important to direct
**early-stage investment** into those areas that are particularly
promising for the Alliance, or to those which will most likely impact
its **competitiveness**.]{.underline}

Biophysical technologies

[Advances in the **biophysical** area centre on **brain computer
interfaces**]{.underline} (BCI), [which can be directly inserted into
the human body or via transcranial direct-current
stimulation]{.underline} (tDCS). [tDCS is a form of neuromodulation that
uses constant, direct currents delivered via electrodes on the
head]{.underline}, and can be worn or removed at will. While BCI was
originally developed to provide assistive technologies (such as
prosthetic arms and mentally controlled wheelchairs), [recent
developments in bi-directionality have allowed for enhanced sensing, for
example, **bionic eyes** or other **enhancements** to **situational
awareness**]{.underline}. [Further applications]{.underline} of these
technologies [could lead to mental control of aircraft or ground vehicle
systems]{.underline}; [mind-guided drones or missiles]{.underline};
[or]{.underline} the [mechanisation of soldiers via exoskeletons and
advanced sensors.]{.underline}

[Exoskeletons]{.underline} can improve a soldier's physical
capabilities, [allow]{.underline}ing [them to run faster, lift heavier
objects and relieve strain on the body.]{.underline}

At the same time, [tDCS applications have been shown to regulate the
human brain itself, affecting the brain's executive functions, learning
mechanisms, memory, language processing, sensory perception, and motor
functions]{.underline}. Current work with tDCS focuses on recovery from
PTSD and treatment of mental ailments like obsessive compulsive
disorder. But [the technology also provides for the possibility of
**raising** soldiers' **cognitive** and **physical** capabilities: to
analyse scenarios more easily and quickly; to retain and retrieve
memories with greater acuity; to modulate perceptions of pain; to
improve psychological self-protection; and to embed **muscle memory**
and motor skills more quickly]{.underline}. Another [controversial
aspect]{.underline} of tDCS [is]{.underline} the [potential to **look
inside** the **mind** of the user]{.underline}, to display and play back
past memories on an external monitor, or even to insert synthetic
memories and images into the mind.

Biochemical technologies

[Biochemical research has focused on enhancements to human physiology
and cognitive function via drugs, genetic modification and biological
derivatives]{.underline}. [Combinations]{.underline} of nootropic
compounds, both natural and synthetic, [have been shown to rebalance and
optimise **neurochemistry** for improved brain and nervous system
function and efficiency]{.underline}. [These have the potential for
raising **alertness** and **attention**; speeding up reaction times;
enhancing endurance and mental resilience; reducing **apprehension** and
**fear**; and improving group dynamics and coordination]{.underline}.
Recovery aspects include the treatment of depression, PTSD, memory loss,
and dementia.

Behavioural technologies

[Behavioural research]{.underline} is [focused on]{.underline} the
[modification and improvement of cognitive and motor function through
learning algorithms, virtual reality and biofeedback
methods]{.underline}. Virtual reality environments have already
demonstrated their use in the training of pilots, tank crews and
infantry. [Mental acuity can be enhanced by training and gamification
algorithms]{.underline}. [Behaviour and personal habits can be altered
by reinforcement learning methods. Applications focus on]{.underline}
both [improvement and recovery, with]{.underline} recent [advances
in]{.underline} the treatment of [PTSD and behavioural
disorders]{.underline}.

A demonstration of a combat simulator, a form of PTSD treatment, is
conducted at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda,
Maryland, United States.

The integration of real-time cognitive and physiological user data
(e.g., measures of attention, heart rate, etc.) opens a new vista for
raising physical and cognitive performance. [Motivational stimuli can be
delivered back to the user based on his current physiological and mental
state via **machine learning-derived** algorithms]{.underline}. The
future of a personal coach on an intelligent FitBit that motivates and
guides you to peak performance may not be too far away. [The aggregation
of anonymised data from individual performance outcomes into **big
datasets** could further **improve** these algorithms]{.underline}. The
result may be a FitBit that knows you better than you know yourself.

Ethical issues and responsible use

[There are several ethical considerations for CBT that may transcend
even AI in their complexity. First is the issue of **personal
agency**]{.underline}. If CBT is able to motivate, enable, and even
control human decision making and action, [where does individual
responsibility end? Are soldiers **responsible** for their actions when
under the **influence** of advanced CBT, and under what
**conditions**?]{.underline}

Relatedly, [how does the Alliance ensure that there is sufficient
consent for the use of CBT for individuals tasked to use the technology?
These technologies can be invasive, both physiologically and
mentally]{.underline}, and have the potential to cause harm,
particularly as [we do not fully understand their unintended cognitive
and biological consequences]{.underline}.

In addition, [**significant privacy concerns** will be raised
once]{.underline} these [technologies]{.underline} can [enter our minds
and see our most private thoughts and memories. What are the **limits**
of such searches?]{.underline} And [what are the **protections** for
**physiological** and **cognitive data**, and who may **store** and
**control** their **dissemination** or cause their
deletion?]{.underline} More generally, [what protections will we have
against the potential of **mind control**, **cognitive erasure**, and
**reprogramming**?]{.underline}

The [Alliance's success]{.underline} with CBT will [depend upon
well-designed principles and practices relating to these ethical
considerations, since the adoption and integration of these technologies
will be based on the consent and acceptance of Allied governments and
their societies at large.]{.underline} As in the case of AI, [the
Alliance and member governments will need to develop principles of
**responsible use**, addressing such issues as privacy, consent,
lawfulness, responsibility and governability.]{.underline}

#### However, squo biotechnical interoperability concerns will [undermine]{.underline} the alliance now -- only the plan's increased standardization, funding, and sharing solve gaps in the allied arsenal -- allows to overmatch in land warfare to sustain allied defense capabilities

**[Despite such complicated relation between ICT and the military, NATO
armies have to exploit the possible advantages of
technologies]{.underline}** -- particularly but not only new and
disruptive ones. **[The pace of innovation in artificial intelligence,
robotics, nano- and bio-technologies, unmanned systems, materials,
quantum computing as well as post-quantum, is going to change the
contemporary battlefield, in manners that are still hard to grasp and
fully understand]{.underline}**. On top of that, **[a leap forward is
needed for soldiers' individual weapons when it comes to range and
lethality: lighter and more effective and lethal weapons and ammunition
currently are among the main solutions designed to regain overmatch over
adversary]{.underline}** (**[Russian and Chinese]{.underline}**)
**[small arms]{.underline}**214 **[and soldiers]{.underline}**. **[The
US Army is running a major initiative for the development of a new
family of infantry weapons through the Next Generation Squad Weapons
programme]{.underline}**.215 As mentioned before, [the concrete risk is
to suffer tragic shocks on the battlefield when it is too late to
discover that the balance in terms of mobility, protection and lethality
is not satisfactory]{.underline}. **[The superiority enjoyed by Allies
has been eroded on a number of fields by near-peer competitors such as
Russia and China, and this applies to the land warfare
too]{.underline}**.216 **[This is indeed the real requirement driving
next generation soldier systems efforts in the NATO camp]{.underline}**:
**[to re-gain or actually establish overmatch capability against the
most advanced and best equipped soldiers]{.underline}**.

The related [investments on novel individual weapons, body armours made
of new materials, helmets and googles fit for augmented reality,
cognitive radios, enhanced multi-spectral sensors]{.underline} enabled
by modular integration, [data fusion and human-machine interface,
batteries and/or portable wearable fuel cells]{.underline} (hydrogen or
methanol feed),217 [are all steps of a path to be undertaken not only by
the US but also by European countries]{.underline}. **[The US Army
explicitly aims to regain the close combat tactical
overmatch]{.underline}**, i.e. the ability of a squad sized unit (around
10 soldiers) to impose its will on similar sized opponent under all
conditions and operational environments.218 **[Similar requirements are
shared by NATO and Western armies alike]{.underline}**.

[Europeans are compounded by their security interests to deter and
defend to the East, to militarily intervene in the South and South East
of Europe where the operational theatres become less and less permissive
because of aggressive regional and extra-regional powers]{.underline}219
[and to stand united with the US and NATO on a global geopolitical
competition vis-à-vis China]{.underline}. **[Such an international
security environment has important, direct implications for the European
armies]{.underline}**. For instance, the British Army is particularly
worried of Russian electronic warfare (EW),220 while French Army can
still fight in asymmetric conflicts like in the Sahel, but must have a
battle-hardened Army ready for joint operations even in the harshest
conflicts and facing the toughest clashes, up to a major confrontation,
and be capable of winning.221 **[For instance the rapid deployment of
Russian Army forces of about 90-100,000 soldiers with heavy armour and
artillery at the Ukrainian border deeply worried French Army circles,
both in terms of quality and quantity]{.underline}**. In Italy, the Army
is committed to implementing NATO's strategic perspectives on the
modernisation of military forces, which should be credible, agile,
aware, networked and resilient.222

**[Moreover, the demographic trends in the West, and particularly
Europe, point towards an ageing and either stable or declining
population, whereby the pool for Army's recruitment of high-quality
human resources]{.underline}** -- **[in both physical and cognitive
terms]{.underline}** -- **[will be increasingly
limited]{.underline}**223 despite the enrolment of female soldiers.
Other sociological trends further challenge the Army's ability to
recruit and retain skilled forces. This in turn will require investments
on unmanned systems: **[the individual soldier will not soon be replaced
by robots completely, but almost certainly these will work together more
closely over time]{.underline}**224 **[starting ISTAR but also loads
carrying and logistic support]{.underline}**225 -- for **[instance in
the US and Germany there are plans for a future introduction of
exoskeletons]{.underline}**. **[Working together necessitates secure C3
architecture bearing in mind that all future systems will have to take
in higher consideration the effectiveness of counter systems to be
fielded by nearpeer adversaries]{.underline}**.

10.5 [The way ahead: A renewed System of Systems approach]{.underline}

European armies, including the Italian one, can better walk through the
challenging path towards next generation soldier's equipment by adopting
a renewed System of Systems approach. **[The SoS concept is not new, but
it needs to be renovated]{.underline}**. Its original formulation in the
military domain was rather top-down, striving for a seamless integration
of devices and capabilities to achieve better performances through a
holistic approach. [Because of the aforementioned Army's difficulties
and difficult relation between ICT and the military, the SoS approach
experienced a hard reality check over the 2010s, alongside with
net-centric and network enabled capabilities concepts]{.underline}.
**[The SoS principle is still valid, even more thanks to progresses on
sensors, robotics, computing, big data and AI, and it is being pursued
both by the Anglo-Saxon allies and by France's "collaborative
combat"]{.underline}**.226 **[Yet a pragmatic adjustment is necessary to
renew this approach and make it fir for current and future land
warfare]{.underline}**.

From an Italian perspective **[the dismounted soldier is per se the
first SoS since]{.underline}** he/ she **[operationally integrates all
the wearable devices including helmet, weapon, radio, goggles, nano or
micro UAV, etc.]{.underline}**227 As such, **[the soldier should be
entrusted with an appropriate degree of autonomy and sustainability,
compatible with]{.underline}** his/ her **[war-fighting
tasks]{.underline}**. **[That means tailoring the amount of information
to be received according to human being's cognitive capacity, as well as
the loads to]{.underline}** his/ her **[physical might]{.underline}**.
In other words, it is always necessary to make the dismounted soldier
equipment "a misura d'uomo":228 similarly to the Italian approach
featuring the soldier as centre of gravity,229 or to what the French
doctrine currently defines "à hauteur d'homme".230 [Bottom line is that
technology has to reduce the workload and risks for soldiers and
increase its combat effectiveness, while the humanmachine interface has
to be improved, designed and developed accordingly to support
decision-making with a human-in-the-loop]{.underline}.

**[Against this backdrop, the squad has to be considered the second,
crucial SoS]{.underline}**. [Such formation level seems to be more
appropriate for a division of labour and therefore an allocation of
technologies and information among commander, gunner, communication
officer, etc]{.underline}. This has important implications for instance
when it comes to unmanned air or ground vehicles. Most of the UxS will
be employed at a higher functional level such as platoon and above, but
several ones are becoming smaller and smaller, therefore suitable in
theory for squad and even single soldier employment.231 [The fact they
can be used by the dismounted soldier does not mean they should be used
at this level: a pragmatic SoS approach should rather look at the most
appropriate formation's levels, such as squad and platoon, for this and
other technologies]{.underline}. **[Notably, the US Army's approach to
modernisation at the infantry soldier level is shaped by a continued
commitment to a common squad size and design across its considerable
variety of formations, vehicles, and mission profiles]{.underline}**.232

[The same SoS approach to soldier and squad should apply, mutatis
mutandis, to the platoon and then to the higher echelons to be
considered as further system of systems, raising the level at which the
squad is required to integrate into the larger formations]{.underline}.
For instance, the platoon is particularly important from the Italian
Army's perspective. In this context, the Army vehicles support should
evolve to ensure better support to soldiers in terms of C3, energy,
firepower and shelter. In other words, [a renewed SoS approach should be
implemented more bottom up than top down, and the intrinsic horizontal
character of the net should be balanced by the necessary vertical
hierarchy which makes the military effective and resilient in a
conflict. The ICT advancements leads the military towards a compression
of both levels and timing of decision-making, but the related adaptation
should be managed by avoiding micromanagement and at the same time
safeguarding the unity of command. To restate the obvious, proper
education and training of military officials will be crucial to make the
best of current and future technologies in military
operations]{.underline}.

10.6 Near-peer adversaries and Multi Domain Operations

[Against this backdrop, a further challenge comes by the ongoing shift
from asymmetric to near-peer conflict scenarios. Indeed, opponents like
Russia and China are able to influence and/or disrupt Western C3
infrastructures and/or infostructures through a combination of cyber, EW
and kinetic attacks]{.underline}. Therefore, units at various levels --
from dismounted soldiers up to brigades -- have to be able to operate
even with a degraded network of communications, sensors and effectors.
For example, [the US Army is looking at a navigation system
incorporating simultaneous localisation and mapping technology, and
therefore capable of operating in a GPS-denied environment]{.underline}.
To a certain extent, [the near-peer threat in turn does question the
very same benefits of the SoS approach in a scenario where the various
systems, or subsystems, cannot be connected anymore in a secure
way]{.underline}.

Here comes the long shadow of cyber warfare. Given the nature of the
threat and the classification of relevant information, the cyber threat
to NATO military operations is extremely hard to assess. The emphasis
put over the last decade by the Atlantic Alliance and individual allies
on cyber defence hits towards a very high risk of intrusion into allied
networks. This in turn calls for a leap forward in the reflection on
offensive cyber operations by NATO members, or at least advanced
defence, in order to accompany the development of ICT capabilities for
Western armies which are secure by design. Encryption technology will be
key in this regard. The more the dismounted soldier relies on wireless
connection to weapon, augmented reality goggles, networks of sensors,
robotics and alike, the more the stove-piping of land warfare from cyber
warfare is a recipe for disaster. Once again, this is particularly
challenging for European countries like Italy which do not master the
fundamentals of the cyber domain as the US or -- increasingly -- China
do.

[The concept of Multi Domain Operations could help NATO militaries to
factor in the new operational domains, cyber and space, in the joint
planning and conduct of military operations, as well as in the defence
planning, capability development and defence industrial
policy]{.underline}. **[Recently conceived in the US, is it founding its
way in both NATO and national level debates]{.underline}**.233 From the
Italian Army it is also understood as a way for commanders to generate
effects across other domains to gain an operational advantage, for
instance against anti-access/area denial (A2/ AD) capabilities of a
near-peer competitor.234

However, an old saying reminds that "Not all that is gold does glitter":
after the disillusions brought by the implementation of concepts like
revolution in military affairs and network enabled capabilities, MDO
should be taken cum grano salis at least with regards to certain extreme
aspects. For example, despite Israel seems to move towards this
direction with Tsayad and Fire Weaver,235 the idea that an operation
command can autonomously and immediately call firepower from sea and air
domains, as well as cyber-attacks and satellite jamming, without going
for a politico-military process at strategic level, rises pros and cons,
as well as a number of unintended and dangerous consequences. Military
history shows that Napoleon won a number of land battles also thanks to
the integration of infantry, artillery and cavalry under a single chain
of command -- the modern Army -- while granting a relatively autonomous
role of the armées commanders. And a greater reliance on the lower level
commanders capability to carry out their assigned operation without
relying on the flow of information, direction and support by higher
echelons is mandatory, re-discovering the German concept of
Auftragstaktik -- where the emphasis is on the mission's outcome rather
than orders.236 For European militaries still somehow struggling to
overcome the single services' resistance to an effective joint
approach,237 probably the best solution is a pragmatic, bottom up path
to make the best of available technological improvements, from the
dismounted soldier up to various echelons.

10.7 The NATO and EU dimensions: Opportunities for Italy

[A final, crucial point regards both NATO and EU roles]{.underline}.
**[Within the transatlantic Alliance, the dismounted soldier equipment
is likely to see an increased technological and operational divide
between the "haves" and "haves not" of next generation technology, as
for technologies like big data and AI whereby the US lead the
technological race and fragmented European allies lags
behind]{.underline}**,238 **[with negative implications in terms of both
military interoperability and political cohesion.]{.underline}** **[Here
NATO has an important role to play as standard-setting organisation is
ultimately aimed at enhancing the interoperability and operational
effectiveness of its members' military forces]{.underline}**.239 For
instance, **[NATO could have a key role in the definition of standards
for the calibres of dismounted soldier's weapons, a process that could
turn out to be particularly important regarding the future replacement
of the 5.56 cartridges used by several allies]{.underline}**. **[NATO
has also a role to play when it comes to data sharing, because this has
huge implications for both allied operations and the creation of
datasets to develop military applications of AI]{.underline}**. This is
particularly true for European countries, thus EU too should contribute
to this sharing of data from its missions and operations, as well as
work to change those regulations (i.e. on data treatment) which often
have a negative impact in this regard.

Within the European Union, efforts have been undertaken first within the
EDA, which listed Ground Combat Capabilities among the top priorities of
its Capability Development Plan, and then through the PADR project
GOSSRA. Through the former, an industrial consortium240 performed an
analysis of the trends deemed likely to characterise the future
dismounted soldier equipment -- especially in terms of operational and
technological capabilities -- resulting in a comprehensive document
providing an architecture for standardisation. The European Commission
has further invested in this field through the EDIDP calls and currently
with the EDF 2021 round of calls for the development of innovative
military personal protective equipment, BLOS military systems, and
applications for the enhancement of soldiers' force protection and
mobility.241 The soldier equipment issue will most likely be included in
the subsequent annual work programmes through the EDF.

[In the land sector market access barriers are relatively low in terms
of investments, also considering the need by all European armies to
provide individual equipment kit to thousands of dismounted soldiers and
the EDTIB fragmentation in this sector]{.underline}. **[This in turn
encourages the protection and promotion of national solutions, even if
this increase costs and complexity, and delivers sub-optimal results
which are not marketable abroad and thus not sustainable in the long
term]{.underline}**. [This situation should be overcome through intra-EU
cooperation: despite the considerable organisational challenges,
collaborative activities would lead to significant benefits for European
armies in terms of standardisation, operational commonality, risk
sharing on new technologies, economies of scale, common MROU and
logistics and, above all, technological leaps forward to face near-peer
competitors and remain interoperable with the US and within
NATO]{.underline}. Such a step forward in intraEU cooperation in turn
would increase the efficiency and competitiveness of the EDTIB's land
sector. **[Bottom line is that both military and industrial cooperation
in Europe in mandatory to pursue really advanced technologies in a
cost-effective manner, and deploy them incrementally by the start of the
next decade to achieve greater combat effectiveness]{.underline}**.

#### **Failure to achieve overmatch guarantees nuclear war -- Russia and China will employ biotechnically engineered super soldiers to overcome Western defenses**

Nuclear War?: Bringing Geopolitics Back In.\" Strategic Studies

[Biotechnology could be exploited to produce \"super soldiers.\" China
has genetically engineered beagles with three times the muscle mass of a
typical canine, a technology that could possibly be applied to humans.
(49) Exoskeletons could provide soldiers with superhuman strength, and
brain implants promise superior cognitive performance. China employed
exo-skeletons in combat in its 2020 border conflict with India.
(50)]{.underline} It is not yet clear how these new technologies, when
combined with novel operational concepts, will affect the future of
warfare, but it is likely they will. A future state may, for example, be
able to use additive manufacturing to produce masses of inexpensive
drones directed by new AI algorithms to swarm and overwhelm adversaries.
(51) The attack might be preceded by cyber and counterspace attacks that
blind an adversary and disrupt its command and control. Following a
successful advance, the country could then employ directed-energy
weapons, autonomous mines, and other advanced defenses to lock in
territorial gains and thwart enemy attempts to roll back its aggression.
It is possible that the first state to hone these technologies and
devise effective operational concepts will have a military edge over its
opponents. Novel Applications How will states use such a newfound
advantage? Technology rarely fundamentally changes the nature or
objectives of states. More often, states use technology to advance
preexisting geopolitical aims. Moreover, enhanced power can result in
greater ambition. [Given the geopolitical landscape described, it is
likely the United States and its Allies and partners at the core of the
international system will behave differently with new military
technologies than will revisionist powers, such as Russia and
China.]{.underline} The spread of new technology to the United States
and its Allies and partners would likely serve, on balance, to reinforce
the existing sources of stability in the prevailing international
system. At the end of the Cold War, the United States and its Allies and
partners achieved a technological-military advantage over its great
power rivals, with the US using its unipolar position to deepen and
expand a rules- based system. They also employed their military
dominance to counter perceived threats from rogue states and terrorist
networks. The United States, its Allies, and partners did not, however,
engage in military aggression against great power, nuclear- armed rivals
or their allies. In the future, these status quo powers are apt to use
military advantages to reinforce their position in the international
system and to deter attacks against Allies and partners in Europe and
the Indo- Pacific. These states might also employ military power to deal
with threats posed by terrorist networks or by regional revisionist
powers such as Iran and North Korea. But it is extremely difficult to
imagine scenarios in which Washington or its Allies or partners would
use newfound military advantages provided by emerging technology to
conduct an armed attack against Russia or China. [Similarly, Moscow and
Beijing would likely use any newfound military strength to advance their
preexisting geopolitical aims. Given their very different positions in
the international system, however, these states are likely to employ new
military technologies in ways that are destabilizing. These states have
made clear their dissatisfaction with the existing international system
and their desire to revise it. Both countries have ongoing border
disputes with multiple neighboring countries. If Moscow developed new
military technologies and operational concepts that shifted the balance
of power in its favor, it would likely use this advantage to pursue
revisionist aims. If Moscow acquired a newfound ability to more easily
invade and occupy territory in Eastern Europe, for example (or if Putin
believed Russia had such a capability), it is more likely Russia would
be tempted to engage in aggression. Likewise, if China acquired an
enhanced ability through new technology to invade and occupy Taiwan or
contested islands in the East or South China Seas, Beijing\'s leaders
might also find this opportunity tempting. If new technology enhances
either power\'s anti- access, area- denial network, then its leaders may
be more confident in their ability to achieve a fait accompli attack
against a neighbor and then block a US- led liberation. These are
precisely the types of shifts in the balance of power that can lead to
war. As mentioned previously, the predominant scholarly theory on the
causes of war\--the bargaining model\--maintains that imperfect
information on the balance of power and the balance of resolve and
credible commitment problems result in international conflict. (52) New
technology can exacerbate these causal mechanisms by increasing
uncertainty about, or causing rapid shifts in, the balance of power.
Indeed as noted above, new military technology and the development of
new operational concepts have shifted the balance of power and resulted
in military conflict throughout history]{.underline}. Some may argue
emerging military technology is more likely to result in a new tech arms
race than in conflict. This is possible. But Moscow and Beijing may come
to believe (correctly or not) that new technology provides them a usable
military advantage over the United States and its Allies and partners.
In so doing, they may underestimate Washington. [If Moscow or Beijing
attacked a vulnerable US Ally or partner in their near abroad,
therefore, there would be a risk of major war with the potential for
nuclear escalation. The United States has formal treaty commitments with
several frontline states as well as an ambiguous defense obligation to
Taiwan. If Russia or China were to attack these states, it is likely, or
at least possible, that the United States would come to the defense of
the victims. While many question the wisdom or credibility of America\'s
global commitments, it would be difficult for the United States to
simply back down. Abandoning a treaty ally could cause fears that
America\'s global commitments would unravel. Any US president,
therefore, would feel great pressure to come to an Ally\'s defense and
expel Russian or Chinese forces. Once the United States and Russia or
China are at war, there would be a risk of nuclear escalation. As noted
previously, experts assess the greatest risk of nuclear war today does
not come from a bolt- out- of- the- blue strike but from nuclear
escalation in a regional, conventional conflict. (53) Russian leaders
may believe it is in their interest to use nuclear weapons early in a
conflict with the United States and NATO. (54) Russia possesses a large
and diverse arsenal, including thousands of nonstrategic nuclear
weapons, to support this nuclear strategy. In the 2018 Nuclear Posture
Review, Washington indicates it could retaliate against any Russian
nuclear \"de- escalation\" strikes with limited nuclear strikes of its
own using low- yield nuclear weapons. (55) The purpose of US strategy is
to deter Russian strikes. If deterrence fails, however, there is a clear
pathway to nuclear war between the United States and Russia. As Henry
Kissinger pointed out decades ago, there is no guarantee that, once
begun, a limited nuclear war stays limited. (56)]{.underline} There are
similar risks of nuclear escalation in the event of a US- China
conflict. China has traditionally [possessed a relaxed nuclear posture
with a small \"lean and effective\" deterrent and a formal \"no first
use\" policy. But China is relying more on its strategic forces. It is
projected to double\--if not triple or quadruple\--the size of its
nuclear arsenal in the coming decade. (57) Chinese experts have
acknowledged there is a narrow range of contingencies in which China
might use nuclear weapons first. (58) As in the case of Russia, the US
Nuclear Posture Review recognizes the possibility of limited Chinese
nuclear attacks and also holds out the potential of a limited US
reprisal with low- yield nuclear weapons as a deterrent. (59) If the
nuclear threshold is breached in a conflict between the United States
and China, the risk of nuclear exchange is real. In short, if a coming
revolution in military affairs provides a real or perceived battlefield
advantage for Russia or China, such a development raises the likelihood
of armed aggression against US regional allies, major power war, and an
increased risk of nuclear escalation.]{.underline}

Human enhancement [Efforts to field augmented troops represent new
approaches to the use of biotech]{.underline}nology [in
warfare]{.underline}, a qualitative [shift]{.underline} away from
traditional but uncertain bacteriological weapons [to entirely new
strategies for assuring battlefield dominance]{.underline}. As
proponents of this [biotech approach envision it, "futuristic,
'superhuman' capabilities of individual soldiers could enable small
units to operate for extended periods of time, carry the fight to remote
locales, and endure harsh extremes of climate"]{.underline} (Committee
2001, p. 7). Moreno (2006, p. 114) argues that **["The first state (or
nonstate) actor to build a better soldier will have taken an enormous
leap in the arms race."]{.underline}** Although seemingly fantastic,
billions of dollars have already been spent on several programs directed
toward fielding various types of "Augments." As with biotechnologies to
increase survivability, introducing mechanically or biologically
augmented living soldiers offers multiple benefits for states with the
capacity to do so. It also raises a host of political and ethical
questions without clear answers. Certainly, there would be tactical
advantages for militaries whose personnel are able to operate more
effectively than their adversaries under difficult conditions. And the
boon of losing fewer servicemen to injury, and being able to return
those who are injured to the front lines more quickly, is evident. But
there are also broader potential national and international political
impacts. Democratic governments, which endeavor to avoid costly or risky
wars, (Gartner and Segura 1998, Reiter and Stamm 2002) might be tempted
to exert their power as their Defence Studies 325 conventional force
advantages grow, and as the costs of providing for disabled veterans
diminish. Duncan (2012) writes about the ethics of augmentation when
everyone else is doing it. Parents might balk initially at the idea of
using technology to increase their children's cognitive performances,
but not if it means that they fall behind their augmented classmates.
Citizens might hesitate to vote for presidential candidates with neural
implants to enhance their reflexes and decision-making capabilities
during a crisis. But at some point, the question becomes "Would you vote
for a commander in chief who wasn't equipped with such a device?" This
hypothetical involving heads of state is about as far as most of the
ethicist approaches make toward questions of international security. But
it raises the question, and particularly [if rival hegemons are
dispatching Augments with advanced bioweapons and biomedicines to the
battlefield, what country with the capability to do so could justify
sending its soldiers into harm's way without the best advantages
possible?]{.underline} The edited volume Human Enhancement presents
opposing arguments over biopolitics between enthusiastic
"transhumanists" and skeptical "bioconservatives" (Bostrom and Savulescu
in Savulescu and Bostrom 2009, p. 1). Yet, for all of the discussion
about practical issues and debates over social and ethical
considerations ranging over hundreds of pages, there is no consideration
that enhanced soldiers are at least as likely as enhanced athletes, and
national security is not cited among the social obligations that
transhumanists claim justify even heritable germline modifications.
Fukuyama (2004, pp. 42--43) noted that because "[The new procedures and
technologies emerging]{.underline} from research laboratories and
hospitals ... [can]{.underline} as [easily be used to 'enhance' the
species]{.underline} as to ease or ameliorate illness.... The [first
victim of transhumanism might be equality]{.underline}," an implication
even more troubling at the international level when considering what
this might do to the already **[yawning resource gap between the richest
and poorest countries.]{.underline}** George Annas contended that:
Ultimately it almost seems inevitable [that genetic engineering would
move homo sapiens into **two separable** species: the standard-issue
human beings would be seen by the new, genetically enhanced
**neo-humans** as **heathens** who can properly be **slaughtered** and
**subjugated**. It is this **genocidal potential** that makes
species-altering genetic engineering a potential **w**eapon of **m**ass
**d**estruction and the unaccountable genetic engineer a potential
**bioterror**ist**.**]{.underline} (Juengst, in Savulescu and Bostrom
2009, p. 48) [Major powers with both conventional and asymmetric
biotechnological edges over rivals may similarly be open to the use of
force to maintain their positions if they are secure in the knowledge
that they are well beyond the capabilities of opponents to match
them]{.underline}. **[The advent of nuclear weapons is credited with
reducing the number of interstate wars, with the effect of entrenching
the hegemony of the technologically advanced states that wield
them]{.underline}**. RMA advances gave the United States a lopsided
advantage in its early post-Cold War interventions (zero combat deaths
during nearly three months of NATO missions during the Kosovo War), and
its initial easy success in toppling Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq
led, temporarily, to rapprochement efforts by "rogue" regimes Iran and
Libya to avoid the same fate. **[While advanced equipment is responsible
for these successes, biotech now offers the opportunity to enhance the
performance of the combatants themselves]{.underline}**. 326 D. Malet
[\[DARPA\] is engaged in]{.underline} the [development of]{.underline}
designer [drugs that will increase cognitive functioning]{.underline},
including attention span and alertness after periods of sleep
deprivation. Another area for future research is "neural prostheses"
that will enable commanders to monitor the vital signs of soldiers in
the field or even to permit the control of UAVs directly by pilots in
remote locations. (Huang and Kosal 2008) "In 2002, DARPA launched the
Augmented Cognition (or AugCog) initiative, a project dedicated to
developing a headband that monitors brain activity." With sensory input
controlled remotely, subjects doubled their recall and improved working
memory by 500% (The Economist 2010). Research on reducing the amount of
sleep that soldiers and pilots require to function effectively has
become a global enterprise, with countries including France, Canada,
Singapore, and Taiwan establishing military research units in this area.
In the language of these projects, fatigue and even sleep are described
as operational weaknesses preventing humans from taking full advantage
of their equipment, weaknesses that intervention can ameliorate. Some
major powers have already begun the attempt: during the Iraq War, the
British Ministry of Defense had purchased 24,000 tablets of one of the
most promising drugs, modafinil, and the United States and France both
began to routinely supply it to pilots. The use of stimulants by
militaries is so widely entrenched, with amphetamines in regular
prescribed use for decades (Saletan 2013), that Bostrom and Savulescu
(in Savulescu and Bostrom 2009, p. 2) question whether the use of
modafinil is qualitatively different from "a good cup of tea." But the
premise of reducing or eliminating the need for sleep as a component of
troop health is a recent development. Additionally, DARPA has provided
congressional testimony about its Continuous Assistance Program that
would "make the individual warfighter stronger, more alert, more
endurant, and better able to heal ... prevent fatigue and enable
soldiers to stay awake, alert, and effective for up to seven days
straight without suffering any deleterious mental or physical effects
and without using any of the current generation of stimulants."
Potential approaches include the use of transcranial magnetic and
electrical stimulation to activate brain pathways and to enhance
learning (Moreno 2006, pp. 11, 118). Lab mice that have been altered as
embryos with extra copies of a memory-related gene "learn more quickly
and remember things longer than normal mice ... and the improvement was
passed on to offspring" (Sandel, in Savulescu and Bostrom 2009, p. 74).
In the meantime, the military relies on more conventional stimulants,
and the results might give pause to planners considering more radical
medical interventions. B-1 bomber pilots who operate 19-h flights
between the Persian Gulf and United States take Dexedrine, an
amphetamine known as speed or "go pills." One such pilot, who
subsequently went drinking with buddies before attacking them in a fit
of paranoid delusions in which he seemed to believe he was in the
television series 24, was acquitted by a court-martial after military
psychiatrists concluded that he suffered from a "substanceinduced
delirium" (Murphy 2012). American pilots who killed Canadian soldiers in
a 2003 friendly fire incident in Afghanistan had also been on Dexedrine
during 30-h missions (Moreno 2006, p. 115). Another [DARPA]{.underline}
neural [program]{.underline} with battlefield applications is **[Silent
Talk]{.underline}**, which would [develop the capability to communicate
without speaking by recognizing the neural signals for specific
words]{.underline}. Linked devices would permit troops in the field to
recognize the signals for the "intended speech" of at least 100 words
commonly used by troops in combat operations (Warwick 2009). Beyond the
advantages of silent Defence Studies 327 communication and preventing
hostile forces from intercepting messages, such [technology would
effectively produce electronic telepathy and have a tremendous
commercial sector potential for hands-free communication.]{.underline}
While Augments would be able to receive more situational information on
the battlefield through neural devices, processing it effectively is
another matter. Technologies developed through the AugCog and Enabling
Stress Resistance projects might alert commanders that individuals are
suffering mental or physical exhaustion. Another approach would be to
"develop quantitative and integrative neuroscience-based approaches for
measuring, tracking, and accelerating skill acquisition and learning
while producing a twofold increase in progression in an individual's
progress through stages of task learning." **[Reminiscent of the neural
training uploads for particular weapons systems and martial arts in the
science fiction Matrix films, results would be achieved through the
"development of neurally based techniques for maintenance of acquired
skills \[and on\] preferential brain network activation]{.underline}**"
(DARPA, "Accelerated Learning" 2010). Another program with the goal of
"enhancing combat performance" studies the influences of biological
clocks on soldier health (DARPA, "Biochronicity" 2013). Other
biotechnologies would provide physical enhancements to Augments. The
field of biomimetics seeks to mimic useful naturally occurring
characteristics in living organisms. For example, ants and spiders can
lift loads dozens of times their own weight, and horses can withstand
freezing temperatures without thick hair. "Understanding how horses and
other animals overcome drastic changes in their environment would be
extremely useful. As a measure of the importance of biomimesis, the Army
has declared biomimetics one of its Strategic Research Objectives
(primary focus areas for basic research)" (Committee 2001, pp.14--15).
Already, researchers have developed synthetic genes that repair damaged
muscles and improve healthy ones in mice (Sandel, in Savulescu and
Bostrom 2009, p. 73). Another project at least at the prototype stage
for humans utilizes an electrically charged under suit "focusing on the
soft tissues that connect and interface with the skeletal system." The
goal of Warrior Web is "augmenting the work of Soldiers' own muscles to
significantly boost endurance, carrying capacity, and warfighter
effectiveness" (DARPA, "Warrior Web" 2013, DARPA, "Warrior Web Prototype
Takes Its First Steps" 2013).

**[The purpose of military technology development is to increase soldier
effectiveness]{.underline}**; it started with stones and spears and
today includes a sophistication that exceeds the capacity of any single
person's ability to create or decipher. [An important point is that
humans employ the technology and are responsible for its use, even for
an autonomously operated weapon system]{.underline}. [A corollary of
this principle is that systems should be designed to work with the
human]{.underline} (i.e., "humanized technology"); [the human should not
have to be selected or modified to fit the technology]{.underline}. In
order to design human centric systems, engineers and other materiel
developers need predictive models from the biomedical research commu-
nity that help define human performance limits and tolerances.16
**[Materiel developed without proper consideration for the human
operator leads to systems that may actually impair human per- formance
and require expensive retrofit or redesign]{.underline}**.17 **[If done
properly, Soldier-centric systems]{.underline}** "**[support the
creation of more competitive and agile soldiers and military
formations]{.underline}**."18 Colonel Robert Carter, **[the US Army's
senior uniformed physiologist]{.underline}**, **[has highlighted the
decisive advantage of AI technologies in modern multi-domain operations,
noting that]{.underline}** "**[the willingness of soldiers to fight with
traditional weapon systems may not afford the Army the strategic
advantage]{.underline}**."18 As defined in Table 1, [human performance
enhancement can be divided into two primary categories]{.underline}: (1)
[aug- mentation of human capabilities with assistive technologies,
and]{.underline} (2) [modification of human biology to expand human
capabilitie]{.underline}s.

**[Augmented performance involves primarily external systems, including
wearable systems such as a powered exoskeleton]{.underline}**,19
**[inward- and outward-looking monitors and decision support
tools]{.underline}**,20 **[and functional fiber suits that moderate
temperature, water loss and chemical exposures]{.underline}** (e.g.,
"Stillsuit" concept from science fiction21). It [also includes training
systems using virtual reality along with real time physiological
monitoring to provide biofeedback to develop enhanced mental and
physiological self- regulation capabilities; the same technologies can
be used to adapt information to the physiological status of the
individual opera- tor]{.underline} (e.g., "augmented cognition").22
Teams may train and operate with shared systems drawing on wearable
sensors and effectors (e.g., "brain net", a mentalized internet).23
**[Major components of a Matrix-like science fiction concept have been
demonstrated for a capability to artificially sense and activate muscles
to bend the body to dodge bullets]{.underline}**.24,25

The military human performance research community plays a vital role in
helping to make machines and AI more human-centric, built on the basis
of an understanding of human biology.26,27 [If the human is the primary
weapon system and all technology is to sup- port the soldier, then
augmentation technologies should be built around human capabilities,
biological tolerances, and humanized to perform in a way that is
consistent with human neurobiology]{.underline}.26--28 In the midst of
this current robotics and information technology era, there is a greater
need than ever before for human per- formance research that will solve
problems to optimize human, human-AI, and human-robot teams.13
**[Advances in bioinformat- ics and the continuous expansion of
computing power support the development of ever more sophisticated,
integrated and general- izable models]{.underline}**. **[These efforts
lead to a comprehensive model of the soldier phenome that accurately
predicts health and performance outcomes for many possible
conditions]{.underline}**. **[For example, a model of cognitive
multitasking helps combat developers consider how many remote drones a
human operator can effectively manage]{.underline}**.29 A separate
metabolic model of the effects of prolonged exhaus- tive exercise on
brain and behaviour provides a mission planning tool.30 [As the models
expand and combine, the effect of physical work and other metabolic
stressors on a soldier's decision making capabilities can be predicted
and workload redistributed within man-machine teams to maintain
effectiveness]{.underline}. These predictive simulations might be
running in real time on a digital twin model of the individual soldier
that includes personalized information such as the individual's
characteristic physiology, behaviour, and neurophysiological
resilience.31 [Biophysical modelling has already been demonstrated to
directly enhance human performance. For example, AI-based decision
support provided from thermal models combined with wearable
physiological monitors provides real- time march pacing, optimized for
mission requirements]{.underline}.32 Early models of the integration of
physiology and cognitive outcomes are emerging from clinical medicine
such as metabolic derangements in diabetes and neurodegenerative
diseases33,34 and the social sci- ences have evolved modelling tools
designed around theoretical concepts of human behaviour such as Adaptive
Control of Thought -- Rational.35

[The second category of performance enhancement involves biotechnologies
that actually modify human biology to achieve extraordinary individual
performance]{.underline} (Table 1). **[These involve drugs and genetic
engineering such as myostatin inhibitors or alterations in genes that
code for myostatin to create mas- sively muscled individuals; drugs and
synthetic microbiota that alter mood and cognition and delay fatigue;
and surgical mod- ifications including sculpting the cornea to alter
visual acuity]{.underline}**. This strategy of trying to improve human
biology by making humans more machine-like, with around-the-clock
performance capacity, greater load carriage ability, or savant-like
memory and computing capacity has been strikingly unsuccessful in
previous bold initiatives like the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency-sponsored continuous assisted program (CAP) and metabolic
dominance program.41 **[Biological]{.underline}** ("skin-in") **[per-
formance enhancement requires additional levels of rigor beyond
certification of augmentation technologies]{.underline}** ("skin-out")
**[because of the unpredictable risks to both human health and
performance]{.underline}**. Bioethical considerations add another
essential layer, but even an unethical enemy would be foolish to rush
headlong into trying to improve biology. **[Armies have long
contemplated creation of bio- logically modified super soldiers, and
some key lessons have been learned]{.underline}**42,43 (Table 2). [New
medical technology opportunities such as genetic engineering and drugs
developed for muscle disease treatments should not immediately provoke
knee jerk responses to create larger humans just because we
can]{.underline}. Before heading down this road, [biomedical developers
must consider why trying to improve human biology might be useful,
necessary, or sound]{.underline}. **[Based on mili- tary technology
trends, the ideal soldier of the future is probably not a better "human
pack mule" but rather a physiologically optimized, smart, agile, and
stress resistant teammate]{.underline}** (Table 2).

[There are nevertheless potential advantages in biotechnolog- ical
enhancement of healthy humans]{.underline}; [some of the promising
approaches are actually focused on preventing decrements in performance
that otherwise occur in extreme conditions]{.underline}.44 For [example,
the drug acetazolamide has an approved use for theprevention of acute
mountain sickness, encountered when unac- climated soldiers ascend
rapidly to altitude to confront an opponent]{.underline}.45,46 [This
represents a significant performance enhancer in mountain
warfare]{.underline}. Another path to performance enhancement might have
come from defining the biological underpinnings of exceptional
performers. In this case, the physiology of Quechua and Sherpa high
altitude dwellers does not readily lend itself to a simple technological
manipulation to recreate the same toler- ance for high altitude
exposure.47 Rather than attempting to create genetic "human llamas", the
pragmatic choice for an Army is to sim- ply identify and recruit adapted
individuals and/or use the proven drug intervention.

**[Emerging technologies may greatly expand soldier capabilities but
there are risks associated with overdependence, including fail- ure to
sustain the technology-supported skills and capabilities]{.underline}**.
**[While personal electronics are enormously empowering tools, sol-
diers must also be trained for the sudden loss of these capabilities in
isolated or electronic warfare environments]{.underline}**. The
disadvantage would be further magnified in a fight against a
technology-poor opponent that has always trained to operate in power and
com- munications deprived environments (e.g., wayfinding skills).48
**[Real-time physiological status monitoring]{.underline}** (RT-PSM)
**[can provide intelligence on the performance of our own soldiers but
this can also fail, be blocked, or hacked. RT-PSM may be useful in
training individual and group performance, but in operational
environments such technology is simply a distraction unless it pro-
vides vital actionable information]{.underline}**.20 Physiologically
aware virtual agents may provide a trusted coach or advisor capability
including machine assessment of soldier mental status and team perfor-
mance, redistributing cognitive workload or modifying information
presentation within teams, but it remains to be discovered how this
synthetic social structure will affect human mental resilience and team
dynamics.49,50 [The trust component is critical to soldier cooperation
with their virtual teammates and another key research theme of its
own]{.underline}. [Load carriage and speed of movement may be enhanced
with assistive technologies such as exoskeleton pow- ered boots,
speeding a small unit over rough terrain; however, there may be risks of
disuse atrophy of musculoskeletal elements associated with overreliance
on an exoskeleton system]{.underline}. Also, syn- thetic interactions
with machines may reveal hitherto unknown aspects of social biology
essential to optimal functioning including that of isolated individuals
and teams.51 **[In the training environ- ment and in mission
preparation, new technologies are already being exploited for stressful
and realistic exposures in a safe vir- tual reality
environment]{.underline}**,52 **[but we need to understand the risks of
stressful exposures which can serve to sensitize some individuals to
future stress or "stress inoculate" others, and also ensure that
artificially trained skills translate correctly to real world applica-
tions]{.underline}**.

#### Only investments in biotechnology solves -- anything [less]{.underline} erodes deterrence

The Biotech Revolution in Military Affairs There have been [numerous
studies of the impacts]{.underline} of a wide array [of emergent
tech]{.underline}nologies [by hegemonic actors]{.underline} or aspirants
(For a preliminary list . However, [there has been little examination of
what the adoption of **biotech**]{.underline}nology [by the leading
military powers has meant]{.underline} or is likely to mean. The United
States Office of Technology Assessment defines biotechnology as "any
technique that uses a living organism, or parts of organisms, to make or
modify products, to improve plants or animals, or to develop
microorganisms for specific uses." Other definitions include material
patterned after living organisms but not necessarily using them as
components (biomimetics). The conventional wisdom on biotechnology has
held that [coming decades will see Western nations increasingly
vulnerable to ever-more sophisticated **bio**logical **weapons**
**attacks** by **non-state actors** and **rogue states**]{.underline}.
[As recombinant genetic technology proliferates, a **greater number** of
actors will possess genetic engineering capabilities that will enhance
the **lethality** and durability of their biological
weapons]{.underline}. Proponents of this perspective note that the
**[overwhelming tech]{.underline}**nological [**advantage** in
conventional forces enjoyed by the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates **[creates the incentive for competitors to develop
effective asymmetric responses]{.underline}**, and that the
affo[rdability, accessibility, and relatively easy preparation of
biological weapons make them a likely means]{.underline} of doing so. In
this view, **[the superior conventional capabilities of the US military
not only fail to deter the proliferation of biological weapons, but
encourage their development.]{.underline}** Western [states will
face]{.underline} an incr[easing number of biologically armed opponents,
and will remain on the defensive]{.underline}. The priority for military
biotech research is therefore the development of protective equipment
and vaccines, antibiotics and antivirals (Department of Defense 1998).
However, this scenario requires the presumption that military
applications of biotechnology will simply be a secular progression from
the bacteriological warfare that has existed throughout history. Even
when analysts have factored in the vast possibilities of genetic
engineering, it has usually only been to the extent that they can breed
deadlier pathogens, and that the growing availability of technology
means that it may be used by a broader spectrum of actors. [Conventional
wisdom]{.underline} therefore [predicts an **unstable future** for the
international system, a Hobbesian world in which the weakest have power
to kill the strongest.]{.underline} Rather than rogue states and
non-state terrorists, [it is the most **powerful** and resource-laden
actors in the international system that will enjoy the advantages of
"biological warfare"]{.underline} in the twenty-first century [as they
continuously integrate emergent biotech]{.underline}nologies [into their
**military** and national defense infrastructures and extend their
**dominance**]{.underline}. This process will closely resemble the
Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) that occurred during the last 30
years of the twentieth century as the United States adapted its forces
to exploit advances in new information technologies. The RMA, first
described by the Soviet military intelligence in the 1970s and then
witnessed by the world during the unexpectedly uneven 1991 Gulf War,
occurred because the United States employed its competitive advantage in
integrated computer systems. Rather than a single transformative device,
like the atomic bomb, the steady accretion of advanced technologies
augmenting existing equipment came to inform doctrine and strategies.
The term asymmetric warfare is meant to describe efforts by weaker
participants in military confrontations to frustrate the advantages of
the stronger power by guerilla tactics or other unconventional methods
not envisioned in force planning (Mack 1975). However, high technology
also offers asymmetric advantages to the best-equipped actors, and
American military planners sought to use the advances of the RMA to
field forces that no state competitor could match. Their goals included
"dominant maneuver" capability on the battlefield in bringing dispersed
resources to bear against targets, "precision engagement" capability
delivered by smart weapons, and "full dimension force protection"
against all anticipated threats (Rizwan 2000). The ultimate expression
of this vision would be a fighter comparable to a "Jedi knight" from the
Star Wars films: a super-empowered solider, dressed in a protective
stealth cloak and commanding an Defence Studies 321 Downloaded by
\[University of California, San Diego\] at 23:56 08 March 2016 armed
companion drone, able to perform solo missions and to transmit data back
to headquarters (Hundley and Gritton 1994). Coincidentally or not, this
is precisely how Darth Maul was depicted in 1999's The Phantom Menace.
Military planners likewise foresee similar advantages conferred by
developments across the various biotech fields. In coming decades,
[biotech]{.underline}nology [is forecast to bring advances]{.underline}
such as "rugged computers" made from biological components [that will
provide situational awareness]{.underline} to individual soldiers on the
battlefield, [camouflage]{.underline}d materials and [lightweight
armor]{.underline} incorporating the properties of living organisms,
[and ingested biological markers to distinguish friendlies]{.underline},
which would be of particular use **[in counterinsurgency]{.underline}**
(Purdue University 2001). From the perspective of those involved in
force planning, the anticipated future is not one of vulnerability but
unassailability

### Plan/Solvency

#### Thus, the plan -- The United States federal government should substantially increase its funding, information sharing, and technology transfers on neuroscience and technology with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the area of cognitive biotechnology.

#### The plan solves NATO's gaps in neuroS/T weaponization -- a [whole]{.underline}-[of]{.underline}-[alliance]{.underline} approach is key -- unilateral or partial approaches result in [massive]{.underline} capability gaps that undermine security

**[In sum, it is not a question of whether neuroS/T will be utilized in
military, intelligence, and political operations, but rather when, how,
to what extent, and perhaps most importantly, whether or not the US and
its allies will be prepared to address, meet, counter, or prevent these
risks and threats]{.underline}**. In this light (and based upon the
information presented in this report), **[it is and will be increasingly
important to address the complex issues generated by the brain sciences'
influence upon global biosecurity and the near-term future scope and
conduct of both non-kinetic and kinetic military and intelligence
operations]{.underline}** (DeFranco et al., 2019). **[Thus, if the US
and its international allies seek to retain a leading role in the global

#### The plan's multilateral approach ensures that key players of the alliances are involved, resources are adequately shared, and effective development of biotechnologies can take place [without]{.underline} losing the alliance's technological edge over adversaries

**NATO '21**, NATO Parliamentary Assembly, "In virtual visit to France,
NATO Parliamentarians discuss space security, biotech advances and NATO
S&T cooperation", NATO-PA, 7/4/21,
https://www.nato-pa.int/news/virtual-visit-france-nato-parliamentarians-discuss-space-security-biotech-advances-and-nato-st

[Possible security risks emanating from the rapid advance of
biotechnology were also on the agenda of the visit]{.underline}.
[Ambassador]{.underline} Yann [Hwang]{.underline}, [Permanent
Representative of France]{.underline} to the Conference on Disarmament
in Geneva, [noted that it is no surprise that biotechnology and the
possible menace of bioweapons is at the forefront of thinking for many
parliamentarians today]{.underline}. Much like in the domain of space,
he emphasised that, "**[We can see that norms allow us to accomplish a
great deal. The question, then, is to operationalise these frameworks,
which is not currently the case]{.underline}**." Ambassador Hwang thus
**[called for greater attention regarding the potentially positive role
played by the Biological Weapons Convention]{.underline}** (BWC) **[in
ensuring that biotechnologies are used for peaceful purposes
only]{.underline}**.

Elisande Nexon, Senior Research Fellow at the French Foundation for
Strategic Research (FRS), noted that [the international community has
witnessed how biotechnology can help address healthcare issues in the
context of COVID-19. Similar impacts, she argued, could be seen in areas
like agriculture, environmental industries, or the materials industry.
**Still, she said, the stakes are high, as there are a variety of risks
inherent in biotechnology, including laboratory leaks, environmental
spill over effects and ethical issues**]{.underline}.

**[Both experts cautioned against a blanket approach to the banning of
certain biotechnologies or the prevention of their development as a
whole]{.underline}**. **[An appropriate approach would instead be to
focus on legislation and multilateral
cooperation]{.underline}**\*\*,\*\* the Committee was informed. Ms
**[Nexon emphasised that]{.underline}** "**[we need to promote
international cooperation and information exchange]{.underline}**,"
adding that difficulties exist **[because]{.underline}**, "**[there are
significant differences between states]{.underline}** -- **[whether
national interests, regulations, views on \[human rights\], and
financial resources]{.underline}**." **[The promotion of information
exchanges, emphasis on improved transparency, and a general effort to
raise awareness with the public of potential risks inherent in
biotechnologies are all valid lines of action]{.underline}**, she
argued. To that end, **[NATO Allies should]{.underline}** "**[train,
regulate and encourage scientists to adhere to these approaches, and to
evaluate risks and threats regularly with academia and
scientists]{.underline}**. **[It is important that we are able to
recognise whether]{.underline}** \[**[an incident related to
biotechnology]{.underline}**\] **[was accidental or deliberate, and
whether we can attribute responsibility to a human actor]{.underline}**
\[...\]."

Finally, [the delegation also learned of the importance of cooperation
in the field of S&T, and in particular the role of the Collaboration
Support Office]{.underline} ([CSO]{.underline}) [in NATO\'s Science and
Technology Organisation]{.underline} ([STO]{.underline}). John-Mikal
STØRDAL, CSO Director, emphasised that "**[collaborative Science and
Technology within NATO has enabled the Alliance to produce the most
advanced and efficient defence systems the world has ever
seen]{.underline}**." **[He warned that there is a real possibility that
NATO could lose its technological edge but stressed that the work of the
Assembly's Science and Technology Committee has had a positive impact in
raising awareness of this possibility]{.underline}**, citing the 2018
NATO PA report, Maintaining the Edge and Enhancing Alliance Agility.
"[Today, emerging and disruptive technologies are firmly placed on the
agenda for NATO 2030, as was clear in the last Summit
Communique]{.underline}," he said.

The CSO Director also identified three areas where NATO Parliamentarians
can continue to make a difference: "We are at the threshold of
technological change beyond anything we've experienced before", he said,
"and **[NATO Allies need increased investment in S&T related
R&D]{.underline}** (**[not only military R&D]{.underline}**) **[at the
national level to stay ahead of this change]{.underline}**." **[He also
called upon NATO to engage with national representatives on the NATO
Science and Technology Board to discuss how to gain the most from the
Science and Technology Organisation and the Collaborative Programme of
Work]{.underline}**. Third, he stressed how important it is "to inspire
and motivate our young people to study STEM -- Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics -- disciplines. This is the only way to
have the highest quality scientists and engineers available to the NATO
STO Network and to improve the age and gender balance in these fields.

It's interesting to think back to the times when we thought the advanced
sci-fi technology that we saw in movies were too far-fetched to become
reality. However, now we live these scientific advancements. From
landing on the moon, to live video calling, and even Marty McFly's
self-lacing shoes, we are now left to question what further progress
will be made and what kind of impact they will have \[42\]. **[NATO and
the military serve many functions, and the benefits to be gained when it
comes to technological advancements are endless, especially in the field
of cognitive enhancements]{.underline}**. In order to understand what
the needs of further developments in this space are, we first sought to
investigate what products and research already exist -- both with and
without direct military applications. [We completed primary market
research by examining current research and technologies]{.underline},
then categorized each based on 1) the core faculties of cognition it
affects and 2) the method(s) of enhancement it utilizes. From here, we
curated our own categorization, the RAR framework, to analyze what
exists, realize what still needs to be developed, separate these into
use cases, and recommend what further actions should be taken to
actualize these developments. The following are some subjective
interesting fields of study we've identified in the RAR framework. [We
posit that NATO could partner with organizations such as the Johns
Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins Hospital, and
Harvard's Department of Psychology in order to lead and develop the
relevant technologies and fields of study]{.underline}. Regardless of
the direction, **[it is our belief that NATO can pilot these
advancements in a direction that will be beneficial to the alliance and
even to humankind itself]{.underline}**. Recover **[Brain-computer
interface methods have been rapidly developing technologies for
controlling machines and prosthetics with the brain\'s
help]{.underline}**. The current research into artificial sensory
feedback and brain-mapping have immense potential in terms of recovery
opportunities. **[NATO could leverage these technologies to explore
options on secondary assets such as retired veterans and injured
soldiers. The extraction of crucial information through memory
restoration will yield dividends in all sorts of combat and command
scenarios]{.underline}**. [BCI technologies also have the potential to
one day transfer one\'s muscle memory and skills to another human being
or computer]{.underline}. The collaboration of BCI and dTMS will
certainly have crucial applications for recovering cognitive abilities
in human beings. Augment [Education and learning as disciplines have
remained relatively stagnant through the centuries. However, as we begin
to learn more about the human mind and cognition, the discussion about
how we learn and understand information is being brought up and
questioned once again]{.underline}. **[There are already companies
developing memory and attention improvement technology and
methods]{.underline}**. The aim being to reach a state of "hyper
learning." [As the information space and big data continue their rapid
growth, the future is going to require ways to understand and synthesize
this information quickly and effectively in order to better educate and
advise students, leaders, and professionals]{.underline}. **[Education
of the future may be seen simply as information transfer]{.underline}**.
This field has already shown increased attention in recent years and
appears to be on a steep trajectory that will have significant
implications not only in the academic world, but the military and
civilian worlds as well. Replace [As we look beyond automating human
capabilities, we seek ways to replace our own cognitive abilities with
computers to maximize our efforts beyond human potential]{.underline}.
**[Brain-computer interface could be used towards development of
cyborgs, human activity using machines, providing injured soldiers with
computational mechanical prosthetics, or even using machines to control
human interactions. Ideas of replacing human speech such as \"conceptual
telepathy," where two people can communicate electronically by thinking
at each other instead of writing or speaking, have promising
applications in almost every aspect of human life]{.underline}** \[35\].
New Opportunities **[Subversion and subterfuge have been the operational
code of conduct for warfare and terrorism in the last few
decades]{.underline}**. [The recent machine learning breakthroughs could
produce much in terms of potential for this field.]{.underline} For
example, the idea of identifying, categorizing, and reading
micro-expressions in the face invisible to the naked eye will prove
invaluable in efforts to combat insidious threats. Imagine being able to
sit across from a terrorist and listing out words, only for a program to
tell you detailed conclusions about their operations from the
terrorist's uncontrollable micro-twitches. [Imagine zooming in on a
masked soldier in Ukraine and being able to tell through
micro-expressions whether they were Russian soldiers or
insurgents]{.underline}. **[Investment into face scanning algorithms,
and a direction as to what these algorithms are searching for, will
revolutionize how nations deal with espionage and terrorist
threats]{.underline}**.

As an enabling technology \[1\], [biotech]{.underline}nology [can be
applied broadly]{.underline}, which is very [important for the economy,
society, and environment]{.underline} \[2\]. Particularly, the
discoveries, invention, and application of biotechnologies are [leading
to the emergence of the bioeconomy]{.underline} \[3--5\]. Nevertheless,
[recent biotechnologies have increasingly generated practical issues and
**regulatory challenges**]{.underline} \[6--8\]. The **[misuse of
biotech]{.underline}**nology [could be harmful to the environment or
biodiversity, and concerns have been raised concerning the uncertainty
of]{.underline} people's health, ethical issues,
**[biosecurity]{.underline}**, etc. \[9\]. At the end of 2018, the
Chinese scientist Jian-Kui He claimed that he had helped create the
world's first genome-edited babies using the CRISPR--Cas9 tool, and this
raised global discussion \[10--12\]. At present, it is not clear what
will happen to the two genome-edited babies, but what is known is that
the scientist was sentenced to prison for 3 years \[13\]. Generally,
**[the development of biotechnology and bioeconomy require the
establishment and improvement of a regulatory framework]{.underline}**
\[3\]. In addition to practice, the development of biotechnology has
received broad interest among researchers \[6,9,14,15\]. Prior studies
have noted the importance of biotechnologyrelated institutions in
various aspects \[9,16--19\], particularly in promoting the development
of biotechnology \[20\]. However, together with the development of
biotechnology, the related institutions also change dynamically.
Although biotechnology potentially generates great benefits, [the cost
implications under certain circumstances might be massive, leading to
public controversies and **the need for intervention by
institutions**]{.underline} \[9\]. The relationship, particularly the
interaction mechanism between biotechnology and institutions, is
underexplored. Therefore, we ask the following research question: What
is the interaction mechanism between biotechnology development and its
institutions? To answer our research question, we select China as a
research context. China, as an emerging developing nation, with the aim
of overtaking the curve, has achieved some improvements in the field of
biotechnology \[14\]. In those years, China has paid
considerableattention to the development of the biotechnology industry
\[21\]. In 2001, the biotechnology industry was listed as a high-tech
industry in the 10th Five-Year Plan of High-tech Industry Development.
In the Mid-Long Term S&T Development Plan (2006--2020), biotechnology is
listed as the first of the eight types of cutting-edge technologies. The
development of biotechnology in China has been very rapid in recent
years. In accordance with the latest statistics by the OECD (key
biotechnology indicators, available online: https://www.oecd.
org/sti/emerging-tech/keybiotechnologyindicators.htm (accessed on 10
March 2022)), in 2018, China accounted for 8.2% of biotechnology patents
from the IP5 patent families (the five largest IP offices in the world,
including the European Patent Office (EPO), the Japan Patent Office
(JPO), the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO), the National
Intellectual Property Administration of the People's Republic of China
(CNIPA), and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)) only
after the US (37.6%) and Japan (12.3%), while the percentage was only
0.8% in 2001. However, the institution that regulates and promotes the
development of biotechnology is not established at first, and
experiences a process to improve. This situation provides a proper
foundation to examine our research question in China's context.

Ethics is the study of what we ought to do; science is the study of how
the world works. Ethics is essential to scientific research in defining
the concepts we use (such as the concept of 'medical need'), deciding
which questions are worth addressing, and what we may do to sentient
beings in research. [The central importance of ethics to science is
exquisitely illustrated by the recent gene editing of two healthy
embryos by the Chinese bio‐ physicist He Jiankui, resulting in the birth
of baby girls born in November 2018, Lulu and Nana. A second pregnancy
is underway with a different couple. To make the babies resistant to
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), He edited out a gene (CCR5) that
produces a protein which allows HIV to enter cells. One girl has both
copies of the gene modified (and may be resistant to HIV), while the
other has only one (making her still susceptible to HIV).1 He Jiankui
invited couples to take part in this experiment where the father was HIV
positive and the mother HIV negative. He offered free in vitro
fertilization (IVF) with sperm washing to avoid transmission of HIV. He
also offered medical insurance, expenses and treatment capped at 280,000
RMB/CNY, equivalent to around \$40,000]{.underline}. The package in‐
cludes health insurance for the baby for an unspecified period. Medical
expenses and compensation arising from any harm caused by the re‐ search
were capped at 50,000 RMB/CNY (\$7000 USD).2 He says this was from his
own pocket.3 Although the parents were offered the choice of having
either gene‐edited or ‐unedited embryos transferred, it is not clear
whether they understood that editing was not necessary to protect their
child from HIV, nor what pressure they felt under. [There has been valid
criticism of the process of obtaining informed consent.4 The information
was complex and probably unintelligible to lay people. The most basic
ethical constraint on research involving humans is that it should not
expose participants to unreasonable risk.5 Risks should be the minimum
necessary to answer the scientific question, and the expected benefits
should be proportionate to expected harms.6 While the Declaration of
Helsinki states that research in‐ volving incompetent participants must
be 'minimal risk and minimal burden',7 this is most plausibly
interpreted as minimal overall risk or burden, where expected benefits
match or outweigh expected harms. After all, children are exposed to
trials of new toxic chemo‐ therapeutic agents with significant risks. In
deciding whether a risk is reasonable, it is important to eval‐ uate not
only the probability of achieving a benefit, but also the ex‐ tent of
the benefit in question. A greater expected benefit is worth greater
risk than a smaller expected benefit. Avoiding HIV is cer‐ tainly a
benefit, but the probability that Lulu and Nana would have contracted
HIV is low. In contrast, the unknown effects of the edit‐ ing could cost
them a normal life. Given our ignorance of the full ramifications of
changing a gene, what could justify taking the risk of a gene‐editing
trial in humans? The answer is, if the embryo had a catastrophic single
gene disorder]{.underline}. Several genetic disorders, such as BRAT 1,
JAM3 and PHGDH, are lethal in the neonatal period, so for embryos with
them, gene editing is potentially life‐saving.8 There is a risk of
off‐target mutations, but the expected harm of such mutations is
arguably no worse than the fate of the unedited embryos. The geneticist
George Church has defended He\'s research on the grounds that HIV is a
public health problem for which there is no cure or vaccine.9 [Church is
right to the extent that there is no prob‐ lem in principle with editing
out the CCR5 gene in the future. What he fails to take into account,
however, is that Lulu and Nana are being used, at great risk, and
without proportionate benefit, when there are more ethical experimental
designs that would meet the need for greater knowledge of the effects of
editing genes. At the conference at which He presented his experiment,
George Daley, the Dean of Harvard Medical School, indicated that
Huntington\'s disease or Tay--Sachs disease might be suitable targets
for gene editing.10 It is not clear whether Daley is endorsing these as
first‐in‐human trials]{.underline}. Huntington\'s disease is very
different to Tay-- Sachs disease. Babies with Tay--Sachs disina ease die
in the first few years of life; people with Huntington\'s disease have
around 40 good years. Hence Tay--Sachs disease is a better candidate for
early trials, as babies with that condition have less to lose. This
mirrors the ratio‐ nale for experimenting with gene therapy on babies
with a lethal form of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency rather
than on adults with a mild form, such as Jesse Gelsinger who lost his
life in a badly designed gene therapy trial in 1999.11 [He Jiankui\'s
trial was unethical, not because it involved gene ed‐ iting, but because
it failed to conform to the basic values and princi‐ ples that govern
all research involving human participants. Further into the future, if
gene editing can be done without off‐ target mutations, it could be used
to address genetic dispositions to common diseases, such as diabetes or
cardiovascular disease. These involve tens or hundreds of genes. In
principle, gene editing could be used to modify many genes accurately.
Gene editing has been suc‐ cessfully employed to remove 62 porcine
endogenous retroviruses from a kidney cell line.12 It is notable that
the first human gene‐edited babies were en‐ hanced to have resistance to
a disease, not to treat an existing disease. In future, perhaps gene
editing will be used to engineer super‐resistance to infectious
threats.]{.underline} At the Second International Summit on Human Genome
Editing, where He revealed his research, the National Academies of
Science, Engineering and Medicine called for a 'translational pathway to
human germ line gene editing'. [In our view, to be ethically
justifiable, such a 'translational pathway' should be: catastrophic
single gene disorders (like Tay--Sachs disease), then severe single gene
disorders (like Huntington\'s disease), then reduction in the genetic
contribu‐ tion to common diseases (like diabetes and cardiovascular
disease), then enhanced immunity and perhaps even delaying
ageing.]{.underline}

#### Regulation of biotechnology is good

**Xue et al. 21** (December 15^th^, 2021 \| Yang Xue, Hanzhi Yu, and
Geng Qin \| "Towards Good Governance on Dual-Use Biotechnology for
Global Sustainable Development" \| <https://doi.org/10.3390/su132414056>
\| DOA: 6/22/2022 \| SAoki)

Under the framework of the above-mentioned principles and objectives,
[the experimentalist governance model requires that grassroot
practitioner should be provided with the power to act in accordance with
local conditions]{.underline}. We believe that [in view of the
characteristics of dual-use biotechnology risks, different countries
need to promote]{.underline} three aspects of work according to their
actual conditions. First, it is important to seek [a dynamic balance
between "hard law" and "soft law".]{.underline} Facing the dual-use risk
of biotechnology, countries need to find a dynamic balance between "hard
law" and "soft law". [Soft law consists of democratic, open, universal
and normative rules through the participation of stakeholders to
regulate the social relations in biosafety governance]{.underline},
including its guidelines, codes, standards, and norms. It is therefore
necessary to protect social and public interests, encourage scientific
and technological research and industrial innovation, and ensure that
the development of dual-use biotechnology is in accordance with the law
and regulations. [Due to the difficulty to meeting the demands for legal
adjustment of new social contradictions caused by the dual-use risk of
biotechnology by simply creating high legislative costs alone, and
existence of complicated biological safety risks, no country has a
panoramic understanding of the possible consequences of such risks,
and]{.underline} some [hidden dangers]{.underline} of such risks are far
from being fully exposed. It will [be increasingly difficult to
supervise biotechnology as it gains momentum]{.underline}, as it is
necessary to keep up with biotechnology through soft law, improving
governance efficiency through "easily adjustable and easily controlled"
mechanisms, and forming a policy reserve of national governance rules.
Noticeably, integrating hard and soft law to create a prevention network
needs a dynamic adjustment mechanism \[54\]. The most valuable,
promising results of dual-use biotechnology are often produced in the
early stage of research. Therefore, application of soft law, such as a
code of conduct and professional rules, should initiallypredominate. [As
new technologies are being industrialized,]{.underline} [**regulation**
through hard law should be strengthened.]{.underline} Second, to develop
a dynamic consultant mechanism with multi-stakeholders in accordance
with specific national conditions, [the governance of emerging
tech]{.underline}nologies [should be the final outcome of interactions
of socio-political management under the collective consultation of
social actors]{.underline} \[55\]. This interactive mechanism should
balance and coordinate the views and propositions between scientists and
other stakeholders, thus deepening trust and integration. At the same
time, biotechnologist can be encouraged to discuss issues such as social
risk, which will be an important part of their scientific research
activities in the future \[56\]. When such interactions produce a mutual
understanding and shared vision, these biologists will form an
"autonomous network" in which several entities and regulatory agencies
will pool their social resources, intellectual expertise and interests
\[57\]. With the advancement of dual-use biotechnology, [this autonomous
network must have the capability of dynamic learning and **adaptive**
capacity]{.underline}. [Multi-level organizations]{.underline},
including government regulatory departments, scientific research
institutions, and industrial associations [should carry out popularize
science to **improve the public understanding** of dual-use
biotechnology, enhancing **enthusiasm** for participating in and
supervising the development of dual-use biotechnology]{.underline}.
[These activities can **build public confidence** in dual-use
biotechnology and create a social environment more conducive to its
sustained and healthy development.]{.underline} In short, [government
supervision should mobilize social forces]{.underline}, promote the
orderly participation [in]{.underline} the [governance of]{.underline}
the [dual-use risk of biotech]{.underline}nology so that those social
forces will jointly assume responsibility, formulate the rules, minimize
risks and share in the outcome. Third, to implement dynamic supervision
of hierarchical management and risk assessment according to actual
needs, [each country should engage in hierarchical
management]{.underline} and provide dynamic supervision mechanism for
risk assessment. The idea of implementing hierarchical management of
risks in the field of biosafety has become a common choice of major
countries throughout the world yet have different characteristics. The
"Biosafety Law of the People's Republic of China" of 2020, emphasizes
that "the state implements classified management on biotechnology
research and development activities," and that biotechnology research
and development activities should be classified into high-, mediumand
low-risk categories according to the amount of harm these activities may
cause to public health, industry, agriculture, and the environment
\[58\]. The "Dual-Use Research of Concern" (DURC), conducted by the
National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB), focuses on 15
hazardous biological agents or toxins and seven types of partial
dual-use research \[2\]. Furthermore, according to a country's own
situation, [it is necessary to develop risk assessment models by means
of scenario analysis for policy makers to formulate and revise the laws
and regulations]{.underline} \[59,60\]. In 2012, Bansak and Tucker
proposed a 3 × 3 matrix model for risk assessment of dual-use
biotechnology based on two key variables: abuse risk and controllability
(Table 1). They then divided the abuse risk variables into four types:
availability, vulnerability, potential hazard, and potential abuse
crisis. The abuse risk can be high, medium, or low. Countries can modify
the key variables of the model as needed.

Abstract: [Dual-use **biotechnology** faces the risks of
**availability**, novel **biological agents**, knowledge,]{.underline}
normative, [and other]{.underline} dual-use [risks. If left unchecked,
these may **destroy human living conditions** and **social order**.
Despite the benefits]{.underline} of dual-use technology, [**good
governance** is needed to **mitigate its risks**]{.underline}. The
predicaments facing all governments in managing the dual-use risks of
biotechnology deserve special attention. On the one hand, the
[information asymmetry risk of dual-use biotechnology prevents the
traditional self-governance model]{.underline} in the field of
biotechnology from playing its role. [On the other hand, **top-down**
public regulation often **lags behind** technological **iteration** due
to the **difficulty of predicting** the human-made risks of dual-use
biotechnology.]{.underline} Therefore, we argue that governance of the
dual-use risks of biotechnology should avoid the traditional bottom-up
or top-down modes. We suggest the governance for dual-use biotechnology
could be improved if the four-stage experimentalist governance model is
followed. The first stage is to achieve consensus on a broad governance
framework with open-ended principles. The second stage is for countries
to take action based on local conditions and the open-ended framework.
The third stage is to establish a dynamic consultation mechanism for
transnational information sharing and action review. The fourth and
final stage is to evaluate and revise the global governance framework.
New [dual-use biotechnology, represented by **gene editing**,
**synthetic biology**, and **gene driving**, has brought great benefits
to human health and welfare, but may]{.underline} also [be used for the
development of **biological weapons** or **bioterrorism**]{.underline}.
The international community recognizes the [potential social and
economic benefits of dual-use biotechnology, but it is difficult to
prevent this technology from being **misused** or
**abused**]{.underline}. What are the risks of dual-use biotechnology?
What are the difficulties and challenges in the current risk management
system, and can they be resolved? This paper explores these questions to
deepen our understanding of the risks of dual-use biotechnology and
countermeasures so that such technology can benefit sustainable
development of humanity. Keywords: risks of dual-use biotechnology;
double predicament; experimentalist governance model 1. Dual-Use Risks
of Biotechnology and Countermeasures 1.1. Definition of "Dual-Use
Biotechnology" In the military field, ["dual-use" biotechnology refers
to both **civilian** and **military technology**]{.underline} \[1\]. In
the civilian field, it refers to [a legitimate scientific purpose that
yields information or technologies]{.underline} that [may be misused to
pose a threat to **public health** or other aspects of **national
security**]{.underline} \[2\]. [Dual-use biotechnology has
**benefits**]{.underline} (such as promoting scientific progress or
improving public health) [but also has the potential for]{.underline}
malicious abuse or misuse (such as **[bioterrorism]{.underline}**). At
present, internationally recognized dual-use biotechnology consists of
technology used for acquiring new types of biological or molecular
materials (combinatorial chemistry and high throughput screening, DNA
shuffling, and directed evolution), directed design technologies
(protein engineering, virus genome synthesis, standardization in
synthetic biology), technologies for manipulating biological systems
(development of psychoactive drugs, synthesis of peptide bioregulators,
immune regulation, personal genomics, RNA interference, transcranial
magnetic stimulation), and technologies for the packaging and delivery
(chemical micro-processing equipment, gene therapy, aerosol vaccine).
Tucker lists three [characteristics of dual-use:]{.underline} (1) its
[**technical attributes**, including **availability**, **abuse
susceptibility** and **potential harm** caused by abuse]{.underline};
(2) its **[controllability]{.underline}**, including
[concretization]{.underline} (the materialization of technology),
[maturity, convergence, development speed and international
diffusion]{.underline}; [and]{.underline} (3) the [**reducibility** to
the state, institutional, individual, product and knowledge
levels]{.underline} \[3\]. However, due to its ubiquity, it is difficult
to manage the risks of all dual-use biotechnologies. Therefore, NSABB
has adopted a strategy of determining a limited scope of knowledge,
products or technologies produced by life science research that is most
likely to be misused to threaten national biosafety. This part of
research is referred to as "dual-use research concerns", and encompasses
15 key biological agents or toxins and seven types of dual-use research
\[4\]. 1.2. Four Types of Risks of Dual-Use Biotechnology Tucker \[3\]
categorized four abusable risks of dual-use biotechnology in his book
Innovation, Dual-use and Safety: Managing the Risks of Emerging
Biological and Chemical Technologies. These risks are availability,
novel biological agent, knowledge, and normative. 1.2.1. Accessibility
Risks [Accessibility is the difficulty in obtaining **dual-use
biotechnology**. It is the first step of the **intentional misuse** of
biotechnology, including obtaining hardware, software, and intangible
information that can be applied to such technology for **non-state
actors** to carry out **bioterrorism activities**. In the field of
dual-use biotechnology, non-state actors can include **ethnic
separatists**, **transnational criminal organizations**, **terrorist
organizations**, **cults**, **biohackers**, and others who engage in
covert behavior, have more freedom to conduct research, and are more
**difficult to supervise** than state actors.]{.underline} At the Eighth
Review Conference of the Convention on the Prohibition of Biological
Weapons, the U.S. government announced that bioterrorism plots had been
foiled by Kenya and Morocco. In addition, more than 15 criminal cases in
the past ten years have involved the use of biological weapons in the
U.S. [There is therefore increasing concern over **non-state actors**
using **dual-use biotechnology** to carry out **bioterrorist
attacks**]{.underline} \[5\]. There are three accessibility risks of
dual-use biotechnology. One is the [disclosure of **key technical
information**, such as key **gene sequences** of highly pathogenic
**pathogens**]{.underline} that [can be easily obtained]{.underline}
from academic conferences, journals and public databases. In 2011,
scientists from the United States and the Netherlands published academic
papers on the transmission ability of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza
virus in mammalian cells, in which the methods of modifying the virus so
as to enhance its transmission ability were made public \[6\]. This
event that triggered global concern about the dual-use risk of
biotechnology \[7\]. In addition, [it is now **easier than ever** to
obtain **key experimental materials**]{.underline}. In light of the
industrialization of biotechnology, biotechnology enterprises can
provide technical services and related reagents, including the detailed
steps of entire experiments. Anyone can readily order laboratory
equipment, consumables and substitutes online, and each year these
become less expensive, so it is not difficult to set up a simple biology
laboratory \[8\]. Finally, there are more ways than ever to obtain
technology. More methods of communication have emerged outside of
traditional channels in recent years, including the International
Genetic Engineering Machine Competition (iGEM) and other international
biology academic competitions, as well as online forums such as DIY
biology. 1.2.2. Novel Biological Agent Risks [Novel agent risks are the
identification or development of **new biological agents** or **toxins**
with the assistance of dual-use biotechnology.]{.underline} These risks
also encompass "gain of function" research into **[pathogenic
viruses]{.underline}**, including combinatorial chemistry,
high-throughput screening, DNA shuffling, directed evolution or protein
engineering \[3\]. For example, [**gene editing** technology,
represented by **CRISPER**]{.underline}-Cas9, [can greatly change the
biological traits of pathogens, animals and plants]{.underline}, and
even humans in a short time. Gene synthesis technology can artificially
[resurrect extinct **pathogenic viruses**, so that bacteria and viruses
with higher pathogenicity can be synthesized, the receptors of which may
have **unprecedented biological characteristics**]{.underline} \[9\]. In
2018, Canadian scientists obtained overlapping gene fragments through
mail order, splicing them to synthesize a horse pox virus which was
similar to the smallpox virus \[10\]. [These artificially synthesized
viruses are more capable of **infecting**, **spreading**, **killing**,
and **escaping** than natural viruses, so it is more difficult to
**trace their origins**]{.underline}. In addition, RNA interference and
personal genomics, realized by [gene driving technology,
may]{.underline} not only [be used as **crowd-specific weapons** to
reduce **human reproductive capacity**]{.underline} and change the
number of specific human populations, [but also]{.underline} be used to
[manufacture **insect weapons** for transnational transmission
of]{.underline} dengue fever, [**Zika**, and other
**diseases**]{.underline}. 1.2.3. Knowledge Risks Knowledge risks
reflect the fact that as human understanding of life science at the
molecular and system levels deepens, research may be abused to attack
knowledge loopholes. For example, the study of immune regulation is
intended to improve human immunity to infectious diseases. However, [a
specific pathogen can be **modified** through engineering to **bypass**
acquired or innate **immune barriers**]{.underline}, while [importing
immunosuppressants and biological weapons into specific populations to
achieve the double purpose of **reducing immunity** and causing
**disease**]{.underline} \[11\]. In addition, [dual-use biotechnology
can be used to subvert traditional weapons and equipment and attack the
weaknesses in national defense military facilities]{.underline}. For
example, at the Eighth Review Conference of the States Parties to the
United Nations Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), the U.S. military
revealed that it had been able to use gene synthesis technology to
produce material damage factors aimed at non-living substances. Such
non-traditional weapons can attack "rubber and metal parts, fuel, food
and equipment", accelerate the corrosion of rubber and metal parts of
weapons, and destroy military fuel, supplies, instruments and equipment
\[5\]. In theory, [gene drive technology could be used to **reduce human
reproductive capacity** and alter the size of **specific human
populations**]{.underline} \[12\]. In recent years, [biological
scientists]{.underline} in the United States, Europe, and other
developed countries [have repeatedly called for appropriate biosafety
precautions to minimize the uncertain risks of **gene drive
technologies**]{.underline} to the environment, plants and animals, and
human health \[13\]. 1.2.4. Normative Risks Normative risks use dual-use
biotechnology to destroy the framework of international biosafety
governance conventions, including the Biological Weapons Convention
(BWC). For example, new neuropeptide biological agents that can
influence and manipulate specific wills or emotions have been
manufactured. These agents can induce visual or auditory hallucinations,
and cause disability or even extreme hysteria during interrogation,
violating the human rights of detainees and breaking international
humanitarian law. Normative risks also concern the self-regulation of
scientists. In 2018, He Jiankui of China's Southern University of
Science and Technology created the world's first gene-edited infant, in
violation of the international regulation that "gene-edited early human
embryos (within 14 days of age) and germ cells should not be used for
pregnancy." Normative risks also involve the application of dual-use
biotechnology to existing international ethical principles and norms. He
Jiankui violated the Helsinki Declaration, the International Ethical
Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects, and other
international ethics, and principles and common views designed to
"respect and protect subjects, maximize subject benefit and avoid
subject injury as much as possible" \[14\]. 1.3. National Responses to
Dual-Use Risks of Biotechnology From the perspective of global practice
and international experience, the rules of governance towards dual-use
risks of biotechnology consist of hard and soft laws. "Hard laws" are
conventions, laws and regulations that are enforced using national
coercive power. "Soft laws" are democratic, open, universal and
normative rules formulated and recognized through extensive
participation and joint consultation of all social parties, including
codes of conduct and professional self-discipline. Hard and soft rules
are not mutually exclusive. For example, the effectiveness of voluntary
standards and guidelines can be strengthened through the enforcement of
criminal law or tort law so as to punish harm caused by accidental or
intentional abuse \[15\]. By the end of the 20th century, all countries
had begun to pay attention to the four risks caused by dual-use
biotechnology. In "Biotechnology, Weapons, and Humanity" (1999), the
British Medical Association, for the first time in its history,
expressed concern about the malicious abuse of genetic engineering,
biotechnology and other emerging technologies, and suggested that social
supervision should be strengthened and moral standards be established
within the sciences to prevent the exacerbation of potential risks. In
2002, the Chinese government promulgated the "Regulations on Export
Control of Dual-use Biological Products and Related Equipment and
Technologies" to restrict the export of dual-use biological products and
related equipment and technologies, to prevent them from being used to
manufacture biological weapons \[16\]. In 2003, the National Academy of
Sciences of the United States released a report, "Biotechnology Research
in the Era of Terrorism" (the Fink Report), a pioneering document of the
research into national security risks in the field of life science. The
Fink Report identified seven types of biological experiments with
dual-use risks, including microbiology and molecular biology
experiments, which require safety inspections before project approval
and funding \[17\]. To this end, the U.S. government set up a federal
advisory committee under the National Biosafety Scientific Advisory
Committee, which took charge of formulating policies and recommendations
on dual-use research concerns (DURC) in life science research \[2\]. In
2004, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that "every major
new technology can be used not only for peaceful purposes, but also for
hostile purposes. To tackle the common security challenges to all
mankind, we should put the protection of biotechnology from being
maliciously used above the security interests of all countries." In
2009, the European Union passed Regulation No. 428/2009, which listed
the controlled goods subject to export restrictions and licenses,
including dual-use biological materials and production equipment \[18\].
In the same year, the Federation of American Societies for Experimental
Biology (FASEB) warned that "scientists who educate their research on
potential dual-use shall pay more attention to taking necessary safety
control measures" \[19\]. Since 2011, countries have paid more attention
to the dual-use of biotechnology. After the research results on genetic
modification of H5N1, the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
published in "Nature" in September 2011 triggered global controversy.
The United States issued several regulatory policies concerning dual-use
biotechnology, including the "Regulatory Policy on Dual-use Life Science
Research of the U.S. Government" (2012) by the National Science Advisory
Board for Biosecurity (NSABB), and the "Regulatory Policy of
Dual-Purpose Research Institutions in Life Sciences of the U.S.
Government" (2013) by Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)
\[20\]. In 2014, NSABB halted research on the Gain of Function of highly
pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) viruses, and required
all independent and federal research institutions to strictly abide by
the "Dual-use Research of Concern" (DURC) from 24 September 2015, and
established a special entity review body, the IRE. In 2015, the U.S.
government established the "Institutional Regulatory Policy Concerning
Dual-use Research in Life Sciences" \[21\]. In 2018, the U.S. government
issued a "National Biodefense Strategy," and the National Academy of
Sciences of the United States released the report "Biodefense in the Age
of Synthetic Biology", which emphasized the imminent threat of synthetic
biotechnology being used as a virus weapon for terrorist activities by
biohackers \[22\]. In 2017, the Chinese government issued "Safety
Management Measures for Biotechnology Research and Development" to
impose special control measures for biotechnology research and
development activities with high risks of causing serious diseases in
humans or animals \[23\]. While strengthening supervision at home, some
countries have begun to mitigate the dual-use risks of biotechnology on
international governance platforms. In 2016, the United States and
Britain submitted Working Papers No. 10, No. 14, and No. 17 to the
General Assembly at the Eighth Review Conference of the States Parties
to the BWC. Germany submitted 'Control Measures of Dual-use Materials'
at the preparatory meeting, which emphasized that the dual-use of new
biotechnology poses a greater threat of large-scale epidemics and
bioterrorism \[24--27\]. The management of dual-use risks of
biotechnology was put on the international agenda and became a hot topic
in the field of international arms control. To counter the possible
abuse and misuse of biotechnology, Working Paper No. 30, jointly
submitted by the Chinese and Pakistani governments, proposed the
formulation of a model code of conduct for biological scientists. It
would be binding upon all biological scientists worldwide when
conducting biological research. In this important meeting, the state
parties agreed to "encourage the promotion of a culture of
responsibility amongst relevant national professionals and the voluntary
development, adoption and promulgation of codes of conduct" \[28\]. At
the international level, UN Security Council Resolution 1540 has been
passed as the principled framework, BWC has been adopted as the basic
norm, and international export control standards have been established
by informal associations, including Australia Group and similar
organizations. These conventions and standards have been adopted by the
international community, and have been enshrined in laws, regulations
and operational mechanisms, including China's "Regulations on Export
Control of Dual-use Biological Products and Related Equipment and
Technologies", the U.S. "Regulations on Export Administration", and
Australia Group's "Guiding Principles on Export Control of Biosensitive
Items". 2. Double Predicament: Challenge of Governing Dual-Use
Biotechnology Although the public now has a clearer understanding of the
risks posed by dual-use biotechnology, and the international community
has made great efforts to mitigate those risks, [disputes over safety
and ethics are still common in **formulating governance policies**
worldwide]{.underline}. In the field of stem cell research, the Japanese
government revised its "Treatment Policy for Specific Embryos" in 2019,
which approved research on cultivating human organs for transplantation
in animals by implanting human stem cells into animal embryos. At the
same time, it lifted restrictions on the termination of humananimal
chimeric embryos within 14 days and restrictions on implanting those
embryos into surrogate uteruses \[29\]. Such embryos may develop into
human-animal chimeras, raising ethical disputes over the blurring of
boundaries between human and non-human animals. [The cause of the
governance disputes is that dual-use biotechnology entails **human-made
risks** that are difficult to control in addition to **information
asymmetry risks**]{.underline}. As a result, the traditional
self-governance of the biotechnology industry is placed in a predicament
where [it is **difficult for governance models to keep up with** the
development of **emerging technologies**]{.underline}. 2.1. Predicament
1: The Information Asymmetry Risk of Dual-Use Biotechnology Keeps the
Traditional Self-Governance Model in the Field of Biotechnology from
Playing Its Role In contrast to the field of nuclear technology, in the
biological sciences, the autonomy of stakeholders is important \[30\].
[The biotechnology industry has a long tradition of
self-governance]{.underline}, and there are many historical success
stories. [However]{.underline}, the **[information
asymmetry]{.underline}** risk [of dual-use biotechnology has caused
problems for]{.underline} the traditional model of **[industry
self-governance]{.underline}**. Dual-use risks of biotechnology show
obvious characteristics of information asymmetry. Since the [research
and development environment and application scenario of dual-use
biotechnology are **concealed**, **anonymous** and
**opaque**]{.underline}, the public may not be able to ac-quire enough
information about the dual-use risk of biotechnology. The two hidden
risks of information asymmetry are as follows. The research of
[scientists who have mastered dual-use biotechnology cannot be monitored
effectively by the institutions]{.underline} with which they are
affiliated. This could [pose risks to **national
biosafety**]{.underline} and public safety. Moreover, [is difficult to
supervise the application of dual-use biotechnology in the early
stages]{.underline} of disease diagnosis and treatment, as well as drug
research and development. In response to these information asymmetry
risks, professionals in the life sciences have always emphasized
enhancing professional internal supervision mechanisms, but this may
worsen information asymmetry. Researchers concerned with dual-use
biotechnology acquire their professional skills in a closed environment,
at scientific conferences, under the guidance of risk or ethics expert
committees, and peer review of papers submitted for publication. All of
these have formed an enclosed internal supervision mechanism for
research, training and practice. These monitoring mechanisms determine
that the identification and judgment of dual-use risks of biotechnology
depend on the expert group from within the system, which may have some
negative effects. For example, the internal standards and operational
mechanisms within the scientific community may exclude the concerns,
doubts and interventions of the government and the public. Even the
judicial system, as a third party with traditional punitive capability,
should rely on the judgment standards and operational systems
established by the life science community in resolving legal disputes
caused by the misuse of dual-use biotechnology. Furthermore,
[biotechnology implementers who tend to be **self-governing** within the
industry will resort to **information asymmetry** to **deliberately
resist**]{.underline} the design of the **[public power]{.underline}**
system, which exacerbates the dual-use risks of biotechnology. Some
[biological scientists reject the top-down public power supervision
system]{.underline}, which is most obvious in the field of synthetic
biology research. Some technical experts in this field believe that
[supervision by public authorities can't keep up with the pace of
technological change]{.underline}, and that the bottom-up industry
self-regulation is superior to the traditional "hard law" in terms of
time cost, and will be less likely to be resisted by practitioners
\[31\]. However, [bottom-up **industry self-regulation**, or other
self-regulation modes, have **failed to regulate** the malicious abuse
of the **synthetic technology** of **known pathogenic viruses**. It is
also difficult for such self-regulation models to accommodate the
greater risks caused by the creation of synthetic organisms]{.underline}
based on standardized component methods. In addition, excessive reliance
on industry self-regulation will easily lead to the public's
misunderstanding of biotechnology development. Thus, the public may tend
to believe that biotechnology development will undermine social
consensus on biotechnology development and restrict the sustained and
rapid progress of biotechnology if scientists assume certain
technological risks after taking internal decisions to lift restrictions
in some areas of research without having arrived and an informed
consensus with the public. The public can do nothing except express
doubt in the technology once such risks arise. The He Jiankui incident
of 2018 was an international controversy for two reasons. He violated
institutional and international research regulations when he applied
CRISPERCas9 gene editing technology to editing human embryos, and he
conducted his experiments while claiming to be working on a cure for
AIDS. As the public expects diseases to be cured and people to live
longer, the internal private domain in life sciences will contradict
public opinions on safety risk management and control. In a larger
sense, different stakeholders have different understandings of and
demands for the risks of dual-use biotechnology among biological
scientists, social science experts, industries, media and the public.
2.2. Predicament 2: [Top-Down Public Regulation often **Lags behind**
Technological Iteration]{.underline} Due to Difficulty in the Prediction
of Human-Made Risks of Dual-Use Biotechnology [It is **difficult to
predict** the **human-made risks** of dual-use
biotechnology]{.underline} before it has been used. According to
Giddens, scientific and technological risk is a kind of "man-made risk"
\[32\], and technology is neither good nor evil in itself. People use
technology for good or evil purposes. Compared with the risk of public
health and safety, [the risk of biotechnological dual-use depends more
on the **intention** and **ability** of its users.]{.underline}
Therefore, the cause of biotechnology dual-use risk is stakeholders'
behavior out of control under the comprehensive influence of both the
internal and external environment. While human beings are innovating
dual-use biotechnology, they are endeavoring to modify the rules that
should apply to it. However, [since]{.underline} the human-made [risks
of]{.underline} dual-use [biotechnology cannot be
predicted]{.underline}, since [it is easy to find loopholes in rules and
policies, and]{.underline} since traditional "**[hard
law]{.underline}**" and other governance rules [are **slow to adjust**,
governance **innovation cannot keep up** with technology]{.underline}.
The hope is that once governance rules are established, they will be
able to keep pace with technological changes by [establishing a system
of adaptive governance for continuous technology
evaluation]{.underline}. With the development of dual-use biotechnology
[and the deepening understanding of its risks]{.underline}, these
methods usually [require a cycle of data collection, evaluation and
**rule modification**]{.underline} \[33\]. In other words, [new
scientific discoveries and knowledge]{.underline} in other fields [must
be applied to the **iterative decision-making** of the dual-use risk of
biotechnology]{.underline} \[34\]. However, such governance innovation
ideas tend to challenge the scientific formulation of risk governance.
In summary, the risk of information asymmetry of dual-use biotechnology
has placed the traditional biotechnology industry self-governance model
in trouble; at the same time, the difficulty of predicting the
human-made risks of dual-use biotechnology leads to public regulation
lagging behind technical iteration. [The result is **failed governance**
of **dual-use risks** of biotechnology]{.underline}. In the 1920s,
Ogburn observed that as technology advanced, people's habits, thoughts
and social arrangements fell behind, resulting in the decisive influence
of technology on society \[35\]. The social reality since World War II
has demonstrated that social harmony exists only in the minds of
idealists. In contrast, heterogeneity is a basic feature of modern
society. On this premise, [the predicament of the management of dual-use
risk of biotechnology reflects a failure in the **checks and balances**
of the **social governance structure**]{.underline}. The [risk
governance rules cannot cover]{.underline} the ~~blind~~ [\[unseen\]
spots of **non-state actors** and all **biotechnology R and D and
application** scenarios]{.underline}. It is difficult for the system
design mechanism to balance and coordinate the viewpoints and
propositions in the life sciences and social sciences, in addition to
finding a consensus among all parties. The balance between technology
iteration and governance rules, and between private subjects' demands
and social consensus is consequently lost.

### 2AC -- BCI Impact Ext

#### BCI is 10 times more likely to be an existential risk than nuclear war

**Rafferty 20** (Jack Rafferty, Co-founder of the Lead Exposure
Elimination Project and published researcher on X-Risk, with a focus on
longterm global totalitarianism. Effective Altruism, \"A New X-Risk
Factor: Brain-Computer
Interfaces\", 8/10/2020, https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qfDeCGxBTFhJANAWm/a-new-x-risk-factor-brain-computer-interfaces-1#3_6_Likelihood_of_Lasting_Indefinitely, accessed
on 6/23/2022)//gideon

This section will offer [a conservative fermi estimate of the
**existential risk from BCI**]{.underline} in the next 100 years. We use
the same framework used by Toby Ord to assess other existential risks
(2020). The following sections (3.2 to 3.6) will unpack and justify the
estimates taken in this section.

Ord outlines two methods of being conservative with risks. One method is
to underrate our assumptions such that we don't overestimate the
likelihood of a risk. Another way is overrating likelihood such that we
don't accidentally act in a negative way. When guiding action, the
second approach is far more useful, as it is more prudent and more
likely to avoid catastrophic failure. However, to make the strongest
case possible, in this paper I will be using the second approach; and
will show that [even with our **most conservative**, lower-bound
assumptions, the risk from BCI is]{.underline} significant. In fact, our
risk estimate would need to be almost an order of magnitude lower
(\~**[10X]{.underline}**) to be on par with [the]{.underline}
probability Ord assigns to [existential risk from **nuclear
war**]{.underline} in the next 100 years

#### BCIs are an impact multiplier for AI -- allows superintelligence to literally control our bodies

**Nørgaard and Linden-Vørnle 21** (Katrine Nørgaard and Michael

The article falls in four parts: The first part presents some basic
concepts and definitions of cyborg technologies and neuroweapons as part
of an emerging neuroscientific security discourse. The second part of
the article sets the general framework and context of multi-domain
warfare in which these technologies are shaped and applied as military
capabilities. The third part introduces the concepts of \'collaborative
risk mediation\' and \'composite intentionality\' stressing the mutual
entanglement and \'interference\' of human and artificial intelligence
in the emerging domain of neurospace. In the last part of the article,
we address the urgent need of governing principles and guidelines,
including the legal and ethical aspects of cyborg warfare. Thus, we call
for interdisciplinary discussion of the emergent frontiers and practices
of neurospace and the negotiation of neuroethical standards in the
international security community. At the center of these discussions, we
pose the question of \'meaningful human control\' and responsibility in
networked military command.

The Neuroscientific Security Discourse and the Realm of the Cyborg
Warrior

As a first step in our inquiry, we need to distinguish between
neurotechnology, which is used to detect, affect, and target human brain
activity (e.g.: improve, repair, degrade or manipulate cognitive
skills), on the one hand, and AI, which is used in computers, sensors,
and robotic systems, on the other hand. A \'neural network\' is a
specific form of AI, consisting of a set of algorithms resembling the
working human brain. A \'neuron\' in a neural network is a mathematical
function that collects and classifies information according to a
specific architecture (Chen 2019). Neurocognitive or cyborg networks, on
the other hand, are hybrid systems of human and artificial intelligence,
i.e. brain-computer networks that integrate the cognitive advantages of
humans and computers. For many years, the two sciences, [the science of
the human brain and the science of AI, have developed side by
side,]{.underline} mutually inspiring and informing each other. [Now,
the scientific exploration of **neurotechnology and AI is rapidly
converging**]{.underline} [and accelerating]{.underline} the development
of n[eural feedback systems that allow a two-way
communication]{.underline} stream [between the]{.underline} human [brain
and]{.underline} the [computer]{.underline}. [The convergence of AI and
neurotechnology and the implications of]{.underline}
**[integrating]{.underline}**, [not just combining or \'teaming\' human
and machine cognition]{.underline},\[4\] is the focus of our interest.
[Humans and computers work together]{.underline} everywhere. This is not
new. However, [until recently they have done so as separate
entities]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} **[separation is beginning to
erode]{.underline}**, as [ubiquitous **AI and neurotechnological
advances** have **made the distinction between human and machine
cognition unclear and** in some cases even **obsolete**.]{.underline}
When we refer to [\'cyborg and neurocognitive weapons
systems\']{.underline}, and [not just one or the other]{.underline}, it
is [precisely because]{.underline} we want to stress [this increasing
interference of human and non-human cognition, which goes]{.underline}
**[way beyond]{.underline}** - and has to be distinguished from - [other
**hybrid tech**nologies such as bionic limbs and advanced hearing or
visual aids]{.underline}.

For this same reason, it is important not to confuse the notion of the
cyborg warrior with the concept of the \'centaur warfighter\' (Scharre
2018: 321), which is often used as a metaphor for human-machine teaming.
The two concepts are closely related, but not synonymous. This
distinction can be expressed as the difference between integration and
automation of machine intelligence, perception, and reasoning. Whereas
[centaur human-machine teaming]{.underline} [consists of humans plus
machines]{.underline}, [with machines performing]{.underline} clearly
[demarcated automated functions]{.underline}, the [cyborg warrior
functions as a neurally enhanced and integrated system
architecture,\[]{.underline}5\] **[merging human and machine
cognition]{.underline}**. [Centaur human-machine teaming does
not]{.underline} necessarily [imply]{.underline} [cognitive or sensory
enhancement]{.underline} of the human operator. [Human and machine
cognition is not neurally integrated]{.underline}. Instead, [humans and
machines perform different]{.underline} role-specific [tasks that
are]{.underline} largely [based on]{.underline} [predetermined decision
models where the machine\'s role is conditioned by]{.underline} one or
more [rule sets]{.underline} (Murray & Yanagi 2015: 17).

As opposed to centaur human-machine teaming, [cyborgs have no
preprogrammed role specifications but adapt continuously]{.underline} to
shifting situations and demands in the operational environment.
According to Kline and Clynes (1961), [such systems can be]{.underline}
regarded as **[\'cybernetic organisms]{.underline}**\' (i.e. cyborgs) in
that they [entail both natural and artificial systems that are
functional, portable, and]{.underline}/or [**biologically
integrated**]{.underline} (Wurzman & Giordano 2015: 90). As such,
[cybernetic and cyborg systems can be]{.underline} seen as
[\"sophisticated distributed human-machine networks]{.underline}, such
as [integrated software or robotic augmentations]{.underline} to
human-controlled activity, [that would **fuse and coordinate** the
distinct cognitive advantages of **humans and computers**]{.underline}\"
(Wurzman & Giordano 2015: 90). Consequently, [cyborg
technologies]{.underline} used in a networked risk environment will
\"[reflect a combination of autonomous initiative and original problem
solving by both human and machine]{.underline}. [This means **shared
agency and responsibility** in military decisions]{.underline}\" (Murray
& Yanagi 2015: 17).

[The attribution of shared agency and responsibility to humans and
machines is central to the definition of cyborg and neurocognitive
weapons]{.underline} systems [and demarcates a shift from automated
decision]{.underline} support [to]{.underline} [collaborative
information]{.underline} and risk [management]{.underline}, with human
and machine intelligence mediating and co-shaping the perception,
organization, and distribution of risk. The advantage of [such
systems]{.underline} is [increased flexibility and accountability
insuring human judgment and responsibility]{.underline} over engagements
[while simultaneously leveraging the precision and speed of
AI.]{.underline} [This]{.underline} [becomes]{.underline} particularly
[urgent when cyborg tech]{.underline}nologies [are]{.underline} used as
[offensive]{.underline} weapons systems (Murray & Yanagi 2015: 17).

In the light of the above, it becomes clear that Malevolent
Cyborgization (MC) could be desirable for a wide range of stakeholders
with a heterogeneous set of goals. There is even an overlapping between
possible entities, which could be interested in MC and those eligible
for MAI as described by Pistono and Yampolskiy. In the following, we
first take up the exemplary stakeholders for MAI mentioned in their
paper and indicate which motives could justify them likewise as
stakeholders for MC showing the parallels between those two phenomena.
Thereafter, we introduce additional global effects specific to MC and
differing from the MAI scenario.

**[Military]{.underline}**: As already mentioned in the introduction,
[the military could **maliciously employ cyborg soldiers** similarly as
MAIs "to achieve dominance" through intellectual, strategical or/and
possibly physical superiority.]{.underline}

**[Governments]{.underline}**: Through cyborgization, [governments could
acquire intellectual superiority]{.underline} with the same intentions
as for the MAI case: "[to **establish hegemony, control people, or take
down other governments**]{.underline}". Note that these [goals
can]{.underline} also [be reached through]{.underline} a [forced
cyborgization]{.underline} of inferior quality carried out by
governments [on people with the aim to **subjugate** them]{.underline}
(e.g. [a kind of digital lobotomy]{.underline} suppressing the
functionality of the frontal cortex, [**body hijacking** or an automatic
red-out of personal information **using BCI data**]{.underline} could be
possible).

**[Corporations]{.underline}**: The authors state the following motives
for the MAI case: "[trying to achieve **monopoly**, destroying the
competition through illegal means]{.underline}." As cyborgs with
enhanced intelligence could be able to process considerably more
information than non-enhanced humans, the transparency on the market may
suffer of it allowing them to take over and build monopolies in
different fields, which is again similar to the MAI goals.

**[Villains]{.underline}**: Following Pistono and Yampolskiy, possible
goals why a MAI could be desirable for [villains]{.underline} are:
"[trying to take over the world]{.underline} and [us]{.underline}ing [AI
as a dominance tool]{.underline}". In the case of MC, the same goals
would be valid except that [Cyborgization will be used]{.underline}
primarily as means [rather than AI.]{.underline} (But obviously,
**[cyborgs]{.underline}** of all the eligible entities could also
**[merge with AI]{.underline}**, [which would represent]{.underline}
**[an extremely risky scenario]{.underline}**. We will analyze this
matter later in the next section).

**[Black Hats]{.underline}**: Through their enhanced
cognition/intelligence, [cyborgs]{.underline} could have an
[enhanced]{.underline} ability to detect [security holes]{.underline} at
their disposal [and could]{.underline} for instance [develop better
heuristics for password-guessing]{.underline}. [They migh]{.underline}t
therefore, likewise black hats with a MAI, secretly attempt "to [steal
information, resources **or destroy cyberinfrastructure**]{.underline}
targets".

**[Doomsday Cults]{.underline}**: The goal of "attempting [to bring the
**end of the world by any means**]{.underline}" using a MAI can
obviously also build a basis for cyborgs involved in doomsday cults.

**[Depressed]{.underline}**: Depressed [cyborgs]{.underline} could hand
over the liability for their live or death to their artificial part e.g.
by [set]{.underline}ting [a self-destruction mode stopping vital
functions in the brain]{.underline}. They could thereby reach the goal
to commit suicide such as depressed people using MAI to be able to
"commit suicide by AI".

**[\*Malicious individuals]{.underline}**: As described in the
introduction, \*malicious individuals could be interested in
cyborgization to be able to [manipulate and control others]{.underline}.
Moreover, [\*malicious individuals could wish to]{.underline}
historically [gain notoriety]{.underline} with regard to their
wrongdoings. The aim to "[trying to **add their name to history books in
any way possible**]{.underline}" seems to not only be a possible
motivation for MAI, but also for MC.

**[Criminals]{.underline}**: According to the authors, criminals could
attempt "to [develop **proxy systems** to avoid risk and
responsibility]{.underline}". The same is possible in the MC scenario.
[A malevolent cyborg could]{.underline} for instance [wirelessly
establish]{.underline} [a]{.underline} connection to [proxy]{.underline}
systems [to commit crimes at other places]{.underline}. \*They could
conceal the fact \*they are a cyborg so that [nobody would suspect
\*them]{.underline} of being involved in crimes.

**[AI Risk Deniers]{.underline}**: For the case of MC, it would be
appropriate to instead address "Cyborgization Risk Deniers". This
[stakeholder]{.underline} could [let people believe that cyborgization
is]{.underline} not more than a [Science Fiction]{.underline} scenario
[and leave non-enhanced humans in ignorance yielding]{.underline} an
even greater [disparity between cyborgs and the regular
humans]{.underline}.

**[AI Safety Researchers]{.underline}**: For the MAI scenario, the
authors state "AI Safety Researchers, if unethical, [might attempt to
justify funding and]{.underline} secure [jobs by **purposefully
developing problematic AI**]{.underline}." If in the future a discipline
like "[Cyborg Safety]{.underline}" existed, malicious people working in
this field [could]{.underline} deliberately [develop unsafe cyborg
systems]{.underline} e.g. such [that than can easily be
exploited]{.underline}, [so]{.underline} that [they can ensure their
occupation]{.underline} over and over again.

#### Unregulated BCIs cause global upheaval -- hierarchies cause conflict, the concept of humanity is destroyed, and a genocide of people who can't afford enhancement

After having pointed out the similarities between the entities which
could be interested in the usage of MAI on the one hand and MC on the
other hand, as well as having clarified the conformity of the achievable
unethical objectives in both scenarios, we will now allude to some
additional [societal impacts that can be]{.underline} [specifically
caused by MC]{.underline} (and not necessarily by MAI) through the
phenomenon of the human mind transcending its biological boundaries:

**[New hierarchy]{.underline}** in \*humankind: [Cyborgization could
lead to a **hierarchy of enhancement**]{.underline} forming an
open-ended continuum ranging from completely non-enhanced humans to
cyborg versions 1.0, 2.0 and so forth, even if performed with positive
or neutral intentions toward humans. This development follows from the
common practice of software updates and hardware tuning. Over time, the
biological part of the cyborgs is furthermore going to be surpassed by
the non-biological part getting faster with exponential pace. Like in
many other cases, the quality of the "[products]{.underline}" [people
can afford would depend on their financial status]{.underline} and a lot
of [people might irreversibly stay behind]{.underline}. This
[circumstances]{.underline} could [lead to **social unrest and
conflicts**]{.underline}. This background provides a strategical basis
for every conceivable kind of MC.

**[Global identity crisis]{.underline}**: [Cyborgization could initiate
a]{.underline}n unforeseen [social transformation shaking the notion
of]{.underline} "[human being", "identity" and "self]{.underline}" for
the questions could be: "At what time does someone stop to be a human?",
"Does the self include the machine part?", "What happens if the
non-biological part starts to prevail -- does the cyborg become a
machine?". Psychological studies actually demonstrated, that [human
self-perception is extremely flexible]{.underline} (Clark 2004).
Likewise, [the first]{.underline} officially recognized
[cyborg]{.underline} (the expression cyborg is here used in a broader
sense) Neil Harbisson, which is equipped with an eyeborg
[stated]{.underline} (Jeffries 2014): "I don't feel like I'm using
technology, or wearing technology. [I feel like **I am
technology**]{.underline}. I don't think of [my antenna]{.underline} as
a device - [it's a body part]{.underline}." The additional perception
through [the eyeborg fully integrated the functionality of his brain
leading to a **seamless unity**]{.underline}. This gives an indication
that [future cyborgs might extend the limits of "identity" and
"self"]{.underline} in addition to the higher level of intelligence.
[This could lead to]{.underline} a strong sense of [alienation between
non-enhanced humans and cyborgs **raising tensions**]{.underline} [and
providing a fertile ground for **MC**.]{.underline}

**[Evolutionary upheaval]{.underline}**: A world of work with [extremely
productive and superintelligent cyborgs]{.underline} could piece by
piece [make less enhanced humans superfluous]{.underline}. [MC
could]{.underline} at a certain point [introduce the **extinction** of
those people leading to a disaster for humanity]{.underline}. Equally,
cyborgization could lead to an evolutionary advantage and some could
consider it as the next step in evolution. In this case [cyborgs would
supersede non-enhanced humans]{.underline} in the long run and this
process might be accelerated by means of MC. The historian Yuval Noah
Harari claimed: "I think it is likely in the next 200 years or so [homo
sapiens will upgrade themselves]{.underline} into some idea of a divine
being, either through biological manipulation or genetic engineering of
by the creation of cyborgs, part organic part non-organic. \[..\] It
will be the greatest evolution in biology since the appearance of life.
Nothing really has changed in four billion years biologically speaking.
But [we will be as different from today's humans as chimps are now from
us]{.underline}" (Knapton 2015). But he also addressed [the increasing
**gap between poor and rich** in this future]{.underline}, [which could
lead to a **dying out of the poor**, while the **rich could live
forever**.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- BCI Impact Ext -- Adversarial Use

#### [China will use BCIs for brain control, violating basic human privacy and dignity.]{.underline} 

[Corr 21]{.underline} (Anders Corr, \"The Ethical Risks of China\'s
\'Brain Control\' Tech\", theepochtimes,
https://www.theepochtimes.com/the-ethical-risks-of-chinas-brain-control-tech_4167051.html,

[The Ethical Risks of 'Brain Control' Technologies The combination of
the Chinese military's research into "brain control" and the regime's
genocidal "brainwashing" should be taken more seriously by ethicists and
government officials in the United States, Europe, and among Asian
allies. According to bioethicists Marcello Ienca (University of Basel in
Switzerland) and Pim Haselager (Radboud University Nijmegen in the
Netherlands), brain-control interfaces can be used to "hack the brain"
in a way that violates the individual's privacy and agency.]{.underline}
[Ienca is currently at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne.
BCIs provide a brain-machine interface, either through direct
implantation of electrodes in brain tissue, or through more temporary
wearable technology that keeps the electrodes outside the intact skull,
according to the Ienca-Haselager paper, which is peer-reviewed and
appeared in the April 2016 issue of Ethics and Information Technology.
BCI is designed to assist patients who suffer from neurological diseases
that impair sensory-motor functions. BCIs can help them, for example,
communicate to a robotic arm that provides the patient with increased
control of their environment. BCIs are also being researched by the U.S.
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for military
applications, such as more rapid and efficient human operational control
over a fighter drone. But Ienca and Haselager cautioned in the paper,
"Hacking the brain: brain--computer interfacing technology and the
ethics of neurosecurity," that the ethical risks of BCI technologies are
underexplored relative to their rapid development. "Neurocrime" and
"brain-hacking," the researchers argued, including "illicit access to
and manipulation of neural information and computation," are a major
risk to the individual's "neurosecurity" such as individual privacy and
agency. **At risk are the most basic qualities of individuality**,
including consciousness, volition, perception, thinking,
self-identification, judgment, language, and memory. Ienca and Haselager
argued that "misusing neural devices for cybercriminal purposes may not
only threaten the physical security of the users but also influence
their behavior and alter their self-identification as persons." Ienca
and Haselager identified not only BCIs as "particularly critical" given
the potentiality of neurocrime and the function of BCIs for "reading of
brain activity," but also devices known as "neural stimulators." This
latter category of machine-brain interface includes devices for "deep
brain stimulation (DBS) and transcranial direct-current stimulators
(tDCS)." Ienca and Haselager rightly highlighted the risks of brain
readers and stimulators, and argued that "ethical safeguards against
these risks should be considered early in design and regulation."
Ethical safeguards, regulation, and emerging international law will be
particularly the case as Beijing disregards ethical standards in its
attempt to increase its control of the individual within the expanding
boundaries of what the CCP considers to be "Greater China."]{.underline}

#### **Authoritarian regimes have immense incentive to misuse BCIs.**

[Dissent from within is one of the major vulnerabilities of totalitarian
dictatorships. BCIs offer dictators a powerful tool to counteract this
weakness. Increases in abilities for surveillance would make it easier
to identify and root out dissent or root out skeptics who might betray
the party, and thus would make it easier to maintain totalitarian
control. While conventional surveillance may allow for a high level of
monitoring, such as tracking of citizens' behaviour and actions, it
provides no way for a dictator to peer inside the minds of their
subjects. Because of this, the difficulty of identifying the attitudes
of careful defectors remains high. BCIs constitute an unprecedented
threat here. Surveillance through already existing methods may fail to
expose some threats to a totalitarian regime, such as party members who
carefully hide their skepticism. But BCI based surveillance would have
no such flaw. The level of intrusion here is potentially quite
**severe**. With the advancement of BCIs, it is highly likely that in
the near future we will see a rapid expansion in the ability to observe
the contents of another's mind. Some researchers claim that advanced
BCIs will have access to more information about the intentions,
attitudes, and desires of a subject than those very subjects do
themselves, suggesting that even subconscious attitudes and recognition,
as well as intentional deception and hidden intentions will be
detectable by BCIs (Bunce et al, 2005; Evers and Sigman, 2013). Already,
BCIs are able to detect unconscious recognition of objects that a
subject has seen but cannot consciously remember seeing (Bellman et al,
2018). Others have even suggested that by more precisely recording the
activity of a larger number of neurons, future BCIs will be able to
reveal not just perceptions and words, but emotions, thoughts,
attitudes, intentions, and abstract ideas like recognition of people or
concepts (Roelfsema et al., 2018). Attitudes towards ideas, people, or
organisations could be discovered by correlating emotions to their
associated thought content, and dictatorships could use this to discover
attitudes towards the state, political figures, or even ideas. This
would allow detection of dissent without fail and allow a dictator to
quell rebellion before a rebellious thought is even shared. Some might
hope for BCIs that do not have this level of access, but accessing and
recording mental states is a fundamental and unavoidable feature of many
BCIs.]{.underline} In order to achieve their desired functions, many
BCIs need a clear way to read neural data. [Without significant neural
data they simply cannot function -- it is impossible to translate neural
data to exert some function if one does not have access to that neural
data. Brain stimulators and BCIs are specifically designed to allow this
kind of access; it is crucial for the effective functioning of the
device (Ienca, 2015). It is of course possible that BCIs made by some
companies will be exclusively targeted to certain sections of the brain,
for example, only targeting areas associated with speech, and not
targeting other areas associated with emotions or thought. This is
conceivable, though it is not clear that all companies and countries
would do the same. Furthermore, the utility gained by expanding to other
areas of the brain beyond the speech centre means it is highly doubtful
the technology will remain restrained indefinitely. It is likely that
BCIs will be created by companies, which have strong financial incentive
to record the neural states of users, if only to gain more information
with which to improve their own technology. This information could be
**requisitioned by governments**, as is frequently done to tech
companies at present -- even in democratic countries. Further
exacerbating this problem, privacy laws have a history of struggling to
keep pace with technological advancements. In more authoritarian
countries, neural data might be transmitted directly to state records,
and the preservation of privacy may not be attempted at all. In essence,
BCIs allow an easy and accurate way to detect thoughtcrime. For the
first time, it will be possible for states to surveil the minds of its
citizens. Deep surveillance of this kind would increase the likelihood
that totalitarian dictatorships would last
**indefinitely**.]{.underline}

Direct effect weapons [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[military is currently developing "a set of design and synthesis
processes that will enable the specification of a desired function, and
be able to rapidly synthesize a protein that performs the
function]{.underline}." Rather than modifying existing proteins, [this
biotechnology would allow the **creation** of **new proteins** based on
**specific performance objectives**]{.underline} (DARPA, "Protein Design
Processes" 1998). The field of genetic protein decoding and engineering
of this kind is known as proteomics (Committee 2001, p. 15).
Understanding the functions of proteins is key to opening entirely new
frontiers in medicine -- and warfare. Already, researchers have
destroyed targeted cancer cells by using engineered nanoparticles to
deliver genes only to the tumor and not to healthy neighboring tissue.
Once the genes were inserted, they stimulated the production of a
protein that selectively destroys the cancer (BBC News 2009). However,
[proteomics also opens a different avenue of potential development in
biotech]{.underline}nological [attacks in shifting away from infectious
agents to **targeting human bioregulators**]{.underline}, natural
substances in the body that control automatic processes such as blood
pressure and immune responses. Alibek (1999) claimed that the Soviet
Union pursued this research into "direct effect weapons" in the 1980s to
circumvent the BWC. [The result would]{.underline} not actually be an
illness, but the [turn]{.underline}ing of **[the body against itself
through disruption]{.underline}**, and projects along these lines have
at least been considered (Huang and Kosal 2008, p. 9, Preston 2009, pp.
313--314). Interfering with some of the body's neurotransmitters, for
example, could cause memory loss, panic disorder, or depression (Dando,
in Pearson et al. 2007, pp. 133--134). [NATO has listed "chemical
technologies that could act on the central nervous system" as
"technologies of interest"]{.underline} (Pearson, in Pearson et al.
2007, p. 89). Defence Studies 333 Chinese researchers Guo and Yang
(2005) directly addressed the security applications of such efforts in
proteomics, arguing: [Direct-effect weapons]{.underline} ... [can cause
**destruction** that is both **more powerful** and more civilized
**than** that caused by conventional killing methods like gunpowder or
**nuclear weapons**]{.underline} ... A military attack, therefore, might
wound an enemy's genes, proteins, cells, tissues, and organs, causing
more damage than conventional weapons could. However, such devastating,
nonlethal effects will require us to pacify the enemy through postwar
reconstruction efforts and hatred control ... \[W\]e could create a
microbullet out of a 1 micron tungsten or gold ion, on whose surface
plasmid DNA or naked DNA could be precipitated, and deliver the bullet
via a gunpowder explosion, electron transmission, or high-pressured gas
to penetrate the body surface. We could then release DNA molecules to
integrate with the host's cells through blood circulation and cause
disease or injury by controlling genes. Around the same time, an
American biodefense expert added that: [If one can disrupt unit loyalty
through fear or another emotion, the **army would cease to exist as a
fighting force**. Claustrophobia would make soldiers tear off their
protective face mask. Fear, thirst, accelerated heart rate,
hypermotility of the gut -- these would be the desired peptide effects.
**Delivery would be accomplished using engineered
pathogens**]{.underline}, and their primary **[role in biowarfare would
be as delivery systems for direct effect weapons rather than the
transmission of infectious disease]{.underline}** (Moreno 2006, pp.
178--179).

The Impact of New Technologies, CBW Magazine,

In June 2018, German police arrested a Tunisian man in Cologne for
trying to build a biological weapon using the deadly toxin, ricin.1 In
October 2018, researchers flagged a US agricultural program funded by
DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) as a potential mask
for a bioweapons project.2 At the same time, Russia also claimed that
the US had tested biological weapons in Georgia killing over 70 people.3
Further, suspect packages were sent to select targets in the United
States in October 2018;4 these packages in addition to being mail bombs
also carried a white powder reprising concerns of the anthrax attacks
from 2001 which led to the death of 5 people. There has been no incident
of biological agents being used as a weapon of mass destruction in the
recent past. Yet as the above examples show, [there have been attempts
to explore and create technologies that could be **weaponised** by both
state and non-state actors. The threat was made apparent by James
Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, who added gene editing in
their annual worldwide threat assessment report in 2016]{.underline}.5
Since then, [there has been a wider recognition that the advances in
technologies and improved access to science have lowered the barriers to
creating designer bioweapons**. Gene editing** using]{.underline} the
recently discovered [CRISPR/Cas system allows precise editing at a
relatively cheaper rate without any high-cost expert training. It is
important to note that before gene editing if any bioterrorist wanted to
use a pathogen, he/she would have to obtain the pathogen from a
restricted source. In many cases of bioweapons use,]{.underline} such as
the one in Oregon where followers of Osho Rajneeshee, intentionally
poisoned civilians using Salmonella, these [pathogens are obtained from
scientific laboratories which hold these microbes for research
purposes.]{.underline} 7 Over the past many decades, the instillation of
Good Lab Practices and Biosafety standards have prevented the accidental
release of these agents for malicious purposes. [However, with the
advances in gene editing techniques, **bioterrorists** could now use a
relatively harmless biological agent and convert it into a more harmful
agent. For instance, the currently available vaccines that protect
against measles render the pathogen ineffective in causing the disease.
However, the measles pathogen can be genetically edited such that it is
no longer resistant to the vaccine. The resulting pathogen could easily
wreak havoc even among a vaccinated population.]{.underline} Other
[synthetic biology techniques]{.underline} could also be used to [create
pathogens without the necessity of getting any organic
backbone]{.underline}. In 2002, scientists claimed the creation of the
entire polio virus from scratch and the genome sequence was put in the
public domain. 8 While such an endeavour needs scientific expertise and
infrastructure, the public revelation of the methodology and genetic
sequence certainly lowers the barriers to anyone attempting to design a
similar agent. Another development has been the availability of large
data sets of scientific knowledge and the AI (Artificial
Intelligence)-driven processing powers that can help identify
combinations of genes to specifically tailor a bioweapon against a
target. Furthermore, as the scientific community shifts towards a more
open access policy to make science freely available, the same knowledge
could be easily available as well as accessible by terrorists. [There
are 3 fundamental ways in which these technologies - either alone or in
combination -could change the face of **biowarfare**]{.underline}:
[Creation of bioweapons that do not impact self forces]{.underline}:
This is exemplified by the vaccine-resistant measles case mentioned
earlier. New diseases that one's own forces are protected against can be
designed for warfare. [Creation of agricultural pests]{.underline}:
Similar methodologies can be used to engineer bio-agents against
agricultural targets, crippling the economy of the enemy nation or
starving their population. [Creation of tailored weapons]{.underline}:
Using advanced genetic knowledge, bioweapons capable of targeting single
individuals or ethnic groups may be created. [The use of a **bioweapon**
of this variety may go unnoticed as an intentional attack and state
parties may prefer such a weapon to **avert large-scale conflict with an
enemy state**]{.underline}. The renewed attention towards biological
weapons and the relative ease to procure and stock them as compared with
traditional weapons of mass destruction may also entice non-state actors
into acquiring and using bioweapons. In the context of this changing
scenario of bioweapons use, [existing regulations]{.underline} helmed by
the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) [are severely inadequate in
restraining the proliferation of these new technologies]{.underline}.
Current Status of Biological Weapons Convention [The BWC]{.underline},
[which have been in effect since 1975 has been repeatedly criticised for
its ambiguous language and more importantly, for the lack of a
verification mechanism that can be invoked to check if signatory nations
are complying with its mandate]{.underline}. The Convention prevents the
creation, use, stockpiling or exchange of any bioweapon; however, [its
very definition of "bioweapon" is ambiguous]{.underline}. It allows the
stocking of pathogenic agents in small quantities that can be used for
peaceful purposes. Scientists, for example, hold small repositories of
pathogenic agents to research better diagnostic or therapeutic
interventions. However, unlike nuclear or chemical weapons, [small
repositories of biological agents can be easily scaled up for malicious
purposes]{.underline}. [This makes identifying the intention behind
holding biological agents in any quantity difficult]{.underline} and
defeats the purpose of the Convention. [The BWC's repeated attempts to
introduce an effective verification mechanism have failed and as many as
12 countries including Iraq, Iran, Libya, China, Russia, and North
Korea, who are parties to the Convention, are often alleged to have an
ongoing bioweapons programme.9 An incident in Russia revealed that they
held on to their exploration bioweapons programme much after ratifying
their commitment to the BWC.10 Notabl]{.underline}y, Israel is not a
signatory to the Convention stoking fears that the nation may be
experimenting with bioweapons.11 [The]{.underline} 2018 BWC [Meeting of
Experts held in Geneva in August also noted the implications of gene
editing advances to the areas of biowarfare and the need for its
regulation]{.underline}. 12 China and Pakistan proposed a voluntary
model code of conduct for scientists engaged in using biotechnology.
France and India proposed the formation of a database where aid
requirements could be matched with specific offers of assistance. But
more pertinently, the December BWC review conference brought to notice
the dismal funding situation of the BWC but did not reach a consensus on
adopting any of the measures suggested by the Experts meeting. 13 Yet
there has not been a significant incident post World War II where
bioweapons have been used as a weapon of mass destruction. [This success
may not be a fall out of the BWC but could be attributed to the nature
of bioweapons: they **are difficult to control**, **unreliable** and
cannot distinguish between self and non-self forces. Further, there was
fear of usurpation of the technology by non-state actors. However, with
the advent of new technologies discussed earlier, many of these
limitations have now been removed. As a consequence, the threat of a
bioweapons attack has become **very real**]{.underline} and India needs
to take steps to protect itself from such an attack. Policy
recommendations for India14 India's weak primary healthcare system (as
stated in a report where the country ranks 145 among 195 countries in
healthcare access),15 conducive environment16 and hostile relations with
neighbouring countries leave India vulnerable to a biological attack.
Such an attack might aim at decreasing productivity in India by
affecting its people or hampering agriculture or other natural resources
such as water. India needs to develop a strong biodefense programme to
shield itself against any bio- attack. [A primary focus has to be on
creating grassroot-level infrastructure and linkages to implement
real-time surveillance mechanisms that can rapidly detect a biological
outbreak and trigger a swift response from the appropriate
authorities]{.underline}. This holds true for both human and
agricultural attacks. Improved point-of-care diagnostics will aid in
real-time surveillance. A staggered chain of protocols, including
quarantine, personal protection equipment for healthcare workers, sample
collection and delivery should occur in response to an infectious
outbreak -- particularly for those cases where a disease cannot be
easily identified. In many cases, an antibody or specific DNA based
tests are used for diagnosis. However, the sequencing of the entire DNA
would help identify if the agent has been tampered with using artificial
agents. Though this is not always reliable, treating unusual cases as a
likely bioweapons attack and documenting genome sequences of the
biological agent would provide a repository that could lend useful
information for future use. [The adoption of biosafety standards in all
academic and private laboratories and its enforcement through the
instillation of penalties for violations **will reduce** accidental
leakages of **biological agents** from authorised
laboratories]{.underline}. The inclusion of ethics in school and college
level curriculum, as well as orientation of new hires in laboratories,
is essential to educate about the responsibility of the individual
researcher with respect to the biological material they are using.
Leader at the Biological Weapons Convention India needs to take a
leadership position at the BWC and facilitate the inclusion of the
following: A scientific advisory board: Unlike the Chemical Weapons
Convention[, the BWC does not have a scientific advisory board to advise
on new trends in biotechnology and ways to counter the new age
bioweapons]{.underline}. The formation of such a board would aid the
Convention to make pragmatic decisions to prevent the proliferation of
bioweapons. Funding issues[: **Lack of funding** and infrastructure has
long ailed the BWC]{.underline}. The implementation support unit of BWC
consists of 3 individuals and is sorely under-staffed. 17 India could
work with other countries in ensuring the BWC has enough funds to carry
out its designated roles. An alternative to the verification mechanism:
While verification is deemed a political non-starter at the BWC, India
could partner with other countries for creating a more co-operative
mechanism that could be used to transfer important technology for
vaccine production or improved vaccine manufacture. India could also
push for transforming the voluntary system for reporting on national
activities to a mandatory reporting. [The current voluntary
confidence-building measures require member parties to voluntarily
exchange information on vaccine production plants, biodefence programs,
and unusual disease outbreaks. However, this system has seen low active
participation;]{.underline} from 1987 to 1995, only 70 of the then 139
member states of the BWC submitted data declarations, and only 11 took
part in all rounds of the information exchange.18 In addition to
mandatory reporting, penalties can be put in for parties who are not
compliant with the confidence building measures dictated by the BWC.
This will help India to gain access to technologies that could improve
India's primary health care response. Treaties with Other Nations Within
and outside the BWC, India needs to forge strategic partnerships with
countries who can share their expertise on biosecurity. India needs to
embark on a public engagement dialogue to educate its population about
the threat of infectious outbreaks and how to respond in case of any
outbreak. [An unusual outbreak can easily cause panic amongst people and
may aid in spreading the disease as people move away from the epicentre
of the attack. The **threat of a bioweapons attack is swiftly being
recognised by countries worldwide**]{.underline} and India also needs to
step up its biodefense programmes[. While new technologies may lower
barriers of acquiring biological weapons, the renewed attention the
topic is getting may itself be sufficient to get non-state actors
interested in experimenting with such weapons.]{.underline} Improved
access to scientific knowledge, easier control over biological material
and reduced cost of creating designer pathogens could entice state and
non-state actors to experiment with biological weapons[. The current
regulatory architecture led by the Biological Weapons Convention may be
inadequate to contain this threat]{.underline} and needs to be
revisited. India, in particular, [**needs to focus on** national and
**international measures that can be taken to curtail the threat of
bioweapons**]{.underline}. A networked primary healthcare system, strong
collaboration with other countries and public engagement are central to
protecting India from an infectious outbreak -- may it be intentional or
natural.

[**Biological weapons are considered the most dangerous** of all known
**weapons of mass destruction**. They are used to deliberately cause
epidemics among humans; destroy the environmental components, including
water, air, and soil; and target crops and livestock.]{.underline}
Examples of diseases used in biological warfare include anthrax,
smallpox, plague, cholera, and avian flu. [In addition to the
catastrophic effects of biological warfare on the biodiversity and the
environment]{.underline}, [their danger lies in their low cost and
**rapid spread**, as well as their easy preparation, transport, and
use.]{.underline} Unlike nuclear and chemical bombs[, biological bombs
are without odor or color and therefore cannot be detected.
Additionally, **bioweapons are dangerous because of their effects on
untargeted organisms** in a military attack, and the clinical symptoms
they create may be difficult to distinguish from normal
diseases.]{.underline} [Bioweapon pathogens remain in nature for several
years and are able to survive in harsh environmental conditions.
Bioweapons spread germs that contaminate air, food, water, and the
environment, causing epidemiological diseases for different living
organisms.]{.underline} Air: [A wide variety of germs can contaminate
air and are used in biological warfare]{.underline}. Fungi are the most
common, and they travel by air over long distances to infect healthy
plants. Food: [Food contamination is also one of the most powerful
methods used to carry out biological warfare attacks. Disease is
transmitted either directly to humans through contaminated food or drink
or indirectly by hosts.]{.underline} Water: [Water can spread a number
of lethal infectious agents as well. For example, one gram of
Clostridium tetani poison is able to **kill eight million people within
six hours**]{.underline}. Diseases are one of the main drivers of
extinction in endangered species; therefore, disease control is
fundamental to preserve biodiversity. [Despite the presence of vaccines
and drugs for most bioweapons, they may not be available in adequate
quantities to cope with an epidemiological disease outbreak. Biological
attacks pose a threat to naturally rare wild plants and animals and to
species whose natural habitats have been degraded by human activities.
Furthermore, diseases that humans, domestic animals, and domestic plants
have been able to develop immunity to can be fatal in wild animals and
plants. **Bioweapons** are not only having **direct effects** on the
genetic biodiversity of indigenous species but also are having direct
and indirect catastrophic effects on vital plant and animal
communities]{.underline}. Conservation of livestock breeds is essential
to maintaining genetic diversity, which in turn is vital to increasing
the ability of living organisms to adapt to environmental changes. The
danger of bioweapons regarding animal biodiversity is summarized in
three main points: 1. The direct impact of diseases on wild species Some
d[eadly diseases in humans or domestic animals can infect wild
animals.]{.underline} For instance, an epidemic destructive impact on
endangered species is reflected in the effects of Canine distemper, a
natural viral disease that infects wild dogs and wild animals belonging
to the same group. Canine distemper was also developed in bioweapon
laboratories. Over the past decade[, the spread of this disease has
resulted in habitat loss and in the extinction of a large number of wild
species in North America]{.underline}. Additionally, it led to the
elimination of about one-third of the lion population in Tanzania and
had serious impacts on the endangered leopard population. 2. Invasive
species The history of rinderpest in Africa provides a model for
predicting the potential effects of lethal diseases on wild species and
livestock. In 1887, European colonial armies introduced the rinderpest
virus to Africa through imported cattle, which led to a rinderpest
outbreak among domestic cattle breeds and wild species, killing an
estimated 90--95% of African cattle and buffaloes within three years. To
control the epidemic, African herds and buffaloes have been destroyed in
most parts of Africa. Despite efforts to combat rinderpest over the past
century, the disease is still strong, and its outbreak in the region
occurs frequently. 3. Elimination of animal species, hosts, and vectors
Threatened species may be destroyed in areas that have been subjected to
biological attacks with the aim of eradicating the disease. For example,
in the United States, programs to control brucellosis in livestock have
resulted in killing large numbers of wild animals, including the Bison
and the white tailed deer. Microbes can be used in crop destruction. For
instance, "Rice blast" is a disease affecting rice and therefore leads
to crop destruction and genetic changes in the plant. [The discussion
about controlling destructive **bioweapons** is growing, as they **pose
a vast danger to both humanity and the environment** alike. Any failure
to prevent biological attacks can lead to the deterioration of genetic
diversity in animals and plants, the extinction of endangered species,
and the destruction of human livelihoods and traditional
cultures]{.underline}. Biotechnology has increased the economical value
of genetic diversity of living organisms; hence, it has increased the
risk of eliminating genetic diversity through the use of GMO bioweapons.
[Most of all, the environment will be the silent victim of this
war]{.underline}. It is not easy to put an end to the biological arms
race, so [global efforts must be consolidated to combat these threats.
Countries must strengthen their ability to detect early
attacks.]{.underline} Biologists and economists need to communicate with
decision makers to convince them of the importance of developing defense
systems to face bioweapons and limit their environmental and
socioeconomical effects. Certainly[, it is **necessary** to raise
awareness regarding the dangers of biological warfare.]{.underline}
[Interdisciplinary and international efforts are required to increase
the surveillance, monitoring, and identification of pathogens and to
better understand the dynamics of disease transmission within human,
plant, and animal populations. This will greatly enhance our ability to
combat the effects of bioweapons and emerging diseases on
biodiversit]{.underline}y.

In 1990, the U.S. political and military leadership was significantly
challenged by the possibility that Iraq, having the fourth largest
offensive chemical and biological weapons program in the world at the
time, might use those unconventional weapons against U.S. forces and its
allies massing in Saudi Arabia. For all practical purposes, there was no
real capability to rapidly detect and identify the deliberate release of
anthrax spores or other biological weapons, and the U.S. military did
not have sufficient vaccines or therapeutics for such an event. Due to
this severe neglect to biological defense, former Secretary of State
James Baker gave a formal letter to the Iraqi foreign minister stating
that Iraq would "pay a terrible price" if it used chemical or biological
weapons against the U.S.-led coalition.1 Had Saddam Hussein decided to
use biological weapons, it could have caused thousands of casualties.
Fortunately for U.S. forces, he did not have a significant biological
weapons capability and there was no use of those weapons. Despite dark
predictions of both nation-states and violent extremist organizations
planning biological attacks against the nation, there has been no test
of the U.S. military's biodefense capability. A "biological taboo"
resulting from decades of arms control discussions has held, despite the
lack of a verification regime behind the Biological Weapons Convention
(BWC).2 Concerns about Iraq's biological weapons capability in 2003
evaporated a year later, with nothing substantive to find. Despite
concerns about a domestic terrorist biological incident following the
anthrax attacks in 2001, there has never been a mass casualty attack
caused by biological organisms in the United States since then. [The
Nation's recent public health challenges in addressing the 2019
coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) have caused questions as to whether the
U.S. military is sufficiently prepared for an **adversary that might be
emboldened to use biological weapons against U.S. national security
interests**.]{.underline} Despite the lack of any biological attacks or
even threat of attacks over the past twenty years, [the potential impact
of a large-scale use of a contagious disease concerns enough people to
call for new national strategies and improved response capabilities for
biological threats.]{.underline} Current strategies aim to mitigate
natural disease, to regulate biological research associated with the
more hazardous biological diseases, and to improve the U.S. public
health system to better respond to biological threats.3 Yet despite the
development of four national strategies for national biodefense over the
past twenty years, the U.S. government has not significantly advanced
its capabilities for protecting against and responding to biological
threats, defined as including natural diseases, deliberate biological
releases, and laboratory accidents[. Despite the high-level attention to
this threat, assessments of the Nation's capability to prepare for
deliberate biological threats have **not, however, been
positive**.]{.underline} [Unclassified assessments from the State
Department and the Department of Defense (DOD) suggest **that China and
Russia** could have a **biological weapons** capability, as could North
Korea and Iran.]{.underline}4 The lack of any actual use of biological
weapons against the United States has perhaps diminished the concern
that potential weaknesses exist. [In the event of a future conflict with
great powers, there is the chance that biological warfare could emerge
as a significant threat, perhaps in a form unrecognized from Cold War
experiences.]{.underline} Prior to attempting the implementation of yet
another strategy to counter biological threats[, the Army needs to
establish the context of how adversaries would deliberately use
biological threats against U.S. national security interests. Once a
rational appreciation of the threat is developed, one can then create a
defense strategy that directly addresses deliberate biological releases.
Importantly, such a strategy needs to be resourced and implemented to
address the future challenges of a deliberate biological release,
understanding that natural infectious diseases pose a competing
priority.]{.underline} Counter to the hypothesis that the pandemic
outbreak has revealed potential vulnerabilities to biological weapons,
COVID-19 has not in fact acted like a biological weapon. As a result,
the lessons that apply from this contemporary crisis toward a biological
weapons attack are few. A pandemic outbreak, affecting the general
population over a year's time, requires a different approach than
military forces protecting themselves from a focused deliberate
biological attack. COVID-19 is not lethal enough and does not
incapacitate people quickly enough to qualify as a potential weapon,
despite the more than 750,000 deaths caused over twenty-four months
across the United States.5 A biological disease that does not
significantly impact young, healthy people and that is easily countered
by a national vaccine program is not prime material for a weapon system.
COVID-19 may have slowed down economic activities, but it is not an
existential threat to the U.S. government. Despite the potential impact
on national security, pandemic diseases are best addressed separately
from biological defense concepts. The U.S. military does anticipate the
potential use of biological weapons in combat operations. In that light,
the Department of Defense has a counter-weapons of mass destruction
(WMD) strategy and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear
(CBRN) defense concept to guide its efforts to prevent, protect against,
and respond to adversaries using biological weapons.6 The ratification
of the BWC has significantly reduced the number of potential adversaries
that might use traditional biological warfare (BW) agents, allowing one
to focus on particular actors and military scenarios. The traditional
biological warfare agents such as anthrax, pneumatic plague, smallpox,
and tularemia are still potent candidates for future warfare. However,
[the employment of said weapons may look very different than envisioned
during the Cold War.]{.underline} North Korea may be the exception to
this statement, as it is unclear how that nation would use
unconventional weapons, but its operational concept for warfare appears
to be based in an industrial age, massed firepower approach, similar to
what NATO might have anticipated in the 1970s.[7 China and Iran are
assessed as not complying with the BWC, and **Russia and North Korea are
believed to have retained offensive biological weapons programs**.8
While we can understand the biological warfare model that North Korea
might employ, this does not necessarily apply to Russia's and China's
concepts of employment for biological weapons.]{.underline} The Cold War
model of using massive amounts of biological agents against troop
concentrations, major population centers, and large military sites such
as air bases and seaports requires large-scale production, storage, and
testing capability. As Russia and China have modernized their nuclear
and conventional forces, they have also changed their approach toward
military confrontations with the United States and partner nations.
While preparing for the possibility of total war, both countries have
focused on conducting regional operations against U.S. allies using
methods that fall below the threshold of open conflict.9 Their nuclear
arsenals cast a coercive shadow over regional operations that allow
those nations to aggressively push and attain their political
objectives. [As a result, a clandestine biological weapons program can
offer them a capability to perform single, small-scale chemical or
biological weapons attacks on focused targets (facilities or
individuals) while claiming to be compliant with the BWC]{.underline}.10
The former Soviet Union had a massive biological warfare program,
unmatched by any historical measure. Despite extensive documentation of
this program, the Russian Federation has not fully acknowledged the
former Soviet Union BW program. [The State Department has gone so far as
to designate specific Russian government facilities as "acting contrary
to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United
States" through their association as military defense facilities
associated with a BW research program.11 These are not recent concerns.
Analysts will point out that]{.underline} in 2012, then Prime Minister
[Vladimir Putin talked about creating "weapon systems that use different
physical principles ... (beam, geophysical, wave, genetic,
psychophysical and other types of weapons)."]{.underline}12 However, it
is unclear that this attributed quote referred to a return to developing
biological weapons to support military conflict[. In 2019, Putin
directed a budget of 220 billion rubles (or \$3.3 billion) toward the
development of genetic technologies that could support a wide range of
applications (biomedical, agricultural, or biodefense).13 At the same
time, the Russian government has claimed that the United States is
building offensive BW laboratories in countries surrounding Russia
through the Biological Threat Reduction Program.]{.underline} For
instance, the "Lugar Center for Public Health Research" in Tbilisi,
Georgia, was funded by U.S. defense funds, but its intent is to promote
health security against natural infectious disease outbreaks.14 In
response to U.S. government accusations of China's role in the COVID-19
outbreak, Chinese government officials have recently echoed the same
claims that the U.S. government has created biological weapons near
their borders.15 This type of disinformation campaign falls squarely in
the "gray zone" set of tools[. Both China and Russia **have ignored**
international efforts to prevent the proliferation of unconventional
weapons technology and materials]{.underline}. China's position as one
of the leaders of the global bioeconomy increases its potential for
realized or latent advanced biological warfare capabilities. Beijing
appears committed to becoming a leader in biotechnology, which holds the
promise of myriad public health applications. Yet, many biotechnology
applications are dual-use, capable of delivering both public health
benefits and advances in biological warfare capabilities. As one top
U.S. expert noted, China "is pursuing a very aggressive strategy to
become the world leader in biotechnology."16 Sustained public and
private investment in synthetic biology technologies needed for DNA
sequencing and synthesis as well as gene editing have enabled China to
develop a wide array of dual-use biotechnologies in the field of
synthetic biology. Many experts anticipate that synthetic biology
advances will enable the development of "new and novel biomaterials" to
include advanced bioweapons.17 As a 2020 Brookings Institution study
noted, "[The determination of China's one-party state to become a
leading player in biotechnology is reflected by the rapid growth in
investment in the sector. Some estimates claim that collectively,
China's central, local, and provincial governments have invested over
\$100 billion in life sciences research and development."18 China's
sustained and sizeable government investment in domestic biotechnology
has created an industrial base capable of developing and manufacturing a
range of extant and novel biological warfare agents]{.underline}. And
[while the possibility of developing novel biological warfare agents is
present, it is more probable that China wants to use its biotechnology
lead to produce superior commercial pharmaceuticals and to enhance its
military forces. There is always speculation that advances in the life
sciences will drive an evolution in biological weapons, **making them
more lethal, more environmentally hardy, more targeted toward specific
populations**]{.underline}, or more able to confound contemporary
detection systems. This belief used to be rooted in the 1970s rise of
biotechnology, and then it was 1990s genetics driving the concerns.
Today, it is the promise (and dangers) of synthetic biology. And while
it is true that one could always improve characteristics of certain
biological weapons, there are significant drawbacks as to such an
approach.19 Assuming that an adversary might develop altered biological
weapons to be more operationally relevant, this would still be a
violation of treaty (if it were China or Russia) and international
norms. [Modifying a biological organism to enhance its resistance to
antibiotics might in turn reduce other desired characteristics, such as
its lethality or dissemination qualities. Any use of a genetically
modified organism would run the risk of direct attribution to a
particular source]{.underline}. Western military forces lack the
capability to detect the deliberate use of biological weapons until
after exposure. In addition, U.S. forces lack vaccines for a number of
traditional biological warfare agents, let alone engineered diseases.20
Any nation with an advanced industrial capability can easily develop
biological agents that can damage or destroy crops or livestock, in
addition to targeting humans. There is no need for an overly
sophisticated engineered biological warfare agent à la the latest James
Bond movie, No Time to Die. And even if military forces had tactical
biological detectors that could identify all biological warfare agents
in a timely enough fashion to put on protective masks, traditional
biological weapons would still be an effective strategic weapon against
a civilian populace, its livestock, or cropland. There is no possibility
that the United States and its Western allies can make biological
weapons obsolete.21 At the same time, we do not need to overexaggerate
the threat of biological weapons as some Hollywood scripts portray them.
There are several options that could be explored. The traditional
approach has been to develop chemical and biological defense as a
combined operational concept. Both chemical and biological warfare
agents use similar delivery systems and target the human body's
physiological response to hazards. Under the larger construct of
countering WMD threats, [the U.S. government can engage in arms control
negotiations to limit biological weapons use, use preemptive strikes to
target a nation's WMD capability, and respond to its use with protective
equipment that limits the impedance of combat operations. None of these
options are singular to biological threats.]{.underline} A second option
is to task the medical community to identify and respond to both
biological warfare attacks and natural disease outbreaks while limiting
reliance on biological detectors and technical experts. [The U.S. Air
Force, for instance, endorses a biological defense concept that is
separate from chemical defense and that relies on the medical community
for initial detection and identification.22 This is a very specific
focus on biological threats that includes a conscious decision to limit
investments in people and equipment in response to a lower probability
of deliberate biological attacks.]{.underline} The Air Force concept is
a subset of its counter WMD operations, as the Army's CBRN defense
efforts are. The U.S. Army recently released a biological defense
strategy that calls for the "synchronized implementation" of both
biological warfare defense and infectious natural diseases across the
Army.23 Interestingly, the office responsible for implementing this
strategy is the U.S. Army Nuclear and Countering Weapons of Mass
Destruction Agency, not the Army's chemical-biological defense
specialists and not the Army's medical experts who respectively own
those areas of expertise. It is not immediately clear as to whether this
strategy calls for the development of a stand-alone biological defense
concept that combines capabilities for both infectious natural diseases
and deliberate biological releases, or just a single agency that manages
two very different concepts (counter-WMD and force health protection)
that have a common scientific origin. The strategy details four "lines
of effort" that include developing and managing talent and facilities
that address biological threats; maintaining a biological common
operating picture and awareness of biological defense forensics;
building a readiness posture that includes protection, response, and
training for biological defense capabilities; and directing
modernization efforts for biological defense concepts and doctrine. Will
this new governance structure fundamentally change how the Army does
biological defense? Given policy and budget direction, probably not.
This is not the first time a military agency has suggested moving all
biodefense activities into a portfolio for medical countermeasures for
infectious diseases. There is an almost instinctual movement toward
putting medical experts in charge of developing capabilities for
countering all biological threats; however, that does not work for two
reasons. First, given a collection of biological threats---whether
natural, deliberate, or accidental---medical leaders will always
consider infectious natural diseases the most important concerns because
of the large numbers of service members and their dependents who get
sick from natural diseases. And there are a lot of infectious natural
diseases to address. In 1990, the U.S. military found itself without
adequate vaccines for anthrax and botulin toxin when it was preparing to
face an Iraqi military force that had an active chemical and biological
weapons program. This was due to a deliberate decision to deprioritize
research and development for biological warfare agents and focus instead
on countermeasures for natural diseases such as chikungunya virus and
diarrheal diseases. [Second, while the response to biological threats
has often had a common core, the prevention and protection against
biological threats certainly does not.]{.underline} While one can try to
deter adversaries from using biological weapons, Mother Nature cannot be
deterred. [Protecting military forces from biological weapons during
combat operations requires a completely different approach than
protecting a military base's population from natural diseases. This
requires a level of nuance to understand that a single biodefense
concept cannot protect fundamentally different populations with
different requirements and facing fundamentally different biological
threats.]{.underline} There is a reason why there are different budgets
and authorities for dealing with biological warfare agents, natural
biological diseases, and biological research laboratory accidents. The
primary purposes of any strategy document are to identify a specific
mission or program, to identify policy objectives that should drive
discrete programs, and to offer a plan to achieve those objectives. In
the military, this is called "ends, ways, and means." Ideally, a
strategy will also aid decision makers in moving resources toward those
goals that require funding to achieve those objectives. So, the problem
with a biological defense strategy that aims to address all biological
threats---whether at the Army, the DOD, or national level---is that
there are multiple agencies with budget elements who are already
directed to address specific biological threats. I will argue that at
least five biological threat sectors require consideration in any
biological defense strategy: disease prevention as a function of public
health, bioterrorism response as a function of homeland security,
military biodefense as a function as countering WMD, biosurety as a
function of laboratory practices, and biosecurity and biosafety as a
function of agricultural and food industries. None of these are new
security concerns. Each has a dedicated government agency that focuses
on a distinct threat using a congressionally approved budget. Because
each biological threat sector already has a lead agency and agenda to
pursue, the question comes as to what a centralized biological defense
strategy would change or impact the direction of federal government or
military biodefense programs. Public health efforts addressing
infectious biological diseases, to include aspects of disease prevention
in the military's force health protection program, have been around for
more than one hundred years. One of the challenges in the U.S. public
health program is that it is federalized, meaning that states and local
jurisdictions implement public health programs while the federal
government provides research and funding for specific purposes. The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National
Institutes of Health represent the largest government agencies in this
area, putting tens of billions of dollars against infectious disease
research, surveillance, and response. [Within the military, the Army's
Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases has a research and
development program for infectious diseases to address potential
biological threats to service members in U.S. and overseas
theaters.]{.underline} Top threats include tuberculosis, measles,
influenza, pneumonia, and malaria. Bioterrorism response is a little
more nebulous, since we have not seen a terrorist group successfully use
a biological hazard to cause mass casualties in the United States since
1984. However, following the 2001 Amerithrax incidents, the concern that
they might has thrown a few billion dollars a year toward the Department
of Homeland Security and Department of Health and Human Services to
develop response plans for the possibility.24 [The DOD needs to consider
biological terrorism within its installation force protection plans, but
for the most part, it is not an integral part of that effort due to the
very low probability of such an incident. The DOD does have a massive
CBRN Response Enterprise that would assist states and cities in any
federal response to a biological terrorist incident.]{.underline} The
top (realistic) biological threats usually include salmonella, ricin,
botulinum toxin, sewage, and tainted body fluids. Military biodefense
has focused on protecting U.S. forces from biological warfare agents
developed by adversarial nation-states for the purpose of combat
operations. We have always envisioned biological weapons attacks as
large-area coverage, mass casualty events on the battlefield. Because of
technical challenges, military biodefense capabilities were largely
lacking during the 1991 Persian Gulf conflict, leading to a crash
program in the mid-1990s to develop biological detectors and medical
countermeasures for the services. Biological detection and vaccines were
more readily available in 2003 as U.S. forces prepared for possible
Iraqi biological weapons use. There is a central program office that
manages all DOD biological defense programs, receiving maybe a half
billion dollars a year for funding. Their top threats include anthrax,
pneumonic plague, smallpox, tularemia, and brucellosis. The DOD's
Biological Threat Reduction Program, which is more of an effort to
secure other nations' laboratories and hospitals than biodefense,
accounts for less than a \$300 million in annual funding over the past
decade.25 Biosurety addresses the security and safety of laboratory
research labs both across the United States and within the U.S.
military. Unlike traditional biodefense efforts, biosurety is more about
keeping biologicals safe from humans, as opposed to the other way
around. The threat includes both the possibility that a researcher on
the inside might deliberately or accidentally release a dangerous
biological organism, or that an outsider might try to break in and steal
them. There is also the danger of natural disasters or externally
derived accidents to consider. The U.S. Army has had biosurety failures
that resulted in CDC shutdowns at its Dugway Proving Ground (in 2015 due
to anthrax shipments) and Fort Detrick laboratories (in 2019 due to
unsafe laboratory practices). While the CDC has some oversight role for
a small set of select agents and toxins, in general, the CDC can only
provide suggestions on how the U.S. research and development community
should implement good business practices. This area is not well funded
(maybe \$500 million/year) or overseen from the federal level. The top
threats for biosurety are too varied for listing, but in general,
accidents are largely limited to individual researchers and not the
general community surrounding a biological research lab. Biosecurity and
biosafety challenges within the agricultural and food industries have
been of two parts. First, many facilities have significantly large
amounts of livestock or crops to protect against the introduction of any
foreign disease that might wipe out their livelihood. In addition,
foreign pests or animals could displace or eliminate native animals and
crops. Second, there is the challenge of regulating food products as
they are moved from the farm to the table, as the saying goes. Federal
regulations aim to ensure that agricultural products used in meal
production are both safe and accurately labeled. Both the Food and Drug
Administration and U.S. Department of Agriculture have responsibilities
to oversee this area, in addition to the Customs and Border Patrol.
There is not a significant DOD equity in this area other than ensuring
that meals prepared for the field are safe and free of contamination.
Because Congress is very interested in ensuring that the public has safe
food and a variety of different foods, this area gets funded between \$3
billion and \$4 billion a year. Its biological threats of concern
include foot-and-mouth disease, swine flu, avian flu, wheat rust, and
invasive species such as Asian carp, zebra mussels, cane toads, and
brown marmorated stink bugs. This is just the tip of the challenge of
trying to address all biological threats---natural, deliberate, and
accidental---under one Army, DOD, or national strategy. There are more
complex discussions as to what would constitute a national
biosurveillance effort---surprisingly, this would not be solely focused
on infectious biological diseases to humans, but also include diseases
affecting animals and plants, as well as chemical or radiological
hazards to any biological organism. [There is the challenge of
addressing the impact of future technologies such as "gain-of-function"
and synthetic biology. Even after we identify all of the potential
issues that surround "biological threats,"]{.underline} [there is the
question of who ought to lead the effort.]{.underline} The public health
community claims that if it were better funded, it could address all
natural disease outbreaks as well as respond to biological terrorism.
[The national security community feels that it needs to have a larger
voice in this effort, given that these are foreign threats that impact
the armed forces and other U.S. national security interests. And given
the national security community's funding and ability to quickly form
new project offices, they could very well dominate the discussion, which
could result in different priorities than what the public health
community sees as important.]{.underline} Concluding Thoughts [The
military's primary concern should be on deliberate biological threats,
but there is no question that it has been distracted by COVID-19 and the
general topic of natural disease outbreaks.]{.underline} If the DOD's
Chemical-Biological Defense Program decides to move from working on
countermeasures to biological warfare agents and focus instead on
"threat-agnostic" systems that address all biological threats, the
military will not get necessary detectors, protective ensembles, medical
vaccines, or decontaminants for biological warfare agents due to the
larger number and greater impact of natural infectious diseases. This
is, in essence, what happened in the 1980s; because the military medical
community was focused on research and development for infectious
diseases and not biological warfare agents, U.S. forces were unprepared
for biological warfare in 1990.26 [Military concepts of future war
assure us that biological and nuclear warfare are expected threats to
U.S. forces.27 In the case of a conflict with North Korea, it may not
look that different than Cold War concepts of massive, large-coverage
attacks on U.S. military bases. In the case of China and Russia**, it is
less clear what the future of biological war will be**. As technology
such as drone swarms, artificial intelligence, and synthetic biology
continue to mature, the shape of **biological warfare threats will
evolve**.]{.underline} One can assume that the traditional biological
warfare agents will still be viable candidates, or possibly enhancements
on their natural forms. Terrorist use of biological hazards may be
limited to crude toxins and improvised delivery systems---still a threat
to installation force protection measures, but not necessarily a mass
casualty event. [This future operating environment requires us to focus
on enhancing the survivability of critical infrastructure---in
particular, command and control, power projection, and logistics
bases---and the resiliency of military operations while impacted by
biological weapons]{.underline}. [The only way to succeed in moving
forward in a future biological defense posture is not, then, to dilute
the Army's efforts by trying to manage the development of defensive
capabilities for all natural disease outbreaks and deliberate biological
attacks under a single general construct. There needs to be a
laser-sharp focus on both pandemic preparedness and biological defense
during combat operations.]{.underline} In addition, the DOD needs to
ensure that its biological research and development laboratories have
the best practices in place to avoid future shutdowns due to biosurety
challenges. This is not an either/or discussion nor is it the time to
radically revise how military forces accomplish biological defense.
Instead, [Army leaders need to **engage** in these discussions, despite
the complicated technical nature of the topic, and ensure that future
operations can be maintained despite the threat of biological weapons
use]{.underline}.

Genetic weapons Until the end of the twentieth century, bioweapons meant
pathogens (and possibly animal delivery systems). [The biotech
revolution]{.underline}, and particularly **[the ability to sequence and
translate entire genomes]{.underline}**, has altered that equation.
[Some state militaries, notably China's, are already]{.underline}
publicly [expressing an interest in attacking targets by reordering
their bodily functions through]{.underline} what is known in more benign
applications as **[gene therapy]{.underline}**. Planners in the United
States also note that: The [long term implications of genomics will
present the Army with opportunities and challenges even in the next
decade]{.underline} ... The Army can, however, promote development of
new products and processes that will be consistent with or specific to
its missions and needs. [This will require that the Army be fully aware
of the synergistic effects of biological tools.]{.underline} (Committee
2001, p. 15) "The goal of gene therapy is to effect a change in the
genetic makeup of an individual by introducing new information designed
to replace or repair a faulty gene." This is accomplished by using the
same principle employed since the first smallpox vaccination: [the use
of a harnessed, crippled virus to serve as a "**Trojan horse**"
vector]{.underline}, in this case bearing replacement or supplemental
genes to alter cell functioning. Somatic cell therapy affects only the
cells of the individual receiving it, and for reasons of ethics and
technical feasibility, most therapeutic research has been of this type.
But there is also the technique of germline [cell therapy]{.underline},
which might "[lead to a heritable change that could repair problems for
**all future generations**]{.underline}" (Block, in Drell et al. 1999,
pp. 60--62). Although American military planners are bullish on the
potential for gene therapy to improve the lots of wounded servicemen in
the near future, the technologies are not yet universally acclaimed nor
even accepted. The United States Department of Energy (2009) noted that
the FDA "has not yet \[as of 2014\] approved any human gene therapy
product for sale. Current gene therapy is experimental and has not
proven very successful in clinical trials. Little progress has been made
since the first gene therapy clinical trial began in 1990." This
reaction stems in part from the death and illness of several children
who had received gene therapies to treat life-threatening chronic
conditions. At the same time, however, researchers elsewhere announced
that gene therapy safely and successfully restored partial sight to
congenitally blind test subjects. The results were accomplished by
inserting healthy copies of a missing gene into patient retina cells via
a vector manufactured by a private American company called Targeted
Genetics (University College of London 2008). [Vector-delivered gene
therapies remain an emerging biotech]{.underline}nology, but cases such
as these demonstrate both that [vectors can be used to create
significant physical alterations in targets, and that these changes can
be deadly]{.underline}. The [discovery that **viruses** can be carried
airborne for considerable distances even after the droplets of fluid
constituting their **transmission** media have fallen to the ground
provides further evidence that vectors might soon be used to deliver
genetic therapies -- or maladies -- to **wide target
populations**]{.underline} (The Medical News 2007). With the genetic
maps of entire organisms now available -- the full genome for the plague
bacterium was decoded in 2001 -- it is inevitable that researchers will
develop the means to rewrite specified segments of targeted genes
(Preston 2009, p. 296).

[Much]{.underline} recent [concern relating to synthetic
biology]{.underline} has been [focused on]{.underline} implications for
[traditional bioweapons]{.underline}. Bioweapons programs developed by
the United States and the Soviet Union during the [Cold War shaped the
backbone of biodefense frameworks that exist today]{.underline}. Those
programs focused on manipulation of the most naturally occurring lethal
pathogens, many of which now comprise the U.S. \"Select Agent\" list
that rigorously controls laboratory use, and the international
\"Australia\" list that guides export controls. However, [the ability to
acquire dangerous pathogenic organisms is no longer relegated to
isolating them from nature, or stealing them from
laboratories]{.underline}. [**Gene synthesis** tools allow **pathogens**
to be recreated \"from scratch,\" based on their known genomic
sequences]{.underline}, and DNAs are commercially available from a
growing number of gene synthesis companies around the world.
Reconstruction of viruses such as polio,5 1918 flu,6 and most recently
horsepox7 are proof of principle. Cold War era bioweaponeers wanted to
alter pathogens to make them deadlier, to spread more easily, or to
evade diagnosis and treatment. While this kind of manipulation of
pathogenic organisms remains challenging, the tools of today\'s
biotechnology could be used to achieve these goals with fewer technical
challenges. The versatile genome editor, [CRISPR]{.underline}, is a
[good example of a programmable, inexpensive tool that could rewrite
genetic code to alter pathogens in ways that prior weapons programs
aspired to]{.underline}. [There is]{.underline} also a [possibility of
creating novel bioweapons]{.underline}, which do not currently exist on
any lists and would [be hard to prevent, detect, and treat]{.underline}.
Further, while growing pathogens to scale, storing them stably, and
delivering them to target populations proved to be the most challenging
aspects of bioweapon development[, the tools of today\'s
biotech]{.underline}nology might [make these steps more
achievable]{.underline}. The convergence of other technologies - such as
nanotechnology and gene therapy - could enable the development of new
delivery methods.As industry becomes more adept at the biological
creation of chemicals, there is [greater overlap of biological and
chemical weapons]{.underline}. The world has seen degradation of norms
against chemical weapons use quite recently, and it is not a stretch to
worry that bad actors may use biological methods to create drugs or
chemical toxins. For example, the fermentation process for opioids from
yeast8 and marine conotoxins from E. coli 9 have already been described
in the literature. Of course, biothreats to humans are only one
component of the risk; threats to plants, the environment, and materiel
are also in play. The recent National Academies\' studies explored [the
arena of potential biothreats to DOD s warfighters]{.underline}. They
concluded [that while existing frameworks for biodefense are still
viable and important to maintain, the **widened scope** of threat
**necessitates** **expansion** of preparedness and response capabilities
**beyond** list-based paradigms]{.underline}. While these potential
enablers of biothreats cannot and should not be minimized, this is in
some sense familiar territory: public health and animal health
infrastructures will still serve as strong primary defenses. Approaches
to cast a wider net can include focusing on the pathways through which
agents cause harm, rather than a list of the agents themselves.10 Within
the familiar territory of public health, the [tools of synthetic biology
could be game-changing in combating biothreats]{.underline}.11 For
example, [next-generation sequencing and digital screening tools might
be used to identify novel or engineered agents]{.underline},12 [and
synthetic gene]{.underline}s and circuits could be [used to develop
rapid diagnostics tools]{.underline}. Synthetic biology could
[enable]{.underline} the design of novel [countermeasures]{.underline},
[such as the use of CRISPR to fight antibiotic
resistance]{.underline}.13 Platforms that speed such countermeasure
development are in fact already underway.14 Finally, synthetic biology
offers the means to manufacture high-value compounds that have
heretofore only been available through traditional chemistry, or through
harvesting from plants or other organisms. This innovation may mitigate
resource scarcity that would be problematic in an outbreak. In light of
these clear advantages, risk-benefit analyses will be critical for
assessing the role of emerging biotechnology in the future. Based on
these considerations, [key questions for policymakers and national
security specialists include]{.underline}:

■ What [frameworks]{.underline} should be used in the United States and
elsewhere [to assess the risks and benefits of emerging
biotech]{.underline}nology, including synthetic biology? The National
Academies risk framework, along with others, could be considered in
international policy venues such as the Biological Weapons Convention.15

■ Given the widening threat space caused by synthetic biology, [how
should international governance be shaped if list-based security
paradigms can no longer encompass the threat]{.underline} ? List-based
biosecurity currently touches every component of biodefense.

■ [What would compel bad actors to harness these emerging capabilities
to create and use bioweapons]{.underline} ?

Whether bad actors will adopt the capabilities of synthetic biology to
create and use biological or chemical weapons may largely depend upon
their goals[. The ability to act asymmetrically or covertly may be
compelling - as may be the ability to cause fear and social instability,
if not widespread lethality. Better analysis of actor intent could
foster the development of stronger deterrents by the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and allies]{.underline}

)

[Introduction China's national strategy of military-civil fusion
(军民融合, junmin ronghe) has highlighted biology as a
priority.]{.underline} \[1\] It is hardly surprising that the People's
Republic of China (PRC) is looking to leverage synergies among defense,
scientific, and commercial developments in biological interdisciplinary
(生物交叉, shengwu jiaocha) technologies. [Chinese military scientists
and strategists have consistently emphasized that biotechnology could
become a "new strategic commanding heights of the future Revolution in
Military Affairs"]{.underline} (军事革命, junshi geming) (PLA Daily,
October 2015). Certainly, the PRC is not alone in recognizing the
potential of biotechnology on the future battlefield, but the ways in
which Chinese research is seeking to integrate developments among
industry, academic institutions, and military-oriented
programs---including through research collaborations and the procurement
of dual-purpose commercial technologies---may prove striking. [In
particular, China is at the forefront of today's breakthroughs in
CRISPR-Cas, a new technique for gene editing that has demonstrated
unique potential and precision despite its current limitations. \[2\]
The Biological Revolution in Military Affairs Chinese military officers
and scientists anticipate that current advances will contribute to an
ongoing transformation in the character of conflict. Indeed, senior
officers and academics in the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA)
have not only highlighted concerns about "**national biological security
(and) defense**" (国家生物安全防御, guojia shengwu anquan fangyu) in
response to the threats of infectious diseases, but also emphasized the
importance of exploring the military potential and even offensive
applications of biotechnology]{.underline} (China News Network, February
15, 2012; Ministry of Science and Technology, April 18). \[3\] For
instance, Senior Colonel Guo Jiwei (郭继卫) of the PLA's Third Military
Medical University co-authored War for Biological Dominance (制生权战争,
Zhishengquan Zhanzheng), which examined the impact of biotechnology on
the Revolution in Military Affairs. \[4\] [The concept zhishengquan
(制生权), which might be translated variously as "**biological
dominance" or "command/superiority in biology," is starting to become
more prevalent** in PLA writings on future warfare of varying degrees of
authoritativeness.]{.underline} \[5\] Notably, Major General He Fuchu
(贺福初), former president of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences
(AMMS) and now vice president of the Academy of Military Sciences, has
long been a prominent proponent of the militarization of biotechnology
(PLA Daily, October 6, 2015). Maj. Gen. He has anticipated that ["Modern
biotechnology and its integration with information, nano(technology),
and the cognitive, etc. domains will have **revolutionary influences**
upon weapons and equipment, the combat spaces, the forms of warfare, and
military theories"]{.underline} (Reference News, August 24, 2017).
Consequently, pursuant to this new "Revolution in Military Affairs,"
success on the future battlefield will require achieving "biological
dominance," and this "biological frontier" (生物疆域, shengwu jiangyu)
of warfare will emerge as a new domain for new methods of confrontation.
In the course of this transformation, the progress of such techniques as
brain-machine interfaces could render human-machine integration
(人机一体化, renji yitihua) a reality for future combat platforms. For
instance, AMMS researchers have engaged with a commercial enterprise
known as Cogrowth (酷成长, ku chengzhang) that specializes in the
development of a line of products involving electroencephalograms (EEG)
for brain-computer interfaces, which is exploring leveraging artificial
intelligence to interpret bio-signals (Economics Daily, December 25,
2017; Sina, December 28, 2017). Chinese military researchers have
closely examined American initiatives and international advancements,
which have seemed to inform and inspire the direction of developments
underway in China today. For instance, DARPA's launch of the Biological
Technologies Office has drawn attention, and PLA scholars have also
examined exotic accounts Russia's "zombie gun" (僵尸枪, jiangshi qiang),
based on electromagnetic radiation, and referenced supposed Israeli
programs to target Arabs with genetic weapons (Sohu, 2012). \[6\] The
salience of these concerns about foreign programs and the tragedy of
China's own history does not appear to have resulted in restraint
against considering the potential operational advantages of such
offensive applications. \[7\] For instance, although writings about
"genetic weapons" should not be interpreted as official doctrine or
formal concepts of operations, it is noteworthy to see striking
parallels in themes repeated by a number of PLA scholars and scientists
from influential institutions. Certain discussions about the future of
"military struggle in the domain of biology" are troubling. [For
instance, seemingly authoritative textbooks have included references to
the possibility of "**specific ethnic genetic attacks"**
(特定种族基因攻击, teding zhongzu jiyin gongji), while other military
experts characterize the notion of a "ethic bionation" as
erroneous]{.underline} (China News, July 19, 2018). \[8\] According to
Gen. Zhang Shibo (张仕波), former president of the PLA's National
Defense University, today's biotech advances unlock the possibility to
create new synthetic pathogens that are "more toxic, more contagious,
and more resistant." \[9\] ["Obviously, genetic weapons possess many
advantages over traditional biological weapons,"]{.underline} as one
researcher from the Academy of Military Medical Sciences has argued
(China Military Network, November 10, 2017). [In particular, the
weaponization of CRISPR is expected to prove more lethal and more
precise in ways that could cause major changes in the dynamics of future
warfare, despite the risks that would be inherent in its employment and
the current limitations of this nascent technology. In the long term,
genetic weapons are anticipated to have more of a "strategic deterrent
function,"]{.underline} and the AMMS researcher has warned that "willful
abuse of genetic weapons will bring unpredictable disasters to all
mankind" (China Military Network, November 10, 2017). Such theories and
speculation about future capabilities could become actual possibilities
for the PLA pursuant to academic and commercial research that is
currently underway.

#### China has [developed]{.underline} the technology pathogenic warfare

**Cyranoski 17** (Cyranoski, David. "Inside the Chinese Lab Poised to
Study World\'s Most Dangerous Pathogens." Nature News, Nature Publishing
Group, 23 Feb. 2017,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.21487.)

[A laboratory in Wuhan is on the cusp of being cleared to work with the
world's most dangerous pathogens. The move is part of a plan to build
between five and seven biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) labs across the Chinese
mainland by 2025, and has generated much excitement, as well as some
concerns. **Some scientists outside China worry about pathogens
escaping**, and the addition of a biological dimension to **geopolitical
tensions** between China and other nations.]{.underline} But Chinese
microbiologists are celebrating their entrance to the elite cadre
empowered to wrestle with the world's greatest biological threats. "It
will offer more opportunities for Chinese researchers, and our
contribution on the BSL‑4-level pathogens will benefit the world," says
George Gao, director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory
of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology in Beijing. There are already
two BSL-4 labs in Taiwan, but the National Bio-safety Laboratory, Wuhan,
would be the first on the Chinese mainland. The lab was certified as
meeting the standards and criteria of BSL-4 by the China National
Accreditation Service for Conformity Assessment (CNAS) in January. The
CNAS examined the lab's infrastructure, equipment and management, says a
CNAS representative, paving the way for the Ministry of Health to give
its approval. A representative from the ministry says it will move
slowly and cautiously; if the assessment goes smoothly, it could approve
the laboratory by the end of June. BSL-4 is the highest level of
biocontainment: its criteria include filtering air and treating water
and waste before they leave the laboratory, and stipulating that
researchers change clothes and shower before and after using lab
facilities. Such labs are often controversial. The first BSL-4 lab in
Japan was built in 1981, but operated with lower-risk pathogens until
2015, when safety concerns were finally overcome. The expansion of
BSL-4-lab networks in the United States and Europe over the past 15
years --- with more than a dozen now in operation or under construction
in each region --- also met with resistance, including questions about
the need for so many facilities. [Viruses don't know
borders.]{.underline} The Wuhan lab cost 300 million yuan (US\$44
million), and to allay safety concerns it was built far above the flood
plain and with the capacity to withstand a magnitude-7 earthquake,
although the area has no history of strong earthquakes. [It will focus
on the control of emerging diseases, store purified viruses and act as a
World Health Organization 'reference laboratory' linked to similar labs
around the world.]{.underline} "It will be a key node in the global
biosafety-lab network," says lab director Yuan Zhiming. The Chinese
Academy of Sciences approved the construction of a BSL-4 laboratory in
2003, and the epidemic of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)
around the same time lent the project momentum. The lab was designed and
constructed with French assistance as part of a 2004 cooperative
agreement on the prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases.
But the complexity of the project, China's lack of experience,
difficulty in maintaining funding and long government approval
procedures meant that construction wasn't finished until the end of
2014. [The lab's first project will be to study the BSL-3 pathogen that
causes Crimean--Congo haemorrhagic fever: a deadly tick-borne virus that
affects livestock across the world, including in northwest China, and
that can jump to people. Future plans include studying the pathogen that
causes SARS, which also doesn't require a BSL-4 lab, before moving on to
Ebola and the West African Lassa virus, which do.]{.underline} Some one
million Chinese people work in Africa; the country needs to be ready for
any eventuality, says Yuan. "Viruses don't know borders." Gao travelled
to Sierra Leone during the recent Ebola outbreak, allowing his team to
report the speed with which the virus mutated into new strains1. The
Wuhan lab will give his group a chance to study how such viruses cause
disease, and to develop treatments based on antibodies and small
molecules, he says. The central monitor room at China's National
Bio-safety Laboratory. Credit: Muyi Xiao for Nature The opportunities
for international collaboration, meanwhile, will aid the genetic
analysis and epidemiology of emergent diseases. "The world is facing
more new emerging viruses, and we need more contribution from China,"
says Gao. In particular, the emergence of zoonotic viruses --- those
that jump to humans from animals, such as SARS or Ebola --- is a
concern, says Bruno Lina, director of the VirPath virology lab in Lyon,
France. Many staff from the Wuhan lab have been training at a BSL-4 lab
in Lyon, which some scientists find reassuring. And the facility has
already carried out a test-run using a low-risk virus. But [worries
surround the Chinese lab, too. **The SARS virus has escaped from
high-level containment facilities in Beijing multiple
times**]{.underline}, notes Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at
Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. Tim Trevan, founder of
CHROME Biosafety and Biosecurity Consulting in Damascus, Maryland, says
that an open culture is important to keeping BSL-4 labs safe, and he
questions how easy this will be in China, where society emphasizes
hierarchy. "Diversity of viewpoint, flat structures where everyone feels
free to speak up and openness of information are important," he says.

challenges than at any time in its past]{.underline}. Additionally,

[Scientific and technological innovations have been the backbone of
American economic, military, and political power]{.underline} since the
advent of the industrial revolution. Federal support for research and
development was invigorated by the arguments and evidence put forth in
Vannevar Bush's now-famous report to the President in July 1945.6 At
that time, the revolutionary power and security implications of
research-driven development of the atomic bomb was palpable to American
policymakers, the civilian leadership in the Department of War, and the
armed forces. Advances in [federally-sponsored technology made the
United States and its armed forces the most technologically advanced in
the world.]{.underline}

What are the roles and significance of emerging technologies and how
should the national security community respond to the promise and perils
of emerging technologies? How will these nascent scientific and
technological developments impact local, regional, and international
security, stability, and cooperation? What are the most likely sources
of technological surprise with the largest threat capacity, and how can
the national security community better identify them sooner? [Emerging
technologies present regional security challenges and may **exacerbate**
(or mitigate) the **geo-political, military, energy, and economic
challenges** in the future to a state or region and the potential
impacts on U.S. interests and **national security**. Deep strategic and
practical understanding of the significance of emerging technology and
its diffusion as well as extending thinking concerning how science,
technology, and **inter- and intra-national social relations** interact
to shape and facilitate management of the changing global security
landscape is a pressing need for the 21st Century.]{.underline}

\-\--it's inev, just a matter of how we can deal with it

[Cognitive Warfare is all around us]{.underline}. Cognitive Warfare is
already being used, [with more or less success]{.underline} and not
necessarily under that name[, by a number of state and non-state
players]{.underline}, institutions or companies, [including
terror]{.underline}ist [organizations]{.underline}, aggressive religious
movements, etc. These actors include specialized and highlycompetent
units working for digital intelligence services, as well as industry
agencies and companies engaged in competition with others or in the more
routine area of marketing and manipulation of potential clients. In all
these cases, [the object is to dominate, establish one's superiority, or
even conquer and destroy]{.underline}. Today these practices have
reached such a level that political leaders can no longer ignore their
importance. The term « Cognitive Warfare » has been used with that
meaning in the United States since 2017, to describe in particular the
modes of action available to a state or influence group seeking to
"manipulate an enemy or its citizenry's cognition mechanisms in order to
weaken, penetrate, influence or even subjugate or destroy it". While
that broad mission has always formed a part of the art of war, here we
have a new discipline that requires further elucidation. It is the
combination of the newer cyber techniques associated with information
warfare and the human components of soft power, along with the
manipulation aspects of psychological operations (or PSYOPS). They
usually involve a biased presentation of a reality, usually digitally
altered, intended to favour one's own interests. [New communication
tools now offer infinite possibilities, opening the way to new methods
and new objectives]{.underline}. This increased complexity should
encourage potential victims to develop a constant posture of resilience,
even if in most cases, victims usually realize they were attacked too
late. [This approach to Cognitive Warfare has caught the eye of armed
forces across the world and includes both strategic and operational
aspects]{.underline}, some of which are more developed than others[. It
is not currently covered by established ethical considerations and
doctrines. Cognitive Warfare]{.underline} expanded considerably with the
arrival of digital strategic decision-making assistants, new operational
domains and the invasion of big data and analytics, in the realm of
information, wargaming and the conduct of operations. It **[is now
spreading to all areas where digital information is used]{.underline}**,
including the quiet implementation of offensive and defensive uses,
cognitive attrition, and defensive measures intended to protect target
populations. It is a mix of well-thought out attack processes as well as
counter and preventative measures.

scope of their ambitions on this front, taking shape over many years, is
coming into view. The deepening relationship between China and Russia is
driven in part by a shared narrative that the United States and the
European Union are constraining their interests and that they are using
information and technology to exert leverage over their adversaries.
Putin and the Chinese Communist Party have cracked down on free
expression, independent media, and internet freedoms largely to counter

alternative sources of information reaching domestic audiences---and to
legitimize these methods internationally. Though **[Russian and

### 2AC -- Yes Russia Biowarfare -- Ukraine

#### Russia is incentivized to start biological warfare

Ben **Connable** **5-15**-22 Ben Connable is a nonresident senior fellow
at the Atlantic Council and adjunct professor of security studies at
Georgetown University. (Will Putin use chemical weapons in Ukraine?,
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/will-putin-use-chemical-weapons-in-ukraine/>)
// WA

With Russia's war in Ukraine foundering, **[there are increasing fears
that Vladimir Putin might unleash]{.underline}** chemical or
**[biological weapons]{.underline}** on Ukrainian soldiers and
civilians. How realistic is this scenario? **[Putin knows there is a
special terror associated]{.underline}** **[with]{.underline}** chemical
and **[biological weapons]{.underline}**. Ukrainians have good reason to
fear their use: the effects are awful. But delivering chem-bio weapons
is difficult and dangerous even for well-trained professional soldiers.
There is little to suggest Russian troops would be successful. Chemical
[weapons](https://www.opcw.org/our-work/what-chemical-weapon) like
nerve, blistering, and choking agents are designed to kill or maim
victims. For example, Russia used Novichok nerve agent in an attempt to
murder political opponents in
[Salisbury](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58635137) in 2018.
[Biological](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1326439/)
agents like ricin and botulism are deadly or incapacitating toxins or
diseases. For example, shortly after the 9/11 attacks, an unknown
assailant sent weaponized
[anthrax](https://www.justice.gov/archive/amerithrax/docs/amx-investigative-summary.pdf)
through the US mail in an unsuccessful effort to kill members of
Congress. I experienced the fear of chemical attack firsthand while
examining suspicious unexploded shells during the 1991 Gulf War, and
while invading Saddam Hussein's Iraq in 2003. I never quite knew if my
chemical suit or mask were fitted just right, or if a tiny gap had
opened up that might have exposed me to unspeakable suffering. Luckily I
experienced nothing but false alarms. But even those unfounded fears
were sobering. Others have not been so lucky. Saddam
[used](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4330124) poison gas to kill
thousands of Iranian troops in the Iran-Iraq War. He also deployed
chemical weapons to murder thousands of his own people. More
[recently](https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/06/03/russia/syria-flurry-prohibited-weapons-attacks),
Syrian civilians experienced deadly chemical attacks launched by their
own Russian-backed government. **[Russia almost certainly
[retains](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2022/03/harvard-analyst-assesses-chemical-weapon-threat-posed-by-russia/)
a sizable
[store](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/03/19/russia-chemical-weapons-ukraine/)
of chemical and biological weapons]{.underline}**. **[Moscow's
[commitments](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GAOREPORTS-NSIAD-94-136/html/GAOREPORTS-NSIAD-94-136.htm)
to destroy the last vestiges of its Soviet-era stockpiles are no more
believable than any random story on Russian state media]{.underline}**.
But having these terrifying weapons and putting them to effective use
are two different matters. I see at least three reasons why the use of
chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine could go badly wrong for the
Russians. There is little doubt that direct attribution would be
unavoidable for any Russian chemical weapon attack in Ukraine.
**[Experts on chem-bio weapons and Russian tactics
[assume](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/us-warns-russia-use-chemical-weapons-false-flag-operation-ukraine-rcna19391)
the Russians would try to use a [false
flag](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60434579) operation to deny
responsibility for their attack. They might attempt to make it look like
the Ukrainians attacked their own civilians in an effort to discredit
Russia, or they might even try to pin the blame on NATO.]{.underline}**
This could still be an effective tactic for the Russian domestic
audience, but the days of gaslighting Western leaders and reporters are
over. Advanced Western surveillance, detection, and forensics will not
allow Russia's armed forces to secretly deploy chem-bio weapons.
Russia's [failure](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/03/1086012) to
cover up even its most highly classified assassination
[attempts](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/23/skripal-salisbury-poisoning-decline-of-russia-spy-agencies-gru)
suggest it would fail even more spectacularly to cover up much larger
battlefield attacks. The chance of grave errors in chemical weapon
delivery would be very high. Delivering chem-bio weapons is a
complicated task best left to well-trained and practiced professionals.
It is highly unlikely that Putin's air, ground, or missile forces have
[retained](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000284028.pdf) the
[skills](https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/2012-071-doc-1-part-1.pdf)
necessary to ensure safe and effective delivery of these deadly weapons
from storage to target. First, they must transport the weapons without
mishap. Some containers, bombs, and shells are so old that their often
caustic payloads may be leaking. Next, they have to prepare the weapons
for delivery by airplane, missile, or artillery strike. This involves
careful handling by soldiers trussed up in head-to-toe protective gear,
a fraught prospect even under ideal conditions. Even before they launch
their attacks, Russian soldiers would be at high risk of catastrophic
failure. It is important to note that Russian ground forces are not
prepared to capitalize on chem-bio attacks. **[Launching these weapons
can cause terror, injury, and death.]{.underline}** But chem-bio attacks
are not magical. They will not kill everyone they affect, and weaponized
gasses cannot seize or hold territory. Simply firing these weapons into
civilian areas like Kharkiv or Kyiv is likely to harden rather than
weaken Ukrainian and Western resolve. **[Chemical weapons are used most
effectively to soften up targets for follow-on ground
attack]{.underline}**.
[Troops](https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/ARN32065-ATP_3-11.74-000-WEB-1.pdf)
wearing protective gear must push
[forward](https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/Doctrine/pubs/jp3_11.pdf)
into the contaminated zone riding in protected vehicles supported by
decontamination trucks while carrying lots and lots of extra protective
supplies**[. Given the present state of Russian forces in Ukraine and
the probable lack of advanced chem-bio training, this would be all but
impossible.]{.underline}** If the Russians try to push their own troops
into a chem-bio environment they are likely to suffer much the same fate
as their victims. **[The Russian military can certainly attack Ukraine
with chemical and biological weapons]{.underline}**. But they probably
cannot do so effectively or without significant risk to their own
forces. Russia will be caught out and, in keeping with its overall
strategic failure in Ukraine, achieve little more than increasing
international opprobrium and isolation. Putin would be wise to leave his
chemical and biological weapons safely tucked away in cold storage or,
better yet, to destroy them as promised.

NBIC is a scientific project bringing together four heretofore distinct
domains: nanotechnology (nano-robot technology, nano-sensors,
nanostructures, energy\...), biotechnology (bio-genomic technology,
CRISPR-Cas9, neuropharmacology\...), information technology (computer
science, microelectronics\...) and cognitive technology (cognitive
science and neuropsychology). The project was formalized with the
encouragement of the US Defence Department in 2002 and subsequently
taken up by major international institutions and a number of nations, to
bring together future technologies. Figure 3: [Convergent
tech]{.underline}nologies as defined [by the US DOD]{.underline} in the
Roco and Bainbridge Report (2012). The object [is to encourage the
development of tools and adapt or improve humans through an
anthropo-technical approach to develop a hybridized
man-system]{.underline} to meet health, security, defence objectives and
prepare them for specific bioenvironments (space, sea, deserts, etc.).
Today, [this project has led to the partial convergence of
domains]{.underline}, mostly through pairing information technology and
health nanotechnologies, new chemical cognition enhancers, embedded
electronics, etc. Ultimately, the goal is that it will lead to an
augmented human operator (or even a hybrid one), injected with
amplifying substances or nanotechnologies, providing informational
resilience and superiority. [A number of **enhanced soldier** projects
are already underway.]{.underline} Information, of course, can imply
cyber threats and information distortion or manipulation. And a
connected brain, in particular a soldier's connected brain, will lead to
offensive and defence forms of 'cognitive warfare'. Many writers have
already imagined what threats might emerge. Most of them remain
science-fiction, but some projects are benefiting from real resources,
programmed and in some cases tested, with for instance neurocomputing
implants and perception augmenting technical hybrids (vision and
hearing), or even genomic modifications. [Beyond traditional and
existing threats associated with cognitive warfare]{.underline} as used
by allied or competing nations, or those that might be developed by
unofficial entities (such as terrorists or entities seeking cultural or
religious domination), [we need to think about the future of NBIC, and
how it might influence human cognition]{.underline}, by distracting,
saturating or even taking over and modifying objectives. We should also
mention the issue of these implants' obsolescence and their
exploitation. Conclusion [The cyber world is now all-encompassing,
ever-present and no decision or action can be executed without the tools
it provides]{.underline}. This obviously affects the cognition of those
who use them and will impact individuals and groups, at all levels, both
psychologically, with human consequences, and technically when human
errors impact systems. [This is a fast-growing domain and new paths are
constantly pushing back the limits of our knowledge and what potential
uses might be developed]{.underline}. [It is imperative we try to
**anticipate threats** born of future tech]{.underline}nologies and
learn more about those being developed today. These
[threats]{.underline} are increasingly common and their consequences,
more often than not, [will have global repercussions]{.underline},
[**requiring NATO** and its member Nations to think about **cognitive
warfare's** varied dimensions]{.underline}. To anticipate them [will
mean acquiring the means to go **beyond** a reactive posture. If
militaries remain reactive, it will lead to **losing** the
tech]{.underline}nological [initiative that is so **vital** to military
strategy today.]{.underline}

Defense R&D While some military (or potentially military) applications
of biotechnology are indeed products of the private sector, it is no
state secret that [militaries actively sponsor their own biotech
r]{.underline}esearch [and d]{.underline}evelopment
[programs]{.underline}. The United States Department of Defense in
particular is open about the large number of such projects that it
oversees. And while most of these are described as intended for troop
protection, many are clearly **[intended to enhance combat
operations]{.underline}**. As with pathogen stockpiles maintained
ostensibly for defensive research, it is only the intent of the wielder
that determines whether or not they are offensive. And as the 2001
anthrax case illustrates, [even projects officially intended for
defensive purposes may be misapplied]{.underline}. Much of the biotech
research is conducted under the auspices of the Pentagon's DARPA rather
than legacy programs remaining from the era of bacteriological weapons
stockpiles. Established in 1958 as a response to the launch of the first
Sputnik satellite by the Soviet Union the year before, DARPA was
intended to promote "high-risk -- high-payoff" R&D in areas beyond the
immediate envisioned needs of military planners. The Agency's singular
most influential project has undoubtedly been a communications system
that came to be known as DARPANET before penetrating -- and transforming
-- the commercial sector as the internet (Van Atta 2008, pp. 20, 23,
27). While a reported 90% of its projects fail to come to fruition,
[high-profile DARPA research]{.underline} that [has had a significant
impact on U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [military
capability]{.underline} includes Saturn rockets, ground radar, stealth
fighters, Predator missiles, and drones. The agency's budget of \$3
billion is small compared to intelligence agencies, but it supports an
"open culture" promoting "radical innovation" praised by participant
scientists, most of whom are university researchers (Moreno 2006, pp.
12--13, Basken 2013). In 2014, **[DARPA announced the creation of a new
Biological Technologies Division]{.underline}**, built from existing
research units and new programs, [intended to ensure that biotechnology
is not merely an aspect of various research programs, but that "biology
takes its place among the core sciences that represent the future of
defense technology."]{.underline} The new division's primary [goals
include to "restore and maintain warfighter abilities," and "to enhance
global-scale stability"]{.underline} (DARPA 2014). Similarly, the
Pentagon Office of Net Assessment (ONA), which envisions potential
future strategic environments and challenges, has also promoted biotech
R&D as a defense priority. In 2002, the ONA recommended revising Federal
regulations to allow experimental biotechnologies to be brought to the
battlefield more readily. It also called for facilitating a greater
partnership with private sector researchers by restricting anti-trust
laws to permit quicker product development (Armstrong and Warner 2003).
In biotech in particular, the military has an advantage over the private
sector because it does not have to go through the lengthy and rigorous
clinical testing and approval process for medical devices and treatments
(Wheelis, in Pearson et al. 2007, p. 4).

As described in the Five-Year Plans (FYPs) and other national
strategies, [China has identified and acknowledged the technical,
economic, medical, military, and political value of the brain
sciences]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} has [initiated efforts to
expand]{.underline} its current [neuroS/T programs]{.underline}. [China
utilizes]{.underline} broader [strategic planning]{.underline} horizons
than other nations [and]{.underline} attempts to [combine efforts from
government, academic, and commercial sectors (i.e., the "**triple
helix**") to accomplish **cooperation and centralization** of national
agendas.]{.underline} This [coordination]{.underline}
[enables]{.underline} research [projects]{.underline} and objectives to
be used for a range of applications and outcomes (e.g., medical, social,
military). As noted by Moo Ming Poo, director of China's Brain Project,
[China's]{.underline} growing [aging population is contributing
to]{.underline} an increasing incidence and prevalence of
[dementia]{.underline} and other neurological diseases. In their most
recent FYP, [China addressed economic and productivity
concerns]{.underline} fostered by this aging population, [with a call to
develop medical approaches for neurological disorders]{.underline} and
to expand research infrastructure in neuroS/T. This growing
[academic]{.underline} environment [has been leveraged to]{.underline}
attract and [solicit multi-national collaboration]{.underline}. In this
way, [**China is affecting international neuroS/T** through]{.underline}
(1) [research **tourism**]{.underline}; (2) [control of
**i**]{.underline}ntellectual **[p]{.underline}**roperty; (3) medical
tourism; [and]{.underline} (4) [**influence** in]{.underline} global
[scientific thought]{.underline}. While these strategies are not
exclusive to neuroS/T; they may be more opportunistic in the brain
sciences because the field is new, expanding rapidly, and its [markets
are]{.underline} growing, and [being defined]{.underline} by both share-
and stake-holder interests. [Research tourism involves]{.underline}
**[strategically recruiting]{.underline}** renowned, experienced
[scientists]{.underline} (mostly from Western countries), as well as
junior scientists to contribute to and promote the growth, innovation,
and prestige of Chinese scientific and technological enterprises. This
is apparent by two primary efforts. First, [initiatives such as
the]{.underline} [Thousand Talents Program]{.underline} (launched in
2008) and other programs (e.g., [Hundred Person Program, Spring Light
Program, Youth Thousand Talents Program]{.underline}, etc.) aim to
[attract foreign researchers]{.underline}, nurture and sustain domestic
talent, and bring back Chinese scientists who have studied or worked
abroad. Further, [China's ethical research guidelines are]{.underline},
in some domains, somewhat [more permissive]{.underline} than those in
the West (e.g., [**unrestricted human** and/or non-human primate
**experimentation**]{.underline}), and the director of China's Brain
Project, Mu-Ming Poo, has stated that this capability to engage
[research that may not be (ethically) viable]{.underline} elsewhere may
(and [should]{.underline}) explicitly [attract international scientists
to]{.underline} conduct research in [China]{.underline}. Second, China
continues to engage with leading international brain research
institutions to foster greater cooperation. These cooperative and
[collective research efforts enable China to achieve a more even
"playing field"]{.underline} in the brain sciences. [China
leverages]{.underline} intellectual property ([IP]{.underline}) policy
and [law to advance]{.underline} ([and veil]{.underline}) neuroS/T and
other [biotechnologies]{.underline} in several ways. First, via
[exploitation of their patent process]{.underline} by [creating a
"patent thicket]{.underline}". The Chinese patent system focuses on the
end-utility of a product (e.g., a specific neurological function in a
device), rather than emphasizing the initial innovative idea in contrast
to the U.S. system. [This enables Chinese companies]{.underline} and/or
institutions [to copy]{.underline} or outrightly usurp
[foreign]{.underline} patents and [products]{.underline}. Moreover,
[Chinese patent laws allow international research]{.underline} products
and ideas [to be used in China]{.underline} "for the benefit of public
health," or for "a major technological advancement." Second, the
aforementioned [coordination of]{.underline} brain [science institutions
and the corporate sector establishes **compulsory
licensing**]{.underline} under Chinese IP and patent laws.
[This]{.underline} strategy (i.e., "[lawfare]{.underline}")
[allows]{.underline} Chinese [academic and corporate enterprises to have
economic and legal support, while]{.underline} reciprocally [enabling
China to direct]{.underline} national [research]{.underline} agendas and
directives through these international neuroS/T collaborations. [China
enforces its patent and IP rights worldwide, which can create **market
saturation** of]{.underline} significant and [innovative
products]{.underline}, [and could create]{.underline} **[international
dependence upon Chinese neuroS/T]{.underline}**. Further, Chinese
companies have been heavily investing in knowledge industries, including
artificial intelligence enterprises, and academic book and journal
partnerships. For example, [TenCent established a
partnership]{.underline} [with Springer Nature to engage]{.underline} in
various [educational products. This will allow]{.underline} a
significant stake in future [narratives]{.underline} and dissemination
[of]{.underline} scientific and [technological discoveries]{.underline}.
[Medical tourism is]{.underline} explicit or implicit
[attraction]{.underline} and solicitation [of international individuals
or groups to seek interventions]{.underline} that are either only
available, or more affordable in a particular locale. Certainly, [China
has]{.underline} a presence in [this]{.underline} [market]{.underline},
and at present, available procedures range [from]{.underline} the
relatively sublime, such as using deep brain stimulation to treat [drug
addiction, to]{.underline} the seemingly "science-fictional", such as
the recently proposed body-to-[head transplant]{.underline} to be
conducted at Harbin Medical University in collaboration with Italian
neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero. [China can advance and develop areas of
neuroS/T in ways that **other countries cannot or will not**, through
**homogenizing** a strong integrated "bench to bedside" capability and
use of non-Western ethical guidelines]{.underline}. [China
may]{.underline} specifically target treatments for diseases that may
have a high global impact, and/or could [offer procedures]{.underline}
that are not available in other countries (for either socio-political or
ethical reasons). [Such medical tourism could create]{.underline} an
**[international dependence]{.underline}** [on]{.underline} [Chinese
markets as individuals become reliant on products and services available
only in China]{.underline}, in addition to those that are "made in
China" for ubiquitous use elsewhere. China's growing biomedical
industry, ongoing striving for innovation, and expanding manufacturing
capabilities have positioned their pharmaceutical and technology
companies to prominence in world markets. Such positioning -- and the
somewhat permissive ethics that enable particular aspects and types of
experimentation -- may be seductive to international scientists to
engage research, and/or commercial biomedical production within China's
sovereign borders. [Through]{.underline} these tactics of [economic
infiltration and saturation, China can create]{.underline} [power
hierarchies that induce]{.underline} strategically latent
"[bio-political]{.underline}" [effects that influence]{.underline} real
and perceived positional dominance of [global markets]{.underline}.

### 2AC -- Yes China Biotechnology -- Land Warfare

#### Chinese biotechnology poses national security risks to the US

**Fang 19** (Frank Fang is a Taiwan-based journalist. He covers US,

https://www.theepochtimes.com/us-report-chinas-biotech-industry-poses-threat-to-us-national-security_2804427.html?welcomeuser=1.)

[Clinical and genetic data of U.S. citizens obtained by **Chinese
biotechnology companies through their partnerships with U.S.
institutions could pose national security risks**, according to a newly
published congressional report.]{.underline} The risks stem from the
"dual use of biotechnology information," the U.S.--China Economic and
Security Review Commission (USCC) said in a report published Feb. 14.
[For instance, genetic and medical analyses used in the biotech industry
to develop tailored treatments for patients "**could be used for
malicious purposes** in the hands of a foreign state government, such as
China."]{.underline} In a hypothetical situation, foreign states such as
China could possibly blackmail individuals with the threat of exposing
their embarrassing medical information, according to the report. In
another situation, [the foreign state could use information on health
conditions, such as allergies, to conduct a targeted attack against
diplomats, politicians, high-ranking federal officials, or military
leaders, to "induce an allergic reaction or fatal injury." Much like
health records, **genetic data could also be exploited** as research
about the links between genetic traits and personality traits becomes
more advanced in the future.]{.underline} For instance, foreign
intelligence officials, knowing in advance which individuals have
genetic markers such as loyalty and susceptibility to flattery, would be
able to know how to exploit or blackmail those persons. China's biotech
industry has grown rapidly in the last decade, according to the report,
with the market now estimated at 30 billion to 40 billion yuan (\$4.7
billion to \$6.2 billion), compared to the U.S. biotech market at \$118
billion. "[As a major element of China's biotechnology growth, Chinese
biotech companies are utilizing U.S. firms to acquire technologies and
data that bolster their current capabilities through a variety of
channels]{.underline}," the report stated. Some of these channels
included foreign direct investment, mergers and acquisitions, venture
capital, corporate and academic partnerships, and recruitment of
U.S.-trained foreign and Chinese-born researchers. The report also
warned, "[China's biotech industry may have also **benefited from
illicit extraction of overseas technology** through espionage or the
theft of trade secrets."]{.underline} One confirmed example was the case
of Zhang Weiqiang, a Chinese national living in Manhattan, Kansas, who
was sentenced in April 2018 to 10 years in prison for stealing samples
of genetically engineered rice seeds from his employer Kansas-based
Ventria Bioscience. Zhang intended to transfer the samples to a crop
research institute in China. Zhang's case was one of 11 cases that
occurred between from 2001 to 2017 involving Chinese espionage and trade
secret theft in the United States identified by the report. BGI One
example of China getting its hands on U.S. data is highlighted in the
report: via BGI Group, a private genome sequencing center based in the
southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, with subsidiaries including BGI
Genomics, which is listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, and a research
institute. BGI was previously known as the Beijing Genomics Institute.
In 2011, BGI and University of California Davis announced a
collaboration in which the Chinese company would set up a genetic
sequencing facility at the university's Sacramento campus. That same
year, BGI and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia also established a
collaborative genome center. In 2013, BGI acquired U.S. sequencing
company Complete Genomics for \$117.6 billion, according to the report.
"By collecting data across many efforts \[partnerships with U.S.
entities\], BGI may be amassing a database of genomic and healthcare
data on US persons that is greater than that achieved through any single
research endeavor," the report stated. While BGI is a private company,
the company has definite ties to the Chinese Communist Party. In January
2018, China's state-run media Xinhua reported that Du Yutao, the Party
secretary of BGI's research institute, spoke of the importance of
learning and putting into action of "the spirit behind the 19th National
Congress," referring to the Party's once-in-five-years leadership
transition event. In China, companies and organizations are required to
establish Party organizations to ensure they toe the Party line. Du had
spoken at the institute's Party committee meeting designed to discuss
Chinese leader Xi Jinping's speech at the 19th National Congress held in
October 2017. BGI has also received state support, including a ten-year,
\$1.5 billion loan from China Development Bank in 2010. According to
Chinese search engine Baidu, Du was selected as a provincial
representative from southern China's Guangdong Province to attend the
19th National Congress. The USCC report also warned that the Chinese
regime has laws in place that require private companies to give up data
at any time. Two laws passed in 2015, National Security Law,
Counter-Terrorism Law, and the Cybersecurity Law in 2016, were largely
aimed at internet and telecommunications companies, but "their broad
scope of does not preclude their application to a wider range of
companies such as those harboring genomic or other personal data," the
USCC report said. China's State Policies Biotech is among several tech
sectors the Chinese regime has named as a "Strategic Emerging Industry"
in economic plans such as "Made in China 2025" and the 13th Five-Year
Plan. China unveiled "Made in China" in May 2015 as a blueprint for
transforming China into a high-tech powerhouse by 2025. Less than a year
later, in March 2016, Beijing released its latest Five-Year Plan, which
sets out to strengthen the implementation of Made in China 2025 from
2016 to 2020. The USCC report identified several Chinese state-run tech
R&D programs to boost the country's biotech sector, including the "863"
and "973" programs, with the former dating back to 1986 and the latter
in 1997. According to the report, Beijing poured \$630 million into
funding the 973 program in 2013. [**Biotech has also been a focus of
Beijing's talent programs** in the past few years, the report stated,
listing several national level programs such as the Hundred Talents
Program and Thousand Talents Program.]{.underline} Regional governments
in China also run hundreds of similar programs. "Out of the estimated
2,629 current recruits in the Thousand Talents program as of June 2018,
44 percent specialize in life sciences or medicine," the report stated,
citing figures from a U.S. congressional hearing. The report pointed out
that the dangers lie in China's fundamentally different political
system: "China is a Leninist-style one-party state based on rule-by-law
not rule-of-law. [China's economic ambitions and intentions present
challenges for more liberal economies."]{.underline} The report
recommended that the United States adopt policies to mitigate ["against
economic and security risks posed by **China's statist approach** to
innovation without stifling US innovation."]{.underline}

The international balance of power [With the emergence of advanced
biotech]{.underline}nologies, many of which already exist or are being
[developed for expressly military purposes, the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [holds the potential for achieving a decisive
advantage in power projection capabilities beyond the reach of its
current **adversaries**]{.underline} and most of its likely potential
competitors. Besides the United States, other actors are expanding their
biotech R&D sectors, notably the emerging great powers China and India,
where force planners must consider the usage of bioweapons in Asian
theaters of combat in both classical and modern times (Clunan et al.
2008). [China is developing its military capabilities]{.underline} to
become a regional power at the least, **[and advanced
biotech]{.underline}**nologies **[could play a role in this
effort]{.underline}**. "[As the Chinese military expands its power
projection capabilities, it will concentrate on creating
**asymmetrical** advantages in the face of **superior US** conventional
tech]{.underline}nology" (NTI 2003). [Chinese military medical
researchers have written]{.underline} a number of [articles
proposing]{.underline} the [use of proteomic weapons to engage in
non-lethal "precision injury" attacks that could be healed upon enemy
surrender as evidence of hegemonic "mercifulness."]{.underline} Despite
the evident offensive strategic potential of such research -- one such
article is titled "The Command of Biotechnology and Merciful Conquest"
-- there is still evidence of the constraints of international norms
against biowarfare. Indeed, the author claims that biotech warfare
approaches "abide by the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention more
effectively, and strike a blow on the traditional bioweapons, therefore
welcoming new military progresses and reforms, and changing the notions
and civilization level of war" (Guo 2006, pp. 1152--1154). India, with
its reliance on the Green revolution to attempt to achieve food
sufficiency, has spent the last two decades encouraging the development
of agricultural biotechnologies. Many of these advances were facilitated
using extensive knowledge of genetic engineering, which in turn provided
information on the de novo synthesis of biological agents. Whether such
synthesis has actually been done is uncertain. India has made
substantial efforts to prepare its military force for a biological
attack. In December of 1998, India began to train its medical personnel
to deal with the eventualities of such an attack. (NTI 2009) India's
equivalent of DARPA, the Defense Research & Development Organization
operates a network of 52 laboratories whose research includes life
sciences for military purposes. These include the Defense Institute of
High-Altitude Research and the Defense Food Research Laboratory
(Department of Biotechnology, Government of India 2013, p. 20). Its
reported products parallel those investigated by its American
counterparts, including treatments to combat altitude sickness,
transgenic crops, and protective polymers for uniforms, although
products are frequently described in terms of their commercial rather
than strategic potentials (Defense Research & Development Organization
2015). One widely cited [potential threat to **international
security**]{.underline} from biotechnology is that, [as more actors
become involved in research into militarized biotech]{.underline}nology,
**[the threat of dissemination to non-state actors increases through the
increased availability of production equipment and available
data]{.underline}**. Maurer (in Maurer 2009, p. 86) notes that
commercially available micronizers are sold that can produce 1--10 μm
particles, and in their advertising material, the "companies boast that
they can be operated by 'anyone ... in their garage.'" And [non-state
actors with interests in such tech]{.underline}nologies [have
been]{.underline} quite [busy utilizing]{.underline} such [machinery in
the past decade]{.underline}, with individuals referred to as "garage
hackers" [operating autonomously with small pieces of equipment and
biological material]{.underline} that can be purchased from suppliers
over the internet (United States House of Representatives 2005, p. 30).
Still, because such proliferation occurs over time, and because research
by defense establishments will continue during this period, including in
biodefense, the most sophisticated uses of biotech will remain in the
arsenals of advanced state actors just as they do with conventional
armaments today, despite the proliferation of surplus conventional arms.
Rather than being the "poor man's nuclear weapon," twenty-first-century
[biotechnology will]{.underline} actually [provide a decided
**asymmetrical** advantage to **major powers** that will **complement**
their **superiority** in conventional forces]{.underline}.
Technologically advanced states will be far more likely to be able to
counter classical "germ warfare" like anthrax attacks by rogue states
and non-state groups than will be actors bereft of a biotech industry to
mount defenses against vectors that introduce engineered viruses, or
proteomic weapons that disrupt human bioregulators.

Developments in science and technology (S&T) impact both the character
and nature of warfare profoundly. [New innovations are turning out to be
disruptive and **any military which takes the lead in absorbing the same
would have a significant, perhaps decisive, edge over
others.**]{.underline} The Chinese Defence White Papers reiterate the
importance of powerful and modern armed forces in achieving the 'Chinese
Dream'. True to this, [China has taken **giant steps** towards
modernising and transforming its armed forces. It has moved from
Civil-Military Integration to Military-Civil Fusion so as to exploit the
latest developments in S&T for advancing its military
capabilities.]{.underline} In fact, President Xi Jinping heads the
Central Commission for Military-Civil Fusion Development established in
2017. In Shenzhen, the Central Military Commission Science and
Technology Commission has established the National Defense Science and
Technology Innovation Rapid Response Group to 'promote the integration
of military and civilian development in the field of science and
technology and to use advanced commercial technology to serve the
military.'1 The second round of military reforms China implemented,
helped in syncing the doctrine-writing done by the Academy of Military
Science (AMS) with the new, S&T-driven capabilities. Such is the
emphasis on S&T that Chinese Communist Party committees have been
planted into more than 35 Chinese technological companies to ensure
oversight!2 He Fuchu of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS),
[Beijing, sees bio-crossing technologies as tools which will make
'biological weaponization' possible and indeed, as the battlefield has
continued to expand in the inanimate realm from the land to the sky,
sea, space, networks, etc., the animate realm consisting of human cells
and cognitive abilities (the neuropsychiatric system) would become the
next frontier for the battlefield to cross.]{.underline}3 [This is
exactly the thought that is guiding the Chinese pursuit of 'zhishenquan'
or '**command and superiority in the bio-domain**' as they expect "a
series of biological revolutions with 'smart' as the
core."]{.underline}4 In fact, way back in 2010, Guo Jiwei of the then
Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University post the
military reforms in 2017) co-authored a book titled 'War for Biological
Dominance' examining the military impact of Biotechnology.5
[Bio-crossing technologies, especially Biotechnology, are being pursued
so that China can 'seize the initiative' in this field.]{.underline}6 Is
the People's Liberation Army (PLA) involved in research pertaining to
the enhancement of human cognitive abilities through gene-editing, use
of drugs, etc.? In 2011, the AMMS unveiled Night Eagle, a drug it
claimed would help its troops remain awake for up to 72 hours with
minimum cognitive degradation.7 A company by the name Cogrowth is using
artificial intelligence (AI) to interpret brain signals, which may, in
future, be the basis for weapons being controlled by the power of
thought!8 [Furthermore, in 2015, He Fuchu of the AMMS, postulated that
**advances in biotechnology could lead to the creation of 'cerebrum
control' weapons.**]{.underline}

Timing can make a big difference in a career. Is it worthwhile to stay
longer in a comfortable job or is it the right moment to strike out for
a new challenge? Similarly, timing can make all the difference when
deciding to enter a developing market like China. Just a decade ago,
when China-born scientists with overseas experience began returning to
the country, lured by their homeland's fast growth and growing financial
means, they found a drug industry dominated by generics. Undeterred,
they got busy building the infrastructure for an industry capable of
drug discovery and development, buoyed by substantial government support
and a thriving economy. Part of Career guide: China Today, [biotech
specialists arriving in China find **an industry at a turning point**,
with many key elements in place for innovation: a university system
churning out doctorates and strong basic research, substantial financial
backing from both the private and public sectors, regulations that are
becoming globally harmonized and a vibrant group of entrepreneurial
leaders with ambitions for China and abroad]{.underline}. They also find
a country facing significant unmet medical needs --- particularly in
cancer, neurology and diabetes --- and a rapidly ageing population.
Although China is the world's second largest pharmaceutical market after
the United States, some of the most effective modern medicines are not
on sale. For example, of the 42 cancer drugs approved globally in the
past five years, only four are available in China. But this is set to
change. Recent regulatory changes will bring imported drugs to China
more quickly, and local biotechs are racing to develop domestic --- and,
they hope, global --- blockbuster drugs. [For academics and
entrepreneurs, it is an ideal time to build on the biotech investments
of the past,]{.underline} says Lan Huang, chief executive of New
York-based BeyondSpring Pharmaceuticals, which is running drug trials in
China. A hunger for science It only took two visits to Shanghai's
Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park to convince Greg Scott to set up a life-science
consulting business there, amid a hotbed of drug research and
development (R&D) companies. He founded ChinaBio in 2007, and encourages
others to consider a move to China. "Do it! It is a great experience,"
he says. "If I was helping someone plan their career, China has to be a
part of it as the number one drug market outside the United States." It
is not just entrepreneurs and multinational drug company employees; many
academic and staff scientists also find working in China a stimulating
career move. Ray Stevens, a chemist renowned for determining the crystal
structures of the body's receptors, which are important for identifying
drug targets, can recall the exact moment he decided to trade sunny
California for Shanghai, uprooting his school-age children and wife.
Like many academics, he had visited China several times, but it was not
until 2009, after delivering a talk on membrane proteins to colleagues
in the neighbouring city of Suzhou, that he decided to make the move.
"One of the big attractions was the energy and excitement the students
had for science. It won me over," Stevens says. After he had finished
his talk, "a group of students came up to the podium to ask questions.
They kept asking questions as I made my way to the bathroom and even
followed me in. I was amazed; they were so hungry. It was the moment I
decided to spend my sabbatical in China". In 2011, Stevens moved to
China as a visiting professor. Just a year later, the president of
ShanghaiTech University, Mianheng Jiang, came calling, offering the
chance to set up his own institute. He now runs the iHuman Institute at
ShanghaiTech, is a member of China's Thousand Talents Plan and was in
2017 awarded a Magnolia Prize, an accolade given to foreigners who have
contributed significantly to Shanghai's development. He has also
co-founded a biotech company, RuiYi, in Shanghai. Building biotech The
passion for science that Stevens discovered did not spring up
accidentally. [It has been fostered by **government support for
biotechnology that has intensified** over the past decade, creating a
force attracting scientists and the entrepreneurially inclined to China.
Of the 2 million returnees to China over the past 6 years, it is
estimated 250,000 work in the life sciences. And, although many
scientists making the move were born and raised in China and have a
decade or more experience working in the West, non-Chinese speakers such
as Stevens and Scott are coming and thriving here, too. The push for
innovation comes from the highest levels of government, with the biotech
industry receiving special attention in not just one but three of the
government's latest five-year plans: the strategic blueprints that
determine the country's economic goals for the forthcoming half-decade.
The latest plan, China's thirteenth, stipulates that the biotechnology
sector should exceed 4% of gross domestic product by 2020 and that
**there should be 10 to 20 life-science parks for biomedicine with an
output surpassing 10 billion yuan (US\$1.5 billion).** China has more
than 100 life-science parks dotted across the country; run by local
governments, these hubs lure companies with tax breaks and subsidies.
**It is estimated that more than \$100 billion has already been invested
in the life-sciences sector** by state, provincial or local governments
in an effort to hit the five-year-plan targets.]{.underline}China gains
a strategic advantage and is closing the gap

#### Biotech has become a [strategic]{.underline} sector for China--they are slowly [closing]{.underline} the gap

Cooperation." Foreign Policy Research Institute, 25 May 2022,

[The People's Republic of China's rise as a **global innovation power**
is rooted in the development of a sovereign innovation infrastructure,
one that allows China to compete in high-technology races with the
United States. This process is complemented by an intensifying science
and technology partnership with the Russian Federation.]{.underline} By
decoupling from China and Russia, the United States and its allies are
pushing China and Russia closer to each other. The paper discusses
recent examples of Sino-Russian biotechnology cooperation projects,
offering an early account of the emerging integration of two distinct
but complementary innovation infrastructures. Introduction The People's
Republic of China's emergence as a global power is rooted in the rapid
development of a sovereign innovation infrastructure, one that allows
China to compete in high-technology races with the United States.
China's build-up of its innovation infrastructure is complemented by
another process: an intensifying cooperation with the Russian Federation
in security, trade, energy supplies, artificial intelligence, 5G, space
research, and biotechnology. Moscow and Beijing have a complicated
history of interactions. Previously, China and the Soviet Union were
isolated from the world market of technology, and after the Sino-Soviet
relationship worsened, they were also isolated from each other. However,
today, in light of deteriorating relations with the United States,
strategic alignment emerges. The U.S. and the European Union's
decoupling from business with China and imposing economic sanctions on
Russia push the two countries to examine the potential of their
strategic cooperation more closely.\[1\] Innovation Infrastructure China
and Russia are very different in terms of their innovation performance.
China has an ascending trajectory and has already advanced to
self-sufficient manufacturing of "sophisticated intermediate
goods."\[2\] It is well integrated into global innovation networks,
while Russia is not. Since the break-up of the Soviet Union, Russia has
been sliding down a descending trajectory.\[3\] It became a natural
resource exporter heavily dependent on imports of foreign technology.
Regardless of these differences, Beijing and Moscow are actively
developing a joint innovation infrastructure. The two countries declared
2020 and 2021 the "Cross Years of Russian and Chinese scientific,
technical, and innovation cooperation."\[4\] China demonstrated its
ability in launching and managing large-scale projects and leads in
Sino-Russian partnerships. Most of the infrastructure projects take
place under the auspices of the Belt and Road Initiative.\[5\] For
example, one of its institutes is Russia-China Investment Fund, a
private equity fund established jointly by the Russian Direct Investment
Fund and China Investment Corporation, which equally committed USD 2
billion.\[6\] Lomonosov Moscow State University (left) and Tsinghua
University Campus (right). (Adobe Stock) The purpose of building this
type of infrastructure is to accelerate Sino-Russian partnerships in
science and technology and facilitate technology transfer. In 2020, the
two countries announced the construction of the first Sino-Russian
Innovation Complex, a joint venture of Tus-Holdings, Russian Direct
Investment Fund, Tsinghua University, and Lomonosov Moscow State
University. The purpose of this Innovation Complex is to prepare for
future joint research and development centers, university labs for basic
research, and science parks. This project followed the establishment in
2016 of the first Sino-Russian university founded by Beijing Institute
of Technology, Shenzhen Municipal People's Government, and Lomonosov
Moscow State University.\[7\] The new university's mission is to "to
nurture talents for the Belt and Road Initiative."\[8\] Few joint
research centers, for instance, in computational mathematics and
cybernetics, were launched, and there are plans to open other centers in
chemistry and materials, biology, and space science.\[9\] In addition,
the Russia-China Investment Fund, in partnership with Tus-Holdings,
supports the construction of the Sino-Russian High-Tech Innovation Park
at the Skolkovo Innovation Centre. According to the press release,
"Tus-Holdings is considering the possibility to create a network of
innovation facilities in Russia by building new technology parks in
other areas of the country."\[10\] Another science and technology park
within Lomonosov Moscow State University is anticipated and is expected
to "become a platform for innovative cooperation between scientific and
technological workers and scientific and technological enterprises of
the two countries."\[11\] These projects are recent, and at the moment,
it is unclear whether they would be successful in spurring actual
innovation in the near future. What is clear, though, is that their
proliferation in the last few years signals the commitment to closer and
long-term integration of the Russian and Chinese innovation systems.
Such integration is incremental and might take decades. In the words of
Tus-Holdings Chairman Jiwu Wang, the company's vision is "an ecosystem
of innovative cooperation in science and technology between China and
Russia . . . and deepening economic integration between the two
countries" \[emphasis added\].\[12\] (sputnikvaccine.com) Biotechnology
Chinese-Russian technological alignment has been particularly apparent
in the sector of biotechnology. Broadly, biotechnology refers to the
manipulation of living organisms or their compounds to produce new
products or services. Biotechnology is perceived to be "a key strategic
technology for industrial growth" and is distinguished from other
technological sectors for its capacity to alter the means of production
across a variety of industrial sectors.\[13\] Examples of the sectors
include pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and food processing, and extend to
dual-use technologies. [**Biotechnology is a strategic sector for
China.** The Made in China 2025 Initiative sets the goal of
manufacturing high-tech products, including innovative medicines.\[14\]
The plan introduced targets for Chinese pharmaceutical firms to advance
in biotechnology innovation and increase exports.\[15\]
About]{.underline} half of all industrial parks in China focus on the
development of pharmaceuticals.\[16\] By 2018, China established 111
biotechnology science parks.\[17\] [Although China still lags behind the
U.S. in biotechnology innovation, analysts concede that **it is rapidly
progressing and closing this gap.**\[18\] So far, **China's efforts have
concentrated on creating the necessary infrastructur**e for
biotechnology development. In turn, Russia has rich natural resources,
but over 80% of biotech products are imported, and Russia's share in the
global market of biotech products is below 0.1%.]{.underline}\[19\]
Russian biotech is a sector that experienced massive brain drain after
the break-up of the Soviet Union, with many scientists leaving for
Western countries and Israel.\[20\] The persistent challenge for the
Russian biotechnology industry, including the biopharmaceutical
industry, is its critical dependency on imports. Between 1992 and 2014,
the production of substances (active pharmaceutical ingredients)
decreased by a factor of 20.\[21\] According to the Ministry of
Industrial Policy of Russia, in 2015, the country imported 95% of active
pharmaceutical ingredients required to produce finished
pharmaceuticals.\[22\] In 2018, the share of foreign medicines on the
Russian market constituted 70.2% by value and 39.4% by volume. In 2019,
foreign medicines generated USD 19.6 billion in income, which was about
70% of the Russian pharmaceutical market.\[23\] By some accounts, this
sum is larger than what Russia earns from its arms export.\[24\]
Pharmaceutical imports exceed exports by 14 times.\[25\] By all formal
indicators in life-science research and biotechnology, such as gross
domestic product (GDP) expenditure on R&D, patents, and journal
publications, Russia lags behind the United States, China, France, South
Korea, Japan, Germany, and India.\[26\]

#### China is closing the gap--they intend to take over the sector

[**China is rapidly gaining on the United States when it comes to
creating technology** that mitigates disease threats and developing
pharmaceuticals faster, and it's a phenomenon driven by a philosophy
that the state, military, and the private sector are one in the
same.]{.underline} That was the testimony of Tara J. O'Toole, senior
fellow and executive vice president at In-Q-Tel, before the U.S. Senate
Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. The
hearing, Biological Threats to U.S. National Security, examined
everything from China's push to develop biotechnology infrastructure to
luring research scientists away from the United States to work in China.
["China has said repeatedly and forcefully, and they're backing up their
words with actions, that **they intend to own the
biorevolution,**"]{.underline} O'Toole said. ["And they are building the
infrastructure, the talent pipeline, the regulatory system, and the
financial system they need to do that."]{.underline} China is partly
accomplishing this by combining its internet giants, such as Alibaba,
with its biotech companies. [The combined strength of these companies'
research focuses on the industrialization of artificial intelligence in
which China is "institutionalizing it" whereas the United States is only
"experimenting with it," O'Toole added**. China's goal is to make
biotechnology 5 percent of the country's GDP** by 2020. China has
changed regulations for its own version of the Food and Drug
Administration to be more like that of the United States in order to
more easily market to the world. The country has created a talent
pipeline that incentivizes its own students to go into the life sciences
and bioengineering. China also has at least 20 programs intended to
bring scientific talent from the rest of the world. There are good
reasons China is going after the biorevolution: it has the highest
incidences of cancer on earth and the population is aging. **It also
must find an affordable way to deliver health care to a rising middle
class.**]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Yes China BCIs

#### China is ahead in BCI development -- low trust, authority, and cohesion hurt U.S. efforts, but R&D can solve

Bottom Line Up Front: **[China is better poised to capitalize on
disruptive neurotechnologies like brain-computer
interfaces]{.underline}** (BCI) **[for both civilian and military
usage]{.underline}**, so [the U.S. must be prepared for the deployment
of these capabilities in future operating environments.]{.underline}

In the past decade, seven international actors have launched "Brain
Projects" or "Brain Initiatives," including the United States and China.
The [U.S. BRAIN]{.underline} Initiative started in 2013 under the Obama
administration, and [includes]{.underline} plans for [\$6
billion]{.underline} USD [of funding through]{.underline} the year
[2025]{.underline}. [The China Brain Project]{.underline} was announced
three years later in 2016, along with the country's Thirteenth Five-Year
Plan [with]{.underline} estimated [funding of]{.underline} [\$1
billion]{.underline} USD [through]{.underline} the year
[2030]{.underline}.

[These]{.underline} brain initiatives which [involve stakeholders from
government, academia, military, and industry]{.underline} and direct
hundreds of millions of dollars to specific research goals, can be
viewed as cohesive articulations of a national strategy for neuroscience
research. The [outcomes]{.underline} of these initiatives will not only
further our understanding of the brain but will also enable new
neurotechnologies that [will have far-reaching implications for society,
public health, and national security.]{.underline}

[The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and **China**
are]{.underline} among [the **largest spenders**]{.underline} in their
brain projects and are peer economic and military competitors. [The
U.S.]{.underline}' National Defense Strategy in 2018 [highlighted
long-term, strategic competition with China as a top focus]{.underline}.
This competition will naturally include vying for technological
advantage, especially with emerging technologies like those enabled by
the brain projects, to avoid technological surprise. Here,
[the]{.underline} specific [focus on brain-computer interfaces
within]{.underline} the broader category of [neurotechnologies is due to
their potential for high adoption by healthy people for both civilian
and military purposes]{.underline}. Additionally, [these]{.underline}
devices [have]{.underline} profound [ethical concerns involving **data
privacy** and **individual autonomy**]{.underline}. Likely for these
reasons, the US Congressional Research Service identified brain-computer
interfaces as an emerging dual-use technology that should be considered
for export controls.

**[China]{.underline}** [has a clearer articulation of
their]{.underline} **[intent]{.underline}** [to use]{.underline}
brain-computer interfaces (**[BCIs]{.underline}**) [for
both]{.underline} **[civilian and military]{.underline}**
[purposes]{.underline}. The goals of the brain initiatives in each of
these nations are an articulation of national strategy for neuroscience
research and technology development, and [the U.S. BRAIN Initiative and
China Brain Project contrast strongly in their aims]{.underline}. [The
China Brain Project's stated goals place a **higher emphasis**
on]{.underline} brain-machine technologies like **[BCI]{.underline}**
[than]{.underline} the [U.S. BRAIN Initiative]{.underline}. [The U.S.
BRAIN Initiative's]{.underline} seven major [goals only relate
to]{.underline} [understanding the brain and improving treatment of
brain disorders]{.underline} and focus on developing technologies that
enable basic research and clinical applications. [The China Brain
Project's]{.underline} structure is [envisioned]{.underline} as "one
body two wings", with a core body of understanding the brain, with an
equal emphasis on the [applications]{.underline}---the two wings---of
treating brain disorders and developing brain-machine intelligence
technologies. In contrast to the U.S. BRAIN Initiative, the China Brain
Project puts [an equal emphasis on clinical and non-clinical
applications]{.underline} of brain research, and specifically emphasizes
integrating brain and machine intelligence.

[The China Brain Project's goals]{.underline} also more strongly [align
with the]{.underline} **[military rhetoric of the PLA]{.underline}**
[than the U.S. BRAIN Initiative's goals do with the U.S. military's
active neurotechnology research initiatives]{.underline}. [The U.S. DoD
has]{.underline} extensively [funded neuroscience research, but
with]{.underline} **[divergent aims]{.underline}** [from]{.underline}
the [U.S. BRAIN]{.underline} Initiative. [DARPA has]{.underline} several
ongoing [programs developing neurotechnologies]{.underline}, like the
Next-Generation Nonsurgical Neurotechnology (N3) program, which seeks to
develop non-invasive BCIs with the ability to both read and write brain
activity for use by healthy military service members, and the Neural
Engineering Systems Design (NESD) program, which seeks to develop BCIs
to restore vision and hearing to injured service members. Other
neurotechnology development programs have been funded by the U.S. Air
Force, the U.S. Army, and the U.S. Navy. A comprehensive study from the
U.S. Army's Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) highlighted
four neurotechnology applications for future operating environments,
including visual and auditory augmentation, wearable exoskeletons with
programmed muscular control, direct control of weapon systems through
BCIs, and brain-to-brain communication between service members. While
both the U.S. DoD and the U.S. BRAIN Initiative have funded clinical
applications of BCI, the DoD's emphasis on civilian and military use
cases for BCI is not reflected in the US BRAIN Initiative's goals.

In contrast, the [PLA's rhetoric]{.underline} and the China Brain
Project's goals [are]{.underline} more [cohesive]{.underline},
[driven]{.underline} likely in part [by]{.underline} the nation's
overarching strategy of [military-civil fusion]{.underline}. The
Director of the Central Military Commission Science and Technology
Commission (CMC S&TC) in China stated in 2017 that " [The combination of
artificial intelligence and human intelligence can achieve the optimum,
and human-machine hybrid intelligence will be the highest form of future
intelligence]{.underline}. In strikingly similar language, Dr. Mu-Ming
Poo, one of the lead scientists of the China Brain Project, has written
on how he believes a better understanding of the brain will
revolutionize artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and how he
expects C[hina to accelerate "development of next generation AI with
human-like intelligence and brain-machine interface
technology]{.underline}." Greater **[alignment]{.underline}** [between
the national strategy for neuroscience research]{.underline} as
articulated by the brain initiatives [and defense emphasis on
neurotechnology]{.underline} development [will]{.underline} likely
[enable]{.underline} **[quicker BCI adoption for military usage in
China]{.underline}**.

[China has **fewer sociocultural barriers**]{.underline} [to BCI
adoption]{.underline} for civilian and military usage [than the
U.S]{.underline}. One of the potential barriers identified by policy
experts to the military usage of BCI in the U.S. was distrust of service
members. This is reflected in the broader civilian population, where in
a 2016 Pew Research survey on human enhancements, [**69%** of U.S.
respondents said they are **worried** by]{.underline} the idea of
[BCI]{.underline} technologies and **[66%]{.underline}** claimed they
[would not]{.underline} want to [use BCI]{.underline} technologies to
enhance their brain. Cross-cultural surveys on attitudes towards BCI
have not been conducted, so it is difficult to make direct, specific
comparisons between U.S. and Chinese citizen's attitudes towards BCI.
However, a cross-cultural study on U.S. and Chinese attitudes towards
big data technologies has been conducted; while this 2017 survey does
not address BCI technologies directly, BCI technologies are like big
data technologies in that they will utilize machine learning and large
sampling of potentially individualizable data. [U.S. respondents were
less likely than Chinese respondents to approve of
technologies]{.underline} that involved data collection from
individuals. U.S. responders were also strongly averse to the use of big
data analytics by the government, where [Chinese respondents were mostly
favorable to government usage]{.underline}. [U.S. respondents were
only]{.underline} more [favorable]{.underline} of big data analytics
usage than their Chinese counterparts [when data could be
anonymized]{.underline} and used by businesses to improve performance.
[Data privacy and anonymity were more important]{.underline} to U.S.
respondents. [BCI]{.underline} technologies [by necessity collect
data]{.underline} from individuals [and can]{.underline} even [affect
brain activity]{.underline}, so these technologies have features [that
will make them less appealing]{.underline} for adoption in the U.S.

Additionally, **[China]{.underline}**, due to its government structure,
[can **mandate the usage of BCI** technologies]{.underline} both
[in]{.underline} the [civilian and military sectors]{.underline}. [There
are already]{.underline} media [reports of mandatory BCI
usage]{.underline} by companies [in]{.underline} [China]{.underline}
where there have not been similar reports in the United States. Both the
U.S. and China have seen non-invasive EEG headsets that can read brain
activity used in school settings, usually in pilot studies for devices
designed to measure focus and attention. However, [Chinese state-owned
companies]{.underline} that run power plants and train operations have
reported usage of this same kind of headset to [monitor workers'
attention or sleep]{.underline}/awake [status]{.underline}. This
application is also advertised by companies operating [in the
U.S.,]{.underline} but [no]{.underline} reports exist of it being
[mandatory]{.underline} to [use]{.underline}. While the efficacy of
these headsets is likely low due to difficulties interpreting brain
activity collected via EEG, this signals that [Chinese state companies
are more likely to use these types of devices to monitor
workers.]{.underline}

[The U.S. must]{.underline} prepare now to [mitigate the **adverse
effects** of disruptive dual-use neurotechnologies]{.underline}.
[Neurotechnologies have]{.underline} incredible [potential]{.underline}
[to improve]{.underline} quality of [life]{.underline} for people
suffering from sensory, motor, or other clinical deficits.
[Yet]{.underline} they also have the potential to fundamentally [disrupt
social systems]{.underline} and future operating environments. [Both the
U.S. and its peer competitor, China, have funded research for BCIs and
have stated goals for their usage in future operating
environments]{.underline}. [While the U.S.]{.underline} likely
[has]{.underline} **[greater funding]{.underline}** for neuroscience
research through the U.S. BRAIN Initiative and a more robust R&D system
[with greater]{.underline} **[public-private
partnerships]{.underline}**, [China has]{.underline} **[fewer
barriers]{.underline}** to BCI adoption [due to its sociocultural
climate, government structure, and a more cohesive national
strategy]{.underline} for neuroscience research. Additionally, [the
U.S.'s general **R&D advantage is eroding**,]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} [China looking to compete with]{.underline} the
[U.S.]{.underline} on [R&D within the next decade.]{.underline}

Many ethical and legal quandaries arise due to human enhancement through
BCIs, since these technologies involve the collection and modification
of very personal data---an individual's brain activity. It is important
now for the U.S. to consider the ethical, legal, and social implications
(ELSI) of BCI usage and take the lead in establishing norms for their
usage both in civilian and military contexts. Additionally, the U.S. can
capitalize on its current R&D lead for developing BCIs if they can lower
sociocultural barriers to adoption. One suggested method for addressing
distrust for BCIs is through positive media portrayals of BCI usage.
Regardless, the U.S. must be prepared for BCIs to be utilized in future
operating environments by peer competitors and for BCIs to be potential
disruptors in civilian contexts.

with the military rhetoric of the PLA than the U.S. BRAIN Initiative's
goals do with the U.S. military's active neurotechnology research
initiatives. The U.S. DoD has extensively funded neuroscience research,
but with divergent aims from the U.S. BRAIN Initiative. DARPA has
several ongoing programs]{.underline} developing neurotechnologies, like
the Next-Generation Nonsurgical Neurotechnology (N3) program, [which
seeks to develop non-invasive BCIs with the ability to both read and
write brain activity for use by healthy military service
members,]{.underline} and the Neural Engineering Systems Design (NESD)
program, which seeks to develop BCIs to restore vision and hearing to
injured service members. Other neurotechnology development programs have
been funded by the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Army, and the U.S. Navy. A
comprehensive study from the U.S. Army's Combat Capabilities Development
Command (DEVCOM) highlighted four neurotechnology applications for
future operating environments, including visual and auditory
augmentation, wearable exoskeletons with programmed muscular control,
direct control of weapon systems through BCIs, and brain-to-brain
communication between service members. [While both the U.S. DoD and the
U.S. BRAIN Initiative have funded clinical applications of BCI, the
DoD's emphasis on civilian and military use cases for BCI is not
reflected in the US BRAIN Initiative's goals]{.underline}. In contrast,
[the PLA's rhetoric and the China Brain Project's goals are more
cohesive, driven likely in part by the nation's **overarching strategy
of military-civil fusion.**]{.underline} The Director of the Central
Military Commission Science and Technology Commission (CMC S&TC) in
China stated in 2017 that ["]{.underline} [The combination of artificial
intelligence and human intelligence can achieve the optimum, and
human-machine hybrid intelligence will be the highest form of future

on how he believes a]{.underline} [better understanding of the brain
will revolutionize artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies]{.underline} and how he expects China to accelerate
"development of next generation AI with human-like intelligence and
brain-machine interface technology." [Greater alignment between the
national strategy for neuroscience research as articulated by the brain
initiatives and defense emphasis on neurotechnology development will
likely enable quicker BCI **adoption for military usage in

### 2AC -- Yes Russia Biotechnology

#### Russia is prioritizing and developing biotechnology in multiple sectors and can lead in biotechnology

Development of Russian Biotech Sector." Foresight (Cambridge), vol. 19,

Biotechnologies are one of the fastest growing "horizontal"
technological directions that form the basis for future economic
transformations. New achievements in promising areas of biotech are in
high demand because they can help to guarantee food supplies, sustain
the supply of resources, increase life spans and improve health. The
crisis of traditional technologies (including environmental and
energy-related ones) provides new opportunities for this area's
development. According to OECD estimates, in 2030, biotechnologies may
be used for 35 per cent of chemical industry production, 50 per cent of
agricultural production and 80 per cent of pharmaceuticals (OECD, 2010).
The development pathways in this area should be determined by
achievements in the fields of systemic, structural and synthetic
biology; genomics; proteomics; and cellular technologies. In Russia,
more than 80 per cent of biotechnological products are imported, which
is why the development of the bioeconomy is an essential factor for the
modernization of the economy in the country. In addition, Russia has a
significant potential for introducing biotechnology into the industry.
For example, in 2010, the world market for bioenzymes amounted to
\$2.8bn, at the same time in Russia in 2013, it was only \$0.18bn. New
institutional and organizational changes taking place abroad lead to an
accelerated development of this area (e.g. permission for gene editing
of human embryo or widespread distribution of genetically modified
organisms \[GMOs\]) (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine, 2016;). In the event that the effective state policy in the
field of biotechnology is not implemented, a lag from the advanced
countries may become unattainable. Without effective state support,
Russia can forever fall behind the leading countries. In this regard, it
is so important to select key biotech areas taking into account the
available potential. At present, even the most developed countries
cannot conduct research and development (R&D) over the whole range of
scientific and technological fields. Therefore, the priority areas where
Russia can take competitive positions should be identified. The process
of priority setting should include an understanding of the key areas of
biotechnology development and the grand challenges that will form the
future shape of this sector and an analysis of available resources
including R&D capacity for particular thematic areas. To define
strategic directions for Russia's social, economic, scientific and
technological development in 2011-2013, a large-scale foresight study
(Russia 2030: Science and Technology Foresight) was undertaken (Ministry
of Education and Science of the Russian Federation; National Research
University Higher School of Economics, 2016). This article delves into
its results in the area of biotechnology as one of the seven priority
areas of science and technology (S&T) development. Methodology This
study represents the results of the third cycle of the national
foresight project. The first cycle was conducted in 2007-2008 and based
on results of a large-scale Delphi survey. Over time, the procedure of
prognosis projects in Russia has become more complicated and involved
more advanced methods. The third national foresight cycle integrated two
approaches: technology push (new knowledge and technologies drive the
launch of new products) and market pull (needs of society prompt S&T
development). According to these principles, on the one hand, grand
challenges that have the potential to dramatically transform the future
face of the economy, science and S&T sphere were identified. These grand
challenges were specified for particular priority areas, including
biotechnology. In turn, thematic trends determine the demand for
innovative products in the future. According to these results, a list of
promising markets, products and services was created. On the other hand,
the future technological supply was analyzed. Hereby, for every priority
area, a list of thematic fields, promising research areas and R&D topics
was formed. In addition, the selected areas were assessed according to
the Russian R&D level in comparison with the world. Also, centers of
excellence in Russia and abroad were identified. The methodology of the
project combines both qualitative and quantitative methods: expert
panels, horizon scanning, bibliometric and patent analysis, weak signals
and wild cards, SWOT analysis and stakeholder mapping. More than 2,000
experts from science, government and business were involved in the work,
including foreign specialists. They took part in different types of
expert activities: discussions, surveys, interviews, etc. The objective
foundation of the study was formed on the basis of bibliometric and
patent analysis and a review of more than 200 sources. Further, the
received results were used in the strategic decision-making process. For
example, a list of advanced R&D areas formed the basis for the state
program "R&D development" (The Russian Government, 2012) and other
strategic documents. Global trends in the development of biotechnologies
Until now, most of the biotechnological developments have been carried
out for biomedical and biopharmaceutical products (drugs, biocompatible
materials, biochips, diagnostic agents, etc). and to a lesser extent for
the food and agricultural sectors. Therefore, until now, medicine and
pharmaceuticals have been the main drivers in this area. However, new
technologies in this area can have a multiplicative effect and be
successfully used in other industrial sectors. A number of
socioeconomic, scientific and technological trends determine the
structure and operational principles of the national biotechnological
industry (Mikova and Sokolova, 2014). For several sectors, modernization
is possible only in the case of a transition to biotechnological methods
and products (e.g. the agro-food sector, the forestry sector and the
biomedical sector). According to the methodology of the project based on
literature analysis and expert studies, there were selected trends that
form the future of the biotech sector within or outside Russia. These
trends were evaluated according to their impact on Russia (strong/low
and positive/negative) and expected period of maximum effect (Figure 1).
New biotechnological products with advanced and new properties will help
to respond to the main global socioeconomic challenges that mankind will
face in the long and short term: population growth, aging, food
shortages, environmental degradation, climate change, the depletion of
hydrocarbon natural resources and others. The technological drivers are
not limited to progress in biology but also include developments in
nanotechnology and information and communication technology. Population
growth causes increased demand for food, pressure on the agricultural
sector and growing rates of fertile soil contamination and erosion. All
these problems can be addressed using biotechnological solutions. Along
with that, high-income consumers will request organic and functional
food. New bioproducts will help address the challenge of hidden hunger
(deficiency of vitamins and minerals), which includes an unbalanced diet
and a lack of essential vitamins and minerals. In the short and long
term, pervasive changes in the energy sector are expected. The depletion
of cheap supplies of hydrocarbons and the tightening of ecological
requirements will give an impetus to the development of renewable power
generation. Moreover, biogeotechnological methods to increase oil
recovery and remove unwanted admixtures from extracted minerals will be
in demand (Siegert et al., 2014). One of the most important global
challenges is the environmental degradation in many regions of the
world. The increasing human-induced burden on natural ecosystems is
associated with the emission of greenhouse and other harmful gases into
the atmosphere, land and water pollution and the depletion of sources of
drinking water and stocks of raw materials. The development of
biotechnologies will help to solve this problem, according to conception
of a circular economy, which involves the restoration of natural
resources (Pearce and Turner, 1989). A strong impetus for progress in
biotechnology will provide for the development of other scientific and
technological areas. New technologies to store, process and transfer big
data and supercomputing can be useful for genome, transcriptome and
proteome analysis, in metabolic engineering and bio-engineering. The
convergence of information and communications technology,
biotechnologies and nanotechnologies will have a significant impact on
the agricultural sector (Yashveer et al., 2014) and will lead to
development of "smart" agriculture (diagnostic agents, biosensors to
gauge growth, optimizing biodevices, biorobots, etc.). The adoption of
new technologies will raise the efficiency of use of agricultural land,
prevent erosion and the leaching of nutrients, maintain soil structure
and, as a whole, reduce the negative impact on the environment. Thus,
biotechnological development can help to find answers for the following
major global challenges: population growth and food shortages; crisis in
traditional sectors: substitution of chemical processes with
biotechnological ones; dependence on fossil fuels: development of
renewable bioenergy will contribute to the diversification of the energy
sector and reduce dependence on hydrocarbons; depletion of non-renewable
resources; and destruction of natural ecosystems as a result of human
activity: biotechnology can reduce the negative anthropogenic impact and
promote ecosystem restoration through the means of bioremediation. All
these global trends form windows of opportunity for the accelerated
development of biotechnologies. Many of them are significant for the
development of the Russian biotech sector, while some are not so
important (e.g. population growth, deficiency of fresh water and
depletion of fossil natural resources). In any case, all these trends
and challenges should be taken into account if Russia wants to
participate in global value chains. In parallel, the Russian biotech
sector faces a number of limitations and weaknesses specific to the
country: the critical lag in R&D and undeveloped production facilities;
low demand for practical developments in biotechnology; a powerful lobby
for the oil and gas sector; insufficient investment by businesses in
biotechnological industry infrastructure; high barriers to entry on
domestic and global biotechnology product markets; an ambiguous social
attitude toward the use of GMOs; and critical dependence on the
technological import in some sectors using biotechnology production
(Streltsova, 2014) (feed, enzymes, biomedical products and others). In
addition, nonmedical **[biotechnologies have]{.underline}** relatively
**[recently become a national priority in Russia]{.underline}**
(Technological Platform Bioindustry and Bioresources, 2015). In many
respects, it is connected with the significant reserves of gas and oil,
less attention to the environment than in developed countries and huge
areas of arable lands that promote extensive agriculture. However, the
availability of separate competitive scientific teams, a broad resource
base and large areas of arable land and forests are the windows of
opportunities for the development of this area in Russia. Progress in
biotechnology sector **[Biotechnology covers genetic
engineering]{.underline}**, cellular methods and technologies for the
creation and use of genetically modified biological objects for
production intensification or the creation of new kinds of products for
various purposes. Modern biotechnological processes are based on
recombinant **[DNA techniques]{.underline}**, as well as on the **[use
of]{.underline}** immobilized **[enzymes, cells]{.underline}** **[or
cell organelles. In Russia]{.underline}**, **[in the]{.underline}** near
**[future,]{.underline}** **[biotechnologies will be most in demand in
the]{.underline}** following **[markets]{.underline}**: industrial
bioproducts, biotechnological agricultural products, biofuel and
bioenergy, food industry, biological environmental protection systems,
biotechnological systems and products for the forestry sector and
aquaculture (Technological Platform Bioindustry and Bioresources, 2015).
In the light of progress in the field of biotechnology, the innovative
products with radical effects will be in demand on global markets.
Products with completely new properties or a multifold increase in
technical and economic properties should be developed to tackle the
challenges identified above. The most promising applications of
biotechnologies on these markets are given below. **[Russia has the
potential for the development of the biotech sector]{.underline}**,
although the level of R&D in the majority of areas is lagging behind
that in the USA and leading EU countries. However, **[there are several
advanced applied research areas where efforts can be
focused]{.underline}**. According to results of the study, the following
thematic areas of applied research have been identified: industrial
biotechnologies; energy biotechnologies; agricultural biotechnologies;
food biotechnologies; and environmental, forestry biotechnologies,
aquabioculture. Below these areas are described in more detail.
Industrial biotechnology Biotechnologies can successfully substitute
traditional chemical technologies and processes to produce biomaterials
and organic synthesis products with unique properties, including new
ones that do not exist in nature (National Research Council, (2015).
Replacing chemical production with biotechnological production will
create high-purity organic substances, including optically pure organic
compounds for the synthesis of drugs, and reduce the cost of its
production. New types of biomaterials owing to their special
characteristics will have a wide range of applications. Some of them
(e.g. bioplastics) will have valuable properties such as biodegradation,
and this, in turn, will give impetus to the development of new
biodegradable materials for medical and industrial applications. The
other way to produce biologically active compounds is the targeted
modification of the producing organism's biosynthetic pathways using
metabolic engineering techniques (Heux et al., 2015). These technologies
help to intensify the production of amino acids, vitamins, antibiotics,
enzymes, recombinant proteins and other products and are more efficient
than traditional ones (e.g. random mutagenesis) (Weber et al., 2015).
The most in-demand industrial bioproducts for long and short term are
fodder additives (essential amino acids, vitamins, protein), enzymes,
bioplastics, biopolymers and others. The industrial biotech sector
covers technologies for the production of industrial, agricultural and
medical products, both traditional (biologically active compounds,
recombinant proteins, forage, etc). and new ones (biopolymers, organic
synthesis products, biodegradable plastics, etc.), using biosynthetic
and biocatalytic processes, processes to obtain biomaterials, organic
synthesis products from renewable raw materials (primary lignocellulose
biomass and agricultural byproducts) and new technologies for the
production, isolation and purification of bioproducts and others
(National Research Council, 2015). The area of enzyme production for
industrial and agricultural applications, which are now mostly supplied
by foreign producers, will drive the development of the industrial
biotech area in the near future. The development of biotechnologies for
the raw material sector, such as microbial-enhanced oil recovery or
metal bioleaching, is also in demand by the industry right now.
Bioenergy The wide use of biofuels (including motor fuels) can transform
existing energy markets. New bioenergy technologies will help to save
non-renewable hydrocarbons, significantly expand the resource base of
the economy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and, as a result, reduce
the negative impact of energy on the planet's climate (Kilbane, 2016).
The main directions of bioenergy's technological development are
concerned with the improvement in energy efficiency, the
biotransformation of carbon dioxide into motor fuel, the reduction of
biofuel costs, the expansion of the supply base for its production and
the improvement of quality (stability, environmental cleanliness) (Hegde
et al., 2015). As Russia has practically unlimited natural oil and gas
resources, the development of the bioenergy sector will be initially
driven primary by global biofuel markets. Bioenergy development requires
new technologies, including the conversion of lignocellulosic materials
and agricultural waste into biofuels; environmentally friendly biomass
gasification technology and power generation units based on them; new
methods of producing high-quality motor fuels from CO2 without
photosynthesis; effective technologies of biogas production, including
highly efficient microorganisms; new technologies of production of
liquid motor fuels, including jet fuel, and components from vegetable
raw materials; new technologies of biomass processing into high-quality
solid fuel; and others. All these techniques are aimed at reducing
production costs and increasing the energy output ratio of biodiesel and
bioethanol. Agriculture Another sector where new promising
biotechnologies can be implemented in the near future is agriculture.
The Russian sector will continue to be an expensive one and lose in
competitiveness to other countries without the development and
introduction of biotechnological innovations. New varieties of crops and
breeds of livestock animals can be produced by using molecular
marker-assistant selection, doubled haploids technology, genetic
engineering, genome editing and other methods (Hartung and Schiemann,
2014). Next-generation varieties and hybrids will be notable for high
nutritional quality, high productivity (a larger size of fruit, reducing
ripening time, etc). and resistance to diseases and unfavorable weather
conditions (Yashveer et al., 2014; Rossi et al., 2015). New genomic
technologies will bring new and better breeds of farm animals (e.g.
those with the desired level of meat fatness) with rapid growth, which
will contribute to the rational use of feed. The development of
agrobiotechnologies will be also focused on advanced methods for
managing genetic resources of agricultural plants, animals and
microorganisms. The other promising direction includes innovative
biological techniques to protect plants and increase their productivity
and veterinary drugs. Agricultural biotechnologies are aimed at
increasing the efficiency of this sector and reducing crop losses
(Yashveer et al., 2014). Here R&D will concentrate on the development of
genetic markers for selection, symbiotic plant--microbial systems for
plant protection and growth stimulation, cloning techniques to replicate
outstanding farm animal genotypes, plant genetic engineering and a
methodology for the targeted modification of genomes ("genome editing"),
the creation of new breeds and others. The development of the seed
production industry within Russia is one of the highest priorities.
Scientific interests in the veterinary field will be focused on the
analysis of genomes of dangerous disease agents, studying the evolution
and channels for the spread of infectious agents and identifying and
studying mechanisms of resistance to pathogens. This knowledge can be
used in new technologies for producing new preventive and therapeutic
preparations based on research of the molecular mechanisms of
pathogenicity and immune response and developing new test systems for
high-performance detection of pathogens and recombinant vaccines against
animal infectious diseases. Food industry The growing market of organic
products will affect not only the agricultural sector but also the food
industry. The demand for "natural" food now prevails over the demand for
genetically modified food in Russia. The uptake of transgenic products
is limited owing to the ambiguous attitude of society and the state,
primarily because of the lack of objective information about its impact
on human health and the environment in the long term. A similar
situation occurs with the cultivation of test-tube meat (Verbeke et al.,
2015). This technology currently has a lot of limitations; however, in
the future, it has the potential to transform the sector of animal
husbandry and increase the output of finished meat products. Development
in this area may give a serious impetus for the creation of food and
industrial crops with improved or new properties and often at a lower
cost. As a result, one can expect a significant growth in agricultural
production. Plants and animals, including agricultural ones, can be used
also as biofactories to produce recombinant proteins for industrial
(enzymes, biopolymers, etc). and medical (vaccines, antibodies, enzymes)
use (Buyel, 2015). This technology is characterized by higher
effectiveness and fewer costs than traditional ones based on using cell
cultures from microorganisms or animals. The production of recombinant
proteins in plants using viral systems, as well as in the milk of
transgenic animals, can be noted as one of the most promising
developments. The most important competitive advantage of Russian
immunobiological drugs for veterinary practice is the use of local
strains of pathogenic microorganisms. It can provide higher specificity
for these products for their use in the Russian Federation and
neighboring countries. Safety evaluation systems for new and traditional
food sources, ingredients, food processing technologies, functional food
stuffs, baby food, diet and medical food, low allergenicity food and
biologically active additives will be in demand in the food industry in
the short and long term. Food biotechnologies will be developed in the
following areas: the integrated safety evaluation of products; food
protein technologies, including the targeted production of protein
compositions with specified properties and the deep conversion of
by-products and waste from processing vegetable and animal raw
materials; biotechnological approaches to the production of probiotics,
prebiotics, synbiotics, enzymes and food ingredients; and technologies
for processing food raw materials and waste. Environmental, forestry
biotechnologies, aquabioculture The use of biotechnologies for
environmental applications is focused on the creation of pollution
monitoring systems, the restoration of ecosystems using live organisms
-- bioremediators and protecting materials and technological objects
from biocorrosion. The methods of cleaning up oil spills are most in
demand. Today, bioremediation has been successfully used to protect soil
and groundwater and land reclamation. In the short and long term,
scientists will focus their efforts on the development of new verified
techniques for bio-testing and bioindication with increased sensitivity
and selectivity to detect environmental pollution; biotechnologies for
the purification of water, soil and air; and environmentally safe
biocides for protection of process facilities from
organisms-decomposers. Currently, not all technologies are commercially
effective, but the dynamics of the process suggest that over the next
10-15 years, they will be introduced into mass production. As in the USA
and EU (Häggman et al., 2013), forestry biotechnologies will be
concentrated on the creation of new varieties of arboreal plants with
improved properties (texture of timber, resistance to pathogens, growth
rate, etc.), microbiological protection of forests from pests and
pathogens and promising biotechnological processes for the integrated
processing of lignocellulose biomass and its individual components. At
the moment, the elimination of waste from woodworking enterprises in
Russia is practically undeveloped, as significant investments are
required for these purposes. There is a lack of capacities for deep
biotechnological processing of wood and equipment and technologies for
these purposes are missing. This sphere requires close attention from
the state. R&D in aquabioculture will be focused on the identification
of new biologically active substances from marine organisms, cultivating
cell lines of marine organisms, the producers of biologically active
compounds and molecular selection of the objects for industrial
aquaculture to make highly productive breeds (Reen et al., 2015). These
technologies correspond to the trend of the intensive development of
recirculating aquaculture systems. In the future, algae can become a
perspective source of biomass and be heavily used in the energy sector.
The development of the above-mentioned areas of applied research needs
new methodological approaches that can form the scientific and
methodological basis for biotechnology research. Progress in this
direction can be provided by new genomic and post-genomic technologies,
system, synthetic and structural biology, bioengineering and
bioinformatics. The research agenda should concentrate on bioinformatics
techniques to analyze genome, transcriptome and proteome data; the study
of the structure of macromolecules and their components and modeling
their structures in silico; metabolic engineering of microbial cells and
the development of models to create a synthetic cell; and other
promising techniques. Conclusion **[Russia has access to unique natural
resources]{.underline}**, **[including an unlimited supply of many types
of renewable raw materials and huge reserves of fresh water and fertile
land]{.underline}**, and **[therefore]{.underline}**, **[it has good
potential for biotechnological development]{.underline}** **[and
integration]{.underline}** into the global economy **[in this
sphere]{.underline}**. To ensure the long-term social development and
sustainability of the national economy, **[Russia should take a leading
position and create a competitive sector of the
bioeconomy]{.underline}**, which **[along with the
nanoindustry]{.underline}** and information technologies should be the
basis upon which the Russian economy is modernized. At present, Russia's
share in the global market of biotechnology products is by far less than
0.1 per cent, and for some segments, this share is near 0. That is why
there is a strong need for the development of the biotechnology industry
in the country and a need to enhance R&D activity in this area. The
concentration of available resources of the government and businesses on
the development of the biotechnological sector could help in the search
for answers to the challenges that Russia faces today or will face
tomorrow. It will help to pick up on the current level of research
activities, improve the quality of personnel training, make this area
the engine of the economy and carry out the so-called new
industrialization of the country, building a new, high-tech device
industry. The realization of the identified R&D priorities will require
the development of a detailed action plan, including the development of
biotechnological infrastructure, the large-scale launching of the
bioindustry in regions, the preservation and development of bioresource
potential and the improvement of the legal, economic, informational and
organizational bases.

Two events converged in 2012 that led us to conduct the project whose
findings are reported here. The basis for the first event was laid on
February 19, 2012, when the newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta published **[a
long article]{.underline}** authored **[by Prime Minister
Vladimir]{.underline}** Vladimirovich **[Putin]{.underline}** titled "A
Smart Defense Against New Threats."1 The article **[included
the]{.underline}** following **[passage]{.underline}**: What is the
future preparing for us? . . . **[In the more distant
future]{.underline}**, **[weapons systems based on new physical
principles]{.underline}** (**[beam, geophysical, wave, genetic,
psychophysical and other technology) will be developed]{.underline}**.
All this will, **[in ad- dition to nuclear]{.underline}** weapons,
provide entirely new instruments for achieving political and strategic
goals. Such hi-tech weapons systems will be compara- ble in effect to
nuclear weapons but will be more "acceptable" in terms of po- litical
and military ideology.2 As expected by most Russians and external
commentators, on March 4, 2012, Putin won the presidential election for
the second time. On March 22, 2012, he convened a ministerial meeting
"on the tasks he set in his articles as a presidential candidate."
Employing carefully vetted lan- guage, the future ministers took turns
explaining what their ministries would do to operationalize Putin's
electoral platform. In particular, the minister of defense, Anatoly
Serdyukov, explained to Putin how his Min- istry of Defense (MOD) would
match the contents of the aforementioned Rossiiskaya Gazeta article. He
stated: "Mr. Putin, we have thoroughly studied your article and prepared
a plan for implementing the tasks set there for **[the Defence
Ministry]{.underline}**."3 Serdyukov **[promised to
implement]{.underline}** twenty-eight tasks. Of these, the fourth task
was: "**[The development of weapons based on]{.underline}** new physical
principles: **[radiation, geophysical wave, genetic, psychophysical,
etc."]{.underline}**4 **[Commentators]{.underline}** in Russia and
abroad immediately picked up on Serdyukov's statement, some of whom
**[remarked that it was difficult to con- ceive of any "genetic" weapon
that would not violate the]{.underline}** Biological and Toxin Weapons
Convention (**[BWC]{.underline}**).5 These **[commentators
were]{.underline}** right to be **[alarmed]{.underline}**, **[given that
the]{.underline}** MOD's encyclopedia defines "**[genetic weapons" as "a
type of weapon able to damage the genetic (hereditary) apparatus of peo-
ple]{.underline}**. It is assumed/expected that some viruses can/may
serve as the active principle," and lists no other examples.6 Rather
than clarify what it had meant by this announcement, the Russian
government simply edited out the disquieting paragraph from the public
transcript of the meeting.7 The second event occurred just three months
after Putin was inaugu- rated president on May 7, 2012. In August 2012,
the US Department of State's yearly compliance report was issued and,
like its predecessors, it expressed concerns about Russia's possible
noncompliance with the BWC.8 As in the 2011 compliance report, the
Department of State averred that: "Available information during the
reporting period indicated Russian enti- ties have remained engaged in
dual-use, biological activities. It is unclear that these activities
were conducted for purposes inconsistent with the BWC. It also remains
unclear whether Russia has fulfilled its BWC obli- gations in regard to
the items specified in Article I of the Convention that it inherited."9
And as in previous reports, the Department of State noted that:
"Although Russia had inherited the past offensive program of biological
research and development from the Soviet Union, Russia's annual BWC
confidence-building measure declarations since 1992 have not
satisfactorily documented whether this program was completely destroyed
or diverted to peaceful purposes in accordance with Article II of the
BWC."10 Where all prior compliance reports had stated that the US
government had engaged Russia through bilateral and multilateral
discussions over these BWC com- pliance issues, this one was different.
The 2012 report's section on Russia's compliance with the BWC concluded
with the observation: "during the reporting period, no discussions took
place regarding Russia's compliance with the BWC."11 To us this meant
that the Putin and Obama administra- tions had stopped all bilateral
diplomatic efforts to address BWC-related issues the very year that
Putin and his minister of defense appeared to have promised to develop
genetic weapons. Our intent was to investigate as much as open sources
and interviews would allow the Putin administration's views on
biosciences and biotech- nology for civilian and military purposes, as
well as what activities it had launched in support of these fields.
**[Given the extensive legacy of the Soviet offensive biological
warfare]{.underline}** (BW) program **[and the well-resourced nature of
the Russian biodefense system]{.underline}** of the Putin and Medvedev
administra- tions, **[the reactivation of an illicit Russian BW program
would]{.underline}** mostly **[be]{.underline}** a question **[of
motivation]{.underline}**. It would require the acquisition of little to
no new capabilities or facilities that might be detected through
open-source research. We therefore had no illusion that our
investigation would unearth a Russian BW program even if such a program
had been launched. Rather, our objective was to discover and document
the dual-use activ- ities alluded to in the Department of State report,
and in doing so move the discussion over Russian compliance concerns to
the public sphere, where issues could be at least partly evaluated on
the basis of evidence rather than wholly on the basis of trust in either
US or Russian official statements. We were concerned by our discovery of
a buildup and modernization of the Russian biodefense establishment
under the Putin administration that had gone publicly unreported in
English-language sources, including in Depart- ment of State compliance
reports. We sought to draw attention to this development and to
highlight specific activities of concern. Concerns left to fester with
no diplomatic recourse can rapidly devolve into paranoia. Russia is home
to some of the world's brightest civilian experts on dangerous
infectious disease. It is in the world's interest that their already
underused research be openly applied to benefit the public health
sector. If US-Russian relations on BWC issues continue to deterio- rate,
their research instead risks languishing because of the twin effects of
Russian publication controls and travel restrictions, and a US
unwillingness to fund research and invest in joint ventures. For that
reason, while we focus on Russian activities that we deem are of
concern, we also propose certain steps that Russia could realistically
take to improve transparency or decrease diplomatic brinksmanship
without losing face. In addition, we devote a considerable number of
pages to analyzing the state of Russia's civilian life sciences research
and commercial biotechnology sectors, with an emphasis on specific
programs that have in the past involved coopera- tion or co-publication
with the West. Our hope is that the findings reported here will help the
US govern- ment to reengage with their Russian counterparts on
BWC-related compli- ance issues without having to reveal US intelligence
sources and methods. We also wish to foster greater interest on the part
of BWC States Parties generally, as well as nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) and the public at large in BW involved in
interdiction efforts, because their renewed engagement and pressure on
this topic is a necessary precondition for diplo- matic progress on the
current issue and more generally for the BWC's effective functioning in
the future. At the same time, doctrinal pronouncements tend to be vague
by design, and dual-use activities by definition lack a unique plausible
expla- nation. We wanted our readers to be able to view the same
evidence as we have discovered and derive value from our work regardless
of whether they agreed with our interpretations. We therefore took a
facts-heavy approach when reporting what we had found in the hopes that
this work's numerous lists, figures, charts, and translated quotes will
at a minimum serve as a useful reference for anyone interested in
BW-related security in general as well as those who follow Russian
developments.

of both strategic and tactical nuclear capabilities as well as related
delivery systems and supporting infrastructure. This old tool has been
accompanied by doctrinal revisions that have elevated the role of
nuclear weapons, including in Russia's innovation strategy. Russia began
to counter numerous U.S. and Chinese technological initiatives using

ARE U.S. ADVERSARIES ENHANCING HUMANS FOR WAR? Former **[U.S. Deputy
Secretary of Defense]{.underline}** Bob Work has **[made it clear that
our adversaries]{.underline}** \"**[are pursuing enhanced human
operations]{.underline}**, and \[that\] it scares the crap out of
us.\"\[32\] **[He has also stated that \"\[a\]ltering human beings from
the inside to more effectively fight in combat presents ethical dilemmas
for American scientists and military planners]{.underline}**.\"\[33\]
Indeed, the U.S. may never want to pursue some types of human
enhancement. But it nevertheless must be prepared to deal with
adversaries who have no similar compunctions about moving ahead in this
realm. **[Russia is a case in point]{.underline}**. **[One need look no
further than the country\'s civilian sector to see how lax the Russian
government truly is about human enhancement initiatives.]{.underline}**
**[The use of performance-enhancing drugs by Russian Olympic
athletes]{.underline}** before and during the 2012 Games **[was
well-known, state sanctioned and institutionally abetted by the Russian
government.\[]{.underline}**34\] The implications are ominous; concrete
evidence of human enhancement in the Russian military is not readily
available, but **[if the Kremlin is covertly providing
performance-enhancing drugs to the country\'s athletes it is reasonable
to conclude that it is doing far more for its warfighters. There is more
overt evidence of human enhancement in China]{.underline}**. Genetic
enhancements are known to have been conducted on dogs and, as mentioned
above, **[Chinese scientists have already experimented with gene editing
on human embryos]{.underline}** for health applications. Reportedly in
their efforts to combat human diseases including Parkinson\'s and
muscular dystrophy, **[researchers in China have successfully suppressed
the myostatin gene, which regulates muscle growth in both dogs and
humans]{.underline}**. In experiments with the embryos of two beagles,
the dogs were born with significantly increased muscle mass.\[35\] As a
thought experiment, imagine that an adversary finds a way to engineer
soldiers with increased cognitive abilities that provide them with a
material advantage on the battlefield. If the U.S. were to ignore such
developments, by the time this new generation of soldiers demonstrated
its true prowess as adults, we could find ourselves two decades behind
the development curve.\[36\] PREPARING FOR AN ENHANCED FUTURE **[The
potential for human enhancement is immeasurable]{.underline}**. However,
**[ethical considerations will need to be weighed when the U.S. military
evaluates which forms of enhancements to pursue. The Department of
Defense has]{.underline}** demonstrated a propensity to **[fund research
that enhances humans through exoskeletons and human machine
interfaces]{.underline}**, and it should continue to fund such worthy
initiatives. However, the **[hesitancy now visible within the U.S.
military to pursue some of the more low-tech forms of biological human
enhancements is less advisable]{.underline}**. A concerted effort should
be made to pursue research on subjects such as performance-enhancing
drugs, cognitive enhancements and bio-technology that hold the potential
to increase the operational effectiveness of the military. **[As for
genetic modification, the U.S. military has wisely steered clear of
eugenics to date. However, some of America\'s adversaries might not
prove to be so scrupulous]{.underline}**. As a result, the U.S. military
needs to begin planning now to counter such initiatives. If it does not,
we may wake up two decades hence wholly unprepared for the battlefield
of the future.

[Warfare is]{.underline} a [rapidly changing]{.underline} front,
[evolving as tech]{.underline}nology [grows]{.underline}. It has seen
many advancements throughout history, ranging from ground combat, the
use of long-range firearms, the introduction of airpower, and the
development of long-range missiles. Most weapons, when designed and
constructed, aim to limit daily human activity and infiltrates the state
economic and governmental elements. [The effect of a modern bioweapon
containing a deadly disease is enough to **eradicate security measures**
and **disarm entire regions**]{.underline}. However, what would happen
if scientists were able to meld technology with naturally occurring
biological agents and tweak a granular detail in a human's molecular
composition to prevent disease? Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) is a gene-editing technology that has
demonstrated the capability to perform molecular modification.
CRISPR-Cas9 acts as a pair of genetic scissors, coded to enter a
specific area of an organism's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and adds,
removes, or changes genes. When different genes are present, an
organism's traits can express altered reactions to the environment. This
may appear to be a useful apparatus: something to assist in limb growth,
prevent HIV, increase brain development, or slow tumor growth. However,
while researchers look at these ideas, a genetic ' gorilla looms in the
background. **[Gene editing]{.underline}** of humans and animals [could
take place to improve physical and mental performance, yet it **poses
immense risks** to human and international security]{.underline}. This
research pursues increased resistance to certain diseases, while at the
same time, [edits to genes contained in harmful viruses could make them
**more dangerous**]{.underline}. With these developments, [human and
state security are called into question, as is the condition of
i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations. Historical Context
of Biological Warfare Biological warfare itself is not a new concept. As
early as 1155, weaponized poisons killed enemies and civilians. The
development of biological weapons took a new path in World War I from
the German Army. Attacks at this point were considered small-scale, with
the use of smallpox and glanders to infect people and animals.
Undetectable by the naked eye and deadly, these weapons sparked a
security dilemma between countries and created a race to develop and
test biological weapons. As there were no peace treaties or disarmament
efforts in effect---World War I ended prior to the 1925 United Nations
Conference prohibiting the use of chemical and biological weapons in
war---countries were left unchecked to begin experiments. In 1939, Japan
acquired a strain of yellow fever virus from the Rockefeller Institute
and used it as a weapon against China. Though this example of biological
warfare was singular to WWII, it still poses a significant stressor to
international relations between Japan and China. The lasting effect
weighs heavily on international relations with Eastern nations today as
trade deals and information exchange tests the trust between
participating countries. The US started its development of biological
weapons around 1941 to counter Japanese efforts. Domestic research
studied the effects of different microbes on volunteers, animals, and
unsuspecting civilians. Studies took place in crowded areas, like subway
stations in New York City and boats off the coasts of Virginia and San
Francisco. Researchers tested non-lethal viruses at approximately 200
different sites where people commonly traveled. Though these kinds of
tests violate today's Institutional Review Board processes, no such
rules or oversight of research existed during World War II and the
post-war period. This testing and development make biological warfare
highly questionable, considering its relation to human security and
history. There is a thin line delineating between testing and abuse.
Without a well-defined boundary between the two, the effects of
biological weapons include mass deaths, sickness, and decreases in
resources to threatened populations. This seemingly invisible armament
poses a significant threat as most responses are reactive when it comes
to combating diseases or other biological events. Any country releasing
a biological weapon will automatically have an advantage over the target
population. OTH, Emerging Security Environment, Multi-Domain Operations
Perceptions labeling biological weapons as the poor man's nuclear bomb
and protests against the Vietnam War led the Nixon Administration to end
the biological warfare development program in 1969. Efforts turned to
the American nuclear arsenal rather than weaponizing botulinum toxin and
Staphylococcus enterotoxin B. American efforts to end biological
research led to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) of
1972 which revamped the protocols of the 1925 Geneva ruling on
biological and chemical weapons. Under the BTWC, participating states
must provide annual reports detailing activities relating to biological
research, development, laboratory and research centers, and vaccine
production. A final resolution, adopted in 2006, established an
Implemental Support Unit to provide states assistance in participation
and adherence to the BTWC. The intent behind the BTWC was to create
greater transparency concerning biological developments. Unsurprisingly,
the Soviet Union began its own biological trials after signing the BTWC
with the installment of their program Biopreparat in 1970. Knowing the
nature of Biopreparat was in violation of the BTWC, the program was
hidden behind a façade of civilian biotechnology and pharmaceutical
developments located in biological weapons facilities formerly used by
the Ministry of Defense and new facilities dispersed in closed cities
across the Soviet Union. From the 1970s onward, the Soviet Union
collected anthrax, smallpox, plague, and fever viruses to produce
drug-resistant strains. From its inception to its 1989 public exposure,
defectors from the program provided staggering amounts of information
regarding Russian activities and the growing bioweapon arsenal. However,
the true extent of Biopreparat far surpassed the expectations of Western
intelligence agencies when revelations came to light after the collapse
of the USSR. Contemporary Biological Warfare Concerns Biological warfare
has centered on viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens to disrupt the
neuropathways of humans and animals. However, the editing of such
organisms down to a specific gene has opened a new realm of
possibilities. Recent advances in technology and an expansion of access
to these technologies has shifted biological warfare towards a new
direction with alarming implications. [Chinese research and
experimentation with gene-editing software place them at the **forefront
of biological knowledge** and tech]{.underline}nology
[development]{.underline}. As one of the cheapest gene editing
technologies, CRISPR-Cas9 is an easy tool to utilize across a myriad of
experiments and simplifies integration into studies of human capability.
The [tech]{.underline}nology [allows an individual an easy path to
**reconstruct a pathogen** or other deadly biological
component]{.underline} (e.g., Spanish Flu or Ebola viruses). The tools
and techniques are relatively easy to obtain, though [Chinese mastery of
the method has quickly **surpassed**]{.underline} that of [other
nations]{.underline}. In their "Thirteenth Five-Year Plan" released in
2016, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) outlined the importance of
civilian-military fusion with genetic research at the forefront of that
symbiotic relationship. This relationship marked an immense step for
China's biological development, with scientists advancing research in
human-performance enhancement. This access gained by China and the PLA
is worrisome as these same scientists now have the liberty to extend
beyond current external factors and advance inwards to the biological
composition of an organism. The capabilities of CRISPR-Cas9 have
tremendous potential for Chinese military deterrence, which would also
affect international relations with countries all over the globe,
possibly triggering a second arms race towards biological weapons. [More
troublesome are China's recent developmental expansions beyond their own
borders]{.underline}. The National Genebank used to collect and maintain
the most extensive library of human genes in the world has been
identified as an internal security tool and is utilized to develop
China's resources. China maintains partnerships with companies and
universities all over the world---including the US, specifically the
University of California -- Davis and the Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia---and have given China access to an unfathomable amount of
information. This amassed data threatens both human and state security
because as more information is collected, the resources China can tap
into increase. As Eric Croddy argues in The Nonproliferation Review,
[China sees the US as a hegemonic power, using that power to keep other
countries at a disadvantage, even in such areas considering
**bio-warfare**]{.underline}. As a result, [the two countries have
remained tense concerning diplomatic and militaristic
matters]{.underline}. [Access to information like this exceeds what
China has previously sought: binary personal identifying information.
Never have they requested physical, living information, to include blood
samples, facial scans, and fingerprints]{.underline}. [With China's
drive to obtain biological dominance]{.underline}, much like countries
today strive for land, air, sea, and space superiority, **[it becomes
imperative the US can respond effectively]{.underline}**. This response
must include resources to combat further human infection, economic
decline, and decreases in defense capabilities. China instituted new
regulations to curb the abuse of this research. Gene editing became a
part of fundamental human rights---including embryonic rights---as a
last-minute addition to their 2019 protocol. On paper, the inclusion of
gene editing with human and embryonic rights ensures an individuals'
physical well-being, dignity, freedom, and privacy. Additional drafted
regulations require granted approval before any experiments are made on
genomes. Other procedures calling for authorization from China's
National Health Commission include gene modification (beyond CRISPR),
stem-cell technologies, mitochondrial replacement, and other proposals
with unpredictable and possibly dangerous outcomes. Proposed punishments
for disregarding this regulation and the respective national laws could
include cancellation of future grant applications, blacklisting, and
criminal charges. However, actual enforcement is questionable, as much
of the research is state-sponsored by the PLA. Additionally, China has a
rough past when it comes to human rights behaviors and treatment. Just
as the West was unaware of the scope of the Soviet Biopreparat
apparatus, it is nearly impossible to understand the full extent of
Chinese biological development. Ambiguity is one of the most striking
dilemmas of biowarfare development. When combining human factors with
state and international elements, any assault to Chinese structures
holds deadly consequences to foreign governments and economies. China's
behavior towards external sources has thus far been amicable in its
acquisition of genetic information from its international research
partners. However, China has forced the collection of additional data
from its indigenous Uighur population, creating a genetic version of Mao
Zedong's Hundred Flowers Movement. History demonstrates the extent of
harm provoked by forced compliance; not only is the collection a
violation of the individual, but it also attacks their community. As
China continues in their unyielding pursuit of information power and
dominance, the effect of it all remains largely unknown. [Biological
warfare through the process of gene editing is no longer like chemical
warfare. It is a newly developing field and contains immense
possibilities where a biological, gene-edited weapon could **pose a
massive threat** to vast numbers of people]{.underline}. However, what
sets [gene editing]{.underline} apart from any other weapon is that only
the individual who physically used CRISPR to edit specific genes knows
the extent those genes were affected; they are the sole keeper of the
new genetic code. This [**makes it incredibly difficult** for the
targeted population to produce a viable vaccine to counter whatever
effect the edit caused]{.underline}, posing a 21st century Enigma
machine to countries around the world. That [scenario calls to question
the overarching security of nations around the world. Such "**invisible
battlefields**" have the potential to become more and more prominent and
add to the confusion of international conflict and the community's
position on gene editing. A country would **lose all warfighting
capabilities** from exposure to an undetectable enemy **before they
could find a solution**.]{.underline} China is the leading developer and
researcher of biowarfare, and their technologies are outstripping that
of other global powers. [**Left unchecked**, **China** poses an
**incredible threat** to the **current balance of power** with newly
developed **gene**tic **weapons**]{.underline}. Technological advances
have enabled China's experiments to search out new, evolving ideas.
Chinese researchers revealed that they edited the genes of some police
dogs by removing the gene connected to myostatin production. Myostatin
inhibits myogenesis, which is muscle growth and differentiation. Once
the gene is modified or deleted, muscles reproduce and build at a much
faster rate than typical, which is ideal for hunting, running, and
high-intensity tasks. These dogs can then breed future litters that lack
the same myostatin gene. Because dogs share similar anatomy to humans,
the effects could be analyzed and applied to human gene modification.
[With this]{.underline} kind of [tech]{.underline}nological
[advancement]{.underline} and a willingness to use it in a military
context, [geneticists could create a **new breed of
soldier**]{.underline}. American relations with China remain complex.
[International efforts to control and reduce arms have not addressed
Chinese developments in genetics]{.underline}. The National Biodefense
Strategy fails to address US biological response capabilities, nor is
there any mention of gene editing itself. There are also minimal
resources for what steps America would take defensively or offensively
should a genetic war take place. Given the pace of today's biowarfare
development, Chinese research has outpaced all counter-biological
strategies. While the issues of biological-genetic warfare present a new
field of study, American defense officials have done little to prepare
for a worst-case scenario. [The **US focus must temper Chinese efforts**
that currently expand tech]{.underline}nologies [associated with
biological warfare and **gene editing**]{.underline}. Rather than be
reactionary, the US must engage with other countries and join efforts to
enforce the standards of the BTWC. The US is at a disadvantage and will
remain so unless it is able and willing to match China's development.
The Nixon administration's closure of biological research programs also
led to the atrophy of any American ability to keep pace with
advancements in genetic warfare. Disarmament treaties and research bans
are unlikely to sway Chinese efforts to advance the field. Moreover,
while biological warfare held little sway in twentieth century political
and military reactions, today's efforts require more careful attention
in the implementation of these advances. Greater international
involvement is a must, especially from the BTWC signatory states.
[**Without international resolve**, gene-edited bioweapons will
undoubtedly **transition** in**to multiple combat platforms**. **The US
needs to garner the support of other countries** to ensure China remains
within an acceptable realm of genetic research]{.underline}. [**The
international community must establish clear limits to gene editing**
and genetic modification. The rapid development of technology in today's
combat environments negatively affects i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elations. [If **gene**tic **engineering** is introduced
into humans and **placed in combat**, **tensions** will **undoubtedly
escalate**]{.underline}. Technological advances are unavoidable in
today's national and global stages; thus, the US and other countries
must respond effectively.

Genome editing technologies have led to fundamental changes in genetic
science. Among them, CRISPR-Cas9 technology particularly stands out due
to its advantages such as easy handling, high accuracy, and low cost. It
has made a quick introduction in fields related to humans, animals, and
the environment, while raising difficult questions, applications,
concerns, and bioethical issues to be discussed. [Most concerns stem
from the use of CRISPR-Cas9 to genetically **alter human germline cells
and embryos** (called germline genome editing). Germline genome editing
leads to **serial bioethical issues**, such as the occurrence of
undesirable changes in the genome, from whom and how informed consent is
obtained, and the breeding of the human species (eugenics).]{.underline}
However, the bioethical issues that CRISPR-Cas9 technology could cause
in the environment, agriculture and livestock should also not be
forgotten. In order for CRISPR-Cas9 to be used safely in all areas and
to solve potential issues, worldwide legislation should be prepared,
taking into account the opinions of both life and social scientists,
policy makers, and all other stakeholders of the sectors, and
CRISPR-Cas9 applications should be implemented according to such
legislations. However, these controls should not restrict scientific
freedom. Here, various applications of CRISPR-Cas9 technology,
especially in medicine and agriculture, are described and ethical issues
related to genome editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology are discussed.
The social and bioethical concerns in relation to human beings, other
organisms, and the environment are addressed. Keywords: Genome editing,

Introduction For many years, molecular biologists have sought ways to
use cellular repair mechanisms to manipulate DNA through genome editing.
In this way, they would have the power to change the genome by
correcting a mutation or introducing a new function (Rodriguez, 2016).
For this purpose, genome editing technologies were developed (Memi et
al., 2018). In recent years, clustered regularly interspaced short
palindromic repeats technology (CRISPR-Cas9) has become the most
preferred method of gene editing. This technology has advantages such as
high accuracy, easy handling, and relatively low cost compared to
previous technologies, such as zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) and
transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN). Thanks to these
benefits, CRISPR-Cas9 technology can be easily applied in any molecular
biology laboratory. Genome editing technologies are used in the
formation of human disease models in experimental animals and for the
understanding of basic gene functions. They also have great therapeutic
potential for future treatment of untreated diseases such as certain
cancers, genetic disorders, and HIV/AIDS. Today, genome editing in
somatic cells is one of the promising areas of therapeutic development
(Otieno, 2015). However, various bioethical issues have arisen due to
the potential impact of these technologies on the safety of food stocks
and clinical applications (Hundleby and Harwood, 2018; Hirch et al.,
2019). This review discusses the challenges, possible consequences, and
bioethical issues of CRISPR-Cas9 in detail. Go to: 2. Biology and
function of CRISPR-Cas9 technology Genome editing technologies often
work by creating fractures in chromosomal DNA. ZFN, TALEN, and
CRISPR-Cas9 are all based solely on nucleases (Kim and Kim, 2014; Roh et
al., 2018). The strength of these technologies stems from the ability to
create fractures in the desired region of a specific target sequence as
determined by the researcher. This allows researchers to modify the
genome in practice in any region (Memi et al., 2018). The creation of
changes in the genome depends mainly on the DNA repair capacity of the
cells (Lau et al., 2018). All cells have two basic mechanisms for the
repair of double chain breaks on DNA. One of them is nonhomologous end
joining (NHEJ) and the other is the homologous dependent repair (HDR)
mechanism. In NHEJ, the ends of the fractures are quickly connected
directly to each other, regardless of the sequence homology, while HDR
requires homology to repair the damaged DNA site. In order to achieve
homology, the undamaged sister chromatid is used as a template and DNA
damage is repaired (Urnov, 2018). CRISPR-Cas9 is a naturally occurring
defense system in prokaryotic organisms that provides resistance to
foreign genetic elements such as plasmids and bacteriophages (Barrangau
et al., 2007; Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2008). When the virus or
plasmid enters a bacterial cell, CRISPR-Cas9 allows the addition of
short viral DNA molecules to the CRISPR site. CRISPR sequences (CRISPRs)
are short DNA repeats of viral or plasmid origin found in the genomes of
bacteria and are defined as clustered regularly interspaced short
palindromic repeats. Cas genes (CRISPR-related) are genes that encode
nuclease or helicase proteins associated with CRISPR repeat sequences
that have the function of cutting or dissolving DNA (Jansen et al.,
2002). Cas9, a member of the Cas gene family, was isolated from
Streptococcus pyogenes and is an endonuclease capable of cutting DNA
from two active cut regions at both ends of the DNA double helix (Doudna
and Charpentier, 2014; Rodriguez, 2016). The CRISPR-Cas system
recognizes the DNA of the invading virus or bacterium and directs the
Cas protein to destroy foreign DNA (Otieno, 2015). In the following
years, it was discovered that the CRISPR-Cas system can be programmed to
find and cut specific target DNA regions, thereby providing genome
editing (Jinek et al., 2012; Hsu et al., 2013). As a result of
understanding that the human genome can be edited by CRISPR-Cas9, it
became clear that genome editing could also be used for therapeutic
purposes, and a new era in genetic engineering began (Lau et al., 2018;
Roh et al., 2018). Go to: 3. Application areas 3.1. Animal models
CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to create animal models to mimic human diseases
and to understand disease development by mutating or silencing genes. A
mouse model has been developed to determine the harmful effects of
mutations in cancer by making mutations that cause the loss of function
in tumor suppressor genes or give functions to protooncogenes (Chin,
2015). Conventional genetically modified (GM) mouse models are produced
by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells or transgenesis, which are
time-consuming and highly expensive. With CRISPR-Cas9, GM mice can be
efficiently produced in a much shorter time (Mei et al., 2016). It can
be applied to nonhuman primates such as monkeys. Nonhuman primates are
more similar to humans in anatomical, physiological, and genetic terms
than rodents (Zhang et al., 2014). Therefore, they are more suitable
models than rodents in understanding human biology and disease
development (Xin et al., 2016). The first successful application of
CRISPR-Cas9 in nonhuman primates, from which a knockout monkey was
produced, was realized in 2014 (Niu et al., 2014). However, genome
sequences of many nonhuman primates are not yet fully identified. This
makes it difficult to design selected single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) (Gou
and Li, 2015; Lou et al., 2016). Therefore, the application of
CRISPR-Cas9 in nonhuman primates is still at an early stage. 3.2. Genome
editing in specific tissues Researchers have been able to modify the
genomes of specific tissues such as liver and brain tissues using
hydrodynamic injection and adeno-associated virus (AAV) (Rodriguez et
al., 2014; Senis et al., 2014). In a study, CRISPR-Cas9 has been
successfully and effectively applied to the mammalian nervous system. A
mixture of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled AAV-spCas9 and
AAV-spGuide plasmids was transferred in vivo to the hippocampal toothed
brain folds of adult male mice (Swiech et al., 2015). It is thought that
the number of such applications will grow in the fields of cancer and
neuroscience in the following years (Mei et al., 2016). 3.3. Multiple
gene mutations CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to generate mutants for target
genes. In the first such study by Li et al., six sgRNAs targeting Cas9
mRNA and six different genomic regions encoding the Tet1, Tet2, and Tet3
genes were transferred to the cytoplasm of rat embryos (Li et al.,
2013). Findings showed that all three Tet genes carried the desired
mutations in 59% of newborn rat pups. Successful results were also
reported in studies with zebrafish embryos and Arabidopsis as well (Ota
et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). 3.4. Epigenome studies Epigenome
studies can be performed in two different ways: genome or epigenome
editing (Chen et al., 2014; Huisman et al., 2015). In genome editing,
nuclease is used to modify the DNA sequence, whereas in epigenome
editing, an effector domain is used and the DNA sequence is not changed.
This function is achieved by catalytic inactivation of the
Cas9-associated effector domain by replacing the Cas9 protein. Altered
effector proteins are used to activate or suppress transcription (Lau
and Davie, 2016). In epigenome editing, the epigenome can be modified by
changing the proteins that maintain and protect the epigenome.
Suppression of DNA methylation as a result of degradation of catalytic
domains that accelerate the loss of spherical DNA methylation in human
cells and lead to cell death is a good example of epigenome studies
using CRISPR-Cas9 (Liao et al., 2015). Another application is the
editing of long nonencoded RNAs (lncRNAs) and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) that
can control gene expression and epigenome processes. In a study,
eRNA-expression factors and IncRNA-expression enhancers were suppressed
by stimulating deletion mutations in a lymphoma cell line using
CRISPR-Cas9 (Pefanis et al., 2015). It is predicted that CRISPR-Cas9 may
allow different levels of epigenome modification and facilitate further
changes to humans (Liao et al., 2015; Mei et al., 2016). 3.5. Treatment
of diseases CRISPR-Cas9 can be applied to cells in vivo or ex vivo. In
the in vivo approach, CRISPR-Cas9 is directly transferred to cells in
the body using either viral or nonviral methods. In the ex vivo
approach, first the cells are removed from the body; then CRISPR is
applied to the cells and they are transferred back to the body (Roh et
al., 2018). This approach has great potential to develop tissue-based
therapies (Rath et al., 2015). Using CRISPR-Cas9, the mutation in the
dystrophin protein responsible for the most common form of Duchenne
muscular dystrophy was successfully removed (Amoasii et al., 2018;
Duchêne et al., 2018; Koo et al., 2018; Long et al., 2018). There are
studies to prevent and treat AIDS by inhibiting the entry of HIV into
the cell or by removing the HIV genome integrated into the host genome
using CRISPR-Cas9 (Saayman et al., 2015). Induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) were successfully produced from cystic fibrosis patients with
confirmed F508 deletion in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator
(CFTR) gene by CRISPR-Cas9 (Firth et al., 2015). There are also studies
for cataracts (Wu et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016) and Parkinson's
disease (Yang et al., 2016). However, recent studies have shown that
CRISPR-Cas9 activates the type 1 interferon (INF) pathway, causing a
type 1 INF-mediated immune response (Kim et al., 2018; Charleswort et
al., 2019). These findings currently limit the use of CRISPR-Cas9 in
treatment. 3.6. Industrial uses CRISPR was first used for commercial
purposes to make bacterial cultures used in cheese and yogurt production
resistant to viral infections (van Erp et al., 2015). One of the
applications in agriculture is to produce GM crops (Hundleby and
Harwood, 2019). There are attempts to increase the yield in the
livestock industry (van Erp et al., 2015). It can be used to control
invasive pest species to reverse pesticide and herbicide resistance in
insects and weeds or to prevent disease spread (Esvelt et al., 2014).
Researchers have succeeded in preventing the spread of genes protecting
mosquitoes from harmful malaria parasites (Gantz et al., 2015) and
making female mosquitoes infertile in the laboratory (Hammond et al.,
2016). Vaccine development is another significant area of interest. The
smallpox virus vector (VACV) is used in the eradication and vaccination
of smallpox. Using CRISPR-Cas9, the efficiency of marker-free VACV
vectors has been increased (Yuan et al., 2015). Another example is the
hepatitis B vaccine. In order to prevent viral gene expression and
replication, specific regions of the hepatitis B genome were targeted
and cut by CRISPR-Cas9 (Ramanan et al., 2015). 3.7. RNA editing
Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) sequences can also be edited by CRISPR-Cas9.
In RNA editing, CRISPR-Cas9 consists of a DNA oligonucleotide presenting
the PAM (protospacer adjacent motif) region (PAMmer), ssRNA, guide RNA
(gRNA), and Cas9 protein. PAMmer acts as a PAM region specifically
recognized by Cas9 and directs Cas9 to bind and cut the target ssRNA.
5'-Elongated PAMmers containing bases paired with different ssRNAs and
immediately in front of PAM are required for specific binding of target
ssRNAs. Since RNA molecules have different functions than DNA,
CRISPR-Cas9 can offer a much more flexible application than other genome
editing methods (Mei et al., 2016). 3.8. Military applications [One of
the lesser-discussed application areas of CRISPR-Cas9 technology is
**its use for military purposes.** As is known, a substantial portion of
genome editing studies are supported by the defense ministries of the
countries. These studies are commonly focused on **increasing the
tolerance of soldiers** against biological or chemical warfare. This
technology has the potential to influence human performance
optimization]{.underline} (Greene and Master, 2018). Studies are usually
concentrated on discovering different genes that can be harnessed from
other species (Gracheva et al., 2010) and identifying new genes that can
be associated with posttraumatic stress disorder, which is frequently
experienced by soldiers (Cornelis et al., 2010). In a study by Zou et
al. (2015), researchers developed dog embryos with higher muscle mass
using CRISPR-Cas9. Another interesting study showed that [**the CMG2
gene**, known to cause low sensitivity to anthrax toxin when expressed
in small amounts, **could be silenced by this technology**]{.underline}
(Arévalo et al., 2014). However, it should be noted that far more
research needs to be conducted for using CRISPR technology in humans as
a defense tool against biological and chemical weapons (Greene and
Master, 2018). 3.9. DNA replacement in human embryos (germline genome
therapy) [The most controversial usage of CRISPR-Cas9 is the
modification of human embryo DNA, or, in other words, its use for
**germline genome therapy**. In 2015, a group of **Chinese researchers**
led by Junjiu Huang applied CRISPR-Cas9 to remove a mutation that causes
β-thalassemia, which is a fatal blood disease, from the human β-globulin
(HBB) gene in the germline of human embryos.]{.underline} In this
research, six abnormal embryos not suitable for in vitro fertilization
were used. The mutation could be corrected in only one of the embryos.
[Although the mutation could be corrected in two other embryos,
**nontarget effects occurred in other genes**. In the other three
embryos, the mutation could not be corrected. It has been reported that
this technique is not ready for clinical use because of nontarget
effects on different genes]{.underline} (Roh et al., 2018; Carroll,
2019). Modifications that occur in germline cells can be transferred to
future generations. Scientists think that they can extract genes that
cause diseases in the population using CRISPR-Cas9 (Cai et al., 2018;
Memi et al., 2018). Go to: 4. Bioethical issues The fact that
CRISPR-Cas9 is among the important discoveries of the 21st century is
widely accepted in the scientific community and related industries.
[However, the rapid rise of CRISPR-Cas9 has led to new bioethical,
social, and legal issues in medicine, agriculture, livestock, and the
environment.]{.underline} Possible risks and bioethical issues related
to CRISPR-Cas9 are summarized in the Table.

### 2AC -- China Revisionist

#### China is revisionist

professor of global affairs at Johns Hopkins University's School of
Advanced International Studies. Foreign Policy, \"The Dangers of
China\'s Decline as a Great
Power\", 4/14/2022, https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/14/china-decline-dangers/, accessed

[Decline is a tricky concept]{.underline}. [The term makes us think of a
country that is falling like a rock---one whose power and capabilities
are dropping across the board.]{.underline} But [a country can be in
relative]{.underline} [decline]{.underline} vis-à-vis a fast-growing
adversary [even if its own power is still increasing]{.underline}. [It
can be surging forward in]{.underline} some areas, such as [military
might, even as its underlying economic strength starts to
wither]{.underline}. And decline doesn't always lead a country to scale
back its objectives---[the sense of urgency]{.underline} it creates [can
cause ambitious powers to **grab what they can before the clock runs
out.**]{.underline} Xi Jinping's China is about to give the world an
education in the nuances of decline. Since the onset of its economic
reforms in the 1970s, [China has long defied predictions that it would
soon stumble or collapse]{.underline}. Its [spectacular growth
challenged prevailing views]{.underline} about the sources of national
success in the modern world. In some ways, [China is still soaring: Its
military power grows more formidable every year]{.underline}. When Xi
declares that "[the East is rising and the West is
declining]{.underline}," he gives voice to this sense that China is a
country on the make. Yet [military power is often a lagging indicator of
a country's trajectory]{.underline}: [It takes time]{.underline} to turn
money into military muscle, [and massive buildups often persist even
after]{.underline} a [country's economic fortunes begin to
flag]{.underline}. And today, for reasons including [demographic
disaster and the lingering effects of]{.underline} the
[COVID]{.underline}-19 pandemic, [China is facing the end of the
stunning economic growth]{.underline} that made it possible for Xi to
assert that the "great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation" was at hand.
The [China of the 2020s will be a country whose coercive capabilities
are more intimidating than ever as its economic dynamism
fade]{.underline}s. [That could be]{.underline} **[the worst possible
combination]{.underline}** [for the world.]{.underline} Any country that
rises as impressively as China is bound to make fools of some prophets
of decline along the way. In recent decades, [Beijing has repeatedly
confounded those who predicted it was about to hit the
wall.]{.underline} In the aftermath of Mao Zedong's death, some [Western
observers were skeptical that China]{.underline}---a country that U.S.
diplomat George Kennan once called a "vast poorhouse"---[could put
together the policies necessary for sustained growth]{.underline}. After
the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, it was common to wonder whether
the resulting political crackdown would stifle the country's prosperity.
Through the early 2000s, [social scientists]{.underline} and U.S.
officials [predicted that China could be rich or
autocratic]{.underline}---[but not both]{.underline}. A few prominent
[analysts made careers for themselves by heralding China's collapse. It
hasn't happened---yet]{.underline}. From 1978 to the onset of the global
financial crisis three decades later, [China's constant-dollar GDP grew
by a factor of 17]{.underline}, [without the]{.underline} Chinese
Communist Party ([CCP) losing control]{.underline}. [That]{.underline}
growth [enabled]{.underline} the decades-long [military buildup
and]{.underline} sprawling [economic influence]{.underline} that made
China a force to be feared on the global stage. As Tufts University's
Michael [Beckley and I argue]{.underline} in our forthcoming book,
Danger Zone: The Coming Conflict With China, [this economic miracle
required good luck and good policy]{.underline}. China seemed to have
hit the demographic jackpot in the 1980s and 1990s; the unlikely
combination of warfare and famine in the 1930s and 1940s, a
regime-sponsored baby boom after the CCP took power, and then the
institution of the one-child policy in 1980 left the country with a huge
working-age population unencumbered by lots of young or old dependents.
China was nearly self-sufficient in food, water, and other resources.
And it had the fortuitous timing to start its reforms as globalization
went into overdrive, making it easier to integrate the country into
complex supply chains and thereby make China the workshop of the world.
Good policies were also crucial. Mao's one-man rule and economic
illiteracy had condemned China to serial, self-created disasters. Once
he died, Deng Xiaoping and his successors moved toward a "socialist
market economy." They opened China to trade and investment, overhauled
the tax and regulatory systems, shrank bloated state-owned enterprises,
and encouraged private business. Accompanying political reforms limited
the power of China's rulers and enlarged the space for nonideological
competence within the regime. The CCP relaxed its grip enough to permit
economic spontaneity---and reaped the benefits in the form of prosperity
that reinforced its political control. [China's ascendance shook the
world]{.underline} intellectually as well as geopolitically: [It
undermined post-Cold War Western beliefs that prosperity would lead
inevitably to political liberalization]{.underline}, [that democracies
produced higher rates of growth than autocracies, and that tyranny was
incompatible with sound economic management]{.underline}. As China
became a global heavyweight, a new orthodoxy solidified---that a
hegemonic transition was approaching as Beijing surpassed the United
States. One dissenter was the political scientist David Shambaugh. In
[2015, Shambaugh argued that China was suffering from a deep internal
malaise and that **Xi's increasingly repressive rule was a sign of
insecurity, not confidence**]{.underline}. "\[F\]or all the Western
views of it as an unstoppable juggernaut," he wrote, [China's economy
"is stuck in a series of systemic traps]{.underline} from which there is
no easy exit." Shambaugh struck a discordant note at a time when Beijing
was tightening its control of the South China Sea and spreading its
influence across multiple continents. [He]{.underline} also [happened to
be right]{.underline}. Not least of the oddities surrounding
contemporary China is that [much of the world deemed its ascent
inevitable just as its prospects started to dim.]{.underline} This may
sound absurd, given all the hype surrounding China's rise. After all,
that country is supposedly destined, as the Harvard University political
scientist Graham Allison (channeling legendary Singaporean Prime
Minister Lee Kuan Yew) has written, to become "the biggest player in the
history of the world." It's true that [China does boast many apparent
advantages]{.underline}. [It has an enormous domestic
market]{.underline} and is the leading trade partner of roughly 130
countries around the world. [It is making concerted investments
in]{.underline} artificial intelligence ([AI]{.underline}),
[semiconductors, and other critical technologies]{.underline}. [If the
United States doesn't up its game]{.underline}, a national commission
chaired by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt warned in 2021, [China could
become the premier "AI superpower."]{.underline} [But look closer, and
China's trajectory starts to seem more tenuous]{.underline}. For one
thing, many of China's technological achievements are narrower and less
impressive than they first appear. For example, [Beijing has made great
strides in AI]{.underline} applications [focused on
surveillance]{.underline} (no surprise there), but [the United States
still leads]{.underline} significantly [across]{.underline} the
[wider]{.underline} expanse of [AI subfields]{.underline} and uses.
Despite vast state subsidies, [China's Semiconductor
Manufacturing]{.underline} International Corp. [is years
behind]{.underline} in the creation of cutting-edge semiconductors that
make up the foundation of advanced economies in the information age.
Just this year, Peking University published a candid assessment---which
the CCP then predictably censored---of China's progress in science and
technology. The verdict was that [China is "following \[the United
States\] in most fields, running side by side in a few, and leading in
very few."]{.underline} And [while China's]{.underline} [other strengths
are not illusory]{.underline}, [neither can they hide a reality
that]{.underline} Beckley and I discussed last year: The magic that made
[China's economic miracle is unmistakably fizzling]{.underline}. The
country's resource abundance is old news: [Overuse
devastated]{.underline} much of China's [arable land;]{.underline}
industrialization and pollution left the country with severe water
scarcity. More damaging still, China's abundance of human resources is
also a thing of the past. [The one-child policy]{.underline} was a
devil's bargain that [is now causing demographic implosion]{.underline}.
[China's]{.underline} total [population is set to peak by]{.underline}
2028 (or perhaps [as soon as this year]{.underline}, by some estimates)
[and then plummet]{.underline} by as much as half by century's end. [Its
working population crested in 2015]{.underline}; it will fall by 70
million between 2020 and 2035 and even faster after that. [China
will]{.underline} soon combine an enormous geriatric population with a
rapidly shrinking workforce. It will [experience one of the worst
peacetime demographic crunches]{.underline} on record, [a formula
for]{.underline} stagnation at best and [**catastrophic economic
contraction** at worst]{.underline}. Making matters worse, [the era of
enlightened economic policy is over]{.underline}. The reform agenda has
been stalled for more than a decade because further
liberalization---necessary to make the leap to a more innovative,
knowledge-based economy---would threaten the privileges of entrenched
elites. If anything, Xi has thrown the country into reverse.
Politically, [he is taking China into **neototalitarianism** through
pervasive repression and indoctrination]{.underline}. And economically,
his policies have a decidedly retrograde feel. [Xi's agenda has
featured]{.underline} a preference for [state-owned enterprises at the
expense of the]{.underline} more vibrant [private sector;]{.underline}
the imposition of [severe, politically motivated
restrictions]{.underline} on wide swaths of the economy; [attacks on the
autonomy of]{.underline} relatively technocratic institutions such as
[the]{.underline} central [bank]{.underline}; and the empowerment of
political minders in companies of nearly all sizes. China's leaders may
talk about the need to transition to a high-tech, services-based
economy, but [Xi's policies are stifling]{.underline} the competence,
creativity, and spontaneity necessary to make that shift. [It all
constitutes a "great leap backward]{.underline}"---a reversion [to
pre-Deng-era policies that condemned China to stagnation.]{.underline}
There is also the question of what Xi's consolidation of power means for
the country's long-term resilience. As the political theorist Francis
Fukuyama has written, for nearly 40 years after Mao's death China
avoided the "bad emperor" problem---the worst pathologies that accompany
authoritarian rule---by imposing term limits on its rulers and making
them more accountable to other CCP elites. Yet [Xi has systematically
disassembled this system by purging rivals, sidelining potential
successors, and entrenching himself in power]{.underline}. By doing so,
[he is enabling China to move faster and more decisively]{.underline}.
[But]{.underline} he is [also]{.underline} [leaving the country
vulnerable to impulsive or unwise decision-making]{.underline}---a
perpetual problem of one-man rule---[and]{.underline} creating the
potential for **[terrible instability]{.underline}** when his reign
finally ends. [Xi's centralization of authority]{.underline}, while
seemingly impressive, [is setting the country up for a
fall]{.underline}. Finally, it doesn't help [that a more assertive China
is now facing more international resistance. Trade barrier]{.underline}s
against Chinese companies and products proliferated in the decade [after
the global financial crisis]{.underline}. [Washington has waged a
technological cold war]{.underline} against Huawei, seeking to deprive
that Chinese firm of high-end semiconductors and keep it out of the
world's 5G networks. Dozens of countries are more carefully scrutinizing
their economic, financial, and technological ties with Beijing; the
Japanese government is offering to pay companies to reduce their China
exposure. [China is still central to the global economy, but the days
when the United States and other powerful countries eagerly abetted its
ascent are over.]{.underline} Indeed, Xi's effort to cultivate the
domestic market is an implicit admission that [China, which rose on the
strength of an export-focused economy, now confronts a very different
world.]{.underline} China's predicament has been thrown into relief,
ironically, by COVID-19. Early on, the pandemic seemed to herald an
epochal global shift. Prominent U.S. analysts saw it as a "Suez moment,"
the terminal crisis of the U.S. empire. Xi touted his regime's success
in containing COVID-19 at home (albeit after allowing it to escape to
the world) as an advertisement for Chinese authoritarianism. Two years
later, it's clear that COVID-19 was a turning point but not in the way
that Xi hoped. [The pandemic hypercharged global anti-China
sentiment]{.underline}, after Beijing concealed the initial outbreak and
then exploited the resulting chaos to bully nations from Australia to
Germany and the United Kingdom. It thereby encouraged a host of
efforts---through multilateral institutions such as the Quadrilateral
Security Dialogue, AUKUS, and the G-7, as well as the United States'
bilateral alliances in the Pacific---to counter Chinese power. "[A Cold
War mentality" had reemerged]{.underline}, a spokesperson for China's
foreign ministry complained, [as the United States and its friends
pursued "anti-China encirclement."]{.underline} COVID-19 also confirmed
how patchy China's rise had been: The country's biotechnology sector
couldn't produce anything like the revolutionary vaccines that
democratic innovation economies in the United States and Europe churned
out. Even China's heavy-handed success in containing COVID-19 at home
became a trap: The combination of "zero-COVID" policies, low levels of
natural immunity, and vaccines that proved weak or worthless against
highly contagious variants condemned the country to recurring lockdowns
of major cities, with all the accompanying disruptions. [Even before
COVID]{.underline}-19, in fact, [China's economic vital signs were
worrying]{.underline}. The government claimed a growth rate of 6
percent, but [Chinese insiders and academic research indicate
that]{.underline} the true number is considerably lower---and even that
[growth is inflated by the relentless injection of capital into a less
and less efficient economy]{.underline}. As a result, [overall **debt
grew eightfold**]{.underline} between 2008 and the end of 2020, reaching
335 percent of GDP. In other countries, this combination of slumping
productivity and growing debt usually presages sharp crises that turn
into lasting economic quagmires. Xi's Chinese dream involves catching up
to the United States. In reality, [his country is slowing
down]{.underline}. China is not, however, slowing down in all areas at
once. This isn't unusual: The Soviet Union hit the apex of its military
power in the 1980s, when its economy was in a death spiral. In the early
20th century, Britain ruled a global empire at a time when its economic
supremacy had already slipped away. Today, [China is stagnating
economically, but **its drive for world power is accelerating.** Chinese
leaders and propaganda organs now]{.underline} openly [tout]{.underline}
the country's designs: [In the coming decades]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} official [state news agency]{.underline} Xinhua
[proclaimed]{.underline}, **[China will "re-ascend to the top of the
world."]{.underline}** [Beijing is **creating new international
organizations and co-opting others**]{.underline}. Its marquee projects,
namely [the Belt and Road Initiative and the Digital Silk Road, aim to
**project economic and political influence** across Eurasia and
beyond.]{.underline} [China]{.underline} also fashions itself as an
ideological role model for other countries: Its style of governance, Xi
has said, [offers a "new option for]{.underline} other countries and
[nations that want to speed up their development]{.underline} while
preserving their independence." Most notably, [China is building and
wielding the tools of **geopolitical coercion**]{.underline}. Countries
such as [Australia, Lithuania, Norway, and South Korea have felt China's
economic bite after they opposed its policies or criticized its internal
practices]{.underline}. [Chinese **military
spending**---having]{.underline} already **[grown tenfold]{.underline}**
in real terms between 1990 and 2016---[continues to rise]{.underline},
[funding a dramatic expansion]{.underline} of the capabilities needed
[to conquer Taiwan, overawe]{.underline} Beijing's [neighbors,
and]{.underline} perhaps even **[take on the United
States]{.underline}** in the Western Pacific. [What the United States
will face in this decade is a China whose **ability to** batter its
enemies and **challenge the global order is growing**, even as leaner
economic times loom ahead.]{.underline} The statistics are simply
astounding: [Beijing put as many ships to sea from 2014 to 2018
as]{.underline} were [in]{.underline} the navies of [Britain, Germany,
India, Spain, and Taiwan combined]{.underline}. And having long avoided
a nuclear arms race with Washington, [Beijing is now sprinting forward
and could be the United States' **nuclear peer by the
2030**]{.underline}s. [Threats to use force]{.underline} against enemies
[have]{.underline} also [become ubiquitous]{.underline}: **[Anyone who
obstructs China's plans]{.underline}**, Xi warned in 2021,
**[will]{.underline}** "**[have their heads bashed bloody]{.underline}**
against the Great Wall of Steel." It is sometimes hard to believe that
such a country is running out of gas. But perhaps [China's **strategic
urgency is increasing** because its economic outlook has turned
grim.]{.underline} China's "[hide and bide]{.underline}" strategy---the
approach it followed for a generation under Deng and
after---[was]{.underline} [one of patient confidence]{.underline}. If
time was on a rising Beijing's side, then it made sense to gradually
build the country's power and delay confrontation with the United
States. [Today]{.underline}, [China's strategic mindset is darker and
more insistent.]{.underline} In many areas, Xi acknowledges, "the West
is strong, and the East is weak." [China must race to make itself
"invincible" so that "nobody can beat us or choke us to
death."]{.underline} What the United States will face in this decade,
then, is a China whose ability to batter its enemies and challenge the
global order is growing, even as leaner economic times loom ahead. This
**[China is unlikely to be benign or peaceful]{.underline}**. History
has seen many [once ascendant countries]{.underline} **[lash out
violently]{.underline}** [rather than accept a disappointing future as a
second-tier power]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} fear is what [led
Germany]{.underline} [to]{.underline} take the risks that helped [ignite
World War I]{.underline}. [It prompted Japan to undertake]{.underline}
the expansionist rampage that helped bring on [World War
II.]{.underline} [Xi has grand ambitions, from capturing Taiwan to
establishing China's primacy in Asia and, eventually, the
world]{.underline}. [If he loses faith that the patient accumulation of
economic power will bring Beijing these rewards, he may become more
inclined to take risks and **use China's coercive tools** to secure them
instead]{.underline}. This means that the task of dealing with China
could prove quite ticklish in the years ahead. [**The United States
can't** simply **rest easy**, confident that a peaking China will fade
away]{.underline}. Instead, [it will have to rapidly firm up its
defenses in places where an impatient Beijing might lunge for
advantage]{.underline}, such as the Western Pacific. The United States
and its [**allies** will have to **join forces**]{.underline} [to
prevent China from weaponizing its]{.underline} still considerable
[economic and technological leverage]{.underline} to fracture the
anti-Beijing coalitions now taking shape. And they will have to [ensure,
through multilateral control]{.underline} measures [as well as
investments in their own capabilities]{.underline}, [that the democratic
world maintains its edge in semiconductors and other **critical
technologies**]{.underline} [that will shape the future balance of
economic and military power]{.underline}. Yet Washington and its friends
will also have to do all this [while]{.underline} keeping channels of
communication open and **[not unnecessarily provoking]{.underline}** [an
anxious China that may **lash out** as its predicament
worsens.]{.underline} After all, [power and pessimism can make a deadly
mix]{.underline}. [The hardest sort of China to handle may be one that
is strong and weak.]{.underline}

Can we pay the Chinese Communist Party the compliment of acknowledging
that it means what it says and knows what it wants? That may be the key
to understanding Beijing's strategic ambitions in the coming decades. A
long-standing trope in the U.S. debate on that subject is that China
itself doesn't know what it seeks to achieve, that its leaders haven't
yet worked out how far Beijing's influence should reach. Yet [there is a
growing body of evidence, assembled and interpreted by talented China
experts, that the Chinese government is indeed **aiming
for**]{.underline} global power and perhaps **[global
primacy]{.underline}** over the next generation --- [that it seeks to
**upend the American-led international system** and create
at]{.underline} least a **[competing]{.underline}**, quasi-**[world
order]{.underline}** [of its **own**]{.underline}. It doesn't take
unparalleled powers of deduction to reach this conclusion. Top Chinese
officials and members of the country's foreign policy community are
becoming increasingly explicit in saying so
themselves**[.]{.underline}** President [Xi]{.underline} Jinping **[more
than hinted]{.underline}** [at this goal]{.underline} [in
his]{.underline} landmark [address to the **19th Party Congress** in
**October 2017.**]{.underline} That speech represents one of the most
authoritative statements of the party's policy and aims; it reflects
Xi's understanding of what China has accomplished under Communist rule
and how it must advance in the future. Xi declared that China "has stood
up, grown rich, and is becoming strong," and that it was now "blazing a
new trail for other developing countries" and offering "Chinese wisdom
and a Chinese approach to solving the problems facing mankind." [By
2049, Xi promised, China would "become a **global** **leader**
in]{.underline} terms of composite **[national strength]{.underline}**
[and **international influence**"]{.underline} [and would build a
"**stable international order**" in which China's "**national
rejuvenation**" could be **fully achieved.** This]{.underline} was the
[statement]{.underline} of a leader who sees his country not just
participating in global affairs but setting the terms, and it [testifies
to **two core themes** in **China's foreign policy discourse**. The
first is a **deeply skeptical view** of the existing international
system]{.underline}. Chinese leaders recognize that the global trade
regime has been indispensable to the country's economic and military
rise. Yet when they look at the key features of the world Washington and
its allies have made, they see mostly threats. [In their view, American
alliances **do not preserve peace** and **stability**; they **stunt
China's potential**]{.underline} and prevent Asian nations from giving
Beijing its due. Seen through that lens, promoting democracy and human
rights is neither moral nor benign, but propaganda supporting a
dangerous doctrine that threatens to delegitimize the Communist
government and energize its domestic enemies. [U.S.-led international
institutions appear as tools for imposing America's will on]{.underline}
weaker states. [The Communist Party **recognizes** that the liberal
international order has brought **benefits**]{.underline}, writes Nadege
Rolland, a senior fellow at the National Bureau of Asian Research, [but
"the party **abhors** and **dreads**" the principles **on which it is
based**. The second theme is that the international order **must
change**]{.underline} --- [not a **little**, but a **lot**]{.underline}
[--- for China to **become fully prosperous** and
**secure**]{.underline}. Chinese leaders have, understandably, been
somewhat opaque in describing the world they want, but the outlines are
becoming easier to discern. If one studies the statements of Xi and
other top officials, China expert Liza Tobin concludes, what emerges is
a vision in which "[a **global network of partnerships** centered on
China would **replace** the **U.S. system of treaty
alliances**]{.underline}" and the world would view Chinese
authoritarianism as preferable to Western democracy. Based on a similar
analysis, Rolland agrees that [China has]{.underline} "[a **yearning
for**]{.underline} partial **[hegemony]{.underline}**," [a **loose
dominance** over **large swaths of the global south**]{.underline}. When
it comes to global governance, still other examinations show, Beijing
wants a system in which international institutions buttress rather than
batter repressive regimes. Meanwhile, Chinese strategists and academics
are talking openly about building a "new China-centric global economic
order." There is little indication, in any of this, that Beijing's
strategic horizon is limited to the Western Pacific or even Asia. Xi's
invocation of a "community with a shared future for humanity" indicates
a global tableau for Chinese influence. One hardly has to read between
the lines to understand that [this agenda will require **fundamentally
resetting the current geopolitical balance**]{.underline}. As Xi
remarked several years ago, China must work resolutely toward "a future
where we will win the initiative and have the dominant position." Of
course, there's not need to take literally everything national leaders
say, or even everything that makes it into official speeches. [In
Beijing's case, however, Chinese leaders are actually saying **less**
than what the **country is doing.**]{.underline} Whether it is [the
naval shipbuilding program that is churning out vessels at astonishing
rate\[s\]; the drive to control existing international organizations and
build new ones; the projection of military power in the Arctic, the
Indian Ocean and]{.underline} points **[beyond]{.underline}**; [the
quest to **dominate** the world's **high-tech industries**]{.underline};
[the **ever-more systematic efforts** to **support authoritarian
regimes**]{.underline} [and **weaken democratic
institutions**]{.underline}; [or the **Belt and Road
Initiative**]{.underline} [that encompasses **multiple
continents**]{.underline}, [China is **hardly acting** like a country
that **lacks** a **grand geopolitical design**.]{.underline} As with so
many aspects of the U.S.-China competition, [there is a **Cold War
parallel**]{.underline}. During the 1970s, some [leading]{.underline}
American [Sovietologists]{.underline} [**insisted** that **Moscow** was
becoming a **satisfied, status quo power**]{.underline}. Yet [that claim
**required** **ignoring** what Soviet leaders **said** about **detente**
and **peaceful coexistence**]{.underline} --- that it was a way of
ensuring the triumph of socialism without war --- [as well as their
efforts to build military superiority]{.underline} and positions of
strength in the Third World. The warning signs were evident then, as
they are today.

### 2AC -- Russia Revisionist

#### Russia is a real revisionist threat that seeks expansionism -- Crimea, Georgia, and Ukraine all prove.

Andrei P. **Tsygankov** 20**21** \[The Revisionist Moment: Russia,
Trump, and Global Transition, Problems of Post-Communism, 68:6, 457-467,
DOI: 10.1080/10758216.2020.1788397\] //WA

**[Russia's interventions in Ukraine]{.underline}** and Syria
**[reflected the Kremlin's insistence on]{.underline}** the principles
of a multipolar balance of **[power]{.underline}** and
cultural/civilizational diversity **[in international
relations.]{.underline}** In Syria, Russia also defended the principle
of sovereignty and noninterference by outside powers without the
government's authorization. In upholding these principles Moscow sought
to demonstrate what Russia's president Vladimir Putin defined as
"geopolitical relevance." **[Russia took its assertive foreign
policy]{.underline}** to a new level **[by demonstrat- ing the ability
to project power across continents]{.underline}**. The new Concept of
Foreign Policy signed by Putin on November 30, 2016, stressed the
importance of defending the country's cultural distinctiveness in the
context of new international challenges and attempts by the United
States to preserve global dominance. The document posited Russia's
"right for a tough response to unfriendly actions including by strength-
ening national defense and implementing symmetric and asymmetric
measures" (Concept of Foreign Policy of the Russian Federation 2016).
Since then, **[Russia has sought to demonstrate its power
in]{.underline}** several other **[areas including nuclear, cyber, and
covert military capabilities]{.underline}**.1 It has also interfered in
elections in several European countries and the United States, prompting
a new Western debate on Russia's intentions and capabilities.2 **[As
Russia's assertiveness has reached]{.underline}** new
**[heights]{.underline}**, **[scholars have]{.underline}** frequently
**[discussed it as indicative of the country's
revisionism]{.underline}**. Like assertiveness, revisionism is a
response to perceived disrespect of Russia's interests and values by
for- eign/Western powers. The difference between assertiveness and
revisionism is one of degree. While assertiveness is lim- ited to
rhetorical and localized resistance to established inter- national
rules, revisionism is associated with stretching and even breaking
global rules in the interest of pushing toward a new international
order.3 [Russia's use of force in Georgia]{.underline} in August 2008
[was an example of stretching international rules]{.underline},
including those established following the end of the Cold War. By
intervening in Georgia, **[Russia]{.underline}** **[challenged the
principle of national sover- eignty and undermined the United States'
hegemonic mono- poly on the international use of force]{.underline}**.
However, the Kremlin was also responding to Tbilisi's attack on Russian
peace- keepers and civilians. Having completed a military operation, the
Kremlin negotiated a ceasefire and withdrew from Georgian territory,
leaving it to the Georgian people to decide their political future. At
the same time, Russia recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South
Ossetia, extending sup- port to territories that were under Georgian
jurisdiction but not formally annexing them. Russia was also not alone
in acting in such a manner: precedents for rule stretching already
existed. For example, as Yugoslavia disintegrated, its territories'
declarations of independence were increasingly recognized by outside
powers. In particular, Kosovo declared independence from Serbia on
February 17, 2008, which was before Russia's 2008 actions with respect
to Georgia. Recognition of Kosovo would breach the sovereignty princi-
ple. The decision to recognize Kosovo generated opposition from Russia,
China, and India, but was supported by the United States, Britain, and
France. As the latter three have been among the guarantors of the
post--Cold War system, with the United States serving as the hegemon,
their support opened the path for Kosovo to gain further international
recognition within the United Nations. [The Crimea
annexation]{.underline} in March 2014 [was the next stage of Russia's
revisionism that could be viewed as an example of breaking international
rules,]{.underline} [in particular the principles of national
sovereignty]{.underline}. Although the Crimean referendum was indicative
of the residents' desire to join Russia, it was con- ducted under
conditions of international crisis, Russia's mili- tary presence, and
without international consent.4 Since 2014 the Kremlin has been pressing
for not simply Russia-sensitive Western policies but a new international
order built on dif- ferent rules and a balance of power. No other power,
includ- ing the United States, had previously increased its territory at
the expense of others by breaking international rules in achieving its
foreign policy objectives. However, on March 25, 2019, the United States
recognized the Golan Heights as part of Israel. In the absence of any
referendum or United Nations recognition, the United States called the
annexation "not necessarily illegal" and subject to a judicial
resolution by the Israeli courts. Russia's revisionism is puzzling to
both realist and liberal theorists of international relations. Realists
correctly identify the West's policies as a key source of Russia's
revisionism (Mearsheimer 2014), yet they remain puzzled by the Kremlin's
readiness to increase its dependence on China. Realists view such a
course as unsustainable in the medium- term perspective and assume that
Russia will rebuild its ties with the United States, even under the U.S.
framework of preserved international unipolarity and global leadership.5
Liberals too are puzzled by Russia's revisionism. They have long argued
that Russia remains economically and politically vulnerable and is in no
position to challenge America's global leadership. Even with Barack
Obama out of power, the view that Russia is a declining autocratic power
with unsustainable international behavior remains dominant in
Washington's liberal policy circles (Gunitsky and Tsygankov 2018). In
explaining Russia's international behavior, this paper makes several
related arguments. First, I argue that revision- ism is systemic and
cannot be attributed solely to Russia's great power ambitions. Since the
late 2000s, revisionism has been stimulated by the declining role of the
United States in the international system and a global transition toward
a new international order. Donald Trump's lack of interest in pre-
serving the United States' global leadership and ties with allies, while
not being the cause, has been an important con- tributing factor to
facilitating world order transition. Second, I show that Russia's
domestic support for revisio- nist foreign policy is not uniformly
shared across the political spectrum. Different Russian groups view
revisionism differ- ently and demonstrate diverse attitudes with respect
to their preferred world order and foreign policy. While some Russian
elites support continued disruption of the U.S.-centered inter- national
order, others warn about Russia's vulnerabilities and insist on
demonstrating not only Russia's power capabilities but also the
potential for cooperation with the United States. Because of Western
pressures and Russia's self-perception of being a great power, the
former group enjoys a position of relative dominance and support by the
Kremlin. While displaying differences with respect to foreign policy
preferences and justifying their support on different grounds, elites
and the general public have remained generally sympa- thetic with the
Kremlin's actions abroad. All remain in agree- ment that Russia must
protect its great power status and do so by way of engaging the United
States in meaningful interna- tional relations and by observing relevant
international trea- ties. In particular, Moscow has proposed to view the
global COVID-19 crisis as an opportunity to form a new, universally
shared world order. Putin reenergized his contacts with Trump by
discussing the possibility of holding a new inter- national summit and
negotiating a new agreement with OPEC to stabilize oil prices (Frolov
2020). I argue that **[Russia's domestic attitudes are best understood
in terms of the country's nationally shared belief in being a great
power and its attempts to gain recognition of that status by the outside
world]{.underline}**---**[first and foremost the West]{.underline}**.
Scholars have argued that, at least since Yevgeny Primakov's appointment
as foreign minister (1996--1998), Russian foreign policy has
demonstrated a considerable degree of continuity based on a commitment
to the preservation of great power status (Gorenburg 2019). That
commitment remains in place, even as the country has been negatively
affected by economic decline and the proliferation of the coronavirus.6

[When the Soviet Union collapsed, competition between the United States
and Russia also ended, temporarily.]{.underline} Under the guidance of
President Boris Yeltsin, the new leadership in Russia aspired to
consolidate democracy and capitalism at home and championed integration
into the liberal international order. Although the results of both
agendas were mixed throughout the 1990s, ideological competition played
little to no role in shaping Russia's relations with "the West,"1 in
general, and the United States, in particular. [Times have changed under
President Vladimir Putin. Gradually over the last two decades and
increasingly since 2014, when Putin annexed Crimea and intervened in
eastern Ukraine, Russia and the United States, as well as Russia and the
West, have clashed.]{.underline} Many [politicians and analysts now
compare the current level of confrontation to the Cold
War.2]{.underline} At the Munich Security Conference in 2016, Prime
[Minister Dmitry Medvedev referenced the Cuban missile crisis as a
similar moment in bilateral tensions: "Speaking bluntly, we are rapidly
rolling into a period of a new cold war. . . . I am sometimes confused:
is this 2016 or 1962?"3 Echoing Medvedev, Ernest Moniz and Sam Nunn
wrote, "Not since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis has the risk of a
U.S.-Russian confrontation been as high as it is today."]{.underline}4
In April 2018, President Donald Trump declared on Twitter: "Our
relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that
includes the Cold War."5 What happened? [How did the United States and
Russia move from cooperative ties, strategic partnerships, shared
domestic goals, and international norms a few decades ago to a new era
of conflict in U.S.-Russian relations and Russia's relationship with the
West more generally?]{.underline} One explanation---perhaps most widely
held---is that cooperation was an interregnum driven by Russian
weakness. After Russia's recovery from the dissolution of the Soviet
Union, normal great power competition has returned.6 The Soviet Union
annexed territory, intervened militarily to prop up regimes, and even
tried to influence elections in Western democracies. Upon regaining
these capabilities, a rising Russia is "destined" to clash with the
incumbent global superpower, just as China is currently doing as well.7
[Russia's negative reaction to U.S. unipolarity was inevitable,
determined by the structure of the international system. For thousands
of years, great powers have risen, fallen, and clashed. There is nothing
new or peculiar about current clashes between Russia and the United
States or between Russia and the West more generally, according to this
perspective]{.underline}. [A second explanation of Russia's increasing
confrontation with the West focuses on historical and cultural
continuities in Russian international behavior. Whether Committee for
State Security (KGB) agents, democrats, Communist Party general
secretaries, or tsars sit in the Kremlin, Russian international conduct
has remained largely consistent.8]{.underline} Well before the
Bolsheviks seized power in 1917, Russian tsars annexed territory,
intervened militarily to assist allies, and meddled in the domestic
affairs of foes.9 Russia, today, is acting like Russia has always acted,
or so this argument contends. The Gorbachev and Yeltsin years were an
aberration. Russia is back on its historical equilibrium path[. Both of
these explanations allow no role for the agency of individual leaders
and their ideas in the analysis.]{.underline} This article advances an
alternative explanation that focuses [on individuals, ideas, and
domestic institutions as important factors shaping Russian international
behavior]{.underline}. Russia was not destined to return to a
confrontational relationship with the United States or the West because
of the balance of power in the international system or historical and
cultural determinants. [Rather, President Putin chose this path. Despite
consciously invoking realist rhetoric and historic traditions to justify
his international behavior, Putin has demonstrated agency in the making
of Russian foreign policy. Individuals matter.10 A different Russian
leader could have chosen a different path.]{.underline}11 Second, and
closely related, [ideas matter]{.underline}. If all leaders acted
rationally and in the same way, it would be impossible to identify the
unique causal impact of individual leaders in shaping foreign policy.12
In the case of Russia, [if Putin had defined his foreign policy agenda
always through a realist lens, his individual impact on Russian foreign
policy would be difficult to distinguish from realist theory
explanations.]{.underline} [Putin's behavior, however, has not always
correlated with realist predictions. A second argument advanced in this
article is that leaders have a menu of ideas from which to choose in
seeking to explain the world and then act in it. Realist ideas offer
one, but not the only, option. International factors, domestic
institutions, and bureaucratic politics shape, but do not determine,
individual decisions and actions.]{.underline} Different choices made by
individuals regarding analytical frameworks produce variation in foreign
policy outcomes even when other factors---the international balance of
power, historical legacies, or regime type---are held constant. [Putin
selected a unique trajectory for Russian foreign policy because of a set
of particular ideas that he developed about the nature of Russia, the
United States, and international relations more broadly.13 He embraced
and propagated illiberal, conservative nationalism to advance his
definition of national interests. Putin also developed a particular
theory about U.S. foreign policy, which he defines as hostile to Russian
national interests and antithetical to Russian orthodox
values.]{.underline}14 Some analysts have labeled this set of ideas
"Putinism,"15 while others see Putin as part of a broader transnational
ideological movement in support of autocracy.16 In either instance,
Putin's ideas play a causal role in the conduct of Russian foreign
policy. [Had Putin embraced a different theory of international politics
or a different ideological framework---realism, liberalism, or even
communism---Russia under his leadership would have behaved differently
on the global stage. Regarding the three cases examined in this article,
Putin's decisions to intervene in Ukraine in 2014, Syria in 2015, and
the United States in 2016 reflect the triumph of his illiberal ideas
over other analytic frameworks]{.underline} (i.e., realism or
liberalism[) in shaping Russian foreign policy]{.underline}. Different
from a powerful state intervening in other states solely to maximize
power, [Putinism divides the world along ideological]{.underline} lines.
[These ideas both encourage certain interventions,]{.underline}
including the cases discussed in this article[, and constrain
intervention in support of perceived liberal projects, including Libya
in 2011 and Syria in 2012, that might have produced gains in Russian
power and prestige]{.underline}.17 Third, institutions matter. [The
Russian system of government became increasingly autocratic during
Putin's two decades of rule, giving Putin more autonomy and more
influence over Russian foreign policy. A more democratic system would
have placed greater constraints on Putin's individual foreign policy
decisions.]{.underline}18 Of course, power matters, too.19 [Without the
capabilities to annex territory, conduct air strikes, or steal digital
property, Putin could not have intervened in Ukraine in 2014, Syria in
2015, or the United States in 2016.]{.underline} A narrow focus on
Russian power or the global balance of power, however, cannot fully
explain these interventions. As Elizabeth Saunders argues, "[Theories
relying on relatively stable or slow-changing factors such as the
structure of the international system or regime type cannot fully
account for changes in a state's intervention choice over time. Moving
the level of analysis to individual leaders can help to address this
variation]{.underline}."20 New Russian capabilities did not make these
Russian interventions inevitable. Other options were available.21 [A
different Russian leader, with different ideas, ruling in a different
political system could have chosen to use Russian power in a different
way.22 Only by adding domestic-level and individual-level
variables---leaders, ideas, and institutions---can a comprehensive
explanation of Russian foreign policy be developed.]{.underline} The
argument advanced in this article is not that Putin and his illiberal
ideas always shape Russian foreign policy behavior on every issue in
ways inconsistent with realist and liberal theories or ideologies.
Nevertheless, interventions in the domestic affairs of other countries
offer a good test of this argument, given that such actions are rare and
often costly.23 This argument parallels many accounts of U.S. foreign
policy in which realism explains some, but not all, international
behavior.24 Realist scholars have invoked the causal impact of liberal
ideas---"the hell of good intentions" or "liberal dreams"---to explain
U.S. foreign policy departures from realist predictions, especially
regarding interventions in other states.25 This article makes the same
theoretical move, [tracing the impact of Putin's illiberal ideas to
understand specific Russian foreign policy actions that depart from
realist predictions. Explaining scientifically the causal relationship
between individuals, ideas, and institutions, on the one hand, and
Russian foreign policy, on the other, is challenging. To ignore the
domestic determinants of contemporary Russian behavior in the world,
however, is to oversimplify and distort the drivers of current tensions
in U.S.-Russian relations: a danger for theorists and policymakers
alike.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Russia Bad -- Human Rights

**[found "credible evidence" of violations of]{.underline}** fundamental
**[human rights in]{.underline}** areas of **[Ukraine]{.underline}**
that were largely **[under Russian control]{.underline}**. The **[report

[Biden](https://thehill.com/people/biden/) on Tuesday said Russian
President [**[Vladimir
Putin]{.underline}**](https://thehill.com/people/vladimir-putin/) **[had
committed genocide in Ukraine]{.underline}**, echoing a charge made by
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The OSCE report marks one of the
first published investigations into atrocities occurring in Ukraine. The
document will be available to judicial bodies aiming to prosecute
violators of international humanitarian law. The report found that
[Russia had deliberately struck a maternity hospital in]{.underline}
Mariupol on March 9, [offering no warning]{.underline}. It labeled it [a
"clear violation" of]{.underline} **[international humanitarian law and
a war crime.]{.underline}** The report also cites [a]{.underline} March
16 [attack on a drama theater]{.underline} in [Mariupol where up to
1,300 people had been seeking shelter]{.underline}. Both sides of [the
theater were clearly marked "children" to discourage an
attack]{.underline}. **[Three hundred people were killed in the
strike.]{.underline}** U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE Michael Carpenter in
a Wednesday statement said the report "**[documents the catalog of
inhumanity perpetrated by Russia's forces in Ukraine]{.underline}**." He
also raised concern that "**[Russia's atrocities continue even after
this report's conclusion]{.underline}**." The OSCE is made up of 68
nations, including European countries, Russia and participating states
like the U.S. A majority of the body voted on March 3 to launch an
independent investigation under the auspices of the "Moscow Mechanism,"
a measure established in 1991 to investigate and document allegations of
humanitarian law violations and war crimes taking place in member
states. The report notes that Russia's representative to the OSCE
rejected participating in the investigation, calling the Moscow
Mechanism "largely outdated and redundant," the investigators wrote. The
report only covers a period of three weeks, between March 15 and April
5, and does not include atrocities discovered in cities and towns
surrounding Kyiv after the retreat of Russian forces, including evidence
of extrajudicial killings, torture and rape. The report also does not
include an alleged Russian attack on a train station in Kramatorsk on
April 8, where an estimated 57 civilians were killed as they were trying
to flee the city. Carpenter, in his remarks, raised concern over new
allegations that Russia may have or is preparing to deploy chemical
weapons as part of its assault. "**[We must]{.underline}** now urgently
**[gather the evidence to ensure there is accountability for what could
well be another war crime in Ukraine]{.underline}**," the ambassador
said. The U.S. has not confirmed allegations by Ukrainian forces in
Mariupol that **[Russia has deployed chemical weapons]{.underline}**
**[but said it has received credible reports and is looking into whether
Russian forces used tear gas with chemical agents to cause strong
symptoms and incapacitate Ukrainian forces.]{.underline}**

### 2AC -- Russia Bad -- Fascism

#### Russia is a fascist regime -- who would've known!

Taras **Kuzio** **4-17**-22 Taras Kuzio is a Research Fellow at the
Henry Jackson Society and author of the recently published "Russian
Nationalism and the Russian-Ukrainian War." \[How Putin's Russia
embraced fascism while preaching anti-fascism,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/how-putins-russia-embraced-fascism-while-preaching-anti-fascism/\]//WA

When **[Vladimir Putin]{.underline}** first came to power at the turn of
the millennium, one of the main challenges he faced was the need to
repair battered Russian national pride following a decade of post-Soviet
turbulence marked by economic collapse and endless revelations of
Soviet-era crimes against humanity. Putin's solution was disarmingly
simple but brilliantly effective. He **[set out to revive Russian
patriotism by building a modern national identity]{.underline}**
**[around the Soviet Union's role in the defeat of Nazi
Germany]{.underline}**. While WWII had always played a prominent role in
shaping the national psyche, under Putin it would ascend to new heights
as the defining moment in Russian history. Far from being ashamed of
their Soviet past, **[Russians were now told that they could be proud of
belonging to a "victor nation]{.underline}**." Instead of dwelling on
the millions of innocent victims murdered during the Stalin era, they
should honor the righteous heroics of the Soviet war effort. This
veneration of the Soviet WWII experience proved hugely popular with the
Russian public. Over the past two decades, it has evolved into a
quasi-religious cult complete with its own lexicon, rituals, monuments,
and holy days. In 2020, it even received its very own
[cathedral](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/20/orthodox-cathedral-of-the-armed-force-russian-national-identity-military-disneyland).
As with any religion, heresy is not tolerated. Deviations from the
officially approved narratives of the victor nation are subject to
criminal prosecution and blasphemy is dealt with ruthlessly. In Putin's
Russia, there is no greater crime than to question the sanctity of the
Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. The kleptocratic **[Putin regime has
used this]{.underline}** [victory
cult](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/putins-russia-has-weaponized-world-war-ii/)
**[to establish the illusion of an ideological commitment to fighting
fascism]{.underline}**. In line with this anti-fascist posturing,
**[opponents of the]{.underline}** current **[Russian authorities are
routinely branded as fascists and Nazis]{.underline}**. These vague but
emotive labels have been attached to a dizzying array of adversaries
ranging from domestic dissidents to recalcitrant neighbors. Nowhere is
modern Russia's fixation with "phantom fascists" more immediately
apparent than in Kremlin policy toward Ukraine. For years, Moscow has
equated Ukrainian national identity with fascism while depicting Russian
aggression in Ukraine as a continuation of the struggle against Nazi
Germany. The Kremlin's absurd claims ignore the inconvenient reality
that today's Ukraine is a vibrant democracy with a popularly elected
Jewish president and a far-right fringe that consistently fails to
secure more than 2% in national elections. Instead, Russian audiences
are encouraged to regard the present invasion of Ukraine as an
anti-fascist crusade to rid the world of Hitler's heirs. Moscow's
efforts to portray the war in Ukraine as a battle against Nazism have
been widely mocked and comprehensively rejected by the international
community. These anti-fascist pretensions are rendered even more
ridiculous by the country's own steady descent under Putin into
full-blown fascism. Indeed, the current war in Ukraine has led many to
conclude that modern Russia is following in the footsteps of the fascist
dictatorships it claims to oppose. Defining whether a regime qualifies
as fascist is no easy matter. Indeed, as far back as 1944, George Orwell
was complaining that the word "fascism" had become "[almost entirely
meaningless](https://www.orwell.ru/library/articles/As_I_Please/english/efasc)"
and was simply used as a synonym for "bully." Nevertheless, **[most
definitions of fascism would indicate a dictatorial system of government
marked by nationalism, militarism, xenophobia, revisionism and
expansionism]{.underline}**. **[Putin's Russia unquestionably ticks all
of these boxes]{.underline}**. **[Russia completed its transition from
authoritarianism to
[dictatorship](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/03/12/the-stalinisation-of-russia)
following constitutional changes adopted in 2020]{.underline}** via a
sham referendum **[that allowed Putin to remain in power until
2036]{.underline}**. **[This confirmed his status as president for
life]{.underline}** and extinguished any lingering hopes regarding the
possibility of Russia's future democratic evolution. Since 2020,
political opposition, independent media, and all forms of public protest
have been subjected to new levels of suppression in Russia and
ruthlessly crushed. This process has accelerated in recent months as the
Kremlin has sought to silence domestic opposition to the war in Ukraine.
Draconian censorship laws have introduced criminal responsibility for
any deviations from the official government narrative of a "special
military operation" to "de-Nazify" Ukraine. Meanwhile, **[Putin's
speeches to justify the invasion have increasingly echoed the rhetoric
of twentieth century fascist regimes]{.underline}**. This has included
calls for the purification of the nation and vicious denunciations of
national
[traitors](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/03/19/russian-propagandists-turn-on-pro-western-traitors).
Throughout his reign, **[Putin has consistently mobilized toxic
nationalism as a key building block of his dictatorship]{.underline}**.
This process began in the early days of Putin's presidency when he
brought back the Soviet national anthem. It has continued to gain
momentum ever since. Following Ukraine's 2004 Orange Revolution, the
Kremlin embraced conservative nationalism as a safeguard against any
similar pro-democracy uprisings inside Russia. This led to the formation
of groups such as "Nashi," a virulently nationalistic pro-Kremlin youth
group that was widely compared to the Hitler Youth. In addition to the
aforementioned victory cult surrounding WWII, Putin has also elevated
the role of the Russian Orthodox Church in national life and promoted
the idea of Russia as a "[distinct
civilization](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/05/25/putin-and-the-distinct-russian-civilization-a70370)."
The rampant nationalism of the Putin era has been accompanied by growing
militarism fostered by everything from films and TV serials to public
holidays and the national curriculum for Russian schoolchildren. **[The
militaristic mood in the country has reflected the realities of Putin's
foreign policy]{.underline}**, with Russia at war for much of his reign.
Prior to the current full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the country had
waged a series of wars in Chechnya, Georgia, eastern Ukraine and Syria.
This
[militarism](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/03/26/the-new-russian-cult-of-war)
is now being further fanned in Russia by the use of the letter "Z" which
has emerged as a symbol of Putin's war in Ukraine after being used to
identify vehicles within the invasion force. Russians are being
encouraged to display Z's wherever possible to [show their
support](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/why-has-the-letter-z-become-the-symbol-of-war-for-russia)
for the war, with many commentators comparing the increasingly
ubiquitous letter to the Nazi Swastika. Efforts to generate popular
support for the war effort appear to be working. A recent survey
conducted by Russia's only independent pollster, the Levada Center,
found that [81%](https://www.levada.ru/2022/03/31/konflikt-s-ukrainoj/)
of Russians back the invasion. These findings are confirmed by a steady
flow of videos and posts on social media in support of the war. At the
same time, Russian anti-war protests have failed to gather any momentum
and have instead remained underwhelming. **[As Putin's Russia has moved
closer to traditional definitions of fascism]{.underline}**, **[the
regime has increasingly embraced xenophobic narratives]{.underline}**
designed **[to dehumanize Ukrainians]{.underline}** as the country's
most significant national enemy. Indeed, **[an essay]{.underline}**
published **[by Putin]{.underline}** himself in **[[July
2021](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66181) denying
Ukraine's right to exist and claiming Russians and Ukrainians are "one
people" merely put into writing the racist beliefs he has long held and
espoused]{.underline}**. In addition to depicting Ukrainians as Nazis
and extremists, Russian propaganda has long rejected the legitimacy of
Ukraine as an independent state and dismissed the entire concept of a
separate Ukrainian national identity as a foreign plot meant to divide
and weaken Russia. This anti-Ukrainian rhetoric has escalated alarmingly
in recent months. On the eve of the current war, Putin [condemned
Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/its-not-rational-putins-bizarre-speech-wrecks-his-once-pragmatic-image)
as an intolerable "anti-Russia" run by "neo-Nazis and drug addicts" and
accused Kyiv of occupying historically Russian lands. With Moscow now
facing unexpected military setbacks and suffering painful battlefield
losses, [openly genocidal
threats](https://twitter.com/JuliaDavisNews/status/1514811357178212362)
directed at Ukraine have become an everyday feature of Russia's
Kremlin-controlled mainstream media. Putin's revanchist foreign policy
goals closely fit the fascism template and directly echo the revisionist
agenda pursued by Adolf Hitler almost a century earlier. Like the Nazi
leader before him, Putin has openly expressed his desire to challenge
what he sees as the unjust verdict of a lost war. While Hitler sought to
undo the Treaty of Versailles, Putin's objective has been to reverse the
outcome of the Cold War. Both dictators have framed their expansionist
policies as sacred missions to rescue ethnic kinsfolk from artificial
separation and foreign oppression. Putin refers to the breakup of the
USSR as "the disintegration of historical Russia" and seeks to reunite
what he regards as Russia's rightful inheritance. First and foremost,
this means reconquering Ukraine. The Russian ruler has sought to justify
his aggressive foreign policy by claiming that large parts of today's
Ukraine were erroneously attached to the country by Vladimir Lenin
during the early years of the Soviet Union. In other words, the current
invasion is merely the latest and most extreme expression of Putin's
long-stated expansionist aims. The **[disastrous results of Russia's
descent into fascism are now clear for all to see.]{.underline}** In
addition to transforming Russia into a dictatorship, **[Putin has
unleashed a war of annihilation in neighboring Ukraine]{.underline}**
that both US President [Joe
Biden](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/12/politics/biden-iowa-genocide/index.html)
and his predecessor [Donald
Trump](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/3267118-trump-joins-biden-in-calling-russias-war-on-ukraine-genocide/)
have condemned as genocide. Russian war crimes in Ukraine have stunned
global audiences but the atrocities we are now witnessing should really
come as no surprise. On the contrary, **[they are the logical
consequence of a dictatorial regime that has enthusiastically embraced
nationalism, militarism, expansionism, and anti-Ukrainian xenophobia for
many years in plain sight.]{.underline}** The international community
must now urgently respond to the grave threat posed by Russian fascism
before it is too late. This means dramatically escalating sanctions
while providing Ukraine with the weapons it needs to defend itself.
Vladimir Putin pretends to be "de-Nazifying" democratic Ukraine, but it
is clearly Russia itself that requires "de-Nazification."

## 2AC -- AT: Case Turns

### 2AC -- AT: Overmatch Turn

#### Overmatch [now]{.underline} is crucial -- their evidence is outdated and doesn't assume new adversarial aggression -- harmonization of advanced equipment effectively deters Russia in Ukraine

**SSD** Soldier Systems Daily **'22**, Soldier Systems Daily is the
premier daily web publication covering the tactical industry, "The Time
Is Now For Next Generation Squad Weapons", Soldier Systems, 2/23/22,
https://soldiersystems.net/2022/02/23/the-time-is-now-for-next-generation-squad-weapons/

**[Over four years ago, then Army Chief of Staff GEN Mark Milley told
Congress that the US Army needed a new family of squad weapons which
would provide overmatch for their small arms]{.underline}**. The
**[resulting program, Next Generation Squad Weapons is ready to deliver
on that requirement]{.underline}**. **[Base on events earlier this week
in Ukraine, this program must move forward, with all
speed]{.underline}**.

[Any day now, the US Army may announce the winner to provide
replacements for up to 120,000 of the M4 carbines and M249 Squad
automatic weapons currently wielded by close combat forces]{.underline}.
The Marine Corps is monitoring the program to consider making similar
changes. This program doesn't just concern weapons, but also the
ammunition a Soldier fires. The Army specified a performance spec based
around a government provided 6.8mm projectile which is similar to 270
WSM.

The contest is now down to two very different candidates. One is a low
risk option; SIG SAUER's weapons consist of a rifle and belt-fed machine
gun which fire a hybrid-cased cartridge. Alternatively, True Velocity's
option\* is a bullpup design with box-fed rifle and automatic rifle
firing a composite-cased cartridge.

Both SIG and TV are ready to move forward, having announced commercial
variants of both their ammunition and weapons. At this point, we are
approaching COTS.

[It's time to stop the delays and announce the winner]{.underline}. [The
Army has already selected a Fire Control solution from Vortex Optics as
well as let a contract to Winchester which operates the Lake City Army
Ammunition Plant and will produce whichever type of 6.8mm cartridge is
selected]{.underline}. **[The pieces are falling into
place]{.underline}**.

Procured using an Other Transaction Agreement, there is a lot of
flexibility on how this moves forward, but it must. **[At this point,
the ball is truly in the Army's court]{.underline}**. Even after the
award, there's still a lot work to be done but the sooner it begins the
better. **[Not only does moving forward with this program get us on the
way to achieving small arms overmatch, but it sends a serious message to
Russia that US forces are equipping themselves with weapons to defeat
their ground forces in combat, regardless of their personal
armor]{.underline}**. **[This may give Russia pause in their stated goal
to restore the former republics of the USSR to Russian
control]{.underline}**. **[It will assuredly weigh on the psyche of
their troops]{.underline}**. **[Either is a psychological
win]{.underline}**.

#### Failure to pursue overmatch risks the Ukrainian missile war spreading broadly across Europe and Chinese takeover of Taiwan -- deterrence is crucial

**MDAA '22**, Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance is the only organization
in existence whose primary mission is to educate the American public
about missile defense issues and to recruit, organize, and mobilize
proponents to advocate for the critical need of missile defense.,
"Overmatch in Ukraine", MDAA, 1/28/22,
https://missiledefenseadvocacy.org/alert/overmatch-in-ukraine/

**[A DOD assessment team recently returned from Ukraine and reported
that it had found Kyiv's current missile defenses are inadequate to
defend against the advanced threat posed by Russia]{.underline}**.
Ukraine is relying on a limited number of Soviet-era S-300V missile
defense systems to counter what Ukrainian military assessments have
reported as an estimated 36 Russian Iskander missile systems have been
placed near their border. In addition, Russian S-400 air defense
batteries provide an additional defensive layer to shield their
offensive Iskander batteries from Ukrainian strike efforts. **[Russia is
overmatching and dominating Ukrainian missile defense and strike
efforts]{.underline}**.

[The Iskander is especially effective in its ability to evade missile
defense systems with decoys and a maneuverable reentry vehicle
(MaRV)]{.underline}. The Iskander-M is a short-range ballistic missile
that can be equipped with tactical nuclear weapons and became fully
operational and integrated into the Russian military in 2006. With a
range of 310 miles, the 9M723 ballistic missiles launched from Iskander
batteries have the range to strike a multitude of targets throughout
Europe and have been deployed in Kaliningrad since 2018. The Iskander-K,
Russia's cruise missile battery, is capable of delivering the
short-range 9M728 missile, as well as the long-range 9M729 which has a
range of up to 3,400 miles. **[In addition to nuclear payloads, the
Iskander can deliver missiles that deploy conventional payloads, cluster
warheads, fuel-air explosives, bunker-busters, and electromagnetic pulse
(EMP) effectors]{.underline}**.

**[This overmatch in Ukraine is indicative of the challenges that NATO
faces more broadly]{.underline}**. **[Advanced air defense capabilities
will be essential if NATO is to maintain control of the
skies]{.underline}**. Bordering Ukraine are NATO allies Poland, Romania,
Slovakia, and Hungary. Slovakia, who participates in the multinational
ground-based air defense Tobruq Legacy exercises, fields the S300PMU
long-range SAM system, the 2K12 Kub 2M tracking medium-range
surface-to-air missile system, and several 9K38 Igla2s, a man-portable
infrared homing surface-to-air missile system. While Slovakia recently
purchased Israeli multi-mission radar (MMR), the same radar used for
Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, the core of its air defense
technology relies on systems designed decades ago by the Soviet Union
and has limited capacity to defend against the advanced Russian missile
threat. Hungary's air defense capabilities are more advanced than
Slovakia's, especially following the 2020 purchase of the National
Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System-3 (NASAMS-3), yet full
replacement of the Soviet-era 2K12 Kub 2M is not expected to be complete
until 2025. Poland has made several purchases over the past decade to
improve its aging air and missile defense systems that rely on S-200,
SA-3 Goa, SA-6 Gainful, and SA-8 Gecko surface-to-air missiles systems.
Poland is expected to begin receiving two Patriot PAC-3's by 2022 and
has recently agreed to work with the United Kingdom to develop a new
Short-Range Air Defense system (SHORAD) codenamed, "Narew". Poland is
also home to the Aegis Ashore site #2, though it is behind the original
European phased adaptive approach timeline and not operational at this
time it was designed and deployed to defeat Iranian Ballistic Missiles
from Iran. Romania possesses the SA-2Guideline, S-200, and MIM-23 Hawk
air defense systems for short and medium-range air defense. Romania is
also home to a US Aegis Ashore site that too is designed and deployed to
defeat Iranian Ballistic Missiles from Iran and received its first of
seven Patriot batteries in 2020.

**[NATO's commitment to the stability of Europe is being tested, called
out, and demands cohesion and missile defense
integration]{.underline}**. **[NATO-wide integrated missile defense
systems on the border states of Ukraine will have to contain a Ukraine
Missile war and ensure it will not spread to NATO]{.underline}**.

**[The United States and its allies must be 100 percent committed and
prepared to unequivocally punish President Putin in response to a
Russian invasion, utilizing severe economic and diplomatic tools to the
maximum to ensure that Russia is completely ostracized from the
international community]{.underline}**. Given NATO's political inability
to make a significant impact in the military realm in Ukraine, every
NATO member has to unify to strengthen and exceed that punishment to
Russia through every possible channel. **[This is the deterrent that
will be measured by Russia and China for further expansion into Europe
and takeover of Taiwan]{.underline}**.​

#### Failure to deter either scenario goes nuclear -- outweighs the turn

Taiwan Could Go Nuclear", Foreign Affairs, 5/20/22,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2022-05-20/fight-over-taiwan-could-go-nuclear

**[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised the specter of nuclear war,
as]{.underline}** Russian President Vladimir **[Putin has placed his
nuclear forces at an elevated state of alert and has warned that any
effort by outside parties to interfere in the war would result in
"consequences you have never seen]{.underline}**." **[Such
saber-rattling has understandably made headlines and drawn notice in
Washington]{.underline}**. **[But if China attempted to forcibly invade
Taiwan and the United States came to Taipei's aid, the threat of
escalation could outstrip even the current nerve-wracking situation in
Europe]{.underline}**.

A recent war game, conducted by the Center for a New American Security
in conjunction with the NBC program "Meet the Press," demonstrated just
how quickly such a conflict could escalate. The game posited a fictional
crisis set in 2027, with the aim of examining how the United States and
China might act under a certain set of conditions. The game demonstrated
that China's military modernization and expansion of its nuclear
arsenal---not to mention the importance Beijing places on unification
with Taiwan---mean that, in the real world, a fight between China and
the United States could very well go nuclear.

**[Beijing views Taiwan as a breakaway republic]{.underline}**. If the
Chinese Communist Party decides to invade the island, [its leaders may
not be able to accept failure without seriously harming the regime's
legitimacy]{.underline}. **[Thus, the CCP might be willing to take
significant risks to ensure that the conflict ends on terms that it
finds acceptable]{.underline}**. **[That would mean convincing the
United States and its allies that the costs of defending Taiwan are so
high that it is not worth contesting the invasion]{.underline}**. While
China has several ways to achieve that goal, **[from Beijing's
perspective, using nuclear weapons may be the most effective means to
keep the United States out of the conflict]{.underline}**.

GEARING FOR BATTLE

**[China is several decades into transforming its People's Liberation
Army (PLA) into what the Chinese President Xi Jinping has called a
"world-class military" that could defeat any third party that comes to
Taiwan's defense]{.underline}**. China's warfighting strategy, known as
"anti-access/area denial," rests on being able to project conventional
military power out several thousand miles in order to prevent the
American military, in particular, from effectively countering a Chinese
attack on Taiwan. **[Meanwhile, a growing nuclear arsenal provides
Beijing with coercive leverage as well as potentially new warfighting
capabilities, which could increase the risks of war and
escalation]{.underline}**.

China has historically possessed only a few hundred ground-based nuclear
weapons. But last year, nuclear scholars at the James Martin Center for
Nonproliferation Studies and the Federation of American Scientists
identified three missile silo fields under construction in the Xinjiang
region. The Financial Times reported that China might have carried out
tests of hypersonic gliders as a part of an orbital bombardment system
that could evade missile defenses and deliver nuclear weapons to targets
in the continental United States. The U.S. Department of Defense
projects that by 2030, China will have around 1,000 deliverable
warheads---more than triple the number it currently possesses. Based on
these projections, Chinese leaders may believe that as early as five
years from now the PLA will have made enough conventional and nuclear
gains that it could fight and win a war to unify with Taiwan.

Our recent war game---in which members of Congress, former government
officials, and subject matter experts assumed the roles of senior
national security decision makers in China and the United
States---illustrated that a U.S.-Chinese war could escalate quickly. For
one thing, it showed that both countries would face operational
incentives to strike military forces on the other's territory. In the
game, such strikes were intended to be calibrated to avoid escalation;
both sides tried to walk a fine line by attacking only military targets.
But such attacks crossed red lines for both countries, and produced a
tit-for-tat cycle of attacks that broadened the scope and intensity of
the conflict.

For instance, in the simulation, China launched a preemptive attack
against key U.S. bases in the Indo-Pacific region. The attacks targeted
Guam, in particular, because it is a forward operating base critical to
U.S. military operations in Asia, and because since it is a territory,
and not a U.S. state, the Chinese team viewed striking it as less
escalatory than attacking other possible targets. In response, the
United States targeted Chinese military ships in ports and surrounding
facilities, but refrained from other attacks on the Chinese mainland.
Nevertheless, both sides perceived these strikes as attacks on their
home territory, crossing an important threshold. Instead of
mirror-imaging their own concerns about attacks on their territory, each
side justified the initial blows as military necessities that were
limited in nature and would be seen by the other as such. Responses to
the initial strikes only escalated things further as the U.S. team
responded to China's moves by hitting targets in mainland China, and the
Chinese team responded to Washington's strikes by attacking sites in
Hawaii.

A NEW ERA

**[One particularly alarming finding from the war game is that China
found it necessary to threaten to go nuclear from the start in order to
ward off outside support for Taiwan]{.underline}**. **[This threat was
repeated throughout the game, particularly after mainland China had been
attacked]{.underline}**. At times, efforts to erode Washington's will so
that it would back down from the fight received greater attention by the
China team than the invasion of Taiwan itself. But China had difficulty
convincing the United States that its nuclear threats were credible. In
real life, [China's significant and recent changes to its nuclear
posture and readiness may impact other nations' views, as its nuclear
threats may not be viewed as credible given its stated doctrine of no
first use, its smaller but burgeoning nuclear arsenal, and lack of
experience making nuclear threats]{.underline}. **[This may push China
to preemptively detonate a nuclear weapon to reinforce the credibility
of its warning]{.underline}**.

**[China might also resort to a demonstration of its nuclear might
because of constraints on its long-range conventional strike
capabilities]{.underline}**. Five years from now, the PLA still will
have a very limited ability to launch conventional attacks beyond
locations in the "second island chain" in the Pacific; namely, Guam and
Palau. [Unable to strike the U.S. homeland with conventional weapons,
China would struggle to impose costs on the American
people]{.underline}. Up until a certain point in the game, the U.S. team
felt its larger nuclear arsenal was sufficient to deter escalation and
did not fully appreciate the seriousness of China's threats. As a
result, China felt it needed to escalate significantly to send a message
that the U.S. homeland could be at risk if Washington did not back down.
[Despite China's stated "no-first use" nuclear policy, the war game
resulted in Beijing detonating a nuclear weapon off the coast of Hawaii
as a demonstration]{.underline}. The attack caused relatively little
destruction, as the electromagnetic pulse only damaged the electronics
of ships in the immediate vicinity but did not directly impact the U.S.
state. The war game ended before the U.S. team could respond, but it is
likely that the first use of a nuclear weapon since World War II would
have provoked a response.

[The most likely paths to nuclear escalation in a fight between the
United States and China are different from those that were most likely
during the Cold War]{.underline}. The Soviet Union and the United States
feared a massive, bolt-from-the-blue nuclear attack, which would
precipitate a full-scale strategic exchange. [In a confrontation over
Taiwan, however, Beijing could employ nuclear weapons in a more limited
way to signal resolve or to improve its chances of winning on the
battlefield]{.underline}. **[It is unclear how a war would proceed after
that kind of limited nuclear use and whether the United States could
de-escalate the situation while still achieving its
objectives]{.underline}**.

AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION

**[The clear lesson from the war game is that the United States needs to
strengthen its conventional capabilities in the Indo-Pacific to ensure
that China never views an invasion of Taiwan as a prudent tactical
move]{.underline}**. **[To do so, the United States will need to commit
to maintaining its conventional military superiority by expanding its
stockpiles of long-range munitions and investing in undersea
capabilities]{.underline}**. **[Washington must also be able to conduct
offensive operations inside the first and second island chains even
while under attack. This will require access to new bases to distribute
U.S. forces, enhance their survivability, and ensure that they can
effectively defend Taiwan]{.underline}** in the face of China's attacks.

Moreover, [the United States needs to develop an integrated network of
partners willing to contribute to Taiwan's defense]{.underline}.
**[Allies are an asymmetric advantage: the United States has them, and
China does not]{.underline}**. **[The United States should deepen
strategic and operational planning with key partners to send a strong
signal of resolve to China]{.underline}**. As part of these planning
efforts, [the United States and its allies will need to develop
war-winning military strategies that do not cross Chinese
red-lines]{.underline}. The game highlighted just how difficult this
task may be; what it did not highlight is the complexity of developing
military strategies that integrate the strategic objectives and military
capacities of multiple nations.

[Moving forward, military planners in the United States and in
Washington's allies and partners must grapple with the fact that, in a
conflict over Taiwan, China would consider all conventional and nuclear
options to be on the table]{.underline}. **[And the United States is
running out of time to strengthen deterrence and keep China from
believing an invasion of Taiwan could be successful]{.underline}**.
**[The biggest risk is that Washington and its friends choose not to
seize the moment and act]{.underline}**: a year or two from now, it
might already be too late.

**[The term "neurobiotechnology" as used in this book refers to the
application of biotechnologies in neurology]{.underline}**.
**[Technologies have been applied in medicine and neurology throughout
the history of medicine, e.g. electroconvulsive therapy]{.underline}**.
The broad term neurotechnology covers many of the devices used in
neurosurgical procedures and the term "biomedical engineering" refers to
the construction of devices such as operating microscopes and lasers as
tools for surgery.

[Biotechnology, which implies processing of materials by biological
agents to provide goods and services, has been used since World War
I]{.underline} and one example was brewing of beer. [In the
pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology has been used for application of
biological organisms in industrial manufacture of de fined products
which are mostly proteins]{.underline}. Introduction of term genetic
engineering in 1932 opened the way for application of biotechnology in
life sciences although practical tools used in modern molecular biology
had been developed at that time. Synthesis of human insulin in 1978
started the field of biotechnology-based drugs as part of
biopharmaceutical industry, which has expanded from a few drugs in the
1980s to 131 FDA-approved biotech (protein/peptide) drugs and 900 are in
development including 44 for neurological disorders.

**[Biotechnologies relevant to human health are shown in Table 1.1 and
will be described in later chapters]{.underline}**. **[Historical
landmarks in the development of biotechnologies for human health are
shown in Table 1.2]{.underline}** . Recombinant DNA is an important
method that is used to make alterations to an organism's genome, usually
causing it to over- or under-express a certain gene of interest, or
express a mutated form of it. The results of these experiments can
provide information on that gene's role in the organism's body.

**[Molecular Neurology]{.underline}**

[The term "molecular neurology" has been increasingly used during the
past decade as a further stage in the evolution of classical neurology,
which was based on clinical features of neurological disorders
supplemented with diagnostic imaging of the nervous system,
eletrophysiological studies and neuropathology]{.underline}. Information
obtained from application of new technologies to study of the nervous
system has enabled elucidation of the pathomechanism of the disease as
well as targeting therapy at molecular level. **[Genetics, genomics and
gene therapy are examples of some of the topics covered when dealing
with diseases of the nervous system]{.underline}**. However, there has
been no systematic description of the biotechnologies and their
application in neurology.

**[Molecular Neuroscience]{.underline}**

[Molecular neuroscience is easier to de fine as a branch of neuroscience
that examines the biology of the nervous system with molecular biology
techniques]{.underline}. **[Biotechnologies have been used for the study
of basic neuroscienses such as molecular neurophysiology, molecular
neuroanatomy, etc]{.underline}**. Detailed descriptions are given in
several books that focus on methods and protocols used in neuroscience
research, which is done predominantly in animal models. [The focus of
this book is on technologies that are relevant for clinical
neurology]{.underline}. **[Applications of biotechnologies that are
relevant to clinical neurology along with relevant basic sciences will

### 1AR -- AT: T -- Biotechnology

#### Neurotechnology is just [one]{.underline} of the biotechnical advancements of the Fourth Industrial Revolution

Klaus **Schwab '18**, is founder and executive chairman of the World
Economic Forum, "The Fourth Industrial Revolution", Britannica, First
Edited 5/25/18,
https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Fourth-Industrial-Revolution-2119734#ref1255192

Like the First Industrial Revolution's steam-powered factories, the
Second Industrial Revolution's application of science to mass production
and manufacturing, and the Third Industrial Revolution's start into
digitization, [the Fourth Industrial Revolution's technologies, such as
artificial intelligence, genome editing, augmented reality, robotics,
and 3-D printing, are rapidly changing the way humans create, exchange,
and distribute value]{.underline}. As occurred in the previous
revolutions, this will profoundly transform institutions, industries,
and individuals. More importantly, this revolution will be guided by the
choices that people make today: the world in 50 to 100 years from now
will owe a lot of its character to how we think about, invest in, and
deploy these powerful new technologies.

[It's important to appreciate that the Fourth Industrial Revolution
involves a systemic change across many sectors and aspects of human
life: the crosscutting impacts of emerging technologies are even more
important than the exciting capabilities they represent]{.underline}.
**[Our ability to edit the building blocks of life has recently been
massively expanded by low-cost gene sequencing and techniques such as
CRISPR; artificial intelligence is augmenting processes and skill in
every industry; neurotechnology is making unprecedented strides in how
we can use and influence the brain as the last frontier of human
biology; automation is disrupting century-old transport and
manufacturing paradigms; and technologies such as blockchain and smart
materials are redefining and blurring the boundary between the digital
and physical worlds]{.underline}**.

#### Neurotechnologies are biological augmentations to the brain -- that *[is]{.underline}* biotechnology

Irene **Jarchum '19**, Associate Editor of Nature Biotechnology, "Focus
on neurotechnologies", Nature Biotechnology, Vol. 37, 9/4/19,
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0261-5.pdf

[Neurotechnologies have come far in just a few years, and we can expect
them to provide new approaches to shed light on brain function and
contribute novel therapeutic interventions]{.underline}. In basic
neuroscience, a diversity of molecular approaches are enabling
researchers to track and manipulate the activity of specific neuronal
populations in the brain and peripheral nervous systems of freely moving
mice, and single-cell 'omics' is allowing profound characterization of
brain cells, which will provide a finer understanding of neuroanatomy
and function in health and disease. In animal models, a range of
exciting electrical, chemical and optical tools continue to emerge,
serving as fundamental tools for neuroscientists and informing study
design in humans (see Review by Frank et al.).

[In the clinic, although surgical and small-molecule approaches
traditionally have provided treatments for neurological and psychiatric
disorders, these remain blunt therapeutic instruments, often accompanied
by considerable side effects in return for limited
efficacy]{.underline}. Today, electrode arrays allowing the recording
and stimulation of neurons with a high degree of precision are being
engineered to be flexible and soft, injected into deep-brain structures
with a syringe, and connected to decoders and actuators. This is opening
new opportunities for restoring lost function by allowing control of
robotic arms in quadriplegia patients. [Deep brain stimulation,
meanwhile, is an effective treatment for common movement disorders,
including Parkinson's disease, but is not without side
effects]{.underline}. Although next-generation electrodes provide
spatial and temporal control, which could enable precise stimulation, an
incomplete understanding of underlying disease processes prevents
clinicians from taking advantage of these engineering feats (see Review
by Cagnan et al.).

[Insights into brain function are emerging from electrodes temporarily
implanted into patients that report on electrical signals from the
cortex]{.underline}. **[Biocompatible tissue-like electronics report on
brain function from deep structures and are poised to provide long-term
readouts of brain activity as well as a therapeutic avenue for chronic
disease]{.underline}** (see Perspective by Patel and Lieber).

A vast number of patients could benefit from precision therapies for
psychiatric and neurological diseases, and an improved mechanistic
understanding of brain connectivity and function is key to support their
development and application (see Editorial). **[Brain--computer
interfaces best exemplify the type of strategies that are likely to
become more broadly used in the coming
years]{.underline}**---**[implanted devices record brain signals, which
are decoded using complex algorithms and translated into actions using
prosthetics]{.underline}** (see News Feature by Smalley). Brain--machine
interfaces have been successfully piloted in a couple of dozen
individuals, and the field is pushing on towards safer and better
systems (see Patent Table).

### 1AR -- AT: T -- Biotechnology -- Human Enhancement/Performance Optimization

#### HPE/HPO of soldiers falls under biotechnology

Cdr Dr. Christian **Haggenmiller '21**, German Institute for Defence and
Strategic Studies, "Human Performance Optimization and Enhancement",
Multinational Capability Development Campaign (MCDC), 3/22/21,
https://gids-hamburg.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-03-22_MCDC_HPEO_Project_Report_final-1.pdf
**\*HPE/HPO = Human Performance Enhancement/Optimization**

[In the previous paragraphs the terms HPA, HPO, HPE, HPR and HPD were
introduced and will now be summarized in short and concise
definitions]{.underline}. Common to all terms is that they consider a
change in a human's performance in both the positive/increasing and
negative/decreasing directions. The relation between defined terms is
shown in the diagram in Error! Reference source not found. [We have
chosen the term Human Performance Modification as an umbrella term that
includes all other terms. HPA covers both HPO and HPE, which are
positive developments of performance, and therefore shown in
green]{.underline}. HPR, which has no intersection with HPA, is also
positive in performance development, and thus shown in green. HPD,
however, does not intersect with the other terms and has negative
performance development, hence represented by red color. • **[Human
Performance Modification: Active and passive change of an individual's
level of performance. While Human Performance Modification usually
focuses on optimization and enhancement, we include both Human
Performance Degradation and Human Performance
Restoration]{.underline}**. • **[Human Performance Augmentation: HPA is
the application of science and technologies to temporarily or
permanently improve human performance]{.underline}**. This field can be
further divided into Human Performance Optimization and Human
Performance Enhancement. • **[Human Performance Optimization: The
process of applying existing and emerging science and technology to
individuals allowing them to reach their biological
potential]{.underline}**. • **[Human Performance Enhancement: The
process of applying existing and emerging science and technology to
individuals allowing them to exceed the biological potential of the
individual]{.underline}**. • Human Performance Restoration. Return to
baseline when performance has degraded below baseline. The focus here is
on restoration from degradation caused by illness, injury, exhaustion,
side effects, violence, or coercion. • Human Performance Degradation.
Decrease in performance below previous levels resulting from four
principal sources. It can be explained by factors such as reduced
biophysical skills or capacity through \[1\] fatigue, exhaustion; \[2\]
diseases, injuries; \[3\]system safety issues, degraded system
functionality of prior optimization or enhancement; or \[4\] actions by
hostile externally based technologies, platforms or systems. [The
possible process to achieve HPA relies on interventions such as adapted
training, appropriate diets, pharmacology, implants, prostheses, and
genetic modifications. Use of equipment, even if it is not intrusive in
the body, may require a cognitive modification. Hence, some nations may
consider that equipment is part of HPA while others may consider
equipment as out of scope]{.underline}. The view in this note is that
equipment is closely linked to the body and thus part of HPM. In the
course of an individual's life, values such as the current physiological
performance level (baseline) or the biological potential change,
sometimes considerably. Figure 2 shows a standardized representation of
lifetime in which the definitions of the different performance types
have been inserted. [We recognize that group or unit performance relies
not only on the individual reaching the minimal standard needed for task
performance but also on appropriate assessment and selection of the
individual for the task and engaged leadership. How this can be applied
in the military context will be discussed]{.underline} in chapter 11 --
HPM Assessment of Future Scenarios.

## 2AC -- AT: T -- Security Cooperation

### 2AC -- AT: T -- Security Cooperation

#### All of the aff's actions fall under security cooperation -- they are all [actions geared towards increasing effectiveness]{.underline} of the alliance 

The Joint Chiefs of Staff **JCS '17**, is the body of the most senior
uniformed leaders within the United States Department of Defense, that
advises the president of the United States, the secretary of defense,
the Homeland Security Council and the National Security Council on
military matters, "Security Cooperation", Joint Publication 3-20,
5/23/17,
https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/Doctrine/pubs/jp3_20_20172305.pdf

The basic nature of war has not changed, but the character of conflict
has evolved to include increasingly transregional, multi-domain, and
multi-functional (TMM) threats. [**Security cooperation (SC) activities
are as likely to be conducted as an element of contingency operations as
they are in a combatant command's (CCMD's) daily operations.** TMM
challenges will cut across multiple CCMDs, across land, maritime, air,
space, and cyberspace]{.underline}. The strategic environment is fluid,
with changing alliances, partnerships, and national and transnational
threats that rapidly emerge, disaggregate, and reemerge. These factors
will demand efficient planning efforts and the sound application of
intelligence in concert with the other joint functions to address the
uncertainty and ambiguity of future strategic and operational
environments (OEs) and will significantly affect how the joint force
conducts SC. **[SC strengthens and expands the existing network of US
allies and partners, which improves the overall warfighting
effectiveness of the joint force and enables more effective
multinational operations]{.underline}**.

a\. **[SC provides ways and means to help achieve national security and
foreign policy objectives]{.underline}**. [Department of Defense (DOD)
strategic guidance emphasizes the importance of defense relationships
with allies and partner nations (PNs) to advance national security
objectives, promote stability, prevent conflicts, and reduce the risk of
having to employ US military forces in a conflict]{.underline}. **[SC
activities, many of which are shaping activities within the geographic
combatant commanders']{.underline}** (GCCs') **[theater campaign
plans]{.underline}** (TCPs), **[are deemed essential to achieving
national security and foreign policy objectives]{.underline}**.
Accordingly, **[Department of Defense Directive (DODD) 5132.03, DOD
Policy and Responsibilities Relating to Security Cooperation, requires
SC activities to be planned, programmed, budgeted, and executed with the
same high degree of attention and efficiency as other DOD
activities]{.underline}**.

b\. **[SC encompasses all DOD interactions, programs, and activities
with foreign security forces]{.underline}** (FSF) an**[d their
institutions to build relationships that help promote US interests;
enable PNs to provide the US access to territory, infrastructure,
information, and resources; and/or to build and apply their capacity and
capabilities consistent with US defense objectives]{.underline}**. **[It
includes, but is not limited to, military engagements with foreign
defense and security establishments]{.underline}** (including those
governmental organizations that primarily perform disaster or emergency
response functions), **[DOD-administered security assistance (SA)
programs, combined exercises, international armaments cooperation, and
information sharing and collaboration]{.underline}**. Rather than a
hierarchical relationship, SC, in its numerous forms, has an overarching
functional relationship with all other associated programs, activities,
and operations.

c\. [SC activities are the products of strategic guidance and certain PN
requirements determined through collaboration among the combatant
commanders]{.underline} (CCDRs), [their components, the Military
Departments]{.underline} (MILDEPs), [and applicable chiefs of
missions]{.underline} (COMs). **[The Under Secretary of Defense for
Policy (USD\[P\]) disseminates the Secretary of Defense's]{.underline}**
(SecDef's) **[SC guidance, which has been coordinated with the
Department of State]{.underline}** (**[DOS]{.underline}**). **[USD(P)
also leads the review of GCCs' TCPs, including their countryspecific
security cooperation sections]{.underline}** (CSCSs)/**[country plans,
to ensure that they are aligned with policy, objectives, and priorities,
and are resource-informed]{.underline}**. SC programs and activities are
integrated into the TCPs and executed through the CCMDs,
Services/special operations forces (SOF), and the security cooperation
organizations (SCOs), and with the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
(DSCA) providing certain management, accounting expertise, and delegated
oversight. SC activities are coordinated with DOS and other applicable
interagency partners at the department level and through their country
team members. SC planning is discussed in detail in Chapter III,
"Security Cooperation Planning."

2\. Security Cooperation Purposes

a\. As summarized above, [SC helps develop partnerships that encourage
and enable PNs to act in support of aligned US strategic
objectives]{.underline}. [SC activities often complement other United
States Government (USG) foreign assistance to provide stability, help
mitigate drivers of conflict, and assure key partners and
allies]{.underline}. **[Effective execution of SC enables PNs to carry
out missions in lieu of, or alongside, US forces]{.underline}**.
Additionally, [SC supports US military campaign and contingency plans
with necessary access, critical infrastructure, and PN support; and
enables the achievement of strategic objectives, such as deterring
adversaries, preventing conflict, and enhancing the stability and
security of PNs]{.underline}. **[SC also benefits the US military
through theater and sociocultural orientation that improves readiness
for training and advising FSF]{.underline}**.

b\. SC resource investments in programs and activities are driven by
scoped and prioritized campaign objectives and guidance in SecDef's
Guidance for Employment of the Force (GEF), the Joint Strategic Campaign
Plan (JSCP), and certain objectives in each COM integrated country
strategy (ICS). Those objectives are consolidated in the TCP and the
CSCSs/country plans nested within the TCP. The TCP and CSCSs/country
plans implement that strategic guidance and articulate the desired PN
roles in one or more of three categories.

\(1\) Apply Capacity and Capabilities. **[As our national policy
acknowledges, the US will rarely conduct unilateral military
operations]{.underline}**. [Capability refers to the PN's ability to
execute a given task while capacity refers to the PN's ability to
self-sustain and selfreplicate a given capability]{.underline}.
**[Building partner capacity and capabilities through SC requires a
long-term mutual commitment to improve PN capacity and capabilities in
support of US strategic objectives]{.underline}**. For example, the PN:

\(a\) Joins a US-backed multinational force. (b) Deploys a peacekeeping
force to support a United Nations (UN) or another international
organization mission. (c) Builds counterterrorism (CT) capacity to
counter local and transnational terrorist networks. (d) Conducts
personnel recovery (PR) or foreign disaster relief (FDR) with regional
neighbors to include chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear
(CBRN) incident response activities. (e) Counters the ability of
transnational criminal organizations and their associated networks to
conduct illicit activities through the country. (f) **[Pursues mutually
beneficial objectives and/or increased interoperability with the US and
multinational forces]{.underline}** ([e.g., increase capacity for
ballistic missile defense, develop undersea warfare capability, or
expand irregular warfare capabilities]{.underline}). (g) Supports US
countering weapons of mass destruction (CWMD) efforts.

\(2\) [Provide Access. National security requires the US to maintain
operational access across the globe]{.underline}. Operational access
promotes flexibility in the US defense posture, provides freedom of
movement, and supports freedom of action during military operations.
**[Access also facilitates other means of support to include
information/intelligence sharing and technology]{.underline}**. [SC
activities promote the PN's willingness to provide various types of
military access that supports US strategic requirements in a
theater]{.underline}. **[For example, the PN]{.underline}**:

\(a\) Provides a forward basing agreement, including access,
permissions, and overflight to sovereign territory, airspace,
territorial waters, bases, and facilities (e.g., a secure port or
airfield) to include enabling host nation (HN) reception and onward
movement distribution processes. (b) **[Shares information on internal
security challenges]{.underline}**. (c) Provides permission for entry of
US forces through a defense cooperation agreement, diplomatic note, or
status of forces agreement with USG. (d) **[Shares resources and
technology via DOD international armaments cooperation
programs]{.underline}**. (e) **[Supplies intelligence in support of US
intelligence requirements]{.underline}**. (f) **[Provides access to a
training facility for US military forces]{.underline}**. (g) Coordinates
the use of HN electrical power, fuels, and other sources of energy in
support of US SC activities and joint operations. (h) **[Signs an
acquisition and cross-servicing agreement]{.underline}** (ACSA) **[to
enable logistics process integration and
interoperability]{.underline}**.

### 1AR -- AT: T -- Security Cooperation -- Interoperability

#### Interoperability is not just employment of new tech into training operations -- it spans the whole production process

Cdr Dr. Christian **Haggenmiller '21**, German Institute for Defence and
Strategic Studies, "Human Performance Optimization and Enhancement",
Multinational Capability Development Campaign (MCDC), 3/22/21,
https://gids-hamburg.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-03-22_MCDC_HPEO_Project_Report_final-1.pdf
**\*HPE/HPO = Human Performance Enhancement/Optimization**

[The nature of HPA may entail clear risk of silo effect with respect to
technological development and operational use]{.underline}. **[One
purpose of the MCDC collaboration is to work for interoperability, which
means, among other things, developing common concepts]{.underline}**.
**[Interoperability does not manifest by itself; on the contrary,
targeted activities are needed on several levels]{.underline}**. Figure
4 illustrates in a nutshell how national and international activities
take place in parallel as the technology readiness level increases. Each
step up in the pyramid requires an active measure to maintain the
opportunity for interoperability at the next level. [The
interoperability concept with respect to human augmentation relies on
recognition of the content associated with each step and definition of
activities that must take place]{.underline}. **[This involves anything
from making an inventory of where we are technically, where our interest
and focus lie, as well as recognizing differences in use, legislation,
and acceptance between nations]{.underline}**. Although Figure 4 is
based on a bottom up perspective, the outcome does not end with
utilization. In practicality, both utilization and threat generate need
for further development and the sequence starts all over. In the context
of HPA, there are many different opportunities and possible directions
for interoperability. Starting at the lowest level and working the way
upwards: • Questions for the first level are "what is the next thing and
what should we concentrate on?". The lowest level pertains to common
understanding based on shared knowledge and assessments of emerging
technologies and future potential for HPA utilization. The effort is
facilitated by established common definitions such as stated in section
3 of this note. • [The second level deals with those "hard" requirements
that are a prerequisite for realization of interoperability and have to
be built into the systems. Typically, this level stresses the need for
common interfaces that enable compatibility, such as physical and
electrical standards. This need has been addressed by multiple NATO
efforts, EDA and other initiatives]{.underline}. For instance, specific
programs have been looking at standardization of soldier systems (STASS,
GOSSRA) which has many parallels to the wearables that are in discussion
for HPA. Standards and recommendations developed within MCDC could
support interoperability. • [The third level focuses on "how to do
things". For instance, the versatility in MCDC participating
organizations and defense forces with respect to materiel, education and
training means that it is difficult to compare results and experiences.
The goal is to identify common metrics and tools for assessment of
augmentation effect]{.underline}. Part of that is to share methods and
work towards building a larger common body of knowledge. • [The highest
level deals with "how well does it actually work and what are the
issues?". At this stage, there are experiences from operational usage
and the goal is to share lessons learned and define best
practices]{.underline}. **[Interoperability on this level depends on
established agreements and policies between the participating
organizations]{.underline}**. This project has initiated work aimed at
identifying the various forms of interoperability that apply to HPA
development and use. [An important part of the continuing effort is to
determine the level of ambition per technology area and application.
There is also a need for a way to manage and administer the body of
knowledge that is being built up over time]{.underline}.

#### Interoperability over HPE/HPO is a form of biotechnical collaboration

Cdr Dr. Christian **Haggenmiller '21**, German Institute for Defence and
Strategic Studies, "Human Performance Optimization and Enhancement",
Multinational Capability Development Campaign (MCDC), 3/22/21,
https://gids-hamburg.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-03-22_MCDC_HPEO_Project_Report_final-1.pdf
**\*HPE/HPO = Human Performance Enhancement/Optimization**

[Optimization programs follow a holistic approach which includes body,
mind, social, and ethical performance]{.underline}. Successful HPO
programs depend on many factors, including biological, physical,
psychological, cultural, and social ones, all of which interact.
[Well-planned HPO programs will give service personnel knowledge,
skills, and access to emerging technologies to improve and preserve the
capabilities needed to execute mission essential tasks]{.underline}.
**[A personalized approach to performance optimization should be
emphasized when improving enhanced operational readiness of
soldiers]{.underline}**. There is a wide range of programs with major
focus on HPO, although some HPE programs are being established.
Unfortunately, information on these projects was not available or
detailed enough to draw conclusion about the "must have capabilities".
It is assumed that many programs contain sensible information, which
prevent them from being shared in the large MCDC community. [Most
technologies in use (fielded) can be found in the HPO realm, while HPE
technologies are still immature or restricted in use]{.underline}. The
technologies described will find applications in different areas where
the timeframe for realization will depend on numerous factors. For
instance, the expectation is that the largest potential will be found in
a combination of techniques. [Although biological and genetic
engineering are not part of current military programs, there should be
awareness of new aspects and developments. We nee d to understand what
may be feasible in the future]{.underline}. [Programs with focus on
wearable biosensors and physiological status monitoring are already part
of many research projects run by the various participators in
MCDC]{.underline}. The analysis of collected biodata is both a data
quality problem and a big data problem that today requires bespoke
systems. [Further development is warranted to find sensor (monitoring)
systems that are sufficient for military requirements in the field with
respect to signal transduction, artefacts, built-in quality assessment,
and security]{.underline}. The history part of this note touched on the
detrimental consequences that can arise when interventions are used in
an improper manner. At the same time, it is important to seize the
potential of already present as well as emerging remedies. Thus, effects
and side effects of performance enhancing drugs must be studied to get
the answers to the questions what, when and how much/long stimulants can
be used to enhance service personnel performance without harming the
individual. **[Interoperability relies on common understanding and
standards, information flow, interaction principles, strategies, system
safety and logistics]{.underline}** -- **[aspects that are necessary for
efficient collaboration]{.underline}**. For example, different views and
legislation regarding the use of potent drugs may generate an
interoperability issue. **[It is therefore necessary to use and develop
concepts that are inclusive but at the same time as diverse as deemed
necessary]{.underline}**. **[According to our survey, there are no
multinational initiatives that aim to increase the interoperability of
combined or joint operations]{.underline}**. **[Instead, the focus
clearly is on isolated individual/small units]{.underline}**.

2017, still accessible online under the link
http://www.defnat.com/e-RDN/ cahiers-de-la-RDN.php, [the CREC Saint-Cyr
gives us a definition of the enhancement of the combatant under the
terms]{.underline}: "[Enhancing a soldier is the action of
rendering]{.underline} him/her \[[them]{.underline}\] [more efficient
during military operations by strengthening or optimizing intellectual
skills]{.underline} (mental, psychological, cognitive to assist in
decision making help or perception) [and/or physical abilities (to

to enhance performance]{.underline}**; • [Using non-therapeutic
substances or using static dynamic implants]{.underline} (nanomaterials,
prostheses) [or applying suitable gene therapeutic
treatment]{.underline}; • [For short or long-term use that can even be
irreversible provided its effects are controlled]{.underline}. **[By
efficiency we mean operational efficiency. In other words, an
individual's capacity to achieve results in fulfilling a mission. This
definition is intentionally broad in scope and unrestrictive to
encompass enhanced performance derived from different
techniques]{.underline}**."1

for? They are intended]{.underline}**: a) [first and foremost for each
combatant to remain operational, to reduce danger, to improve and then
to maintain over time his reflexes and automatisms as a combatant in
order to survive]{.underline}; b) [for the basic combat unit that is the

others]{.underline} (avoid deterioration of collective know-how,
maintain the pace of the manoeuvre, remain attentive to the requirement
for internal liaison); c) [for the leader, to enable

## 2AC -- AT: CPs

### 2AC -- DOD Key -- Top Level

#### The DoD's expertise and government oversight are key to combating [national security threats]{.underline} affecting biotechnology.

Accessed 6-23-2022; RL\]

Stephanie Rogers, the Defense Department's acting principal director for
biotechnology, recently declared that "[the nation that leads the world
in biotechnology will accrue enduring economic, societal, and defense
gains]{.underline}." Unfortunately, this awareness has yet to be
reflected in government policy. [Biotechnology security is **national
security**]{.underline} --- for the United States and for China. [The
Department of Defense should recognize biotechnology's role as a
**foundational technology** and make biotechnology development and
supply chain security a priority]{.underline}.

Maintaining America's Biotechnology Advantage

[Biotechnology in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[is]{.underline} a [significant]{.underline} contributor [to the
economy]{.underline}. By one estimate, in 2017, [U.S. biotechnology
revenues exceeded **\$400 billion**, or 2 percent of gross domestic
product, substantially surpassing better-measured sectors such as
mining]{.underline}. Bioeconomy [revenues have grown at an average rate
of **10 percent** annually for two decades]{.underline}. Notably, [U.S.
biotechnology revenues]{.underline} alone [were]{.underline}
approximately [equal to worldwide semiconductor revenues]{.underline}
for 2017. Biotechnology now supplies critical medicines, and, as more
than 90 percent of the corn and soy grown in the United States is
genetically modified, biotechnology feeds the armed forces. [Industrial
biotechnology is responsible for upward of **20 percent** of chemicals
produced in the United States]{.underline}, suggesting a similar
proportion of chemicals used in the military are also biologically
derived. And these impressive figures may still be significant
underestimates: Using a different methodology, the U.S. National Academy
of Sciences recently concluded that the biotechnology industry
contributes 5 to 7 percent of U.S. gross domestic product.
[Biotechnology, therefore, may already constitute an even larger share
of the **military supply chain**.]{.underline}

As [biotechnology]{.underline} continues to mature, its [contribution to
**physical** and **economic security** will become even more
**significant**. Tools are]{.underline} now [being deployed that enable
the **engineering** and **biomanufacturing** of materials that will
eventually not only displace **petrochemicals** but also surpass them in
**production** **scale** and **performance**]{.underline}. Over the next
ten to twenty years, biological production could soon supply up to 60
percent of physical inputs across the global economy, and biotechnology
could have a "direct economic impact of up to \$4 trillion a year."

While [the United States]{.underline} is arguably still leading in
biotechnology, it [risks losing]{.underline} this [lead to
China]{.underline}. In China, biotechnology is a national development
and a security matter. [China's Innovation Driven Development Strategy
emphasizes biotechnology's essential role in the country's economic
development]{.underline}, while the Military-Civil Fusion Development
Strategy seeks to ensure that biotechnology research is also oriented
toward the country's military and broader security goals. [Chinese
biotechnology revenues are reported to be of a similar size to those in
the United States, although they are subject to even lesser clarity in
reporting.]{.underline}

While China continues its licit and illicit acquisition efforts
targeting the U.S. biotechnology sector, it is also shifting its
attention to domestic innovation. In time, this will provide the
People's Liberation Army with new capabilities and increase both
America's and the Pentagon's reliance on Chinese biotechnology products.

Recommendations

As early as 1958, the Department of Commerce was tracking the economic
contribution of semiconductors, even though they made up less than 0.1
percent of the gross domestic product. Yet, today, [the U.S. government
has made no equivalent effort to track]{.underline} the much more
significant role of [biotechnology]{.underline}.

[This]{.underline} ~~illiteracy~~ [\[lack of tracking\] is a national
security issue. American and Chinese bioeconomies are in
competition]{.underline}, and Beijing asserts that it is investing with
the intent to take, and to then maintain, the lead. [To sustain
America's advantage, the **U.S. Department of Defense** should better
understand its **reliance** on **biotechnology** and **increase
investment**]{.underline} in it accordingly. The [Pentagon's recent
investment in the BioIndustrial Manufacturing and Design Ecosystem is a
notable step in the right direction]{.underline}. However, the
seven-year budget for this project is approximately the cost of a single
F-35A. For an investment that could impact the entire defense supply
chain, this is inadequate.

We recommend the following plan of action for the Department of Defense
to take its place alongside the Departments of Commerce and State in the
broader interagency effort to secure America's biotechnology advantage.

First, in close coordination with the Department of Commerce, [the
Department of Defense should make a systematic effort to better
understand the role of biotechnology in the economy, supply chains, and
manufacturing. This]{.underline}, in turn, [should inform additional
**oversight** and **regulatory controls**]{.underline}.

The responsibility to understand, prepare for, and respond to
biotechnology threats is balkanized, spread across at least nine
departments and agencies. [Vulnerabilities in the bioeconomy will affect
the Department of Defense in terms of readiness, soldier health, and the
ability to fulfill missions. Addressing those vulnerabilities begins
with]{.underline} a sustained, compr[ehensive effort to understand the
role of biotech]{.underline}nology [in industry]{.underline} today, as
well as how that industry contributes to defense supply chains, and how
military acquisition policy shapes biotechnology. To that end, the
Pentagon should work with the Department of Commerce to create domestic
reporting codes for biotechnology revenues and employment for the
quarterly and annual economic census, and further incorporate those
codes into the North American Industrial Classification System.
Institutionalizing the gathering of these data is the first step toward
sustainable policymaking and rational spending.

The Department of Commerce should then consider adding import/export
controls on biotechnology, while avoiding overly broad restrictions that
suffocate innovation. Protecting foundational technologies using the
Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act and Export Control
Reform Act will be critical for securing biotechnology. However,
biotechnology competition is not exclusive to commercial activities.
[The **Pentagon** should assess **critical vulnerabilities** and
**dependencies** to assist the other agencies in bringing China's
foreign biotechnology access in line with standards in other major
markets]{.underline}.

[The Department of Defense has]{.underline} been asked [to document and
secure supply chains critical to defense applications and to the overall
U.S. economy. This should also apply to biotechnology]{.underline}.
Current Pentagon efforts to expand domestic biological manufacturing
capabilities are an important start, but a broader effort is needed. An
empowered deputy national security adviser could help oversee the
relationship between the Pentagon and the National Economic Council to
promote and secure the military's broader technology needs.

Second, [the **Department** of **Defense** should better study the
accomplishments and intent of China, especially the Chinese
**military**, in developing **biotechnology**]{.underline} as a
strategic technology.

Once the Department of Defense better understands critical U.S.
biotechnology dependencies on China, it can begin the work of reducing
them. This requires an interagency examination to identify cross-cutting
resources, develop mitigation strategies, formulate best practices to
bolster innovation, and expand outreach to allies and partners to reduce
systemic gaps China could exploit. Partnership with industry and allies
will allow the U.S. government to understand and counter Beijing's
efforts to distort commercial activity in its favor.

To this end, the Department of Defense should mirror the National
Security Council's effort by creating an emerging technology portfolio
within Office of the Under Secretary of Defense-Policy. While other
technology offices in the Department of Defense are internally focused,
an entity in this office that concentrates externally on foundational
technology competition is required. Such an office may be able to
address uncertainties in assessments of Chinese biotechnology revenues
and capabilities.

Finally, in coordination with the Department of State, [the **Department
of Defense** should identify **opportunities** for **dialogue** with the
People's Liberation Army about **biotechnology-related security**
issues]{.underline}.

It is time to include [**biotechnology** in the dialogue mechanisms that
compose bilateral U.S. defense relations with the People's Liberation
Army.]{.underline} This dialogue [should prioritize the **ethics** of
biotechnology in the context of future conflicts, the **escalatory
risks** this technology creates, and the possibility of cooperation
where the interests of the two nations intersect]{.underline}. [Both
sides should]{.underline} work toward a common understanding related to
ethics, policies, and standards when operationalizing biotechnology.
This will help [avoid **miscalculation** and promote **strategic
stability**]{.underline}.

Unlike the U.S. government, Chinese leadership has a carefully
considered position on the importance of biosafety and "biological
problems" in national security. While these problems are understood to
encompass traditional weapons concerns, they also extend to the health
of the entire natural world in the context of ever-expanding
applications of biotechnology. This position might provide an
opportunity for constructive engagement at a time when tensions are
rising.

Conclusion

The Pentagon needs to expand its approach to biotechnology beyond
biodefense. If China maintains biological warfare aspirations, by all
means address those. But defense planners should also address China's
broader approach to biotechnology and its integrated approach to
civil-military fusion.

Securing biotechnology secures the nation. [Maintaining the U.S. lead in
biotechnology is critical to the nation's economic and military
resilience]{.underline} in war, peace, and the gray zone short of
conflict. [This requires better biotechnology collaboration --- within
the U.S. government, with allies and partners]{.underline}, and even,
where possible, with competitors.

#### The DoD's [access to]{.underline} and [standards on]{.underline} critical resources make it a [leader]{.underline} in [global]{.underline} biotechnology supply chains.

Unlike a commercial company or an academic research hub, [the DoD is
motivated by a mission to **project** **power** on a **global
scale**]{.underline}. Its [obligations to maintain a warfighting force
structure, to protect its military industrial infrastructure, and to
sustain a persistent situational awareness of global events carries with
it unique motivators and priorities]{.underline}. Few would argue that
[the converging fields of **artificial intelligence**, **automation**,
and **synthetic biology** are creating opportunities that will
fundamentally change the battlefield of the future]{.underline}. The
convergence of these fields is creating what has been termed the fourth
industrial revolution--- namely, the biological revolution. In order
[for the United States to harness the value proposition offered by the
fourth industrial revolution, it needs to resolve]{.underline} 2
challenges: [ensuring a reliable, robust, and secure domestic supply of
materials and goods]{.underline}, and addressing the inherent
incompatibility between traditional DoD acquisition processes and the
commercial biotechnology landscape.

**[Supply of Materials]{.underline}**

Historically, [the United States has been a **leader** in advances in
the biological sciences]{.underline}, and [the ability to meaningfully
engineer biology is driving rapid innovation in biotechnology and
growing a robust industrial US bioeconomy]{.underline}. Other [countries
are **aggressively investing** in similar capabilities, with the
**goal** of dominating this **fourth industrial revolution**.
Maintaining **competitiveness** and ensuring the **security** of the
domestic **bioeconomy** is thus vital to maintaining the **economic
health**]{.underline} of the United States. As well, the [**bioeconomy**
has important implications for the US defense industrial base, which has
been steadily declining in recent decades]{.underline}.10 The 2017
National Security Strategy delineates the importance of a stable and
reliable industrial supply chain[: A healthy defense industrial base is
a critical element of U.S. power and the National Security Innovation
Base. The ability of the military to **surge** in response to an
emergency depends on our Nation's ability to produce **needed parts**
and **systems**, **healthy** and **secure** **supply chains**, and a
**skilled** U.S. **workforce**.]{.underline}11 In response, the White
House issued Presidential Executive Order 13806 on ''Assessing and
Strengthening the Manufacturing and Defense Industrial Base and Supply
Chain Resiliency of the United States.''12 Last year, [a report in
response to the executive order]{.underline}13 [highlighted specific
concerns that were echoed by the Pentagon's own annual study of domestic
defense capabilities]{.underline}, which stated, ''[long-term trends
continue to threaten the health of the industrial base, limit
innovation, and reduce U.S. competitiveness in the global
markets]{.underline}.''14

These studies emphasize the current reality that construction and
resupply of many fielded defense systems are vulnerable to sole source
suppliers in Asia and Europe, and existing domestic suppliers are
fragile or nonexistent. [Defense leadership must accept that
biomanufacturing represents an untapped and affordable alternative to
bolster domestic capacity]{.underline}. Today's technology can minimize
reliance on expensive petrochemical production and provide a flexible
bio-based alternative if [the defense enterprise can mobilize to invest
in and craft the proper coalitions]{.underline}. Creation of reliable,
robust, and secure domestic supply chains could be supported in a number
of ways.

[The **DoD** **should** **continue** with efforts to establish a
**Manufacturing Innovation Institute** under the MANTECH office in the
Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).]{.underline} This effort is
the cornerstone of the associate director for biotechnology and is part
of an overall modernization strategy to build a defense biotechnology
ecosystem. [That biotechnology ecosystem will focus on pursuing
**breakthrough technical capabilities**, building a **domestic core
capacity**, securing the **related data** as a **strategic operational
resource**, and shaping a **biotechnology-capable manufacturing** and
**acquisition process**]{.underline}.

Through the efforts of the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Industrial Policy, which seeks to ensure secure, resilient,
and innovative industrial capabilities on which the DoD can rely in an
era of great power competition, [the **DoD** is **bolstering efforts**
to ensure the **secure supply** of critical chemicals used in DoD
systems. A **focused effort** from this office to use authorities
granted to it under its Title III program would]{.underline} contribute
to [sustain]{.underline}ing [**defense bioeconomy** **initiatives** and
support policy outlined in Executive Order 13806]{.underline}, 2019 NDAA
language, [and upcoming legislation]{.underline}.15

[The DoD should]{.underline} continue its [support]{.underline} for the
[**development** of **standards** and **measurement tools** to break
bottlenecks in scale-up **production** and
**commercialization**]{.underline}. These areas have become prominent
risks [for]{.underline} [**advancement** of the **US
bioeconomy**]{.underline}.16 [**Standards** and **measurements** are
necessary components of **approaches** and **best practices** that lead
to the **consolidation** of successful **industry platforms** that can
**perform** at scale]{.underline}. Not only are [standards required for
the physical cellular components of the scale-up process]{.underline},
but [standard ways of depicting and describing engineered constructs in
computational language are needed]{.underline}; just as [a common
language is used to represent electronic circuits]{.underline}, a
similar standard will need to be developed for engineered biological
circuits. [The **DoD** is already taking a **lead** on the **potential
development** of **manufacturing standards**,17 which will go far to
advancing the US bioeconomy writ large]{.underline}---namely, reducing
the risk taken on by industry.

Finally, serious vulnerabilities regarding the security of the US
bioeconomy exist in the area of protecting innovations and securing
supply chains from adversaries such as China. Not only were these issues
highlighted in the White House report, but they have also been
demonstrated, from the level of academic research misconduct,18 through
industrial espionage.19 [Through the **DoD contractor certification**
**process**, best practices should be developed by the US **bioeconomic
industrial base**---not only to ensure secure supply chains, but also to
ensure secure intellectual property and corporate surety protections on
many levels (**financial**, **physical**, **cyber**, and
**personnel**/**insider** **threats**]{.underline}).

Biodefense and Synthetic Biology In 2016, [the D]{.underline}epartment
[o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense, in conjunction with other
agencies charged with protecting the USA against attack, [commissioned a
study]{.underline} from the NASEM [to advise them on the vulnerabilities
posed by advances in biotech]{.underline}nology. The study report was
published in May 2018 (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine 2018). [DoD asked the committee to develop a framework to guide
an assessment of the security concerns related to advances in synthetic
biology]{.underline}, to assess the levels of concern warranted for such
advances, and [to identify options that could help mitigate those
concerns]{.underline} (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine 2018). The framework developed by the committee is a
qualitative tool that posits four major factors to consider in assessing
any given threat: (1) ease of use of the technology; (2) capability of
actors; (3) potential to weaponize; and (4) mitigation capabilities. For
each attribute, a series of considerations and questions were presented
to assist in the analysis. The three [main conclusions]{.underline} of
the National Academies study may be summarized as follows: (1)
[Synthetic biology expands what is possible for misuse, and
biotechnology is advancing rapidly; (2) some malicious applications may
not seem possible now, but are only limited by specific technical
bottlenecks and barriers, which could be overcome with further
biotechnology progress; and (3) the framework described in the report is
a useful tool for analyzing and prioritizing potential biosecurity
concerns, particularly in the light of new biotechnology advances which
may raise biosecurity concerns.]{.underline} The committee applied its
framework to twelve potential concerning capabilities that it deemed to
be enabled by synthetic biology tools---e.g., making a known virus more
virulent, disrupting the human immune system, making a known pathogenic
bacteria from synthesized components, or creating an entirely novel
pathogen. For each, the committee assessed the four factors regarding
the ease of use of the technology, the capability of actors, the
potential to weaponize, and potential for mitigation capabilities as
they relate to those capabilities, and determined how each of the
capabilities ranked relative to each other with respect to how much
concern the committee had. Rather than attempting to predict when new
capabilities might come about, which would make the report a static
document which would be immediately outdated, the committee noted a
series of bottlenecks and barriers that exist currently. The committee
explained how types of advances in technology and/or knowledge might
allow those bottlenecks and barriers to be overcome, which would
increase the likelihood of a potential threat. The committee suggested
that [DoD]{.underline}, the sponsor of the study, as well as other
organizations [responsible for biodefense, should monitor advances in
the field with an eye toward these advances that directly affect the
bottlenecks and barriers, as those could allow new types of threats for
which defenses would need to be prepared]{.underline}. Does
Biotechnology Pose New Catastrophic Risks? 109 The following sections
focus on a handful of capabilities which are similar or identical to
those included in the NASEM study, relating them more generally to
global catastrophic risk.

BIO-INSPIRED DEFENSE APPLICATIONS: IN SEARCH OF STRATEGY AND SECURITY
[Over the last several years, the DOD has tried to create nimbler ways
of acquiring emerging tech]{.underline}nologies - not only to address
mission needs, but also [to keep pace and maintain parity with our
adversaries worldwide]{.underline}. To enable rapid funding and attract
innovators not traditionally engaged with DOD challenges, the Defense
Innovation Unit (DIU)26 was created in Silicon Valley, with a second
innovation hub created specifically to benefit from proximity to
biotechnology companies in Boston.27 Another hub in Tampa, SOFWERX, is
intended to create new acquisition models for innovations that benefit
special operators.28 These efforts have produced some promising
contracts for drones, cyber technology, machine learning, and an
exciting warfighter exoskeleton. However, [biotech]{.underline}nology
[prototypes have yet to emerge from]{.underline} these
[incubators]{.underline}.29 An Army Futures [Command]{.underline} is
launching soon in Austin, TX, but as of this writing, it [does not
include biotech]{.underline}nology as [one of its \"futures\"
technologies]{.underline}.30 That noted, [the DOD has developed a
promising internal program devoted to synthetic biology]{.underline}
across its service laboratories - the Applied Research for the
Advancement of Science and Technology Priorities Program on Synthetic
Biology for Military Environments, or ARAR31 [A USD 45 million
investment over three years is intended to explore]{.underline} novel
organisms for metabolic engineering, and to grow
[biotech]{.underline}nology [expertise within the DOD]{.underline}
research and development labs. Expertise is also supported by the Open
Campus exchange program, [whereby military scientists can be embedded at
cutting-edge synthetic biological institutions]{.underline} and
companies, such as MIT, Gingko Bioworks, and CalTech. The ARAP hopes to
[develop new biologically-based sensors, materials, and
biotech]{.underline}nological [solutions for
**warfighters**]{.underline} - [such as transparent armor, responsive
camouflage, conductive nanomaterials, biofuels, and optimized,
**engineered human microbiomes**]{.underline}. The program has been
successful, but as it approaches its third and final year, [**next steps
are unclear**, given the **lack of** a **strategic framework** for how
DOD will adopt biotech]{.underline}nology [writ large]{.underline}. As
noted at the 2018 Global Bioeconomy meeting, almost fifiy countries were
pursuing a national bioeconomy at the beginning of the year, and many
are forming strategies and implementation plans to harness the
benefits.32 In China, the governments push for biotechnological
innovation spans both civilian and military arenas, with biotech
featured in their most recent five-year plan. It stipulates the
biotechnology sector goal as exceeding 4 percent of gross domestic
product by 2020, with an output surpassing CNY 10 billion (USD 1.5
billion). Thus far, the Chinese government investment in biotech already
exceeds USD 100 billion,33 incuding investment in U.S. companies.34 It
is estimated that the Chinese contribute 43 percent of U.S.
biotechnology venture capital, with the intent to assume global control
of the industry.35 In the United Kingdom, a Synthetic Biology Leadership
Council (SBLC) was founded to steer the progress of emerging
biotechnology, beginning with a roadmap developed in 2012 that helped to
build needed infrastructure.36 It was followed by a more comprehensive
strategy in 2016, entitled \"Biodesign for the Bioeconomy.\"37 The
strategy focuses on goals such as accelerating industrialization and
commercialization, creating an expert workforce, and developing a
supportive business environment. More importantly, the SBLC maintains a
governance group tasked with making risk-benefit assessments of
technologies, forming relevant regulations and policies, and monitoring
public attitudes and international trends.38Still, [neither the DOD nor
the broader U.S. government has a biotech]{.underline}nology or
synthetic biology [strategy in place today]{.underline}. In 2012, a
bioeconomy blueprint was written to encourage advancement of a U.S.
bioeconomy, which by design did not include biosecurity considerations,
so as not to diminish enthusiasm for a promising component of the U.S.
economy.39 This document encouraged unfettered innovation as the
industry was developing, but it is already outdated as security concerns
have steadily grown. [An updated U.S. bioeconomy strategy could support
biotech]{.underline}nology [innovation across **all**
sectors]{.underline}, and [incorporate codes of conduct and
norms]{.underline}, encouraging promising developments [while addressing
potential security concerns]{.underline}. It could ensure transparency,
build public trust, and potentially offer guidance on responsible
conduct for research and industry as the field evolves. It could also
allow for coordinated government investments, avoid redundancies, and
create standards needed to advance the field. Compelling models for
success exist: for example, the National Nanotechnology Initiative
supports the societal benefits of nanotechnology research and
development across twenty U.S. departments and independent agencies.40
One might dispute the usefulness of a directive national strategy, given
the already substantial investment of American venture capital in
synthetic biology, and the benefits of an open field for unimpeded
innovation. Still, [reaffirming biotech]{.underline}nology [as a
national priority]{.underline} could, in the least, [ensure continued
U.S. competitiveness]{.underline} in the growing international
bioeconomy. **[More urgent is a DOD-specific strategy for synthetic
biology]{.underline}**. Distinct from its role in space or missile
technologies, [DOD is not driving biotech]{.underline}nology
[innovation]{.underline}, and furthermore, [DOD has not fully
assessed]{.underline} its biotechnology [needs]{.underline}. Outside of
traditional force health protections and the development of medical
countermeasures, what advantages over adversaries could biotechnology
provide? What unique DOD challenges and problems are best met with
biotechnological solutions versus other emerging technologies? These
questions have yet to be addressed as the industry races forward. There
may be an appetite amongst synthetic biology companies to partner with
DOD, [but without a clear understanding of DOD s needs, companies are
unlikely to reallocate time and effort away from purely commercial
pursuits]{.underline}. **[DOD]{.underline}** also **[needs a strategic
plan for acquiring biotech]{.underline}**nology. Since World War II, the
defense industrial base has steadily hollowed out, with fewer companies
able to provide increasingly DOD-centric goods.41 The DOD is plagued
with aging facilities, the import of single-source supplies from
overseas, and burdensome supply chains.42 There are so many critical
single points of failure for some components that the Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford, warned the U.S. Senate
that such a \"brittle\" industrial base may fail the United States in
international crises.43 These [shortcomings will hamper the adoption
of]{.underline} new, useful [biotech]{.underline}nologies[. For example,
body armor created from spider silk]{.underline} could provide
lightweight flexibility and durability for warfighter armor, but spiders
cannot produce silk at commercial grade or scale. The bioengineering of
silk worms to spin \"dragon silk\" is a promising advance, and might
provide a solution to DOD\'s body armor production.44 However, silk
worms subsist on mulberry leaves, and require over 6,000 acres of
mulberry trees to produce at scale. The current plan is to utilize
farming cooperatives in Vietnam, relying upon international contracts,
embassy approvals, a burdensome supply chain, and a potential
single-source point of failure - thereby perpetuating the challenges of
the defense-industrial base.45 A different problem is exemplified by
resveratrol resin, engineered from a natural chemical found in red
grapes. It could be used to make lighter drones, flame-resistant engine
casings, or high performance jet fuel, but bio-based materials will not
be incorporated into military products if they are not considered in
acquisition requirements. The chairman\'s concerns about the industrial
base has spurred two evaluative studies focused on identifying problems
and their potential solutions - one by the Eisenhower School at National
Defense University,46 and another by the Trump administration in
response to an executive order. The latter report described the
uncertainty of federal spending, unintended consequences of U.S.
government acquisition behavior, and [the loss of skills in the domestic
workforce as \"unprecedented\" challenges facing DOD
manufacturing]{.underline}.47 These same challenges discourage synthetic
biology companies from working with DOD. Still, the [adoption of
biotech]{.underline}nologies [is not without **risk**]{.underline}. As
we create and innovate with bio-based materials and sensors, each new
system must be assessed for ways they can be attacked or compromised.
Under what conditions should dragon silk armor replace Kevlar? What are
the chinks in dragon-silk armor that an adversary could take advantage
of? The same is true of coatings, sensors, and other materials: they may
have uniqueweaknesses that should be weighed against their benefits.
Finally, the [use of synthetic biology]{.underline} to enhance the
performance of warfighters [must be carefully considered - including the
potential for adversaries to use biotech]{.underline}nology to [enhance
their own]{.underline} or others\' [warfighters]{.underline}.48 **[A DOD
strategy could work to meet these challenges, and prioritize goals for
its synthetic biology programs]{.underline}**. It could [help DOD strike
a balance between absorbing successful commercial products \"off the
shelf,\" versus setting requirements for biotech]{.underline}nology
[products and building them from the bottom up]{.underline}. Both
approaches still **[need a plan for the technologies\' incorporation
into the force]{.underline}**. As the ARAP has already created a locus
of expertise, it could provide a logical hub to steer biotechnology
within DOD. The ARAP has forged collaborative partnerships with DARPA,
DIU, the Chemical and Biological Defense Program, external academic
centers, and a wide range of synthetic biology industrial leaders. The
ARAP could pivot in its final year to [charting a strategic path forward
across DOD for the development and implementation of emerging
biotech]{.underline}nology, while assessing its risks and
vulnerabilities. Creating a \"Community of Interest\" could be a
distinct advantage in getting biotechnology to the battlefield.
Regardless of strategic approach, some key questions should be
considered: ■ What specific challenges and solutions does each
biotechnology offer DOD? \* What risk-benefit frameworks should be used
to assess the benefits of novel biological materials, sensors, or human
elements and their potential vulnerabilities? m How should technology
innovation hubs best be utilized to encourage biotechnology advances? \*
What industry partnerships and innovative acquisition models should DOD
use to adopt biotechnology? \* How should the possibility of human
enhancement, or human degradation by adversaries, be ethically assessed?

Recommendations

Moving forward, we recommend that the U.S. government conduct additional
national security gaming to further assess the operational risks and
benefits of BCI technology in combat, including provisions for
additional domains and contingencies. Beyond operational risks, [the
government will need to address a potential lack of trust in BCI
technologies]{.underline}, which is an issue that emerged during the
game as a potential impediment to adoption by the armed services.
[This]{.underline}, in turn, [requires special attention to how BCI is
deployed as it matures. Our review]{.underline} of current technological
progress [highlighted work done in academic and private-sector
laboratories]{.underline}, and [the U.S. government should]{.underline}
seek to [leverage work in both]{.underline}, [especially as the
commercial sector increasingly dominates technology R&D.]{.underline}
Developing and deploying [BCI technologies in the national security
sector will require institutional adaptation]{.underline} to operators
at each stage of the process. Next, we offer some concluding suggestions
on each of these points.

[**Expand Analyses** to Illuminate Operational Relevance and
Vulnerabilities]{.underline} Over the coming decades, [it will be
critical that operational needs and risks]{.underline}, [rather
than]{.underline} just [technical opportunities]{.underline}, [drive BCI
development.]{.underline} To help support this need, we developed a
systematic approach to evaluating the potential operational applications
of BCI and other over-the-horizon military technologies. During the TTX
testing, pairing of operational experience with technological expertise
yielded rigorous and fruitful discussions, and this process should be
replicated on a larger scale. [These]{.underline} approaches could
[supplement existing internal exercises, such as the Marine Corps
Advanced Naval Technology Exercise, to explore the practical utility of
BCI and other prospective technologies to future
warfighters]{.underline}. By incorporating a disruptive and creative Red
team of RAND experts, the game also highlighted potential new areas of
operational vulnerability, as well as initial ideas to mitigate them. As
the U.S. government seeks to build resilience from early phases of BCI
development, similar methods could help to unearth the full range of
adversary threats. [Beyond BCI]{.underline}, the
**[approaches]{.underline}** developed in this pilot project [**are
scalable** and **could be applied to a variety of emerging
technologies**.]{.underline}

**[Address the Trust Deficit]{.underline}** One major theme to emerge
from the study was that **[cultural barriers to BCI]{.underline}**,
[particularly among infantry service members, are]{.underline} likely to
be [high]{.underline}, and [this is]{.underline} a [common]{.underline}
theme [with many]{.underline} new and [emerging
technologies]{.underline}. [These barriers can be mitigated]{.underline}
with the following steps. As [BCI]{.underline} capabilities are
integrated into the force, they [may initially be more readily accepted
among]{.underline} [service members who already rely]{.underline}
heavily [on machine technologies]{.underline}, and who experience
greater requirements for direct interaction with computers or machines.
During the R&D process in the coming decades, [noninvasive measures are
less likely to encounter cultural resistance. They may also be easier to
reverse and control]{.underline}. Similarly, work on [medical or
therapeutic applications]{.underline} may [offer near-term
benefit]{.underline} for today's wounded warriors and is likely to
encounter the least cultural resistance. Unsurprisingly, service members
are more likely to trust capabilities that have been appropriately
vetted and tested before use. Thus, once BCI capabilities are further
developed, [robust testing for failure in noncombat
scenarios]{.underline}, [including training and data processing and
analysis]{.underline}, [before introducing them into combat]{.underline}
[will]{.underline} help to [strengthen trust and reduce]{.underline} the
potential for [unanticipated risk.]{.underline}

**[Collaborate and Anticipate]{.underline}** Research for this project
highlighted multiple examples in which **[DoD seed funding for
BCI]{.underline}** laboratory **[research yielded
successes]{.underline}**. Significant future [advances]{.underline} may
[take place in the **private sector**]{.underline}, and [the U.S.
government should]{.underline} seek to **[leverage private-sector
R&D]{.underline}** [when possible]{.underline}. If carefully pursued,
[private-sector advances]{.underline} may also **[improve trust
gaps]{.underline}** [within the military]{.underline}: [As the U.S.
public begins to use BCI, there may be less skepticism about its use in
a national security setting.]{.underline} As [private-sector
technology]{.underline} advances and [begins to be applied to the
military sphere]{.underline}, [**International Traffic in Arms
Regulations, Export Administration Regulations, and other restrictions**
should be considered]{.underline} [with respect to BCI]{.underline}.
**[BCI intellectual property]{.underline}** [should be]{.underline}
carefully **[monitored by DoD]{.underline}** and the Department of
Commerce [during]{.underline} these [early]{.underline} periods of
[development]{.underline}. As emerging technology accelerates, it
becomes increasingly important to consider integrated systems and how
[different technologies depend on one other]{.underline}. [BCI could
prove an important tool for integrating human-machine
systems]{.underline}, whether by enhancing big data analysis,
accelerating accurate decisionmaking, or improving the control of
exoskeleton, drone swarms, or semiautonomous systems. However, [there is
a risk that]{.underline} the [research could occur in
isolation]{.underline} [without consideration of]{.underline} additional
and [related emerging technologies]{.underline}. Thus, current
[development efforts should make provisions for the]{.underline}
[eventual availability of BCI, even if its applications are currently
still in the basic-research phase.]{.underline}

**[Plan Ahead for BCI Institutional Implications]{.underline}** As the
U.S. government prepares to incorporate BCI technologies into future
military capabilities, appropriate [institutional planning
will]{.underline} help to [ensure a smooth rollout and
execution]{.underline}. It is important to [consider **ethical and
policy issues** before emerging technologies mature]{.underline} and are
disseminated. [During]{.underline} the [research]{.underline} phase, it
will be important to continue to [integrate ethical, legal, and societal
considerations]{.underline} into research funding. [DARPA]{.underline}
currently [requires]{.underline} that research teams conduct [ethical
analysis]{.underline} for many grants [surrounding BCI]{.underline}.
Rigorous [internal analysis should continue **beyond basic research**
throughout]{.underline} the [development]{.underline}, [design, and
application]{.underline} of new BCI technologies [for defense and
national security use]{.underline}. [The U.S. government
should]{.underline} continue to [implement]{.underline} [National
Academy of Sciences ethical recommendations]{.underline} in development
and implementation, particularly [regarding]{.underline} (1) questions
of **[consent]{.underline}** that are specific to service members, (2)
potential **[health implications]{.underline}** for invasive BCI, (3)
considerations surrounding **[enhanced human performance]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} (4) potential risks to **[privacy]{.underline}**. As
BCI technologies are disseminated across national security institutions,
[services]{.underline} [will want to identify]{.underline} clear
**[oversight mechanisms]{.underline}** [for BCI development and
application]{.underline}. Given the broad range of potential
applications for BCI, [there is significant risk of **stovepiping** with
related R&D]{.underline}. A [department-wide oversight]{.underline}
mechanism, potentially [residing in the Office of the Secretary of
Defense]{.underline} or the Joint Staff, [should track and review BCI
developments for senior DoD approval]{.underline}. Once BCI is
integrated into services, [individual services might
consider]{.underline} coordinated [arbitration mechanisms **outside the
chain of command** to allow service members]{.underline} and their
commanding officers [to]{.underline} discuss or [object to unethical or
harmful uses of BCI technology]{.underline}. Finally, [DoD may
need]{.underline} to plan for a range of [additional warfighter and
veteran care needs after]{.underline} the incorporation of
[BCI]{.underline} technologies. BCI carries the potential for new
dimensions of care requirements, potentially [including BCI withdrawal,
brain injuries, posttraumatic stress disorder, and ongoing care for
invasive devices through Veterans Affairs.]{.underline}

In cyberpunk fiction, people routinely "jack in" to cyberspace ---
linking their electrode-enhanced brains, or "wetware", directly to
computers. That future is getting closer, the RAND Corp. says, with
"brain-computer interface (BCI)" technology poised to begin moving from
labs to operational military applications. "In general, with emerging
technology there is always a struggle to predict the future --- and
that's just not possible. **[BCI is not]{.underline}** just **[science
fiction]{.underline}**; [it has viable]{.underline} practical
[applications]{.underline}, but there is much more work that needs to be
completed before it becomes mainstream and commercial," Tim Marler, one
of the co-authors of the study, Brain-Computer Interfaces: U.S. Military
Applications and Implications, An Initial Assessment, told Breaking D in
an interview. Marler and study co-authors Anika Binnendijk and Elizabeth
Bartels say that while [the emergence of BCI comes with a whole host of
potential **benefits for military operations**, it also opens up huge
**technical, ethical and legal risks.**]{.underline} "It's good to [put
attention on this emerging subject]{.underline}, since what's been
[science fiction is now becoming reality]{.underline}," Patrick Lin, a
philosophy professor at California Polytechnic State University, and a
member of the Center for a New American Security's Task Force on AI and
National Security, said in an email. "The [ethics]{.underline} of
brain-computer interfaces [is a huge subject]{.underline}, given the
nature of the technology and its potential," he added. "It's not just a
merger of hardware and wetware, but also [the collision of technology
ethics and traditional bioethics]{.underline} that **[hasn't been
handled well so far by industry or regulators."]{.underline}** The RAND
study is based on the "premise that [human-machine teaming will play a
**major role in future combat**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} that [BCI
may provide a competitive advantage in future warfare]{.underline}."
[BCI could enable seamless **human-machine teaming**]{.underline};
[increased **speed** of decision-making for command and control of a
hyperconnected battlefield; enhanced human **endurance** during combat;
and improved **medical care** for wounded vets, says the study, released
today.]{.underline} In particular, it could help forward human-machine
teaming by helping humans: "Digest and synthesize large amounts of data
from an extensive network of humans and machines; Make decisions more
rapidly due to advances in AI, enhanced connectivity, and autonomous
weaponry; Oversee a greater number and types of robotics, including
swarms." seminal cyberpunk novel Neuromancer by William Gibson predicted
in 1984, BCI could even allow humans to directly connect to the Internet
--- in effect becoming another node in the Internet of Things (IoT).
"DoD believes [IoT can contribute to improved readiness]{.underline} by
allowing one to monitor the status of materiel and weapons systems in
real time, and it is thus becoming pervasive. IoT has tactical
applications, including [giving warfighters access to sensors and data,
and BCI could enhance this ability]{.underline}," the study says.
[Risks]{.underline} from the use of BCI [are monumental]{.underline}.
**[Technical risks]{.underline}** could [range from the ability to jam
human-machine networks; to enemies hacking into the "jacked in" brains
of US soldiers via cyber attacks causing confusion or even physical
harm.]{.underline} "As with many new technological developments, BCI may
create new military operational vulnerabilities, new areas of ethical
and legal risk, and potentially profound implications for existing
military organizational structures," the study says. Potential
[vulnerabilities could include]{.underline} "the potential for new
[points of failure]{.underline}, [adversary access to new
information]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} new areas of exposure to
[harm or]{.underline} avenues of [influence]{.underline} of service
members," the study explains. [Institutional risks include]{.underline}
"challenges surrounding a **[deficit of trust]{.underline}** [in BCI
technologies]{.underline}, as well as the [potential **erosion of unit
cohesion**]{.underline}, **[unit leadership]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} other critical **[interpersonal military
relationships]{.underline}**." **[Ethical questions]{.underline}** [are
myriad]{.underline}. In extremis, to use another example from science
fiction, [militaries]{.underline} or intelligence agencies [could create
'**mind controlled' suicide bombers**]{.underline}. But more [routine
ethical challenges are also serious]{.underline}, the study says, such
as how can [**DoD ensure** against any long-term mental or physical
**side effects**]{.underline} from such technology? [Who is
**accountable**]{.underline} is something goes wrong? Another issue is
what happens [when an BCI-enhanced warfighter retires]{.underline}?
[Does the technology]{.underline}, asks Jonathan Moreno, a professor of
bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, [have to be
removed]{.underline} after a soldier retires or leaves the service? How
might that affect veterans? "To what extent should the military be
worried about removing something, taking something away, when you are no
longer the force?" he asked. "[Do Super Soldiers ever die]{.underline},
or just fade away?" The RAND study sums up: "BCI can likely be useful
for future military operations, even in the most difficult test case:
infantry ground force combat. This utility may become particularly
pronounced once technology for military applications of AI and robotics
develops further, and once adversaries have access to these
capabilities. Nonetheless, [the application of BCI would **support
ongoing DoD technological initiatives**]{.underline}, including
human-machine collaboration for improved decision-making, assisted-human
operations, and advanced manned and unmanned combat teaming. Of course,
as with most significant technological advances, [there are potential
risks. BCI falls subject to the capability-vulnerability
paradox]{.underline}, with counterweighted benefits and risks, and, as
[development efforts and eventual acquisition efforts progress,
requirements will need to account for such risks]{.underline}." [RAND
recommends]{.underline} that the Pentagon move forward now to develop [a
research and development strategy that integrates ethical considerations
up-front]{.underline}. The study recommends: "[Assess the operational
risks and benefits of BCI technology in combat. "Address a potential
lack of trust in BCI technologies prior to adoption by the armed
services. "Work with academic and private-sector laboratories to
leverage private-sector advances in BCI and improve trust gaps within
the military. "Plan for institutional implications and address new
ethical and policy issues at each stage of the process, from research
and development, to operational application, to veteran
care."]{.underline} As Breaking D readers know, [the Air
Force]{.underline} in particular [is enthusiastic about human-machine
teaming whereby piloted aircraft and AI-driven drones are seamlessly
linked for air combat operations]{.underline}. Development projects
include Air Force acquisition czar Will Roper's high-priority
[Next-Generation Air Dominance]{.underline} (**[NGAD]{.underline}**)
[effort to rethink a **sixth-generation fighter**]{.underline}, [and
the]{.underline} **[Skyborg program]{.underline}** [to develop an
a]{.underline}rtificial intelligence-base brain for "loyal wingman"
drone being managed by Air Force Research Laboratory.
**[DARPA]{.underline}** [and the Army]{.underline} also have [funded
research]{.underline} at University of Delaware's Human-Oriented
Robotics and Control laboratory to enable a user to control a swarm of
drones. According to RAND, the lab's "researchers suggest the technology
could be used practically in the military within five to ten years.
Applications also include delivery of medical help, search and rescue,
and exploration, all in remote or inaccessible environments." Up to now
work by the [military services has largely focused on the machine
aspect]{.underline}, rather than on the human one. This includes on the
question of ethics. As Breaking D readers know, [DoD's Defense
Innovation Advisory Board]{.underline} in October 2019 [put out a report
listing five ethical principles applying to military AI
research]{.underline}. And just last month, as Kelsey reported, the
Intelligence Community issued a similar set of principles for ethical AI
development. [DARPA]{.underline}, on the other hand, [has been
increasingly focused on the human side]{.underline} of manned-machine
teaming, [as well as other potential uses for BCI]{.underline}. As
Sydney wrote way back in 2017, the Biological Technologies Office is
exploring whether a weapon system could respond to a human's brain cells
forming the intention to control it. In probably the most famous DARPA
experiment so far, in 2015 [a quadriplegic woman flew an
F-35]{.underline} in a simulator [using only her brain.]{.underline} As
the RAND study notes, DARPA is also a key player in the 2013 National
Institutes of Health (NIH) initiative started by the Obama
Administration called Brain Research through Advancing Innovative
Neurotechnologies (BRAIN). BRAIN, designed to improve understanding of
the human brain, also includes the National Science Foundation, the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Intelligence Advanced Research
Projects Agency (IARPA), as well as foundations, institutes,
universities, and biotech industries. Related to [BRAIN]{.underline} is
Neural Engineering System Design (NESD), which "[aims to develop an
implantable neural interface able to provide unprecedented signal
resolution and data-transfer bandwidth between the brain and the digital
world]{.underline}." This DARPA program has two sub-projects: "Towards a
High-Resolution, Implantable Neural Interface," and "Bridging the
Bio-Electronic Divide." The planned budget for NESD is NESD is \$88.469
million, DARPA spokesperson Jared Adams told Breaking D today "[DARPA is
committed to exploring the ethical, legal, and societal implications of
potential, future human applications of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)
technologies]{.underline}," he added. The RAND study was based in large
part on a July 2018 tabletop exercise involving military warfighters and
neuroscientists. "We found that our [initial discussions on BCI
technologies were **overly abstract**]{.underline}. So we projected
forward to consider what these breakthroughs in the laboratory setting
might tangibly mean for the future warfighter. With this notional
"toolbox," we could then have a more grounded analysis of the potential
risks and benefits of the future technology," Binnendijk told Breaking
D. The exercises and research led RAND to focus on several areas where
BCI tools could be useful for military applications: [Human-machine
decision-making "involves transferring data to the human brain from
sensor input and from the brain to machines. ... This kind of tool
allows a warfighter to digest more information faster, to be used, for
example, with theater assessment or risk and threat assessment.
Warfighters ultimately can increase over- all reaction time, thus
**collapsing the OODA loop**]{.underline}." [Human-machine direct system
control "involves allowing warfighters to **control systems** with their
thoughts wirelessly, as well as to **supervise** semiautonomous and
**AI** systems, including robots, drones, drone swarms, or jets. ...
This, in turn, provides the warfighter increased situational awareness
and again helps collapse the OODA loop." Human-to-human communication
and management "entails wirelessly transmitting commands or basic ideas
among warfighters and commanders, lightening the load of communications
systems. It could facilitate immediate **and silent communication** of
plans or tactics on the battlefield, or improve communication with
headquarters to enhance commanders' awareness of in-theater
conditions]{.underline}." [Monitoring performance "would enable
awareness of group or individual emotional, cognitive, and physical
states. ... thus **detecting** when a person is **fatigued**, paying
**attention**, has high or low **cognitive workload**, or is
significantly **stressed**." Enhancement of cognitive and physical
performance "includes improving a warfighter's cognitive and physical
states on the battlefield." Cognitively, it could "yield **enhanced
focus, alertness** for rapid and improved situational awareness and
decisionmaking." Physically, it could enhance the senses, such as
hearing; enable **pain mitigation**; or **improve strength** "through
more efficient integration with mechanical exoskeletons, which are
natural extensions of the work on prosthetics." Training via BCI "could
**improve** operator **learning and memory** processing, allowing
warfighters to retain more information."]{.underline}

The field of [neuroethics has had to adapt rapidly in the face of
accelerating technological advancement]{.underline}; a
[particularly]{.underline} striking example is the realm of
[Brain-Computer Interface (BCI]{.underline}). [A significant source of
funding for the development of new BCI]{.underline} [technologies has
been the **United States Department of Defense**,]{.underline} and
[while the]{.underline} predominant [focus has been **restoration of
lost function** for those wounded in battle, there is also significant
interest in **augmentation** of function to **increase survivability,
coordination, and lethality of US combat forces**]{.underline}. While
restoration of primary motor and sensory function (primary BCI) has been
the main focus of research, [there has been marked progress
in]{.underline} interface with areas of the brain subserving [memory and
association]{.underline}. [Non-Primary BCI]{.underline} has a different
subset of potential applications, [each]{.underline} of which also
[carries its own ethical considerations]{.underline}. [Given
the]{.underline} amount of [BCI research funding coming from the
Department of Defense, it is]{.underline} particularly [important
that]{.underline} potential [military applications be examined from a
neuroethical standpoint]{.underline}.

[Military imperatives have driven **medical advances** and allowed for
rapid implementation and evaluation of new practices]{.underline}
(Beekley et al., 2007; Haider et al., 2015). [Many]{.underline} of these
advances [can]{.underline} then [be **applied to civilian
practices**]{.underline}, [yielding additional dividends]{.underline} on
the often considerable investment underpinning their
[development]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} development of
[resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta]{.underline},
for example, [shows how]{.underline} [dedication of]{.underline} the
[military]{.underline}'s [resources]{.underline} to rapidly
[solv]{.underline}ing [an urgent problem]{.underline} ([in this case
battlefield fatalities]{.underline} due to non-compressible thoracic or
pelvic bleeding) [can significantly accelerate the development and
deployment of new technologies for **wartime and peacetime
applications**]{.underline} (Rasmussen and Eliason, 2017). The field of
[neuroprosthetics and]{.underline} brain computer interface
([BCI]{.underline}) [is another area where]{.underline} a [significant
funding]{.underline} pool [has come from Department of Defense
sources]{.underline}, [in particular the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA)]{.underline} (Miranda et al., 2015). [This
presents]{.underline} [a]{.underline}n area of **[significant
opportunity for national defense]{.underline}** and also human
neuroscience; [it also raises **several**]{.underline} [potential
**ethical issues** that should be explored before the technology has
already transitioned t]{.underline}o the domain of [military
application.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} U.S. Department of Defense (**[DoD) has invested
in]{.underline}** the development of technologies that allow the human
brain to communicate directly with machines, including the development
of implantable neural interfaces able to transfer data between the human
brain and the digital world. This technology, known as brain-computer
interface (**[BCI]{.underline}**), may eventually be used to monitor a
soldier\'s cognitive workload, control a drone swarm, or link with a
prosthetic, among other examples. Further technological advances could
support human-machine decisionmaking, human-to-human communication,
system control, performance enhancement and monitoring, and training.
[However, numerous policy, safety, legal, and ethical issues should be
evaluated before the technology is widely deployed]{.underline}. With
this report, the authors developed a methodology for studying potential
applications for emerging technology. This included developing a
national security game to explore the use of BCI in combat scenarios;
convening experts in military operations, human performance, and
neurology to explore how the technology might affect military tactics,
which aspects may be most beneficial, and which aspects might present
risks; and offering recommendations to policymakers. The research
assessed current and [potential BCI applications for the]{.underline}
[military]{.underline} to ensure that the technology responds to actual
needs, practical realities, and legal and ethical considerations.
Despite valid concerns, [BCI can]{.underline} likely [be useful
for]{.underline} future **[military operations]{.underline}**. [The
application of **BCI**]{.underline} would **[support]{.underline}**
ongoing **[DoD technological initiatives]{.underline}**, [including
human-machine collaboration]{.underline} for improved decisionmaking,
[assisted]{.underline}-human [operations]{.underline}, [and advanced
manned and unmanned combat teaming. BCI falls subject to
the]{.underline} **[capability-vulnerability paradox]{.underline}**,
[with counterweighted benefits and risks.]{.underline} [**Precautions**
will need to be taken to **mitigate vulnerabilities to DoD
operations**]{.underline} [and institutions and]{.underline} to [reduce
potential ethical and legal risks associated with DoD\'s development and
adoption of BCI technologies.]{.underline}

[As Brain Computer Interface becomes less invasive and more
sophisticated, applications]{.underline} have already started to
[expand]{.underline} [outside of the medical sphere and
into]{.underline} the realm of [consumer tech]{.underline}nology.
Potential [military applications]{.underline} also continue to
[advance]{.underline}, and in an environment where [research funding is
increasingly harder to obtain]{.underline}, **[the Department of Defense
can be an important source of support]{.underline}**. The fundamental
mission of the Department of Defense differs significantly from that of
the National Institutes of Health, however, and these differences should
prompt additional scrutiny from both basic and translational
researchers. In this paper, I propose an ethical framework to facilitate
discussion, beginning with the classification of a technology into one
of three domains: restorative, augmentative, or disruptive.
[Consideration should be]{.underline} [given]{.underline} as
[to]{.underline} whether the technology has [applications across
domains]{.underline}: for example, [restorative NpBCI for]{.underline}
patients with [PTSD]{.underline} [could]{.underline} also potentially
[augment warfighters' capabilities to modulate their response to
stress]{.underline}ful stimuli on the battlefield; this phase of
analysis should [consider how]{.underline} difficult it would be [to
repurpose the technology]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} thus [how
likely it would be]{.underline} that it would be [used outside of its
intended scope]{.underline}. Finally, the analysis should
[include]{.underline} the likely [risks to patient physical
**health**]{.underline}, **[emotional well-being, and bodily
autonomy]{.underline}**. [These considerations will be]{.underline}
predominantly [related to the invasiveness of the
tec]{.underline}hnology, [but]{.underline} as discussed previously, will
[also]{.underline} be concerned with [alterations in]{.underline} normal
[emotional, or cognitive function]{.underline}. [Within]{.underline} the
domain of [disruptive BCI]{.underline}, [where some **disruption of
autonomy is a given**]{.underline}, [a significant conversation will
need to be held regarding]{.underline} [what]{.underline} kinds of
[interventions would]{.underline} or would not [be acceptable, under
what circumstances, and what]{.underline} [mechanisms]{.underline}
[might]{.underline} be available for [monitor]{.underline}ing
[appropriate use.]{.underline}

[The framework]{.underline} proposed [here is]{.underline} obviously not
exhaustive, but is [intended to provoke discussion]{.underline} in a way
that could [help]{.underline} [ensure that the pace of technological
advancement does not]{.underline} too far [outstrip our ethical
consensus, particular in]{.underline} the domain of [National Security,
where ethical considerations can differ substantially from]{.underline}
those of [civilian medical research]{.underline}. [Such]{.underline}
[discussion could]{.underline} help [ensure]{.underline} that [medical
researchers and physicians maintain a seat at the table]{.underline}
regarding application of the technology that they help develop, and
could also spark new ideas for innovations.

### 2AC -- DOD Key -- China

#### An improvement in DoD awareness of current biotechnology is crucial in sustaining advantageous U.S. defense, [especially]{.underline} b/c of China.

Republic of China

U.S. forces, and indeed the nation, have access to the safest, most
technologically advanced, most effective vaccines ever created. It is a
remarkable feat that DOD's mission can continue in the midst of a global
pandemic---made possible because the democratic government and
biotechnology industry of the United States prevailed. [U.S. and PRC
bioeconomies are indeed in a competition of systems, and U.S. strength
is in its values. However, to secure the role of biotechnology in DOD,
the rate of growth of the U.S. bioeconomy must increase more quickly
than that of China]{.underline}, and the United States will need to
protect its investments. We recommend the following plan of action. 1.
[Improve the situational awareness of the U.S. government---and **in
particular of DOD**]{.underline}--- [around the role of biotechnology in
the economy]{.underline}, supply chains, and domestic and foreign
manufacturing[. The responsibility to understand, prepare for, and
respond to threats to biotechnology is balkanized,]{.underline} [spread
across at least nine Departments]{.underline} and Agencies within the
Executive Branch, [demonstrating the broad scope of the problem.37
Specific **vulnerabilities in the bioeconomy affect biotechnology
security**, and these vulnerabilities will affect DOD in readiness,
health, and the ability to fulfill missions]{.underline}. Addressing
those [vulnerabilities must begin with a sustained, comprehensive effort
to understand the role of biotechnology in industry today]{.underline},
how that industry contributes to DOD supply chains, and [how DOD
acquisitions influence economic development and employment around the
United States.]{.underline} To that end, DOD should work with the
Department of Commerce to create domestic reporting codes for
biotechnology revenues and employment for the quarterly and annual
economic census and then push to include those codes in the North
American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) as soon as possible.38
Institutionalizing the gathering of these data via the NAICS, which is
how the rest of the economy is quantified, is the first step towards
sustainable policymaking and rational spending. The Department of
Commerce should consider adding import/export controls on biotechnology,
while avoiding overly broad restrictions that suffocate innovation.
[Solidifying the place of biotechnology as a foundational technology
protected by the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act
(FIRRMA) and Export Control Reform Act (ECRA) will be critical for
securing biotechnology.]{.underline}39 However, [biotechnology
competition is not exclusive to commercial activities**. It is a crucial
feature in sustaining an advantage in U.S. defense.** DOD should audit
critical defense innovation base vulnerabilities]{.underline} by
dependencies to assist the other agencies in bringing China's foreign
biotech access in line with standards in other major markets. The
drumbeat is accelerating, [calling DOD to document and secure supply
chains critical to defense applications and to the overall U.S.
economy.]{.underline} 40,41 [Securing DOD supply chains]{.underline},
which includes a recognition of their inputs from biotechnology and the
origins of the materials feeding those supply chains, [will buttress the
strength of the U.S. military in its mission sets and keep readiness
levels high]{.underline}. Current DOD efforts to expand domestic
biological manufacturing capabilities are a needed start42, but these
focused programs also serve to emphasize the larger strategic need to
understand and invest in the broader bioeconomy. [Enhance the
relationship between DOD and the National Economic Council to promote
DOD's]{.underline} economic and commercial interests and **[security
considerations]{.underline}**, which might be accomplished via an
empowered deputy national security adviser.

### 2AC -- DOD Key -- Ethics

One of the [long-term goals of biotech]{.underline}nology is the
[ability to **manipulate**]{.underline} the [human genome]{.underline}.
This science promises unlimited capabilities that extend beyond the
realm of medicine. Whether aimed to protect an individual from exposure
[to]{.underline} infectious disease or **[enhance the
soldier]{.underline}** by increasing mental acuity and physical
abilities, [human enhancements will increase the capabilities of
the]{.underline} American [soldier]{.underline}. While these
modifications will potentially benefit the armed forces, the
[institution will face moral, legal, and **political**
implications]{.underline} associated with research that intends to
modify human beings. [Human enhancement is a contentious
subject.]{.underline} Within it lies an assortment of opinions on the
capabilities it can provide and positions for or against its continued
research. Irrespective of the ongoing debate, the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and other research organizations grow
closer to ground breaking [innovations]{.underline} that [could have a
**major impact** on the institutional practices of the
**DoD**]{.underline}. [Therefore]{.underline}, novel concerns in
[**ethics and policy require** considerable **attention to fill the
gap** between the development of appropriate regulation and ongoing
scientific advancement.]{.underline} Furthermore, [**military mission
and requirements must bear weight** in the discussion of ethics and
policy]{.underline}. This will both [prevent the development of
restrictions that may **stifle** the procurement of valuable enhancement
capabilities and **ensure** that **military applications are subjected
to rigorous oversight.**]{.underline}

### 2AC -- DOD Key -- Genetics

This chapter analyzed the concept of enhancement, the military's
operational need for it, and how breakthroughs in genetic engineering
could soon create more biologically fit soldiers. Despite the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan drawing to a close, it is only a matter of time
before conflict abroad calls for America's attention. As history shows,
[the conduct of war **evolves** over time and with radical advancements
in tech]{.underline}nology, [the battlefield will become more lethal and
complex]{.underline}. [Modern advancements in
biotech]{.underline}nology, though radical, [may someday help the
military fill capability gaps by creating a force more physiologically
and intellectually fit to survive the rigors of future
conflict]{.underline}. Technological capability for such an endeavor is
years from existing. Nevertheless, [further research to assess the risks
and benefits associated with genetically modifying soldiers should
undoubtedly continue. **It is up to DoD** to decide the pros and cons of
genetic engineering and **establish policy** to determine which methods
should be used or prohibited]{.underline}. In the meantime, increasing
awareness and quelling public concerns surrounding genetic modification
is essential to prevent the disruption of further research and future
military application of genetic enhancements. The next chapter will
conclude this thesis and provide recommendation for future research.

### 2AC -- NATO Key

#### U.S.-NATO cooperation is key manage the rise of biotechnology

**AUSA '21** \[Association of the United States Army; private,
non-profit organization that serves as the professional association of
the United States Army; 7-15-2021; \"Cooperation, Readiness Critical to
US, NATO Alliance\"; AUSA;
https://www.ausa.org/news/cooperation-readiness-critical-us-nato-alliance;
Accessed 6-26-2022; RL\]

[The U.S. and NATO must continue to strengthen its partnership as the
world enters a "period of potential instability]{.underline}," America's
top uniformed leader said.

"In my view, [the world is entering a period of potential
instability]{.underline} as some [nations \... and]{.underline} clearly
[terrorist groups and]{.underline} perhaps some [rogue actors are
seeking to undermine and challenge the existing international
order]{.underline}," Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley said. "And
[they seek to **weaken** the system of **cooperation** and **collective
security** that has been in **existence** for some time]{.underline}."

Speaking July 15 in a ceremony aboard the USS Kearsarge to celebrate
NATO's newest operational headquarters, Joint Force Command Norfolk in
Virginia, Milley emphasized NATO's role in maintaining security and
called it "the most successful military alliance in human history."

"[NATO is still very much a **vital** and **critical part** of our
regional security framework and indeed our **global security
framework**]{.underline}," Milley. "In fact, in my view, [it\'s the
linchpin that holds together the period of great power peace that we are
now enjoying."]{.underline}

Milley also stressed the importance of maintaining readiness and
modernizing for the future, calling them keys to ensuring the U.S. can
meet future defense challenges.

"We have to maintain the readiness of the present, we have to modernize
for the future," Milley said. "We are ready right now. Those who think
we are not are mistaken, and any adversary that seeks to challenge the
United States military resolve will do well to respect this military and
our alliance and NATO."

In particular, Milley stressed that [the incorporation of new technology
will play a vital role in the military's readiness capabilities over the
next decade]{.underline} and said that technology, like precision
munitions, artificial intelligence and [**biotechnology**, will "have a
**fundamental impact** on the conduct of war]{.underline}."

Should the U.S. military not lean into technological advances, Milley
gave a grim warning.

"There\'s a whole set of technologies that are driving fundamental
change, and if we, the United States military, and we, [NATO as an
alliance]{.underline}, do not [adapt and adopt these
technologies]{.underline}, if we don\'t ... put the pedal to the metal
and do this right over the next 10 or 15 years, [we are condemning a
future generation to what happened 76 years ago."]{.underline}

Moving forward, Milley emphasized that continued cooperation will be a
key part of maintaining U.S. readiness, adding, "We as an alliance are
stronger together than we are individually."

"[We\'re going to succeed or fail as a **nation** with our **allies**
and **partners**, because the United States does not fight wars
alone]{.underline}," Milley said.

#### NATO is key because it considers the ethical concerns behind cognitive biotech, and the US military is key to ensure it

Alonso **Bernal et al**, 2-26-20**21**, \"NATO Review,\" NATO Review,

Advances in biophysical, biochemical and behavioural technologies are
beginning to turn science fiction into reality. These developments offer
exciting possibilities, while also raising issues with regard to ethics
and responsible use. [The Alliance faces a range of significant
opportunities in emerging and disruptive technologies. The field of
Cognitive Biotechnology (CBT) is an emerging domain with wide ranging
implications for Alliance members' economic and military
competitiveness.]{.underline} And, as was discussed in the case of
Artificial Intelligence, [developments in this field will require both a
dynamic adoption of new technologies and a focus on their responsible
governance.]{.underline} CBT is the ability for technology to enhance
and improve human thinking, sensing, coordinating, and acting upon the
physical and societal environment. [With CBT, our
effectiveness---normally constrained by the limits of human physiology
-- can now be extended and augmented by biophysical, biochemical, or
bioengineered means.]{.underline} The field is in its infancy, but [its
implications are vast.]{.underline} For instance, [in the last decade
scientists have accurately melded brain signals with machine interfaces
to create mind-controlled prosthetics. More recently they have made this
flow of information bi-directional, creating prosthetics that can now
feel sensation and send these feelings back to the brain. If humans can
actuate (i.e. put into motion or action) machines, and these machines
can in turn actuate humans, then we have moved beyond the confines of
our own physiology.]{.underline} Moreover, if these machines are mobile
and can interact with our minds at a distance, then [we have extended
our reach beyond our own physical limits. Conversely, our inner minds
are no longer off limits either: while emerging brain-computer
interfaces allow us to train and direct computers, computers are
increasingly able to peer into our minds and to train and enhance
us.]{.underline} Or, to put it another way, while we have been working
to improve and enhance our machines, we now realise that our machines
can enhance, improve -- and possibly control -- us. When considering the
wide-ranging uses of CBT, it helps to distinguish among three broad
application areas, which can be called "the 3 R's" -- Recover, Raise,
and Replace. [Recover includes the repair or rehabilitation of cognitive
and biological impairments that prevent the mind and body from
functioning effectively. The goal is to return abilities back to
baseline functionality. Applications include helping injured soldiers
recover their physical capabilities; healing traumatic brain injury;
treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); recovering or (in cases
of traumatic stress) suppressing memories; and restoring decision-making
and executive functions.]{.underline} Raise includes the augmentation
and enhancement of cognitive and physiological function past an
individual's natural baseline, thereby effecting dramatic changes in
operational effectiveness, preparedness, and training. [Applications
include sensory enhancement (such as seeing farther or hearing more
acutely); faster information processing; quicker and more effective
decision-making; more efficient learning and language acquisition; and
greater physical exertion and endurance.]{.underline} What is true for
individual capabilities could similarly be true for groups. CBT could be
used to raise unit capabilities through distributed intelligence -- that
is, all members of the unit see and know what each individual member
sees and knows, thus reducing the "fog of war" and improving rapid
decision-making, as well as enabling more rapid acquisition and
assimilation of new fighting techniques and technologies. Replace
includes the enhancement (and possibly substitution) of mental and
physical functions past the bounds of human potential. Sensory
connections could be replaced with computer interfaces, making human
capabilities independent of their five natural senses. Verbal
communication could be replaced by computer-aided telepathy or data
downloads. Physical action could be replaced by remote robots or "loyal
wingman" drones directed by the mind of the operator. This is perhaps
the most futuristic form of enhancement, with most research and
development nascent in nature. It is important to note that this form of
enhancement does not completely remove human interaction, or else it
would be simply another form of automation; it is really about the
merger of human biology and mechanical actuation. These distinctions may
prove helpful in setting priorities for further research, investment in
technological development, and adoption for operational use. And they
could also help in setting principles of responsible use, considering
the three categories' differing levels of technical risk and ethical
uncertainty. [Cognitive Biotechnologies are at present focused on three
main areas of research: biophysical, biochemical and behavioural. The
future direction of these technologies is difficult to predict,
particularly as many are still emerging. But they have the potential to
significantly disrupt existing assumptions about the evolution of civil
society, the economy, and military affairs. It is therefore in the
interest of the Alliance to closely monitor the rise of those
technologies and applications that are most likely to affect or disrupt
current defence constructs and doctrine.]{.underline} [Moreover, it will
be important to direct early-stage investment into those areas that are
particularly promising for the Alliance, or to those which will most
likely impact its competitiveness.]{.underline} Advances in the
biophysical area centre on brain computer interfaces (BCI), which can be
directly inserted into the human body or via transcranial direct-current
stimulation (tDCS). tDCS is a form of neuromodulation that uses
constant, direct currents delivered via electrodes on the head, and can
be worn or removed at will. While BCI was originally developed to
provide assistive technologies (such as prosthetic arms and mentally
controlled wheelchairs), recent developments in bi-directionality have
allowed for enhanced sensing, for example, bionic eyes or other
enhancements to situational awareness. Further applications of these
technologies could lead to mental control of aircraft or ground vehicle
systems; mind-guided drones or missiles; or the mechanisation of
soldiers via exoskeletons and advanced sensors. At the same time, tDCS
applications have been shown to regulate the human brain itself,
affecting the brain's executive functions, learning mechanisms, memory,
language processing, sensory perception, and motor functions. [Current
work with tDCS focuses on recovery from PTSD and treatment of mental
ailments like obsessive compulsive disorder. But the technology also
provides for the possibility of raising soldiers' cognitive and physical
capabilities: to analyse scenarios more easily and quickly; to retain
and retrieve memories with greater acuity; to modulate perceptions of
pain; to improve psychological self-protection; and to embed muscle
memory and motor skills more quickly.]{.underline} Another controversial
aspect of tDCS is the potential to look inside the mind of the user, to
display and play back past memories on an external monitor, or even to
insert synthetic memories and images into the mind. Biochemical research
has focused on enhancements to human physiology and cognitive function
via drugs, genetic modification and biological derivatives. Combinations
of nootropic compounds, both natural and synthetic, have been shown to
rebalance and optimise neurochemistry for improved brain and nervous
system function and efficiency. [These have the potential for raising
alertness and attention; speeding up reaction times; enhancing endurance
and mental resilience; reducing apprehension and fear; and improving
group dynamics and coordination. Recovery aspects include the treatment
of depression, PTSD, memory loss, and dementia. Behavioural research is
focused on the modification and improvement of cognitive and motor
function through learning algorithms, virtual reality and biofeedback
methods.]{.underline} Virtual reality environments have already
demonstrated their use in the training of pilots, tank crews and
infantry. Mental acuity can be enhanced by training and gamification
algorithms. Behaviour and personal habits can be altered by
reinforcement learning methods. Applications focus on both improvement
and recovery, with recent advances in the treatment of PTSD and
behavioural disorders. The integration of real-time cognitive and
physiological user data (e.g., measures of attention, heart rate, etc.)
opens a new vista for raising physical and cognitive performance.
Motivational stimuli can be delivered back to the user based on his
current physiological and mental state via machine learning-derived
algorithms. The future of a personal coach on an intelligent FitBit that
motivates and guides you to peak performance may not be too far away.
The aggregation of anonymised data from individual performance outcomes
into big datasets could further improve these algorithms. The result may
be a FitBit that knows you better than you know yourself. There are
several ethical considerations for CBT that may transcend even AI in
their complexity. First is the issue of personal agency. If CBT is able
to motivate, enable, and even control human decision making and action,
where does individual responsibility end? Are soldiers responsible for
their actions when under the influence of advanced CBT, and under what
conditions? [Relatedly, how does the Alliance ensure that there is
sufficient consent for the use of CBT for individuals tasked to use the
technology?]{.underline} These technologies can be invasive, both
physiologically and mentally, and have the potential to cause harm,
particularly as we do not fully understand their unintended cognitive
and biological consequences. In addition, significant privacy concerns
will be raised once these technologies can enter our minds and see our
most private thoughts and memories. What are the limits of such
searches? And what are the protections for physiological and cognitive
data, and who may store and control their dissemination or cause their
deletion? More generally, what protections will we have against the
potential of mind control, cognitive erasure, and reprogramming? [The
Alliance's success with CBT will depend upon well-designed principles
and practices relating to these ethical considerations, since the
adoption and integration of these technologies will be based on the
consent and acceptance of Allied governments and their societies at
large. As in the case of AI, the Alliance and member governments will
need to develop principles of responsible use, addressing such issues as
privacy, consent, lawfulness, responsibility and
governability.]{.underline}

Communication of those new discoveries is occurring faster than ever,
meaning that [the unique ownership of a piece of new technology is no
longer a sufficient position]{.underline}, if not impossible. The
information revolution and globalization themselves have been major
drivers. It is widely regarded that [recognition of the potential
applications of a technology and a sense of purpose in exploiting it are
far more important than simply having access to it today]{.underline}.
Technological surprise has and will continue to take many forms. A
plethora of [new technologies are under development for peaceful means
but may have unintended security consequences and will certainly require
innovative countermeasures]{.underline}. For example, [tremendous
developments in biotechnology have occurred since the advent of
recombinant DNA and tissue culture-based processes in the 1970s. If the
potential for biotechnology to affect fundamental security and
warfighting doctrines had been more clearly recognized twenty years ago,
the]{.underline} **[situation today could be very
different]{.underline}**. **[Defense against biological weapons---from
both states and non-state actors---currently presents a threat that is
difficult to predict and for which traditional solutions are
increasingly less effective and offers an area for strategic foresight
to be valuable.]{.underline}**

The dual use conundrum applies to all modern technologies. Because of
the other characteristics of the changing strategic environment, it is
of greater concern. [Historically, dual use previously referred to
technologies that could be meaningfully used by both the civilian and
military sectors. In light of an ever-changing security environment in
which the potential for technologies to be misused by both state and
non-state actors has become increasingly prevalent, however, a new
conceptualization of dual use, in which the same technologies can be
used legitimately for human betterment and misused for nefarious
purposes, such as terrorism, has emerged]{.underline}. The National
Institutes of Health's Office of Science Policy has promulgated a
similar understanding of dual use [in]{.underline} its [discussions and
policies on biosecurity]{.underline}. In keeping with these
understandings, this work adopts a similar definition of dual use as
[research "conducted for legitimate purposes]{.underline} that generates
knowledge, information, technologies, and/or products that [could be
utilized for both benevolent and harmful purposes]{.underline},"8 i.e.,
[research that can have beneficial impacts as well as unintended
deleterious consequences.]{.underline}

Within international security, there is a rich literature exploring the
intersection of science, technology, and understanding the outcomes of
armed conflict.9 Similarly, for scholars of science and technology
studies, the intersection of new technology and weapons application has
a rich literature.10 For strategists and scholars of revolution in
military affairs (RMA)11 and of fourth and fifth generation warfare (4GW
& 5GW),12 [the nexus between technology and military affairs
is]{.underline} not just speculation [but a reality that bears directly
on the propensity for conflict and outcomes of war, as well as the
**efficacy of security cooperation and coercive statecraft**. It is a
**critical variable in international security**: military outcomes and
technological advances are intricately tied.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- US Key

#### Federal funding [ensures]{.underline} ethical groundwork for future generations--US [key]{.underline} to prevent eugenics

**Dohn 18** (Dohn, Michael R. 2018. \"Preventing an Era of New Eugenics:
an Argument for Federal Funding and Regulation of Gene Editing Research
in Human Embryos.\" Richmond Journal of Law & Technology, vol. 25, no.
2, 2018, pp. 23-26. HeinOnline.)

\[30\] Regardless of which side of the germline-gene-editing-fence one
falls, genomic editing of human embryos is currently happening in
several parts of the world. 128 Importantly, [an outright ban in the
U.S. on gene editing research in human embryos **would not only fail to
curtail research in other countries, but it may also drive scientists to
other parts of the world** to perform such research.]{.underline} 129
Moreover, existing research involving human embryos has shown that gene
editing technology is nowhere near perfected. 130 As one scholar has
noted, [\"\[c\]urrent genome editing technology does not have sufficient
efficiency and specificity to be reliably safe \... and \[off-target\]
effects will not always be benign or predictable.. ,]{.underline} \"131
Thus, more research is needed to ensure that if and when this technology
becomes commonplace, it is safe and reliable. Rather than promulgate
laws to directly regulate the use and application of gene editing
techniques themselves, the U.S. government has chosen to address the
issue of gene editing research in human embryos at the level of the
purse. [If gene editing research was endorsed and adequately funded in
the U.S., however, **it could be tightly controlled to ensure that it is
used for appropriate purposes**, thereby satisfying proponents of such
research while also addressing relevant ethical concerns.]{.underline}
IV. FUNDING & REGULATING GENE EDITING IN HUMAN EMBRYOS \[31\] Congress
should enact legislation allowing for federal funding of gene editing
research in human embryos. Such legislation should be enacted in concert
with additional regulations to ensure that public monies are used
appropriately. [Funding gene editing research would promote, rather than
stifle, innovation, and by providing a proper regulatory framework,
Congress can ensure that **the safety and ethical concerns** associated
with this technology are adequately addressed.]{.underline} A.
Permitting Federal Funding for Gene Editing Research in Human Embryos
\[32\] A major concern for opponents to gene editing research in human
embryos is that the absence of oversight could lead to the misuse of the
technology and the creation of designer babies. [However, allowing
federal funding for gene editing research in human embryos **will drive
both regulatory and ethical oversight of this field of research**.
Issuance of federal grants by the NIH requires that recipients \"comply
with all applicable Federal statutes . . . regulations, and
policies.]{.underline} 13 Current compliance regulations are extensive
and include a wide-range of oversight activities, such as reporting
requirements, public welfare protections, and compliance site visits.I33
[Additionally, permitting federal funding for this area of research will
ensure that the research remains in the public domain, thus allowing for
transparency and public oversight through peer-review of research and
sharing of data and research resources.]{.underline} 34 In the absence
of public funding for gene editing research, however, \"there is a risk
that research will move offshore and/or to areas where it is subject to
fewer regulations and less oversight and where work is done without
transparency.\" \'35 \[33\] [The lack of federal funding for genome
editing research in human embryos is also **putting the U.S. behind
other countries** in the quest for knowledge, discovery, and
technology.]{.underline} While gene editing in human embryos is not
banned in the U.S., the lack of available public funds severely hampers
domestic advancement of gene editing technologies.\'36 Jennifer Doudna,
a leader of the research team holding multiple U.S. patents for
CRISPR-Cas9 technology, 3 7 argues that [**federal funding of basic
research \"lays the groundwork for future innovation\"** and \"is
critical to encourage our scientists to pursue not just the challenges
that are relatively easy, or obviously profitable, but the ones that are
fiendishly hard-yet crucial.\" \'138]{.underline}

#### Lack of federal funding [prohibits]{.underline} the US from being able to remain a leader in the field--[must]{.underline} increase funding to prevent research outsourcing

**Dohn 18** (Dohn, Michael R. 2018. \"Preventing an Era of New Eugenics:
an Argument for Federal Funding and Regulation of Gene Editing Research
in Human Embryos.\" Richmond Journal of Law & Technology, vol. 25, no.
2, 2018, pp. 26-28. HeinOnline.)

In addition to promoting innovation, federal funding for gene editing
technologies has economic benefits. [While some U.S. biotech firms may
benefit from the export of the technology to other jurisdictions, the
development and improvement of the technology for use in humans is
occurring primarily in other countries.]{.underline}139 Thus, the U.S.
is deprived of any economic benefits deriving from the development of
such technologies on its own soil and is losing an edge in its ability
to recruit the best scientists and researchers in this burgeoning field.
140 \[34\] To be sure, CRISPR-Cas9 research in human embryos is
currently being conducted in the U.S.; 141 however, such research is
funded only by private organizations. 142 [This highlights the notion
that **restrictive federal funding policies \"do not necessarily prevent
certain research** or the development of new technologies from taking
place.\"]{.underline} 143 However, the amount of private funding for
biomedical research is dwarfed by public funding levels: it was
estimated that in 2015, federal funding for basic research in life
sciences was nearly forty times greater than available private funding
in that sector. 144 [By removing restrictions on funding for gene
editing research in human embryos, **it is more than likely that funding
levels for research in this field will increase several-fold**, thereby
promoting the rapid development of this technology within U.S.
borders.]{.underline} \[35\] There are also international security
concerns associated with a failure to fund gene editing research. By not
fostering the industry\'s development in the U.S., the technology is
driven overseas where it may one day be used to develop military
applications. 145 Countries that fund and permit development of the
technology in human embryos may be able to \"create \'super soldiers\'
to dominate future battlefields.\" \'46 Gene editing technology is more
likely to be used to develop biological weapons focused on ecological
and agricultural issues,147 and the threat of \"super soldiers,\" if
ever realized, is likely a long way off. However, it remains a concern
that needs to be taken seriously and closely monitored, 148 even if it
borders on science-fiction. \[36\] [By recognizing that **withholding
federal funding will not prevent gene editing research in human embryos

Congress has an opportunity to retain control of this technology\'s
development and ensure that the **U.S. remains a leader** in this
field.]{.underline} Public funding of gene editing research in human
embryos will provide economic, military, and social benefits, and by
controlling the purse, Congress can maintain tight regulatory control

Regulations \[37\] Currently in the United States, the regulatory
framework regarding gene modification in humans is sparse. The only
federal law that references heritable genetic modification is the
Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, which merely restricts federal
funding for gene modification research in human embryos. 149 [If public
funding was made available for gene editing research involving human

#### Industry botches cognitive biotech -- profit incentives reinforce privilege and exclusivity

Elon Musk is designing an electronic brain implant. The implant could
help people with disabilities, improve our cognitive abilities and even
lead to a form of digital immortality. But the technology is not without
its dangers. [The ability for a select few to enhance themselves and not
others, could pose an **existential threat** to our
societies]{.underline}, writes Éric Fourneret.

\"Neuralink\" is a start-up created by Elon Musk in 2016. The company's
main aim is brain implants development by means of electronic chips that
are inserted into the brain and equipped with a form of artificial
intelligence. This kind of technology focuses on helping persons with
disabilities, for example, to communicate or to move. At first glance,
\"Neuralink\" does not seem to present any particular ethical
difficulties. Helping persons with disabilities respects the principle
of beneficence, in other words, it acts or has qualities of mercy,
kindness, generosity, charity, altruism, love, humanity, and promoting
the good of others. But Elon Musk clarified his goal: \"Over time I
think we will probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence
and digital intelligence\" (World Government Summit in Dubai). And he
continued: \"Some high bandwidth interface to the brain will be
something that helps achieve a symbiosis between human and machine
intelligence." In 2020, Musk indicated that \"you could upload, you
could basically store your memories as a backup and restore the
memories, then ultimately you could potentially download them into a new
body or into a robot body\".

For a long time, Elon Musk was afraid of the prospect of deep artificial
intelligence, also called the \"Singularity\" -- that is, the creation
of an intelligent machine with a form of autonomy and a better
organizational potential than human abilities. For him, this would be a
dangerous situation which is why he supports research to merge human
intelligence and artificial intelligence, and thus to avoid that the
latter exceed the former. The brain implant development is
conceptualized in this context, but we can notice a logical
contradiction in Musk's reasoning, e.g., developing AI to limit its
advancement.

It is maybe excessive to consider Musk\'s thinking in terms of a
philosophical system. [It is]{.underline} rather [a futurist vision of
human beings]{.underline}, extrapolated from observable trends today,
especially in space exploration, self-driving cars and the current
development of AI. But, while Musk\'s thinking is not a philosophical
system, it is nonetheless inspired by different philosophical theories.
We can explore at least two of them.

The [first]{.underline} dimension is [anthropological]{.underline}: it
is [the idea of **human perfectibility**]{.underline}. We especially
know it through Rousseau's philosophy, but a version of it can be found
in William Godwin's writing: "By perfectible, it is not meant that he
\[the human being\] is capable of being brought to perfection. But the
word seems sufficiently adapted to express the faculty of being
continually made better and receiving perpetual improvement; and in this
sense, it is here to be understood. The term perfectible, this
explained, not only does not imply the capacity of being brought the
perfection, but stands in express opposition to it." Thus, there is no
apparent limit to perfectibility. This manner of understanding human
perfectibility is typical to Musk's vision of the human being.

This is an interesting aspect because a lot of people accept this sense
of the notion and consider that is one of humanity's defining features.
On the one hand, it is an optimistic notion because it is full of
promises for humanity's future. As if we will always find solutions to
overcome vulnerabilities that cause suffering and misfortunes, even if
it generally refers to an indeterminate future.

But on the other hand, we know that [progress can]{.underline}
eventually [become a new source of vulnerability]{.underline}. For
instance, [cars]{.underline} (1885, Tricycle Benz 1), [and planes
(]{.underline}1903, Wright brothers flight) [represented a significant
progress before they became a serious problem]{.underline} for living
beings. [Today]{.underline} [they are **polluting** the
earth]{.underline} [and are a]{.underline} [major threat to
**biodiversity**]{.underline}. For this reason, [the notion of human
perfectibility can be a]{.underline} source of [concern when it is used
to justify]{.underline} the achievement of [anything technologically
possible.]{.underline} It is in this context that \"bio-conservatives\"
denounce the \"Neuralink\" project as a moral transgression because
[different **essential limits would be erased**]{.underline}, limits
[which]{.underline} [constitute what it means to be human]{.underline}.
According to \"bio-conservatives\", the \"[Neuralink]{.underline}\"\'
brain implant suppr[esses the frontier between natural/artificial,
human/machine, living/no-living.]{.underline} Thus, [the merger of human
intelligence and artificial intelligence]{.underline} sought by Musk
[would]{.underline} [be as]{.underline} much [an **artificialization of
the human**]{.underline} as a humanization of the machine.

If this type of hybridization could seriously help a person with a
disability, we could have a positive moral judgment about it. [If it
is]{.underline} rather a question of access to [a type of immortality by
suppressing the biological body]{.underline} in favor of a robotic body,
we could still contend that such a pursuit depends on each person's
desires, so long as there is no damage for others (minimalist ethics).
But in this case [how can a]{.underline} [competition for more
human]{.underline} performances (human being [enhancement]{.underline})
[be avoided]{.underline}? [With the high cost]{.underline} of these
neurotechnologies, one can fear that [**only** a small part of **the
richest population will have access** to them.]{.underline} There would
be an even bigger physical and social disparity than the one we know
currently, and potentially, [a hierarchy of value attributed to
individuals]{.underline}. In this case, it is not clear that we would
look positively upon the Neuralink project, and it is not only a
question of its purpose since it would probably not result in a
co-evolution between human biology and technology, but in a domination
of the latter over the former.

These last ethical elements are important because they highlight a
second philosophical dimension of Musk\'s vision: liberalism.

Neuralink and [the]{.underline} Musk\'s [futurist vision of the human
being supposes]{.underline} a philosophical theory that we name
\"liberalism\", owed to John Locke in its modern form. We can retain at
least two crucial ideas. The first is economic freedom. [Everyone has
the right to have a property]{.underline} [and]{.underline} to [use
it]{.underline} as they see fit [so long as they do not use it to cause
damage to others.]{.underline} As a startup, [Neuralink is Musk\'s
property]{.underline}. The second idea is [intellectual
freedom]{.underline}, such as freedom of expression, the right to
develop one's ideas, beliefs and values. In other words, the
individual's responsibility is anchored in individual rights. All these
aspects [can be found in Neuralink in two dimensions: **technological
liberalism and moral liberalism.**]{.underline}

[Neuralink]{.underline} is a startup and as such, it [seeks to
achieve]{.underline} certain [economic objectives]{.underline} to exist.
We know AI development is an important growth area and it is
understandable that Neuralink also adheres to this mantra of the liberal
economy in its project to develop \"intelligent\" brain implants. More
specifically, we can speak of [technological liberalism]{.underline} to
deno[te economic goals closely related to technological
progress.]{.underline} Nonetheless, this correlation implies significant
promises, to not say utopias. Indeed, [Musk promises]{.underline} a form
of [immortality]{.underline}, [but delivering]{.underline} on such a
promise [seem far off]{.underline}. This begs the following question:
[if the idea of immortality were not so lucrative, would Musk still want
to develop a brain computer interface to upload our mind into a robotic
body]{.underline}? But maybe it is reasonable to question whether the
enhancement project is not more of a marketing strategy, possibly to
support the medical aspect.

With Neuralink project, [Musk does not claim to]{.underline} want to
[impose]{.underline} on anyone [an \"intelligent\" device brain
implant]{.underline}; neither, if it were even possible, to become
immortal. Everyone makes their own decisions and if some individuals
wish to receive a brain implant, then no one should discourage or stop
them because this would imply constraining individual beliefs and
values.

In other words, [everyone remains free to do what they want and as long
as no one causes intentional damage to another]{.underline}. No one has
to dictate to others a particular conception of the Good. In this moral
context, [Neuralink is in keeping with liberalism]{.underline} in that
[nobody can claim to know what is best]{.underline} for someone else and
in that everyone has sovereign control over their own body.

To conclude, even if we were to adhere to the idea that freedom is about
every individual's right to choose, we must [consider]{.underline}, for
example, [the **limited accessibility** to
neurotechnologies]{.underline} due to their cost. Namely, [this
could]{.underline} have the effect of [favor]{.underline}ing **[already
privileged]{.underline}** social [categories]{.underline} for certain
professions (i.e. medicine, sciences, philosophy\...), or even for major
political professions, such as the professions of higher administration.
It would raise serious questions for democracies.

At the same time, [we cannot deprive ourselves of the]{.underline}
potential [benefits of \"intelligent\" brain implants]{.underline} and
their applications to help medical diagnostic and therapeutic gaps in
various brain disorders, and also to improve social relations and
preserve natural conditions of living beings. For this reason, [brain
sciences and neurotechnologies are an important field for social,
ethical and philosophical reflection]{.underline}. Even though Neuralink
is a private initiative, the \"[tomorrow]{.underline}\" that this
startup traces [requires]{.underline} a form of [moral
responsibility]{.underline} which need not be only understood as an
individual choice: a human community is not a sum of individuals,
otherwise (if one were to consider it as such) one runs the risk of
condemning the idea of humanity and humanist values). This is the reason
why Musk morally cannot avoid the philosophical question -- \"What is
Human?\"

#### Industry egregiously mishandles ethics

**Zeitchik 5/3** (Steven Zeitchik, Columbia University and Yeshiva
University; reporter for over 10 years; The Arthur F. Burns Prize for
Foreign Reporting. The Washington Post, \"Why Neuralink, not Twitter, is
Elon Musk's biggest
challenge\", 5/3/2022, https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/05/03/elon-musk-neuralink-twitter/, accessed

Elon Musk's successful bid of \$44 billion to buy Twitter defied Wall
Street pundits and social media wisdom. But it wasn't brain surgery.
That will be much more difficult. Viewed against the spotlight-basking
Tesla or SpaceX, Musk's private neurotech start-up Neuralink, which aims
to cut small holes in patients' skulls and insert brain implants in
them, often fades into the background. Yet it is the moonshot firm that
has prompted some of the entrepreneur's biggest boasts --- and might
yield some of his strongest head winds. Stronger, even, than a certain
social media firm. "I think he's ultimately going to have a much harder
time with Neuralink than he'll have with all his other companies,
including Twitter," said Anna Wexler, a close observer of Neuralink and
principal investigator of the University of Pennsylvania's Wexler Lab,
which focuses on emerging technology. "Medicine just has so many
obstacles you don't have in other areas, and it's not clear he
recognizes that." Neurotech is fraught enough that Meta bailed on its
long-running investment in a mind-reading device last year, before its
first implant. Even as he was cranking the volume on his Twitter
interest in April, [Musk was touting the epic-ness of his "brain-machine
interface]{.underline}," or BMI --- the tantalizing idea of a brain
sending instructions directly to a computer. Musk said at Ted2022 that
for much of the next decade, Neuralink will produce a medical
wonder-tool that can cure paralysis and also "solve a very wide range of
brain injuries including severe depression, morbid obesity, sleep,
potentially schizophrenia --- a lot of things that cause great stress to
people." Yet [scientists]{.underline} not only [eye-roll]{.underline}
such talk as standard Muskian hype but say that [it deliberately ignores
**highly specific challenges**]{.underline} not found in any of his
other businesses. Wexler and others note that [**ethical** and publicity
**pitfalls**]{.underline}, [the **slow pace** of trials]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} **[scientific uncertainty]{.underline}** and even a
14-year-old competitor named Blackrock Neurotech, all of which could
[e]{.underline}nsure that it's nearly a decade before any Neuralink
product is mass-distributed, let alone effectively cures the ills Musk
describes. They also look askance at the idea that a tech magnate who's
clashed with agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission is
going to fit comfortably in the regulation-heavy business of medical
treatments. But the story is instructive not only for what it says about
a freewheeling executive confronting a safeguard-heavy system but for
what happens when a niche corner of science has a light thrown on it by
a social media celebrity. All that wattage has created a divide within
the neuro community. Is Musk a strange bedfellow they can live with to
save people? Or a distraction whose hype will undermine critical
research? "The simple truth is, whether academics or entrepreneurs want
to accept this, a lot of people would not be talking about neurotech had
Elon not made this his focus," said Marcus Gerhardt, chief executive and
co-founder of the Utah-based Blackrock. But, he added, [the hype
was]{.underline} also [dangerous]{.underline}. "If you send a sporadic
message, on the spur of the moment, to patients and get their hopes up,
[it's irresponsible]{.underline} no matter how you try to turn it." Ed
Niedermeyer, the automotive analyst who wrote a book about Musk and
Tesla, said that [Neuralink]{.underline} is "a perfect example of what
Musk does --- [make claims that are so extravagant he hopes you won't
spend much time thinking about them."]{.underline} BMI tech works by
"recording" brain signals via electrodes implanted in the brain. That
recording then allows an algorithm to combine all the signals and
transmit them to a computer --- potentially allowing paralyzed people to
walk again via a robotic limb, or ALS patients who can't speak to type
instructions for a computer-generated voice. Why Elon Musk\'s Twitter
bid is so polarizing While meaningful signals are generated by 100-200
electrodes (Blackrock's amount, via the "Utah Array" approach),
Neuralink captures 1,024 electrodes per implant, via a breakthrough
"sewing" technique. Licensed from University of California at San
Francisco research, it involves the stitching together of many
electrodes in a polymer thread. (An implant is the diameter of a
quarter, but five times thicker.) Neuralink was founded in 2016 but
little publicized until a streaming event three years ago. Musk's
current boasts that he could make tetraplegics walk again are in fact a
reining in of his promises then; at that presentation, he went far
beyond medical uses to pledge that Neuralink's devices could "achieve a
sort of symbiosis with artificial intelligence" and "ultimately help
secure humanity's future as a civilization relative to AI." Musk has
talked less about AI-melding recently (scientists say it is, at best,
many decades away). But he has kept the hype machine churning.
"Short-term: solve brain/spine injuries. Long-term: human/AI symbiosis,"
he tweeted in January 2021. Last April, Neuralink released a viral video
that showed a monkey playing Pong with its mind. It set the Internet
ablaze with 6 million views and dozens of awed news articles. But
[publicity coups]{.underline} can [come with crisis]{.underline}. In
February, Neuralink acknowledged that at least [some of its]{.underline}
23 **[experiment monkeys died]{.underline}**, after the
[an]{.underline}imal rights-minded Physicians Committee for Responsible
Medicine sent a letter to USDA alleging "apparent [egregious violations
of the Animal Welfare Act."]{.underline} The group said the [monkeys
"had their brains mutilated in shoddy experiments and were left to
suffer and die]{.underline}." Neuralink has denied the charges, saying
it is "absolutely committed to working with animals in the most humane
and ethical way possible." The company has also faced staffing
challenges. [Neuralink's]{.underline} longtime [executive]{.underline}
Max Hodak [left]{.underline} last year amid reports he was
[uncomfortable with]{.underline} Musk's [accelerated
timelines]{.underline} for new products. [Six of the eight original
scientists]{.underline} --- many from UCSF, including a highly touted
researcher named Philip Sabes --- have also [left]{.underline} the firm.
Sabes and Hodak did not reply to requests seeking comment. Requests for
comment from both Neuralink and Musk were not returned. Elon Musk as
owner is a long-feared reality for Twitter employees [FDA]{.underline}
approval for implantable medical devices [is a deliberate
process]{.underline}, aimed at laying down every speed bump before
doctors are allowed to surgically implant machines. Musk's M.O., of
course, is to move fast and crack china. The mogul initially said he
would start human trials by the end of 2020, then postponed them to
2021. In January, he said he was hiring a director of those trials to
begin this year; no such director has yet been announced. Meanwhile,
neuroscientists question the company's prowess as a research center,
noting that the MindPong video was essentially executed by researchers
nearly 20 years ago. "They are a great engineering company, making
smaller, slicker products that are wireless and use Bluetooth and so
definitely a step forward," said one neuroscientist at a top university
who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize future
relationships with Musk. "But they are not a research company, and it is
testament to how good a publicist he is that much of the country doesn't
realize that." And while 1,024 electrodes implanted in the brain instead
of a couple hundred is an advance, neuroscientists say, it offers no
demonstrable edge in human-mobility applications; Blackrock's decade-old
tech can basically do the same thing. That company already has
FDA-approved devices implanted in 32 patients in trials around the
world. Blackrock also tends to articulate far more measured timelines.
"It feels like there are two companies basically doing the same thing.
One is doing it the right way and Elon Musk is doing it the wrong way,"
said Laura Cabrera, an associate professor of engineering science and
mechanics at Pennsylvania State University who follows neurotech
companies. She particularly questioned **[human trials]{.underline}**,
[asking how a company with **few**]{.underline} formal [**ties to
medical institutions** might convince people]{.underline} to let it
insert devices into their brains. "I really don't know where he'll find
subjects," Cabrera said. "[Maybe on Twitter]{.underline}?" Another
neuroscientist who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to
jeopardize relations with Musk worried that [bold promises]{.underline}
[left unmet]{.underline} could also, over time, [dampen public and
investor interest]{.underline}, and even choke off lifesaving research.
Musk has undeniably propelled a wave of capital so far. Neuralink has
raised at least \$363 million in venture investment, including \$100
million from Musk and an undisclosed sum from Google Ventures. Shortly
after the MindPong video, Blackrock announced a \$10 million venture
round, its first, including an infusion from the venture-capital
provocateur Peter Thiel. Two months later, Musk, Thiel's PayPal
co-founder, announced Thiel had also invested in Neuralink. This marks a
sea change. After the collapse of a groundbreaking company called
Cyberkinetics in the late 2000s (Blackrock acquired and is founded on
its research), funding for neurotech essentially dried up until Musk
came along. "Companies, Neuralink and otherwise, that are playing in
this space make me feel very grateful," said Paul Nuyujukian, director
of Stanford University's Brain Interfacing Laboratory and one of the
field's founding pioneers. "Because it validates everything the academic
community has been doing for so many years and paints a picture of the
promise of this field for improving medical outcomes for people with
significant brain disease." He said he was troubled, but only slightly,
by the kind of far-off speculation offered by people like Musk. "Vision
is good. You need to have vision to be able to reach a goal. It's the
making of promises that I think is dangerous because you can mislead the
public.\" "We just need to make sure," he said, "that, when we're laying
out a vision of where we're going, we're also being honest about where
we are."

is]{.underline} a [growing]{.underline} field of interest [with medical
applications]{.underline} ranging [from **prevention, detection, and
diagnosis to rehabilitation and restoration.**]{.underline} A BCI is a
combination of hardware and software communications that allow humans to
control external devices such as computers through cerebral activity
alone. [Extensive BCI research is being done to]{.underline} develop
devices that [aid]{.underline} people with disabilities, particularly
those affected by **[neurological and neuromuscular conditions such as
spinal cord injury, brain strokes, and amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis.]{.underline}** Commonly Used BCI Technologies
Electroencephalography (EEG), which records electrical activity directly
from the brain through electrodes placed on the scalp, remains the top
neuroimaging method for BCI-based products because it is extremely
cost-effective and portable. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown promise in BCI research due
to their non-invasive characteristics and good temporal and spatial
resolution. MEG uses magnetometers to capture the magnetic fields
produced by the brain's electrical activity; fMRI uses MRI technology to
detect changes in the brain's blood flow. Some of the most promising BCI
application areas are explained below. **[Wheelchair
Assistance]{.underline}** Disabilities affecting locomotion degrade
quality of life and reduce life expectancy. Scientists have been
considering [invasive and non-invasive approaches to help people who use
wheelchairs.]{.underline} The non-invasive approach is preferred because
of its ease of use and limited or no discomfort. Paraplegics or those
with other locomotor disabilities can drive wheelchairs using
EEG-enabled BCI devices. Users can activate three levels of assistance
with a BCI-powered wheelchair: obstacle avoidance, collision avoidance
and orientation recovery. Laser scanners on the wheelchair enable a
degree of autonomy by detecting potential obstacles, allowing the device
to accordingly evaluate the situation. The main challenge with these
BCI-powered wheelchairs is the lack of accurate, real-time control
because of infrequent signals and low information transfer rate. As a
result, research continues in the development of invasive devices that
are driven by user decisions and overcome the commonly faced low bit
rate of non-invasive BCIs. Invasive BCI systems include electrodes that
are implanted in the brain. These solutions have yet to evolve
completely because current offerings can be painful and require
regulatory approval before use. Proof of efficacy requires extensive
clinical trials that are costly and time-consuming, which can discourage
some manufacturers. The University of Twente in the Netherlands is among
the academic institutions exploring the use of BCI systems in wheelchair
mobility. Similar research in prosthesis and environment control is
continuing at the University of California with the goal of helping
paraplegics regain basic brain-controlled motion. **[Motor Restoration

**[Touch]{.underline}** Researchers from the University of Chicago have
developed a BCI solution that could restore the sense of touch [for
paralyzed patients]{.underline}. The solution consists of a robotic arm
that is connected to the user's brain via BCI technology. This solution
is based on biomimetic mapping-based BCIs that aim to capture the
natural relationship between cortical activity [and]{.underline}
volitional arm or hand movement that is then used to control a
prosthetic arm or orthosis. The robotic arm provides a sensory feedback
based on the patterns recorded in the system transmitted from the
electrodes that are implanted in the brain of the user. The FDA is in
the process of approving similar devices for human trials. [**Speech

being investigated as enabling technologies. The concept is still in the
early stages of research. Research has been demonstrated with epilepsy
patients, and the capability of decoding brain signals for ASR

#### No intelligent AI

Neuroscience, University of Sheffield. The Conversation, \"Worried about
AI taking over the world? You may be making some rather unscientific
assumptions\", 9/24/2018, https://theconversation.com/worried-about-ai-taking-over-the-world-you-may-be-making-some-rather-unscientific-assumptions-103561, accessed

[Should we be afraid of artificial intelligence]{.underline}? For me,
this is a simple question with an even simpler, two letter answer:
**[no]{.underline}**. But not everyone agrees -- many people, including
the late physicist Stephen Hawking, have raised concerns that the rise
of powerful AI systems could spell the end for humanity. Clearly, your
view on whether AI will take over the world will depend on whether you
think it can develop intelligent behaviour surpassing that of humans --
something referred to as "super intelligence". So let's take a look at
how likely this is, and why there is much concern about the future of
AI. [Humans tend to be afraid of what they don't
understand]{.underline}. Fear is often blamed for racism, homophobia and
other sources of discrimination. So it's no wonder [it also applies to
new technologies]{.underline} -- they are often surrounded with a
certain mystery. [Some]{.underline} technological [achievements
seem]{.underline} almost [unrealistic]{.underline}, clearly [surpassing
expectations and]{.underline} in some cases [human
performance]{.underline}. But [let us demystify]{.underline} the most
popular AI techniques, known collectively as "[machine
learning]{.underline}". These allow a machine to learn a task without
being programmed with explicit instructions. This may sound spooky but
the truth is it is all down to some rather mundane statistics. The
machine, which is a program, or rather [an algorithm, is designed with
the ability to **discover relationships within provided
data**]{.underline}. There are many different methods that allow us to
achieve this. For example, we can present to the machine images of
handwritten letters (a-z), one by one, and ask it to tell us which
letter we show each time in sequence. We have already provided the
possible answers -- it can only be one of (a-z). The machine at the
beginning says a letter at random and we correct it, by providing the
right answer. We have also programmed the machine to reconfigure itself
so that next time, if presented with the same letter, it is more likely
to give us the correct answer for the next one. As a consequence, [the
machine over time improves its performance and "learns]{.underline}" to
recognise the alphabet. In essence, [we have programmed the machine to
exploit common relationships in the data in order to achieve the
specific task]{.underline}. For instance, all versions of "a" look
structurally similar, but different to "b", and the algorithm can
exploit this. Interestingly, after the training phase, [the machine can
apply the obtained knowledge on new letter samples]{.underline}, for
example written by a person whose handwriting the machine has never seen
before. [Humans, however, are good at reading]{.underline}. Perhaps a
more interesting example is Google Deepmind's artificial Go player,
which has surpassed every human player in their performance of the game.
It clearly learns in a way different to humans -- playing a number of
games with itself that no human could play in their lifetime. It has
been specifically instructed to win and told that the actions it takes
determine whether it wins or not. It has also been told the rules of the
game. By playing the game again and again it can discover in each
situation what is the best action -- inventing moves that no human has
played before. Now does that make the AI Go player smarter than a human?
Certainly not. [AI is very specialised]{.underline} to particular type
of tasks and [it doesn't display]{.underline} the
[versatility]{.underline} that humans do. Humans develop an
understanding of the world over years that no AI has achieved or seem
likely to achieve anytime soon. The fact that AI is dubbed "intelligent"
is ultimately down to the fact that it can learn. But [even when it
comes to learning, it is no match for humans]{.underline}. In fact,
[toddlers can learn by just watching somebody solving a problem once. An
AI]{.underline}, on the other hand, [needs tonnes of data and loads of
tries to succeed on very specific problems,]{.underline} and [it is
difficult to generalise its knowledge on tasks very different to those
trained upon]{.underline}. So while humans develop breathtaking
intelligence rapidly in the first few years of life, the key concepts
behind [machine learning are not so different from what they were one or
two decades ago.]{.underline}

AI has been the subject of countless popular TV shows and movies over
the years-just not in a relatively positive way. In these shows, it
always seems like artificial intelligence will decide to completely wipe
out humanity and civilization from existence. It\'s a bleak
\"prediction,\" but does it actually have any basis in reality?
According to several scientists, [the feared dangers of **AI
aren\'t**]{.underline} much of **[an existential threat]{.underline}**
to humanity as a whole. And that depends on one thing: whether it is
even possible for us to create artificial intelligence way smarter than
we are, writes ScienceAlert. The AI that exists right now is pretty
powerful in its own right. It is what\'s being used for things like
self-driving cars, facial recognition software, and even Google
recommendations. But the thing with current-gen [AI is]{.underline} that
it\'s considered \"[narrow\" or \"weak]{.underline}.\" While this kind
of [artificial intelligence]{.underline} is already quite good,
[they\'re often only capable of doing one thing
exceptionally]{.underline}, according to LabRoots. [If you try to make
them do something else]{.underline} while doing something they\'re good
at, these [AIs will fail]{.underline} because [they lack the necessary
data]{.underline} to perform it. Current-generation artificial
intelligence still falls short of tasks that will always require
abilities that only humans possess, writes Forbes. For instance,
[experienced surgeons are still the best choice]{.underline} for
performing surgeries, [with their fine motor skills and skill at
perceiving individual situations]{.underline}. [You]{.underline} also
[can\'t use an AI to replace HR professionals]{.underline}, because the
job will require a deep, intrinsic understanding of human reactions that
a machine just doesn\'t have, no matter how \"advanced\" it might be. It
is these kinds of situations where combining machine and human
intelligence still reigns supreme. [The human element provides the
machine with the necessary context]{.underline}, while the latter is put
to work crunching numbers and giving recommendations. In an article by
The Conversation, they put this specific argument forward. [A machine
can always \"learn\" if it is fed data about the task it\'s meant to
achiev]{.underline}e. Sure, it can process information much faster than
a human can (and perhaps even come up with solutions no person can ever
think of), but [it doesn\'t make the machine smarter than a human at
all]{.underline}. Here\'s one situation where machine learning is still
way behind human learning. Take [a toddler]{.underline}, for instance.
That child [can learn how to do a specific task within seconds just by
watching somebody do it. A machine can only learn something if it is fed
an extremely massive amount of data, which it uses when performing
trial-and-error]{.underline} according to Synthesys. At the end of the
day, [it still falls on the human element of the issue]{.underline}. You
should be far more scared of how humans use artificial intelligence, and
not the AI itself. This is considering the technology\'s capability to
draw conclusions from whatever data is being fed to it and how it can
only focus on one task at a time. In other words, an [AI trained to do
something good, like identifying climate change tipping points, is not
dangerous at all]{.underline}. But a machine which is trained in
something bad, like warfare, can be extremely perilous. So don\'t be
scared of robots taking over the world, because people-not the perceived
dangers of AI-will still be the most critical aspect of civilization\'s
downfall.

WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, Ohio [\-- Taking advantage of
Department of Defense research laboratory expertise in chemistry,
biology, computer science and material science and engineering, a
collaborative, **\$45 million** tri-service effort is changing the way
the DoD exploits biological systems to meet]{.underline} the unique
[needs and challenges of defense environments]{.underline}. The Applied
Research for the Advancement of Science and Technology Priorities
Program on Synthetic Biology for Military Environments, funded by the
Office of the Secretary of Defense, unites subject matter experts from
the Air Force, Army and Navy. The [effort is aimed at creating organic
capabilities and infrastructure for the use of synthetic biology in the
DoD as a key enabler for future defense technology.]{.underline}
Synthetic biology, though well established in industry, is still a
relatively new field of application for the DoD. This [interdisciplinary
field]{.underline} combines the understanding of how genes operate and
are organized in cells with engineering principles, to [modify organisms
for beneficial applications in areas such as **performance
augmentation**, sensor development and materials synthesis, to name a
few]{.underline}. "There are consumer products on the market that depend
on this technology. We're trying to grow its use in the DoD," said Dr.
Claretta Sullivan, a research scientist at the Air Force Research
Laboratory's Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, who is also the
Tri-Service Program Manager for SBME. "[Our team is looking at ways we
can reprogram cells]{.underline} that already exist in the environment
to create environmentally friendly platforms [for generating molecules
and materials beneficial for defense needs."]{.underline} By leveraging
the subject matter expertise based in each of the DoD research
laboratories, [the SBME program seeks to establish a multi-functional,
joint capability in synthetic biology, ultimately creating an ecosystem
that ensures the U.S. military remains at the forefront in the
field]{.underline} as it applies to defense objectives. Nearing the end
of the first of three years, [the program is already facilitating a
higher level of technical awareness and cooperation among the Service
Labs. At its end, enduring capabilities and expertise in synthetic
biology will be the program's legacy for years to come.]{.underline}
"This provides us with the opportunity to create that cross-cutting
infrastructure and ensure there is effective communication between the
DoD labs," said Dr. Rajesh Naik, the SBME lead based at the AFRL's 711th
Human Performance Wing. "[We have the smarts within the DoD when it
comes to SynBio, but we are now developing the infrastructure and
community to exploit the advantages for our needs]{.underline}."
According to Naik, with synthetic biology as a field that is a "mile
wide and a mile deep," the SBME team recognized a need to focus their
technical efforts and resources early in the program planning process to
best enable success and continued collaboration beyond its end. An
Executive Steering Committee with representation from each of the
service labs was established to oversee three focused task teams, each
of which is led by a different service lab. They are augmented by a
technical advisory group comprised of external academic, industrial and
federal partners who advocate for the SBME team in the larger community.
It's a complex arrangement, but it is critical to ensuring focused
efforts on program priorities. "Keeping the team in close communication
is a challenge. We have regular meetings and virtual telecoms nearly
every week," said Sullivan. "The fact that the team members are able to
do this is remarkable and reflects their commitment to do good science
and the best work possible for the DoD." The three SBME task teams
combine the expertise, capabilities and tools from each of the service
labs into a single, focused effort to meet the aim of a task effort. For
example, the Navy Laboratory is leading a tri-service task team focused
on developing systems biology tools in an open systems architecture,
with the goal of creating a set of collaborative tools to enable SBME
applications. Another task, led by the Air Force, is working to develop
and prototype a cell-based system that is optimized for use in military
environments. The Army labs are leading the effort to develop cell-free
platforms for testing and delivering the genetic components. The task
teams are comprised of members from each of the different service
laboratories, which facilitates a larger knowledge base and broader set
of tools accessible to the group. [A strong focus on standardizing
protocols and methodologies pervades all of the task efforts to ensure
effective information sharing across the domain.]{.underline} "The
program is really beneficial in helping to make sure that different
service labs do not replicate the same efforts. We can take advantage of
the work that is going on across the labs and within the overall SynBio
community," said Dr. Banahalli Ratna, Naval Research Laboratory. Though
this collaborative effort is less than one year old, the members are
already seeing the upshots of their efforts. In addition to
standardizing protocols and enterprise sharing environments, [several
scientific publications have resulted from collaborative efforts within
the group, and a working demonstration of a complicated, responsive gene
network which operates in a simulated environment is expected to be
delivered by the end of the effort.]{.underline} Additionally, the Air
Force, Army and Navy Research Laboratories will each field a team for
the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Foundation's
iGEM Competition in Boston, November 2017. This international
competition enables high school and college-aged student teams to
compete as they address problems using synthetic biology, ultimately
evolving the field and contributing to the future of the science in this
area. The competition not only augments the scientific field, but adds a
healthy dose of fun and competition to the SBME community. \"This
Tri-service investment is allowing Army, Navy and Air Force to each
field their own iGEM teams for the first time. This gives us a healthy
dose of fun competition," said Dr. Peter Emanuel, a senior scientist for
biological engineering for the Army. In the end, the SBME program is a
unique, dedicated effort committed to advancing the field of synthetic
biology by leveraging the expertise embedded in each of the military
research laboratories to the benefit of our nation's warfighters across
the spectrum. "[**The DoD represents the largest research and
development effort within the federal sector**,]{.underline} and we're
spread out over Air Force, Army and Navy bases that may be hundreds of
miles apart. [This program has made me more aware of the capabilities in
the DoD than ever before\--without this awareness, leveraging of
capabilities would never be possible," said Emmanuel.]{.underline}

Technologies such as artificial intelligence ([AI]{.underline}),
[autonomous weapons systems, big data,]{.underline}
**[biotechnologies]{.underline}** [and quantum technologies are changing
the world, and]{.underline} the way [NATO]{.underline} operates. These
and other emerging and disruptive technologies (**[EDT]{.underline}**)
[present]{.underline} both [risks and opportunities for NATO and
Allies]{.underline}. That's why **[the Alliance is working with public
and private sector partners, academia and civil society to develop and
adopt new technologies, strengthen the Allied industrial base and
maintain NATO's technological edge]{.underline}**. [Emerging and
disruptive technologies are increasingly touching all aspects of
life]{.underline} -- from electronics like phones and computers, to
everyday activities like shopping for food in the grocery store and
managing money in the bank. [These]{.underline} technologies [are also
having a profound impact on security]{.underline}. Innovative
technologies are providing new opportunities for NATO militaries,
helping them become more effective, resilient, cost-efficient and
sustainable. [These]{.underline} technologies, however, also [represent
new threats from state and non-state actors, both militarily and to
civilian society.]{.underline} To embrace these opportunities and at the
same time counter these threats, [NATO is working with Allies to develop
innovative and agile EDT policies that can be **implemented** through
real, meaningful activities. By working]{.underline} more closely
[with]{.underline} relevant partners in **[academia and the private
sector,]{.underline}** NATO aims to maintain its technological edge and
military superiority, helping deter aggression and defend Allied
countries. [Emerging and disruptive technologies are]{.underline} also
[a key facet of the NATO 2030 initiative]{.underline}, an initiative to
strengthen the Alliance militarily, make it stronger politically and
adopt a more global approach. NATO 2030 is about making sure that the
Alliance remains ready to face tomorrow\'s challenges. Promoting
transatlantic cooperation on critical technologies is a vital component
of that work. In February 2021, [NATO]{.underline} Defence [Ministers
endorsed]{.underline} "Foster and Protect: NATO's Coherent
Implementation Strategy on Emerging and Disruptive Technologies." This
is NATO's overarching strategy to guide its relationship to EDTs and has
two main focuses: [fostering the]{.underline} [development and adoption
of dual-use technologies]{.underline} (i.e. technologies that are
focused [on commercial markets and]{.underline} uses, but may also have
[defence and security applications]{.underline}) that will strengthen
the Alliance's edge, and [creating a forum]{.underline} for Allies [to
exchange best practices]{.underline} that help protect against threats.
NATO's innovation activities currently focus on nine key areas: The
Alliance is developing specific plans for each of these areas, starting
with AI and data, which will be implemented by Allies and by NATO's
Innovation Board. In October 2021, NATO Defence Ministers endorsed the
first of these strategies, NATO's Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategy.
The AI Strategy centres around principles of responsible use for AI in
defence and their operationalisation. It also outlines how the Alliance
will adapt AI capabilities and protect Allied citizens against their
use. Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA) At
the 2021 NATO Summit in Brussels, Allied Leaders agreed to launch the
Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic
(**[DIANA]{.underline}**) to [foster **transatlantic cooperation** on
critical technologies, promote **interoperability** and **harness
civilian innovation** by **engaging with academia and the private
sector**]{.underline}. DIANA includes a network of more than 10
Accelerator sites and over 50 Test Centres in innovation hubs across the
Alliance. The Accelerator works directly with leading entrepreneurs,
from early-stage start-ups to more mature companies, to solve critical
problems in defence and security. [DIANA will launch competitive
Challenge Calls]{.underline} based on critical defence and security
problem sets, fostering the most impactful technological solutions
developed by the best and brightest entrepreneurs from across the
Alliance. Innovators that are accepted into DIANA will gain access to
non-dilutive financing (investment capital that does not require them to
give up equity or ownership in their company). They will also [gain
access to]{.underline} a network of top-tier trusted [investors,
business mentorship and education]{.underline} from DIANA's expert
staff, state-of-the-art testing opportunities, and the possibility for
development and adoption contracts with Allies for proposed dual-use
technologies. [DIANA will]{.underline} begin [pilot]{.underline}
activities [as early as summer 2023]{.underline}. [Once fully
operational in 2025, it will]{.underline} have the capacity to [interact
with hundreds of innovators each year]{.underline} across an even wider
network of Accelerator sites and Test Centres throughout the Alliance.
NATO Innovation Fund NATO Leaders also agreed at the 2021 Brussels
Summit to establish **[a NATO Innovation Fund]{.underline}**. The EUR 1
billion venture capital fund will [provide strategic investments in
start-ups]{.underline} developing dual-use emerging and disruptive
technologies in areas that are critical to Allied security. The Fund
will be the world's first multi-sovereign venture capital fund. Many
start-ups working on deep technologies (transformational technologies
that solve important challenges through the convergence of breakthrough
science and engineering) struggle to attract sufficient investment
because of lengthy time-to-market timelines and the high capital
intensity of their research. The NATO Innovation Fund will tackle this
problem by leveraging its unique position as a patient investor with a
15-year run-time better suited to the extended time horizons necessary
for deep-tech start-ups. It will focus on early-stage investments (i.e.
pre-seed through Series A and follow-on), providing risk capital
directly into these start-ups, while also having the ability to invest
in other top-tier deep-tech venture capital funds that align with the
Fund's three strategic objectives: All NATO Allies currently have the
opportunity to opt-in to the Fund, whose list of participating countries
will be finalised at the NATO Summit in Madrid in June. The Fund is
scheduled to be up and running shortly thereafter, with its initial
investments expected in the first quarter of 2023. NATO Advisory Group
on Emerging and Disruptive Technologies **[The NATO Advisory Group on
Emerging and Disruptive Technologies]{.underline}** is an independent
group that [provides external advice]{.underline} to NATO on how it can
optimise its innovation efforts. The Group, established in July 2020,
consists of 12 experts from the private sector and academia across the
Alliance who have led cutting-edge research, developed EDT policy and
managed innovation programmes. These experts provide their
recommendations to NATO's Innovation Board. The Group provided four
initial recommendations to NATO: improve technology literacy throughout
the Organization; establish a network of Innovation Centres; design and
facilitate new financing mechanisms for innovation with private sector
entities, both small and large; and create innovation partnership
initiatives with external EDT stakeholders from industry and academia.
In its second annual report, the Group examined three critical, ongoing
work-strands aimed at enabling NATO and Allies to adopt new technologies
at pace and maintain a technological edge: DIANA, the Innovation Fund
and the Human Capital Innovation Policy (which contains recommendations
for NATO on how to attract, retain and develop talented employees with
technical skills and innovation mindsets). The forthcoming report aims
to identify the unique features of NATO endeavours in these domains,
suggest metrics of success for each, and outline issues and risks that
need to be considered. The Advisory Group will continue to provide
concrete short- and long-term recommendations on NATO's approach to
emerging and disruptive technologies. **[NATO's Innovation
Board]{.underline}** NATO's Innovation Board is chaired by the Deputy
Secretary General and [brings]{.underline} together [high-level civilian
and military leadership]{.underline} from across the Alliance. The
purpose of the Board is to look at new ideas from outside of the
Organization, provoke discussion, foster adoption of best practices and
secure cross-NATO support for changes that will help NATO innovate. This
includes receiving recommendations from the NATO Advisory Group on
Emerging and Disruptive Technologies. Other **[NATO innovation
bodies]{.underline}** Other NATO bodies are also invested in the
Alliance's innovation activities, and [are driving technological
development and adoption across NATO.]{.underline} Allied Command
Transformation (**[ACT]{.underline}**) leads capability development for
NATO and Allied militaries, and is currently working on a large range of
EDT-related projects, including on unmanned autonomous vehicles,
military-grade blockchain applications, and artificial intelligence in
military decision-making. NATO's Science and Technology Organization
(**[STO]{.underline}**) also supports numerous EDT-related research
projects, including on augmentation technologies for improving human
performance, autonomous transport and medical systems for casualty
evacuation, and space weather environmental modelling. NATO's Science
for Peace and Security Programme (**[SPS]{.underline}**), the Centre for
Maritime Research and Experimentation (**[CMRE]{.underline}**), and the
NATO Communications and Information Agency (**[NCIA]{.underline}**) are
also key nodes in NATO's innovation ecosystem as the Alliance adapts to
and adopts EDTs. [NATO's focus on EDTs is]{.underline} [**strongly
linked** to cooperation with partners in **the public and private

To carry out its missions and tasks, NATO needs Allies to invest in
interoperable, cutting-edge and cost-effective equipment. To that end,
NATO plays an important role in helping countries decide how and where
to invest in their defence. The Alliance also supports Allies in
identifying and developing multinational cooperative projects to deliver
the key defence capabilities needed for Alliance security. [There are
currently 18 projects underway that will deliver]{.underline} improved
**[operational effectiveness]{.underline}**, **[economies of scale and
connectivity]{.underline}** [among NATO Allies and
partners]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} projects
[address]{.underline} **[key capability areas]{.underline}** such as
air-to-air refuelling, ammunition, maritime unmanned systems, command
and control, and training. In addition, countries continue to discuss
promising areas for multinational cooperation in order to provide
cost-effective security. [Command and control]{.underline} Command and
control (**[C2]{.underline}**) consists of the leadership and direction
given to a military organisation in the accomplishment of its mission.
C2 is key in carrying out any NATO operation successfully and makes the
operation work smoothly and efficiently. The projects below present
examples of how C2 can be handled at a multinational level. [Composite
Special Operations Component Command]{.underline}
(**[C-SOCC]{.underline}**) [Special Operations Forces]{.underline} today
increasingly [operate in a multinational context]{.underline}. This is
why having [a multinational headquarters for their management is
key]{.underline}. NATO Allies Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands
agreed to create a tri-national command -- C-SOCC -- which, after having
become fully operational at the end of 2020, is participating in the
NATO Response Force and could also be responsible for supporting
multinational missions as well as NATO operations. [Regional Special
Operations Component Command]{.underline} (**[R-SOCC]{.underline}**)
Four Allies -- Croatia, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia -- and NATO
partner Austria have agreed to put together, [under Hungarian
leadership]{.underline}, [a regional deployable headquarters to manage
Special Operations]{.underline}. Regional NATO Special Operations Forces
across the Alliance will provide clear benefits in terms of speed and
resilience to respond to arising crises. R-SOCC reached its Initial
Operational Capability in May 2021, and Full Operational Capability is
expected to be reached by the end of 2024. [Command and Control
Capability for **Surface Based Air and Missile Defence**]{.underline}
for the Battalion and Brigade Level (SBAMD C2 Layer) The SBAMD C2 Layer
project aims to facilitate the potential acquisition and fielding of an
air defence management solution to enable a layered surface-based air
and missile defence approach. The commonly acquired SBAMD C2 Layer
capability will reduce the number of systems currently in use by NATO
Allies and therefore increase interoperability and resilience. This HVP
involves eight NATO Allies: Denmark, France, Hungary, Italy, Portugal,
Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. **[Training
structures]{.underline}** All Allied forces -- whether on land, in the
air or at sea -- need good training to confront a variety of security
challenges and to perform their duties. Multinational training enables
forces of different Allies to train together, improve coordination and
cooperation, and increase their readiness. [Multinational Special
Aviation Programme]{.underline} (**[MSAP]{.underline}**) [Special
Operations Forces are]{.underline} a highly [valuable]{.underline} and
versatile tool for effectively responding to evolving security threats.
To further strengthen NATO in this domain, four Allies -- Bulgaria,
Croatia, Hungary and Slovenia -- have decided to create [a Multinational
Special Aviation Programme]{.underline} (MSAP) [dedicated exclusively to
training aircrews]{.underline} who will conduct the insertion and
extraction of Special Operations Forces. This training facility,
stationed in Zadar, Croatia, is being established in a gradual manner,
expanding the training opportunities offered over time. The aviation
training centre officially opened its doors on 11 December 2019,
contributing to NATO\'s adaptability and readiness. The first group of
students graduated from a first training module in October 2020. [NATO
Flight Training Europe]{.underline} (**[NFTE]{.underline}**) [Delivering
state-of-the-art pilot training]{.underline} is an increasingly costly
and challenging endeavour. For many European Allies, the national pilot
requirements needed each year are too small to justify the establishment
or maintenance of national flight centres. To overcome this challenge,
the NFTE initiative aims to create a network of multinational training
facilities for fighter jet, helicopter, fixed wing, and drone pilots
across Europe, leveraging already existing structures to the maximum
extent possible. The establishment of the NFTE will significantly
decrease the current reliance on US training facilities by making
European Allies capable of training their own flight crews in a
multinational context. As such, the NFTE serves as an excellent example
of transatlantic burden-sharing. In the margins of the 2021 NATO Summit
in Brussels, 10 Allies -- Belgium, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary,
Italy, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Spain and Türkiye -- signed
a Memorandum of Understanding for NFTE, under which the first two
training campuses have since been established, namely in the Czech
Republic and Italy. [**High-end acquisition** Equipment]{.underline}
used in NATO operations and missions [differs in size and
cost]{.underline}. While some types of equipment are small and
affordable, other capabilities may be too big or too expensive for
single countries to operate in an economically viable way.
[Countries]{.underline} are [cooperating on]{.underline} several
[high-end projects]{.underline} that [they could not afford
individually. Multi Role Tanker Transport Capability]{.underline}
(**[MRTT-C]{.underline}**) The MRTT is [a multi-function aircraft that
can serve to transport cargo, troops and as an aerial refuel
tanker]{.underline}. Air-to-air refuelling tankers are especially
critical for the projection of air power. As they are a pooled asset,
interoperability is essential. The MRTT-C project enables the six
participating Allies -- Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Norway -- to collectively acquire Airbus
A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport aircraft and establish a
multinationally owned and operated fleet of MRTTs. The first aircraft
was delivered in June 2020 and the last delivery is scheduled in 2024.
For this initiative, NATO and the European Union (EU) joined forces, as
both organisations identified shortfalls in air-to-air refuelling and
the participating Allies, with the exception of Norway, are also members
of the EU. As such, it is an example of the close cooperation between
NATO and the EU. [Maritime Multi Mission Aircraft]{.underline}
(**[M3A]{.underline}**) When it comes to maritime defence and security,
it is vital for NATO to [provide continuous situational awareness and
anti-submarine warfare capabilities.]{.underline} As a shared starting
point for future implementation activities, eight NATO Allies -- Canada,
France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Spain and Türkiye -- created
under the Maritime Multi Mission Aircraft project (M3A) a common set of
requirements. France and Germany took a first step forward by starting
to develop a Maritime Airborne Warfare System (MAWS), which will serve
as a maritime situational awareness tool. [Maritime Unmanned
Systems]{.underline} (**[MUS]{.underline}**) An increasingly important
capability to secure NATO\'s ability to actively respond to threats in
[the maritime area is unmanned]{.underline} systems. To [facilitate
multinational cooperation in this area, 16 NATO Allies]{.underline} --
Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the
Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Türkiye, the United
Kingdom and the United States -- and NATO partner Australia have [joined
forces]{.underline} via the MUS initiative to develop tailor-made
solutions including, but not limited to, [systems for detecting and
clearing mines, and tracking submarines. Next Generation
Rotorcraft]{.underline} (**[NGRC]{.underline}**)
[Helicopters]{.underline} -- or, more broadly, vertical lift
capabilities -- [are an integral enabler for the operations of Allied
forces]{.underline}. Yet, a large percentage of helicopters in service
are based on models introduced as far back as the 1960s. To ensure that
NATO maintains its technological edge in this area, five Allies --
France, Germany, Greece, Italy and the United Kingdom -- signed a Letter
of Intent in October 2020 to develop and acquire the next generation of
medium multi-role helicopters, ready for an in-service date in the
2035-2040 timeframe. The Netherlands joined the NGRC project in June
2022, bringing the number of participating Allies to six. Through NGRC,
Allies will benefit from advances not only in airframe and propulsion
technology (including hybrid and electric options), but also in the
digital infrastructure of the capability, ensuring that helicopters and
other vertical lift vehicles will be ready to serve Allied forces for
the next decades. [Modular Solution for Ground Based Air Defence
Capabilities]{.underline} (**[Modular GBAD]{.underline}**) NATO has been
working for years to [strengthen its air and missile defence
capabilities]{.underline} in order to protect its populations, territory
and forces against increasingly sophisticated air threats. The Modular
GBAD effort includes 15 Allies -- Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany,
Hungary, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal,
Slovenia, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. It aims to
jointly develop and acquire a flexible and scalable GBAD system to
counter air threats at very short, short and medium range. The system
will be designed around a common Command and Control backbone. Due to
its modular nature participants will be able to design tailored GBAD
force packages for individual operations. [Rapidly Deployable Mobile
Counter Rockets, Artillery and Mortar]{.underline}
(**[C-RAM]{.underline}**) Effective [protection]{.underline} of Allied
forces and forward-deployed bases [against rockets, artillery and mortar
threats]{.underline} is a key requirement to ensure NATO\'s readiness.
The C-RAM initiative launched in October 2020 by four Allies -- Germany,
Greece, Hungary and the United Kingdom -- aims to develop and procure a
rapidly deployable capability to detect and destroy incoming rockets,
artillery and mortar rounds in the air, before they hit the ground. A
particular focus will be on exploring highly innovative solutions to
reduce operational cost while increasing resilience of the systems
against high-volume attacks. **[Ammunition]{.underline}** [Ammunition is
an essential part of every military operation]{.underline}. In order to
ensure NATO Allies and partner countries are well equipped, four
projects have been launched at multinational level. [Air Battle Decisive
Munitions]{.underline} (**[ABDM]{.underline}**) This project is [a
multinational framework for acquiring all air battle decisive munitions
and aims to increase the **flexibility in stockpile management** by
reducing legal and technical obstacles for sharing and exchanging
munitions]{.underline} among the 14 participating Allies -- Belgium, the
Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands,
Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, the United Kingdom
-- and partner country Finland. This is enabling the Alliance to bridge
the interoperability gap in this area, which NATO first encountered
during its operation in Libya, as well as support the European Allies in
reducing dependence on the United States when it comes to air missions.
This framework has, so far, already delivered significant cost and time
savings to its participants through several rounds of multinational
acquisition. [Land Battle Decisive Munitions]{.underline}
(**[LBDM]{.underline}**) Modelled after its parent project above, the
LBDM project [creates a multinational framework for acquiring munitions
for land domain]{.underline}. It currently [gathers 20 Allies and three
partner countries]{.underline} -- Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic,
Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro,
the Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia,
Slovenia, Spain, the United Kingdom, as well as Austria, Finland and
Sweden -- making it the largest of the High Visibility Projects. It
increases the Alliance\'s ability to share munitions and work more
smoothly in the field. Over time, this initiative will help troops
increase their interoperability and effectiveness, harmonise munitions
inventories and enable participants to operate seamlessly and
effectively together. [Maritime Battle Decisive Munitions]{.underline}
(**[MBDM]{.underline}**) NATO Allies Belgium, France, Italy, the
Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and partner country Finland
[agreed to combine munitions purchases in the maritime domain, including
surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, torpedoes and gun
shells]{.underline}. The potential establishment of common warehousing
solutions could lower costs even further. This effort presents an
important first step towards creating European stockpiles of
high-quality maritime munitions that meet the Alliance\'s evolving
needs. [Multinational Ammunition Warehousing Initiative]{.underline}
(**[MAWI]{.underline}**) [Ammunition storage is a vital element of
NATO\'s stockpile planning]{.underline} and a key enabler for NATO
operations. In the aftermath of the 2021 NATO Summit in Brussels, Allied
Defence Ministers from a number of countries started this initiative to
define a single operational principle under which the participants can
create and operate a wide range of warehousing solutions for Allies and
partners. The scalable, expandable and flexible approach gives
participating countries the option to adapt the storage solution to
their needs while benefitting from significant cost reductions. The MAWI
includes 10 Allies -- Belgium, Estonia, France, Greece, Italy, the
Netherlands, Norway, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain -- as well as the NATO
Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA). **[Chemical, biological,
radiological and nuclear]{.underline}** ([CBRN]{.underline})
**[defence]{.underline}** Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear
(CBRN) [agents represent complex threats and distinct
challeng]{.underline}es to NATO and Allied security. [Three
multinational projects]{.underline} have been launched to help Allies
[coordinate training, share information and acquire
equipment]{.underline} that will increase the level of preparedness
amongst Allied CBRN defence forces. [Network of CBRN Defence
Facilities]{.underline} (**[CBRN-DF]{.underline}**) In October 2021,
nine NATO Allies agreed to establish [a framework to connect various
CBRN defence facilities within a single architecture]{.underline}. This
will help make the capabilities of these centres -- which range from
live agent training sites to analytical laboratories -- more widely
available across the Alliance. Participants include Belgium, Greece,
Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom and
the United States. [CBRN Protection Equipment]{.underline}
(**[CBRN-PE]{.underline}**) The CBRN Protection Equipment HVP [provides
10 participating NATO Allies]{.underline} -- Albania, Belgium, Greece,
Hungary, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and
the United States -- [with a framework to jointly procure individual
protective gear and collective protection systems for their military
units and personnel]{.underline}. This project was agreed in the margins
of the NATO Defence Ministers\' meeting in October 2021. [CBRN Detection
and Identification]{.underline} (**[CBRN-D&I]{.underline}**) Similar to
the above project for the procurement of protection equipment, the CBRN
Detection and Identification HVP [provides participating Allies with a
framework to jointly develop and procure more advanced solutions for
detecting and identifying CBRN agents.]{.underline} This project was
agreed in the margins of the October 2021 meeting of NATO Defence
Ministers by nine Allies: Albania, Belgium, Greece, Italy, Latvia, the
Netherlands, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Allies
are constantly exploring new multinational initiatives to develop, in
the most cost-efficient way, the key capabilities the Alliance needs to
face today's security challenges. In the same vein as the Smart Defence
initiative launched by then NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen
in 2012, multinational capability cooperation is also helping the
Alliance develop, acquire and maintain capabilities in a cost-effective
and efficient manner. [NATO's High Visibility Projects]{.underline}
(**[HVPs]{.underline}**) [focus on delivering the most critical
capabilities in an accelerated manner by creating political commitments
in the form of agreements signed by defence ministers]{.underline}. An
initial document, also called a Letter of Intent (**[LOI]{.underline}**)
-- outlining the general cooperation idea -- is signed by the defence
ministers involved in the project. It is [followed by the signature of
a]{.underline} Memorandum of Understanding (**[MOU]{.underline}**), a
legally binding document specifying the details of cooperation. The MOUs
provide the necessary legal framework for the execution of the
implementation phase towards the delivery of the specific capability.
The high-level political involvement dramatically increases the
prospects of expedient and tangible progress. [In]{.underline} the
implementation phase of [most projects]{.underline}, the NATO Support
and Procurement Agency (**[NSPA]{.underline}**) [is the intermediary
between the countries and industry]{.underline}. This can happen at
different levels: [NSPA can invite industry to present
solutions]{.underline} for Allies and partners to acquire, be involved
in the procurement process, or even negotiate on behalf of countries
with industry. [The Conference of National Armaments
Directors]{.underline} (**[CNAD]{.underline}**) -- the senior NATO
committee that [brings together the top national officials responsible
for defence procurement in NATO member and partner countries -- is also
involved in multinational capability cooperation]{.underline}. It is
tasked with identifying collaborative opportunities for research,
development and production of military equipment and weapons systems,
and is responsible for a number of [cooperative armaments
projects]{.underline} that aim to [equip NATO forces with cutting-edge
capabilities]{.underline}.

pressure]{.underline}**," [she
said](https://www.cbr.ru/eng/press/event/?id=12858). **[Gross domestic
product is expected to nosedive by a minimum of 8%]{.underline}** this
year, **[and could even shrink by as much as 10%, the most since
1994]{.underline}**, according to the World Bank. Nabiullina dismissed
the Russian government\'s [rosy first-quarter GDP
figure](https://interfax.com/newsroom/top-stories/78752/), which showed
an expansion of 3.7%, as nothing more than a temporary effect driven by
people stocking up on goods before they disappear. **[As inventories
gradually run out, the damage will continue to worsen]{.underline}**
over the course of the year and peak in the final three months of this
year, according to her analysis. The central bank governor singled out
the country's auto industry, with its complex cross-border supply
chains, as a prime casualty of the sanctions. "**[Companies that used
foreign raw materials or components are facing problems as they are
gradually running out of stocks]{.underline}**,\" she said. No V-shaped
recovery next year Like many emerging economies dependent on raw
material exports, Russia has had other sharp contractions before: The
country\'s output experienced a 3% decline during the 2020 pandemic and
a 7.8% drop in 2009 following the global financial crisis. But **[even
in Nabiullina\'s more optimistic scenario, she estimates that this
year\'s plunge in GDP following Western sanctions will easily top
those]{.underline}**, if not blow them out of the water. Making matters
worse, **[Nabiullina predicted the economy would not snap back next
year]{.underline}**, as it had done previously. Instead, in a best-case
scenario, it would stagnate on an annual basis in 2023, and at worse
decline by a further 3%. Consumer prices could soar by 18% to 23% this
year, with the rate of increase only set to cool significantly from next
April, the bank forecasts. On Friday, **[Russia\'s [main interest
rate](https://www.cbr.ru/eng/press/pr/?file=29042022_133000Key_eng.htm)
fell to 14%,]{.underline}** although it still remains elevated compared
to the 9.5% [just prior to February's
invasion](https://www.cbr.ru/eng/press/pr/?file=11022022_133000Key_eng.htm).
But whether the latest cut will help animate people to spend money

WASHINGTON: Prices for the next batch of Lockheed Martin's
[F-35]{.underline} Joint Strike [Fighters will]{.underline} probably
[be]{.underline} higher than the last, the Pentagon's F-35 program head
said today. However, it's premature to say that the cost of the F-35A
conventional takeoff and landing variant, which is used by the US Air
Force and most international customers, will once against come in above
the Pentagon's cost goal of [\$80 million a copy]{.underline}, Lt. Gen.
Eric Fick told reporters at a roundtable. "I think it's likely that
we'll see costs rise on a tail by tail basis. I think it's early to say
where I think that they'll end up," Fick said. For about a year,
Lockheed and the Defense Department have been embroiled in negotiations
over F-35 Lots 15 through 17, which will roughly include about 400

rising inflation and the cost of supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic

pointed to oncoming Block 4 upgrades and a potentially smaller order as
cost drivers. "It's proven more difficult than we expected to reach
agreement on a cost baseline that incorporates the impacts that we see
associated with our customer ordering fewer aircraft in Lots 15-17 than
were ordered in the prior buys of 12-14," John Mollard, Lockheed's
acting chief financial officer, said in January, according to Air Force

#### Turn--Russian revisionism pushes Turkey [towards]{.underline} the West

[While discontent with the West and anti-Westernism have facilitated
cordial and cooperative relations between Moscow and Ankara, **Russian
geopolitical revisionism has almost invariably pushed Turkey closer to
the West.**]{.underline} The logic here is straightforward. First,
[Russian revisionism poses direct security threats to
Turkey.]{.underline} Historically, the centre of gravity of
Turkish-Russian rivalry has been the Black Sea. From the Turkish
perspective, [Russia's actions -- from the war in Georgia to annexation
of Crimea and the invasion of Ukraine -- all decisively **tilt the
balance of power** in this region in Russia's favour.]{.underline}
Although Russia's policy in each of these cases might have specifics and
con­textual nuances, taken together they point to one unmistakable
outcome: Russian revisionism in the post-Soviet space and an aspiration
to turn the region into a sphere of domination. This will only aggravate
the Turkish threat perception vis-à-vis Moscow. Second, the post-Soviet
space is also Tur­key's immediate neighbourhood. If success­ful, the
[Russian policy will restrict Ankara's geopolitical room for manoeuvre
in this region, and undermine its standing from the Black Sea to the
Balkans and the South Caucasus to Central Asia.]{.underline}
Additionally, [**Turk­ish and Western interests are in broad align­ment**
in these regions]{.underline}, so Moscow's geo­political revisionism is
likely to bring Tur­key and the West relatively closer together.

This week at their Madrid summit, NATO allies formally invited Finland
and Sweden to join the Alliance. [It was the latest step in a whirlwind
process initiated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and **delayed by
Turkey**---home to the second-largest military in the Alliance, after
the United States---which argued that the Nordic countries did not
sufficiently address Turkey's national-security concerns.]{.underline}
After weeks of tough negotiations, Turkey, Finland, and Sweden agreed to
a breakthrough trilateral declaration on Tuesday. Atlantic Council IN
TURKEY asked experts for their take on the implications of the summit
and the trilateral declaration. Jump to an expert reaction Mehmet Fatih
Ceylan: [A victory for NATO unity and cohesion Ian Brzezinski: **Erdogan
recognizes NATO brings far more geopolitical value than
Russia**]{.underline} Rich Outzen: The summit brings Turkey's security
concerns to the fore **[A victory for NATO unity and
cohesion]{.underline}** The ongoing Russian aggression in Ukraine since
2014 has entirely changed the security landscape, not only in the
Euro-Atlantic area, but globally. It has fundamentally altered threat
perceptions beyond the Alliance, leading Finland and Sweden to
officially apply for membership in NATO. These two countries have indeed
crossed the Rubicon and deserted their neutrality in response to
persistent Russian belligerence in the middle of Europe. Their decision
to combine their efforts and assets with the Alliance against Russian
aggression is natural and legitimate. Hence the need to incorporate
Finland and Sweden into the Alliance family. The trilateral memorandum
signed among Turkey, Finland, and Sweden on June 28 is a welcome
development designed to demonstrate NATO's solidarity and unity, and
further strengthen the Alliance. [It is commonplace in NATO to consult
on and negotiate over any dispute among allies and would-be allies to
find a common ground. That is how NATO plays its role, and at the end a
solution accommodating such concerns is found by consensus.]{.underline}
It is also true that once new members accede to NATO, they are bound by
the decisions previously taken by the Alliance on a wide range of
subjects. In NATO there exists a robust set of decisions and practices
in fighting terrorism, beginning with the intervention in Afghanistan.
Therefore, there is already an agreement comprising all sorts of
conceptual work and practices in different geographical theaters on
combatting terrorism, developed within NATO and binding on all members.
[The newly adopted **Strategic Concept (SC) clearly** **identifies
Russia** and "terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations" as the
primary sources of threats]{.underline} in a 360-degree manner and
across all three core tasks of NATO: collective deterrence and defense,
crisis prevention and management, and cooperative security. Given that
terrorism is "the most direct asymmetric threat to the security of our
citizens and to international peace and prosperity," as defined in the
SC, it makes sense both for Finland and Sweden to cooperate with Turkey
in combatting terrorism as one of the primary sources of threats against
Alliance interests. In a nutshell, collective deterrence and defense
against actual and potential adversaries, nipping crises in the bud, and
expanding the web of networks with partners under challenging
circumstances are the main tasks of NATO in the next decade. The main
center of gravity for NATO is its solidarity, unity, and cohesion,
including all allies and those set to become allies. The summit
decisions in their entirety will help NATO to navigate the troubled
waters ahead over the long term. ---Mehmet Fatih Ceylan is the president
of Ankara Policy Center and previously served as permanent
representative of Turkey to NATO. [Erdogan recognizes NATO brings far
more geopolitical value than Russia At their summit in Madrid, NATO
leaders decided to "invite Finland and Sweden to become members of NATO,
and agreed to sign the accession protocols."]{.underline} This was an
important breakthrough. Until now, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan had held up the protocols on the grounds that the two Nordic
nations had embargoed his nation from defense sales and refused to
extradite alleged Kurdish terrorists. Consensus was facilitated by a
meeting between US President Joe Biden and Erdogan---a bilateral long
sought by the Turkish leader---and memorialized via a trilateral
Turkey-Sweden-Finland memorandum in which the latter two agreed to lift
the embargoes, condemn the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) as a terrorist
organization, "address" Turkey's pending extradition requests, and
support Turkey's involvement in European Union defense initiatives. The
breakthrough underscored the influence and leadership of the United
States in NATO. There is no way Erdogan would have lifted his veto
solely due to European pressure. [It also reflects Erdogan's recognition
that NATO brings Turkey far more geopolitical value than Russia, which
would savor seeing this Nordic bid for NATO membership fail. Consensus
on Finland and Sweden's applications also demonstrated **the Alliance's
unity in the face of Russia's aggression** and the difficulty Moscow
still has when it comes to fully peeling Erdogan away from the
transatlantic community.]{.underline} Once again, Putin's strongest
relationship in the Black Sea region has proven to be far more
transactional than strategic. With that said, Turkey, like all the other
NATO allies, still has to ratify these accession protocols. There
remains ample opportunity for Erdogan to introduce additional
negotiations with the rest of NATO. I am optimistic that Sweden and
Finland will become NATO members, but it is still too early to say this
round of NATO enlargement is a done deal. ---Ian Brzezinski is a senior
fellow at the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and
Security and previously served as US deputy assistant secretary of
defense for Europe and NATO policy. The summit brings Turkey's security
concerns to the fore **[The summit was a great success for
Ankara]{.underline}** for three distinct reasons. The first is the
content of the trilateral memorandum signed with Sweden and Finland: No
arms embargo on Turkey, an affirmed commitment to address Turkish
security concerns, no aid to the PKK or (significantly) the Kurdish
People's Defense Units (YPG), the Gulen movement mentioned as a terror
concern, collaboration on the defense industry, working groups to
follow---it's hard to see what they missed. Of course, these are
statements of principle, and execution or a final commitment will play
out over time. But that is as true for Ankara approving accession as it
is for the specified cooperation. The second reason is the ringing
endorsement from the White House not only for the trilateral memorandum,
but for the strengthening of Turkish air power and specifically a
commitment to press Congress to approve F-16 fighter jet sales and
upgrades. Notably, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has already weighed in
with a strong endorsement of the deal. The in-person meeting of
presidents Biden and Erdogan was notable, too. The third reason is more
subtle: the inclusion in the new, slimmed-down Strategic Concept of
language on countering terrorism "in all its forms and manifestations."
[This language, and the prominence given both terror concerns and the
Russian military threat, address Turkish concerns and highlight **the
value Turkey adds to the Alliance.**]{.underline}

[A second area where **Turkey's immediate security concerns intersect
with the majority of other NATO members** is stability in the Middle
East, most immediately in Syria]{.underline}. To be sure,
[Turkey's]{.underline} anger over United States' partnership with the
YPG in the fight against the Islamic State---[appnd NATO's]{.underline}
anger at Turkey for its unilateral incursion into northern Syria---will
make progress difficult. But ultimately, the two **[sides share a mutual
interest in seeing stability and pluralistic governance in
Syria.]{.underline}** This entails constraining Syrian president Bashar
al-Assad; preventing the return of the Islamic State and Europe-based
Islamic State fighters; and facilitating the delivery of humanitarian
aid, reconstruction, and refugee return. More broadly, [both sides also
share an interest in limiting Russian and Iranian influence in the
region.]{.underline} With the Russian military presence in Armenia,
Azerbaijan, and Crimea now supplemented by the Russian naval base at
Tartus, airbases at Kobani and Khmeimim, and helicopter base\[s\] at
Qamishli, Turkey is effectively encircled by Russia. It is in this
context that German minister of defence Kramp-Karrenbauer's suggestion
of [an internationally-controlled security zone along the Turkey-Syria
border, possibly NATO-led]{.underline} and backed by the United Nations
in loose partnership with Russia, makes sense. It [would address a
situation that immediately and directly affects the security of Europe
and Turkey and demonstrate that]{.underline} the **[NATO is invested in
addressing Turkey's security concerns]{.underline}**. Should NATO and
Turkey move to restore some level of trust by taking these first steps,
it will be important to avoid unnecessarily escalating tensions. For
Turkey, this means abiding by the terms of the Syria ceasefire, not
pursuing additional purchases of Russian military equipment, and doing
its part to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State in the region or
return of Islamic State foreign fighters to Europe. For the United
States and Europe, the trick will be to apply the required sanctions and
arms embargoes in a discriminate way. For example, whereas imposing
sanctions in accordance with the Countering America's Adversaries
Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) and withholding delivery of Turkey's
F-35s due to its purchase of the Russian S-400 makes good policy sense,
imposing additional blanket sanctions could do more harm than good,
affecting the Turkish people more than their leadership and giving
Erdogan another opportunity to blame the West for Turkey's economic
problems. A smarter approach might involve going after corrupt actors
using the Global Magnitsky Act. Similarly, a total arms embargo by the
United States and the European Union will only drive Turkey to procure
more Russian or non-NATO interoperable military equipment. Rather, the
arms embargoes should be limited along the lines of the most recent
House sanctions bill, which includes exemptions for items to be used in
NATO-approved operations. Finally, as some of Turkey's biggest export
partners, the European Union and the United States can provide needed
carrots along the way to incentivize constructive behavior by Ankara.
[Measures might include an eventual upgrade of Turkey's customs union
with the European Union or limited visa-free travel to EU countries for
Turkish citizens.]{.underline} For the United States, President Trump's
offer of a \$100 billion trade deal will also be attractive to Erdogan
in Turkey's struggling economy. To be sure, repairing the trust that has
been lost and returning Turkey to the path of Western integration will
be a struggle, requiring sustained effort, and a setting aside of egos,
on all sides. Yet on this occasion of NATO's 70th anniversary, Turkey
and its NATO allies owe it to one another to pause for a moment and
reflect not on their many disagreements but on what brought them
together in the first instance and why that still matters.

#### Turkey and NATO have a common interest in stopping enemy encroachment--that serves as a motivator within the alliance

**Congressional Research Service 21** (Congressional Research Service,

Turkey's location near several global hotspots has made the continuing
availability of its territory for the stationing and transport of arms,
cargo, and personnel valuable for the United States and NATO. [In
addition to Incirlik Air Base near the southern Turkish city of Adana,
other key U.S./NATO sites include an early warning missile defense radar
in eastern Turkey and a NATO ground forces command in Izmir]{.underline}
(see Figure A-3). From Turkey's perspective, [**NATO's traditional
importance has been to mitigate Turkish concerns** about encroachment by
neighbors, as was the case with the Soviet Union's aggressive post-World
War II posturing.]{.underline} Some similar Turkish concerns---though
somewhat less pronounced---may stem from Russia's ongoing regional
involvement in places such as Syria and Ukraine, and may partly motivate
recent Turkish military operations to frustrate some Russian objectives
in various conflict arenas.86 As a result of growing tensions between
Turkey and Western countries, and questions about the safety and utility
of Turkish territory for U.S. and NATO assets, some observers have
advocated exploring alternative basing arrangements in the region.87
Some reports suggest that expanded or potentially expanded U.S. military
presences in places such as Greece, Cyprus, Jordan and Romania might be
connected with concerns about Turkey.88 Additionally, Turkish actions in
opposition to the interests of other U.S. allies and partners in the
Eastern Mediterranean (see "Cyprus, Greece, and Eastern Mediterranean
Natural Gas" below)--- particularly over the past two years---have led
U.S. officials to encourage cooperation among those allies and
partners.89 In 2020, the Trump Administration waived restrictions on the
U.S. sale of non-lethal defense articles and services to the Republic of
Cyprus, effectively ending a U.S. arms embargo that had dated back to
1987, and attracting criticism from Turkish officials.90 [Turkey's
influence in the Black Sea littoral region and its relationships with
European countries bordering Russia make **its actions in this sphere
important for U.S. interests**.]{.underline} Ongoing Turkish defense
cooperation with or arms sales to Ukraine, Poland, Georgia, and
Azerbaijan may present opportunities to make renewed common cause
between the United States and Turkey to counter Russia.91 Alternatively,
Turkey's interactions with these other countries could possibly check
both U.S. and Russian ambitions, or increase regional tensions
potentially leading toward conflict.92 A case in point will be how
Turkey regulates and controls other countries' maritime access to and
from the Black Sea---a limited privilege granted to Turkey in the
Montreux Convention of 1936 (with provisions to give Turkey greater
control when at war).93

#### Russia cant help turkeys economy, they're in a recession of their own

**Carbonaro 6/30** (Giulia Carbonaro, US News Reporter, 6/30/22,
"Russia\'s Economy is Collapsing, Data Reveals",

[If Russia defaulting on its foreign debt for the first time since the
Bolshevik revolution wasn\'t a clear enough sign of the impact Western
sanctions are having on the Russian economy, a new report on the
country\'s socio-economic situation leaves no margin for doubt that the
Russian economy is gradually collapsing.]{.underline} New statistics on
the state of the Russian economy, produced by the country\'s Federal
State Statistics Service, show production has plunged in multiple
sectors, from vehicles to domestic appliances, as has retail confidence.
[Overall, Russia\'s industrial production index---a monthly economic
indicator measuring real output in the manufacturing, mining, electric,
and gas industries---dropped by 1.7 percent in May compared to the same
month in 2021. That\'s higher than the decline of 1.6 percent
year-on-year reported in April.]{.underline} Mining dropped by 0.8
percentage points in May 2022 compared to May 2021, and manufacturing
dropped by 3.2 percentage points. [The overall numbers seem quite
modest, but they reflect a downward trend that is more obvious in the
staggering drops affecting the production of specific
products.]{.underline} Above all, car production has suffered, and it\'s
now down by 96.7 percent compared to 2021. Production of trucks plunged
by 39.3 percent, that of diesel and gasoline engines by 57 percent, that
of diesel locomotives by 63.2 percent and that of freight wagons by 51.8
percent. French automaker Renault, which controls Russia\'s largest
carmaker AvtoVAZ, suspended operations at its Moscow plant in March,
under pressure from Ukrainian leaders to act in response to Russia\'s
invasion of Ukraine. Renault later agreed to sell its Russian operations
for a nominal payment. Air cargo is down by 86 percent year on year.
Other products were also affected. The production of fridges is also
down by 58.1 percent compared with 2021 levels, that of washing machines
by 59.2 percent, that of AC electric motors by 49.9 percent. TV sets
were down by 49.7 percentage points. Production of elevators is down by
34.7 percent and that of excavators was down by 60 percent. Curiously,
cigarette production also dropped by 24.5 percent. Graphs show that
retail turnover and retail confidence have also gone down compared to
one year before and even from the beginning of 2022. Wholesale turnover
has also plunged drastically, with consumer demand dropping in what is
likely a reflection of lower wages amid high inflation in the country.
Even more significantly for the Russian population, pensions have also
fallen in real terms, decreasing by 8.2 percentage points year-on-year
in May, while salaries dropped by 7.2 percentage points in April
compared to a year prior. [These data are a clear sign that the Russian
economy is suffering, despite the fact that the rouble bounced back
after collapsing in late February following the invasion of Ukraine and
that the country has held up surprisingly better than expected after
Western sanctions were imposed.]{.underline} The drop in industrial
production is less than Western economists expected, but the economic
contraction of the country is still undeniable. Even the Russian central
bank said it expected a fall in GDP of 7.8 percent this year, almost in
line with Western predictions but not quite, as Western experts estimate
that the country\'s economy will shrink by 15 percent by the end of the
year, according to the Institute of International Finance\'s (IIF). One
piece of unexpected good news for Russia came from the jobs market, with
a record-low unemployment rate of 3.9 percent reported in May. And yet,
as high inflation continues to cripple wages in Russia, it\'s unlikely
this high employment will turn into higher consumer demand able to turn
the tide of Russia\'s likely incoming recession.

[Turkey's official inflation rate increased to almost 80% last month --
the highest in 24 years -- as President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's
unconventional economic policies continued to drive up the cost of
living. The growth in annual prices rose from 73.5% in May to 78.6% in
June, according to the Turkish statistics agency. However, opposition
parties and economists said recent hikes in oil and gas prices meant the
real rate of inflation was almost double the official
figure]{.underline}. The minister of treasury and finance, Nureddin
Nebati, has attempted to head off criticism of the government's handling
of the economy, saying last week that consumer prices would start
dropping by the end of the year. "I promise to you and to the president,
we will see a drop in inflation starting in December," Nebati said. His
comments came after the government announced its second increase in the
minimum wage in six months, raising pay by 30%. The increase lifted the
monthly salary of about 40% of the workforce from \$254 (£209) to \$328.
Erdoğan has claimed that Turkey's problem is not inflation. "We do not
have an inflation problem. We have a cost of living problem," he said
last month. [Economists said Turkey's official data disguised a more
disturbing trend of rising prices that had shown no sign of abating. A
monthly report release by Turkey's ENAG group of independent economists
showed consumer prices had risen by 175% in June compared with a year
earlier. ENAG said prices had risen by 71.4% since the start of 2022.
The Istanbul chamber of commerce said inflation in Turkey's largest city
had reached an annual rate of 94%. "No one actually believes official
Turkish data any more," said Timothy Ash, an economist at BlueBay Asset
Management. "There is no expectation of anything like a credible policy
response]{.underline}." The growing dispute over the veracity of
Turkey's official data is expected to be a difficult political issue for
Erdoğan's government ahead of next year's general election, which is
widely viewed as the toughest of his two-decade rule. Kemal
Kılıçdaroğlu, the leader of the main opposition party, accused the state
statistics agency of "lying", urging it in a tweet to "stop committing
crimes for the benefit of President Erdoğan." A survey published by the
Metropol polling agency on Friday showed 69% of respondents believed the
unofficial ENAG figure and just 24% the one reported by the government.
[Turkey was hit hard by the fallout from the European debt crisis in
2012 and the threat of higher interest rates by the US Federal Reserve
in 2013. Its currency tumble ever since.]{.underline} In 2013 the lira
was worth 36p, compared with 4.9p on Monday. To arrest the decline, in
2018 Erdoğan embarked on what he called a "new economic model", which
meant setting aside rising inflation and cutting interest rates to boost
economic growth. This was done against the advice of his central bank
chief and caused the lira to plunge to a record low, pushing up costs in
a country that is dependent on imported materials, especially energy.
[Inflation, which officially stood at 15% at the beginning of 2021, has
now reached its highest level since a currency meltdown during the 1998
debt crisis that helped bring Erdoğan to power. Three central bank
bosses have been fired by the president since 2018. The Turkish lira has
plummeted 20% this year alone.]{.underline}

[Turkish inflation reached almost 80 per cent as analysts warned that

year in June, the fastest increase since 1998, as President Recep Tayyip
Erdoğan's unconventional monetary policy and the impact of the war in
Ukraine took a heavy toll. The rate was slightly below the consensus
forecast of analysts of 80 per cent. [Erdoğan]{.underline}, who [rejects
the widely accepted view among economists that raising interest rates
curbs inflation]{.underline}, has ordered the central bank to keep its
benchmark borrowing rate far below the level of inflation. As a result,
the lira has lost 48 per cent of its value against the dollar over the
past 12 months. The plunge in the currency has been a major driver of
price rises in a country that is reliant on imports, especially energy.
It has been compounded by a surge in the price of energy and other
commodities in the wake of Russian president Vladimir Putin's invasion
of Ukraine. The latest inflation data, up from 73.5 per cent in May,
come days after Turkish authorities announced a 30 per cent increase in
the minimum wage --- six months after raising the basic rate of pay 50
per cent. The Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs recently

WASHINGTON [-- The pertinent and unanswerable question about Turkey is
**whether the country's present economic turmoil is an isolated event**,
mostly confined to Turkey itself, **or whether it portends a larger
economic convulsion that shakes markets around the world.** Among
economists and other experts, there's no consensus. Some foresee
contagion: Turkey's problems will spread. Others envision a one-country
economic blip. **Which is it?**]{.underline} The answer obviously
matters. The global economy already faces obstacles to growth. American
interest rates are rising as the Federal Reserve tries to prevent higher
inflation. President Trump's trade wars are threatening. If we now add a
slowdown of "emerging market" economies -- China, Brazil and similar
"middle-income" nations -- the global expansion might sputter or halt.
[Turkey's experience is relevant. In recent months, its currency, the
lira, has collapsed. At the start of 2018, it was trading at roughly 4
lira to the dollar; now that's about 6 lira to the dollar.]{.underline}
This makes it harder for Turkish businesses and consumers to repay
debts, which -- more than in many other countries -- are often made in
dollars. To repay these debts, Turkish companies need to earn more lira,
which can be sold for dollars. The more lira go to repay dollar debts,
the fewer lira are left over to buy other things. Economic growth slows.
If debtors can't raise the dollars to repay their loans, they default.
Too many defaults, and growth stops. Turkey's debt problems are
undeniably daunting, notes economist Hung Tran of the Institute of
International Finance (IIF), an industry research and advocacy group.
Consider: Between now and the end of 2018, Turkey faces debt repayments
-- principal and interest -- of about \$120 billion; in 2019, the total
is about \$200 billion. By comparison, Turkey's economy -- gross
domestic product -- is about \$850 billion. Some of these loans could be
rolled over; how many is unclear. Many debts were incurred by banks or
private firms, encouraged by easy-money policies. The government pumped
up the economy in the wake of a failed military coup in 2016 and in
anticipation of a new election. The election was held in June 2018 and
won by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He was surely helped by the
economic stimulus. Last year, Turkey's GDP grew 7 percent, up from 3.2
percent in 2016. To complicate matters further, Turkey and the Trump
administration are feuding over the Turks' detention of Andrew Brunson,
an American pastor accused of anti-state activities. Now comes the
reckoning. [Many observers believe that what happened in Turkey **will
stay in Turkey.** Its economy is simply too small -- about 1.4 percent
of global GDP, according to some estimates -- to influence the rest of
the world. "**It's mainly a Turkish issue**," says economist C. Fred
Bergsten of the Peterson Institute. He doesn't expect large spillover
effects, say a slowdown of growth in Europe or capital flight from other
"emerging market" countries, such as Brazil or India.]{.underline} Not
all economists are so hopeful. Writing in The Hill, Desmond Lachman of
the American Enterprise Institute predicts that ["Turkey will **default
on its debt** and impose capital controls." Capital controls are legal
restrictions on money movements in and out of a country. He expects
contagion -- capital flight from heavily indebted countries -- **that
will weaken the global recovery and hurt the U.S.
economy**.]{.underline} Economist Tran of the IIF thinks that
emerging-market countries that have problems similar to Turkey's -- poor
policies, maturing debts, sizable current account deficits -- are the
most vulnerable to capital flight. These include South Africa, Indonesia
and Egypt. [So far, the evidence is reassuring; the IIF's most recent
survey of capital movements didn't detect any sizable money surges since
the lira's latest large drop.]{.underline} Crowd psychology could
trigger a panic. If investors expect other investors to sell, there
could be a stampede for the door. This story isn't over yet. [What's
uncontroversial, at least among many economists, is that **Turkey will
need to go to the IMF to end the present crisis**. The]{.underline} IMF
would provide a hefty loan -- it's doubtful anyone else would -- and
impose "tough austerity policies" designed to improve the economy's
performance, says Jacob Funk Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute. By
their nature, these policies would be unpopular, especially with
Erdogan, because they "could weaken (his) hold on power," as Kirkegaard
puts it. It seems likely that he would resent and resist them as long as
possible. That could change everything. Stay tuned.

#### Turkish economy [resilient]{.underline}--hyperinflation is [normal]{.underline} for the economy

**Balcells 2-11** (Francesc Balcells is running the Global EM Debt Fund
at FIM partners. Formerly at PIMCO for eight years, managing EM hard and

resilience has defied worst fears", Financial Times,
<https://www.ft.com/content/1d8fd6dd-e951-49a1-bffa-b2c361c2d16a//BVN>
SC)

[The warnings back in 2011-2013 were ominous: "If the Turkish lira
breaks through 2 against the dollar, the economy will implode." Once the
2 was reached, the new implosion target moved to 3, then to 5, and here
we are at 13. **The economy is still standing**.]{.underline} An economy
with debt in dollars as high as Turkey's should seemingly have imploded
a long time ago under such currency volatility. The history of emerging
markets is littered with balance of payments crises under similar
foreign exchange depreciations. There might be several reasons for this
resilience. For one, up until earlier this year, [the Turkish
authorities did what they always had done in the past when confronted
with capital outflows and currency weakness: interest rate hikes, if
only belatedly and often in an obfuscated manner. **This boom-and-bust
way of managing the economy kept the system going for quite some
time**.]{.underline} That time is what gave economic actors the chance
to build buffers against an unbalanced economy. [Banks, for example,
kept balance sheets largely hedged on currency. By virtue of a build-up
of dollar deposits and a low level of foreign currency loans made
relative to them, banks also had excess dollars.]{.underline} So they
kept lending dollars to obtain cheap lira funding, creating in the
process another safety mechanism for themselves. But it hasn't been only
banks which have built resilience over time. [As dollarisation
progressed, households have continued to accumulate dollar assets but no
foreign exchange liabilities. This is because banks were forbidden to
lend foreign currency to households, **making them a lot more resilient
to currency risk**.]{.underline} This was perhaps the regulators'
greatest foresight. The creditor profile of the country has also changed
over time. Fickle portfolio flows have greatly reduced. Foreigners used
to own nearly 30 per cent of the local debt market but this number is
now less than 5 per cent (a mere \$3bn in absolute terms). Meanwhile
locals now own almost 50 per cent of the country's sovereign Eurobonds.
This has left Turkey more dependent on different types of external
creditor --- the syndicated loan market, trade finance, intra-corporate
lending, or domestic lenders. These creditors are more patient, more
long-term oriented than foreign portfolio investors. [The passing of
time has also allowed Turkish corporates, the weakest link in the
country's external balance sheet chain, to **reduce debt levels**
somewhat while building a positive net short-term foreign exchange
position.]{.underline} The problem, however, remains one of
co-ordination. While on paper each economic sector has enough liquidity
buffers of its own, they are all "joined at the hip". One sector drawing
on its foreign exchange assets has a ripple effect on the entire system,
as those assets will be residing in someone else's balance sheet.
Against that, the country is tentatively turning its persistent current
account deficit into a surplus by virtue of the very large lira
depreciation which boosts exports and contracts imports. Whether this
turn in the current account, if it materialises, is yet another
boom-and-bust episode or a structural manifestation of a policy-driven
rebalancing of the economy remains unclear. [All in all, it's been **a
surprisingly resilient journey**, though longer than many of us would
have anticipated. Turks also have suffered from high inflation and a
squeeze in purchasing power in dollars.]{.underline} And the fact that
**[Turkey hasn't "broken" yet]{.underline}** doesn't mean it still
can't.

[Risks aside, Turkey boasts a large, diversified, **resilient economy
with a solid banking sector**]{.underline}, an executive at Moody's
Investors Service, a sister company of the global ratings agency, said
Monday. ["They (Turkish banks) have had pretty good results. They are
solid,"]{.underline} Kathrin Muehlbronner, senior vice president within
Moody's Investors Service Sovereign Risk Group, told Anadolu Agency
(AA), [citing "stabilizing factors."]{.underline} ["**Exporters are
benefiting clearly very much from the (Turkish lira's) depreciation**,"
she said, praising the country's "large diversified resilient
economy."]{.underline} She noted that [Turkey may benefit from supply
chain shifts]{.underline} in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
"Turkey can benefit massively from a nearshoring of production by
European companies and (from its) Customs Union with the EU." She said
prospects for Turkish economic growth are optimistic, adding: ["Exports
are doing well. Lira depreciation helps. There are clear incentives such
as credit stimulus for exporters and investments."]{.underline}
Muehlbronner welcomed steps by the Turkish government to shield the
poorest households from inflation. Propelled by rising energy and
commodity prices, [Turkey's annual inflation runs at a 20-year high of
nearly 70% as of April, according to official data.]{.underline}
Consumer prices have been increasing despite tax cuts on basic goods and
government subsidies for utility bills to ease the burden on household
budgets. After it took a hit from the pandemic like the rest of the
world, Muehlbronner said she expects the Turkish tourism sector to have
a good season. [She underlined that the **Turkish economy may grow
faster** than Moody's forecast of 3% this year.]{.underline} On
inflation, Muehlbronner said the upward trend stemmed from the weaker
lira, especially through end-2021 and elevated commodity prices. ["We
think inflation will drop kind of mechanically at the end of the year
because of a base effect,"]{.underline} Muehlbronner noted. Listing
risks to the Turkish economy, she said high inflation, currency pressure
and loose monetary policy create downside risks for the country. The
Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) is expected to hold its
key policy rate unchanged at 14% for the fifth straight month on
Thursday, according to surveys. Inflation has surged since last autumn
as the lira weakened after the central bank in September embarked on a
500-basis point-easing cycle. [The government's foreign
exchange-protected lira deposits tool]{.underline}, she said, ["was
certainly a good step to stabilize the currency. And it has **reduced
dollarization of deposits by around 10 percentage
points."**]{.underline} Muehlbronner was referring to the scheme that
the government unveiled in December to boost lira deposits by protecting
them against exchange rate volatility. Ankara has called on individuals
and companies to convert their foreign exchange savings to lira to
support the currency. ["So, we're back to the levels of share of
deposits and dollars that we had before the latest currency crisis. So
that's certainly a positive step,"]{.underline} Muehlbronner added.

### 2AC -- AT: Impact -- Ukraine War -- Internal Link

#### Non-unique--Turkey is mediating between Russia and Ukraine [now]{.underline}

**Kirby 22** (Jen Kirby, Foreign and National Security Reporter, April
1, 2022, "What diplomatic solution might end the war in Ukraine?",
<https://www.vox.com/2022/4/1/23002085/peace-talks-ukraine-russia-war-turkey-neutrality>//RM)

[The war in Ukraine has ground on for five weeks. For almost as long,
Russian and Ukrainian officials have been attempting to negotiate. Those
negotiations have yielded few firm results so far, especially as Russia
continues to bombard Ukrainian cities. Still, the talking matters.
Diplomacy is the only way this war will finally end, and the type of
agreement that might end the fighting looks a lot clearer than it did
even a month ago.]{.underline} In the early days of the war, the talks
made little apparent progress. Ukraine appeared to be demanding an
immediate ceasefire, and Russian withdrawal of troops. Russia, however,
had pretty different ideas. It laid out some aggressive demands. Among
them were: Ukraine's neutrality and no membership in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO); so-called "demilitarization and
"denazification;" the protection of Russian language within Ukraine; and
that Ukraine recognize Crimea as part of Russia and recognize the
independence of Donetsk and Luhansk, the two regions in eastern Ukraine
that Vladimir Putin had declared as independent on the eve of his
full-scale invasion. [In recent days, some glimmers of optimism have
emerged. Ukraine has put forward serious proposals, which is centered
around a commitment to permanent neutrality and an agreement not to seek
NATO membership, in exchange for security guarantees. Russia has also
reportedly eased up on some of its previous demands, including
"denazification" --- a likely ruse for regime change --- and
"demilitarization," a sign that Ukraine's battlefield successes so far
have pushed the Kremlin to possibly reconsider some of its most
maximalist demands. Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, who is
helping to broker the talks, described the discussions earlier in the
week as "the most meaningful progress since the start of
negotiations."]{.underline} But these really are just glimmers of
progress --- and they might not be so long lasting. Russia, this week,
promised to "drastically reduce" military activity around Kyiv and
Chernihiv, in the name of "mutual trust," though reports of shelling
continued in those areas. Some, including US and NATO officials, have
expressed skepticism that Moscow is sincere, and instead using talks to
buy time, so it can regroup and refocus its offensive, potentially on
areas in eastern and southern Ukraine. Since then, both Russia and
Ukraine have downplayed the seriousness of the talks, even as
negotiations resumed Friday. And huge gulfs remain. Perhaps the most
intractable problem may be the future of the Crimean peninsula, which
Russia annexed in 2014, and Donetsk and Luhansk, which Russia and
Russia-backed militias control parts of. Ukraine is unlikely to agree to
slice up its country. It is also hard to imagine Russia settling for
less territory than it controlled the day before its invasion in
February 2022. Other issues will emerge, and concessions and proposals
may shift depending on developments in the battlefield. The prospect of
a quick peace deal between Ukraine and Russia remains unlikely. Perhaps
the best case short term is that both sides broker a ceasefire that
includes a framework for an agreement, and then work the details out
over time. But the war continues.

[Russia claimed control Sunday over]{.underline} the key city of
[Lysychansk, the last major Ukrainian foothold in the Luhansk
region]{.underline} [--- signaling **a potential turning point in
Moscow's campaign** to take all of eastern Ukraine.]{.underline}
Ukrainian officials said their forces had withdrawn from Lysychansk
after fierce fighting to preserve lives from the Russians' relentless
assault[. The slow Russian advance across the region it has targeted
since the invasion began in February has been facilitated by
overwhelming artillery power that has leveled cities and towns and left
a trail of wounded and dead prompting comparisons with the devastation
of World War I in Europe.]{.underline} Russian Defense Minister Sergei
Shoigu said in a statement that Russian troops and pro-Kremlin
separatists of the self-declared Luhansk People's Republic "have
established full control" over Lysychansk "and a number of nearby
settlements." [The Ukrainian military's general staff said Sunday that
Ukrainian forces were forced to withdraw from Lysychansk after waging a
stiff but losing battle.]{.underline} Ukraine had tried to defend
Lysychansk for weeks[. The military said it decided to withdraw
because]{.underline} remaining in the city would bring "[fatal
consequences," given **the Russian forces' "overwhelming advantage**" in
"artillery, aviation, ammunition and personnel."]{.underline} The
decision was "made to save the lives of Ukrainian defenders," according
to a statement posted on Facebook. Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky vowed to return. "If the command of our army withdraws people
from certain points of the front where the enemy has the greatest fire
superiority, in particular this applies to Lysychansk, it means only one
thing: We will return thanks to our tactics, thanks to the increase in
the supply of modern weapons," Zelensky said in his nightly address
Sunday. "Ukraine does not give anything up." The city is a key target in
Russia's battle to capture the Donbas region, the heavily industrialized
area bordering Russia that is partly controlled by separatists loyal to
Moscow. In 2014, they unilaterally established two independent
"republics" in the Donbas region. 'They're in hell': Hail of Russian
artillery tests Ukrainian morale Russian President Vladimir Putin cited
false claims of Ukrainian "genocide" against Russian-speaking residents
there as justification for his invasion. Russia's latest advances in
eastern Ukraine add to creeping doubts among U.S. lawmakers and
observers of the war that the Ukrainian government can stop Putin from
seizing territory. [Optimism sparked by the defeat of his forces in the
battle for Kyiv in the spring has faded as **Russian artillery hammers
Ukrainian forces** and civilian targets. As Ukraine war bogs down, U.S.
assessments face scrutiny President Biden said last week that U.S.
support for Ukraine is unshakable and will continue "as long as it
takes" to ensure a Russian defeat. "We continue to fight. Unfortunately,
the steel willpower and patriotism are not enough to achieve success ---
**we need the technical resources**,"]{.underline} the Ukrainian
military's statement added. Why is Ukraine's Donbas region a target for
Russian forces? Ukrainian troops withdrew just over a week ago from
Severodonetsk, a city across the Donets River to the east. Russia's
capture of Lysychansk, if confirmed, would be a major victory that gives
its troops clear access to Donetsk, the other region that makes up
Donbas. Biden administration officials say Putin's gains have been
uneven and have come at a significant cost, highlighting the steep death
toll among Russian troops. But Ukrainian forces also are paying a heavy
price, which U.S. military officials rarely acknowledge. Ukraine
retreats from Severodonetsk as Russia advances in the east Control over
Donbas is the primary goal of Moscow's military operation in Ukraine,
after it failed to capture the capital, Kyiv, and other areas in the
initial weeks of the war. [Russian troops and their allies have been
making steady gains in the east, as officials in Kyiv say they are
outgunned and running out of ammunition.]{.underline} Ukrainian Defense
Ministry spokesman Yuriy Sak told the BBC earlier Sunday that Ukraine
controls other cities in Donetsk and argued that "the battle for the
Donbas is not over yet." Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk region,
said earlier in the day that in attacking Lysychansk, Russian fighters
used tactics even more brutal than in Severodonetsk to overcome
resistance. Photos showed bombed-out residential buildings in Lysychansk
early Sunday, amid a barrage reminiscent of the destruction of
Severodonetsk. As recently as Saturday, a Russian-backed politician said
Lysychansk was "completely surrounded," but defense officials in Ukraine
said they still had control of the city. Those counterclaims were
probably "outdated or erroneous," according to an analysis from the
Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank. It
cited unconfirmed videos showing Russian forces erecting a red "victory"
flag in Lysychansk and "casually walking around" its neighborhoods.
"Ukrainian forces likely conducted a deliberate withdrawal from
Lysychansk, resulting in the Russian seizure of the city on July 2," it
said. [As Russia issued its claim of control over Lysychansk on Sunday,
Slovyansk, a town about 50 miles west in Donetsk, came under intense
shelling]{.underline} that killed at least six people, local officials
said. Mayor Vadym Lyakh said in a video on Telegram that "the biggest
shelling of Slovyansk recently" had left "a large number of wounded and
dead." Tetyana Ignatchenko, a spokeswoman for the Donetsk region, told
Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne News that at least six people were
killed and 15 were injured in the shelling. She added that missiles hit
the town of Kramatorsk, to the south of Slovyansk. In its assessment
Saturday, [the ISW said Russia was likely to fully take over the Luhansk
region "in coming days" and would probably "then prioritize drives on
Ukrainian positions in Siversk before turning to Slovyansk and Bakhmut,"
in Donetsk]{.underline}. In other developments, Ukraine's ambassador to
Turkey said Sunday that Turkish authorities have detained a
Russian-flagged cargo ship loaded with stolen Ukrainian grain. Millions
of metric tons of grain await export from Ukraine, blockaded by Russia's
control of Black Sea shipping lanes. The export blockades have resulted
in global food shortages and rising prices, which have particularly
affected poorer countries. Three people were killed in Russian strikes
early Sunday in the Kharkiv region, Ukrainian officials said. Cities
across Kharkiv were shelled Saturday and Sunday, according to regional
governor Oleh Synyehubov. In one district, Russian forces "burned farm
buildings, garages, and shelled open areas," he added. Russian forces
have recently intensified their attacks on Kharkiv, and some

### 2AC -- AT: Impact -- Ukraine War

#### Putin [won't]{.underline} use nuclear weapons--NATO will [retaliate]{.underline} if he does

**Ullman 2/16** (Harlan Ullman, Harlan Ullman is an Atlantic Council
senior advisor and UPI's Arnaud deBorchgrave Distinguished Columnist,
2/16/22, "Why Putin won't invade Ukraine",
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/why-putin-wont-invade-ukraine/>

In regard to Ukraine, [Putin also knows that an armed attack or
aggressive use of force will make any chance of his achieving both his
priorities even less likely than landing an astronaut on the sun. He
also knows that the costs to Russia and to him personally will be high
and possibly unaffordable. Sanctions and further isolation will hurt.
Going to war, no matter the scope, or using cyber and influence
operations to cripple Ukraine, will absolutely foreclose any chance for
even part of Putin's demands being considered by NATO. The Alliance's
response to a major attack will make the actions it took after Russia's
2014 Crimean annexation appear anemic. It will expand its military
capability and the number of forces stationed in Europe---exactly the
opposite of Putin's intent. NATO members will develop and deploy more
advanced weapons, including new classes of missiles with low-yield
nuclear warheads.]{.underline} NATO badly needs a new strategic
framework (here, ironically, Putin is right for the wrong reasons). If
war breaks out in Ukraine, the Alliance will certainly move to a new
framework incorporating some of the actions mentioned above and announce
it during the Madrid summit in June---another outcome Putin won't like
one bit. [In an escalation, the West will impose sanctions more strictly
and robustly than before. How much this will dent Russia's economy or
Putin's inner circle is uncertain. But the Nord Stream 2 natural gas
pipeline will almost certainly be cancelled, denting Russia's energy
sector. Whatever credibility Putin may have gained will be lost given
the "big lie" of his assurances that force would not be used in Ukraine.
Of course, Russia will have accused the West of provoking violence
requiring an "appropriate response."]{.underline} If a subsequent
occupation of Ukraine were required, even of just a portion of the
country, body bags could be flowing back to Russia. And what is Putin's
exit strategy? No such plan following a Russian attack is obvious for
Moscow other than a prolonged twenty-first century version of the Cold
War, but one in which Moscow uses substantial force resulting in even
greater isolation. And that could doom Putin's rule in a way similar to
how Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev got fired two years after the
October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. An advantageous stalemate The
billion-ruble question is: How does this crisis end? Speculation over
invasion scenarios has ranged from a massive, overwhelming air, sea, and
land assault to a mix of cyber, special-forces, and influence-based
non-kinetic operations. Should Putin not grasp the predicament he has
imposed on himself, a limited move in the Donbas or seizing a land
bridge into Crimea would seem to be the lowest-risk and lowest-cost
option. He could then judge how NATO chooses to respond and wait. But
Putin would almost certainly suffer the same consequences as if he took
Kyiv and occupied much of the country. Assuming there is no military
action, Putin has two choices. First, he can prolong the crisis and
maintain the buildup on the Ukrainian border. That would be expensive
and wear down his forces. Staying on constant alert takes a toll on
people and pocketbooks. Or Putin could terminate the exercise with
Belarus on February 20 as scheduled, draw his troops back from the
Ukrainian border, claim victory, and continue to push for
negotiations---arguing that as the West wrongly predicted an attack, it
continues to fail to recognize Russian security interests and needs.
Russia will no doubt continue political and psychological pressure on
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to make concessions, either to
accept the Minsk 2 agreement (despite its grant of semi-autonomy to the
Donbas) or to suspend any request for NATO membership. And Russian
"active measures," such as disinformation campaigns, will continue to
target Ukraine with the aim of eroding Zelenskyy's standing and NATO
solidarity by claiming "hysteria" over an invasion that never occurred.
This scenario suits Putin's interests far better than an uncertain
military adventure, which is why he will choose it---and not because of
anything uttered from a White House podium, no matter how much credit
the administration will take for deterring a war.

#### Russia [won't escalate]{.underline} to nuclear weapons--they [lose]{.underline} China if they do

**Corera 4/26** (Gordon Corera, Security correspondent, BBC News, April
26, 2022, "Ukraine war: Could Russia use tactical nuclear weapons?",
<https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60664169>)

Putin claims Ukraine is part of Russia, so using nuclear weapons on its
territory seems bizarre. Russia itself is close by and \"the fallout
could cross boundaries\", warns Patricia Lewis. The only time nuclear
weapons have been used in conflict was by the US at the end of World War
Two against Japan. [Would Putin want to become the first leader to break
the taboo and use them? Some worry he has shown a willingness to do
things others thought he would not do, whether invading Ukraine or using
nerve agent in Salisbury. Dr Williams says there is a further reason why
Russia might not use nuclear weapons - China. \"Russia is heavily
dependent on Chinese support, but China has a \'no first use\' nuclear
doctrine. So if Putin did use them, it would be incredibly difficult for
China to stand by him. If he used them, he would probably lose China.\"
Could it lead to nuclear war? No one knows quite where the use of
tactical nuclear weapons would lead. It could escalate and Putin would
not want nuclear war. But miscalculation is always a risk. \"They would
imagine everyone would capitulate,\" says Patricia Lewis. \"What would
happen is that Nato would have to come in and respond.\"]{.underline}
The US says it is monitoring the situation closely. It has an extensive
intelligence gathering machine to watch Russian nuclear activity - for
instance whether tactical weapons are being moved out of storage, or if
there is any change in behaviour at launch sites. [So far, they say they
have not seen any significant changes. How the US and Nato would respond
to any nuclear use is hard to predict. They may not want to escalate the
situation further and risk all-out nuclear war but they also might want
to draw a line. This might mean a tough conventional rather than nuclear
response.]{.underline} But what would Russia then do? \"Once you have
crossed the nuclear threshold, there is no obvious stopping point,\"
says James Acton. \"I don\'t think anyone can have any confidence of
what that world would look like.\"

[**The Turkish government has designated the Russian invasion as a
"war,"** giving it the right under the 1936 Montreux Convention to close
the Bosporus Strait---which leads to the Black Sea---to
warships.]{.underline} Although this action applies to any naval vessel,
it is clearly aimed at Russia's fleet in case Moscow seeks to reinforce

important symbolic one **in support of Ukraine.**]{.underline} A Russian

Russian submarine sails in the Bosporus on its way to the Black Sea.
Despite the restrictions on warships in the Bosporus, it seems clear
that Turkey---like other countries including Israel---has sought a
strategically defensible but morally questionable middle ground. Though
[Turkey voted for a UN General Assembly resolution condemning
Russia]{.underline}, it has not sanctioned Russia or closed its airspace
to Russian aircraft. Some observers have been quick to highlight the
differences between Turkish policy and the definitive pro-Ukraine
approaches of the European Union (EU) and North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), implying that [Ankara is trying to have it both
ways---remaining rhetorically committed to Ukraine's independence and
offering to mediate the conflict while tilting toward Russia. There is
some logic to this, especially after the purchase of the Russian-made
air defense system known as the S-400. However, it is less a tilt than a
recognition that **Turkey's interests are intertwined with Russia in
critical areas**, most importantly Syria.]{.underline} There, Turkey
wants to prevent the emergence of a Kurdish state and maintain pressure
on the People's Protection Units (YPG), a group linked to the Kurdistan
Workers' Party (PKK), which the United States and Turkey have designated
a terrorist organization. To accomplish these goals, Turkish officials
have to consider Russian sensibilities, as Moscow is the most important
external actor in Syria and can thus complicate Turkey's military
operations there and frustrate its diplomatic efforts. In recent years,
Turkey has pursued what can best be described as foreign policy
independence. As an important power in the Mediterranean, the Middle
East, and the Caucusus, Ankara has sought a multifaceted foreign policy
that has, at times, conflicted with its NATO allies. For example, in
2017, Turkey decided to purchase S-400s. This step coincided with a
growing dialogue between Ankara and Moscow that included moves to
upgrade economic ties and discussions about deepening diplomatic and
even military relations. At the same time, Turkey and Russia have found
themselves on opposite ends of major regional conflicts, including in
Syria, Libya, and Nagorno-Karabakh, a region over which Armenia and
Azerbaijan fought a recent war. Even while they were supporting
different sides in these places, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan
and Russian President Vladimir Putin maintained a dialogue. What about
Ukraine? [**Turkey has generally supported Ukrainian independence and
the country's territorial integrity.** Erdogan denounced Russia's 2014
annexation of Crimea and has advocated on behalf of Crimean Tatars (a

### 1AR -- AT: UQ -- Russian Isolation

#### Russia has become both completely [politically and economically isolated]{.underline}

On 24 February 2022, [Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered a
full-scale military invasion of Ukraine. The decision was based on a
series of fatally flawed situational assessments, including an
overestimation of the fighting abilities of the Russian army, an
underestimation of the determination of the Ukrainian army and people,
and a faulty evaluation of the West's willingness to impose serious
economic sanctions. The massive sanctions that have since been imposed
on Russia's economy have led to a freeze on half of the central bank's
reserves, a fall in the value of the rouble of more than 40 per cent,
and an exodus of most Western companies from Russia. Increasing
political repression and a fear of border closures caused several
hundred thousand Russians -- a significant part of the country's
intellectual elite -- to flee abroad. The economic consequences of these
developments will be disastrous.]{.underline} At the moment, neither the
Russian government nor most Russian people seem to realise the extent of
the economic catastrophe that is already sure to happen. In the best
scenario, Russia's economy will shrink by 10 to 20 per cent this year, a
somewhat worse decline than during the 2008 financial crisis. But if
[the war continues, and new war crimes lead to additional sanctions, the
economic disaster might be comparable to that caused by the collapse of
the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. A self-inflicted catastrophe There
are few, if any, politicians in recent history who have inflicted such
massive harm on their own country in such a short time as Putin has done
in the last 20 days]{.underline}. Three weeks ago, Russia was a
middle-income country well integrated into the global economy, with a
large part of its population enjoying a standard of living comparable to
that of some European states. Russians could choose from a similar range
of consumer goods to people elsewhere in the world, occasionally travel
abroad for a holiday, and expect to lead a relatively stable and
peaceful life. Today, [Russia has become an almost completely isolated
pariah state]{.underline}. Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, and Syria were
the only countries that voted against a UN resolution condemning the
Russian war in Ukraine. According to a list compiled by researchers at
Yale University, by 13 March, 350 foreign companies had ceased or
curtailed their operations in Russia, with only 34 overseas firms
continuing to operate normally. As both Airbus and Boeing are no longer
servicing Russian planes, Russia's airlines were forced to stop
international flights and might soon be forced to stop domestic flights
as well. [Travel within the country will be pushed back to where it was
in the early twentieth century. It is unlikely that any of these
companies will return to Russia if the current situation continues or
deteriorates. As a consequence, the country will be deprived of many of
the high-technology and consumer goods it has been importing until now.
As Russia produces very few hi-tech goods, this will seriously affect
the Russian economy, disrupting supply chains and making the country's
situation similar to that of Iran during the last 30 years]{.underline}.
A similarly heavy blow will be the brain drain caused by the recent wave
of repression. Most of the hundreds of thousands of people who have fled
Russia in recent weeks are highly qualified specialists and researchers
who are difficult to replace. The remaining scientists in Russia will be
cut off from international networks, as worldwide academic institutions
have cut all ties with Russian universities. The consequences for
science, research, and innovation in Russia will be devastating. Dark
prospects for the future [Even in the best possible scenario of
immediate peace, it would take several years to repair the damage
already caused]{.underline}. Such a scenario would probably require the
fall of the Putin regime, and a new government that ends the war and
takes responsibility for Russia's actions, to open up the possibility of
bringing the country back into the international community. Even in this
highly unlikely scenario, however, [Russia's population will have
suffered substantial economic harm, and the horrors already committed in
Ukraine will leave deep scars for Ukrainians and Russians
alike]{.underline}. In what is unfortunately a more likely scenario, the
war will drag on for a considerable time, potentially leading to a
complete end of Western oil and gas imports from Russia. Although China
might be willing to jump in, Russia will not be able to significantly
increase its oil and gas exports in the near future, as the existing
infrastructure in the Far East is already operating at full capacity.
Moscow will thus have to rely on Chinese loans to import Chinese
consumer goods. As a result, [Russia might turn into some large-scale
version of North Korea: economically dependent on China and with a
government that through tight control of travel and information will try
to prevent its population from finding out the true reasons for the
disaster that has befallen it.]{.underline}

[From a strategic point of view, Putin's attack on Ukraine has thrown
back Russia to its weakest position since World War II. Ukrainians have
shown they are ready to fight and die, and that they will never accept a
Russian puppet regime]{.underline}. In a best-case scenario for the
Kremlin, Russia ends up controlling swaths of eastern Ukraine, including
a land corridor from Russia to Crimea, allowing Russian forces to
continue threatening Ukraine's Black Sea coastline and the country's
center. Yet even this state of play would hardly improve the Kremlin's
hand compared to what it was before the February invasion, when Russia
already occupied Crimea and had the Ukrainians tied down in a low-level
war in the eastern part of the country. Strategically speaking, the
status quo ante was favorable to Russia, since the simmering conflict
was draining Ukraine's scarce resources and hobbling its aspirations to
join the EU and NATO. Germany and France, signatories to the stalled
Minsk peace process, were uninterested in inflaming tensions with Russia
over Ukraine---as was the United States. After taking office, President
Biden tried to patch up relations with Moscow so that he could focus on
his main foreign policy priority, China. Biden held a summit with Putin,
refused to give Ukraine any clearer guidance on NATO membership, and
ignored calls to sanction Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline. In the leadup
to the attack, Putin, the eternal tactician, may have been under the
impression that he was on a roll in Russia's "near abroad." In 2020,
when mass protests broke out in Belarus, wedged between Poland, the
Baltic region, and Russia, Putin offered dictator Alexander Lukashenko
financial support and riot police. After a flare-up in a bitter
territorial conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan that same year, the
Kremlin inserted itself into the fight by dispatching Russian
peacekeepers to the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. In January the
Kremlin briefly deployed a Russian rapid-reaction force to Kazakhstan to
help a friendly regime shore up its authority amid antigovernment
demonstrations and violence. Though all are dependent on Russia, none of
the beneficiaries of recent Kremlin support has returned the favor by
actively backing the war against Ukraine. [Russia's Isolation To varying
degrees, Putin's attack on Ukraine sent shocks through every former
Soviet republic as Russia showed itself to be an unpredictable,
revanchist power. Russia's isolation in its own neighborhood has nothing
to do with NATO; its lack of true allies is a strategic disaster
entirely of Putin's own making. In light of their history as Soviet
vassals, the desire of former Warsaw Pact countries to join NATO was
understandable and, in view of what's happening in Ukraine, completely
sensible]{.underline}. On emerging from behind the Iron Curtain three
decades ago, these countries didn't have the luxury to wait and see
whether their former overlord would first develop into a peace-loving,
democratic neighbor. That the Russian establishment even before Putin
was opposed to NATO expansion is also understandable, given Russia's
past domination over Central and Eastern Europe. The irony is that NATO
membership for the region's small, insecure nations made Russia's
western border the most stable it has ever been. Although Putin
fulminated about U.S. missile defense installations in Romania and
Poland, it was unclear how they were supposed to neutralize Russia's
vast nuclear arsenal, the largest in the world. In fact[, before Russia
launched its first invasion of Ukraine in 2014, the United States was
drawing down its military presence in Europe and attempting to pivot to
Asia. The case of Ukraine is the most egregious example of how Russia's
postimperial phantom pains have clouded the Kremlin's strategic
thinking]{.underline}. Ukraine, with its close cultural, linguistic,
economic, and religious ties to Russia, should have been a natural ally.
While most Ukrainians were proud of their distinct identity, they were
generally well-disposed toward Russia and deeply ambivalent about NATO
before 2014. The Alliance itself was divided over Ukraine's membership
precisely because of the country's deep connections to Russia. Even as
Putin's attack on Ukraine eight years ago spurred the United States,
Britain, Canada, and Germany to send troops to NATO allies in Eastern
Europe, it did not solidify support for Ukrainian membership within the
Alliance. When Putin ordered a full-scale invasion in February, Ukraine
was not significantly closer to joining NATO than it had been in 2008,
when the issue was hotly debated, together with Putin, at the annual
NATO summit. What has changed since 2014 is that a majority of
Ukrainians support NATO membership and have no doubts that Russia has
become their mortal enemy. As for NATO, member states such as the United
States and Britain began arming and training the Ukrainian military.
[Putin's fears of an increased U.S. presence in Ukraine---and Eastern
Europe more broadly---became a self-fulfilling prophesy. The
reputational damage to Russia that Putin's belligerence has caused is
staggering. Finland and Sweden are considering NATO membership, and even
Switzerland has ended its traditional neutrality and adopted EU
sanctions against Russia. Germany, once Russia's most faithful partner
in Western Europe, is determined to stop relying on Siberian natural
gas, ending an energy relationship that began during the Cold War. Trust
and economic synergies that took decades to build have been sacrificed
for Putin's delusional war. The Kremlin may retort that it has friends
in other parts of the world. But even in the United Nations, Russia has
been ostracized, with a large majority of countries calling on Moscow to
end its offensive in Ukraine. Putin received explicit support only from
Belarus, Syria, Eritrea, and North Korea, with China and India
abstaining. The isolation of Putin's Russia is linked to the country's
inability to articulate an attractive message about what it stands for
beyond being the self-proclaimed antipode to the United
States.]{.underline} At least during the Cold War, the Soviet Union was
the bearer of a powerful ideology that found adherents around the world.
During his two decades in power, Putin has squandered the possibilities
of Russian soft power. With a tiny fraction of Russia's oil windfall, he
could have established a global network of institutes, like Germany's
Goethe-Institut or Spain's Instituto Cervantes, to tap into widespread
interest in Russian culture. Instead he focused on Russian hard power,
turning the Soviet Union's victory in World War II into the regime's
ideological foundation. The untold human sacrifice in World War II was
the source of the Soviet Union's legitimacy as a UN Security Council
member and worthy rival to the United States. [With his unprovoked war
against Ukraine, Putin has surrendered the last piece of moral high
ground Russia, as the successor state of the Soviet Union, held as a
leading member of the coalition that defeated Hitler. Putin's savage
attack on Ukraine will taint and overshadow the memory of Russian
heroism in World War II for generations to come.]{.underline} In May
2005, leaders from more than fifty countries, including the United
States and Ukraine, attended the Victory Day celebrations marking the
sixtieth anniversary of Nazi Germany's defeat. The number of foreign
guests has since decreased inversely to Putin's mounting aggression.
Last year, only the leader of Tajikistan paid Putin the honor of
attending his parade. This May 9, in a striking symbol of Russia's
isolation, no foreign guests came at all.

"[Turkey is a NATO ally and will remain one. The war between our two
partners Russia and Ukraine has created a new understanding in favor of
strengthening procurement ties with our NATO allies," a presidential
aide told Defense News, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss
Ankara's diplomatic tightrope walk]{.underline}. The war has once again
put Turkey in a pivotal broker position within NATO. Ankara has
cultivated ties with both Russia and Ukraine that officials hope will
provide dividends in future negotiations. Turkey's approval is also
needed to advance Sweden's and Finland's respective NATO membership
applications, which grew out of their fear that Russia would work to
permanently isolate them from the alliance. But there is some history to
overcome. In 2020, Turkey paid \$2.5 billion for the Russian S-400 air
defense system. But fearing further isolation and sanctions from its
allies, Turkey decided against making the system operational. In
response to the acquisition, the U.S. suspended Turkey's membership in
the multinational consortium that builds the fifth-generation F-35
fighter jet. Turkey's down payment of \$1.5 billion for a first batch of
the stealth aircraft, which Ankara never received, remains to be
reimbursed. In March of this year, a senior Turkish diplomat who deals
with NATO and security affairs told Defense News that the
Russo-Ukrainian war has practically killed all potential Turkish-Russian
deals related to strategic weapon systems. [With Russia off the table as
a military supplier, Turkish leaders are back to surveying the Western
market]{.underline}. A senior Turkish procurement official said earlier
this spring that the Eurofighter Typhoon is one option, involving the
sale of about 80 aircraft --- a purchase that would give Turkish
industry an edge as it builds the country's indigenous fighter jet in
the making, the TF-X. The Typhoon was originally designed as an air
superiority fighter. It is manufactured by a consortium made up of
Airbus, BAE Systems and Leonardo, which conducts the majority of the
aircraft project through a joint holding company, Eurofighter
Jagdflugzeug GmbH. The NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency,
representing the U.K., Germany, Italy and Spain, manages the project and
is the prime customer. Turkey also has moved to acquire 40 F-16 Block 70
aircraft and upgrade kits for its 80 older F-16s. The Turkish request
went to Congress in April. Earlier in May, the Biden administration
asked the House of Representatives to approve the upgrade of Turkey's
F-16 fighter jet fleet. A potential deal may include high-tech missiles,
radar systems and electronic warfare suites for the planes. In addition,
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan expressed hope in March that the
trilateral talks between Turkey, France and Italy to co-produce the
European air and anti-missile defense system SAMP/T, built by Eurosam,
would resume after the French elections in April. In similar optimism,
Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said in late March that Italy and
France were thinking "more seriously" now on co-producing the SAMP/T
systems in Turkey. [Meanwhile, Britain took steps to ease Turkey's
return to the Western procurement system. Turkish Deputy Foreign
Minister Faruk Kaymakcı said in February that Britain had lifted a ban
on arms sales to Turkey, imposed after a unilateral Turkish offensive in
northern Syria in 2019. The ease in trade restrictions was kept secret
from the public, and some observers say Canada might follow
suit]{.underline}. But most Western restrictions remain in effect. For
instance, the Czech Republic, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain
and Sweden imposed full arms embargoes on Turkey since 2019 over its
military interventions in Syria. France has placed restrictions on an
array of defense and aviation subsystems, and Italy has barred the sale
of certain products. Germany has suspended plans to sell engines to
power the Altay, Turkey's first indigenous main battle tank in the
making. "[Turkey's careful balancing act between its NATO allies and
Russia has generally been recognized in the West, sometimes with much
praise. How Turkey will maneuver between clashing Western and Russian
interests in the near future will shape Western appetite for Turkey's
return to their procurement system]{.underline}," said Ozgur Eksi, a
defense analyst in Ankara. Some Western diplomats think Erdoğan may try
to use Turkey's veto power in NATO for a reset in procurement ties with
the West. He said May 13 that his country is "not favorable" toward
Finland and Sweden joining the alliance, indicating Turkey could use its
membership to veto moves to admit the two countries. The issue was
unresolved at press time. "The Turks appear to be preparing for a tough
bargaining process, which may include the transfer of certain weapons
system," said a U.S. diplomat in Ankara. Russia's aggression in Ukraine
prompted Finland and Sweden to reconsider their traditions of military
nonalignment. Eksi said that because of the war in Ukraine, Turkey would
unlikely consider touching major arms deal with Russia that were
previously on the table. "That includes any Turkish intention to buy the
Russian-made Su-35 or Su-57 aircraft," he said. Erdoğan has previously
said Turkey was interested in buying the Russian-made fighter jets.

Of the many countries struggling to find a proper approach to the
Russia-Ukraine war, Turkey seems to have landed on the most
controversial yet comfortable one. [Ankara has managed to preserve its
relationship with both Moscow and Kyiv without endangering its own
geostrategic calculations in the region while at the same time avoiding
joining ranks with Western countries in imposing crippling sanctions on
Russia. The role of a key mediator, which President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan
was so eager to take on, has allowed Turkey to conveniently position
itself in the middle of the fight---and not just in the conflict between
Russia and Ukraine but more broadly in the struggle between Russia and
the West, and even globally between the West and the numerous
non-Western countries that have preferred to strike a more cautious and
balanced approach to the war.]{.underline} The overall political and
ideological polarization incited by the war in Ukraine has threatened
many countries that have worked for years to build a balanced,
pragmatic, multivector foreign policy. Now many of them find themselves
having to make a hard choice. Western countries under U.S. guidance are
urging them to make common cause against Russia, which often means
abandoning their balancing act between major powers. As the war has
shown, in a highly tense international environment, a posture of
neutrality and balancing on the part of countries struggling not to
choose sides is not welcome by the conflicting parties, which strive to
mobilize support for their own efforts. [Turkey in particular has had to
carve a path that does not lethally threaten relations with either
Russia or the EU.]{.underline} The war in Ukraine has presented Ankara
with both opportunities and risks. After the 2015 centralization of
political power in the hands of Recep Erdoğan, the president moved his
personal ambitions and goals to the forefront of Turkey's foreign
policy. In particular, he has sought to make Turkey a regional Muslim
superpower capable of designing and guiding a new "post-Western"
security architecture in greater Eurasia and one of the first
non-Western powers to shape the new multipolar world order. [To preserve
this course, Turkey has had to find an appropriate way to deal with the
Ukraine challenge. In essence, two global objectives became a priority
for Turkey when Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24: to preserve its
global and regional positions, which Turkey has managed to consolidate
and enhance after 2016; as well as to reinforce Ankara's influence and
amplify earlier achievements to ensure further expansion.]{.underline}
Objective 1: Preserving Turkey's Global and Regional Positions The first
global objective is reflected in several developments that became
essential in Ankara's quest to hold its ground. First, the war in
Ukraine has threatened Turkey's pragmatic multipolar approach
underpinning its foreign policy. The political coalescence of NATO and
EU countries against Russia could not have escaped Turkey's attention.
Nor could Ankara remain on the sidelines and refrain from getting
involved, given its close ties with several Western countries and its
NATO commitments. On the other hand, Turkey did not want to degrade its
relations with Russia by joining the Western-led sanctions, in which
Ankara has declined to participate since 2014. For Turkey, Russia has
been an important trading partner (\$32.5 billion as of 2021), a key
source of foreign investment (more than \$10 billion), a colossal source
of tourists (Russians account for almost 5 million visits, or 1 percent
of all foreign tourist visitation), a crucial energy supplier, and an
important "frenemy" in several regional playgrounds where Turkey (though
not without Russia) has been able to actually accomplish something, such
as in Syria, Libya, and Nagorno-Karabakh. [Turkey has been able to
maintain relations with Russia and the West, thereby sustaining its
desired global position, by assuming the role of a key mediator between
Russia and Ukraine. This formal role gives Ankara a good reason not to
get involved in sanctioning Moscow.]{.underline} Second, the war in
Ukraine, with its subsequent social, economic, political, and
transnational repercussions, has endangered stability on a number of
regional issues that are vital for Turkey's security, reputation, and
international self-reliance. For years, Turkey's regional policy was
built on a situational partnership with Moscow. The possible weakening
of Russia as a result of the war in Ukraine could throw the regional
balance in the South Caucasus, the Black Sea region, and the Levant into
disarray, strengthening, for instance, Iran in Syria---and Iran is one
of Turkey's less preferred competitors. Regional destabilization is not
in Ankara's interests, especially in light of the substantial financial
and economic difficulties Turkey has been struggling with since last
autumn. Objective 2: Reinforcing Ankara's Influence The second global
objective has to do with furthering Turkey's political, economic, trade,
and geopolitical expansion. By shaping the dynamics of the current
crisis, Turkey is trying to "ride the tide" and use it to its advantage.
Its tactics to achieve this goal include taking the place of Western
companies on the Russian market, accruing tourist and financial flows
from Russia, thereby bypassing sanctions, and gaining political ground
in regional affairs by taking on a mediation role, forcing the
conflicting parties to consult with and through Ankara on issues of war,
peace, maritime trade, the demining of the Black Sea, and the
restoration of essential Ukrainian wheat exports. In addition, many
Russians, fearing Western sanctions, have moved to Turkey, investing
millions in the local real estate market and registering businesses
there, which is also a lucrative deal for Ankara. (Ankara offers
citizenship for a \$400,000 investment.) Finally, Turkey sees an
opportunity to achieve its long-sought goal of becoming the major gas
transit hub for Europe. With the European allies determined more than
ever to reduce their dependence on Russian gas imports, Turkey is
offering its services and lobbying for realization of a long-discussed
new subsea pipeline between Israel and Turkey, one that would allow
eastern Mediterranean gas to reach Europe through Turkey. Even more
important for Ankara in this context is exploiting the momentum to
strengthen its own standing in the world. As Western partners search for
support in containing the Russian threat and dealing with an array of
war-related consequences, Ankara sees the time is ripe to make the West
drop sanctions against the Turkish defense industry and embrace Turkey
as an equal partner. It is with this logic in mind that Turkey's
leadership unexpectedly jumped on NATO's expansion process with bold
demands as to what Sweden, Finland, and NATO member states should do to
obtain Ankara's consent. And it is this tactic of getting the most out
of concessions from all parties that drove Erdoğan to announce a new
military operation in northern Syria against the Western-backed Kurds,
thereby endangering the regional positions of both Russia and the United
States. All in all, Ankara's predominant stance on the Russia-Ukraine
war is not about Russia or Ukraine at all. It is about ensuring that any
future postwar settlement in the region and the world will necessarily
include Turkey's interests, and ideally establish Turkey as a
stakeholder in the process. Turkey's serious economic problems, however,
mean these plans may have to be adjusted. The key aspect of the
Russia-Ukraine war for Erdoğan and his government remains not so much
support for Ukraine or Russia as an opportunity for Erdoğan to
strengthen his position on the international stage at the expense of
either country's interests by proactively practicing diplomacy amid the
developing crisis.

### 1AR -- Link Turn

#### L/T--NATO and Turkey are [key]{.underline} to mitigating Middle Eastern conflict

**Cammack & Dunne 18**(Perry Cammack was a nonresident fellow in the
Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,
where he focuses on long-term regional trends and their implications for

SC)

In comparison with almost every other geographical region, [the Middle
East suffers from a lack of both regional dispute resolution mechanisms
and diplomatic protocols that might reduce the scope for regional
conflict]{.underline}. While the Cold War was defined by the antagonism
between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, both sides increasingly felt the need
for inclusive institutions and mechanisms to reduce tensions. Every U.S.
president during the Cold War, from Dwight D. Eisenhower to George H. W.
Bush, met with his Soviet counterpart. During the tensest moments,
high-level U.S.-Soviet channels of communications were especially
important. Over time, a number of confidence-building institutions and
transparency-enhancing measures were created, including the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), successive arms control
agreements, and later the Treaty on Open Skies, which allows for unarmed
surveillance flights over signatory countries to promote military and
nuclear weapons openness. In the Middle East, however, [the absence of
any similar mechanisms or organizations, particularly amid proliferating
military conflicts, feeds security dilemmas across multiple vectors, so
that steps justified by one state as necessary to its
security]{.underline}---military intervention, arms procurement,
alliance formation, and so on---are perceived by its rivals as
threatening. During the Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts of the 1990s,
there were attempts to build mechanisms for regional communication and
cooperation. Participants at the 1991 Madrid Conference set up five
multilateral working groups to address regional challenges, each
involving Israel and a range of Arab states. The centerpiece was the
Arms Control and Regional Security (ACRS) working group, which marked
the first bid to create a formal multilateral framework for regional
security issues. Six ACRS plenary sessions, co-hosted by the United
States and Russia, were held and a series of regional
confidence-building measures were outlined before the working group
slowly broke down by 1995 under the weight of regional animosities and
implementation challenges. While all of the working groups have long
been defunct, one tangible result survives: the Middle East Desalination
Research Center in Oman, created in 1995. The center conducts
transboundary water research and development projects, and its
membership includes Israel, Jordan, Oman, Palestine, and Qatar as well
as several Western nations.

[A second area where **Turkey's immediate security concerns intersect
with the majority of other NATO members** is stability in the Middle
East, most immediately in Syria]{.underline}. To be sure,
[Turkey's]{.underline} anger over United States' partnership with the
YPG in the fight against the Islamic State---[appnd NATO's]{.underline}
anger at Turkey for its unilateral incursion into northern Syria---will
make progress difficult. But ultimately, the two **[sides share a mutual
interest in seeing stability and pluralistic governance in
Syria.]{.underline}** This entails constraining Syrian president Bashar
al-Assad; preventing the return of the Islamic State and Europe-based
Islamic State fighters; and facilitating the delivery of humanitarian
aid, reconstruction, and refugee return. More broadly, [both sides also
share an interest in limiting Russian and Iranian influence in the
region.]{.underline} With the Russian military presence in Armenia,
Azerbaijan, and Crimea now supplemented by the Russian naval base at
Tartus, airbases at Kobani and Khmeimim, and helicopter base\[s\] at
Qamishli, Turkey is effectively encircled by Russia. It is in this
context that German minister of defence Kramp-Karrenbauer's suggestion
of [an internationally-controlled security zone along the Turkey-Syria
border, possibly NATO-led]{.underline} and backed by the United Nations
in loose partnership with Russia, makes sense. It [would address a
situation that immediately and directly affects the security of Europe
and Turkey and demonstrate that]{.underline} the **[NATO is invested in
addressing Turkey's security concerns]{.underline}**. Should NATO and
Turkey move to restore some level of trust by taking these first steps,
it will be important to avoid unnecessarily escalating tensions. For
Turkey, this means abiding by the terms of the Syria ceasefire, not
pursuing additional purchases of Russian military equipment, and doing
its part to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State in the region or
return of Islamic State foreign fighters to Europe. For the United
States and Europe, the trick will be to apply the required sanctions and
arms embargoes in a discriminate way. For example, whereas imposing
sanctions in accordance with the Countering America's Adversaries
Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) and withholding delivery of Turkey's
F-35s due to its purchase of the Russian S-400 makes good policy sense,
imposing additional blanket sanctions could do more harm than good,
affecting the Turkish people more than their leadership and giving
Erdogan another opportunity to blame the West for Turkey's economic
problems. A smarter approach might involve going after corrupt actors
using the Global Magnitsky Act. Similarly, a total arms embargo by the
United States and the European Union will only drive Turkey to procure
more Russian or non-NATO interoperable military equipment. Rather, the
arms embargoes should be limited along the lines of the most recent
House sanctions bill, which includes exemptions for items to be used in
NATO-approved operations. Finally, as some of Turkey's biggest export
partners, the European Union and the United States can provide needed
carrots along the way to incentivize constructive behavior by Ankara.
[Measures might include an eventual upgrade of Turkey's customs union
with the European Union or limited visa-free travel to EU countries for
Turkish citizens.]{.underline} For the United States, President Trump's
offer of a \$100 billion trade deal will also be attractive to Erdogan
in Turkey's struggling economy. To be sure, repairing the trust that has
been lost and returning Turkey to the path of Western integration will
be a struggle, requiring sustained effort, and a setting aside of egos,
on all sides. Yet on this occasion of NATO's 70th anniversary, Turkey
and its NATO allies owe it to one another to pause for a moment and
reflect not on their many disagreements but on what brought them
together in the first instance and why that still matters.

**[human trials]{.underline}** [of his brain-computer
interface]{.underline} technology. A new job posting for a 'Clinical
Trial Director' at Neuralink reveals that the neurotech startup is
preparing to take its brain chip research to the next stage.
[Neuralink]{.underline} has already [conducted **trials on pigs and
monkeys**]{.underline}, including a successful experiment involving a
nine-year-old macaque capable of playing video games using only its
mind. The firm eventually hopes to use the technology to allow "human-AI

month will take place **[in 2022]{.underline}**, [will]{.underline}
likely [involve people with paralysis using Neuralink's]{.underline}
[interface]{.underline} to gain direct neural control of a computer
cursor. The position calls for candidates who are "mission-driven" and
"willing and eager to go above and beyond" to achieve the company's
ambitions. "As the Clinical Trial Director, you'll work closely with
some of the most innovative doctors and top engineers, as well as
working with Neuralink's first Clinical Trial participants!" the job
listing, first spotted by Bloomberg, states. "You will lead and help
build the team responsible for enabling Neuralink's clinical research
activities and developing the regulatory interactions that come with a
fast-paced and ever-evolving environment." In return, Neuralink claims
to offer "an opportunity to change the world and work with some of the
smartest and the most talented experts from different fields". The
Neuralink device is the size of a coin and can be implanted into the
skull The first practical applications of Neuralink's technology will
involve treating people with brain disorders and diseases, according to
Mr Musk, who says it will "solve important brain and spine problems with
a seamlessly implanted device." The tech billionaire, who also heads
SpaceX and Tesla, claims that the potential for Neuralink's brain chip
beyond that is almost limitless. "You could solve blindness, you could
solve paralysis, you could solve hearing," he said during a company
presentation in 2020. "In the future, you'll be able to save and replay
memories. This is increasingly sounding like a Black Mirror episode\...
Ultimately you could download them into a new body or a robot body." He
has since claimed that the technology will give people "enhanced
abilities", like being able to stream music directly to their brain.
Neuralink's monkey was able to move the virtual paddle of Pong just by
thinking about it A 2019 paper written by Neuralink researchers
described a brain-computer interface that used an array of "small and
flexible electrode 'threads'", that are surgically implanted into the
brain by a robot. The device itself is "about the size of a coin" and
can apparently replace a piece of the skull without causing any lasting
damage to the brain. Future versions would feature an all-day battery
life and would be able to connect wirelessly to a wearer's smartphone.

Research could lead to breakthroughs in the emerging field of
brain-computer interfaces A new array of brain sensors can record
electrical signals directly from the surface of the human brain
Researchers have built a sensor capable of recording signals from the
human brain in record-breaking detail, opening up new possibilities for
brain-computer interfaces. A team of engineers and surgeons, led by
University of California San Diego professor Shadi Dayeh, used a densely
packed grid embedded with thousands of electrocorticography (EC0G)
sensors to allow them to read activity from the brain's cortex in 100
times higher resolution than existing technologies. The thin and
flexible array, measuring three-centimetres-by-three-centimetres, offers
a highly detailed perspective on specific parts of the brain, which
could have profound implications if approved for clinical use. Early
applications could include surgeons receiving ultra clear brain signal
information, providing better guidance for removing tumours without
damaging healthy tissue, as well as surgically treating drug-resistant
epilepsy. Longer-term, the brain device could be used as a permanent
wireless implant to assist people living with paralysis or other
neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's, which can be treated with
electrical stimulation. Beyond that, the ECoG technology could be
developed for use in the emerging field of brain-computer interfaces,
which have a huge range of potential applications -- from controlling a
computer just by thinking, to streaming music directly to your brain. By
uncovering new knowledge about how the brain works, for example, the
device could be used to interpret hand motions in new ways utilising
brain wave patterns. One of the most high-profile companies working on
brain-computer interface technology is Elon Musk's Neuralink startup,
which aims to commence human trials of its chip later this year.
Professor [Dayeh's team]{.underline} has **[already tested the ECoG
device on 19 people]{.underline}**, who agreed to be part of the
research [during the "downtime" of their]{.underline} already scheduled
[brain surgeries]{.underline}. The next step is to conduct [a
clinical]{.underline} trial of the technology, which [will be funded by
a \$12.25 million grant]{.underline} awarded to the scientists.

Values: Those with this perspective [believe in the primacy of
individual choice, mediated through the economic marketplace.
Responsibility and accountability are primarily vested in the
individual, not in the government.]{.underline} [Research and innovation
are viewed as powerful forces for human good]{.underline} because they
are expressions of individual creativity, and because they expand the
realm of choice available to individuals. [The marketplace is also seen
as a powerful catalyst for innovation that]{.underline}, when combined
with the potential of human enhancement technologies, [could lead to the
radical diversification of humanity---and consequent increase in freedom
of choice and expression. Economic competition combined with cognitive
enhancement competition should **push human performance and capabilities
to new heights**. Economies of scale]{.underline}, and trickle-down of
economic benefits, [will help to ensure that benefits are not
unacceptably concentrated among small groups.]{.underline} Transparency,
in the form of easily available information about cognitive enhancement,
will facilitate the efficiency and equity-serving behavior of the
market. Policies: [Needless to say, appropriate policies for advancing
this perspective should enable innovation and choice.]{.underline} One
place where [national government can play a positive role in is ensuring
a level playing field for market competition]{.underline}, for example
by monitoring the activities of other governments for inappropriate
subsidies, and by ensuring that policy tools such as intellectual
property (IP) are not used in the private sector as a way of blocking
innovation. [Governments may also need to protect the level playing
field for consumers]{.underline}, so that the already-enhanced do not
act, through non-market means, to protect their status by preventing
others from becoming enhanced. The government should also create a
clearinghouse on product information (including testing and consumer
complaints) so that consumers can understand what is known about
efficacy, risks, and benefits of particular technologies. [Companies, in
turn, should be shielded from liability if they withdraw products from
the market after problems have been uncovered. Regulation of particular
technologies is not out of the question, **but only if evidence of harm
to humans or the environment becomes clear.**]{.underline} Some areas of
tension exist within this policy framework. In particular, laissez-faire
advocates may differ on how active the role of government ought to be in
funding research, in helping to ensure the safety of new technologies,
and in providing information to help consumers make wise choices.
Interventions such as IP protection, liability limits, and regulation of
childhood applications of cognitive enhancement also raise dilemmas
about appropriate government action.

growing rapidly, with many actors, large and small, having complicated
ties to each other, to governments, and to academia.While information
flows freely online, the trend toward open science makes it mandatory
for scientists to deposit more and more data,21,22such as genome
sequences in open archives, free for any bad actors to grab.[Setting up
new tech]{.underline}nology [platforms is becoming less
expensive]{.underline} every year, primarily [because the costs of
ge-nomes equencing, DNAsynthesis, dataanalysis,and datastorage are going
down]{.underline}. The [capacity to create now lethalstrains of
pathogens are currently available at most majoruniversities]{.underline}
around the world.More and more sophisticated delivery systems
increasethe possibilities for covert action. New possibilitieswithin the
fields of nanotechnology and small auton-omous vehicles may broaden the
repertoire of vectorsbeyond what is available today.23,[24The community
of **bad actors** is increasing in com-plexity and is no longer limited
to **rogue nation states**but also includes private security
contractors, criminalgroups,]{.underline} **[and terrorist
groups]{.underline}**, all of which may act inconcert or in
parallel.That accountability and [attribution]{.underline} can be [made
difficultby shifting bioweapons production from the government tothe
private sector]{.underline} is well illustrated by the South
Africanapartheid-era Project Coast, where several private compa-nies
were used as cover for the production of biological andchemical
agents.25[Today's global economy]{.underline}, where inter-national
biotech companies are becoming increasingly connected with large
academic research institutions andwith government agencies, [provides
near-perfect conditions for actors who want to hide biological
weapons]{.underline} develop-ment under the cover of innocent-looking
(dual-use) bio-medical research.10Notably, [one may have to
anticipatethat future antagonists may be a blend of states and non-state
actors using biological threats]{.underline} to pursue agendas thatmay
not even be political---similar to developments in thefield of
cybersecurity where bad actors are often nongov-ernmental and work for
profit.Future Biodefense Requires IncreasedCivil--Military SynergyHow
should democratic societies best prepare for the bleakfuture outlined in
this paper? Further work to improvecompliance to the Biological Weapons
Convention bybetter mechanisms for regulation of dual-use technologyis
laudable.26However, societies must look beyond tra-ditional means of
biodefense such as biosurveillance andstockpiling vaccines, drugs, and
personal protective equip-ment. [In a future where sophisticated biology
will becombined with information warfare]{.underline}, medical
**[intelligencewill be critical]{.underline}**27because (1)
high-resolution and updatedassessment of the biotechnological capacity
among antag-onists will be vital to deny attackers the element of
surpriseand (2) we will need frontline research expertise and
in-frastructure to produce solid data to counter disinforma-tion.
Finally, large-scale datasets on pathogens, such as theirgenome
sequences, will prove vital for rapid production ofcountermeasures.As a
civilian health professional, I suggest that [an up-dated biosecurity
strategy for democratic societies shouldinclude]{.underline} at
least:[Information countermeasures]{.underline} that can defend
againstdamaging narratives appearing alongside a biological attack.
Considering the inevitable polarity between free-dom of speech and
information campaigns, public mes-saging must be carefully performed,
preferably leaningheavily on well-validated and updated medical
data.[Rapid deployment of next-generation sequencingtechnologies to
genetically characterize emerging threatsand facilitate
attribution]{.underline}.28This requires scalable lo-gistics for rapid
and extensive sampling of the popu-lation, where field investigation
teams are linked withfirst-class molecular biology facilities.Rapid
postmortem investigations of deaths from sus-pected new biological
threats. The purpose of this isnot only to sample potential pathogens,
but also tocharacterize how new agents injure and kill---knowledgethat
is critical for treating victims that are still alive.29Secure data
transmission and storage, and computa-tional capacity that can rapidly
be scaled up to analyzevast amounts of biological data. This should
include arapid and secure system to funnel data to producers ofvaccines
and other countermeasures.A closer collaboration among government, the
defensesector, healthcare providers, the commercial biotechsector, and
medical research institutions[. It would beadvantageous to draft plans
and financial contracts thatregulate this collaboration in
**peacetime**, to be activatedlater in times of crisis]{.underline}. In
the recent launch of the Eu-ropean Health Emergency Preparedness and
ResponseAuthority,
thecivil--militaryaxisinsuchcollaborationsisstrikingly absent, at least
according to open sources.30A constantly updated pool of expert
scientists andhealthcare professionals that can be pulled into
servicewhen required. This indicates [the need for]{.underline}
security-cleared civilian [experts who are regularly trained tomobilize
in times of crisis]{.underline}---essentially a core of aca-demic
reservists.Finally, a word of warning: [when entering a new era
ofincreased preparedness, it is essential to maintain a
**balancedapproach**]{.underline}. A hypervigilance among government
agencies to-ward biological threats can be a vulnerability in itself,
carryingthe risk that small natural outbreaks of benign pathogens
willtrigger massive lockdowns, which hamper other elements ofdefense,
prove financially costly, and risk attenuating the re-sponse once a real
threat emerges. Finding out fast and withhigh precision what exactly
caused a set of suspicious deaths ora disease outbreak before it becomes
clickbait and fuels hys-teria will be critical. Ramping up medical
intelligence effortsto include frontline methods and top expertise in
molecularbiology is thus of paramount importance.

### 2AC -- Cognitive Biotech Good

#### Theories that suggest augmentation has [negative]{.underline} psychological effects are [unfounded]{.underline}.

enhancement ethics, superintelligence risks, and the reversal test;

RL\]

For example, [many commentators worry]{.underline} about the
[**psychological effects** of the use of germ-line
engineering]{.underline}. The ability to select one's children's genes
and create "designer babies" will, it is claimed, corrupt parents, who
will come to view their children as mere products (Kass 2001). We will
then begin to evaluate our offspring according to standards of quality
control, and this will undermine the ethical ideal of unconditional
acceptance of children, no matter what their abilities and traits. Are
we really prepared, asks the objector, to sacrifice on the altar of
consumerism even those deep values that are embodied in traditional
relationships between child and parents? Is the quest for "perfection"
worth this cultural and moral cost? Faced with such criticism, how
should a transhumanist respond? Certainly not by dismissing the concerns
as irrelevant. [Transhumanists no less than other people recognize that
the **depicted outcome** would be bad. We don't want parents to **love**
and **respect** their children less. We don't want social
prejudice]{.underline} against people with disabilities [to get worse.
The psychological and cultural effects of "commodifying" human nature
are]{.underline} potentially [important]{.underline}. The first thing to
emphasize, however, is that [these dystopian scenarios are
**speculations**.]{.underline} There is, at least to my knowledge[, no
solid ground for believing]{.underline} that these [alleged consequences
would actually happen. What relevant evidence we have]{.underline}, for
instance [regarding]{.underline} the [treatment of children who have
been conceived through]{.underline} the use of [in vitro fertilization
or embryo screening, suggests]{.underline} that the [pessimistic
prognosis is both **alarmist** and **wrong**. Parent will in fact
**love** and **respect** their children even when artificial means and
conscious choice play a part in procreation]{.underline}.

#### Even if there are negative effects of cognitive enhancement, the benefits outweigh. 

**Bostrom '05** \[Nick; philosopher at the University of Oxford known

There will in all likelihood be some negative consequences of human
germ-line engineering that we cannot or will not forestall. Needless to
say, [the mere existence of negative effects is **no reason** not to
proceed]{.underline}. Any [major technology]{.underline} (as well as any
major social or political reform) [has]{.underline} some [negative
consequences, including]{.underline} some [unforeseen negative
consequences]{.underline}. And so does, for that matter, the choice to
preserve status quo. [It is only after]{.underline} a [**fair
comparison** of]{.underline} the [risks with]{.underline} the [likely
positive consequences that any conclusion based on]{.underline} a
[c]{.underline}ost-[b]{.underline}enefit [a]{.underline}nalysis can be
[reached]{.underline}. In the case of germ-line enhancements, the
[**potential gains** are enormous]{.underline}. Only rarely, however,
are these potential gains elaborated on at any length, perhaps because
they are too obvious to be of much theoretical interest. (By contrast,
uncovering subtle and non-trivial ways in which manipulating our genome
could undermine deep values is philosophically a lot more challenging.)
But if we think about it, we recognize that [the promise of genetic
enhancements is **anything but insignificant**]{.underline}. Set aside,
for a moment, any worries you might have about possible downsides.
Surely, [being free from **severe** 18 **genetic diseases**
is]{.underline} a [really good]{.underline} thing. And [having a mind
that can learn more quickly, or having a robust immune system, is
wonderful]{.underline} too. A [healthier]{.underline}, wittier, [happier
humanity]{.underline} may be able to [reach new levels culturally as
well as in terms of individual lives. To achieve a **significant
enhancement** of human capacities would]{.underline} be to [take a
**step** on]{.underline} the [**transhuman journey** to
explore]{.underline} some of those [modes of being]{.underline} that are
[not accessible to humans]{.underline} as [currently]{.underline}
constituted, [and perchance to discover]{.underline} and realize
[**important new** values]{.underline}. On an even more basic level,
[there is a great potential for **alleviating** unnecessary **human
suffering**. Every day that the introduction of effective human genetic
enhancement is delayed]{.underline} [is a day of **lost individual** and
**cultural potential**]{.underline}, and [a day of **torment** for
**millions**]{.underline} of sufferers who are [**being ravaged** by
**diseases** that could have been prevented.]{.underline}

#### Cognitive biotech is [inevitable]{.underline} -- it only has a risk of [healing]{.underline} people.

But [thanks to]{.underline} recent [scientific developments
in]{.underline} areas such as [biotechnology]{.underline}, information
technology and nanotechnology, [humanity may be on the **cusp** of an
**enhancement revolution**]{.underline}. In the next two or three
decades, [people]{.underline} may [have the option to change themselves
and]{.underline} their [children]{.underline} in ways
[that]{.underline}, up to now, have existed [largely in]{.underline} the
minds of [science fiction]{.underline} writers and creators of comic
book superheroes.

Both [advocates for]{.underline} and opponents of human [enhancement
spin]{.underline} a [number of possible scenarios. Some talk
about]{.underline} what might be called "humanity plus" --
[people]{.underline} who are [still recognizably human, but]{.underline}
much [smarter, stronger and healthier]{.underline}. Others speak of
"post-humanity," and predict that dramatic advances in genetic
engineering and machine technology may ultimately allow people to become
conscious machines -- not recognizably human, at least on the outside.

This [enhancement revolution]{.underline}, if and when it comes,
[may]{.underline} well [be prompted by ongoing efforts to **aid people**
with disabilities and heal the sick]{.underline}. Indeed,
[science]{.underline} is [already making **rapid progress** in new
restorative and therapeutic technologies that could]{.underline}, in
theory, [have implications for human enhancement]{.underline}.

It seems that each week or so, [the headlines herald]{.underline} a [new
**medical** or **scientific** breakthrough]{.underline}. In the last few
years, for instance, [researchers have implanted **artificial retinas**
to give]{.underline} blind [patients partial **sight**]{.underline}.
Other [scientists successfully linked]{.underline} a [paralyzed man's
brain to a **computer chip**]{.underline}, which [helped
**restore**]{.underline} partial [**movement** of]{.underline}
previously [non-responsive limbs]{.underline}. Still
[others]{.underline} have [created **synthetic blood substitutes**,
which could]{.underline} soon [be used in human patients]{.underline}.

One of the most important developments in recent years involves a new
gene-splicing technique called "clustered regularly interspaced short
palindromic repeats." Known by its acronym, [CRISPR]{.underline}, this
new method [greatly **improves** scientists' ability to accurately and
efficiently "edit" the human genome, in both embryos and
adults]{.underline}.

[To]{.underline} those who support human enhancement, many of whom call
themselves [transhumanists, technological breakthroughs like these are
**springboards** not only to **healing people** but to changing and
improving humanity]{.underline}. Up to this point, they say, humans have
largely worked to control and shape their exterior environments because
they were powerless to do more. But transhumanists predict that [a
convergence of new technologies will soon allow people to control and
fundamentally change their bodies and minds. Instead of
leaving]{.underline} a person's [physical well-being to]{.underline} the
vagaries of [nature, supporters]{.underline} of these technologies
[contend, science will allow us to take control of our species'
development, making ourselves]{.underline} and future generations
[stronger, smarter, healthier and happier.]{.underline}

On Feb. 25, 2014, President Barack Obama met with Army officials and
engineers at the Pentagon to discuss plans to create a new super armor
that would make soldiers much more dangerous and harder to kill. The
president joked that "we're building 'Iron Man,'" but Obama's jest
contained more than a kernel of truth: The exoskeleton, called [the
Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (**TALOS**), does look vaguely like
the fictional Tony Stark's famous Iron Man suit]{.underline}. The first
prototypes already are being built, and if all goes as planned,
[American soldiers may soon be **much** **stronger** and largely
**impervious** to bullets]{.underline}.

A little more than a year later and an ocean away, [**scientists** with
the United Kingdom's National Health Service]{.underline} (NHS)
[announced]{.underline} that by 2017, [they plan to]{.underline} begin
[giv]{.underline}ing [human subjects **synthetic** or **artificial
blood**. If]{.underline} the [NHS moves ahead]{.underline} with its
plans, [it would be the first time people receive **blood** **created**
in a lab]{.underline}. While [the]{.underline} ultimate [aim of the
effort is to stem blood shortages]{.underline}, especially for rare
blood types, the [success of synthetic blood]{.underline} could
[lay]{.underline} the [foundation for a blood substitute that could be
**engineered** to **carry more oxygen** or **better fight
infections**.]{.underline}

In April 2016, [scientists from]{.underline} the Battelle Memorial
Institute in [Columbus]{.underline}, Ohio, [revealed]{.underline} that
[they had implanted a chip in the brain of a quadriplegic
man]{.underline}. The [chip can send signals to a sleeve around the
man's arm, allowing him to pick up]{.underline} a [glass of
water]{.underline}, [swipe]{.underline} a [credit card and]{.underline}
even [play]{.underline} the video game [Guitar Hero]{.underline}.

Roughly around the same time, [Chinese **researchers** announced they
had attempted to **genetically alter** 213 embryos to make them HIV
resistant.]{.underline} Only four of the embryos were successfully
changed and all were ultimately destroyed. Moreover, the scientists from
the Guangzhou Medical University who did the work said its purpose was
solely to test the feasibility of embryo gene editing, rather than to
regularly begin altering embryos. Still, Robert Sparrow of Australia's
Monash University Centre for Human Bioethics said that while [editing
embryos to prevent HIV]{.underline} has an obvious therapeutic purpose,
the experiment more broadly would lead to other things. "Its most
[plausible use]{.underline}, and most likely use, [is the **technology**
of **human enhancement**]{.underline}," he said, according to the South
China Morning Post.

As these examples show, [many]{.underline} of the [fantastic
technologies]{.underline} that until recently [were confined to science
fiction]{.underline} have already [arrived]{.underline}, at least in
their early forms. "We are no longer living in a time when we can say we
either want to enhance or we don't," says Nicholas Agar, a professor of
ethics at Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, and author of
the book "Humanity's End: Why We Should Reject Radical Enhancement."
"[We are **already living** in an age of **enhancement**]{.underline}."

The [road to **TALOS**, **brain chips** and **synthetic
blood**]{.underline} has been a [long]{.underline} one that has
[included many stops along the way]{.underline}. Many of these [advances
come from]{.underline} a [convergence of more than one type of
**technology** -- from genetics and robotics to nanotechnology and
information technology. These technologies are
"**intermingling**]{.underline} and feeding on one another,
[and]{.underline} they [are **collectively creating** a **curve** of
**change** unlike anything]{.underline} we [**humans** have ever
seen]{.underline}," journalist Joel Garreau writes in his book "Radical
Evolution: The Promise and Peril of Enhancing Our Minds, Our Bodies --
and What It Means to Be Human."

The [combination of information technology and nanotechnology offers the
prospect of machines that are]{.underline}, to quote the title of Robert
Bryce's recent book on innovation, "[Smaller Faster Lighter Denser
Cheaper]{.underline}." And as some futurists such as Ray Kurzweil argue,
these developments will occur at an accelerated rate as technologies
build on each other. "An analysis of the history of technology shows
that [technological change is **exponential**]{.underline}, contrary to
the common-sense 'intuitive linear' view," writes Kurzweil, an American
computer scientist and inventor whose work has led to the development of
everything from checkout scanners at supermarkets to text-reading
machines for the blind. "So we won't experience 100 years of progress in
the 21st century -- [it will be more like **20,000 years of progress**
(at today's rate]{.underline})."

#### Genetic engineering has a [wealth]{.underline} of possibilities to [improve]{.underline} net [health]{.underline} and [eliminate maladies]{.underline}.

[In]{.underline} the field of [biotech]{.underline}nology, a big
[milestone occurred]{.underline} in 1953, [when]{.underline} American
biologist James [Watson and British physicist Francis Crick discovered
the **molecular structure** of DNA -- the famed double helix -- that is
the genetic blueprint]{.underline} for life. Almost 50 years later, in
2003, [two international teams of researchers led by American biologists
Francis Collins and Craig Venter succeeded in decoding and reading that
blueprint by identifying all of the chemical base pairs that make up
human DNA]{.underline}.

[Finding]{.underline} the [blueprint for life, and successfully
decoding]{.underline} and reading [it]{.underline}, has [given
researchers]{.underline} an [opportunity to alter human
physiology]{.underline} at its most fundamental level. Manipulating this
genetic code -- a process known as [genetic engineering]{.underline} --
[could allow scientists to produce people with stronger muscles, harder
bones and faster brains.]{.underline} Theoretically, it also could
create people with gills or webbed hands and feet or even wings -- and,
as Garreau points out in his book, could lead to "an even greater
variety of breeds of humans than there is of dogs."

In recent years, [the prospect of **advanced genetic engineering** has
become much more real, largely due to]{.underline} two developments.
First, [**inexpensive** and **sophisticated** gene mapping
technology]{.underline} has given scientists an increasingly more
sophisticated understanding of the human genome.

The [second]{.underline} important [development involves]{.underline}
the powerful new gene editing technology known as [CRISPR]{.underline}.
While gene editing itself is not new, CRISPR offers scientists a method
that is much faster, cheaper and more accurate. "It's about 1,000 times
cheaper \[than existing methods\]," says George Church, a geneticist at
Harvard Medical School. "It could be a game changer." [CRISPR is so much
more **efficient** and **accurate** than older gene-editing technology
because it uses each cell's immune system to target and splice out parts
of its DNA and replace them with new genetic code.]{.underline}

[CRISPR]{.underline} is already [dramatically expanding]{.underline} the
realm of what is possible in the field of genetic engineering. Indeed,
on June 21, 2016, the U.S. government announced that it had approved the
[first human trials]{.underline} using CRISPR, in this case [to
**strengthen** the **cancer-fighting properties** of the immune systems
of patients **suffering** from **melanoma** and other **deadly
cancers**]{.underline}. "CRISPR's power and versatility have opened up
new and wide-ranging possibilities across biology and medicine," says
Jennifer Doudna, a researcher at the University of California at
Berkeley and a co-inventor of CRISPR.

According to Doudna and others, [CRISPR could provide **new treatments**
or even **cures** to some of today's most feared diseases -- not only
**cancer**, but **Alzheimer's disease**, **Parkinson's disease** and
others]{.underline}.

CRISPR's power and versatility has opened up new and wide-ranging
possibilities across biology and medicine.

An even more intriguing possibility involves making genetic changes at
the embryonic stage, also known as germline editing. The logic is
simple: alter the gene lines in an embryo's eight or 16 cell stage (to,
say, eliminate the gene for Tay-Sachs disease) and that change will
occur in each of the resulting person's trillions of cells -- not to
mention in the cells of their descendants. [When combined with
researchers' **growing understanding** of the genetic links to various
diseases, CRISPR could conceivably help eliminate a **host of maladies**
in people **before they are born**.]{.underline}

In his book Our Posthuman Future, Fukuyama expresses [two main
worries]{.underline} about the transhumanist goal. First, [if we ever
succeed in creating beings with far greater abilities]{.underline} than
ourselves---[through biotech]{.underline}nology or
[genetics]{.underline} or [neuroscience or
whatever]{.underline}---[political equality will be
jeopardized]{.underline}. By tinkering with our essential human nature,
the universal essence of humanity will have been changed, and with it
the rational basis for thinking of all persons as equal in the political
system. Second, the [intricate human being created through millions of
years of evolutionary selection is]{.underline} carefully [balanced
between]{.underline}, for example, [violence for self-defense and
affection for social cohesion]{.underline}, and deliberate interventions
are unlikely to achieve creatures with just the right blend of good and
bad qualities. Nor can we necessarily discern what those qualities are,
as they have to prove themselves in the complexities of social life with
its countless variables[. I find myself squarely in the middle. I'm not
as sanguine about a hyperenhanced future as the transhumanists, nor am I
comfortable with their utopianism]{.underline}. As David Hume wisely
observed, the future tends to resemble the past. We can expect a range
of consequences as we incorporate new technologies and instrumentalities
into our lives and bodies. I also have doubts about the metaphysics of
the idea that the subjective experience of Building Better Soldiers •
159 personal identity can ever be captured, even by the most
comprehensive memory chip. [But neoconservatives such as Fukuyama seem
to me to harbor an excessively dour view of the
tech]{.underline}nological [future]{.underline}. First, [I'm not as
convinced as he is that the idea of human equality is grounded in a
universal concept of essential human nature; my more pragmatic view has
it that human equality is a rather squishy moral notion]{.underline}. It
feels right to most of us, and we rally around when we need to. Second,
[there is plenty of room for argument about his view that human
evolution has produced a mix of good and bad qualities that can't be
improved upon]{.underline}. Still more fundamentally, [I can't swallow
the suggestion that, in a world of ethnic and religious tension, nuclear
prolif]{.underline}eration, global [warming]{.underline}, emerging
[infections]{.underline}, [and terror]{.underline}ism, [transhumanism is
our biggest problem]{.underline}. Where [I do]{.underline} emphatically
[agree with Fukuyama is that the proper response to transhumanism is not
to prohibit r]{.underline}esearch [and d]{.underline}evelopment of these
new technologies [but to develop careful monitoring and **regulatory**
systems]{.underline}. Some of this can be accomplished by the scientific
community and its organizations. For example, in 2005 a committee that I
cochaired recommended guidelines on human embryonic stem cell research.
The committee was created by the National Academies, an organization of
elected members that is chartered by the federal government to advise it
on science, medicine, and engineering issues. Because the Bush
administration allowed research funding for only a few human embryonic
stem cell lines, scientists weren't sure what research would be
considered appropriate, especially since several states and private
companies intended to do work involving this controversial field. Among
many other recommendations, our committee concluded that no human
embryonic stem cells should be placed into nonhuman primates at any
stage of development. Part of the concern is that some of the human
cells might turn into brain cells in, say, a rhesus monkey embryo, and
they might contribute in an organized way to the monkey's brain.
Although we can't know if the monkey's brain would be changed by the
human cell contribution, we also can't be sure it wouldn't be. Would any
resulting creature feel like a human "locked" in a monkey's body? While
highly unlikely, this possibility arguably carries a serious ethical
burden. For similar reasons, we also recommended against putting
embryonic stem cells from other animals into human embryos. Given the
publicity and sensitivity of the embryonic stem cell issue and the
prestige of the National Academies, we felt sure our recommendations
would be adopted by legitimate research centers and individual
scientists. But that voluntary arrangement falls well short of
government regulation. Also, [with regulation there]{.underline} often
[comes significant government **funding** for research, which acts as an
important **incentive** to follow the rules]{.underline}. We have seen
how important government funding is in keeping a new area of medical
science on track in the case of in vitro fertilization. When the Reagan
administration decided to stop funding for IVF research in 1980, the
emerging industry was cut loose without public scrutiny. The result was
what many consider to be a field that bears a resemblance to the Wild
West, with all sorts of practices pursued and claims made and with only
limited public scrutiny and modest (and relatively recent)
self-regulation. [National security research on enhancement
tech]{.underline}nologies [will require]{.underline} the close
involvement of advisory bodies of people both in government and outside
it, with **[as much transparency as possible]{.underline}** and, when
transparency must be limited, with whatever security clearances are
needed to make full participation possible. [While]{.underline} some
[general principles should be articulated and become part of our
regulatory framework]{.underline}, much of [the hard work will have to
be done on a **case-by-case** basis]{.underline}. There are some models
out there for ethical review in security policy that I will talk about
in the last chapter. [The ethics of enhancing warfighters' capabilities
with **emerging neurotechnologies** needs to be moved onto our national
policy agenda]{.underline}. In addition to reactive regulatory
mechanisms, some thinkers propose proactive measures to mitigate the
potential harms of human enhancement. Julian Savulescu and Ingmar
Perrson, for example, argue that technological development has always
exacerbated the relative ease of causing harm relative to that of
benefit, and transhumanism is no exception. Technological development

improvement of morality is required to avert the destruction of
ourselves and the environment. Perhaps transhumanism could be turned
back on itself---that is to say, the augmentation of morality could
enhance the way we think about enhancement and progress in the first
place. But is the biotechnological enhancement of morality even
possible?

While [access to medicine]{.underline} is [currently]{.underline}
regarded as a [human right constrained by cost]{.underline} concerns, it
is less clear whether access to all enhancements should or would be
regarded as a positive right.6 The case for at least a negative right to
cognitive enhancement, based on cognitive liberty, privacy interests,
and the important interest of persons to protect and develop their own
minds and capacity for autonomy, seems very strong.7 [Banning
enhancements]{.underline} would [create an inducement for **black
markets** as well as limit **socially beneficial** uses. Legal
enhancement]{.underline} would [promote **development** and
**use**]{.underline}, in the long run [leading to **cheaper** and
**safer** enhancements]{.underline}. Yet [without public
funding,]{.underline} some useful [enhancements may be out of the reach
of many. Proponents of a positive right]{.underline} to enhancements
[could argue for]{.underline} their [position on grounds of fairness or
equality, or]{.underline} on grounds of a [**public interest** in the
**promotion** of the capacities required for autonomous
agency]{.underline}. The [**societal** benefits of effective cognitive
enhancement]{.underline} may even turn out to be so large and
unequivocal that [it would be]{.underline} Pareto [optimal to subsidize
enhancement]{.underline} for the poor just as the state now subsidizes
education.

### 2AC -- Markets/Military Biotech Good

#### Weaponization of biotechnical enhancements are occurring now -- from bio-integration of advanced tech to genetic modification of the body, [all]{.underline} levels of warfighting are being impacted -- encouraging commercial investments and sharing is the only way to maintain technical edge over adversaries which are [more likely]{.underline} to employ soldier modifications for violence

Rocks, 11/27/18,
https://warontherocks.com/2018/11/biotechnology-for-the-battlefield-in-need-of-a-strategy/

[Biotechnology]{.underline} --- a broad term used to describe
technological innovation based on biology --- [has become an
increasingly agile platform for developing new types of soldier
enhancements]{.underline}. As such, [the field offers novel
opportunities for improving warfighter survivability on the
battlefield]{.underline}. **[Despite recent developments, however, the
Department of Defense has yet to strategically guide the development of
these new technologies at the national level]{.underline}**. Recently,
[War on the Rocks published an article outlining concerns about the lack
of coordinated policy for developing synthetic biology]{.underline} -- a
branch of biotechnology -- [while preventing its misuse by
adversaries]{.underline}. The article rightly pointed to the need to
think strategically about the risk of proliferating synthetic biology
capabilities, but this is only one part of the picture. **[Current
national strategies encourage policymakers to view advances in biology
through a narrow lens of risks to national security and the development
of countermeasures to protect against those risks, which, while crucial,
neglects the promise for using the same science to develop life-saving
or other advanced tools for warfighters]{.underline}**. [The Pentagon's
current efforts to take advantage of synthetic biology as a platform for
defense lack internal cohesion and external direction, and biological
innovation faces further challenges given the absence of agile business
models to fully harness emerging biotechnologies for the
battlefield]{.underline}. Greater coordination between those in the
Defense Department whose work relates to biotechnology and improved
relationships with the private sector are important first steps toward
using this burgeoning area of science not just to mitigate security
risks, but also to benefit soldiers on the battlefield.

Defining the Defense Department's Biotech Needs

**[The U.S. military maintained superiority in the area of science and
technology for many decades]{.underline}**. **[However, as emerging
technologies become more accessible, many in the Pentagon became
concerned that adversaries might soon challenge or surpass American
strengths]{.underline}**. **[Synthetic biology]{.underline}**, or the
ability to genetically engineer biology, **[is an increasingly
accessible technological realm]{.underline}**. More broadly, **[the
democratization of biotechnology can enable adversaries to achieve
technological parity]{.underline}**. **[In fact, some global competitors
may be poised to achieve superiority]{.underline}**.
[China]{.underline}, for example, [is not only investing heavily in
biotechnology capabilities, but has dedicated strategies for harnessing
their use in both military and commercial settings]{.underline}. **[The
Defense Department should advance its capabilities in biotechnology not
only because it benefits the mission, but because a mastery of the tools
in this nascent realm provides the best defense against misuse, or
adversaries gaining the edge]{.underline}**.

The Pentagon's Investment in Biotech: A Promising Start

[Most technological innovations are driven by the commercial sector,
rather than the Defense Department]{.underline}. **[This is particularly
true of emerging biotechnology]{.underline}**. [Recognizing this, the
Pentagon has invested in initiatives such as the Defense Innovation
Unit]{.underline} (with an arm in Boston, a hotbed for the biotechnology
industry) [and SOFWERX, to stimulate novel ideas for the
battlefield]{.underline}. [These centers have become incubators for
drones, cyber technology, and an exciting warfighter
exoskeleton]{.underline}, but they have yet to produce specific
biotechnological prototypes. Disappointingly, the new Army Futures
Command to be housed in Austin, Texas, intends to prioritize emerging
technologies for a variety of future needs (including long-range
precision fires, next generation combat vehicles, future vertical lift
platforms, and missile defense capabilities) but the list does not yet
specifically include biotechnology.

[More encouraging, however, is an internal defense investment in
biotechnology capabilities]{.underline}. [The Synthetic Biology for
Military Environments research program crosses all of the service
laboratories]{.underline} (Army, Navy, and Air Force) [and is intended
to develop new bio-based materials and sensors, and harness advances in
warfighter performance through innovations in synthetic
biology]{.underline}. **[The program is also growing biotechnology
expertise by embedding military scientists in academia and at synthetic
biology companies]{.underline}**. Thus far, the initiative has achieved
successes in identifying new organisms that can be engineered for fuels,
materials, and sensors. But the Synthetic Biology for Military
Environments program is funded by a one-time investment. As it
approaches its third and final year, the next steps for these research
discoveries are undecided, and it is unclear whether the initial
investments will be renewed.

Towards a Strategy for Biotech Innovation

[The uncertainty about the program's future is consistent with the lack
of a holistic, overarching Pentagon strategy for incorporating
biotechnology products into deployable tools for the
warfighter]{.underline}. This stems from a traditional and instinctive
linking of biotechnology to medicines and force health protection. But
today, biotechnology's benefits extend far beyond that area --- it can
now also deliver materials, sensors, and fuels. [The disparate
components of biotechnology can also be seen in the way the Defense
Department siloes this field of science]{.underline} --- many different
agencies touch different parts of the proverbial elephant that is
biotechnology. [There are high-risk research and development programs
funded by DARPA, mid-range services research in a wide range of fields,
and medical countermeasures development managed by the Chemical and
Biological Defense Program]{.underline}. [The Defense Health Agency,
responsible for the use of medicines and medical technologies for force
health protection, further complicates the picture]{.underline}.
**[Coordinating these internal components would ensure that policymakers
could visualize all aspects of a biotechnology portfolio]{.underline}**
--- the entire elephant. [This would enable the department to ask
questions like: How can emerging biotechnology improve medical
countermeasure development? What biotechnologies should be prioritized
to improve warfighter performance?]{.underline}

To take just one example: The human "microbiome" comprises the natural
bacteria that dwell in the human digestive tract, and affects digestive
health as well as mental health. The popular pursuit of balancing the
microbiome is evident in the wide range of "probiotics" products
commonly seen in pharmacies --- but for the warfighter, digestive
distress is a real problem during deployments abroad, and can keep them
out of the fight. Synthetic biology now enables specific engineering of
the human gut microbiome that promises to improve digestive health and
cognition --- two areas crucial to warfighter performance. These
microbes could potentially deliver beneficial pharmaceuticals to the
body, either to simply maintain good health in warfighters or to deliver
life-saving medical countermeasures. Conversely, the human microbiome
could be co-opted to harm humans --- for instance, through the
development of agents that can target the natural microbiome or cancel
the effects of therapeutic microbiomes. A comprehensive strategy for
taking advantage of microbiome technology should also include approaches
for countering this potential threat. The risks and benefits of
leveraging the microbiome undeniably cross all the defense biotechnology
silos. By connecting these disparate conversations, the Defense
Department can start determining the best approaches.

Beyond the traditional human health arena, biotechnology presents other
opportunities that prompt broader, crucial questions: What challenges
does the warfighter face that are best solved with biotechnology? What
risks are associated with the adoption of these biotechnologies?
Biological components may play advantageous roles in materials, sensors,
and many other tools. Some of these currently are being designed through
the Synthetic Biology for Military Environments program. For example,
novel biological resins that are both lightweight and flame retardant
could be incorporated into making lighter drones, building lighter
airframes, or fortifying ship hulls. Nanotubes, or ceramics produced
from bioengineered cells, could operate in electronics, organic
batteries, or other instrumentation. But to realize the promise of these
discoveries in military tools and equipment, biotechnology must be a
consideration in creating requirements for products and acquisitions
that are outside of the traditional medical biotechnology siloes. And,
of course, planners should consider any vulnerabilities biotechnological
components may introduce that adversaries could target.

Acquiring Biotech and the 'Valley of Death'

**[Even if all needs for biotechnology were clear, the Defense
Department would still need to improve the way it acquires biotechnology
for the battlefield. Which capabilities should continue to be built in
the department's service research labs, and which ought to be acquired
from external companies?]{.underline}** One option is to simply adopt
useful commercial products off the shelf as they are innovated in the
private sector, particularly since many innovative biological materials
can be dual-purposed for both consumers and the military. For example,
in addition to its promise as lightweight body armor, spider silk can be
used in ordinary clothing, textiles, construction materials, and novel
medicines. Alternatively, the Defense Department could ask the private
sector to create defense-specific products from the ground up. A third
option is to generate prototype products within the department, then use
the private sector to scale and deliver them. Right now, the inability
to scale up synthetic biology products from prototypes is a bottleneck
hindering the broad adoption of biotechnology and the private sector is
already investing in scaling solutions --- whether for commercial
markets or defense. While the answer is likely a combination of all
these approaches, **[the Defense Department needs to communicate clearly
with biotechnology performers, since the private sector is not likely to
make choices for manufacturing products for national security on its
own]{.underline}**.

**[The well-recognized "valley of death" that prevents technological
innovations from being translated into medicines, equipment, and
warfighter benefits is a problem much broader than
biotechnology]{.underline}**. Since World War II, there has been a
steady decline in the defense industrial base, as fewer companies are
able to provide products specific to defense. **[Supply chains have
become burdensome and unwieldy]{.underline}**. For example, the
successful genetic engineering of silk worms to make "dragon silk" for
warfighters is promising. But producing dragon silk at scale will
require thousands of silkworms --- which in turn require a large acreage
of mulberry trees not readily available in the United States. The
company creating dragon silk hopes to use farming cooperatives in
Vietnam to resolve the problem, but this will perpetuate the same kind
of burdensome and costly supply chain that plagues defense acquisitions
--- working through foreign company contracts and embassies, and
generating potential single points of failure through reliance on sole
suppliers outside the country. To reduce these types of inefficiencies,
defense planners must envision biotechnology products from inception
through their full development and manufacture pathways that allow these
technologies to be successfully shepherded through nimbler and more
secure industrial supply chains.

[The "valley of death" also prevents technology companies from seeing
the Defense Department as an attractive customer]{.underline}. The
Pentagon's traditional models for acquisition tend to be time-consuming
and less cost-effective than commercial contracts. Recently, a report
commissioned by the president on the state of the U.S. industrial base
described the uncertainty of federal spending, the unintended
consequences of government acquisition behavior, and the loss of skills
in the domestic workforce as "unprecedented" challenges to defense
manufacturing. **[America's global competitors could be closing the
technology gap because of process failures, rather than a lack of
technology talent or innovative ideas]{.underline}**.

Some Proposed Solutions

**[Strategic coordination of biotechnology for defense could go a long
way toward addressing these challenges]{.underline}**. [A defense-wide
community of interest could enjoin experts from all defense components
that involve biotechnology]{.underline} --- [so that those with the
appropriate expertise could evaluate risks, benefits, and battlefield
needs together]{.underline}. **[This group could ensure that the Defense
Department prioritizes cross-cutting biotechnology needs, whether
through high-risk exploratory research, in-house capabilities, complete
outsourcing, or a combination of these]{.underline}**. **[Innovations
could be encouraged through greater use of incentives and prize
competitions in the defense innovation marketplace and specialized
innovation units]{.underline}**. These diverse stakeholders would be
able to communicate with the biotechnology sector with a single voice
that clearly articulates battlefield needs, while creative
public-private engagements could ensure awareness of potentially
disruptive discoveries. [Importantly, adopted biotechnologies should
receive risk/benefit assessments to identify vulnerabilities; presumably
there could be "chinks" in dragon silk armor that adversaries may
attempt to exploit, potentially through their own developing
biotechnology tools]{.underline}. Finally, ongoing assessment of
potential biothreats posed by synthetic biology should continue, along
with research on how novel biotechnology tools could mitigate those
threats.

### 2AC -- Perm Do Both -- Enhancements Ethical

#### The permutation solves\-\--a [combination]{.underline} of cognitive enhancements and virtue [magnifies]{.underline} ethical capabilities.

**Froding '10** \[Barbro; Senior Researcher at the Division of
Philosophy at KTH; 9-22-2010; \"Cognitive Enhancement, Virtue Ethics and
the Good Life\"; SpringerLink;

[Combining **Cognitive Enhancements** and **Virtue**]{.underline}

So far [it has been argued that **neither** cognitive enhancement nor
virtue ethics is convincing enough **on** **its** **own** as a
**recipe** for the good life for most people]{.underline}. The main
[problem with virtue ethics is that it appears nearly impossible to lead
a fully virtuous and good life.]{.underline} So [while]{.underline} the
[virtues are conducive to good moral behaviour]{.underline}, it is far
from obvious that [most **people** would be able to develop these
**unconditional dispositions** to act, feel and generally respond in
ways **typical of the good person**]{.underline}. It is, of course,
perfectly possible to accept the claim that the fully virtuous life is
the best and most fulfilled life and at the same time accept that it
might be unachievable for most people, or indeed for everyone. Even in
light of such misgivings, however, [it does not follow that the idea of
the virtuous life being the **best** **conceivable life** needs to be
**abandoned**. A **genuine commitment** to virtue as the superior choice
does not]{.underline}, on its own, [provide reasons to
think]{.underline} that [the **virtuous** **life** would have to exclude
**cognitive enhancements**]{.underline}. To the contrary, [it is likely
that some **cognitive enhancements** will prove **conducive** to the
good life and could **enable** a **larger number** of people to
**embark** on the **virtuous path**]{.underline}.

It is often assumed that a virtue ethics approach to the good life would
be incompatible with human cognitive enhancements and that virtue ethics
and human enhancement champion two deeply conflicting ideas. 41 This
appears to be a mistake. Quite to the contrary, it seems that some
[cognitive enhancements might]{.underline} not only [be]{.underline}
[seen as]{.underline} neutral from a virtue perspective but indeed as
[facilitating]{.underline}, for example, [the habituation
process]{.underline}. Notably this is not an attempt to construct an
argument for cognitive enhancements per se, but rather to explore the
best strategy for a happy life, all things considered.

As explained previously, critics of virtue ethics who claim, for
example, that the theory is unachievable and unrealistic, have received
support from findings in the natural sciences. The results indicate that
[most people suffer an array of **cognitive constraints** that could
stand in the way of them developing the virtues and leading the good
life.]{.underline} In general, [humans respond to information
ineffectively, which]{.underline}, in turn, [is likely to lead them to
acquire false beliefs]{.underline}. For example, [being bad at
**deferring judgement** means that we do not **distinguish** well
between **unreliable information** **sources** and **reliable
ones**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [we are afflicted by numerous
cognitive biases and have low impulse control.]{.underline} Such
[findings threaten]{.underline} to cast serious doubts [on a number of
central themes in virtue ethics]{.underline}. Perhaps not unexpectedly,
however, [our expanding technological and medical knowledge might also
provide solutions to these problems in the form of useful cognitive
enhancements for humans.]{.underline}

Very briefly, the idea is that [**cognitive enhancements** might help us
to **overcome** a number of **biological** **constraints** that
**threaten** to **block** the **development** of the
virtues.]{.underline} As previously mentioned [cognitive enhancements
could lift agents to a starting point from which embarking on the
habituation process is a real possibility.]{.underline} In other words;
[neuroenhancers could enable **more people** to become
**virtuous**]{.underline}. This would level the playing field and it
ties in well with wide-spread intuitions about fairness and equality. In
addition to making virtue more attractive as a moral theory, [such a
combination might also strengthen it by making the good life more
achievable and less dependent on luck]{.underline}, which, in turn, fits
very well with the central virtue ethics idea that agents are
responsible for their morality, or lack thereof.

When discussing enhancement it is common to differentiate between
therapeutic use, on the one hand, and use for gaining competitive
advantage over one's peers on the other. The debate is extremely
infected and strong objections (for example on grounds of fairness,
equality, potential social harm and potential risk) have been raised
against the idea of boosting what is considered a normal capacity.
Without getting entrenched in the ethical minefield that attaches to the
topic, it should be noted that I do not wish to argue that all attempts
to gain competitive advantage would be morally flawed. Moreover, even if
we were to extend the practice to include individuals who already
possess normal cognitive capacities, the competitive advantage they
would gain would only be over themselves. What they might overcome would
be their own biological constraints---after all our own biological
make-up is our worst enemy in the quest for the good life.
[Acquiring]{.underline} the [virtues is **intrinsically valuable**, as
doing the **fine** and **noble** is **leading** the happy and good life
and, evidently, for one person to live the **good life** is not in
**conflict** with everyone else also leading the good life.]{.underline}
The [moral and epistemic virtues can hardly be described as
goods]{.underline} which are [available only in limited
supply.]{.underline}Footnote42 Quite to the contrary, as pointed out by
Aristotle, [it is **presumably** **much** **easier** to learn and
maintain **virtuous behaviour** in a **virtuous
society**.]{.underline}Footnote43

Some virtue ethicists might fear that using cognitive enhancements in
this way would distort people's moral development but I believe this to
be unfounded. The position defended here is certainly not that cognitive
enhancements of the kind we have access to today or might have in the
foreseeable future could or should take the place of, for example, the
habituation process. While enhancement will not be a substitute, it may
well work as a facilitator, contributing to making virtue ethics a more
convincing theory to many modern scholars. [If we accept that those
individuals who manage to develop moral and epistemic virtues will, in
general, fare better in life than those who do not]{.underline}, it
seems reasonable to follow Aristotle both in recommending the virtuous
life to others and to seek to lead it ourselves. Indeed, it could even
be argued that [anyone who takes the virtue project seriously should be
prepared to explore this **combination further**.]{.underline}

Another aspect which [merits consideration is that the epistemic and
moral virtues will be increasingly important as we further explore
enhancement]{.underline}. That will increase the likelihood for such
pursuits being undertaken responsibly as agents will improve their sound
judgement and their capacity to discriminate effectively. Hopefully this
could create a platform for responsible---virtuous---enhancement where
various techniques are evaluated on the basis of how well they
contribute to the leading of the good life. Key aspects would of course
be safety, voluntariness, autonomy and informed consent, fairness and
transparency.

//WA

This current critical phase of the crisis in Ukraine has been
manufactured by Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin.
Russian troops, artillery, armored vehicles, tanks and other equipment
encircle Ukraine: they are along the Russian border with Ukraine and in
the annexed territory of Crimea as well as in Belarus, threatening a
major military confrontation. It is hard to identify a specific trigger
for Russia's decision in 2021 to move thousands of personnel and their
armaments close to Ukraine or for the sudden escalation of events in
December 2021. The Kremlin's policy toward Ukraine has towed a hard line
since the early 2000s; and we can certainly point to an accumulation of
factors since Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, annexed Ukraine's
Crimean Peninsula and set off the ongoing war in Ukraine's eastern
Donbas region that has now cost the lives of more than 13,000
Ukrainians. Nonetheless, the timing seems in many respects driven more
by Vladimir Putin's own political predilections and perceptions of
developments and reactions in Ukraine, Europe, and the United States
rather than by events on the ground in the contested Donbas region.
**[Russia's]{.underline}** latest preparation for what now seems like a
potential **[large-scale invasion of Ukraine was]{.underline}** in part
**[sparked by]{.underline}** the current **[Ukrainian government
inviting American and NATO forces to]{.underline}** conduct joint
exercises and **[engage in]{.underline}** other **[military cooperation
to boost Ukraine's defensive capabilities]{.underline}** against further
Russian aggression. Despite the flurry of talks between and among
Russia, the U.S., NATO and other allies---including offers to discuss
Russian security concerns---since President Biden met with President
Putin in Geneva in June 2021, **[Moscow has shown no sign of releasing
the pressure]{.underline}**. Indeed it has ramped up its military
presence in recent weeks. EMBOLDENED IN EURASIA Several factors are at
play for Moscow and Putin. First of all, the past two years have seen
significant changes in Eurasia, where developments seem to have reached
a tipping point. Thirty years since the dissolution of the Soviet Union
in December 2021, and 22 years since Vladimir Putin came to power,
Moscow has successfully reasserted itself as the dominant political
force and security provider in the region. **[Only Ukraine and
the]{.underline}** three **[Baltic States that achieved membership in
both NATO and the European Union]{.underline}** in 2004 **[have managed
to stay beyond Moscow's grip]{.underline}**. The United States never
recognized the Baltic states as part of the USSR after their forcible
reincorporation during World War II. In this context, forcing Kyiv and
its leadership back into Russia's orbit is unfinished business for
Moscow and Vladimir Putin. Ukraine is the regional outlier in what
Russia considers to be its "privileged sphere of interests." **[Kyiv
continues to pursue NATO membership]{.underline}**, close ties with
Europe and its own economic, political, and foreign policy path, as well
as building up its military forces in evident opposition to Russia. In
contrast, other former Soviet states have either been pressured into
closer political and security relations with Moscow or into a neutral,
marginal international status---by Russia leveraging economic and
military ties or exploiting a territorial conflict. As one notable
example, Georgia's current government treads more carefully with Russia
than its predecessor. Russia, of course, invaded Georgia in August 2008.
Georgia's then president, Mikheil Saakashvili, a perennial thorn in
Moscow's side, saw his popularity plummet in the aftermath and was
eventually ousted in an election in 2013. He had a second political
career in exile in Ukraine, but now sits in jail in Tbilisi after an
ill-advised return to Georgia in October 2021. Russian officials and
commentators frequently use Saakashvili and his fate as a cautionary
tale. In November 2021, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of the risks of following
Saakashvili's path. And according to reports from the British government
and intelligence agencies, Moscow has been scheming over the course of
the current crisis potentially to replace Ukrainian President Zelenskyy
with a pro-Kremlin puppet government. Next door to Georgia, in Armenia,
in summer 2020, President Nikol Pashinyan---another leader out of favor
with Moscow---saw his domestic position and foreign policy autonomy
crushed by war with Azerbaijan. Given the fact that Russia and Armenia
have a long-standing defense pact and Russian forces are permanently
based in Armenia, Azerbaijan's military assault to retake territory
occupied by Armenia for three decades is unlikely to have been feasible
without a green light from Moscow. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan resisted
the imposition of Russian forces on the frontlines in Nagorno-Karabakh
after a ceasefire was brokered in 1994, preferring that an international
force oversee the implementation of any final resolution of the
conflict. Russia exploited the 2020 war to introduce its military forces
into Nagorno-Karabakh under the guise of peacekeepers. Russia has now
moved to broker and manage Armenia's future relations with both
Azerbaijan and Turkey, sidelining the OSCE Minsk Group that previously
managed international diplomacy in Nagorno-Karabakh. Elsewhere, in
2020-2021, Belarussian strongman Aleksandr Lukashenko, who infuriated
Moscow with his frequent political overtures to Brussels and Washington
at Russia's expense, was forced back into the fold frightened by the
wrath of his own disgruntled population. Lukashenko and Belarus now host
new contingents of Russian military forces and war game exercises on
Ukraine's northern border. Similarly, in January 2022, Russia and its
regional security alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organization
(CSTO), were called in to quash protests and quell a political power
struggle in Kazakhstan. This was the first time that the CSTO was
deployed to the territory of a member country. Russia feels emboldened
by these developments in Eurasia. The United States played no
significant role in addressing the upheavals. It was conspicuous in its
absence. From Russia's perspective, the United States seems grievously
weakened at home and abroad. **[For]{.underline}** Vladimir
**[Putin]{.underline}**, **[America's political disarray]{.underline}**,
**[President Biden's difficulties in achieving his domestic
agenda,]{.underline}** combined with China's rise at the expense of the
United States since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 seem to
mirror Russia's predicament immediately after the dissolution of the
USSR. In the 1990s, the United States and NATO pressed a politically and
economically beleaguered Russia to withdraw its military forces from
Eastern Europe. In Putin's view, America's predicament **[offers a rare
opportunity. If the United States really is in a state of
collapse]{.underline}** at home and in retreat abroad, as the Kremlin
assesses, **[then perhaps Russia can overturn the last 30 years of
American dominance in European security]{.underline}**, in addition to
constricting Ukraine's independence. SEEING OPPORTUNITY IN EUROPE
**[Moscow also sees ample opportunity to take advantage of developments
in western and eastern Europe]{.underline}**. The reverberations from
Brexit, Poland and Hungary's disputes with the EU, the legacy of four
years of rifts between the U.S. and its European allies during the
tumult of the Trump presidency, the departure of long-serving German
Chancellor Angela Merkel from the political scene, preparations for
presidential elections in France and Washington's precipitous withdrawal
from Afghanistan, have exacerbated other frictions and fractures in NATO
and the EU that Russia can exploit. European military spending and
operational readiness have declined over the last decades relative to
the U.S. and Russia. Despite an uptick in spending and deployments since
Russia annexed Crimea, the two other significant European military
actors, the UK and France, are increasingly at loggerheads, while Turkey
is preoccupied with Syria and the Middle East. **[Russian saber rattling
has fueled European anxieties about their ability to protect NATO and EU
member states from Russian aggression]{.underline}** let alone
non-members like Ukraine. In addition, Europe's punitive financial
tools, along with the political will to deploy them, have been weakened.
Moscow has effectively moved over the past decade of Putin's rule to
shore up the Russian economy against Western sanctions, including
through paying off state debts and making strategic direct investments
in companies across Europe in critical infrastructure, energy, and
metallurgy. As soon as the United States and Europe imposed sanctions on
Russia in response to the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Putin moved to
adopt explicit import substitution policies in defense, food and other
critical sectors. Despite the friction with their governments, Putin
notably still encouraged close business cooperation with all foreign
corporations previously invested in Russia, including American
companies. Putin has long made it clear that he sees the global economy
as a battlefield where he must defend Russia's economic interests and
maximize Moscow's options and leverage. He has instructed Russian
oligarchs in his innermost circle to "de-offshore" or repatriate their
key operations and assets, and diversified Russia's trade relations away
from Europe and the U.S. But he has also assiduously courted
international corporations to give them a direct stake in the Russian
economy. Putin continues to try to deepen ties with the private sectors
of key European countries even at the height of this crisis to off-set
any retaliatory economic actions the West might take. Putin and the
Kremlin believe that European and American investors in Russia, and
those who manage or work in Russian-owned companies in Europe, will
always work in Russia's and their own corporate interests rather than in
support of their governments' positions. They will serve as Russian
allies and advocates for limited sanctions, and they will push for a
speedy reconciliation with Russia, limiting their government's appetites
and capacity for confrontation. For Putin, trade and investment are
means of securing political leverage, along with offering lucrative
positions on Russian corporate boards to former high-ranking Western
politicians and grandees. Putin, for example, recently met with the
heads of leading Italian companies to discuss their business in Russia,
seeing Italy as a potential weak link in European unity. Putin has now
been at this a long time, seeking to create a new version of the Cold
War era mutually assured nuclear destruction in the advent of a
political and economic standoff. If the West pulls the economic
sanctions trigger, Western interests will suffer too. MAXIMALIST
POSITIONS **[Russia's assessment of its opportunities for action in
Eurasia and Europe became clear]{.underline}** in twin documents
submitted to NATO and the U.S. on December 17, 2021. **[Moscow laid out
maximalist positions on three sets of issues: 1) Ukraine; 2) NATO, and
the future expansion of the alliance; and 3) the role of the United
States in European security and internationally]{.underline}**. Against
the backdrop of threats and wargames, the December 17 documents
reinforced Moscow's much-emphasized demand for an ironclad guarantee
from NATO that Ukraine and other former republics of the USSR will not
at any point become members of the alliance. **[Russia's]{.underline}**
December 17 **[documents also demanded an end to further NATO
expansion]{.underline}** (which would preclude close Alliance partners
like Sweden and Finland seeking membership); NATO pulling back forces
and weapons deployed in Eastern Europe since its first round of
expansion to Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary in 1999; and the
withdrawal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Europe. The U.S. and NATO
recently provided written responses to these demands---maintaining their
long-held position that Moscow's demands for a veto over NATO expansion
are non-starters, but underscoring that they are open to discussions on
reforming and refurbishing European security institutions as well as to
negotiations on the disposition of conventional and nuclear forces in
Europe. As far as NATO is concerned, Russia sees the institution as an
extension of the United States, not an alliance based on mutual
interest, collective defense, and voluntary association. **[Moscow
continues to view the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Cold War
terms,]{.underline}** as the equivalent of the Warsaw Treaty
Organization that USSR created as a mirror image and coerced Eastern
Europe into. Russian officials and commentators routinely deny any
agency or independent strategic thought to any NATO member other than
the United States. Note, for example, that Russia has not sent any
similar documents to our North American neighbor, Canada, challenging
its role in European security, despite its membership in both NATO and
the OSCE and close ties to Ukraine. Canada and other countries barely
exist in Russia's calculations. In terms of Russia's opposition to NATO
expansion, Vladimir Putin first put the U.S. and NATO on notice in a
speech at the Munich Security Conference in 2007. Putin asserted that
Russia was rankled by the post-Cold War emergence of a unipolar world
dominated by the United States and by NATO in Europe. Putin emphasized
that Russia could not, and would not, countenance any further expansion
of the Alliance beyond the Baltic states and the seven East European
countries that joined NATO together in 2004. Russia made good on Putin's
"notice" to the Munich Security Conference in August 2008. The Russian
military moved into Georgia in the aftermath of NATO's April 2008
Bucharest Summit, where both Georgia and Ukraine were promised eventual
membership. Russia would have made a similar move against Ukraine then
had the government in Kyiv not stepped back from Ukraine's NATO bid
after seeing what happened to Georgia. But, of course, in 2014, Russia
annexed Crimea and sparked off a war in Donbas, when Moscow thought
Ukraine was trying to find an alternative route to NATO by concluding an
association agreement with the European Union. CONFRONTING THE UNITED
STATES **[As far as the United States is concerned]{.underline}**,
**[Putin has taken Russia's ambitions and positions beyond Eurasia and
Europe]{.underline}**. **[Russia is consolidating relationships with
U.S]{.underline}**. adversaries **[with the]{.underline}** blatantly
**[signaled goal of challenging America's global posture]{.underline}**.
At the end of January, for example, President [Putin met with Iranian
President Ebrahim Raisi to discuss economic, political and military
ties]{.underline}. On January 21, [Russia, Iran and China also began
joint naval drills in the northern Indian Ocean]{.underline},
[performing joint tactical maneuvering and practicing artillery fire at
naval targets, as well as conducting search and rescue missions at
sea]{.underline}. This week, on February 4, presidents [Putin and Xi
will meet in Beijing at the start of the Winter Olympics to discuss the
current situation in and around Ukraine]{.underline}. These are just a
few of many instances of Russian efforts to up the ante and draw our
attention in other theaters. Putin has been quite explicit that
successive Russian threats to deploy new nuclear weapons systems, or
undermine the current international order are a gambit to get the U.S.
to the negotiating table. **[Russia has long sought a commitment from
the U.S., NATO and the Europe Union that it will have a]{.underline}**
clearly **[defined role in]{.underline}** post-Cold War European
**[security institutions and decision-making power]{.underline}**
whenever developments or events run counter to its interests. Russian
officials have expressed frustration about the slow response from the
United States to Moscow's repeated requests to engage since 2008, when
then President Dmitry Medvedev made a proposal for a new European
security order in Berlin. From Moscow's perspective, successive American
administrations have dropped the ball on engaging with Russia to focus
on other foreign policy priorities. Indeed, many observers believed that
the Biden Administration also sought to sideline Russia to concentrate
on China, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change.
**[Putin]{.underline}** was evidently dissatisfied with the slow pace of
bilateral discussions after the first increase of tensions around
Ukraine in spring 2021 and his meeting with President Biden in Geneva in
June. He clearly **[believes that he needs to escalate the situation to
keep us focused on Russia's demands and get ahead of the
U.S]{.underline}**. 2022 midterm elections when our attention will
necessarily be diverted to domestic issues. Putin is also mindful of
2024 when we have our presidential election, and he must submit himself
for reelection at home. In many respects, time is of the essence for
Putin to achieve resolution well before 2024. His public opinion ratings
are not what they used to be. The last time Putin's popular approval
fell significantly was before the annexation of Crimea. Annexation
proved universally popular in Russia, boosting Putin's popularity to
stratospheric levels. **[Putin may hope for a similar
boost]{.underline}** ahead of 2024 by **[showing the Russian people that
he can take decisive action against Ukraine, NATO and the United
States]{.underline}**. In the meantime, at home in Russia, **[Putin has
done a good job of making the United States and NATO look like the
aggressors and perpetrators of crisis]{.underline}**. Abroad, he is bent
on convincing the rest of the world that Ukraine is either an internal
matter for Russia to resolve or the object of a Cold War-style dust up
with the United States---a proxy war like Korea or Vietnam in the worst
case scenario. In recent Russian polling, half of Russians believed that
the U.S. and NATO were to blame for the crisis, and only a tiny fraction
thought that Russia itself was to blame. In stark contrast, slightly
more than 70 percent of Ukrainians viewed Russia as a hostile state by
December 2021 as a result of the rising tensions -- up from 60 percent
in spring 2021.

### 2AC -- AT: Plan Unethical

[The neuroscience technologies shown in the roadmap]{.underline} in
Figure 2 are those presented in section 2 plus wearable neuroscience
technologies, since they [appear to be a natural evolution of current
technologies that will likely be available in the future.]{.underline}
If past trends are the best predictors of future ones, [then both
significant improvements to existing technologies and new technologies
for recording and stimulating brain activity should be expected in the
medium to long term.]{.underline} It is likely that the [development of
each technology will continue over the next two decades]{.underline},
considering the advantages provided by each (see section 2).
Non-invasive techniques will still remain central thanks to their
continuous development and increased reliability. [At present and in the
context of potential applications, EEG, and fNIRS possibly offer the
best compromise, particularly thanks to their portability, low-cost,
non-invasiveness, and widespread adoption]{.underline} in current BCI
and neuroergonomics studies. In the future, EEG is likely to become even
more practical if dry electrode technology continues to develop at its
current pace (Lopez-Gordo et al., 2014). However, [it is expected that
over time invasive brain-activity observation techniques, such as ECoG
or implanted electrodes, will become **progressively more ethically**
and medically **acceptable**]{.underline}, particularly if the long term
risks associated with their presence inside the body are proven minor.
After all, many forms of body modification are already accepted both for
medical (e.g., pace makers, laser vision-correction, and cochlear
implants) and aesthetic (e.g., face-lifts, body piercing, or tattoos)
reasons. If that is the case, [invasive techniques will offer a more
precise and effective way of observing brains in action, particularly if
the recent trends in recording technology]{.underline} (Qiao et al.,
2016; Pesaran et al., 2018) continue. In relation to neurostimulation
technologies, at present and in the context of potential applications,
the best compromise is offered by tES, which is portable, generally
cheap, and non-invasive. For brief exposures, this technology appears to
be low-risk, and the recent development of a higher-definition form of
tES suggests that further improvements are forthcoming. Energy
considerations make it difficult to imagine how TMS could ever become
portable. In the future, it appears as if FUS may become superior to
both technologies in terms of resolution and portability (portable
ultrasound devices already exist on the market, suggesting the
feasibility of making FUS portable), but it is unclear whether it will
ever be possible to stimulate multiple sites and large areas of the
brain at once. [If invasive techniques, such as implanted electrodes,
ever become acceptable, they will of course offer a more direct and
precise way to modulate brain activity.]{.underline} The roadmap in
Figure 2 shows the trend of development of the main applications of
neuroscience technologies reviewed in section 3[.]{.underline} In the
forecast horizon of the roadmap (a period of over two decades), [an
acceleration of these developments is likely, particularly as
**ethical**, medical, and technological obstacles **are progressively
removed**, paving the way to making invasive brain-activity observation
technologies viable.]{.underline} In general, it can be expected that
[BCIs for communication and control will have improved sufficiently to
become routinely used particularly in domains where higher than
musculoskeletal reaction times are important or where covert
communication is required.]{.underline} However, [it is also clear that
within this time frame many neuroscience technologies for augmenting
human performance will continue to transition]{.underline} (having
currently just started) outside the lab for field testing with some even
in routine use. For instance, significant progress can be expected to be
made in innovative applications in training and selection of personnel,
decision-making, cognitive monitoring, and situation awareness, given
their current initial successes. Finally, it should be noted that all
forms of enhancement based on neurostimulation look, at present,
extremely promising, although they still present risks. For instance,
facilitation of one function might be expected to be associated with
loss of some other, often unknown function. Furthermore, research on the
long term effects of such technologies is lacking. For these two
reasons, the future of stimulation technologies is harder to predict as
their currently formidable expansion would likely come to a sudden halt
if future research reveals that they have severe permanent side effects.
Fear of change and of the unknown is understandable. Fuelled by this,
[often the ethical debate appears to focus on what is conceivable,
rather than on what is scientifically foreseeable]{.underline} (i.e.,
there being only technological limits to its attainment) [and what is
already reality. This may lead to illogical and unexpected
outcomes.]{.underline} As [it is difficult to predict the exact future
trajectory of neuroscience, neuroergonomics, BCIs, and human
augmentation technologies, it is also difficult to predict how
neuroethics,]{.underline} i.e., how society, [will look at such
technologies. It,]{.underline} therefore, [critically important to track
ethical implications, particularly in areas such as mind reading and
privacy, agency, responsibility, and liability.]{.underline} Given the
recent trajectory of neuroscience, BCIs, neuroergonomics,
brain-to-brain-communication and neural engineering, and their
formidable expansion, [such applications may one day become reality,
and, so, they deserve to be ethically debated. However, **none of the
ethical issues**]{.underline} mentioned in section 4 [**appear to be a
show stopper** for human enhancing neurotechnologies.]{.underline} Some
[issues can be tackled technologically.]{.underline} For instance,
[preventing (future) BCIs from inadvertently communicating private
thoughts or emotions could easily be achieved by requiring users to
issue a particular sequence of mental commands]{.underline} (akin to the
password required to unlock the screen of a smartphone) [to switch the
BCI on and off]{.underline} (in fact this is already an element of the
family of so called "self-paced" BCIs). For other issues[, it is
possible to simply apply ethical standards already accepted in similar
situations]{.underline} (for example Smidt, 2000). One can expect that
[over time ethical thinking will progressively change as a result of
society being exposed to neuroscience technologies for human
augmentation resulting in further acceleration in their development and
adoption.]{.underline} Nonetheless, as neurotechnologies evolve, **[the
development and adaptation of clear ethical regulation is becoming more
and more pressing.]{.underline}**

#### Modifying humans is [completely]{.underline} ethical

**Savulescu & Kahane 09** (SAVULESCU, J. and KAHANE, G. (2009), THE
MORAL OBLIGATION TO CREATE CHILDREN WITH THE BEST CHANCE OF THE BEST
LIFE. Bioethics, 23: 274-290.

In technical terms, PB is a maximizing principle. This has suggested to
some that it must be vulnerable to standard objections to such
principles. In this section we\'ll consider such objections. But first
let us correct the mistaken impression that because PB is a maximizing
principle, it must belong in a consequentialist ethical theory. [Both
consequentialists and **the vast majority** of their opponents **agree
that there is moral reason to promote the good**.]{.underline} Where
they differ is over whether there are moral constraints that limit the
promotion of the good. In fact, within total act utilitarianism, [PB
could not be an independent moral principle but only a label for one
kind of value that needs to be weighed in utilitarian
deliberation.]{.underline} Indeed, the right act for a total act
utilitarian will sometimes be to create a child with prospects for a
poor life, if this will lead to a higher aggregate level of wellbeing.
For example, it might be better for some parents to have a dull, lazy
child than a highly intelligent and challenging child who herself would
have a better life. PB may often clash with total act utilitarianism,
although it is compatible with other forms of consequentialism. There is
nothing in the PB that makes it incompatible with non-consequentialist
moral theories. It is compatible, for example, with respecting persons
as ends in themselves. We are not treating a future child merely as a
means when we aim to have the child who will enjoy the most advantaged
life -- reasons of PB are not reasons of parental self-interest. And PB
is also an extension of one central parental virtue: concern for the
well-being of one\'s children. As such, it is equally compatible with
virtue ethics.37 Furthermore, we have argued that reasons of PB can be
outweighed or defeated by other reasons, and these reasons may be
non-consequentialist in origin, such as reasons of justice. Even if PB
is compatible with non-consequentialist views, it might still be
vulnerable to familiar objections to maximizing moral principles. For
example, several authors have claimed that PB is too demanding -- that
it places too stringent a burden on parents. As Glover argues, There is
something to be said for avoiding the intrusion of too many or too
stringent moral obligations into an intimate personal decision. There is
a case against placing additional moral burdens on people having
children, a case for simply welcoming whatever children is born.38 It
has indeed seemed to many that morality couldn\'t require us to give up
our personal projects and special ties to family and friends in order to
increase the welfare of total strangers.[39 Reasons of PB, however, are
continuous with familiar parental duties governing the spacing of our
children and the circumstances under which we should have them. It is
not uncommon to hear the criticism, 'They should have waited to have
children.' **To the extent that parents have reasons to care about the
expected well-being of their future children, these reasons can be seen
as extensions of parents\' special relations to their own children**,
not as the external demand of an impartial morality.]{.underline}40
Second, it is doubtful that the choice itself could be described as a
burden. If parents believe, or would believe if they had reflected on
the available information, that child A will have a better life than
child B, how can it be a burden to select A? There is an important
disanalogy here from many acts that promote the well-being of existing
children. In many cases, the more an act promotes well-being (e.g.
taking a child to speech therapy), the greater its cost (in terms of
time and money). Now whether parents should undergo IVF in order to
select the most advantaged child does depend on the costs -- financial,
emotional and physical. But in those cases where couples are already
undergoing IVF for infertility or risk of genetic disorder, there are no
significant further costs to selecting the most advantaged child
compared to selecting a child without Down Syndrome.41 If parents have
already committed themselves to spending a certain amount on their
child\'s education, what further burden do they bear in selecting the
better school out of several similarly priced options? Perhaps what is
meant is rather that raising a child with extraordinary talents may be a
burden to normal parents. This may be true in some cases. But whether
and when can only be settled empirically. Another objection to
maximizing principles is that they are self-defeating. If all a person
aims to do is promote her self-interest, then she may find this aim
self-defeating. She may have a better life precisely by being concerned
about many things other than her self-interest. Directly and exclusively
seeking happiness may make a person miserable. Couldn\'t this be said of
seeking to have the most advantaged children?42 Notice first that this
is not an objection to the truth of PB but to using it as a direct guide
to action. In any case, [this objection couldn\'t plausibly apply to the
promotion of our biological and psychological potential and abilities.
How can the capacity to remember things better, concentrate longer, be
less depressed, or better understand other people\'s feelings have the
effect that one will be less likely to achieve the good
life?]{.underline} It may be self-defeating in some circumstances to aim
directly at achieving the good, but it is surely sensible to aim
directly at achieving the potential to be able to realize the good. [If
it is not self-defeating to alter the educational environment to
maximize our children\'s potential and opportunities, **why is it
self-defeating to intervene more directly in their psychology or
biology?**]{.underline} Parents who obsess about their child\'s
well-being and future accomplishment may indeed make their child less
rather than more happy or accomplished. But this has nothing to do with
the act of selection itself. Selecting the best is not, in this way,
self-defeating, as compared to letting nature or chance take their
course. It is subsequent attitudes to the child that may cause such
damage. But if so, then this is no real objection to PB.43 It is an
objection to certain styles of 'hyperparenting'.44 There is one way in
which PB may be self-defeating. One factor that can influence how well a
person\'s life goes is her position on a range of positional goods --
how she ranks compared to others on attributes such as intelligence and
height. Not everyone can be the most intelligent or the tallest. But, to
the extent that genetic selection is available to many reproducers, then
whether and to what degree a given feature is likely to benefit their
future child will thus often depend in part on other parents\' genetic
choices. Such coordination problems pose a genuine difficulty. But
parents already face such difficulties with many decisions they make
with respect to existing children. Moreover, many such goods are not
purely positional. The world and the lives of the people in it might be
better if everyone were funnier, more intelligent, more empathetic and
less aggressive. And in so far as such joint action has significant
social costs, these costs would provide independent reasons for
restricting parental choice.

## 2AC -- AT: K -- Ableism

The ideas developed within [CDS draw heavily on concepts developed in
other areas of difference including ethnicity, sexuality and
gender]{.underline}. Whilst it is not simply about conflating different
approaches together with that of disability studies, the case for
similarities are readily made (Shildrick 2012). McCruer (2010), for
example, drawing on the ideas of Judith Butler juxtaposes [compulsory
heterosexuality with compulsory ablebodiedness]{.underline}, arguing
[that privileging heterosexuality and ablebodiedness acts to the
detriment of others]{.underline}. The argument is that [by disrupting
the categories disabled/ non-disabled, the discrimination experienced by
disabled people can be challenged.]{.underline} This attempt at what
Sayer (2011) has called [normative disorientation]{.underline} found in
much of the theorizing around ableism creates problems. For example,
**[how can we]{.underline}** discuss or **[debate
prevention]{.underline}** [when a feature of ableism is]{.underline}
described as [a 'belief that impairment]{.underline} (irrespective of
"type") [is inherently negative which should, if the opportunity
presents itself, be ameliorated, cured or indeed
eliminated']{.underline} (Campbell 2009b, 23)? [Is]{.underline} the
promotion of the use of [folic acid]{.underline} before and [during
pregnancy]{.underline} based on an anti-disablist or perhaps
[ableist]{.underline} viewpoint; and if so, should CDS be campaigning
against those who seek to promote these views? This gap is acknowledged
by Meekosha (2011), but it has not been examined or unpacked. Whilst we
may be accused here of constructing a 'straw person argument' it is
consistent with Campbell\'s claim. [This challenge to normativity, of
what is good or bad, or right or wrong, characterizes much of the CDS
literature]{.underline}. Whilst [CDS]{.underline} often **[makes
normative judgements]{.underline}** 640 S. Vehmas and N. Watson [about
policies or]{.underline} about the current [understanding of
disability]{.underline} or how contemporary social organization is
morally wrong, [it offers **no evaluative arguments** on impairments or
on the implications of living with an impairment.]{.underline} Shildrick
(2012, 40), for example, has argued that 'all bodies are unstable and
vulnerable' and that there is 'no single acceptable mode of embodiment'.
Shildrick attempts a move to an ethical realm by posing what she
describes as 'an important ethical question: how can we engage with
morphological difference that is not reducible to the binary of either
sameness or difference?' And, in line with this rather leading question,
she continues: 'If we are to have an ethically responsible encounter
with corporeal difference, then, we need a strategy of queering the
norms of embodiment, a commitment to deconstruct the apparent stability
of distinct and bounded categories' (Shildrick 2012, 40). In Shildrick's
view, any strategy, political arrangement, or ethical conceptualization
that is based on a group identity built upon a binary distinction or
difference, is ethically wrong. This is an interesting suggestion but
unfortunately Shildrick does not provide any ethical argument to support
it or a practical example of how it may be enacted. It is, as Shildrick
argues, safe to suggest that there is no 'single acceptable mode of
embodiment', but at the same time it seems equally safe to suggest that
there are a lot of people who would argue that some forms of embodiment
are preferential to others. Seeing impairments as acceptable forms of
human diversity is not the same as seeing them as neutral or
insignificant. When people say that some forms of embodiment are
preferential to others, they are ultimately referring to ideas about
human well-being. In other words, one reason why people generally prefer
not to have impairments is ethical; they believe that some impairments
may in and of themselves prevent people from acting and moving as they
wish, from doing valued activities, or faring well in general. Thomas
(1999) coined the term 'impairment effects' to define these limitations
and to separate them from those that arise from disablement. [CDS is
normative as well, albeit its normative focus is on social factors
instead of individuals' abilities]{.underline}. [CDS]{.underline}, like
the social model, [contains a strong normative dimension that implies
what is right or wrong as regards social arrangements]{.underline}, [but
neither model takes a clear normative approach to the lived, embodied
and visceral experiences of having an impairment]{.underline} (Vehmas
2004). [Human beings are dialogical]{.underline} beings and [the
significance of disability or impairment and their impact on well-being
will tend to be comparative]{.underline}. As Sayer argues: 'we measure
ourselves not so much against absolute standards but against what others
are like, particularly those with whom we associate the most' (2011,
122). Evaluative judgements in relation to the individual experience of
both disability and impairment are important. If we are to properly
understand social phenomena, such as disability, **[we have to
recognize]{.underline}** their [**normative dimensions** and the values
attached to them]{.underline}. [Value-laden statements]{.underline}, as
Sayer (2011) argues, can [strengthen the descriptive adequacy of
accounts]{.underline}. Sayer demonstrates this by using the example of
the Holocaust. This, he says, can be represented in two ways:
'[thousands died in the Nazi concentration camps' and 'thousands were
systematically exterminated in the Nazi concentration
camps']{.underline}. [The latter sentence is]{.underline} not only
**[more value-laden]{.underline}** than the first, [but **more
accurate**]{.underline} as well (Sayer 2011, 45). We would argue that
[talking about ableism, disablism or oppression does not make sense
without reference to normative judgements about people's
well-being]{.underline}, as [without such a discussion only a partial
picture will emerge.]{.underline} The same may also apply to judgements
about fair social arrangements. Disability & Society 641 [CDS does not
engage with ethical issues to do with the role of impairment and
disability in people's well-being and the pragmatic and mundane issues
of day-today living]{.underline}. Imagine, for example, a pregnant woman
who has agreed, possibly with very little thought, to the routine of
prenatal diagnostics, and who has been informed that the foetus she is
carrying has Tay-Sachs disease. She now has to make the decision over
whether to terminate the pregnancy or carry it to term. The value
judgements that surround [Tay-Sachs]{.underline} include the fact that
it [will cause pain and suffering to the child]{.underline} and he or
she will probably die before the age of four. These are morally relevant
considerations to the mother. [Whilst CDS would]{.underline} probably
guide her to [confront ableist assumptions]{.underline} and challenge
her beliefs about the condition, [considerations having to do with pain
and suffering are nevertheless morally significant.]{.underline} [The
way people see things, and the language that is used to describe certain
conditions, can affect how they react to them, but freeing oneself from
ableist assumptions may not in some cases be enough]{.underline}. [There
may be insurmountable realities attached to some
impairments]{.underline} [where parents feel that their personal and
social circumstances would not enable them to provide the child or
themselves with a satisfactory life]{.underline} (Vehmas 2003).
[Impairment]{.underline} sometimes [produces **practical, difficult
ethical choices**]{.underline} [and we need]{.underline}
[more]{.underline} **[concrete viewpoints]{.underline}** [than the ideas
provided through **ableism**]{.underline}, [which
**offers**]{.underline} very **[little practical moral
guidance]{.underline}**. It is questionable whether the notion of
ableism would help the parents in deciding whether to have a child who
has a degenerative condition that results in early death. Campbell
(2009a, 39, 149 and 159), for example, discusses arguments about
impairments as harmful conditions, the ethics of external bodily
transplants as well as wrongful birth and life court cases (whether life
with an impairment is preferable to non-existence), and how ableism
impacts on discourse around these issues. Whilst her analysis of such
ableist discourses suggests ethical judgements, she provides no
arguments or conclusions as to whether, for example, external bodily
transplants are ethically wrong or whether impairment may or may not
constitute a moral harm. [Under the anti-dualistic stance adopted by
CDS]{.underline}, [even]{.underline} the [well-being/ill-being dualism
becomes an arbitrary and nonsensical construct]{.underline}. [Under
ableism it can be]{.underline} constructed as merely [maintaining the
dominance of those seemingly faring well]{.underline} (supposedly,
'non-disabled' people), [and labels those faring less well as having
lesser value]{.underline}. There may not be a clear answer to what
constitutes human well-being or flourishing, but in general we can and
we need to agree about some necessary elements required for well-being.
Also, [as moral agents we have an obligation to make judgements about
people's well-being and act in ways that their well-being is
enhanced]{.underline} (Eshleman 2009). This is why we have, for example,
coronary heart disease prevention programmes because the [possible death
or]{.underline} associated [health problems are]{.underline} seen as
[harms]{.underline}. Possibly these policies are based on ableist
perspective, but if that is the case then **[the normative use of
ableism is null]{.underline}**; [eradicating]{.underline} supposedly
[ableist]{.underline} [enterprises such as coronary heart disease
prevention would be an example of reductio ad absurdum]{.underline}.
[Denying]{.underline} [some]{.underline} aspects of [well-being are so
clear that their denial would be absurd, and]{.underline} simply
[morally wrong]{.underline}. [CDS raises ethical issues and insinuates
normative judgements but does not provide supporting ethical
arguments]{.underline}. [This is a way of shirking from intellectual and
ethical responsibility]{.underline} [to provide]{.underline} sound
[arguments and]{.underline} conceptual [tools]{.underline} for ethical
decision-making [that would benefit disabled people]{.underline}. If we
are to describe disability, 642 S. Vehmas and N. Watson disablism, and
oppression properly, we have to explicate the moral and political wrong
related to these phenomena. Whilst CDS has produced useful analyses, for
example, of the cultural reproduction of disability, it needs to engage
more closely with the evaluative issues inherently related to
disability. As Sayer has argued (against Foucault): while one could
hardly disagree that we should seek to uncover the hidden and
unconsidered ideas on which practices are based, I would argue that
critique is indeed exactly about identifying what things 'are not right
as they are', and why. (Sayer 2011, 244) [By settling]{.underline}
almost exclusively [to analyses of ableism]{.underline} [without
engaging]{.underline} properly [with the ethical issues involved, **CDS
analyses are deficient**. The moral wrongs related to disablism or
ableism are matters of great concern to disabled people]{.underline},
and CDS should in its own part take the responsibility of remedying
current wrongs disabled people suffer from.

diversity\'**]{.underline}.4 18 But, we worry, getting to that actually
have an adverse effect on people with disabilities. For in the short
term, BCIs largely will be developed under a biomedical rubric, designed
for the use of people with the most pervasive mobility impairments.
Although [commercial spin-offs]{.underline} for a wider market are

oversimplified view of the challenges of impairmen]{.underline}t.

[risks]{.underline} we have described. We hope to have shown here that
further reflection on the boundaries of the felt \'body\' will be both
(1) necessary and (2) far from sufficient for assessing the promises and

Transhumanists and other [proponents of enhancement have been criticized
for their attitude to disability]{.underline}. Melinda Hall argues that
[transhumanists]{.underline} denigrate [disabled people by devaluing
interdependence and vulnerability]{.underline}, and [implying that
disabled people are dangerous.]{.underline} It might also be thought
that [further development of enhancement technologies would have bad
consequences within current, ableist and otherwise oppressive social
contexts.]{.underline} This paper responds to these objections, arguing
that **[enhancement needn\'t be in conflict with disability
justice]{.underline}**. [While enhancements can be used]{.underline} and
promoted [in ways that reinforce ableism]{.underline} and other
oppression, ways of [mitigating these problems might be found by drawing
on ideas from the **disability rights movement**]{.underline}, and
social justice movements more broadly. The development of [more
accessible environments]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} a general
[openness to surprises about which traits promote
well-being]{.underline}, [can]{.underline} help to [create conditions
under which people have **genuine choice over which enhancement
technologies, if any, to use**.]{.underline}

Is there something inherently ableist about enhancement? Can the
promotion of enhancement coexist with the promotion of disability
rights? This paper will engage with these questions by responding to
criticism of enhancement from the perspective of disability justice.
Engaging with these critiques is important for at least two reasons. One
is that, if some disability activists have concerns about enhancement,
these concerns should be taken seriously, and, because ableist and other
oppressive assumptions can be easy to miss, should not be dismissed
without careful reflection. Whether these critiques are entirely
successful or not, there are important lessons to learn from them.

A second reason is that they might offer an alternative angle on
enhancement. [Arguments against enhancement]{.underline} typically [rely
on a distinction between treatment of disorder and enhancement of
healthy traits to argue that]{.underline}, [while treatment should be
encouraged, enhancement should not be pursued]{.underline}.11 Daniels,
N. (2000). **[Normal functioning and the treatment-enhancement
distinction]{.underline}**. Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics,
9(3), 309--322; Sandel, M. (2004, April). [The case against
perfection]{.underline}. The Atlantic, 51--62. This distinction **[is
difficult to support]{.underline}**. Even if it is possible to
distinguish between treatment and enhancement, [it is hard to see why
the distinction would be morally significant]{.underline}.22 Resnik, D.
(2000). The moral significance of the therapy-enhancement distinction in
human genetics. Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics, 9, 365--377;
Kamm, F. (2005). Is there a problem with enhancement? The American
Journal of Bioethics, 5(3), 5--14. Showing that [the]{.underline}
[treatment/enhancement distinction is unsupportable]{.underline},
however, does not show that all arguments against enhancement have been
defeated. Perhaps enhancements are problematic, but so too are some
treatments. [Some disability activists have criticized the practice of
selecting against disabled embryos or]{.underline}, more broadly, the
societal focus on [disability cures]{.underline}.33 Asch, A., &
Wasserman, D. (2005). Where is the sin in synecdoche? Prenatal testing
and the parent-child relationship. In D. Wasserman, R. Wachbroit, & J.
Bickenbach (Eds.), Quality of life and human difference: Genetic
testing, health care, and disability (pp. 172--216). Cambridge
University Press; Clare, E. (2017). Brilliant imperfection: Grappling
with cure. Duke University Press. [Those]{.underline} who hold this view
of disability [needn\'t rely on a treatment/enhancement
distinction]{.underline} in their criticism of enhancement. Considering
[the case against enhancement in its strongest form should]{.underline}
therefore [include]{.underline} [engaging with arguments that do not
rely on the treatment/enhancement distinction]{.underline}, or on
dubious ideas of normal functioning.

Each section of this paper responds to a disability-related objection to
enhancement. An especially detailed critique of enhancement, especially
of transhumanists, its strongest proponents, is presented by Melinda
Hall, and I take her arguments to be representative of
disability-related concerns about these ideas. Thus, five of the six
objections I discuss are drawn from Hall\'s work: that aiming to develop
mind uploading and lifespan extension technologies devalues our
vulnerability, rejecting and making an enemy of the disabled body; that
the transhumanist emphasis on autonomy presupposes an atomistic
conception of the self, thereby devaluing disabled people on the basis
that dependence and interdependence are undesirable; that transhumanism
denigrates people with cognitive disabilities; that it depoliticizes the
relationship between disability and well-being; and that the promotion
of moral enhancement combined with the recommendation to use genetic
selection implies that disabled people are dangerous and do not belong
in optimistic visions of the future. Finally, I consider the idea that,
even if enhancement is a good thing in the abstract, it will have net
bad consequences within currently existing, oppressive social contexts.

[Not all enhancement advocates would describe themselves as
transhumanists]{.underline}. Some of the enhancements I discuss, such as
mind uploading, are radical enough that describing their proponents as
transhumanists seems reasonable, but the same is not necessarily true of
all enhancements discussed here. Nevertheless, in this paper I will
frequently refer to 'transhumanism' or 'transhumanists'. Much of the
literature I draw upon uses that terminology, so I will follow the same
practice. Many of the critiques I discuss, however, are aimed at a
broader group of enhancement advocates. Hall, for instance, refers to
'\[t\]ranshumanist thinkers... and fellow travelers who claim
enhancement is a moral obligation'.44 Hall, M. (2020). Second thoughts
on enhancement and disability. In D. Wasserman & A. Cureton (Eds.), The
Oxford handbook of philosophy and disability (pp. 633--650). Oxford
University Press, p. 633. A natural reading of this quote would be that
Hall intends to limit her critique to those who believe individuals have
a moral obligation to use enhancement technologies. However, as I
discuss in Section 3, [Bostrom]{.underline}, one of the two primary
targets of Hall\'s critique, h[as explicitly stated that people should
be able to choose whether to use enhancement technologies or
not]{.underline}. It might be thought, therefore, that she is critiquing
those who hold that enhancement is a moral obligation in the sense that
society has an obligation to develop enhancements and make them widely
available. In using the term 'transhumanism', then, I do not intend to
draw a sharp distinction between transhumanists and other proponents of
enhancement, and none of my arguments depend on any particular view
about where that line should be drawn.

In responding to these critiques, I am not primarily interested in
evaluating whether particular arguments in the literature are ableist.
Given the pervasiveness of ableism, and the close connections between
disability and enhancement, it would be surprising if there were no
ableism within transhumanist and other enhancement literature. Ableist
arguments should of course be criticized wherever they are found, but
where there is ableism in the arguments for a given position, it is
worth asking whether the ableism is intrinsic to the view, or whether
that element can be removed, keeping the core idea intact. My aim, then,
will be to evaluate whether transhumanism, and other pro-enhancement
views, are inherently ableist.

I will argue that [the core commitments of]{.underline} transhumanists
and other proponents of [enhancement]{.underline} [need not]{.underline}
necessarily [be in conflict with disability justice]{.underline}. That
does not mean, of course, that there is no ableism within transhumanism,
or no potential for enhancement to increase disability stigma. I suggest
that the potential for [ableism can be reduced by incorporating ideas
developed within philosophy of disability and the disability rights
movement, such as universal design, and taking seriously people\'s
testimony about their quality of life.]{.underline}

The first criticism I respond to is that [the pursuit of enhancement
involves a problematic attitude to vulnerability]{.underline}. Two types
of enhancement, both advocated for by Nick Bostrom, will be especially
relevant here. First, [the slowing or reversal of aging
processes]{.underline} so as to delay death and extend lifespans as far
as possible.55 Bostrom, N. (2005). The fable of the dragon-tyrant.
Journal of Medical Ethics, 31(5), 273--277. Second, the more radical
prospect of [transferring a person\'s mind to a computer]{.underline},
often known as 'mind uploading'.66 Bostrom, N. (2005). Transhumanist
values. Journal of Philosophical Research, 30(Suppl.), 3--14, p. 7. The
word 'vulnerability' has multiple meanings, and there are multiple
senses in which we might think it desirable to accept or embrace it, not
all of which are relevant to this discussion. We might, for instance,
value emotional vulnerability, but I will not discuss that here because
[Hall is criticizing transhumanists for their attitude to **bodily
vulnerability**]{.underline}. It is also worth distinguishing between
wanting to reduce vulnerability, on the one hand, and being in denial
about it, on the other. [It may be unwise]{.underline}, for instance,
[to ignore pain, or]{.underline} one\'s need for [rest and
sleep]{.underline}; [treating one\'s body as invincible may]{.underline}
actually [lead to damage.]{.underline} [We might]{.underline} also
[criticize social norms that treat]{.underline} our [vulnerability
as]{.underline} a [taboo]{.underline} subject. Again, these senses of
[denying or avoiding vulnerability will not be relevant to the
discussion]{.underline}.

[Hall objects to transhumanism because it seeks to reduce, as far as
possible, our bodily vulnerability to disease and death.]{.underline}
This is because of what she takes it to imply about disabled people:
[according to her, the 'enemy' of transhumanism is 'the disabled body
itself']{.underline}.77 Hall, M. (2013). Vile sovereigns in bioethical
debate. Disability Studies Quarterly, 33(4).
https://dsq-sds.org/article/view/3870/3406,
https://www-academia-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/2434257/Vile_Sovereigns_in_Bioethical_Debate
By way of further explanation she writes, '[If the]{.underline}
(traditionally, that is, unenhanced) [abled body is figured as
constraint and vulnerability to death]{.underline}, [the]{.underline}
(traditionally) [disabled body]{.underline} likely [symbolizes
an]{.underline} even greater degree of [unwanted constraint and
vulnerability to death]{.underline}'.88 Ibid: 15. Ladelle McWhorter
echoes this objection when she says of transhumanist literature, '[The
body rejected in these texts is not merely a dependent body but a loser
body]{.underline}---a slack body, a slow body, a body without the quick
right answer, a [penetrable]{.underline} body, a body [riven by
pain']{.underline}.99 McWhorter, L. (2017). Symposium on Melinda Hall\'s
The Bioethics of Enhancement (McWhorter). Discrimination and
disadvantage.

Section 1. As Hall and McWhorter see it, then, [the avoidance of
vulnerability is a rejection of the disabled body, and]{.underline}
presumably thus [of disabled people]{.underline}. [Hall contrasts this
attitude with her]{.underline} own ap[proach of 'viewing human life as
fundamentally vulnerable and interdependent in valuable
ways']{.underline}.1010 Hall, M. (2016). The bioethics of enhancement:
Transhumanism, disability, and biopolitics. Lexington Books, p. xxi.

It is certainly possible that some people have bad motives for using or
desiring enhancement. Perhaps some people want to use enhancements
simply because they want to avoid having a 'loser body', out of disdain
for what they perceive as the weakness of disabled people or other
groups. But [do enhancement practices necessarily express such an
attitude]{.underline}? [That seems **unlikely**]{.underline}, [given how
we]{.underline} so [often treat our bodily vulnerability]{.underline} to
disease and death [as undesirable]{.underline}. Indeed, Hall treats it
as such when [she argues that bioethics literature on enhancement
'creates and directs risk rather than identifying and mitigating
it']{.underline}, and then lists examples of disabled people having
difficulty accessing medical care.1111 Hall, op. cit. note 4, p. 642,
emphasis in Hall. So, on the one hand, [she criticizes transhumanists
for wanting to reduce vulnerability rather than treating it as valuable,
yet on the other hand, she]{.underline}, rightly, [criticizes practices
that leave disabled people 'vulnerable to medical negligence and even
death'.]{.underline}1212 Ibid: 642. Note that she is not merely arguing
that transhumanists have failed by their own lights, in that they aim to
decrease risk and vulnerability but have actually increased it, although
that does seem to be part of her argument. [She takes the ways in which
disabled people are subjected to additional risk of disease and death to
be unjust, as they of course are.]{.underline}

[What, then, makes the kinds of risk and vulnerability that disabled
people are subjected to through bioethics discourse, or society in
general, different to the kinds of risk and vulnerability Bostrom seeks
to overcome]{.underline}? [Hall says very little]{.underline} about how
she makes that distinction, but I will consider three possible
differences. [First]{.underline}, Hall argues that the [risks associated
with disability are]{.underline} significantly **[social and political,
rather than]{.underline}** primarily or mostly
**[biological]{.underline}**.1313 Ibid: 645. If this is to work as a way
of making the distinction, [one would need to hold that,]{.underline} by
contrast, [the risks Bostrom is concerned with are]{.underline}
primarily **[biological rather than social]{.underline}**. However,
[Bostrom\'s claims about the problems with our bodies can be **framed as
societal** issues]{.underline}, in that [we have failed to put
sufficient resources into]{.underline}, for example, [anti-aging
research,]{.underline} and are morally blameworthy for this failure.
Likewise, [Hall\'s concerns can be framed as things that ought to be
done to people\'s bodies]{.underline}; to make sense of [the claim that
subjecting disabled people to]{.underline} additional [risk of medical
negligence is unjust]{.underline}, [we must accept that
some]{.underline} [bodily states are undesirable]{.underline}. [Even if
we reject]{.underline} the notion [that disability]{.underline} states
[are]{.underline} especially [risky]{.underline}, [except insofar as
social conditions make them so, we cannot make sense of the idea that it
is unjust to refuse a disabled person an organ transplant]{.underline},
to take one of Hall\'s examples, [without accepting that
the]{.underline} risk and [vulnerability from lacking a healthy
heart]{.underline} or kidney [ought to be avoided]{.underline}. In the
end, both [Hall and Bostrom are arguing that we have a **moral
obligation to change society so that there is wide access to medical
interventions**]{.underline} [that reduce risk of disease and
death,]{.underline} and so [a distinction between social and biological
risks cannot support Hall\'s position]{.underline}.

#### Ship of Theseus DA -- there's no brightline between positive and negative enhancements.

**Chaproniere 21** (Lysette Chaproniere, PhD student in philosophy at
the university of Glasgow, investigating the relationship between
disability and human enhancement. Bioethics, \"Is enhancement inherently
ableist?\", 12/18/2021, https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1111/bioe.12982, accessed

A second possible way of making the distinction comes from Hall\'s claim
that one of [the differences between the enhancements]{.underline} she
critiques, [and unproblematic enhancements]{.underline} accepted by
everyone, [is that the enhancements she critiques 'refuse the
body']{.underline}.1414 Ibid: 645. The other criteria she offers for
distinguishing between problematic and unproblematic enhancements are
that [the problematic ones 'draw together positive and negative
eugenics' or 'attempt to decide what sort of people there should
be']{.underline} (ibid: 645). [It would be hard to argue
that]{.underline} enhancements such as [life extension 'draw
together]{.underline} positive and negative [eugenics']{.underline} or
'attempt to decide what sort of people there should be' any more than do
the enhancements and treatments she accepts. Presumably, [she intends
these criteria]{.underline} primarily [to pick out enhancement via
genetic selection]{.underline}, such as in Savulescu\'s principle of
procreative beneficence. For that reason, I will not address them in
this section. But [what makes an enhancement a problematic refusal of
the body]{.underline}? [Does it]{.underline} simply [mean]{.underline}
doing away with or [transcending]{.underline} our [fleshly
bodies]{.underline}? If so, mind uploading scenarios would certainly
count. But [suppose]{.underline} that, instead of mind uploading, [I
gradually replace my body]{.underline} parts [with prosthetic
alternatives]{.underline}. **[At what point have I refused the
body]{.underline}**? [It would seem ableist to say that using a
prosthetic leg]{.underline} rather than one\'s natural leg [is a
problematic refusal of the limb]{.underline}. [But where]{.underline}
else [could the distinction be drawn]{.underline}? Ei[ther one has
refused the body at some point in]{.underline} the [gradual
replacement]{.underline} scenario, [or that scenario never counts as
refusal of the body]{.underline}, even when most or all of the flesh has
been replaced, [but mind uploading does]{.underline}. In either case,
[it is not clear what makes the relevant difference.]{.underline} It
must also be considered whether this criterion applies to other types of
enhancement. [If refusal of the body is supposed to be the
reason]{.underline} (or a reason) [why lifespan extension is
problematic, then the same reasoning would seem to apply to]{.underline}
ordinary, [uncontroversial enhancements and treatments]{.underline}.
**[Are vaccinations a refusal of the body since they make us less
vulnerable to disease]{.underline}**? Perhaps not, since [Hall puts gene
therapy to boost one\'s immune system on the unproblematic side of the
line]{.underline}.1515 Ibid: 645. But i[f there is a problem with
lifespan extension because it aims to avoid death, which is just part of
having a body, one could also argue that there is a problem with
vaccinations because they aim to avoid disease]{.underline}, which is
also just part of having a body. One could even argue that [vaccinations
reject the body with a weakened immune system]{.underline}. [Refusal of
the body,]{.underline} then, [does not provide a helpful criterion for
which enhancements are problematic]{.underline}.

Thirdly, it might be a matter of [degree]{.underline}; [the ways
disabled people are put at risk makes them too vulnerable,
but]{.underline} if [Bostr]{.underline}om\'s dream became a reality, we
[would not be vulnerable enough]{.underline}, and we should strive for
the optimal level of vulnerability. [But how do we decide what the
optimal level of vulnerability is]{.underline}? Setting [a non-arbitrary
threshold is]{.underline} often [difficult]{.underline}, but [it
is]{.underline} an even [greater]{.underline} challenge [for those who
reject]{.underline} the ideal of [normality]{.underline}, as both Hall
and I do, and as do many disability advocates. Some might argue, for
instance, that [we ought to give each person the opportunity to have a
normal lifespan]{.underline}. Providing [inadequate medical care to
disabled people denies them that opportunity]{.underline}, but the forms
of [life extension]{.underline} Bostrom promotes [take people beyond
normal]{.underline}, and so fall outside that obligation, and may be
unwise or even morally impermissible. But since [Hall would not want to
give]{.underline} [so much significance to normality]{.underline}, if
the distinction is meant to be a matter of degree, she would need to
find an alternative way of setting the threshold.

My argument in this section does not necessarily show that, if we accept
ordinary medical treatments, on pain of inconsistency we must also
accept radical enhancement. Instead, I am arguing for something more
specific: that the **[enhancements]{.underline}** Hall critiques
**[cannot be distinguished from medical interventions]{.underline}** of
the sort **[that almost everybody accepts]{.underline}** based on how
they treat our bodily vulnerability.

At first it might appear that those who are concerned with the problems
enhancement might cause for disabled people would be keen to emphasize
autonomy and individual liberties. [In a world where capacities can
easily be enhanced and bodies]{.underline} can easily be [modified, one
might worry about whether people who wish to remain disabled will be
free]{.underline} to not use these technologies. Hall would appear to
have this concern, arguing that '[physically disabled persons who wish
to revel in difference]{.underline} and explore the unique
functionalities, modes, and desires of their bodies [would not fit
Bostrom\'s schema for]{.underline} exploration of [human
potential']{.underline}.1616 Ibid: 637.

Several transhumanist thinkers have addressed this objection. Anders
Sandberg, for instance, defends a right to morphological freedom. He

technologies]{.underline}, it also [includes the right not to modify
oneself]{.underline}, and notes the uniqueness of those who resist
popular technologies. Moreover, he explicitly states that [some disabled
people do not wish to be cured of their disabilities]{.underline}, and

transhumanists and disability activists]{.underline}.1717 Sandberg, A.

must conform, [we should appreciate that '\[h\]umans differ
widely]{.underline} in their conceptions of what their own perfection or

leads to greater happiness and a better life, [strikes me
as]{.underline} the kind of claim that only a fairly
**[privileged]{.underline}** philosopher ([that is,]{.underline} likely
[a cis white man]{.underline}) could make. Or, at the very least, one
who does not actually know any women philosophers.2323 Clune-Taylor, C.

Paragraph 5, emphasis in Clune-Taylor.

Clune-Taylor is certainly correct to say that [having any]{.underline}
particular type or level of **[intellectual capacity is not a sufficient
condition for gaining]{.underline}** social
**[opportunities]{.underline}** such as becoming a professional
philosopher. [Many people with far less education and
privilege]{.underline} than even the most marginalized philosophers [are
unable to take full advantage of their intellectual]{.underline} and
other [capacities because of their social disadvantage]{.underline}. But
even if having some specific physical, cognitive, or other capacity is
not sufficient for having a given opportunity, it will sometimes be
necessary, or at least very helpful.

It should also be noted that [not all]{.underline} actual or proposed
hypothetical [enhancement]{.underline} technologies [would increase our
separateness and independence]{.underline}. As Hall herself notes, 'We
are many and porous, leaky and interactive'.2424 Hall, op. cit. note 4,
p. 644. If we especially value our leakiness and porousness, that might
be a reason to develop [technologies]{.underline} that [blur the
boundaries between persons, or]{.underline} more generally [make us less
separate from one another]{.underline}. Bostrom, for instance, explores
the prospect of making [telepathic communication]{.underline} possible
by augmenting our brains with radio transmitters.2525 Bostrom, op. cit.
note 6, p. 7. Earp, Sandberg and Savulescu argue for the use of 'love
drugs' to [enhance relationships]{.underline}.2626 Earp, B., Sandberg,
A., & Savulescu, J. (2012). Natural selection, childrearing, and the
ethics of marriage (and divorce): Building a case for the
neuroenhancement of human relationships. Philosophy and Technology,
25(4), 561--587. I do not intend to present these technologies as a
solution to the stigmatization of dependence and interdependence. I am
suggesting that some of the technologies discussed in the enhancement
literature would make us less separate rather than more self-sufficient,
and so the proponent of enhancement needn\'t endorse an atomistic
conception of the self on which separateness is desirable.

### 2AC -- Alt Fails

#### The problem is society, not the tech -- either the perm solves or the alt fails

**Chaproniere 21** (Lysette Chaproniere, PhD student in philosophy at
the university of Glasgow, investigating the relationship between
disability and human enhancement. Bioethics, \"Is enhancement inherently
ableist?\", 12/18/2021, https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1111/bioe.12982, accessed

Thus far, I have primarily been considering whether there is something
ableist about the values of transhumanists and other enhancement
advocates. I now turn to a different sort of disability-related
objection to enhancement: that it will have bad consequences for
disabled people.

To help us understand the objection, I will draw on Elizabeth Barnes\'s
discussion of disability cures. [Why is it]{.underline}, Barnes asks,
that [if a scientist is developing a cure for a disability, we think she
is doing something good]{.underline} and hope she succeeds, [but if a
scientist is developing a 'cure' for being gay, we think she\'s doing
something horrible]{.underline} and hope she fails? Barnes\'s answer to
her own question is that [these]{.underline} two [cases]{.underline}
**[may not be]{.underline}** all that **[different]{.underline}**. It\'s
not that there\'s anything inherently wrong with a drug or other
treatment that could change people\'s sexual orientation. In fact, [it
would be good if people could]{.underline} freely [modify their sexual
orientation as they saw fit]{.underline}. It\'s just that, [since we
live in a homophobic society]{.underline}, [we expect the availability
of such a treatment to have negative consequences]{.underline}. [Gay
people would be coerced]{.underline} or pressured [into taking the
treatment]{.underline}, or so the thought goes, and there would be less
acceptance of those who would prefer to remain gay. Likewise, [there\'s
**nothing inherently wrong with developing methods for making disabled
people non-disabled.**]{.underline} In fact, [since bodily autonomy is a
positive]{.underline}, [it\'s a good thing if disabled people who would
prefer not to be disabled have the option of removing their
disability]{.underline}. As with being gay, however, [we might worry
that the existence of such technologies would lead to less acceptance of
people who would prefer to remain disabled]{.underline}. And, just as
most of us would think it inappropriate to talk of a 'cure' for being
gay, [many disability activists object to the language of 'cure' for
disability]{.underline}, even if making it possible for disabled people
to become non-disabled is not objectionable per se.5151 Barnes, op. cit.
note 36, pp. 162--166.

Now let us extend Barnes\'s analysis to enhancement. [Some]{.underline}
people [wish to extend their capacities]{.underline}, or otherwise
modify themselves, and [from the perspective of bodily autonomy and
cognitive liberty, it is good if they can freely do so.]{.underline}
This seems like a strong reason in favour of making enhancements
available. Yet even if those reasons are accepted, [we might worry
about]{.underline} the negative consequences of enhancement within
current [social contexts. Will people be pressured]{.underline} into
using enhancements in ways that reinforce oppressive social norms? [Will
we really have more freedom]{.underline} over our own bodies and minds?
Do these potential negative consequences outweigh the positives?

[Those]{.underline} who accept this way of thinking [may be tempted by
the following]{.underline} line of thought. [Enhancement is a good thing
in the abstract, but not in the oppressive societies that exist
now]{.underline}. Therefore, [until we have created a less oppressive,
more equal society, enhancement should be banned]{.underline}, or
strongly discouraged. **[This will not work,]{.underline}** however.
[Enhancement is not]{.underline} a [well-defined]{.underline} category,
so proposing [to ban enhancements]{.underline}, even temporarily,
[immediately raises the question of which]{.underline} specific
[technologies or practices ought to be banned. Enhancement
technologies]{.underline} also [have treatment uses]{.underline}, so [it
would have to be the enhancement uses]{.underline} of the technologies,
[rather than the technologies]{.underline} themselves, [that were
banned]{.underline}. Even if some interventions typically classified as
treatments, such as [removing]{.underline} particular
[disabilities]{.underline}, [also ought to be banned]{.underline},
presumably some [treatments]{.underline} [would still be]{.underline}
morally [permissible]{.underline}, even required, so [we
would]{.underline} still [need a principled way of making the
distinction between permissible and impermissible
interventions]{.underline}. [Determining what goes either side of that
line]{.underline} can itself [cause problems]{.underline}, as ever more
[disorders are invented so that desired medical interventions can be put
on the treatment side of the line.]{.underline}

Furthermore, the thought [that enhancement should be banned]{.underline}
until we have created a less oppressive society [assumes that
enhancements are]{.underline} something of a [luxury]{.underline}. Many
transhumanists would disagree with this, since they would argue that
developing enhancements is a moral obligation. Bostrom, for instance,
would have you reflect on how many people have died since you started
reading this paper,5252 As he does in his TED talk (TED, op. cit. note
30). and urge us to put our resources into researching ways to delay or
eliminate aging. According to him, research into lifespan extension is
not merely something that would be nice to do, when we get around to it.
[All the time we delay it, **people are dying**]{.underline}.5353
Bostrom, op. cit. note 5. Persson and Savulescu would argue that [we
cannot create a sufficiently moral society quickly enough]{.underline}
using only familiar methods of social reform, and that [these must be
**supplemented by moral enhancement**]{.underline}.5454 Persson &
Savulescu (2012), op. cit. note 45. If they are right, perhaps [we
**cannot end oppression**]{.underline}, or end it quickly enough,
**[without using]{.underline}** moral **[enhancements]{.underline}**
[that would make us less prejudiced]{.underline}. Such claims would have
to be evaluated before enhancement could be banned. Even if these
arguments are rejected, [there is an additional reason for not
conceiving of enhancements as luxuries,]{.underline} which has to do
with [our limited ability to know what it is like to inhabit another
person\'s body]{.underline}.

#### Any alternative that rejects the technology links back

[To]{.underline} some [cis people]{.underline}, the [hormonal treatments
and gender confirmation surgeries]{.underline} opted for by many trans
people may [seem frivolous]{.underline}. [Why]{.underline}, they might
ask, [would anybody want to modify a healthy body]{.underline}? Such
[people are not]{.underline} [taking into account]{.underline} the
distress of [gender dysphoria]{.underline}, or the benefits to
well-being that can come from modifying one\'s body to more closely
align with one\'s gender. That is not to say that trans healthcare
should necessarily be placed in the enhancement category. [Those who
would advocate for banning enhancement]{.underline}, at least
temporarily, [might say that]{.underline}, in the interest of trans
rights, [trans healthcare should be permitted]{.underline}. But [if we
can be so wrong about the body modifications required by many trans
people, in what other ways could we be wrong about people\'s desires for
their own bodies?]{.underline}

This idea should be familiar to disability activists; as discussed in
Section 5, many [disabled people say they enjoy high quality of life,
and these claims are surprising to the non-disabled majority, who often
disbelieve them. As with the desires of trans people]{.underline}, this
is a case where [the majority is wrong]{.underline} about what it is
like to have a certain sort of body. [Even if disability sometimes does
lower quality of life, it is not the inevitable tragedy]{.underline} so
often depicted.

[Since we can so easily be wrong about what people require to live
comfortably in their bodies, a blanket ban or social censure of
enhancement may do **more harm than good.**]{.underline} [Denying people
body modifications can do great harm, even where that denial stems from
a desire to prevent people from buying into oppressive
norms]{.underline}. With respect to trans healthcare,
[consider]{.underline} the harms done by [the idea that the desires of
trans men for surgery]{.underline} and other aspects of transition [are
the result of internalized misogyny]{.underline}, the way [that trans
people]{.underline} of all genders [are expected to be absolutely
sure]{.underline} before being accepted for medical care5555 Lester, C.
N. (2017). Trans like me: A journey for all of us. Virago, ch. 4. and
the stressfulness and invasiveness of medical gatekeeping.5656 Pearce,
R. (2018). Understanding trans health: Discourse, power and possibility.
Policy Press, pp. 136--139. As Jamison Green suggests, 'The theory [that
if trans people had some other culturally constructed
option]{.underline}, a place to be socially male (or female) while
remaining physically female (or male), then [we would categorically
refuse body altering technology]{.underline} is pure utopian
conjecture'.5757 Green, J. (2020). Becoming a visible man (2nd ed.).
Vanderbilt University Press, p. 191. Similarly, [Kim Hall criticizes
'the assumption that the body with which one is born is unambiguously
one\'s own and that oppression is the only thing that prohibits this
realization']{.underline}.5858 Hall, K. Q. (2009). Queer breasted
experience. In L. Shrage (Ed.), You\'ve changed: Sex reassignment and
personal identity (pp. 121--134). Oxford University Press, p. 122. Just
a[s we cannot assume that trans people would no longer want to alter
their bodies in a society without restrictive gender roles, we cannot
assume that people would no longer want to become non-disabled, or
enhance their capacities, in a world without ableism and other
oppression]{.underline}. [Nor can we assume that]{.underline} these
[body modifications are frivolous]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} nice to
have but [inessential]{.underline} to the well-being of those who desire
them, and that their development and use can therefore be delayed until
we have achieved significant social reform. It is true that [oppressive
norms can distort people\'s desires]{.underline} about their own bodies,
[but insisting that all such desires are so distorted risks
**dismissing** other kinds of **oppression**]{.underline} and suffering.
Social justice movements are better served by accepting that [people
have different desires and needs]{.underline} for how their bodies or
minds should be, [whether]{.underline} that is [trans people needing
hormones and/or surgery, people wanting to remain or even become
disabled, disabled people wanting to remove their disability, or people
wanting to enhance their capacities beyond what we currently consider
the norm]{.underline}.5959 On people wanting to become disabled, see

The influence of CDS and its challenge to the assumption that disability
is a uniform condition have enabled the emergence of new ideas on
disability. In particular, this has enabled the development of a theory
that can take account of not only impairment effects but also can
include class, ethnicity, sexual orientation or cultural identities. It
has also argued for the re-emergence of a new political identity, one
where a solidarity that was previously built on a common single identity
is replaced by one that incorporates multiple voices including
representatives from across the range of constituencies. The politics
that it seeks to develop will be the ending of the single interest group
identity of the disability movement to be replaced by single-issue
groups campaigning for different social issues. To paraphrase Lister
(1998, 74), [if disability and impairment are simply to be
'deconstructed into a kaleidoscope of shifting identities' and ableist
discourses, there will be no disabled people left to either fight for
the right to be, or to be a citizen.]{.underline} If the principles of
[CDS]{.underline} are evaluated critically in the light of disadvantage,
it[s analytical and political value becomes questionable]{.underline}.
[Its relativism and its suggestions that impairments are]{.underline}
ethically and politically merely [neutral differences are
**false**]{.underline}. [Impairments]{.underline} often **[have very
tangible effects]{.underline}** [on people's well-being,]{.underline}
many of [which cannot be explained away by deconstruction]{.underline}
(for example, Shakespeare 2006; Thomas 1999). [Recognizing impairment
effects is necessary]{.underline} in order [to secure]{.underline}
proper [treatment and social arrangements]{.underline} that enhance
disabled people's well-being and social participation. [CDS runs the
risk of dismissing]{.underline} not only [the personal experiences of
living with impairment]{.underline}, [but also the significance of the
differences between socially created disadvantages]{.underline}. These
disadvantages that often result from oppressive social arrangements, are
very much real and take place in different ways for different
disadvantaged groups. 646 S. Vehmas and N. Watson

[Disabled people typically experience disadvantage in relation to the
market and capitalism, and]{.underline} they [have]{.underline} to a
large extent [been excluded from employment and from equal social
participation, respect and wealth]{.underline} (Wolff and De-Shalit
2007, 26). On top of these materialist disadvantages, [disabled people
are stigmatized as deviant and undesirable]{.underline}, and also
[subordinated to various oppressive hierarchical relations]{.underline}.
For [disabled people]{.underline} to achieve participatory parity, they
require more than recognition; they [need **material
help**]{.underline}, targeted **[resource enhancement]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[personal enhancement]{.underline}** (Wolff and
De-Shalit 2007). [Disability is rooted in the economic structures of
society and demands redistribution of goods and wealth.]{.underline} In
contrast to some other oppressed groups, [disabled people require more
than the removal of barriers]{.underline} if they are to achieve social
justice. This extra help might be small -- for example, [allowing a
student with dyslexia extra time in an examination]{.underline} --
through to complex interventions such as [facilitated
communication]{.underline}, a [job support]{.underline} worker
[or]{.underline} 24-hour [personal assistance]{.underline}. Whatever the
size, [it is an extra cost both to employers and to the state. These are
real needs and represent real differences.]{.underline} Without an
acceptance of these differences it is hard to see how we could move
forward. Whilst these 'real differences' can be presented as the result
of dominant ableist discourses where disabled people's needs are
regarded as extra cost, this does not solve the problem. [The problems
disabled people face require more than ideological change]{.underline},
and **[ideological change is of little use if it does not result in
material change]{.underline}**. CDS fails to account for the economic
basis of disability and offers only the tools of deconstruction and the
abolishment of cultural hierarchies to eradicate economic injustice.
This, as Fraser (2000) has argued, would be possible in a society where
there were no relatively autonomous markets and the distribution of
goods were regulated through cultural values. In such a society,
oppression based on identity would translate perfectly into economic
injustice and maldistribution. This is far from the current reality
where 'marketization has pervaded all societies to some degree, at least
partially decoupling economic mechanisms of distribution from cultural
patterns of value and prestige' (Fraser 2000, 111). Markets are not
controlled by nor are they subsidiary to culture; 'as a result they
generate economic inequalities that are not mere expressions of identity
hierarchies' (Fraser 2000, 111--112). [The disadvantage related to
disability is to a great extent a matter of economic
injustice]{.underline}, and [before this injustice can be corrected we
have to]{.underline} be able to ide[ntify those individuals and social
groups that have been disadvantaged by social arrangements]{.underline}.
[Whilst this does create]{.underline} and foster [categories and
binaries]{.underline} between groups of people, [it]{.underline} also
[requires]{.underline} some sort of [categories to start
with]{.underline}; namely, [the various categories of
disadvantage]{.underline}. Both the social and physical mechanisms that
produce human diversity are real, and they produce tangible differences
that cannot be challenged, let alone abolished, merely by pointing out
the wanton nature of difference, and deconstructing the meanings
attached to disability. [Changing the social conditions that
disadvantage and disable some people demands that the diverse, sometimes
dualistic, reality of social advantage and disadvantage between
different groups of people is recognized]{.underline}. This is exactly
why group identities based on, for example, impairment, gender, or
sexuality have been invaluable tools in the resistance against
discrimination and oppression -- in the fight against socially produced
disadvantage. [Confident, positive disability identity has enabled many
disabled people to actively challenge the status quo that disadvantages
them and to claim rights and power and participation in dominant
institutions. Being different from the so-called normal majority is no
longer]{.underline} Disability & Society 647 [considered to conflict
with a good life, equality and respect]{.underline}. Quite the opposite,
[positive realization of one's difference has been liberating and
empowering to many disabled people]{.underline} (Shakespeare 2006;
Morris 1991). [For a radical and active disability movement to emerge
and for disabled people to take action on their own account, they have
to see themselves as an unfairly marginalized or disadvantaged
constituency and a minority **group**]{.underline} (Shakespeare and
Watson 2001). [The category disabled/ non-disabled is a good abstraction
that can enable the development of communities of
resistance]{.underline}, and without it is hard to see how these could
develop. CDS is premised on the idea that difference acts as a precursor
to the normalizing of behaviour and a requirement to treat people
differently and, importantly, less favourably. [There is]{.underline},
however, [no evidence to suggest that]{.underline} the
[categories]{.underline} that are applied to disabled people [create an
unnecessary divide]{.underline} between disabled and nondisabled people.
You could equally make the point that [without]{.underline} these
[categories we would not know what it is we have to do,]{.underline}
what actions we have to take or what services we have to put in place to
include disabled people. Indeed, for many disabled people the
[disadvantages]{.underline} they are subjected to [arise]{.underline}
not as the result of domination but [through neglect and the denial of
services]{.underline} and thro[ugh society failing to take
responsibility for those in need]{.underline}. As Wolff (2009, 114)
points out: '[anti-discrimination policy needs to identify a group to be
protected]{.underline}.' In other words, [it is impossible to fight the
oppression of a group of people that does not exist.]{.underline}
[Recognition of impairment is also crucial regarding legislation and
policy that aim to protect disabled people against
discrimination.]{.underline} The point of anti-discrimination
legislation is to protect people from discrimination on the basis of
their physical and mental properties, not on their opportunity to
achieve equal participation and respect. Thus, 'the parallel to race and
gender is not disability but impairment' (Wolff 2009, 135).

#### The alt can't change society's worldview and marginalizes material experiences -- the choice to enhance or not is valid, but refusing solutions for real anguish is totalizing and nonsensical

[The disability movement]{.underline}, like other emancipatory
movements, [is based on a positive sense of a group
difference]{.underline}, and whilst the [CDS]{.underline} perspective
does not deny the reality of social groups such as disabled people, it
[asserts that such social group differences are undesirable
and]{.underline} potentially [harmful]{.underline}. We argue that this
normative thinking is not fruitful because [a society without group
differences is not a realistic possibility]{.underline}; [CDS is neither
able to articulate or to even theorize how such a society would
exist]{.underline}. For CDS to be successful [one has to accept the
idea]{.underline} not only [that the disabled/non-disabled binary does
not exist but also that]{.underline} such a [binary is neither
desirable, ethically justifiable or useful.]{.underline} Further,
[deconstructing differences will not]{.underline} in and of itself
[produce respect and equality between all people]{.underline} with
various characteristics. [Neither will it result in a social order free
from]{.underline} a sense of [difference]{.underline}. [It
is]{.underline} simply **[unrenalistic]{.underline}** to assume
[that]{.underline} a society could exist were [people would not see some
other people as different]{.underline}, and their lives or
characteristics as representing a deviation from some norm considered
important regarding good human life. This is because [some of the
individual characteristics that define disabled people are]{.underline},
sometimes with good reason, [undesirable]{.underline}, [even in a
utopia]{.underline} where all differences would have been queered.
[Disability is not the same as]{.underline} many [other group
identities]{.underline} and we need to explore both morally and socially
disability and difference rather than simply use difference as a concept
through which to critique the disability identity. [There are no
rational reasons to consider homosexuality or gender
undesirable]{.underline} characteristics whatever the social 648 S.
Vehmas and N. Watson context, [but there are many impairments that can
reasonably be seen as undesirable]{.underline} (Shakespeare 2006).
[Motor neuron disease, depression or spinal cord injury]{.underline} are
the kinds of conditions that [we would prefer not to have]{.underline},
and this is [not merely because of the cultural
representations]{.underline} attached to them [but because these
**conditions**]{.underline} are the kinds of predicaments that **[cause
suffering]{.underline}** irrespective of one's cultural environment. [In
acknowledging that impairments can include an undesirable dimension does
not imply devaluing people with impairments]{.underline} nor their
positive group identity (Shakespeare and Watson 2010). [As long as
people are genuinely free to decide for themselves]{.underline} and feel
about themselves however they wish to feel, [we are]{.underline} pretty
[close to relational justice, free from hierarchical evils]{.underline}.
[Imposing]{.underline} on people [ableist or disablist assumptions
is]{.underline} certainly [wrong, but so would be the denial of the
personal experiences of fearing the loss of one's physical and mental
capacities, or the fear of dying]{.underline} (Carel 2008**).** [To
explain the **psychological anguish** related to]{.underline} conditions
such as [motor neurone disease or depression]{.underline} [merely in
terms of internalized oppression and ableism would be **insensitive,
disrespectful and simply nonsensical**]{.underline}. We have argued that
[CDS and its principles]{.underline} of deconstructing differences [are
ethically and politically unhelpful]{.underline}. [CDS]{.underline}
[fails to offer guidance on how to solve moral dilemmas and]{.underline}
on how to [distribute goods in society fairly]{.underline}. Matters of
distribution and [relations between people are inescapable]{.underline}
in making a just society, and exactly the kinds of issues [any truly
critical theory of disability must seriously engage with]{.underline},

[One of the greatest philosophers of the 20th century was a
Nazi.]{.underline} There is no disputing this stark fact: Few people
would argue Martin Heidegger's claim to preeminence, and his Nazism, at
least at first, was public and enthusiastic. In the spring of 1933, a
few months after Hitler took power, Heidegger joined the Nazi Party and
was elected rector of Freiburg University, where his expressed goal was
Gleichschaltung---the "alignment" of the academy with the new
party-state. [At his inaugural ceremony, the audience gave the Hitler
salute and sang the Horst Wessel Song, the anthem of the Nazi
party]{.underline}, before Heidegger spoke about "the glory and
greatness of this new beginning." [Just what was involved in the "glory
and greatness" of National Socialism was already on full
display:]{.underline} Dachau opened in March, Jewish businesses were
boycotted in April, and [Heidegger was sworn in as rector in May. He
lasted only a year before he was outpoliticked by cruder and more
aggressive Nazi academics]{.underline}, and for the rest of the Third
Reich he made no overt political statements. Yet [Heidegger never
publicly apologized for his early endorsement and service of Hitler, nor
fully reckoned with what his Nazism meant for his legacy as a
thinker.]{.underline} Yet for some reason among philosophers and
intellectuals **[there seems to be perpetual amnesia about this
subject.]{.underline}** Heidegger's Nazism was common knowledge to
anyone who lived through the 1930s. After World War II, [he was banned
from teaching by the Allied occupation authorities because of his Nazi
allegiances. But when biographers]{.underline} Victor Farias and Hugo
Ott wrote ab[out Heidegger's political involvement in the 1980s, the
world of thought, especially in Germany and France, greeted it as an
explosive new discovery. The same thing happened in 2005,]{.underline}
when Emmanuel Faye unearthed Heidegger's course lectures from 1933-35
and showed that he had, in Faye's terms, accomplished "the introduction
of Nazism into philosophy." And in 2014, the scandal erupted once again,
with the publication of Heidegger's "Black Notebooks" from the 1930s,
the private journals in which he sketched his thoughts on philosophy,
current events, and the connection between the two. Now the "Black
Notebooks"---a sinister-sounding name for what were, in fact, just black
notebooks---are beginning to appear in English translation, allowing
Americans to join in the latest round of the controversy. The first
volume, Ponderings II-VI: Black Notebooks 1931-38 has just been
published; a companion volume, Reading Heidegger's Black Notebooks
1931-41, contains essays on the texts, in which various experts argue
about how far they implicate Heidegger in Nazism and anti-Semitism. [Why
is this 80-year-old story still able to shock?]{.underline} The reason
must be that, [no matter how much we find out about Heidegger's Nazism,
it still seems like a contradiction in terms. After all, we think we
know what Nazis are like and what philosophers are like, and the two
identities simply don't match. Thinkers are supposed to be idealistic,
moral defenders]{.underline} of the highest values of civilization;
fascists are brutal, barbaric, appealing to humanity's lowest instincts.
[Nazis burn books; philosophers write them. But **Heidegger did
both.**]{.underline} In 1927, [he published one of the most influential
books in the history of philosophy]{.underline}, Being and Time; [six
years later,]{.underline} as rector of Freiburg University, [he presided
over a public bonfire of "un-German" books, proclaiming, "Flame,
announce to us, light up for us, show us the path from which there is no
turning back."]{.underline} Like the famous optical illusion in which
the same figure is both a duck and a rabbit, then, [we keep twisting and
turning our image of Heidegger, trying to see in him both the Nazi and
the philosopher at the same time]{.underline}. \*\*\* I am not sure how
much I knew about Martin Heidegger's story when I first read Being and
Time, his magnum opus. I'm pretty sure that I knew he had been, at least
temporarily, a Nazi; but oddly, as it now seems to me, this had no
effect on my enthusiasm for the book. Certainly, it never occurred to me
that, as a Jew, I should shun or distrust this great thinker who had
given his allegiance to Adolf Hitler. I think my 21-year-old self was
right not to be frightened off by this fact. After all, I had just
finished four years of studying the classics of English literature, many
of which are far more overtly hostile to Jews than anything Heidegger
ever wrote. Reading Chaucer's heart-rending portrait of a child ritually
murdered by Jews in The Pardoner's Tale, or T.S. Eliot's dark mutterings
about the jew (lower case) squatting on a windowsill in "Gerontion," I
was not too offended or dismayed to enjoy the poems. That is because I
knew they were not talking about me, an actual Jew, who understood and
appreciated them so well. They were addressing Jews of their
imagination---malign fictions that no longer seemed to have any power,
certainly not in the America where I grew up. Like any Jew in Western
civilization, I knew instinctively how to peel apart the ignorance and
hatred from the sweetness and the light. But [with Heidegger, sweetness
and light were never part of the package, and that was the key to his
power.]{.underline} Being and Time was the first book of philosophy I
had read that seemed to understand the human condition in the same way
that literature did---less through abstract intellectual concepts than
through the lived experience of mood. For Heidegger, existence---in
German, Dasein---is grasped first and foremost not by the rational mind,
but by the emotions that determine the very shape and texture of the
world in which we live. The affects he dwells on are primarily
"negative" ones---fear, alienation, anxiety, rather than love or
joy---but he argues that these dark and disorienting moods are precisely
what disclose the world to us most primally. [As he writes in Being and
Time]{.underline} (as translated by John Macquarrie and Edward
Robinson): [A state-of-mind not only discloses Dasein in its thrownness
and its submission to that world which is already disclosed within its
own Being]{.underline}; it is itself the existential kind of Being in
which [Dasein constantly surrenders itself to the "world" and lets the
"world" "matter" to it in such a way that somehow Dasein evades its very
self.]{.underline} The [highly specialized terminology]{.underline} here
might function as an obstacle to understanding at first, but it [is an
integral part of Heidegger's literary effect.]{.underline} By coining
new, technical terms like "thrownness" (Geworfenheit), and by referring
to the human being not as a person or even a "subject" but as
Dasein---literally, in German, "being-there"---Heidegger refreshes the
reader's perception of existence in the same way that poetry does. For a
human being, he emphasizes, existence means being "thrown" into a world
not of our making, a world whose basic facts are care and death. Most of
the time, we soothe ourselves by avoiding these facts, "surrendering ...
to the world" rather than confronting it. We see ourselves from the
outside rather than owning our fate, allowing the chatter of "the They"
(das Man) to fill our minds. It is only when we are anxious that our
customary thoughtlessness recedes and we are able to see that world in
its true alienness. In this way, Heidegger's existentialism, his method
of understanding the world not through concepts but through the lived
experience of existence, leads to a particular ethical stance. Being and
Time is not an overtly ethical book---it has nothing to say in the
traditional vocabulary of Western philosophical moralism, no use for
ideas like Plato's "the Good" or Kant's categorical imperative. That is
largely because Heidegger is not very interested in the central problem
of ethics (and of politics), which is how to live with other people. For
him, the key experiences and challenges of existence are individual:
Alone we suffer, alone we die, and alone we must make meaning out of our
fate. The highest value, then, is not goodness but authenticity; above
all, authenticity in the face of death. To accept one's actual condition
of mortality and thrownness, not to flee from these difficult facts into
consoling illusions and abstractions, is for Heidegger the ultimate
moral achievement. As he writes, "Authentic Being-towards-death can not
evade its ownmost non-relational possibility, or cover up this
possibility by fleeing from it, or give a new explanation for it to
accord with the common sense of 'the they.' " What [Heidegger does here
is to pluck a kind of meaning from the midst of nihilism.]{.underline}
It is precisely because life is meaningless, [because it has no value or
purpose imposed on it from above or outside, that the individual human
being must endow it with meaning]{.underline} by deciding on an
authentic existence. [But authenticity and decision are fundamentally
anti-ethical concepts]{.underline}, because they deny the existence of
any established values, such as justice, equality, or sympathy. [Why be
a "good" person rather than a "bad" person, if terms like good and bad
are mere conventions? If life has the meaning we decide to give it,
**what's to stop us from finding that meaning in arbitrary violence,
domination, or irrationality?**]{.underline} What if we choose to find
meaning in serving a Volk or a Führer? Of course, [Heidegger's thought
does not lead directly to fascism.]{.underline} On the contrary, his
most important readers were French existentialists like Sartre and
Camus, who believed the ideal of freedom called for commitment to the
anti-Nazi resistance. [But in an important sense, **Heidegger leaves the
door open for fascism**, because he values the intensity and
authenticity of a belief over its goodness or truthfulness.]{.underline}
In a world defined by nihilism, any source of strong new beliefs and
convictions is potentially redemptive. That is why, [in the early days
of the Hitler dictatorship, Heidegger could take the new Nazi regime as
a potential source of new values---]{.underline}an assertion of will
that would create an entirely new spiritual and philosophical world.
[This hope is expressed again and again in the "Black
Notebooks"]{.underline} for 1933, the year Hitler took power and
Heidegger became rector of his university[. "A marvelously awakening
communal will is penetrating the great darkness of the world," Heidegger
writes. Nazism]{.underline}, with its rhetoric of destiny and rebirth,
[was going to define new coordinates for human life, **simply by the
authenticity and confidence of its self-assertion.**]{.underline} These
coordinates might be upside-down, from the perspective of conventional
morality; [Nazism might call murder, conquest, racism and dictatorship
good, where the old Judeo-Christian morality thought them bad. But
because values are determined by conviction]{.underline}, not vice
versa, [the Nazis could succeed in bringing into being a new world in
which evil actually was good.]{.underline} "The mission---if precisely
this were the mission: the full imposing and first proposing of the new
essence of truth?" Heidegger asks, thrilled at the prospect that truth
itself can be transformed. [A central part of the new Nazi "essence of
truth," of course, was anti-Semitism. When the accounts of Heidegger's
Nazism are drawn up, it has usually been counted in his favor that he
was not a racist anti-Semite]{.underline}, as though this demonstrated
the refinement of his own version of Nazism. In the 1994 biography
Martin Heiddegger by Rudiger Safranski, one chapter is titled "Is
Heidegger Anti-Semitic?" and the answer is a reassuring no: "Certainly
not in the sense of the ideological lunacy of Nazism. It is significant
that neither in his lectures and philosophical writings, nor in his
political speeches and pamphlets are there any anti-Semitic or racist
remarks." Indeed, Heidegger was very close to Jews in the first part of
his life, including his most important teacher, Edmund Husserl, and his
greatest student, Hannah Arendt. [Yet the attempt to construct firewalls
around Heidegger's Nazism]{.underline}, to save areas of his reputation
from its taint, [has suffered one failure after another, and **this one
too must fall.**]{.underline} It used to be argued that Heidegger was an
unworldly man who briefly blundered into Nazism; this was the
exculpatory argument made by Arendt in a radio address broadcast in
Germany on his 8oth birthday. This [account became unsustainable after
the research]{.underline} of Farias and Ott demonstrated the depths of
Heidegger's involvement with Nazism, [**including his carrying out of
the law that purged Jews from university teaching.**]{.underline} Then
Heidegger's defenders tried to distinguish between his political
activity, which may have been culpable, and his thought, which remained
untainted. But [Faye proved beyond a doubt that, in the first years of
Hitler's rule, Heidegger taught seminars in which he gave his most
famous philosophical concepts and terms an explicitly Nazi
resonance.]{.underline} Now [the publication of the "Black Notebooks"
has given the lie to the idea that Heidegger was not really
anti-Semitic.]{.underline} It is true that his anti-Semitism was not
biological, in the classic Nazi fashion. This was one of the crude
aspects of National Socialism from which he kept a deliberate distance.
"[The question of the role of World Jewry is not racial; it is, rather,
the metaphysical question of the nature of a type of humanity, the
absolutely unbound, that can assume the world-historical 'task' of
uprooting all beings from Being,"]{.underline} runs one of Heidegger's
dozen or so remarks about Jews. [But this is hardly
exculpatory]{.underline}. On the contrary, [it is especially damning
because it brings anti-Semitism into the central precincts of his
thought. For Heidegger, the "uprooting of beings from Being" was the
metaphysical curse of the modern world, the source of the nihilism that
afflicted humanity.]{.underline} Where the ancient Greeks enjoyed a
holistic and organic relationship with Being---which for Heidegger is
close to, but not quite identical with, what earlier Romantic thinkers
meant by Nature---modern philosophy and technology set the individual at
odds with Being. Instead of the miraculous background of human
existence, [Being is reduced to a series of objects that can be
mathematically calculated and industrially exploited.]{.underline} These
themes dominate Heidegger's later thought, where he condemns the way of
thinking he calls "enframing" (Gestell) and calls humanity to its true
role as the "shepherd of Being." And who is responsible for this modern
curse? [In his published work,]{.underline} Heidegger [traces it all the
way back to Plato and Aristotle, suggesting that it was the fate of
Western civilization to turn against itself in this way.]{.underline}
But **[in the "Black Notebooks," he finds a much simpler and more
familiar scapegoat: the Jews.]{.underline}** "World Jewry,"
Weltjudentum, with its overtones of hostile conspiracy, was a common
Nazi phrase that the philosopher had no qualms about embracing, using it
several times in the privacy of the notebooks. Thus [in 1941 Heidegger
writes: "World Jewry]{.underline}, spurred on by the emigrant that
Germany let out, remains elusive everywhere. Despite its increased
display of power, it [never has to take part in the practice of war,
whereas we are reduced to sacrificing the best blood of the best of our
own people." This is a breathtaking example of how Nazi anti-Semitism
precisely inverted reality]{.underline}: **[At just the moment when the
Holocaust was killing millions of helpless Jews, Heidegger suggests that
it was "elusive" World Jewry that was killing Germans.]{.underline}**
Several of the contributors to Reading Heidegger's Black Notebooks are
not deterred even by the latest revelations of Heidegger's deep
involvement with Nazism and anti-Semitism. "That Heidegger was a Nazi
and that he also held anti-Semitic views are simple facts---but they are
just that, and as facts, they are all too simple," writes Jeff Malpas.
[Heidegger is a writer who cultivates a mystique of
complexity]{.underline}; this is part of what attracted me to him
because it makes reading him feel like an arduous quest that promises
high rewards. And it is quite true that with such a subtle and profound
thinker, [Nazism and anti-Semitism will take subtle and "profound"
forms. But this does not mean that our judgment on them is not, in the
end, simple. The most important thing we have to learn from Heidegger
today is **how the allure of profundity and authenticity can lead to the
destruction of ethics and of thought itself.**]{.underline} [Heidegger's
Nazism does not mean that we should stop thinking about him; on the
contrary, it is all the more urgent to think about him, **so that we can
learn how to think against him.**]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Technopessimism Wrong

#### Heidegger was [wrong]{.underline} -- the technofication of humankind is in progress, [inevitable]{.underline} and [inconsequential]{.underline}. 

**Bailey 14** ("Enframing the Flesh: Heidegger, Transhumanism, and the
Body as "Standing Reserve"", July 2014,

Brad Allenby and Daniel Sarewitz, in their book The Techno-Human
Condition, and Andy Clark, in Natural-born Cyborgs: Minds, Technologies,
and the Future of Human Intelligence, argue persuasively that [we have,
in Clark's phrase, "**always been cyborgs**."]{.underline} Allenby and
Sarewitz argue that [technology is not something "new" that is present
only in power plants]{.underline} or coal mines but absent in windmills
or farming; for them, [the human condition is, and always has been, what
they call "The Techno-Human Condition." We are all already "enhanced,"
and "]{.underline}some would say [transhuman]{.underline}" (Allenby and
Sarewitz 2011, 2). They argue that [some have made the distinction
between "inner" and "outer" transformation of the body]{.underline} --
[e.g. the difference between wearing eyeglasses to enhance vision, and
some sort of HGE or "artificial body parts" that ensure perfect
vision.]{.underline} But, they ask: "is anything new really going on?"
They, of course, answer in the negative. For Allenby and Sarewitz, [the
technological modification of the body is simply "fulfilling our
biology."]{.underline} The fact that we ["never forget how to ride a
bicycle, or how to read, shows that allegedly external technologies do
in fact have an enhancing effect on our internal
capabilities"]{.underline} (2011, 15). [There would]{.underline} thus
[be no substantial difference between writing down facts we want to
remember]{.underline}, or using Google to "enhance" our memory, [or
having a microchip implanted in the brain which has access to data that
we can consciously and immediately control. "]{.underline}The history of
our species is a history of redesigning ourselves, of fuzzing the
boundaries between our inner and outer worlds" (2011, 16). So, they
argue, it "isn't clear to" them that HGE is "crossing some domain that
humans have never entered before, a domain that demands a new kind of
debate or raises new moral considerations and dilemmas" (2011, 17). We
will see that [Heidegger might agree, to some limited extent, with this
assessment]{.underline}: While enframing is certainly not "fulfilling
our biology," [it is true that the troubling alteration of human thought
began long before HGE became a foreseeable possibility.]{.underline}
Drawing on what has come to be called the "extended mind hypothesis,"
Andy [Clark argues that as soon as humans began writing we began
incorporating technologies into our consciousness]{.underline} (2004,
6). For Clark, [this process is nothing new, and nothing to be
feared.]{.underline} This is not to say, however, that he does not
recognize how emerging technologies will increase exponentially the ways
that human beings will become cyborgs: New waves of user-sensitive
technologies will bring the age-old process of cyborgization to a
climax, as our minds and identities become ever more deeply enmeshed in
a nonbiological matrix of machines, tools, props, codes, and
semi-intelligent daily objects. [We humans have always been adept at
dovetailing our minds and skills to the shape of our current tools and
aids. But when those tools and aids start dovetailing back -- when our
technologies actively, automatically, and continually tailor themselves
to us just as we do to them -- then the line between tool and user
becomes flimsy indeed.]{.underline} (2004, 7) [While this observation
about the blurring of the line between humans and technological products
could easily have been written by someone who would preach
caution]{.underline} at such a merging with machines, [Clark is a vocal
optimist about the momentous transition that he describes.]{.underline}
Clark is correct to suggest that this change, marked by a situation in
which the technological extensions of our powers begin to "dovetail
back," is fundamentally important, and requires attention. [There is a
subtle phenomenological difference between the situation of a blind
person with a cane]{.underline} (as described, for example, by
Merleau-Ponty) [and a situation in which the enhancement is performed by
a technological product, designed by other people and purchased by the
"user." In both situations there is a dimension in which there is a
"flimsy" line between the hand and the tool]{.underline}; however, this
facility is developed by the blind person through interaction and
practice. All people develop organic relations with the world --
relations that are more noticeable in people with disabilities -- in
which cane, pen, paper, eyeglasses, etc., are phenomenologically
extensions of the hand, the mind, and the eye. These organic relations,
however, are fundamentally different from a cybernetic attachment
through which our relation to the world is designed, marketed, and then
purchased according to the whim and will of the designers and the
corporation that sells the cybernetic product. In his book, Clark
addresses several worries about these changes that he has encountered in
being a vocal proponent of transhumanism. In particular[, he discusses
the concern that technology might come to "control" us:]{.underline}
"[Many feel, for example, that increased human-machine symbiosis
directly implies increasing control.]{.underline} In an age of
ubiquitous computing must we be slaves to the whims of the machines that
surround us?" (2004, 175). Here, Clark addresses what he takes to be the
concern that if we become merged with machines, the machines might
"control" us; he is, however, operating on what I take to be an
extremely mundane and even naïve conception of "control"; he does not
seem to give any credence to the more subtle negative forms of influence
that merging consciousness with technology might have. Thus, [he
responds: "... the kind of control we, both as individuals and as
society, look likely to retain is precisely the kind we always had: no
more no less... **The fear of 'loss of control,' as we cede more and
more to a web of technological innovations is simply misplaced"** (2004,
175). Perhaps he is right to say that the kind of control we have over
technology]{.underline} [-- and the control it has over us -- is no
different in kind from the influence modern technology has
over]{.underline} [us]{.underline}; but if Heidegger is correct, the
extension of that control to our biology and to the direct alteration of
our consciousness and our genetic code is reason enough for serious
caution and reflection. In the Parmenides, Heidegger writes: Perhaps the
much discussed question of whether technology makes man its slave or
whether man will be able to be the master of technology is already a
superficial question, because no one remembers to ask what kind of man
is alone capable of carrying out the "mastery" of technology. (1998, 86)
