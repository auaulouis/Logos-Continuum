# EU CP -- BFHR 

### Notes 

#### There are three versions of the CP 

1)  The EU unilaterally acts -- internal net benefit of EU cohesion

2)  The EU works with NATO -- China net benefit

3)  The EU works with the US -- external net benefits

#### There are some aff answers, but tbh the best answers are probably the built in US-NATO coop key warrants in each aff. 

#### All the DAs produced at camp so far are probably net benefits to most versions of the CP, so there's a lot of flexibility as to what you want to go with it. 

#### A lot of the solvency stuff can be taken from one module and applied to the other two -- creative highlighting solves!

Less than a century ago, Edmund **[Husserl's warning words about Europe
were more than farsighted: "the gravest danger menacing Europe is its
lassitude"]{.underline}** (quoted in Bauman 2014). **[Applied to
the]{.underline}** European Union's (**[EU]{.underline}**) Common
Security and Defence Policy (**[CSDP]{.underline}**), **[his words ring
even truer. In the current climate of fiscal and economic austerity,
recent [debates on]{.mark} the [EU]{.mark}'s [security]{.mark} and
defence capabilities have [centred on Europe's clear lag]{.mark}, warned
against cuts in national defence budgets, and called for a new level of
ambition and 'pooling and sharing' strategies]{.underline}** for
enhanced defence cooperation at the European level. Nevertheless, the
case for strengthening the EU's security and defence policy is even
harder to endorse in domestic debates over resources and priorities,
especially concerning high-tech security technologies. **[The European
defence sector contends with public finances under pressure from growing
pension burdens, shrinking recruitment pools and states increasingly
cautious about interventionist military operations or unwarranted
military capabilities spending.]{.underline}**

**[This chapter looks at the EU's recent impetus to fund]{.underline}**
for serious military capacity **[build-up through dual-use and emerging
technologies such as artificial intelligence]{.underline}** (AI) and
autonomous robotics. According to the European Commission, Future and
Emerging Technologies (FET) "go beyond what is known!" and
"\[v\]isionary thinking can open up promising avenues towards powerful
new technologies" (FET 2018). FETs have been allocated a provisional
budged of €2.696 million under the Horizon 2020, having three
complementary lines of actions: FET Open funding projects on new ideas
for radically new future technologies, including unconventional research
and innovation collaborations and practices; FET Proactive nurturing
emerging themes and establishing a critical mass of European researches
in order to build new interdisciplinary research communities; and **[FET
Flagships that are "1-billion, 10-years initiatives where hundreds of
excellence European researchers unite forces to focus on solving an
ambitious scientific and technological challenge"]{.underline}** (FET
2018). The Work Programme of 2018--2020 (FET 2018--2020) under the
Horizon 2020 started in 2016, highlighted among others a new generation
of robotics technologies, human-machine interfaces and cooperation,
cognition and AI as well as quantum computing and its advantages to
solve challenging industrial and scientific problems such as the
development of protocols, controls and benchmarking for real life
applications (FET 2018--2020, pp. 34, 38).

**[The framing of FETs is particularly significant, because such
[tech]{.mark}nologies and the inter- and multidisciplinary research and
innovation synergies [that are prioritised by the European Commission
are expected to transform "Europe's science base]{.mark} in[to a
competitive advantage]{.mark}", as well as "[initiate]{.mark} new lines
of [tech]{.mark}nology [through unexplored collaborations
between]{.mark} advanced multidisciplinary [science and]{.mark}
cuttingedge [engineering]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (FET 2018). Most
importantly, **[[they]{.mark} can [have spill over effects in]{.mark}
the areas of [security]{.mark} and defence [and]{.mark} in the case of
[civil-military applications]{.mark} in the security continuum [between
internal and external security]{.mark} in Europe. They likewise express
an undeniable technologisation trend to push for high-tech
multidisciplinary]{.underline}** Research & Development
(**[R&D]{.underline}**) **[in areas of strategic and global
competition]{.underline}**. This is reflected in the EU's policymaking
that has been actively pursuing neoliberal strategies to also revamp a
lagging behind European Defence Technological and Industrial Base
(EDTIB) and the proliferation of discourses regarding the strategic and
economic advantages of frontier or game-changing dual-use technologies
(Csernatoni 2018, p. 190). **[To this end, [the]{.mark} underlying [goal
is]{.mark} to ensure that [Europe]{.mark} will have a [leadership role
"early]{.mark} on [in those]{.mark} promising [future technology
areas]{.mark} able [to renew the basis for]{.mark} future [European
competitiveness]{.mark} and growth]{.underline}**" (FET 2018).

**[[The EU is poised to tackle]{.mark} challenging global phenomena and
[major mutations]{.mark} engendered [by]{.mark} a so-called fourth
industrial revolution and a new age of ever more sophisticated
[technologies like cyber]{.mark} technologies, autonomous robotics [and
AI]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Such **[game-changing technical advancements
have important civilian and military applications in different
areas]{.underline}**, by creating new markets, triggering new
cooperation in key industrial domains and transforming civil-military
relations in Europe and the world. **[They galvanise a variety of actors
and different levels of analysis, intertwining multidisciplinary
research approaches and different technical, socio-political, economic
and security fields]{.underline}**. In this regard, scholarship should
be focused on evaluating the geopolitical, policy, social, ethical and
legal challenges of such technologies in a world increasingly driven by
digital and automated technologies in all aspects of activity, including
security and defence. 'Big Tech' and major leaders such as the USA and
China, with Canada, Israel, France, Russia and the United Kingdom
holding key positions in these fields, are currently driving the
innovation agenda and arms race in AI-enabled and autonomous security
technologies. However, a balance must be reached between such
innovations and future technological artefacts that comply with
democratic and legal requirements, social norms and ethical values and
the EU could play a significant role in their meaningful governance.

In the last few years, the emergence of new technologies has stimulated
worldwide debates on their uses, risks and potential benefits.
**[Emerging autonomous technologies are a set of smart technologies that
are rapidly converging and are often interrelated, connected or fully
integrated, such as AI, machine learning algorithms, deep learning,
cyber networks and robotics]{.underline}** (European Commission 2018a,
p. 5). Such technologies are creating new synergies in key industrial
domains at national, European and transnational levels, encompassing a
host of implications for both civil and military objectives. In the
European context, EU institutions and agencies such as the European
Commission, European Parliament and European Defence Agency (EDA) have
been taking part in discussions surrounding their R&D and governance, by
creating the impetus to strengthen market growth, competitiveness,
innovation and regulation in these sectors.

#### EU strength prevent [global conflict]{.underline} and [transnational threats]{.underline}\-\--extinction

**[[In a brittle world]{.mark} without enduring strong international
alliances]{.underline}**, the debate on **[Europe's 'strategic autonomy'
has gained new resonance, but it should not shadow the [EU's
unique]{.mark} key international [assets in the]{.mark} global [economy
and multilat]{.mark}eral order. Working with global networks to [promote
norms and public goods]{.mark} is [key to push back]{.mark} on
[nationalism]{.mark}, the rise of geopolitics and
transactionalism.]{.underline}**

Strategic autonomy' and 'complementarity with NATO' usually appear in
the same sentence in the European debate -- the latest doctrinal
iteration to be found in the EU Global Strategy of June 2016. The
ensemble reflects Europe's need to rely on its transatlantic
relationship for security and territorial defence, empowering it to
carry out foreign policy too. The EU's greatest foreign policy
achievement of enlarging to Central Europe after the Cold War, pursued
in tandem with NATO expansion, is testimony to this pairing.

Since the end of 2016, the US President's international preferences
undermine directly or indirectly Europe's security. Whether it is the
insistence on greater burden-sharing, US action in the Middle East, or
trade disputes with China, current US policies put Europe's security --
already challenged by Russian action in Eastern Europe and the Middle
East -- at risk.

European leaders have started to question whether the transatlantic
relationship needs to be preserved no matter what, or whether Europe
should emancipate from it. **[The debate on 'strategic
autonomy']{.underline}** is animating recent efforts in the field of
security and defence. It **[refers to the ability to make and carry out
decisions on defence, to conduct [military op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}
autonomously, and to have the industrial capabilities to do so. Even
if]{.underline}** this level of strategic autonomy were **[agreed upon,
it would take a generation for Europe to affect the world
stage]{.underline}**.

**[The focus]{.underline}** on strategic autonomy **[[speak]{.mark}s
to]{.underline}** present **[insecurities in Europe]{.underline}**an
societies, **[but [not to]{.mark} the EU's international [legitimacy
where]{.mark}]{.underline}**, possibly, **[the
[E]{.mark}]{.underline}**uropean **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion
**[[has better opportunities to develop]{.mark} means of political
[autonomy]{.mark} which befit its history and international
identity]{.underline}**. The emerging debate on economic sovereignty is
addressing for the first time the degree to which the EU can make
political use of some of its economic and financial tools, such as the
Euro as an international currency. After all, the EU and its Member
States remain the world's largest trade bloc and donor.

**[On the multilateral stage, [Europe faces an increasingly hostile
environment but remains]{.mark} the [best]{.mark} hope [to
pursue]{.mark} universal principles, such as [human rights and]{.mark}
the [rule of law, which underpin]{.mark} the [resilience]{.mark} of that
multilateral system. How [to partner]{.mark} with other countries and
actors around the globe [to push back]{.mark} on [attacks to
international order is]{.mark} no longer [a]{.mark} second order
[priority]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

If the way ahead appears clear, achieving it is a tall order. The
rationale for collective action for the EU seems obvious -- the
'politics of scale', or to be stronger together rather than weaker apart
-- but historically difficult to achieve. **[The multiple threats and
risks]{.underline}** on Europe's doorsteps **[have only minimally
bridged the strategic divergence that continues to beset the
continent]{.underline}**, and **[the rise of the populist radical right
is beginning to undermine existing European external policies, not to
speak of a higher level of ambition.]{.underline}**

Looking at global politics from a non-European perspective, how Europe's
friends and partners around the world will welcome a bid for greater
autonomy -- politically, economically, and strategically -- still needs
to be seen. The EU's worldview that it has acted as a 'force for good'
is not uncritically accepted. After all, that ethical stand was also
possible thanks to the EU's belonging to a stable and hegemonic West.

If Europe wants to engage with the world and simultaneously strengthen
its strategic identity it needs to square some circles. **[[Without
giving into]{.mark} the [facile critique that]{.mark} realism and
[geopolitics render multilat]{.mark}eral principles [obsolete]{.mark}
and warrant hard-nosed politics, [Europe should leverage]{.mark} its
[assets]{.mark}, which are irrevocably embedded [in]{.mark}
multilateralism and [coop]{.mark}eration. [Climate]{.mark} change,
[conflict]{.mark} prevention and [mediation, and]{.mark} an
[open]{.mark} and fairer international [trade]{.mark} system [are
among]{.mark} the [assets]{.mark} that the [EU can]{.mark} concretely
[work towards]{.mark} globally]{.underline}**.

To do so it needs to engage flexibly with global actors, focusing more
on multilevel networks including civil society rather than on the
traditional partnerships between governments, some of which are no
longer benign or useful. Both will require a dose of humility in
listening to non-European world views and of pragmatism in seeking
appropriate strategies and paths forward.

Last but not least, if **[[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}** wants to
imagine its own history of prosperity, democracy and peace as still
relevant to the debates taking place in the rest of the world, it also
**[[needs to think abou]{.mark}t the [global]{.mark} future
[sustainability]{.mark} of welfare]{.underline}**, taking progressive
politics outside national boundaries and **[[engaging in]{.mark} a more
global]{.underline}** and open **[debate about public [common
goods]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[Such an approach to procurement could prove particularly helpful

supply chain]{.underline}**. The **[COVID]{.underline}**-19 pandemic has
**[unveiled Western countries' strong dependency on Chinese supplies,
both in the medical and technological fields]{.underline}** (though the
supply issues around personal protective equipment were addressed
relatively rapidly).75 A recent study by the Mercator Institute for
China Studies identifies **[103 categories of electronics, chemical,
mineral/metal, and pharmaceutical products in which the EU is critically
dependent on imports from China]{.underline}**.76 At the same time,
**[as economies worldwide have started to]{.underline}** recover from
the pandemic and **[embark on ambitious investment plans to boost
innovation in their national industries, the demand for semiconductors
--- crucial for building microchips, which are essential in any modern
technology --- has increased and become one of the central issues of the
U.S.-China competition]{.underline}**. This issue is **[further
complicated by geopolitical concerns; a large proportion of
semiconductor manufacturing occurs in Taiwan.]{.underline}**77 The
**[U.S. and the EU have recently begun initiatives to increase the
domestic production of microchips.]{.underline}** In June, the U.S.
Senate passed the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors
(CHIPS) for America Act, which allocates \$52 billion toward the
effort.78 And the EU followed suit with European Commission President

**[first step]{.underline}** **[toward breaking the ice on
trans-Atlantic cooperation]{.underline}**, **[particularly related to
developing new technologies that are vital for enhancing geopolitical
and economic security]{.underline}**. **[But]{.underline}** the main
takeaways are that **[the U.S. and the EU are facing the same challenges
and that the EU has increased its geopolitical ambition and range of
interests]{.underline}**. So far, **[there is no similar dialogue
platform between NATO and the EU --- a fact that hinders
inter-institutional cooperation in the procurement

facilitate technological exchanges as well as the interoperability of
equipment (be it artificial intelligence or more traditional military

increasing importance of new technologies]{.underline}** for economic
development, industrial advancement, and innovation, **[the only

#### Chinese tech leadership leads to nuclear war

**Kroenig, professor of government, writes in 2018**, Deputy Director
for Strategy, Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security Associate
Professor of Government and Foreign Service, Georgetown University
(Matthew, Nov 12, 2018, "Will disruptive technology cause nuclear war?"
*BAS*,
<https://thebulletin.org/2018/11/will-disruptive-technology-cause-nuclear-war>)

Recently, analysts have argued that emerging technologies with military
applications may undermine nuclear stability (see here, here, and here),
but the logic of these arguments is debatable and overlooks a more
straightforward reason why **[new technology might cause nuclear
conflict: by upending the existing balance of power among nuclear-armed
states.]{.underline}** This latter concern is more probable and
dangerous and demands an immediate policy response. For more than 70
years, the world has avoided major power conflict, and many attribute
this era of peace to nuclear weapons. In situations of mutually assured
destruction (MAD), neither side has an incentive to start a conflict
because doing so will only result in its own annihilation. The key to
this model of deterrence is the maintenance of secure second-strike
capabilities---the ability to absorb an enemy nuclear attack and respond
with a devastating counterattack. Recently analysts have begun to worry,
however, that new strategic military technologies may make it possible
for a state to conduct a successful first strike on an enemy. For
example, Chinese colleagues have complained to me in Track II dialogues
that the United States may decide to launch a sophisticated cyberattack
against Chinese nuclear command and control, essentially turning off
China's nuclear forces. Then, Washington will follow up with a massive
strike with conventional cruise and hypersonic missiles to destroy
China's nuclear weapons. Finally, if any Chinese forces happen to
survive, the United States can simply mop up China's ragged retaliatory
strike with advanced missile defenses. China will be disarmed and US
nuclear weapons will still be sitting on the shelf, untouched. If the
United States, or any other state acquires such a first-strike
capability, then the logic of MAD would be undermined. Washington may be
tempted to launch a nuclear first strike. Or China may choose instead to
use its nuclear weapons early in a conflict before they can be wiped
out---the so-called "use 'em or lose 'em" problem. According to this
logic, therefore, the appropriate policy response would be to ban
outright or control any new weapon systems that might threaten
second-strike capabilities. This way of thinking about new technology
and stability, however, is open to question. Would any US president
truly decide to launch a massive, bolt-out-of-the-blue nuclear attack
because he or she thought s/he could get away with it? And why does it
make sense for the country in the inferior position, in this case China,
to intentionally start a nuclear war that it will almost certainly lose?
More important, this conceptualization of how new technology affects
stability is too narrow, focused exclusively on how new military
technologies might be used against nuclear forces directly. Rather, we
should think more broadly about how new technology might affect global
politics, and, for this, it is helpful to turn to scholarly
international relations theory. **[The dominant theory of the causes of
war in the academy is [the]{.mark} "[bargaining model of war.]{.mark}"
This theory [identifies rapid shifts in the balance of power as a
primary cause of conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline}** International politics
often presents states with conflicts that they can settle through
peaceful bargaining, but when bargaining breaks down, war results.
[**Shifts in the** balance of power **are problematic because they
undermine effective bargaining.**]{.underline} After all, why agree to a
deal today if your bargaining position will be stronger tomorrow? And, a
clear understanding of the military balance of power can contribute to
peace. (Why start a war you are likely to lose?) But shifts in the
balance of power muddy understandings of which states have the
advantage. You may see where this is going. **[New technologies threaten
to create potentially destabilizing shifts in the balance of power. For
decades, stability in Europe and Asia has been supported by US military
power]{.underline}**. In recent years, however, **[the balance of power
in Asia has begun to shift]{.underline}**, as **[China has increased its
military capabilities]{.underline}**. Already, **[Beijing has become
more assertive in the region]{.underline}**, **[claiming contested
territory in the South China Sea]{.underline}**. And the results of
Russia's military modernization have been on full display in its ongoing
intervention in Ukraine. Moreover, **[[China may have]{.mark} the
[lead]{.mark} over the United States [in emerging tech]{.mark}nologies
[that could be decisive for]{.mark} the [future of military]{.mark}
acquisitions [and warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[including 3D
printing, hypersonic missiles, quantum computing, 5G wireless
connectivity, and artificial intelligence (AI).]{.underline}** And
Russian President Vladimir Putin is building new unmanned vehicles while
ominously declaring, "Whoever leads in AI will rule the world." If China
or Russia are able to incorporate new technologies into their militaries
before the United States, then this could lead to the kind of rapid
shift in the balance of power that often causes war. **[[If Beijing
believes emerging technologies]{.mark} [provide]{.mark} it with
[a]{.mark} newfound, local [military advantage]{.mark} over the United
States, for example, [it may be more willing]{.mark} than previously [to
initiate conflict over Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And if Putin
thinks new tech has strengthened his hand, he may be more tempted to
launch a Ukraine-style invasion of a NATO member. **[Either scenario
could bring these nuclear powers into direct conflict with the United
States, and once nuclear armed states are at war, [there is an inherent
risk of nuclear conflict through]{.mark} limited nuclear war strategies,
[nuclear brinkmanship, or]{.mark} simple accident or [inadvertent
escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This framing of the problem leads to
a different set of policy implications. The concern is not simply
technologies that threaten to undermine nuclear second-strike
capabilities directly, but, rather, any technologies that can result in
a meaningful shift in the broader balance of power. And the solution is
not to preserve second-strike capabilities, but to preserve prevailing
power balances more broadly. When it comes to new technology, this means
that the United States should seek to maintain an innovation edge.
Washington should also work with other states, including its
nuclear-armed rivals, to develop a new set of arms control and
nonproliferation agreements and export controls to deny these newer and
potentially destabilizing technologies to potentially hostile states.
**[These are no easy tasks, but the consequences of Washington losing
the race for technological superiority to its autocratic challengers
just might mean nuclear Armageddon]{.underline}**.

### \-\--Defense Autonomy NB

#### EU-NATO coordination is [possible now]{.underline} --- but US intervention via security cooperation wrecks it --- link alone turns case.

This is a **[major [structural shift]{.mark}]{.underline}** that
**[[Washington and NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** simply **[[must reckon
with]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But, instead of seeing this development as
a challenge to the current structure of the NATO alliance, it should in
fact be seen as a huge opportunity. The once **[seemingly impossible
[task of integrating Eu]{.mark}]{.underline}**ropean forces **[[and
addressing fragmentation]{.underline}]{.mark}** and redundancies has now
been **[[made possible through]{.underline}]{.mark}** Europe forming
**[a [political union]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[[Yet U.S. policy]{.underline}]{.mark}** has **[[consistently opposed
EU]{.mark} defense [efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}** since the late 1990s,
**[[arguing]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[EU]{.underline}]{.mark}**
defense **[efforts would [undermine NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**. State
Department officials' oft-repeated claim, virtually unchanged over the
past three decades, is that an EU defense structure would "duplicate"
NATO, making the treaty organization obsolete. Democratic and Republican
administrations have repeated the **[mantra]{.underline}** "**[no
duplication]{.underline}**" so often that it has become U.S. policy
doctrine.5 But **[rarely]{.underline}**, if ever, is the concern about
possible duplication **[actually unpacked and assessed]{.underline}**.

This report rejects the notion that NATO and EU defense are incompatible
and at odds. Supporting EU defense does not mean choosing the EU over
NATO. This is a false choice and a faulty premise. The **[EU and NATO
are not opposing organizations]{.underline}**. They are, in fact,
fundamentally tethered. **[Implicit in U.S. opposition is]{.underline}**
a **[fear of a powerful EU that]{.underline}** could **[supplant NATO
and become a thorn in America's side]{.underline}**. But the EU is not
divorced from the 21 NATO member states that make up the EU. If the EU
and United States became rivals, then NATO would itself be obsolete, as
it would be divided against itself. Such fanciful scenarios would not be
the result of the EU developing a defense capacity but the result of a
massive diplomatic breakdown. Such a breakdown is highly unlikely, and
U.S. foreign policy should be doing everything possible to avoid this
scenario.

As this report argues, the **[[EU]{.mark} could [significantly
strengthen NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the trans-Atlantic alliance.
**[[Integrating]{.mark} [European forces]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
acquiring key capabilities, **[rationalizing and [harmonizing
the]{.mark}]{.underline}** sprawling **[EU [defense
sector]{.mark},]{.underline}** and **[investing in cutting-edge
[research]{.mark}]{.underline}** are some of the areas where the **[EU
could play a critical role]{.underline}**. As the EU develops its own
defense capabilities, there would inevitably be some institutional
overlap and duplication with NATO, just as there is with any other
national military. But even if the EU's defense efforts were to create
some overlap and institutional friction, this would be a rather small
bureaucratic concern --- one that could easily be addressed by better
**[[EU-NATO coordination]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Yet the bureaucratic
worry over duplication has been elevated to such an extent that it has
become untethered from its actual significance, which is quite minor.
Instead of fretting over bureaucratic trivia, the United States and NATO
should focus on incorporating the EU defense effort into NATO and
embedding the EU in the Atlantic framework.

Skeptics will scoff at the potential for EU defense, pointing to the
limited and highly bureaucratic nature of current EU defense efforts.
But **[[Washington's opposition]{.underline}]{.mark}** has
**[[created]{.mark} a [feedback loop that]{.mark} has [blocked
progress]{.mark} on EU defense]{.underline}**. U.S. opposition makes
putting forth bold or ambitious defense proposals unrealistic, leading
the EU to propose niche initiatives that are often highly constrained
bureaucratic endeavors with little ambition. This then reinforces the
view in Washington that the EU is incapable of doing defense. The
limited nature of current EU defense efforts is no doubt the fault of
the EU. But the **[immense agency the United States has on European
defense]{.underline}** questions is also **[undeniable]{.underline}**.
Since the 1990s, the **[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}**
has **[wielded its [influence]{.mark}]{.underline}**, often **[by

Today, in what could become a second Cold War, this time with China,
**[the U.S. and Europe need to put great emphasis on cooperating
economically]{.underline}**. The reason for this is straightforward:
From the vantage point of each of the transatlantic partners, **[China
poses a threat to our economic competitiveness]{.underline}**. More
transatlantic technology cooperation needed As such, **[it is incumbent
upon the U.S. and the EU to build upon the initial steps of the new
US-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC]{.underline}**). The goal must
be, first, **[to reduce economic tensions between the two regions and
second, to foster formal cooperation]{.underline}**. **[This is
especially true with regard to supporting advanced and emerging
technology development and production]{.underline}**. China: Unfair,
state-directed capitalism As Barry Naughton notes in The Rise of China's
Industrial Policy: 1978 to 2020, **[China has not only become the
world's manufacturing workshop]{.underline}**. **[It is also seeking to
be the world leader in emerging technologies such as biotechnology,
robotics, artificial intelligence]{.underline}** and others. What's
more, **[China is]{.underline}** not only seeking absolute advantage on
a host of technologies. It **[is seeking that advantage largely through
unfair, state-directed capitalism]{.underline}**. To be sure, both the
EU and the United States have industrial policies -- but these policies
mostly support foundational elements like workforce training,
infrastructure and R&D. China looking for dominance In contrast,
**[China's predatory regime]{.underline}**, especially subsidies to
industry, **[goes way beyond what is considered acceptable industrial
policy]{.underline}**. On top of that, the **[C]{.underline}**hinese
**[C]{.underline}**ommunist **[P]{.underline}**arty **[compels
technology transfer]{.underline}** for market access, **[encourages
intellectual property theft]{.underline}** and operates tax and
regulatory policies that discriminate against EU and U.S. firms.
**[That,]{.underline}** combined with real strengths of the Chinese
economy -- a massive domestic market that lures in foreign investment, a
massive technical and scientific labor force and improving research
universities -- **[mean that China is gaining rapidly
technologically]{.underline}**. At the expense of EU and U.S. **[That
gain has and will come at the expense of the EU's and U.S.'s global
market shares in advanced tech]{.underline}**nologies. **[The result of
that shift cannot be underestimated]{.underline}**. Initially, China
systematically assembled the components needed to be the manufacturing
workshop of the world. **[This systematic approach has made it
hard]{.underline}**, even with the Trump tariffs and measures by Japan
and other countries, **[to move production out of China]{.underline}**.
Silicon China? Now, China is seeking to establish the same robust
innovation ecosystem that will give it strong reinforcing strengths.
**[China wants]{.underline}** to be not Silicon Valley, but **[Silicon
China]{.underline}** -- and not just for IT, but **[for]{.underline}**
**[every advanced technology]{.underline}**. The list of tech sectors
China seeks to dominate is long. It ranges from aviation, battery
technology, biotech, materials, clean energy, transportation, machinery
and, of course, advanced IT. **[If China were to achieve this leadership
position]{.underline}**, its lead will become self-reinforcing as
competitors weaken and China's advantages (e.g., capital, STEM workers,
patents, tacit knowledge) improve. Not another Asian tiger If China were
simply following the path of the Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, Singapore,
South Korea and Taiwan), there would be less to worry about. All of
these countries, as well as Japan, only sought comparative advantage in
some industries -- as opposed to absolute advantage in most industries.
More crucially, they were (or quickly became) democracies that did not
seek to challenge long-standing principles of the rule of law and human
rights. A Maoist global hegemon? China not only seeks absolute advantage
in most if not all advanced and emerging industries. Under the
leadership of President Xi, it has become clear that China is reverting
to its Leninist and Maoist authoritarian origins. **[If China becomes
the global tech]{.underline}**nology leader, **[it reinforces China's
efforts to be militarily superior and a global hegemon]{.underline}**.
**[That would give China the ability to hold the West hostage for key
products and supplies]{.underline}**. What to do? Three steps There are
three key steps **[the United States and Europe should]{.underline}**
take. First, stop fighting each other economically. Resolving the
long-standing Boeing-Airbus feud and focusing on the real challenger --
China's Comac -- was a good first step. The United States eliminating
its steel and aluminum tariffs on EU imports was a good second step. For
its part, Europe, including member states like Germany and France, needs
to dial back its "digital sovereignty" agenda which is targeted at the
United States and U.S. companies. Second, both regions need to **[ramp
up cooperation]{.underline}** against unfair Chinese economic practices,
**[including cooperation on cybersecurity,]{.underline}** investment
screening, bringing trade cases before the WTO and cooperative export
controls. Time for more formal EU-US technology policy cooperation
Finally, and most ambitiously, it is time for **[more formal EU-US
technology policy cooperation]{.underline}**. In a world where the
development of technology has become much more technologically complex,
**[neither region is large enough to specialize in all major
technologies]{.underline}**. Therefore, **[each region should allow the
other region's companies to participate in government-funded industry
research programs]{.underline}**, like the EU's Horizon 2020 program and
similar U.S. programs that agencies like the National Science Foundation
operate. Moreover, **[as the governments roll out or expand specialized
technology programs in technologies like 6G, energy storage, battery
technology, autonomous systems, quantum computing and
semiconductors,]{.underline}** **[there should be joint collaboration
between US and EU firms, universities and governments]{.underline}**.
Finally, **[governments should review and minimize or eliminate
regulatory barriers to science and technology
cooperation]{.underline}**, **[including enabling easier cross-border
work of scientists and engineers.]{.underline}** Conclusion The sooner
the EU and the U.S. can stop seeing each other as the competition and
work to address the real technology competitiveness challenge -- China
-- the more likely both regions can ensure their economic futures, while
upholding critical values.

#### Chinese tech leadership leads to nuclear war

**Kroenig, professor of government, writes in 2018**, Deputy Director
for Strategy, Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security Associate
Professor of Government and Foreign Service, Georgetown University
(Matthew, Nov 12, 2018, "Will disruptive technology cause nuclear war?"
*BAS*,
<https://thebulletin.org/2018/11/will-disruptive-technology-cause-nuclear-war>)

Recently, analysts have argued that emerging technologies with military
applications may undermine nuclear stability (see here, here, and here),
but the logic of these arguments is debatable and overlooks a more
straightforward reason why **[new technology might cause nuclear
conflict: by upending the existing balance of power among nuclear-armed
states.]{.underline}** This latter concern is more probable and
dangerous and demands an immediate policy response. For more than 70
years, the world has avoided major power conflict, and many attribute
this era of peace to nuclear weapons. In situations of mutually assured
destruction (MAD), neither side has an incentive to start a conflict
because doing so will only result in its own annihilation. The key to
this model of deterrence is the maintenance of secure second-strike
capabilities---the ability to absorb an enemy nuclear attack and respond
with a devastating counterattack. Recently analysts have begun to worry,
however, that new strategic military technologies may make it possible
for a state to conduct a successful first strike on an enemy. For
example, Chinese colleagues have complained to me in Track II dialogues
that the United States may decide to launch a sophisticated cyberattack
against Chinese nuclear command and control, essentially turning off
China's nuclear forces. Then, Washington will follow up with a massive
strike with conventional cruise and hypersonic missiles to destroy
China's nuclear weapons. Finally, if any Chinese forces happen to
survive, the United States can simply mop up China's ragged retaliatory
strike with advanced missile defenses. China will be disarmed and US
nuclear weapons will still be sitting on the shelf, untouched. If the
United States, or any other state acquires such a first-strike
capability, then the logic of MAD would be undermined. Washington may be
tempted to launch a nuclear first strike. Or China may choose instead to
use its nuclear weapons early in a conflict before they can be wiped
out---the so-called "use 'em or lose 'em" problem. According to this
logic, therefore, the appropriate policy response would be to ban
outright or control any new weapon systems that might threaten
second-strike capabilities. This way of thinking about new technology
and stability, however, is open to question. Would any US president
truly decide to launch a massive, bolt-out-of-the-blue nuclear attack
because he or she thought s/he could get away with it? And why does it
make sense for the country in the inferior position, in this case China,
to intentionally start a nuclear war that it will almost certainly lose?
More important, this conceptualization of how new technology affects
stability is too narrow, focused exclusively on how new military
technologies might be used against nuclear forces directly. Rather, we
should think more broadly about how new technology might affect global
politics, and, for this, it is helpful to turn to scholarly
international relations theory. **[The dominant theory of the causes of
war in the academy is [the]{.mark} "[bargaining model of war.]{.mark}"
This theory [identifies rapid shifts in the balance of power as a
primary cause of conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline}** International politics
often presents states with conflicts that they can settle through
peaceful bargaining, but when bargaining breaks down, war results.
[**Shifts in the** balance of power **are problematic because they
undermine effective bargaining.**]{.underline} After all, why agree to a
deal today if your bargaining position will be stronger tomorrow? And, a
clear understanding of the military balance of power can contribute to
peace. (Why start a war you are likely to lose?) But shifts in the
balance of power muddy understandings of which states have the
advantage. You may see where this is going. **[New technologies threaten
to create potentially destabilizing shifts in the balance of power. For
decades, stability in Europe and Asia has been supported by US military
power]{.underline}**. In recent years, however, **[the balance of power
in Asia has begun to shift]{.underline}**, as **[China has increased its
military capabilities]{.underline}**. Already, **[Beijing has become
more assertive in the region]{.underline}**, **[claiming contested
territory in the South China Sea]{.underline}**. And the results of
Russia's military modernization have been on full display in its ongoing
intervention in Ukraine. Moreover, **[[China may have]{.mark} the
[lead]{.mark} over the United States [in emerging tech]{.mark}nologies
[that could be decisive for]{.mark} the [future of military]{.mark}
acquisitions [and warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[including 3D
printing, hypersonic missiles, quantum computing, 5G wireless
connectivity, and artificial intelligence (AI).]{.underline}** And
Russian President Vladimir Putin is building new unmanned vehicles while
ominously declaring, "Whoever leads in AI will rule the world." If China
or Russia are able to incorporate new technologies into their militaries
before the United States, then this could lead to the kind of rapid
shift in the balance of power that often causes war. **[[If Beijing
believes emerging technologies]{.mark} [provide]{.mark} it with
[a]{.mark} newfound, local [military advantage]{.mark} over the United
States, for example, [it may be more willing]{.mark} than previously [to
initiate conflict over Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And if Putin
thinks new tech has strengthened his hand, he may be more tempted to
launch a Ukraine-style invasion of a NATO member. **[Either scenario
could bring these nuclear powers into direct conflict with the United
States, and once nuclear armed states are at war, [there is an inherent
risk of nuclear conflict through]{.mark} limited nuclear war strategies,
[nuclear brinkmanship, or]{.mark} simple accident or [inadvertent
escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This framing of the problem leads to
a different set of policy implications. The concern is not simply
technologies that threaten to undermine nuclear second-strike
capabilities directly, but, rather, any technologies that can result in
a meaningful shift in the broader balance of power. And the solution is
not to preserve second-strike capabilities, but to preserve prevailing
power balances more broadly. When it comes to new technology, this means
that the United States should seek to maintain an innovation edge.
Washington should also work with other states, including its
nuclear-armed rivals, to develop a new set of arms control and
nonproliferation agreements and export controls to deny these newer and
potentially destabilizing technologies to potentially hostile states.
**[These are no easy tasks, but the consequences of Washington losing
the race for technological superiority to its autocratic challengers
just might mean nuclear Armageddon]{.underline}**.

### Block -- A2: PDB -- Generic (NATO version)

####  Europeans [are skeptical]{.underline} over US approaches on AI.

**Franke 21**, Dr. Ulrike Franke is a senior policy fellow at the
European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR). She leads ECFR's
Technology and European Power initiative. Her areas of focus include
German and European security and defence, the future of warfare, and the
impact of new technologies such as drones and artificial intelligence on
geopolitics and warfare., (Ulrike, "Artificial divide: How Europe and
America could clash over AI", European Council on Foreign Relations,

//CHC-DS 🐱‍👤

Finally, many **[Europeans have expressed scepticism about the extent to
which Europe and the US are]{.underline}** indeed **[aligned on ethical
AI principles]{.underline}**. For example, the **[Danish national AI
strategy argues for a common ethical and human-centred basis for
AI]{.underline}**. **[It describes ethical AI as a particularly European
approach: "Europe and Denmark should not copy the US or China. Both
countries are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, but with
little regard for responsibility, ethical principles and
privacy."]{.underline}** Many **[Europeans feel that the US "has no idea
how to regulate" cyberspace and continues to show little enthusiasm for
doing so.]{.underline}** The EU, however, likes to think of itself as a
trailblazer when it comes to digital rights, such as the 2014 "right to
be forgotten" or the 2018 General Data Protection Regulation.

Differing views on China

As noted, only a few European states look at AI through a geopolitical
lens, and EU efforts on this matter focus primarily on strengthening the
EU as a global player. This means that **[the American interest in using
transatlantic cooperation as a means to curb Chinese power is likely to
have only limited traction in Europe]{.underline}**. **[And US
companies, rather than Chinese ones, currently remain the primary
'other' for Europe to measure itself against. European regulation
efforts still concentrate on US companies rather than Chinese
firms.]{.underline}** In light of recent changes in language on China in
both NATO and the EU, which describe the country as a "strategic
competitor" and "systemic rival", European and American views of China
may converge eventually. But, at the moment, **[Europeans do not feel
the same urgency as the US when it comes to pushing back against
China]{.underline}**. Unfortunately **[for those in the US who favour
greater transatlantic cooperation, the European nation that most often
thinks in geopolitical terms, France, is among those most sceptical of
the US.]{.underline}**

### Block -- A2: PDB -- EU (NATO/Unilat Version)

#### US and European interests are [mutually exclusive]{.underline}\-\--including the US [trades off]{.underline} with EU autonomy.

The **[transatlantic alliance has had a bad four years]{.underline}**.
The **[Trump administration's]{.underline}** criticism of the United
Nations and the World Trade Organization, the president's **[threats to
leave NATO, and his active criticism of the EU all made Europeans wonder
whether they had lost their most important partner]{.underline}**.
Moreover, **[in light of the conflict over 5G, in the minds of many
Europeans, technology in particular has become an area that creates
conflict in the transatlantic relationship rather than fostering
cooperation.]{.underline}**

**[Although transatlantic relations are likely to improve under Biden,
substantial damage has been done]{.underline}**, and it will take some
time to mend these ties. But, **[even if]{.underline}** **[relations
improve, it is becoming increasingly obvious that US has a diminishing
interest in Europe as a geopolitically important part of the
world]{.underline}**. This **[trend]{.underline}** was **[already
visible under]{.underline}** Trump's predecessor, Barack
**[Obama]{.underline}**. It is, therefore, unsurprising that, **[on
technology cooperation, both sides emphasise the importance of working
with other actors]{.underline}** as well as each other. The US National
Security Commission on AI, for example, recommends that the US
Departments of State and Defense "should negotiate formal AI cooperation
agreements with Australia, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and
Vietnam". Its March 2020 report emphasises on several occasions the
importance of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance. Meanwhile,
**[Europeans are pursuing the idea of an alliance for
multilateralism]{.underline}**. And, **[on technology and
AI]{.underline}** more specifically, they have also begun to reach out
**[to]{.underline}** **[other]{.underline}** **[democratic
allies]{.underline}**.

European digital autonomy

The most important aspect of transatlantic estrangement, however, is not
the loss of trust between the US and Europe -- which they will
eventually reverse. Rather, during the four years of the Trump
administration, and partly **[in response to isolationist tendencies in
the US, Europeans have become much more comfortable talking about
European strategic autonomy or sovereignty]{.underline}**. Without
encouraging the narrative that these efforts are directed against the
US, or were primarily an answer to Trump, **[Europeans aim to empower
Europe as an actor in its own right]{.underline}**. **[In the
technological realm, this led to the idea of European digital
sovereignty, the aim of which is to build up European technological
capabilities.]{.underline}** Although **[European digital
sovereignty]{.underline}** is not specifically targeted at the US, it
**[has led]{.underline}**, among other things, **[to efforts such as the
possible regulation of American technology companies and concerns over
American firms acquiring European start-ups. European campaigners and
some policymakers believe US tech giants]{.underline}** such as Google,
Apple, Facebook, and Amazon **[are forces to protect
against]{.underline}**. **[European thinking on technology partly
developed in opposition to the US and US companies]{.underline}**. Thus,
European efforts to build up digital sovereignty may impede
transatlantic cooperation.

**[Today's major powers engage in comprehensive global
tech]{.underline}**nology **[politics]{.underline}**. The weaponisation,
mastering, and control of digital technologies is the new 'Great Game'.
**[These power dynamics]{.underline}** are helping **[shape
technological spheres of influence]{.underline}**. Countries in Latin
America and the Caribbean, Africa, and the Indo-Pacific -- but also in
central Eastern Europe and the Balkans -- have fallen or may soon fall
under Chinese or Russian technological influence or dominance. China is
luring countries into technological dependencies to undermine their
political sovereignty through its Digital Silk Road (DSR) initiative.
Beijing also shields its own citizens from foreign influence with its
'great firewall' and develops industrial strategies to secure its
technological autonomy from the West. It uses digital disinformation to
influence public opinion in other countries, mounts cyberattacks and
cyberespionage to strengthen its industrial base, strategically deploys
attractively-priced 5G technologies abroad to gain control of telecom
networks, and tries to impose its technical standards through
international organisations. Together with Russia, China is attempting
to ingrain authoritarian values into the global cyberspace. Russia is
also leveraging and restricting mass media and social networks to
protect its interests, shielding its population from democratic
temptations, and waging an information war against the West and its
allies with the aim of undermining citizens' faith in democracy.
Meanwhile, **[the United States tries to offset Chinese and Russian
influence]{.underline}**, **[seeks to maintain its cutting-edge
advantage on military]{.underline}** artificial intelligence (**[AI) and
other tech]{.underline}**nologies, **[and backs and protects the
interests of its major technology companies globally]{.underline}**.
**[It also denies other nations access to key
tech]{.underline}**nologies, **[monitors critical investments in the
technology sector to avoid security risks]{.underline}**, **[seeks to
secure and control critical supply chains]{.underline}** (especially of
semiconductors), **[and imposes export controls and even embargoes on
sensitive technologies.]{.underline}**

A weak European military **[European defense spending]{.underline}**,
specifically related to nations **[falling short of the NATO 2% of GDP
target, has been a major issue in U.S.-EU relations]{.underline}**.
While Barack Obama's administration exerted diplomatic pressure,
**[Donald Trump's engaged in open confrontation on this
issue]{.underline}**. **[Neither administration obtained significant
results]{.underline}**, however; and as Afghanistan has shown, **[Europe
is still far too reliant on the military protection of the United States
--- an issue that weakens NATO's posture]{.underline}**. Over the past
few years, the **[EU]{.underline}** has strengthened both its legal and
financial mechanisms to be more competitive on the security side. In
December 2017, under **[articles 42.6 and 46 of the Lisbon
Treaty]{.underline}**, the European Council **[established a Permanent
Structured Cooperation mechanism to deepen cooperation between willing
member states]{.underline}**. These **[states have agreed to binding
commitments on investment, planning and management to advance their
defense capabilities in the service of both national and multinational
operations (including those of NATO and the UN).]{.underline}** PESCO
currently has 46 projects in several domains, from training to maritime
and land exercises to cyber and military mobility.33 **[Through the
European Defense Fund, the EU also has allocated 7.9 billion euros
(roughly \$9 billion)]{.underline}** for the 2021-2027 period **[to
research innovative defense products and technologies through
collaborate development projects]{.underline}**.34 But **[while these
initiatives represent a step toward better European coordination on
defense issues, they are completely reliant on political will and
inter-governmental coordination]{.underline}** --- as security is not a
competence of the EU but an inalienable prerogative of its member
states. In fact, many of the PESCO projects appear to be severely
delayed.35 **[U.S. experts]{.underline}** interviewed for this research
also **[point out the bad shape of European defense and more broadly its
dependence on the United States for even more reachable defense
objectives.]{.underline}** A report from the Center for American
Progress mentions the example of France's anti-terrorism operation in
the Sahel, where the U.S. ended up supporting basic air-refueling and
surveillance flights.36 A detailed study by the Clingendael Institute
points out that if the **[EU]{.underline}** **[wants]{.underline}**
**[to be a]{.underline}** **[credible actor]{.underline}** **[in crisis
management, primarily in its neighborhood, then it should be able to
operate crossspectrum in the air, land, sea, cyberspace, and space
domains --- which cannot be done without more serious investments in
European defense]{.underline}**.37 The **[case of Afghanistan --- where
Europeans decided to leave after the U.S. withdrawal]{.underline}**
despite the predictable consequences on migration and political
instability **[--- offers a concrete example of such
shortcomings]{.underline}**.38 As Brookings expert Michael E. O'Hanlon
points out, Afghanistan operations did not require high-tech equipment
or massive resources; but **[the fact that European countries involved
in NATO operations in Afghanistan did not step up to preserve a military
presence in a crucial theater for European security speaks to their
unpreparedness in terms of stockpiles of equipment and inability to
conduct such operations without the help of the United
States]{.underline}**.39 Germany's defense capabilities are also
emblematic: Despite having more fiscal leeway and being at the forefront
of European technological innovation, Berlin has not invested in its
military, which still lacks critical equipment such as body armor, night
vision gear, and helicopter spare parts.40 In this regard, evidence
suggests that **[integrating and strengthening European defense would
undoubtedly offer more openings for specialization, boost resource
allocation and more broadly improve readiness]{.underline}**. Yet such
opportunities are highly contingent on building trust between allies and
increasing political will, which will inevitably take time and be
achieved in different ways. Recently, some inter-governmental
initiatives outside of the EU and NATO frameworks were taken to tackle
these shortcomings. In 2018, French President Emmanuel Macron launched
the **[European Intervention Initiative (E2I) with the aim of deepening
military cooperation between like-minded European governments sharing a

planning, joint planning and exercises, its 13 participants are working
to strengthen their military cooperation so that they can offer rapid

**Perm fails- strategic autonomy's a [precondition]{.underline} to EU
sovereignty**

Policy Centre, 7-19-2019, European Policy Centre, \"Strategic autonomy
forEuropean choices: The key to Europe's shaping power\" )//guyB

Paul Timmers frames [**strategic autonomy as "the ability, in terms of
capacity and capabilities**, to decide and act upon essential aspects of
one's longer-term future in the economy, society and their
institutions]{.underline}."28 This paper's author has argued that
[**strategic autonomy requires** "the ability to set objectives and
**mobilise** the necessary **resources in ways that do not primarily
depend on the decisions and assets of others**]{.underline}" and that
[it rests on four pillars, namely the Single Market, the euro, the
capacity for technological innovation and the capacity to provide for
Europe's security.]{.underline}29 In a recent contribution, Mark Leonard
and Jeremy Shapiro propose to replace the concept of strategic autonomy
with ['strategic sovereignty',]{.underline} which [subsumes geoeconomic
and geopolitical issues]{.underline} within an overarching approach and
[**allows "Europeans to decide their policies for themselves** and
bargain effectively within an interdependent system]{.underline}."30
[Pursuing **strategic autonomy** is therefore part of a renewed effort
to **strengthen the basis for European sovereignty**]{.underline}.
Taking a step back, [the political, institutional and functional
components are common to practically all the definitions of strategic
autonomy and are relevant to all areas where it can be
pursued]{.underline}. Politically, strategic autonomy requires a common
understanding of large goals, which is predicated on mutual trust and a
sense of shared destiny. In a political system of 28 countries, [the
EU's adequate institutions are also crucial in enabling decision-making,
setting rules and managing pooled resources in flexible, effective and
legitimate ways]{.underline}. The functional dimension includes both
[the material and immaterial resources that are to be aligned to fulfil
major goals and enable autonomous action when necessary]{.underline},
whether they be adequate funds, military capabilities or cutting-edge
technological expertise. 11 [**Strategic autonomy should also be related
to the question of European sovereignty and considered a precondition
for it**, with the understanding of sovereignty as "the ability to
control outcomes and respond to the fundamental needs of the
people".]{.underline}31 This is the heart of European integration:
sharing sovereignty in some domains to become more effective in its
exercise. Pursuing strategic autonomy is therefore part of a renewed
effort to strengthen the basis for European sovereignty in changing
international and domestic contexts. Given the serious internal and
external challenges to Europe's cohesion as illustrated in this
Discussion Paper, the requirements for European sovereignty are not
those of the past. In this sense, [strategic autonomy contributes to
sovereignty in **three ways**: in terms of **responsibility, resilience
and peer partnership**]{.underline}. Firstly, advancing strategic
autonomy implies [taking responsibility for Europe's future to a further
extent than is the case today]{.underline}. This requires creating the
conditions for Europeans to make shared decisions about critical issues
(e.g. the application of new technologies, a sustainable development
model, major foreign policy matters) and be equipped to implement them.
q Secondly, strategic autonomy is about strengthening the EU's own
resilience to the challenges of globalisation (from financial shocks to
massive migration flows) as well as to the political and economic
tactics employed deliberately by others to divide Europe. q Thirdly,
strategic autonomy is not about isolation, but rather building a
stronger platform for cooperation and partnership. In a world where big
powers are more assertive, strategic autonomy is necessary to enter into
peer partnerships with the heavyweights; and to avoid asymmetric
relationships, where isolated EU members lack bargaining power.
Concerning the scope of strategic autonomy, this should be assessed
against the background of the large shifts and challenges outlined
above. As the EU faces multilevel competition -- of which economic
statecraft, technological prowess and hybrid tactics are critical
dimensions --, delimiting the pursuit of strategic autonomy to defence
and security affairs is out of sync with the new strategic environment.
Strategic autonomy entails the mobilisation of all relevant EU resources
to strengthen Europe's global role, which is, in turn, essential to meet
the needs and expectations of its citizens. Two final elements must be
stressed to articulate the concept of strategic autonomy as applied to
the EU. For one, autonomy is not a binary concept but a matter of
degree. Full autonomy is, in many cases, unachievable and not
necessarily desirable, but progress can be achieved to make Europe more
self-reliant in advancing its interests and values. For another,
strategic autonomy takes time. Where Europe lags, such as in completing
the Single Market, developing some technological sectors or defence
capabilities, it will of course not catch up overnight. However, a clear
sense of direction should drive efforts over time, and its progress
should be regularly and seriously assessed. Bearing that in mind, some
of the building blocks of strategic autonomy are illustrated in the
following sections. 4. Strategic autonomy across the board [A meaningful
approach to Europe's strategic autonomy should encompass three principal
domains -- the economy, technology, and security and defence
matters]{.underline}. Progress in all three is essential in order for
Europe to take more responsibility not only for its security and
prosperity, but also for a stable, rules-based international order. The
EU agenda for the next five years and beyond should focus not only on
advancing strategic autonomy in distinct areas or policy fields but
also, and crucially, on taking an overarching approach to strategic
autonomy, assessing how progress in some fields (or lack thereof)
impacts others. For example, [it is hard to envisage the EU maintaining
its economic clout and therefore regulatory power if it falls behind the
curve of technological innovation]{.underline}. Likewise, the capacity
to protect critical infrastructures from cyberattacks is essential not
only to the defence and security of the Union but also to its broader
economic resilience and competitiveness. [Adequate military capabilities
to uphold stability in Europe's extended neighbourhood and protect the
openness of the global commons]{.underline} -- notably the sea, outer
space and cyberspace -- are also critical to the security of the flows
that Europe depends upon for its prosperity and stability.
[Furthermore**, it is only by taking an encompassing view of strategic
autonomy that the EU will be able to leverage it for a larger, positive
global agenda** and narrative in support of rules-based
cooperation.]{.underline}

**[Specifically]{.underline} true in tech regulation**

**Grevi 19** (Giovanni Grevi, a Senior Associate Fellow of the European
Policy Centre, 7-19-2019, European Policy Centre, \"Strategic autonomy
forEuropean choices: The key to Europe'sshaping power\" )//guyB

Technology has always been a primary source of prosperity and power.
Today, [new and emerging **technologies are reshaping the domains**,
terms **and tools of cooperation and competition on the international
stage. Technological**]{.underline} **[innovation is simultaneously
accelerating and increasingly diffused]{.underline}**. The acceleration
of digital innovation particularly creates unprecedented opportunities
for sustainable human development and well-being, civic and political
participation, and international cooperation. However, it also affects
the distribution of power at all levels, expands the grounds for
economic and political competition and creates new vulnerabilities. The
diffusion of technological innovation to new economic powerhouses and
the major advances made by China in key sectors, from fifth-generation
mobile technology (5G) to AI, will carry far-reaching implications for
economic growth, normative reach, political influence and security in
different parts of the world. As noted above, much of the current
competition between the US and China is about employing technological
primacy as an enabler of international leadership**. [The EU will fail
to advance towards strategic autonomy if it is not at the forefront of
both technological innovation and the efforts to regulate the
applications of new technologies in ways that are consistent with its
interests and values]{.underline}**.49 As a recent paper by Timmers put
it, "mastery of digital technologies is an essential capability for
future competitiveness, protecting society's values and bridging the
'sovereignty gap'."50 From this standpoint**, [the capacity for
technological innovation is also a major requirement for Europeans in
order to be able to make basic choices on their future economic and
social models]{.underline}**[, as opposed to living with the choices
made by those who drive innovation outside of Europe.]{.underline} For
example, [in 2018 the European Commission launched a series of
initiatives to shape a European 14 approach to AI, directed to not only
support technological development but also deal with the impact of AI on
labour markets, develop talents and skills, and shape a governance
framework for the multiple applications of this emerging
technology]{.underline}. [The Commission has established a High-Level
Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG), tasked with
supporting the evolution of the EU approach to the ethical,
socioeconomic and legal implications of AI. This Group delivered a
report on ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI in April 2019 and another
on policy and investment recommendations, including on a suitable
governance framework, in June 2019.51 These are the first steps in
shaping a distinct European approach to AI, which is essential both to
enable Europe's future competitiveness and to prevent dangerous uses of
this technology, such as for mass surveillance]{.underline}. According
to some estimates, the application of AI could raise global GDP by 14%,
or \$15,7 trillion, by 2030. In particular, the economic impact of AI
would lift China's GDP by 26%, that of North America by 14.5%, that of
Southern Europe by 11,5% and that of Northern Europe by 9,9%.52 [The EU
holds strong assets in facing the technological innovation challenge,
such as excellent research institutions, a wide pool of talent and a
large internal market.]{.underline} According to the Reuters' list of
the 100 most innovative universities in the world, 46 (and eight of the
top ten) are in the US, 27 in Europe and 23 in Asia.53 [However, there
is a need for urgent action in preserving and expanding these
assets]{.underline}. Europe has failed to meet the objective of spending
3% of its GDP on research and development (R&D), with investment at
around 2% (about the same share of GDP as in China) in 2017; compared to
4.2% in South Korea, 3.3% in Japan and 2.8% in the US.54 The competition
for global talent is in full swing between academic institutions and
corporate actors, while the Single Market is failing to deliver its full
potential, whether through larger access to venture capital or the free
flow of digital services. Besides, the EU is falling behind major
competitors in the US and China on various fronts of innovation.55 The
EU holds strong assets in facing the technological innovation challenge,
such as excellent research institutions, a wide pool of talent and a
large internal market. China is leading in setting the standards for 5G,
even though EU companies such as Nokia and Eriksson have a strong track
record too. Furthermore, China benefits from the largest domestic market
in the world, which will in turn generate massive volumes of data,
further empowering Chinese companies in the digital economy. Europe's
delay in the development of a competitive 5G industry implies that EU
countries will face problems concerning both the security of their
networks -- as the current controversy surrounding Huawei shows -- and
the control of the data generated by hyper-connected economies and
societies.56 These are both central requirements for strategic autonomy.
[**When it comes to AI, China and the US are leading in R&D** and host
the largest shares of high-value AI start-ups by far. The more advanced
AI is, the more performing the millions of devices connected through the
IoT will be. In 2018, the EU was home to 132 of the 500 most important
IoT companies in the world, while 236 were based in the US and 27 in
China.]{.underline}57 Low levels of venture capital are another major
obstacle. Despite growing quite fast in the last five years, venture
capital in Europe stood at only \$17.6 billion in 2017, against \$71.9
billion in the US and \$70.8 billion in Asia.58 Besides, the average
size of venture capital funds in Europe is €60 million -- half the US
average -- and they mostly operate within individual member states.59
The scarcity of growth funding for companies past the launch phase is
particularly problematic, as promising European digital start-ups are
often acquired by non-EU (mostly American) companies and funds[.
Supporting Europe's technological leadership and therefore strategic
autonomy will require decisive action at three levels]{.underline}:
Firstly, Europeans should decide what priorities to concentrate their
resources on, from fundamental research to the full innovation cycle. A
recent report by the High-level Strategy Group on Industrial
Technologies has updated a previous list of six "key enabling
technologies", defined as the essential technology building blocks
underpinning EU industrial leadership. The new entries on this list are
AI, digital security and connectivity.60 In parallel, the work of the
Strategic Forum for Important Projects of Common European Interest --
identifying and supporting strategic European value chains -- is one of
the vectors of Europe's fledgling industrial policy approach. Alongside
areas of ongoing cooperation on batteries, high-performance computers
and microelectronics, six additional areas have been selected for
pooling resources. q Secondly, larger resources must be available to
support innovation policies. 61 Member states will soon face a moment of
truth in the next phase of negotiations on the upcoming MFF, when they
will have to decide on the Commission's proposal to raise the share of
the budget dedicated to innovation, including Horizon 2020 (H2020), by
over 40%. While this is necessary, it will be equally important to
ensure that the EU and national funds and initiatives work hand in hand
to maximise impact. This will require better coordination between
national strategies concerning the major sectors of technological
innovation (e.g. AI), which are often developed in separate national
silos. There will also be a need to build on the pilot experience of the
European Innovation Council to target the most promising start-ups for
funding under H2020. Crucially, Europeans must devise tools to provide
more flexible financing to EU firms, particularly 15 high-potential
start-ups that struggle to move from the research phase to market
access. q [Thirdly**, the regulatory framework must be updated or even
established to enable the deployment and leveraging of new
technologies** and maximise the advantages of the Single Market, while
ensuring security and seeking to establish a level playing field with
external partners.]{.underline} As mentioned above, the EU's experience
with the regulation of the free flow of data is a case in point.
Besides, the AI HLEG's recent report fleshes out recommendations for a
European approach to the governance and regulation of this crucial set
of technologies. It calls for shaping regulation according to different
types and levels of risk, reviewing existing legislation across various
domains (from civil and criminal law to consumer protection and
competition), expanding institutional capacity and expertise and
fostering a Single Marker for trustworthy AI in Europe.62 Additionally,
building on the March 2019 Commission recommendations on the
cybersecurity of 5G networks63, a much stronger pan-European regime
should be established to ensure that all member states and providers
meet high security requirements.

//um-ef)

The **[geopolitical shifts]{.underline}** of the past four years **[have
caused many in Europe to value strategic self-determination and limiting
dependence on foreign powers]{.underline}**. In a March letter to von
der Leyen, four European leaders, including Germany's Angela Merkel,
articulated this desire: "**[We believe that Europe needs to recharge
and complement its current digitisation efforts with a self-determined
and open digital policy which includes digital
sovereignty]{.underline}** as leitmotif." The statement is notable for
several reasons: It abandons the phrase "cyber sovereignty" and its
evocations of Chinese and Russian internet control; **[positions Europe
as the exporter and not consumer of policy]{.underline}**; and
**[expresses a willingness for a European leadership role regarding
internet governance questions]{.underline}**. **[Europe might be the
first to set the rules of the online game]{.underline}**, but this alone
cannot win the game. Because the internet is founded on and continues to
create interdependencies between nations, eliminating dependence on
other countries is not just challenging but to some extent
contradictory. For instance, European Union privacy rules and limits on
cross-border data flows have necessitated the establishment of adequacy
decisions and other agreements to enable data to continue flowing across
borders. Interconnections and interdependencies between countries have
become pervasive and will relatively remain so in a globally
interoperable system. Given this limitation, **[Europe has focused on
regulation]{.underline}** and, over the past few years, has managed
**[to establish itself as the de facto global regulator for the
internet]{.underline}** on a number of issues. When it came into force
in 2018, the GDPR represented the world's most ambitious privacy
regulation. Its impact was felt globally, so much so that some 80
countries around the world have implemented GDPR-like statutes. The
recently released Digital Services Act package, which addresses rules
and responsibilities for online platforms and rules on competition
policy, **[continues the trend of European rule-making leading the way
internationally]{.underline}**. Meanwhile in Brussels, the digital
policy agenda is crowded with issues that range from online terrorism to
cybersecurity, data governance, and encryption. **[All this policy
activity has placed Europe at the heart of internet governance
discussions,]{.underline}** but not necessarily in a way that fully
satisfies either Europe or its allies. Regulation alone is not enough.
Many European observers have adopted the view that in order to be
competitive in the tech sector, Europe needs to invest in
infrastructure. In the past year alone, Europe has embarked on a series
of activities that hint at its wish to become an infrastructure pioneer,
while also building the legal framework to support it. GAIA-X, the
federated Franco-German cloud initiative is an example; proposals for a
European DNS---no matter how poorly thought out they are---are another.
In and of itself, building infrastructure is not bad: It could
contribute to increased innovation. But many key questions remain,
especially the feasibility of such grand ideas in practice. **[Europe's
main challenge is that it continues to be technologically dependent
on]{.underline}** both the **[United States]{.underline}** and China,
placing it in the middle of a technology conflict that will most likely
continue and may escalate. Europe faces two different dependency
hurdles. The first is its dependence on China. The EU's economic links
with China's tech sector are pervasive, and Chinese software and
hardware are used throughout the EU internet ecosystem. Europe knows
that China's cheap equipment and financial promises come with
attachments and tradeoffs that Europe is struggling to make in a
coordinated fashion. For example, Europe's indecisiveness and lack of a
harmonized strategy among its member states with regards to the
deployment of 5G equipment from Huawei, is a case in point. Germany and
other countries seem keen to continue some sort of collaboration with
China, albeit within limitations, whereas countries like Italy have
prevented national operators from making deals with Huawei. The second
dependency hurdle is with the United States. **[European policymakers
understand it is impossible to cut ties with America's digital companies
altogether. Instead, they are focused on how these companies should
behave within its borders]{.underline}**. **[By taking advantage of its
economic standing, Europe drafts regulation that aims to shape the
business models of big technology companies]{.underline}**. The impact
of this can be quite profound if one considers th**[e opportunities it
creates for Europe as a global regulator]{.underline}**. However,
**[this also raises a number of questions for cooperation with the
United States]{.underline}**. Wh**[en member states are focused on
regulation in ways that are still notably different from counterparts in
the United States, it begs the question of just what kinds and degrees
of internet strategy cooperation are most realistic for the U.S.-EU
relationship.]{.underline}** This approach seems to be paying off, but
not without hiccups. Europe's experimentation with regulation allows it
to set the agenda on complex internet governance questions. Despite its
unintended consequences, the GDPR continues to be the most influential
privacy regulation in the world. In contrast to the chaotic debate in
the United States over Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act,
the DSA at least provides some clarity on how regulators envision the
roles and responsibilities of online platforms. With both the DSA and
the GDPR, European policymakers have resisted regulation that aims to
make sweeping changes to the internet's core properties. But this is not
a guarantee for the future. As Europe becomes more inward looking, it
may push further in its approach to asserting a measure of online
sovereignty. Similar to other countries around the world, Europe is
facing some hard facts. The internet is becoming less---less global,
less interoperable, less open. The internet remains unable to resist the
centralization of economic power to a few big players and has become
increasingly weaponized through such activities as disinformation
campaigns. This type of behavior will most certainly intensify and, as
it does, Europe will need to make some crucial choices. What kind of an
Internet does it want? Sooner or later, the United States will face
inevitably the same dilemma. This is a point where both allies will
converge: recognizing that historically hands-off approaches to the
internet no longer suffice in an age of harmful company behavior,
internet insecurity, and authoritarian affronts on the open internet.
But, ultimately, **[the biggest obstacle for collaboration will be their
divergent views on how regulation should shape the internet: the United
States will most likely continue to insist on a market-based approach,
perhaps with some minimal interventions, while Europe will persist in a
more institutional-oriented process]{.underline}**. This schism will be
difficult to bridge because it is part of the countries' historical and
cultural background. **[Yet, it can also act as an opportunity.
Realizing this difference should encourage both actors to turn their
attention to the internet itself. Their common, shared goal can be to
rally behind the values that have defined the internet since its early
days: its architectural design]{.underline}**. The critical properties
of the internet can become the starting point and the shared
understanding in moving forward, regardless of which approach each
decides to follow. This would place both allies in stark contrast to
countries like China and Russia.

The EU: a geo-technology player in the making

In the last decade, **[the EU has]{.underline}** gradually **[woken up
to the geopolitical implications of digital tech]{.underline}**nologies.
This awakening can be linked to a series of events beginning in 2013
with the disclosures by former NSA employee Edward Snowden followed by
Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, the Brexit
referendum, the 2019 European Parliament election, and various EU member
states' national elections. The Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018
helped put the spotlight on big US technology companies and the need to
better regulate them. Similarly, the onset of international discussions
over the Chinese 5G provider Huawei that same year raised greater
awareness of EU technology vulnerabilities. In parallel to this, **[the
global impact of the EU's 2018 General Data Protection
Regulation]{.underline}** (GDPR), even if unexpected, **[turned the EU
into a global tech]{.underline}**nology **[actor and showed it the way
to leverage the attractiveness and power of its internal
market.]{.underline}** **[Equipped with]{.underline}** these
**[influential regulatory tools]{.underline}**, **[the EU is now seeking
to become the global leader in the regulation of digital
tech]{.underline}**nologies. EU digital legislation is no longer just
inward-looking. **[The union]{.underline}** now **[proactively seeks to
leverage its regulatory capacity and nurture digital partnerships and
alliances to globally project its values]{.underline}**. Building on
previous successes, **[the EU is now in the process of implementing
innovative regulatory regimes for AI,]{.underline}** **[data
governance]{.underline}**, **[and digital platforms that]{.underline}**,
like the GDPR, **[have the potential to go global.]{.underline}** This
**[new geopolitical logic underpins several new EU geo-technology
initiatives]{.underline}**. In the EU-US TTC, launched in 2021, the
union and the US are currently negotiating enhanced cooperation in
technology and standards development, digital regulation, connectivity
investments, and the security aspects of advanced technologies. The
swift and harmonised EU and US export controls on advanced technologies
imposed on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine in February this year
are the first success story of this new transatlantic technology
cooperation. Beyond the EU-US TTC, **[the EU has announced a new TTC

development investments in lower income countries with values-based
digital regulation and geopolitical thinking.]{.underline}** The
**[EU]{.underline}** has also **[taken steps to reduce its
tech]{.underline}**nological **[vulnerabilities and asymmetric
dependencies through investment in technological
capabilities]{.underline}**. These efforts have been heavily influenced
by China's technological assertiveness, the US-EU technology clashes
during the Trump administration, and most recently the Russian invasion
of Ukraine. Along these lines, **[the EU has developed new instruments
and cooperation mechanisms]{.underline}**, **[such as the Toolbox for 5G
security and the Joint Cyber Unit, to secure EU
cyberspace]{.underline}** To further strengthen its technological
capabilities and reduce its asymmetric dependencies, **[the union is
decisively investing in the development of critical
tech]{.underline}**nologies **[including semiconductors]{.underline}**,
through the European Chips Act; **[supercomputing]{.underline}**,
through the European High-Performance Computing Joint Undertaking;
**[and 6G development]{.underline}**, for example, through the Hexa-X
project. Moreover, **[the EU has rolled out a host of strategies
addressing issues at the nexus of digital tech]{.underline}**nology
**[and geopolitics]{.underline}**, **[including the 2030 Digital
Compass, the Strategic Compass, the Cybersecurity Strategy, and the
Standardisation Strategy]{.underline}**. The breadth of the issues
addressed in these various efforts underscore the ubiquity of
geo-technological dynamics across diverse policy fields. While the EU
was building its digital standing, Russia invaded Ukraine for the second
time. As so often, war became an accelerator of existing trends. Long
before Russia's invasion on 24 February, Ukraine had become ground zero
for Russian digital and hybrid warfare, with hundreds of thousands of
cyber-attacks and mass disinformation campaigns intended to destabilise
the country, undermine Ukraine's democratically elected government,
confuse Western public opinion, and ensure the global south will rally
around Russia. In its response to the war, the West has deployed massive
sanctions on advanced technologies with the intention of paralysing
Russia's industrial base and weakening its military capabilities. And
while the Kremlin has prohibited and blocked several foreign digital
platforms in Russia to impede the flow of outside information into the
country, many other Western technology companies independently decided
to cease operating in Russia. Both developments foreshadow a new digital
iron curtain. The **[war in Ukraine has]{.underline}** already
**[demonstrated that digital tech]{.underline}**nologies now **[shape
the response to international conflict.]{.underline}** The legislative
and policy measures taken so far by the EU are commendable. However,
there is still much to do. The EU continues to be a technology research
powerhouse, but its success in the commercialisation and the securing of
significant market shares in digital technologies has been limited.
Today, Europe is lagging in the development of advanced technologies
including semiconductors, AI, and cloud and high-performance computing.
As the EU rolls out initiative after initiative, a cohesive strategy is
missing to tie these measures together to improve coordination, set
priorities, and identify gaps. Due to a lack of information, resources,
and engagement the union is currently not realising its full potential
-- and not reaping the full geopolitical benefits of its digital policy
efforts. Because such an overarching framework is lacking, important
information is not flowing between the relevant Brussels and member
state institutions and towards the EU delegations around the world that
play a crucial role in forwarding European digital foreign policy
interests. Both the European Commission and the member states have
identified these challenges. The commission's 2030 Digital Compass,
approved in March 2020, said that the EU needs a "comprehensive and
coordinated approach to digital coalition-building and diplomatic
outreach". This is a position shared by the member states, which at the
12 July 2021 Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) called for the EU high
representative and vice president (HRVP) and the commission "to
formulate a comprehensive, ambitious European external digital policy in
coherence with existing internal policies". The diagnosis is clear. If
the EU wants to become a global technology actor, it must develop and
deploy digital diplomacy tools. The next three sections spell out in
detail how to deliver on this mandate and propose a policy approach
along three dimensions: values, security, and markets. More precisely,
they lay out a path: 1. to promote a human rights-focused and
rules-based global technological order; 2. to secure the EU, its
partners, and other like-minded countries in the analogical and digital
worlds; 3. to promote fair, open, sustainable, and inclusive digital
markets.

**[Stronger EU = stronger NATO]{.underline}**

Those words dovetailed with Fries' assertation that: "**[By getting
stronger, the EU will be a better partner for NATO. It is a mutually
reinforcing partnership]{.underline}**."

**[Among the wide range of government and international officials,
military commanders, private sector players and independent
experts]{.underline}** who participated in the 4.5-hour event, **[there
was consensus that a fast-evolving range of threats showed the need for
NATO and the EU to work]{.underline}** closely **[together, and for
Europeans to strengthen their security capabilities to the benefit of
both organisations.]{.underline}**

As the summit was taking place, that need was emphasised by the Russian
troop build-up on Ukraine's eastern border prompting fears of a new
invasion, as well as the standoff on the EU's frontier with Belarus
where the regime of President Alexander Lukashenko despatched thousands
of migrants from the Middle East in what Western nations have denounced
as an attempt to divide the EU and destabilise the region.

"When we look at what is unfolding on the borders of Poland, Latvia and
Lithuania that are faced with a brutal hybrid attack by the Lukashenko
regime, every day we see that sending a sign of us being united is
important but, more importantly, we also see a clear need for NATO and
EU cooperation to respond effectively to the sort of crisis that we are
seeing," said Kadi Silde, Undersecretary for Defence Policy at the
Estonian Ministry of Defence.

"**[Adversaries don't just pick military tools or civilian tools, they
pick a mix of tools and we in the West need to adapt ourselves to this
sort of challenges]{.underline}**," she added. "**[Expanding and
strengthening and deepening EU-NATO cooperation is the way to
go."]{.underline}**

As it turns 70 this week, **[the Atlantic alliance has no shortage of
champions in Washington, even if it lacks one in the Oval Office. Yet,
the [focus on NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**---the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization---**[alone [can be misleading]{.mark} by magnifying the
importance of the defense alliance in the European project. In reality,
[the trans-Atlantic community has relied on]{.mark} two pillars: a
successful defensive alliance and an even more [successful]{.mark}
project of [European integration]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Americans who
are truly committed to the idea of a Europe "whole and free" should
realize that **[[NATO is no longer the main spinal cord]{.mark} of the
European project; the European Union is.]{.underline}** When George H.
W. Bush coined the phrase in 1989, the level of intra-European
integration was arguably on par with the defense alliance as providing
stability and prosperity to the continent, and Americans were still
heavily involved in both. Remember, this was pre-Maastricht Treaty,
before the EU itself. Three decades of political, economic, and monetary
integration later---and 16 new members later---the European Union is
deeply entrenched in the lives of Europeans. Today, 28 European
democracies, which used to compete among themselves and sometimes fight
to their ultimate demise, now choose to pool sovereignty and have their
interests communally discussed and collectively defended. **[[The EU is
a power multiplier: Every one of the 28 has a stronger]{.mark}
individual [voice]{.mark} because they stand together in the European
Union. [Small]{.mark} European [countries]{.mark}, whose geography and
demography would force them to cave to stronger neighbors, [can]{.mark}
now [count on]{.mark} the [solidarity]{.mark} of the
group]{.underline}**---as illustrated by the unwavering support for
Ireland by the other 26 member states and the Brussels institutions in
the Brexit negotiations. **[The neighbors of the European Union are no
fools. Those who seek prosperity and stability hope to join the EU club.
[Those who reject the model]{.mark} set by the West and liberal
democracies [feel threatened by the]{.mark} European [Union]{.mark}---it
is the prospect of Ukraine moving into the EU's orbit through an
Association Agreement that triggered Russia's hostility and ultimate
aggression, not NATO. [The power of attraction]{.mark} of the European
Union, at least [as much as]{.mark} the security guarantees of [NATO,
has helped stabilize Eastern Europe]{.mark}. Despite these realities,
[Americans often indulge in a scornful disregard for the
EU]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Recently, benign contempt has taken an ugly
turn. Since taking office, President Trump and his administration have
attacked the European Union and individual member states repeatedly,
with near impunity. At first sight, American complaints appear to be
centered on the issue of Europe's trading power, which rivals that of
the United States. For Donald Trump, the EU was created to "take
advantage of" the United States and it is "worse than China." Early in
his mandate, the American president pushed for tariffs on steel and
aluminum and threatened to go after automobiles, until a meeting with EU
Commission President Juncker put a brake on the downward spiral.
However, a deeper look reveals a fundamental ideological contention: The
brand of nationalism and populism that defines this administration
stands in direct contradiction with the very existence of a liberal,
supra-national body such as the European Union. As laid out by the State
Department's Director of Policy Planning Kiron Skinner in December 2018,
the administration holds the view that "international institutions have
steadily encroached on the rights of sovereign nations" and that
"nothing can replace the nation-state as the guarantor of democratic
freedoms and national interests"---an indictment of the EU's very
existence. The ideological clash is reminiscent of older times.
Addressing a crowd in Warsaw in July 2017, President Trump likened the
European Union to the Soviet Union, criticizing a similar "steady creep
of government bureaucracy that drains the vitality and wealth of the
people," an equivalency popular in conservative circles. Similarly,
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo suggested in a December 2018 speech in
Brussels that EU bureaucrats were not really working for the interests
of European citizens. By making no secret of his personal support for
euroskeptic forces, Donald Trump has become an active political opponent
of the European Union in its existing form. He celebrated the Brexit
vote, expressed support for far-right candidate Marine Le Pen ahead of
the French presidential elections, disparaged Angela Merkel repeatedly,
and appeared to rejoice at the Yellow Vests protest movement. He
criticized Theresa May for negotiating a "soft" Brexit, and even
recommended to Emmanuel Macron that France leave the EU. The American
president has nominated ambassadors famously critical of the EU, and his
administration demoted the EU ambassador's status without notification,
before reversing under criticism. **[As]{.underline}** Donald **[Trump
torments both the Atlantic alliance and the European Union, all rush to
NATO's bedside, and few worry about the EU. Truthfully, Atlanticists
love to love NATO. It stands for values, valor, unity, solidarity. NATO
won the Cold War. Celebrating NATO is celebrating the military. It is
much harder to love the EU, the bureaucracy, the politics, the
regulations. The EU lacks democratic appeal, and its slow-moving
decisionmaking process create many frustrations.]{.underline}** Unlike
in NATO, the United States sits on the sidelines, it does not control
who enters, or who stays in. The EU is also an economic peer competitor,
a tough trading partner, and a sovereign international actor, at times
non-compliant with American demands. **[Yet, the prospect of an
[implosion of the E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion [should be as]{.mark}
unbearable and [intolerable]{.mark} to an American audience [as the
dissolution of NATO]{.mark}---or more so, as no one wants to see the
demons of nationalism back on the European continent, along with a
global economic catastrophe.]{.underline}** Benign neglect is
counterproductive; but a policy openly hostile to the European Union is
a grave mistake. In a world where the strongmen are striking back,
Americans should not forget that the European Union stands with the
United States when it matters most. The NATO summit in Washington this
week should be the occasion to recall not only the utmost importance of
the Atlantic alliance to trans-Atlantic security, but also the crucial
contribution of the European Union to peace, unity, and ultimately
security for Europe and beyond.

#### EU defense cooperation is critical to NATO's effectiveness

**Garamone 17** -- (Jim, "NATO Secretary General Stresses Change,

**[[NATO is evolving and adapting]{.mark} to changing times, [and part
of that evolution must involve the E]{.mark}uropean
[U]{.mark}nion]{.underline}**, the alliance secretary general said at
the French Ecole Militaire yesterday. Jens Stoltenberg told students at
the illustrious university in Paris that NATO has proven its ability to
evolve to face changing threats. "Our history has taught us that [[our
ability to]{.mark} [adapt is crucial to our
success]{.mark}]{.underline}," the secretary general said. "[Again and
again, faced with a changing world, the alliance has evolved." The
alliance formed to combat the Soviet Union]{.underline} and ensure
Western Europe's freedom and independence. It evolved when the Berlin
Wall fell in 1989 and the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. [It evolved
again with the al-Qaida attacks on 9/11,]{.underline} with NATO taking a
lead role in Afghanistan. Three years ago, [the alliance had to change
again when Russia illegally annexed Crimea]{.underline} \-- the only
time since World War II that a European country has seized part of
another by force. And in the Middle East, the Islamic State of Iraq and
Syria captured Mosul and Raqqa, and declared those cities as parts of
its so-called caliphate. "As a result, [[NATO has to both strengthen our
collective defense at home and manage crises beyond our
borders]{.underline}]{.mark}," Stoltenberg said. Deter, Defend [In
Europe, NATO allies "have implemented the largest reinforcement of our
deterrence and defense since the Cold War]{.underline}," he said. [The
NATO Response Force tripled to 40,000 troops, including a high-readiness
force, ready to move within days]{.underline}. The alliance also stepped
up military exercises and enhanced air policing in the Baltic and Black
Sea regions. "We have deployed almost 5,000 troops in four multinational
battle groups to the east of the alliance," he said. Those battle groups
are in Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania and Poland. And the allies are
continuing to increase defense spending, he said. "[NATO's actions are
defensive, proportionate and in line with our international
commitments]{.underline}," the secretary general said. "Our aim is not
to provoke conflict, but to prevent conflict. We don't want a new Cold
War, and we don't want a new arms race." Russia is a neighbor and the
alliance approach to Russia combines strong defense with meaningful
dialogue. But Russia is only one problem that must be dealt with. "Since
9/11, NATO allies have stood together in solidarity against terrorism,"
Stoltenberg said. "In Afghanistan we have transitioned from combat
operations, to the training and advising of local Afghan forces. But we
are now increasing the number of troops serving in our mission to 16,000
NATO soldiers in the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan." The
alliance is also a full partner of the global coalition to defeat ISIS.
NATO assets \-- such as the AWACS capability \-- and NATO expertise are
on display throughout Iraq, the rest of the Middle East and North
Africa. NATO Stronger With EU "[[NATO is strengthening its collective
defense and,]{.mark} at the same time, [projecting stability]{.mark} in
its neighborhood]{.underline}," Stoltenberg said. "**[[Both of those are
more effective when NATO and the E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion [work
togethe]{.mark}r."]{.underline}** Stoltenberg had one big statistic to
back up his claim: [About 94 percent of the EU's population lives in a
NATO member nation]{.underline}. [Talks continue and the two alliances
have made progress. "We have boosted our cooperation on cyber defense,
maritime security, fighting terrorism and countering hybrid
warfare]{.underline}, among many other things," the secretary general
said. "**[[Neither]{.mark} [NATO nor the E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion
[have all the tools to tackle the challenges alone]{.mark}, but together
we are a formidable force for good."]{.underline}** He called on France,
a founding member of both NATO and the EU, to play a key role to ensure
the coherence of these efforts. "[I am convinced [a strong European
defense is good for the E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion, it is good for
Europe [and]{.mark} it is good for [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}, as long
as it respects three key principles," he said. Build, Strengthen,
Compliment **[The first is to [build]{.mark} the [necessary
capabilities]{.mark}: [spend]{.mark}ing [more]{.mark} and spending
better.]{.underline}** T[hat means tackling the fragmentation of the
European defense industry.]{.underline} "The U.S. has one type of main
battle tank, while Europe has 17 different types," he said. "The U.S.
has four types of frigates and destroyers; Europe has 29. The U.S. has
six types of fighter planes; Europe has 20." He does not want to
eliminate competition, but he does want to see some coherence,
interoperability and cost savings in the process. "Second, a stronger
European defense also needs to involve non-EU allies to the fullest
possible extent, of course respecting the autonomy and integrity of the
European Union," he said. Stoltenberg said nations on both sides of the
Atlantic continue to be engaged in European security. "For the first
time in years, the United States and Canada are increasing their
military presence on our continent," he said. "And, after Brexit, non-EU
allies will account for 80 percent of NATO defense spending, and three
of the four battle groups in the eastern part of the alliance will be
led by non-EU allies." [There is no way the EU can replace NATO, he
said, but it could strengthen the European pillar of the
alliance.]{.underline} Finally, [[a]{.mark} [stronger European defense
needs to compliment]{.mark}, not duplicate, [NATO's]{.mark} own
[efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}. "On duplications, for instance, [NATO
already has a well-established defense planning process]{.underline},"
Stoltenberg said. "[We've had it for decades, and as part of that
process, we identify in detail the capabilities that each ally needs to
deliver to ensure the alliance has the tools it needs to do its
job]{.underline}. [It would be a mistake for the EU to duplicate that
process.]{.underline} Capitals should not be faced with two conflicting
lists for capability requirements." "[We share 22 members, so to compete
would be like competing with ourselves]{.underline}," he continued.
["That makes no sense. Our roles are distinct but mutually reinforcing.
[We must work together]{.mark} in a coherent way."]{.underline}

**[Much of the traditional American reserve toward European strategic
autonomy has emanated from a concern that it would be EU-centric and
would undermine NATO without actually creating any robust, effective EU
alternative]{.underline}**. Judging by recent statements from some
American officials, this concern persists. **[It is misplaced, for a
number of reasons. First, Western [security]{.mark} simply [requires a
stronger European component]{.mark}, and the question of whether that
component wears an EU or a NATO hat is tertiary.]{.underline}** Indeed,
because of the overlap between EU and NATO membership, there is no
reason it could not be dual-hatted. **[It would be [far better]{.mark},
especially [for Washington, to have EU-centric security arrangements
that could handle a]{.mark} Balkan [crisis than]{.mark} to have [an
impotent NATO-centric Europe that relied completely on the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [for all hard-security]{.mark} measures.
Second, [European strategic autonomy could hardly undermine NATO more
than]{.mark} the [resentments engendered by the current
imbalance]{.mark} in capabilities and political will. Third, if the
Europeans manage to wreck NATO without creating any capable alternative,
it is they, not the United States, who will bear the
consequences.]{.underline}** Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** seems to
grasp these considerations, and for all his bluster and seeming
hostility toward America's European allies, he **[is instinctively the
greatest friend of European strategic autonomy ever to sit in the White
House.]{.underline}**

**[The rise of Trump prompted the intriguing idea of proclaiming Angela
Merkel as the new leader of the Free World. Realistically, however,
Germany's atrophied military capabilities make such a suggestion
risible. I remember some 15 years ago hearing Germany described as the
Sick Man of NATO. Well, the patient hasn't shown any improvement in the
interim.]{.underline}** In the absence of German/European strategic
autonomy, Merkel's devotees might aspire at best to elevate her to the
leadership of some postmodern fantasyland devoid of hard-security
challenges. Unfortunately, the real-life Europe---with an assertive
Russia, unstable borderlands, disruptive immigration, and
terrorism---bears little resemblance to such a vision. Moreover, **[with
the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, selfless German multilateralism is very much
taking a back seat to German economic interests, at the cost of
seriously undermining both the economy and security of Ukraine and
Germany's easternmost EU partners.]{.underline}** "Germany First" might
not be the slogan, but at least as far as Nord Stream 2 is concerned, it
is the reality.

In fact, **[the Free World would be best served not by having a leader
at all, but by having a partnership. It need not be a fully equal
partnership with respect to every facet of security, but [something must
replace the current relationship of radical]{.mark} disproportion and
[dependency]{.mark}, which is both corrosive and unsustainable. Instead
of the United States taking the lead on European security and relying on
its European allies as a force multiplier, we need to see Europeans
safeguarding European security and calling on the United States as a
force multiplier]{.underline}**. We must dispense with the pernicious
American conceit that Europeans cannot be trusted to manage their own
security, and we must rid ourselves of the pernicious European illusion
that Europeans need not be bothered to manage their own security. If
Donald Trump manages to push us in this direction, he will have earned a
hallowed place in Euroatlantic history.

What Europe needs to do ECFR has put forward recommendations on how to
address all these sources of vulnerability, from 5G and undersea cables
to military AI. T[he EU needs to improve its data sovereignty by
adopting strict reg]{.underline}ulation[s on data privacy and ensuring
that these are exported to countries and companies that access
Europeans' data.]{.underline} EU member states should create an
ecosystem in which smaller 5G players that focus on software and
virtualisation can scale up their operations and cooperate effectively
with larger European and US companies. The [EU should heavily invest in
**exporting tech**nologies and practices that protect democracy and help
achieve technological sovereignty, and in learning from others'
experiences in this realm. But more important]{.underline} than these
individual fixes [is deeper engagement with the external implications
and geopolitical power elements of tech]{.underline}nology. [This
engagement has an external element of reaching out to partners and an
internal element of ensuring close cooperation between the **EU** and
its **member states.**]{.underline} Outreach to partners The [EU needs a
global strategy for improving its partners' access to reliable and safe
tech]{.underline}nology. Otherwise, [the bloc will leave a space that
others will fill]{.underline}. Democracies would be further weakened and
impoverished. **[Autocracies would thrive]{.underline}**. Europe would
be wrong if it thought it could set out its own rules and standards and
let the rest of the world adapt. The Brussels effect, by which Europe
silently exported its data privacy regulation to the rest of the world,
will not easily repeat itself. GDPR happened when technology was still
under the geopolitical radar. Now, [tech]{.underline}nology [has been
(geo)politicised and both governments and industry actors know how
closely intertwined power, technology, and regulation are. **Both China
and the US are reaching out to third countries**]{.underline}. The US
has programmes such as The Clean Network, which aims to help its allies
end their use of Chinese 5G. The Chinese Belt and Road Initiative
includes a digital component. And Chinese firms, with governmental
support, export facial recognition and surveillance techniques to
autocracies around the world. The **[challenge for the EU is in working
with like-minded countries and multilateral bodies]{.underline}** --
such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD), but also regional arrangements such as those in Latin America,
Africa, and the Indo-Pacific -- to develop fair, open, and values-driven
technological standards. T[he EU should deploy the incentive of access
to its digital market to strengthen its alliances.]{.underline} [The
bloc should use its financial institutions to incentivise EU firms to
invest in countries that are seeking to adopt these critical
technologies but, at the same time, want to **reduce** their
technological **dependence** on China]{.underline}. The [EU
should]{.underline} also consider [establish]{.underline}ing [a
comprehensive and compelling tech package that would allow it to become
a **geopolitical** player in the area.]{.underline} This 'tech compact'
should include: upgrading existing or prospective trade agreements to
grant improved access to the EU digital services market to countries
that comply with EU standards in areas such as data flows, privacy, and
AI; offering technical assistance to governments and parliaments wishing
to align with the EU on regulatory issues; offering funding guarantees
for connectivity investments; coordinating positions on technical
standards in multilateral organisations; and offering cyber security and
democracy-protection packages. In contrast to other great powers, whose
tech offers are often based on coercion and the exploitation of
weakness, [the EU should stand for a principled approach based on
**partnerships**, **mutual interests**, **consent**, and
**solidarity**]{.underline}. Also, as it is already doing, the [EU
should continue scanning its internal market for vulnerabilities in
critical tech]{.underline}nological [sectors, identifying high-risk
vendors, and ensuring reciprocity in market access to these technologies
for countries that restrict or curtail digital trade. **It will not be
sufficient for the EU to merely approve internal regulations in the
expectation that others will accept them**]{.underline}, such as in the
case of the GDPR. For example, the bloc is already operating on
bilateral agreements with like-minded countries such as Japan to
implement data privacy clauses that ensure the free and safe flow of
data. But this is not enough in itself. [The EU should aim]{.underline}
higher -- through multilateral institutions such as the OECD and the
International Monetary Fund, or through groupings such as the G20 -- [to
establish a global data privacy regime whose standards are valid
for]{.underline} most democracies, if not for **[all
countries]{.underline}** (as those ruled by authoritarian regimes may
opt out). A key component of this is the transatlantic relationship. A
major agreement on data privacy with the US would help break the current
dynamic of regulatory fragmentation, helping both the country and the EU
jointly take on China and other illiberal regimes. The importance of
cooperation between the EU and its member states The European Commission
and other Brussels institutions are positioning the EU as a powerful
actor in the global debates about tech regulation. But not all member
states appear to feel the same sense of urgency. As of today, 21 member
states have now published AI policy documents in which they identify
areas of focus, develop recommendations, and decide funding priorities.
These strategies reveal that most EU member states primarily see AI
through an economic lens. Almost all the strategies were written by or
under the leadership of economics ministries (or variations thereof) or,
less often, ministries of innovation. With very few exceptions -- such
as France -- most EU countries do not engage with the challenges posed
by the way that the development and use of AI might affect the
international balance of power. Even fewer discuss or even mention the
impact of AI on defence. If the EU moves forward on technology issues
without the support of its member states, it risks losing credibility
and the capability to influence others. Worse, it could leave empty
spaces in Europe that external actors fill. But, if the EU and its
member states work together closely on technology issues, the bloc will
be strengthened -- and will lead by showing that its rules and
regulations, such as those on privacy or trustworthy AI, work at home.
In this, the EU can benefit from member states' diplomatic reach in
various regions. [It is crucial for Europe to recognise and consider the
international second- and third-order effects of any actions it takes in
the tech]{.underline}nological [space]{.underline}. I[t needs to
acknowledge that these actions have an **impact** on its geopolitical
power.]{.underline} They influence the EU's soft power as a role model,
its positioning relative to other major players' plans, and its
geopolitical room for manoeuvre.

//CHC-DS 🐱‍👤

Earlier this year, **[Denmark became one of the first countries in the
world to release a tech diplomacy strategy]{.underline}**. The strategy
comes **[at a time when governments across the world are clashing with
"Big Tech."]{.underline}** On the one hand, **[democratic governments
are seeking to mitigate the threat that digital technologies pose to the
fabric of their societies, as the EU's announcement of its Digital
Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA)
demonstrates]{.underline}**. On the other, authoritarian governments
like Russia and China are further cracking down on tech companies and
using digital surveillance tools to limit opposition voices and further
cement their rule. The coming years will be critical to define global
rules and norms on digital speech, surveillance, internet governance,
the digital economy, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), among other
issues. To ensure a leading role in this effort, the United States
should develop its own tech diplomacy strategy. This strategy should
include the appointment of a U.S. tech ambassador at large and should be
centered on close transatlantic cooperation.

The rise of TechPlomacy Recent events have demonstrated the need for a
comprehensive Technology Diplomacy Strategy. From reports that several
U.S. social media companies took down posts of government critics in
India, to the Burmese military's use of Facebook to incite ethnic
violence, the power of digital technologies and the companies that
control them is increasingly a cause for concern. **[The Danish
government has]{.underline}** **[led the field in making]{.underline}**
**[technology policy]{.underline}** **[a core diplomatic
objective]{.underline}**. In 2017, **[it became the first country in the
world to appoint a tech ambassador, with offices in Silicon Valley,
Brussels, and Beijing --- three regional hubs that are already shaping
the international technology order]{.underline}**, albeit in different
ways. Unlike traditional diplomats, **[the ambassador's work is not
limited to one country or international organization, but on issues that
connect tech hubs globally.]{.underline}**

**[In its tech diplomacy strategy, Denmark outlines its efforts to
achieve "a more just, democratic and safe technological future." The
strategy rests on three pillars --- responsibility, democracy, and
security --- and charts Denmark's priorities on issues including digital
taxation and the digital economy, data privacy, social media influence
operations, and cybersecurity.]{.underline}** The call for tech
ambassadors is not new. Others have pointed out that the **[leading tech
companies possess "country-like" powers that warrant high-level
diplomatic attention. And about a dozen countries have already followed
Denmark's model and appointed tech ambassadors]{.underline}**. So far,
the United States has not followed suit.

But the appointment of a U.S. tech ambassador is not an end in itself.
It should be part of a comprehensive tech diplomacy strategy that
provides a roadmap for how a U.S. tech ambassador would engage with tech
companies and other governments to shape the global technology order
according to U.S. interests and values. What should define a U.S. tech
diplomacy strategy? First, the strategy should be comprehensive. It
should outline the United States' objectives on key emerging technology
issues ranging from 5G, AI, cybersecurity, data protection and privacy,
and digital surveillance. All of these issues are interconnected, but
current U.S. government efforts to address them are too
compartmentalized. For example, the State Department's Office of the
Coordinator for Cyber Issues primarily deals with cybersecurity and does
not address how these issues interact with AI and privacy. Similarly,
the Global Engagement Center leads the government's response to (online)
disinformation but does not deal with the tech policy issues driving the
spread of disinformation. The proposed, bipartisan Cyber Diplomacy Act
seeks to reorganize the State Department's cyber office and to elevate
its head to the level of an ambassador. This recommendation is a good
starting point, but this new post should be a U.S. tech ambassador at
large who holds responsibilities that extend beyond cybersecurity, and
who coordinates with other initiatives such as the National Artificial
Intelligence Initiative Office, launched by the Trump administration.
U.S. presidents have appointed ambassadors at large for a number of
issues in the past. These ambassadors are not stationed in a specific
country but rather represent the U.S. government on specific issues that
transcend national boundaries --- there are currently ambassadors at
large on global women's issues and international religious freedom, for
example. Second, a U.S. tech diplomacy strategy should focus on
transatlantic cooperation. **[The EU is already pressing ahead to set
global technology standards, including through the DSA and the DMA and
its recently published AI strategy, and several EU member states,
including France, have now prepared digital or technology
strategies]{.underline}**. If the United States wants to help set the
global tech agenda, it should closely cooperate with the EU. A good
start would be to accept the EU's invitation to join an EU-U.S.
Technology Council, where a U.S. tech ambassador would take a leading
role. **[Close cooperation with the EU would also ensure that standards
for the use of emerging technologies are grounded in democratic, rather
than authoritarian values.]{.underline}**

Ethical acceptability: Defining shared principles for human-centric
artificial intelligence in the military

Human agency as a central issue in responsible military use of
artificial intelligence

[AI raises]{.underline} many [different ethical issues that are relevant
in]{.underline} both the [civilian and military sectors]{.underline}.
These [issues range from]{.underline} [how data serving the development
and training of AI systems is **sourced**]{.underline}, [**used** and
**protected**]{.underline}, to the [**biases** and **assumptions** that
appear in AI programming]{.underline}, to the [potentially
**dehumanizing** effect of reducing the real world to data
points]{.underline}, to the [consequences of **non-transparent** or
inexplicable decision making for **accountability** and
**responsibility**]{.underline}.50 Many of [these issues feed into a
higher-level discussion on how AI is challenging human
agency.]{.underline} In this regard, the [EU member states seem to
**already agree** on the fundamental premise that human
agency]{.underline}---be it [in the civilian or military
sector]{.underline}---[is necessary for responsible use of
AI]{.underline}. [Finland is one EU member]{.underline} state [that has
given this issue a lot of thought]{.underline}. In its submission to the
GGE on LAWS 2020 it stated, for example, that 'the easier an advanced
technology is to apply, the easier it will be to use it for harmful
purposes. [In the future]{.underline}, [we might]{.underline} well [see
armed autonomous]{.underline} civilian [capabilities used for military
purposes']{.underline}, [arguing for the necessity of establishing a
framework for human involvement]{.underline}.51 AI should remain a tool
for humans to make decisions, and it should not strip humans of their
obligation and ability to do so. That principle is a cornerstone of the
strategy of the European Commission on 'human-centric AI'.52 Members of
the European Parliament also agreed in 2018 that the litmus test for
determining if an autonomous weapon would be acceptable is whether it
remains under 'meaningful human control'.53 In the context of the GGE's
debate on LAWS, [EU members states]{.underline} also
[support]{.underline}ed **[the adoption of the guiding principle which
states that 'human responsibility for the decision on the use of force
must be retained']{.underline}** (see box 2.1).54 Many of the [EU states
have made]{.underline} [the concept of **human control** a pivotal point
of their national position in the debate on LAWS]{.underline}, such as
Germany that has stated for instance that 'no weapons system may, on the
strength of its algorithms, entail the risk of overriding a human
de-activation command' (see figure 3.3).55 While EU members agree that
meaningful human control should be maintained throughout the entire life
cycle of the weapon, the question of how human agency needs to be
exercised in practice, however, remains unresolved.56 While some
proposals have been made in the context of the discussion of GGE on
LAWS, they are limited in scope as they do not have the intent to guide
other possible military uses of AI, from logistic and maintenance to
mission planning, training and recruitment of personnel.57 The [general
principles and recommendations laid out by the AI HLEG
could]{.underline}, in this regard, [provide a useful baseline to think
about how human-centred AI could look like in the military sector,
beyond]{.underline} the sole case of [LAWS]{.underline}. [EU member
states]{.underline} would [have a lot to gain from engaging in an
**intra-European** expert discussion on human control]{.underline}.
First, on the issue of legal compliance for example, [it would allow
them to **discuss**, **deepen**, **align** or, at least, **remove** the
**potential for conflict** in their reflections on the case of
LAWS]{.underline}. Second, it [would allow them to find a clear
direction and to determine their limits in developing collaborative
defence acquisition projects.]{.underline} Fostering intra-European
[discussion on human-centred artificial intelligence in the military
Deliberations on human-centred AI in the military could take place in
different forums at the same time.]{.underline} The choice of forum
should be guided by concrete political aims. The Council of the EU
already has a number of preparatory bodies that would allow delegates
from member states to coordinate their views on human control in
relation to discussion on LAWS at the UN in Geneva, namely, CONOP, CODUN
and EUMCWG. The regular meeting of these bodies provides an opportunity
for the EU External Action Service to identify the current common
position of EU member states on this issue. The meetings, however, are
meant to cover a wide range of topics every time, which limit the
possibility for states to discuss topics at a very granular level. It
[could be meaningful]{.underline} in that regard [to organize a series
of extra meetings specifically dedicated to the issue of human
control]{.underline}. When it comes to developing more general political
guidelines or technical standards for the development of joint defence
acquisition or capability development projects involving AI, then the
EDA and the European Commission could both play a role. [EU member
states could task the EDA to coordinate an expert reflection on
human-centred AI for defence, which would require **technical**,
**military** and **arms control experts**.]{.underline} Such an
initiative would need to connect with both the work on human-centred AI
in the civilian sector and with the discussion on human control within
arms control forums. The [European Commission could utilize the EDF to
support multidisciplinary research projects that would explore issues
around human control at a more technical level and feed into the
development of AI systems that can be deployed responsibly]{.underline}
It would also be valuable if EU member states could engage in the issue
at a higher political level and grapple with more fundamental ethical
and political issues. Such a discussion could take place in the context
of an ad hoc expert group of the European Parliament and directly at the
level of the ministers of foreign affairs and defence and the EU High
Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy at
the European Council.

(**[[EU]{.underline}]{.mark}**), or international bodies like the United

discussions on the military governance of AI.10 Without expanding on the
role of these other stakeholders, this chapter begins to explore
pressing questions for NATO and international relations scholars that
illustrate NATO's role in AI governance, which has not had a

addresses the top five myths circulated by Russian propaganda regarding
NATO's connection with and reaction to the spread of COVID-19.62 Also
established by NATO --- but operationally independent --- the StratCom
Center of Excellence (COE) in Riga, Latvia brings together civilian and
military stakeholders to conduct research on the use of modern
technologies and to develop virtual tools for analyses, research, and
decisionmaking. Hence, the center has produced valuable material for
NATO's Public Diplomacy Division. In addition, the StratCom COE has
worked with the EEAS StratCom task force to train EU staff on how to
respond to simulated disinformation attacks and responses. More
recently, in 2019, the EU and NATO started exchanging information
through the inclusion of NATO's international staff in the EU Rapid
Alert System, as well as through dialogues, staff and information
exchanges and training exercises, including briefings between the EEAS
StratCom and NATO Public Diplomacy Division.63 **[These are important
efforts that highlight NATO and the EU's openness to dialogue and mutual
learning experiences]{.underline}**. **[But they are nowhere near enough
to keep up with the network of disinformation, where techniques are
rapidly evolving and taking advantage of artificial
intelligence]{.underline}**. While China and Russia are reinforcing each
other's narratives through multiple channels, the effects of malign
foreign influence in the disinformation domain are now being compounded
by homegrown disinformation networks using the same pattern of
exploiting people's fear and vulnerability. Evidence of this occurring
includes the spread of anti-vaccination propaganda as well as
antidemocratic propaganda (which helped spur the assault on the U.S.
Capitol in January 2021).64 **[Given the growing vulnerabilities in the
trans-Atlantic space, NATO and the EU should join forces and expand
their activity from countering disinformation to a preventing
effort]{.underline}**. **[The EU can add value in increasing the
involvement of the private sector]{.underline}**, and NATO can add value
in using its intelligence capabilities in the counterterrorism domain to
identify troll factories and disinformation sources. **[More broadly on
cyber]{.underline}**, despite advancements in their own jurisdictions,
the **[paths of NATO and the EU have not crossed much
yet]{.underline}**. The two organizations have a different approach to
cyber issues: While the EU aims to develop resilience against cyber
threats, NATO has a broader and forward-looking approach that aims to
prevent cyberattacks and to use cyber as an offensive tool to tackle
threats and create deterrence.65 For example, the EU is seeking to
strengthen its cyber posture through an EU Cybersecurity Strategy. The
first piece of corresponding legislation, the EU Network and Information
Security Directive (EU 2016/1148), established substantial cybersecurity
standards that member states must adopt to protect critical sectors.66
Meanwhile, in its latest summit communiqué, NATO stated that "a decision
as to when a cyber-attack would lead to the invocation of Article 5
would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis,"
thus highlighting the increased awareness of the security implication of
cyberattacks on critical infrastructure.67 Despite their different
approaches, **[both NATO and the EU included cyber in their 2016
cooperation frameworks and started a series of joint exercises between
the EU's 2017 Parallel and Coordinated Exercise and NATO's 2017 Crisis
Management Exercise, as well as more recent exercises like those
conducted through the CYBERSEC 2019 forum]{.underline}**.68 **[However,
while incredibly valuable, such exercises have not gone much beyond
staffto-staff interactions and joint workshops.]{.underline}**
Understandably, cybersecurity cooperation implies a significant amount
of intelligence sharing, which is ultimately impeded by a lack of trust
stemming from political tensions and by the national security concerns
of individual member states. In addition to establishing a more
substantial channel for intelligence sharing to immediately warn allies
about a cyberattack and prevent domino effects, other smaller steps
could help increase cooperation and strengthen resilience in the
trans-Atlantic space. For instance, the establishment of common
standards related to threat and resilience capabilities could, in the
event of a cyberattack, facilitate talks between allies and improve the
interoperability of infrastructure. Within the United Nations, there are
already two working groups trying to advance international legislation
and standards covering the cybersecurity space.69 In line with these
efforts, **[NATO and the EU could adopt similar standards that also help
integrate and reinforce their complementary cybersecurity
strategies]{.underline}**. In particular, **[NATO could look at the
existing EU regulatory framework and adopt similar strategies and
resilience practices across the alliance]{.underline}**, and the EU
could benefit from NATO's vast military experience and capabilities that
are relevant to the cyber domain in order to bolster the security aspect
of the EU's cybersecurity strategy.

### Block -- Solvency -- AI Logistics 

#### The EU needs to establish a clear framework to support AI logistics 

**Franke '20 --** Ulrike, policy fellow at the European Council on
Foreign Relations in London, where she works on emerging technologies in
warfare.,("Europe needs a plan for AI in the military realm", 2/20,
<https://www.the-security-times.com/europe-needs-plan-ai-military-realm/>)
-- sel

[In Europe, 2019 was the year of]{.underline} artificial intelligence
**[(AI).]{.underline}** Governments put together expert groups,
organized public debates and published national strategies designed to
grapple with the possible implications of AI in areas such as health
care, the labor market and transportation. European countries developed
training programs, allocated investment and made plans for research
cooperation. In 2020, the challenge for governments will be to show that
they can fulfill their promises by translating ideas into effective
policies. But [despite attempts to coordinate these efforts]{.underline}
-- most notably that of the European Commission, which called upon
member states to maximize cooperation through the publication of AI
strategies -- [there is one AI-relevant area in which Europe lacks
coherence]{.underline}, and [which]{.underline} generally [receives too
**little** attention]{.underline}. In fact, an analysis of official
documents from various European countries suggests fundamental
differences that may be difficult to bridge. **[This area is the use of
AI in the military realm]{.underline}**. [Despite a marked growth of
work on the economic and societal consequences of the increasing use of
AI in various areas of life, the use of AI in the military is largely
absent from the public discourse in most European
countries.]{.underline} In Germany in particular, officials seem
uncomfortable discussing the subject, unless the focus is on whether and
how to ban "killer robots," or AI-enabled lethal autonomous weapon
systems (LAWS). In other countries -- most notably France, but also the
UK -- there is more expert work on the topic, but this does not
translate into a broader societal debate. Similarly, the academic
discourse on AI in the military focuses on developments in the United
States and China, and tends to overlook Europe. [This neglect is not
helpful]{.underline}. It [means that little information is available
about European thinking on AI in the military, and that there is scant
discussion of how European armed forces plan to use AI]{.underline}. Yet
the fact remains that [European companies are]{.underline} already
**[developing AI-enabled military systems]{.underline}**. [It would be a
bad idea for Europe to try to sit this development out]{.underline} --
or to approach it with an exclusively national focus. While no one can
predict exactly how revolutionary it will be, [AI is likely to have a
**considerable** impact on how militaries operate, and on how wars are
waged.]{.underline} As Europeans discuss plans for strategic sovereignty
-- both in the military and in the technology sector -- **[military
AI]{.underline}**, which is relevant to both areas, **[deserves more
attention.]{.underline}** One of the problems of the European,
particularly German, debate on AI-enabled military systems is the focus
on LAWS. These systems can carry out the critical functions of a
targeting cycle in a military operation, including the selection and
engagement of targets, without human intervention. The potential use of
LAWS comes with a range of legal, ethical and political problems that
are rightly being discussed in the United Nations. But while concern
over LAWS, and work toward regulating them, is to be praised, European
policymakers should not forget that military AI goes beyond killer
robots. AI is, for example, famously good at working with big data to
identify and categorize images and texts. In a military context, [AI can
help sift through]{.underline} massive amounts of [video
footage]{.underline}, such as feeds recorded by drones. Or it can
[examine photographs to single out changes from one picture to the
next]{.underline} -- a useful function to indicate the presence of an
explosive device hidden in the time between the photos were taken.
[Other]{.underline} intelligence-[relevant AI applications include image
and face recognition, translation, image geolocation and
more]{.underline}. [AI can also support **military logistics** through
predictive maintenance based on the analysis of various sensory
inputs.]{.underline} AI-enabled weapons are also likely to be deployed
in cyberspace where it allows actors to both find and patch up cyber
vulnerabilities. Due to cyberspace's relative lack of physical
limitations, and given that fewer organizational changes are required
for it, AI-enabled weapons could be introduced comparatively quickly
into the cyber realm. In many areas, **[AI can make processes faster,
more efficient and cheaper]{.underline}**. Such efficiency gains are
important, especially for cash-strapped militaries. [But technologies
are truly groundbreaking only if they provide new capabilities or allow
for tactics that go beyond what already exists.]{.underline} Artificial
intelligence might be able to provide this in the areas of swarming and
autonomous vehicles -- including, but not limited to, LAWS. Swarming
refers to the combination of many systems -- such as drones, unmanned
boats or tanks -- that can act independently but in a coordinated
manner. Military swarms could provide new capabilities, such as flying
sensor networks, flying minefields or coordinated and automated waves of
attacks that deny the enemy a massed formation to fight. Given these
extensive areas of application and, judging from past efforts to predict
the impact of technologies, there is a good chance the most important
changes to warfare caused by AI are not featured in the list above,
Europe cannot afford to disregard these developments. Of the big three
European states -- Germany, France and the UK -- France has shown the
most interest in military AI. Defense was designated as a priority AI
sector for industrial policy in the French 2018 national AI strategy. In
2019, France became the first European state to publish a military AI
strategy. The country's approach to AI is clearly geopolitical and
driven by concerns over Europe and France becoming tech colonies of the
United States and China. The UK has published neither an overarching
national nor a military AI strategy, but a range of documents, most
notably from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), and
the Defence Ministry's in-house think-tank, DCDC. However, these
publications appear to primarily target the expert community. Among the
big three, Germany is the outlier. In its 2018 national AI strategy, the
military, security and geopolitical elements of AI are notably absent.
Defense is mentioned only in one sentence, which implicitly shifts all
responsibility for this area to the ministry of defense. As this
ministry traditionally publishes few doctrinal or strategy documents, it
is unlikely that a German military AI strategy will see the light of
day. More importantly, the German political realm, spearheaded by the
foreign ministry, seems to have taken the decision to deal with military
AI primarily from an arms control angle. As a consequence, the German
expert community focuses mostly on AI arms control and disarmament.
Given the extent to which this angle dominates the debate, and how
different it is from the French approach, it poses questions for joint
French-German projects like the new Future Combat Air System fighter
jet, which will rely heavily on AI elements. [Given the changes expected
to be caused by AI in the military realm and given the level of
attention paid to the issue in other countries -- most notably the US,
China and Russia -- as well as European yearnings for strategic
sovereignty, Europeans should pay closer attention to military AI. It is
counterproductive to let valid concerns about LAWS marginalize the
debate on all military AI.]{.underline}

**[While there are notable technical, bureaucratic, and political

standards for data sharing, investing in collaborative R&D programs,
advancing multinational public-private partnerships, and integrating

interests, promote interoperability, and ultimately, pave the path

### Block -- Solvency -- Ethical AI 

#### EU guidelines on AI regulation maximize ethical guidance and competition 

**Smuha '19 --** Natalie A., Legal scholar and philosopher at the KU
Leuven Faculty of Law, where she examines legal, ethical and
philosophical questions around Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other
digital technologies., ("The EU Approach to Ethics Guidelines for
Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence", Computer Law Review International
Vol. 20; iss. 4; pp. 97 -- 106.) -- sel

1\. **[The Revival of AI Ethics]{.underline}** It is becoming ever more
clear that, contrary to the hope some may hold, **[AI
systems]{.underline}** are not a miracle solution to all our problems.
Rather, much like any type of technology, they [represent a double-edged
sword that can be used both in a beneficial and in a harming
way]{.underline}. To offer but a few examples; AI systems can be used to
help us achieving more objective decisionmaking, yet they can also
perpetuate and even exacerbate unfair biases. AI systems can be used to
offer us more personalised and qualitative services, yet they can also
hamper our decisional autonomy. And while AI systems can be used to
enhance our security, they can also be deployed as a means of
illegitimate surveillance and stifle our freedom. The [multifaceted
impact that AI systems]{.underline} (along with other modern ICTs) have
on our lives -- which is not only ethical, but also legal, social,
economical, political, cultural and psychological in nature --
[enables]{.underline} those [systems to shift more than one paradigm in
our society.]{.underline} The [transformative force they exert on the
world]{.underline} may not be as brisk and theatrical as some movies
portray, but is rather [expected to generate change]{.underline}s in
more slow and subtle ways, [which]{.underline} nevertheless [have the
potential to alter our habits, processes and lives
profoundly.]{.underline} Governments and policy-makers around the world
are starting to wake up to these important concerns. [Besides adopting
national strategies to boost the development and uptake of AI systems to
reap their benefits, they are also assessing the technology's
potentially harmful impact and exploring which policy measures are best
suited to address it.]{.underline} This occurs not only at national, but
also at European level. Indeed, given that the concerns raised by AI do
not stop at national borders, coordinated action is needed to tackle
them. 2. Europe's Response In April 2018, following an invitation by the
European Council to put forward a European approach to AI5 , [the
European Commission presented its strategy for AI in the Commission
Communication "Artificial Intelligence for Europe]{.underline}".6 The
[strategy evolves around three pillars, aiming to tackle AI's challenges
and opportunities through a holistic approach]{.underline}: (1)
**[boosting investments]{.underline}** in AI, (2) **[preparing for
socio-economic changes]{.underline}** and (3) **[ensuring]{.underline}**
an **[adequate ethical and legal framework]{.underline}**. At the same
time, the st[rategy emphasised the need for coordination with Member
States]{.underline}, so as [to]{.underline} leverage joint efforts and
[maximise the impact of individual states' action.]{.underline} This
resulted in the adoption of a second Communication in December 2018,
containing a Coordinated Plan on AI that sets out around 70 actions that
Member States and the Commission have committed to undertake in order to
implement the European strategy. 7 [To ensure **continuity** of
action]{.underline}, [the Plan will be updated on an annual
basis]{.underline}. Both of [the Commission]{.underline}'s
Communications [stressed the need to assess the adequacy of existing
legal rules to protect individuals from potential **adverse effects** of
AI systems, and to establish **ethical guidance** to ensure that the
development, deployment and use of AI systems do not occur at the
expense of fundamental rights and European values.]{.underline} It is
against this background that in June 2018 the High-Level Expert Group on
Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG) was established. Bearing in mind the
holistic approach of the European strategy, the AI HLEG was tasked with
the preparation of two deliverables: (1) AI Ethics Guidelines and (2) AI
Policy and Investment Recommendations.8 The documents are meant to
complement each other. While the Guidelines provide guidance to AI
practitioners9 on how they can bring their AI systems in line with
ethical principles (on top of any legal obligations they already have),
[the Recommendations are addressed to European institutions and Member
States, offering them advice on which policy measures to adopt in order
to ensure Europe's **competitiveness** in AI as well as an adequate
regulatory framework, beyond **ethical guidance**.]{.underline} On 8
April 2019, the AI HLEG published its Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy
AI. On the same day, the Commission adopted its third Communication on
AI within a year, in which it welcomed the work of the AI HLEG and
expressed its support for the ethical framework it put forward. 10 This
paper focuses on the creation of the AI HLEG "Ethics Guidelines for
Trustworthy AI", starting with a contextualisation of their aim and
purpose (II). Next, some insights on their drafting process are
provided, which spanned not only expert group deliberations, but also
over 500 comments received through an open consultation (III).
Particular attention is devoted to the questions on the respective role
played by ethics and law (IV.), and to the challenges that had to be
overcome throughout the drafting process (V). Subsequently, the
Guidelines' next steps are set out (VI), and their relevance against a
background of international AI policy-making is examined (VII). Finally,
some concluding remarks are offered (VIII).

Yet U.S. policy has consistently opposed EU defense efforts since the
late 1990s, arguing that EU defense efforts would undermine NATO. State
Department officials' **[oft-repeated claim]{.underline}**, virtually
unchanged over the past three decades, **[is that an EU defense
structure would "duplicate" NATO, making the treaty organization
obsolete]{.underline}**. Democratic and Republican administrations have
repeated the mantra "no duplication" so often that it has become U.S.
policy doctrine.5 But **[rarely, if ever,]{.underline}** **[is the
concern about possible duplication actually unpacked and
assessed]{.underline}**.

This report **[reject]{.underline}**s **[the notion that NATO and EU
defense are incompatible and at odds]{.underline}**. **[Supporting EU
defense does not mean choosing the EU over NATO. This is a false choice
and a faulty premise. The EU and NATO are not opposing organizations.
They are]{.underline}**, in fact, **[fundamentally
tethered]{.underline}**. Implicit in U.S. opposition is a fear of a
powerful EU that could supplant NATO and become a thorn in America's
side. But **[the EU is not divorced from the 21 NATO member states that
make up the EU. If the EU and United States became rivals, then NATO
would itself be obsolete, as it would be divided against itself. Such
fanciful scenarios would not be the result of the EU developing a
defense capacity but the result of a massive diplomatic breakdown. Such
a breakdown is highly unlikely]{.underline}**, and U.S. foreign policy
should be doing everything possible to avoid this scenario.

As this report argues, the **[EU could]{.underline}** **[significantly
strengthen]{.underline}** **[NATO and the trans-Atlantic
alliance]{.underline}**. **[Integrating European forces, acquiring key
capabilities, rationalizing and harmonizing the sprawling EU defense
sector, and investing in cutting-edge research are some of the areas
where the EU could play a critical role]{.underline}**. **[As the EU
develops its own defense capabilities, there would inevitably be some
institutional overlap and duplication with NATO, just as there is with
any other national military]{.underline}**. **[But even if the EU's
defense efforts were to create some overlap]{.underline}** and
institutional friction, **[this would be a rather]{.underline}**
**[small bureaucratic concern]{.underline}**---**[one that could easily
be addressed by better EU-NATO coordination]{.underline}**. Yet the
bureaucratic worry over duplication has been elevated to such an extent
that it has become untethered from its actual significance, which is
quite minor. **[Instead of fretting over bureaucratic trivia, the United

Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) could be potential
participants, but what about the European Union and its member states?
While the European Union will never be the main actor in resolving the
North Korean crisis, there is an argument for Europe's increased
participation in the debate.

The European Union's Potential Added-value on North Korea

**[The [E]{.mark}]{.underline}**uropean
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion's **[[multiple-layered]{.mark}
diplomatic [approach represents a unique tool for]{.mark} placing
[pressure]{.mark} on troublesome countries: besides members states'
bilateral channels, the E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion
**[[is]{.mark} also [a vehicle]{.mark} aimed at [undertaking]{.mark}
coordinated [action once]{.mark} political [consensus]{.mark} has
[emerged]{.mark}. Twenty-six]{.underline}** out of twenty-eight EU
**[members maintain diplomatic relations with the]{.underline}**
Democratic People's Republic of Korea **[(DPRK)]{.underline}**, six of
which have diplomatic offices in Pyongyang (France only has a
humanitarian and cultural office). **[These [bilateral ties]{.mark} are
diverse]{.underline}**, with some dating back to the Cold War. **[They
[are]{.mark} of [crucial]{.mark} importance [to]{.mark} the North
[Korea]{.mark}n regime]{.underline}**, as part of its narrative on
legitimacy and its appetite for international recognition, which may be
attractive to them. **[Washington would certainly benefit from having
the E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion and its members
**[more proactively using their own diplomatic influence on the regime
and its clients]{.underline}**.

Furthermore, **[[EU expertise]{.mark} in proliferation crises
[is]{.mark} often [underrated]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The European Union
was a party to the negotiations with Iran, as was France, the United
Kingdom, and Germany. Most member states actively take part in the
Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), intercepting illicit trade
flows across the Mediterranean. Moreover, the European Union has
implemented one of the most comprehensive restrictive measures regimes
against North Korea, which has evolved into a comprehensive strategy
directly targeting the civil and military proliferation chain, as well
as strategic economic sectors. Finally, the 2016 decision to put an end
to hosting the DPRK's overseas workers also represents a laudable
attempt to tackle financial flows that indirectly support proliferation
activities, which sets a precedent for the activities of Russia, China,
and several of North Korea's clients in Africa and the Middle East.
However, outreach among the United States, South Korea, Japan, and the
European Union on these practices has been limited so far, preventing
full harmonization of national policies among the like-minded.

**[[As an external actor]{.mark} to the region, the
[E]{.mark}]{.underline}**uropean **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion
**[[could]{.mark} play a particular role in [unlock]{.mark}ing
[negotiations]{.mark}. First, it has a better record on implementing
restrictive measures than]{.underline}**, for example, some potential
**[new Asian players]{.underline}**, whose stance is more ambiguous.
**[Second, [it]{.mark} is a bureaucratic machine that [has]{.mark} the
[unique capacity to build consensus]{.mark} among partners [even
when]{.mark} their [interests are at odds]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Paradoxically, **[the ability to observe]{.underline}** North Korea
**[from afar might give the E]{.underline}**uropean
**[U]{.underline}**nion **[an advantage]{.underline}** over the
participants of the Six-Party Talks where the six countries have
different vital interests at stake. In this regard, the European Union
is detached just enough to dare to make innovative proposals.

#### Nuclear war

Timothy **Graves 17**, Master's Degree in Creative Writing from
Birkbeck, University of London, "Is The World On The Brink Of Nuclear
Armageddon?", Huffington Post,
http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/timothy-graves/nuclear-armageddon_b_14789678.html

Since Donald Trump's presidential inauguration last month, sales of
dystopian fiction have soared. Novels that have flown off the shelf, or
recently made it into Amazon's top ten best-selling books chart, include
George Orwell's 1984, Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale and Huxley's
Brave New World. The resurgent interest in fiction that depicts a bleak
totalitarian and authoritarian society reflects the fact that we are now
living in a much more volatile and dangerous world. I do not think it is
scaremongering to say that **[in recent years [humanity]{.mark} has
[faced]{.mark} a number of]{.underline}** catastrophic or even
**[[existential threats]{.underline}]{.mark}**. From climate change and
the rise in international terrorism to the prevalence of biological and
chemical weapons, our capacity for warfare and destruction, and what the
poet Robert Burns called 'man's inhumanity to man', is self-evident.

But I believe **[the [most pressing and immediate]{.mark} threat
[is]{.mark} that posed by the [arsenals of nuclear weapons]{.mark} that
have been [stockpiled]{.mark} by the nuclear-armed states of the world
[who take false refuge in]{.mark}]{.underline}** the Mutually Assured
Destruction doctrine **[([MAD]{.mark})]{.underline}**. In light of
President Trump's comments about nuclear weapons, last month atomic
scientists in Chicago moved the hands on the Doomsday Clock to the
closest it has been to midnight for sixty four years. Midnight
represents global nuclear war.

With the ushering in of what some are already calling The New World
Order, **[there are]{.underline}** currently several
**[[flashpoints]{.mark} across the globe which [could trigger a nuclear
war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. With a realignment in U.S.-Russian relations
and Trump's commitment to NATO in question, if Putin were to invade one
or more of the Baltic States the situation could easily escalate and
potentially trigger a nuclear strike. Russia itself is preparing for
nuclear conflict. In October last year, the Russian government launched
a nationwide nuclear training exercise with forty million people. It
also unveiled Russia's latest 'super-nuke', aptly dubbed 'Satan 2',
which has the power to wipe out most of Britain, Northern France, the
Netherlands and Belgium in a single strike. This month Vladimir Putin
ordered the Russian air force to prepare for a 'time of war'.

Other potential **[[geo-political flashpoints include North
Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the Pakistan/Indian dispute over
Kashmir. **[A few days ago, in violation of U]{.underline}**nited
**[N]{.underline}**ations **[resolutions, North [Korea]{.mark}
successfully [test-fired a new]{.mark} type of medium to long-range
[ballistic missile]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Kim-Jong-**[Un]{.underline}**, supreme leader of the Democratic People's
Republic of North Korea, has warned the West that he **[will soon have
nuclear weapons [capable of targeting the U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Whether this is true or not, **[it seems highly likely that North
[Korea]{.mark} already [has]{.mark} the [capacity to put a nuclear
warhead on a]{.mark} medium range [missile]{.mark} which would be [in
easy striking distance]{.mark} of South Korea or Japan. [This]{.mark},
in turn, [increases]{.mark} the risk of [nuclear prolif]{.mark}eration
in the region]{.underline}**.

### Block -- A/O -- Democracy

#### Democracy is collapsing now -- EU tech leadership solves. 

**Ringhof and Torreblanca 22** \[Julian Ringhof, José Ignacio
Torreblanca, 5-17-2022, \"The geopolitics of technology: How the EU can
become a global player\", ECFR,
https://ecfr.eu/publication/the-geopolitics-of-technology-how-the-eu-can-become-a-global-player/,
DOA: 6-20-2022 //ArchanSen\]

The future of the EU also depends on its capacity to sustain democracy
and democratic institutions, both at home and abroad. However, for 15
consecutive years, democracy has been in decline around the world, both
in the number and in the quality of democracies. Coincident with this
decline, both born-again and long-standing authoritarian regimes are
growing stronger and more challenging. Misuse of digital technologies
has contributed to these trends. This not only serves to undermine
democracies by fuelling political polarisation and providing the tools
for foreign influence operations, but it also helps authoritarian
governments cement their grip on their citizens. Countering these trends
is not only a moral necessity for the EU but also essential to securing
its global interests.

The vision behind EU digital policy should thus be to secure and promote
both its economic power base and its political model, at home and
globally. To achieve this vision, the EU needs to act strategically.
Acting strategically means that in designing its means and ends, the
union needs to understand what other countries and powers are doing and
how it plans to compete and cooperate with them. China and Russia have
started a process of decoupling from the West, to which they seek to
attract other countries. The rules-based order is being replaced by a
power-based order. Geoeconomics (or sheer mercantilism) is back. States
are using economic and technological interdependencies to impose their
views and secure their geopolitical interests. It is a new world order
-- and in that world, technology becomes a key element of power,
sovereignty, and survival.

To secure its interests, values, and global standing, the EU should
embed its open-market and human-centric approach to technology in its
alliances, partnerships, and the multilateral organisations to which it
belongs. In a world where technology is disputed and weaponised, the
more technologically sovereign like-minded countries are, the more the
EU's own sovereignty and its global geo-technology standing are assured;
the more allies are protected against foreign influence operations,
cyberattacks, and coercion derived from technological vulnerabilities,
the more alignment and cooperation with the EU at the global level will
be facilitated. The EU should therefore aim not at technological
independence but at mutually reinforced and shared technological
sovereignty with its allies.

### Block -- A/O -- China Tech

#### **EU tech autonomy is key to check back against Chinese tech supremacy.**

**Larsen 20** (Henrik B. L. Larsen, PhD and a Senior Researcher at the
Center for Security Studies (CSS) at the Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology, "Europe's Awakening to China's Tech Dominance," Harvard
International Review, October 2020,
https://hir.harvard.edu/europe-awakening-china-tech-dominance/)//JRD

[The **EU** must be a **tech** **superpower** in its own right with a
far larger number of large companies [than it has
today](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2019/05/15/worlds-largest-tech-companies-2019/#58ac0dac734f).]{.underline}
The tech industry operates in an oligopolized world market with a
handful of suppliers. Europe in most technologies faces a choice between
either China or the United States. An exception is 5G where Europe has
its own technological superstars, Nokia and Ericsson (the United States,
by contrast, has no significant 5G market competitor). The increasing
number of country decisions to discard Huawei already gives the two
companies a strong foundation on the European home markets.

The EU must come to the realization that [the **only** **way** to make
**European** **tech** companies able to **compete** **globally** is to
allow them to grow into **global** **champions** that can innovate at
scale. **China**]{.underline}**'s** mercantilist methods and proactive
promotion of its national tech champions [**compel** a **revision** of
the EU's original focus to create the best possible conditions for
competition on the internal market]{.underline}. It was arguably a
strategic mistake when the European Commission [blocked a 2019
merger](https://www.ft.com/content/6e344f6a-29fd-11e9-88a4-c32129756dd8) between
a German and a French rail manufacturing company (Siemens/Alstom), a
manifestation for the EU's laggardness in prioritizing global
competitiveness. The [European Commission\'s decision is]{.underline}
especially [disconcerting when taking into account the risk of
**global** **dominance** of **Chinese** state-owned or state-subsidized
**enterprises**]{.underline} as well as China's restriction of foreign
access to its own domestic market. China-like subsidies can hardly come
into question. However, Europe's consolidated aerospace industry with
Airbus stands out as a successful example of the use of infrastructure
support, beneficial loans, and the advancement of research and
development to gain global competitiveness.

Similar support measures today could boost European tech and
manufacturing hubs, beginning with the existing telecom giants that need
to remain competitive [beyond 5G/toward
6G](https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/leak-eu-charts-6g-future-in-ambitious-industrial-plan/).

has [elevated the
debate](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/the-european-union-and-the-search-for-digital-sovereignty/) about
Europe's digital sovereignty to the level of shortcomings of its own
industrial-technological base that hinder its ability to innovate and
compete at the global level. Building on this awareness, export control
should become more strategic to prevent a proliferation of [dual-use
technologies](https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/op80.pdf) where
the EU still has an edge over China.

Battle over Global Standards

[The **geopolitical** **implications** of China's
forwardness]{.underline} on 5G caught the Western community by surprise,
even though China openly declared its ambition to pursue [high-tech
leadership](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/made-china-2025-threat-global-trade) five
years ago. Chinese innovation is fast---in addition to the allocation
of [\$1.4
trillion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-20/china-has-a-new-1-4-trillion-plan-to-overtake-the-u-s-in-tech) to
its high-tech sectors over the next five years, Beijing later is set to
release its new plan 'China Standards 2035' to influence [the next
generation of
technologies](https://www.cfr.org/blog/china-standards-2035-and-plan-world-domination-dont-believe-chinas-hype):
the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, and 5G. [The
**EU**]{.underline}, the European countries, and their tech communities
[need to be **forward-looking** and understand that the **competition**
with **China** is also a **competition** **over global
standards**.]{.underline} Whereas China developed its own 3G and 4G
standards to protect its domestic market from external competition, it
clearly [turned this ambition
outward](https://itif.org/publications/2020/04/27/us-national-strategy-5g-and-future-wireless-innovation) with
5G for its own mercantilist advantage. [The **importance** of **global**
**standards** cannot be stressed enough: the standards for the Internet
we use today were **set** **by** the leading **US**]{.underline}
[companies]{.underline} like IBM, Intel and Microsoft in the 1990s.

Recognizing the importance of standard-setting, the Chinese government
and Chinese companies have [stepped up their
efforts](https://www.uscc.gov/annual-report/2018-annual-report-congress) in
contributing to and leading the global standards-setting bodies, notably
the UN's International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and the
industry-led 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), a key player in
5G. On the one hand it is positive that China, which has [the largest
share](https://www.13d.com/landing-pages/fiveg/#nutshell) of the 5G
"standard-essential" patents, is engaged in the global bodies to set
common standards. On the other hand, [China could
potentially [**politicize** the **global** **standardization**
processes](https://www.csis.org/analysis/can-telephones-race-5g-and-evolution-telecom) to
give its **own** **companies** **first**-**mover** and perhaps a
**permanent** **advantage**.]{.underline} The Chinese companies are
under [strong
pressure](https://itif.org/publications/2020/04/27/us-national-strategy-5g-and-future-wireless-innovation) and [state
coordination](https://www.ui.se/globalassets/ui.se-eng/publications/other-publications/technical-standardisation-china-and-the-future-international-order.pdf#page%2023) by
the Chinese Communist Party to vote against technologically superior
standards when they disadvantage the Chinese industry[. Shedding light
on and pushing back against China's practices requires global
leadership.]{.underline} [**The** **EU**, its member states, and tech
companies need to [**step** **up** their **efforts** and internal
**coordination**](https://www.ui.se/globalassets/ui.se-eng/publications/other-publications/technical-standardisation-china-and-the-future-international-order.pdf#page%2029) in
the **standardization** **bodies** to maintain]{.underline} their still
[strong positions and **ensure** that the **processes** are
**politically** **neutral** and that technologies remain
**interoperable**.]{.underline}

[The **alternative** to **global** **standards**]{.underline} [may be
competing standards that could **divide** the **digital**
**economy**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}, in the long run, underpin a
beginning bifurcation between an old Western-led and a new China-led
order. Not to forget, China [in
parallel](https://www.ifri.org/en/publications/notes-de-lifri/china-and-new-geopolitics-technical-standardization) to
its activism in the global bodies facilitates the deployment of its own
standards bilaterally through the "Belt and Road" and other
initiatives. It is hardly surprising that the consolidated autocracies
around the world follow China's technological leadership. However, it is
worrying that the [developing nations in **Asia, the Middle East**, and
**Africa**]{.underline} tend to tag along, as they [[**depend** on
**Chinese** **investments** and
loans](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/kiel-working-papers/chinas-overseas-lending-12820/) ]{.underline}and
because China's [Digital Silk

their growing appetite for inexpensive connectivity.

externalization of its regulations and norms through market
mechanisms---works well within liberal democracies that cherish privacy
protection and human rights as well as with the big tech companies that
operate within them. However, the "Brussels effect" may not provide a
crucial pull or competitive edge in the rest of the world's digital
economies. [**China's** **cooperation**]{.underline} with Greece,

#### Chinese tech leadership leads to nuclear war

**Kroenig, professor of government, writes in 2018**, Deputy Director
for Strategy, Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security Associate
Professor of Government and Foreign Service, Georgetown University
(Matthew, Nov 12, 2018, "Will disruptive technology cause nuclear war?"
*BAS*,
<https://thebulletin.org/2018/11/will-disruptive-technology-cause-nuclear-war>)

Recently, analysts have argued that emerging technologies with military
applications may undermine nuclear stability (see here, here, and here),
but the logic of these arguments is debatable and overlooks a more
straightforward reason why **[new technology might cause nuclear
conflict: by upending the existing balance of power among nuclear-armed
states.]{.underline}** This latter concern is more probable and
dangerous and demands an immediate policy response. For more than 70
years, the world has avoided major power conflict, and many attribute
this era of peace to nuclear weapons. In situations of mutually assured
destruction (MAD), neither side has an incentive to start a conflict
because doing so will only result in its own annihilation. The key to
this model of deterrence is the maintenance of secure second-strike
capabilities---the ability to absorb an enemy nuclear attack and respond
with a devastating counterattack. Recently analysts have begun to worry,
however, that new strategic military technologies may make it possible
for a state to conduct a successful first strike on an enemy. For
example, Chinese colleagues have complained to me in Track II dialogues
that the United States may decide to launch a sophisticated cyberattack
against Chinese nuclear command and control, essentially turning off
China's nuclear forces. Then, Washington will follow up with a massive
strike with conventional cruise and hypersonic missiles to destroy
China's nuclear weapons. Finally, if any Chinese forces happen to
survive, the United States can simply mop up China's ragged retaliatory
strike with advanced missile defenses. China will be disarmed and US
nuclear weapons will still be sitting on the shelf, untouched. If the
United States, or any other state acquires such a first-strike
capability, then the logic of MAD would be undermined. Washington may be
tempted to launch a nuclear first strike. Or China may choose instead to
use its nuclear weapons early in a conflict before they can be wiped
out---the so-called "use 'em or lose 'em" problem. According to this
logic, therefore, the appropriate policy response would be to ban
outright or control any new weapon systems that might threaten
second-strike capabilities. This way of thinking about new technology
and stability, however, is open to question. Would any US president
truly decide to launch a massive, bolt-out-of-the-blue nuclear attack
because he or she thought s/he could get away with it? And why does it
make sense for the country in the inferior position, in this case China,
to intentionally start a nuclear war that it will almost certainly lose?
More important, this conceptualization of how new technology affects
stability is too narrow, focused exclusively on how new military
technologies might be used against nuclear forces directly. Rather, we
should think more broadly about how new technology might affect global
politics, and, for this, it is helpful to turn to scholarly
international relations theory. **[The dominant theory of the causes of
war in the academy is [the]{.mark} "[bargaining model of war.]{.mark}"
This theory [identifies rapid shifts in the balance of power as a
primary cause of conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline}** International politics
often presents states with conflicts that they can settle through
peaceful bargaining, but when bargaining breaks down, war results.
[**Shifts in the** balance of power **are problematic because they
undermine effective bargaining.**]{.underline} After all, why agree to a
deal today if your bargaining position will be stronger tomorrow? And, a
clear understanding of the military balance of power can contribute to
peace. (Why start a war you are likely to lose?) But shifts in the
balance of power muddy understandings of which states have the
advantage. You may see where this is going. **[New technologies threaten
to create potentially destabilizing shifts in the balance of power. For
decades, stability in Europe and Asia has been supported by US military
power]{.underline}**. In recent years, however, **[the balance of power
in Asia has begun to shift]{.underline}**, as **[China has increased its
military capabilities]{.underline}**. Already, **[Beijing has become
more assertive in the region]{.underline}**, **[claiming contested
territory in the South China Sea]{.underline}**. And the results of
Russia's military modernization have been on full display in its ongoing
intervention in Ukraine. Moreover, **[[China may have]{.mark} the
[lead]{.mark} over the United States [in emerging tech]{.mark}nologies
[that could be decisive for]{.mark} the [future of military]{.mark}
acquisitions [and warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[including 3D
printing, hypersonic missiles, quantum computing, 5G wireless
connectivity, and artificial intelligence (AI).]{.underline}** And
Russian President Vladimir Putin is building new unmanned vehicles while
ominously declaring, "Whoever leads in AI will rule the world." If China
or Russia are able to incorporate new technologies into their militaries
before the United States, then this could lead to the kind of rapid
shift in the balance of power that often causes war. **[[If Beijing
believes emerging technologies]{.mark} [provide]{.mark} it with
[a]{.mark} newfound, local [military advantage]{.mark} over the United
States, for example, [it may be more willing]{.mark} than previously [to
initiate conflict over Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And if Putin
thinks new tech has strengthened his hand, he may be more tempted to
launch a Ukraine-style invasion of a NATO member. **[Either scenario
could bring these nuclear powers into direct conflict with the United
States, and once nuclear armed states are at war, [there is an inherent
risk of nuclear conflict through]{.mark} limited nuclear war strategies,
[nuclear brinkmanship, or]{.mark} simple accident or [inadvertent
escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This framing of the problem leads to
a different set of policy implications. The concern is not simply
technologies that threaten to undermine nuclear second-strike
capabilities directly, but, rather, any technologies that can result in
a meaningful shift in the broader balance of power. And the solution is
not to preserve second-strike capabilities, but to preserve prevailing
power balances more broadly. When it comes to new technology, this means
that the United States should seek to maintain an innovation edge.
Washington should also work with other states, including its
nuclear-armed rivals, to develop a new set of arms control and
nonproliferation agreements and export controls to deny these newer and
potentially destabilizing technologies to potentially hostile states.
**[These are no easy tasks, but the consequences of Washington losing
the race for technological superiority to its autocratic challengers
just might mean nuclear Armageddon]{.underline}**.

### Block -- A/O -- LL

#### Multiple scenarios for extinction

**Markley 16** (Stephen, Journalist for Paste Magazine, "Is France the
Final Domino for the European Union?", Paste Magazine, December 15,
2016,
https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/12/is-france-the-final-domino-for-the-european-union.html)

For many Americans reading this, there is no doubt a sense of remove
from the relevance of the European project. Think of it this way:
**[[for centuries Europe]{.mark} was the Middle East of the world. It
was a [war-hungry]{.mark}, dysfunctional, violent, chaotic piece of the
globe that could barely go a decade without a barbaric, usually
pointless blood-letting conflict. Since World War II]{.underline}** and
the **[[economic]{.mark} and political
[integration]{.mark}]{.underline}** that
**[[brought]{.underline}]{.mark}** former nation-state rivals into
mutually beneficial **[coexistence]{.underline}**, the continent has
been a region of **[[remarkable]{.mark} prosperity and
[stability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Keep in mind, this has never happened
before in human history: a set of political leaders and their
constituents voluntarily chose to cede elements of sovereignty in order
to form a better, stronger union. The United States and Great Britain,
often mentioned as democratic ideals, were two empires won by violent
conquest in which wealthy elites only begrudgingly allowed democracy to
sift down to the most impoverished and brutalized citizens.

The parochial movements of the last five to ten years---from the EU's
troubles to the Scottish independence vote to the surge of American
nationalism that brought us such phenomenon as the go-it-alone war in
Iraq and now Donald Trump---have different roots and causes but they do
share a common thread. **[[We live in an]{.mark} increasingly complex
and [interdependent world where]{.mark} the [great]{.mark}est
[threats]{.mark} to peace, individual well-being, and human flourishing
[are]{.mark} largely [transnational. Climate]{.mark} change, infectious
[disease]{.mark}, nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration, [financial crisis,
cyber insecurity]{.mark}]{.underline}**---these **[[are]{.mark} all
[borderless]{.mark} phenomenon]{.underline}** that do not care if their
victims are French, British, American, or Syrian. Their worst
consequences do not care about our flags, languages, religions, or skin
colors. And **[yet at a time when [transnational peril
necessitates]{.mark} a greater need for [cooperation]{.mark}, tolerance,
and unity, Western liberal democracies are taking a hard turn into
fragmentation, arrogance, self-pity, and denial. The [break-up of the
E]{.mark}]{.underline}**uropean **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion brought
on by a wave of selfish, quasi-authoritarian nationalism **[[would be a

In this article **[the transatlantic relationship is defined as the
overall set of relations between the US and the EU]{.underline}**,
relations that are maintained via engagements in institutions such as
NATO (Smith 2018, 539). **[This relationship has been intimately linked
to the ebbs and flows of two interconnected structural
changes]{.underline}**. First, **[since the end of the Cold War era,
systemic changes in the international arena have seen successive US
administrations and European leaders alternate between fully embracing
shared views and interests]{.underline}**, with limited disagreement on
certain issues, and episodes of acute discord and crisis. **[To name a
few points of disagreement, the US-led invasion of Iraq; nuclear
strategy; and international development, monetary and trade policies
have caused many furrowed brows]{.underline}** in both European capitals
and Washington. **[These]{.underline}** issues **[all arose long before
the US strategic pivot towards Asia, disagreements over China, the
lingering effects of]{.underline}** former President Donald J.
**[Trump]{.underline}**'s transactional approach to foreign policy,
**[data privacy and]{.underline}** the recent responses to the novel
**[coronavirus]{.underline}** pandemic.

**[Second, structural changes in the EU integration project and the
increasing supranationalisation of the EU's defence]{.underline}**
policy have also had powerful repercussions. **[The growing role of the
European Commission in defence technological and industrial
matters]{.underline}** and the launch of the European Defence Fund, an
unprecedented funding scheme financed directly from the EU budget to
support homegrown European collaborative defence research and
development (Håkansson 2021), have raised concerns across the Atlantic.
In recent years, a new momentum in EU defence integration has taken
shape around the concept of European strategic autonomy, coupled with
pragmatic policy steps and initiatives prioritising European sovereignty
in defence industrial areas, as well as technological and digital
matters (Csernatoni 2021b). **[This growing supranationalisation has
been partly triggered by the combination of former President Trump's
vitriolic stance towards the EU and NATO, the EU losing its strongest
transatlantic link with the UK's departure, and the evolving
international technological rivalry between the US and
China]{.underline}**. Such challenges have called for a critical
reappraisal of European autonomy and dependency in key technological
areas, from defence, emerging and disruptive technologies (EDTs), and
the digital domain, to space. Conversely, EU talk and action to spend
more on military and technological power have provoked fears that
European defence and technological cooperation will lead to industrial
rivalry with the US or a duplication of NATO's efforts.

Against this backdrop, instead of broadly examining how the structural
cracks in the transatlantic bond have emerged and are growing, **[this
article zooms in on the challenges to the relationship posed by
technological innovation, both as a driver of cooperation and as a cause
for further rivalry]{.underline}**. In doing so, the article explores
three core and interrelated dimensions:

- **[the transatlantic technology gap]{.underline}** and the EU's quest
  for technological sovereignty---namely the desire to strengthen
  Europe's technological competitive edge, support a strong industrial
  base and reduce dependencies in critical technology areas and value
  chains;

- **[differing approaches to technological innovation]{.underline}** and
  the role of emerging and disruptive technologies; and

- **[the values-based governance]{.underline}** and regulation **[of
  digital and technology issues.]{.underline}**

In the shifting geopolitical context, **[the EU and the US share values
and have a common interest in navigating the current and emerging
technology challenges together by leveraging their common strengths and
operationalising a transatlantic technology agenda]{.underline}**. As
fast-paced technological and digital transformations continue to disrupt
societies, economies and geopolitics, technology must be at the heart of
a revived phase in EU--US cooperation and trust. Granted, this will be
easier said than done

### Block -- UQ -- EU Tech k Power

#### Russia, China, and the US are all outcompeting the EU. Revitalized strategy is key.

become a global player\", ECFR,

DOA: 6-20-2022 //ArchanSen\]

**[Today's major powers engage in comprehensive global
tech]{.underline}**nology **[politics]{.underline}**. The weaponisation,
mastering, and control of digital technologies is the new 'Great Game'.
**[These power dynamics]{.underline}** are helping **[shape
technological spheres of influence]{.underline}**. Countries in Latin
America and the Caribbean, Africa, and the Indo-Pacific -- but also in
central Eastern Europe and the Balkans -- have fallen or may soon fall
under Chinese or Russian technological influence or dominance. China is
luring countries into technological dependencies to undermine their
political sovereignty through its Digital Silk Road (DSR) initiative.
Beijing also shields its own citizens from foreign influence with its
'great firewall' and develops industrial strategies to secure its
technological autonomy from the West. It uses digital disinformation to
influence public opinion in other countries, mounts cyberattacks and
cyberespionage to strengthen its industrial base, strategically deploys
attractively-priced 5G technologies abroad to gain control of telecom
networks, and tries to impose its technical standards through
international organisations.

Together with Russia, China is attempting to ingrain authoritarian
values into the global cyberspace. Russia is also leveraging and
restricting mass media and social networks to protect its interests,
shielding its population from democratic temptations, and waging an
information war against the West and its allies with the aim of
undermining citizens' faith in democracy.

Meanwhile, **[the United States tries to offset Chinese and Russian
influence]{.underline}**, **[seeks to maintain its cutting-edge
advantage on military]{.underline}** artificial intelligence (**[AI) and
other tech]{.underline}**nologies, and backs and protects the interests
of its major technology companies globally. It also denies other nations
access to key technologies, monitors critical investments in the
technology sector to avoid security risks, seeks to secure and control
critical supply chains (especially of semiconductors), and imposes
export controls and even embargoes on sensitive technologies.

As for the European Union, the Brussels institutions are trying to shape
global standards of privacy and data protection, digital platforms, and
AI according to European values  using the attractiveness and power of
its internal market. The EU also promotes digital partnerships with
like-minded countries and allies -- and announced, in December 2021, the
"Global Gateway" initiative as the EU version of China's DSR.

All this implies that the **[EU has begun to play the global technology
game. But it is nowhere near its rivals in terms of sophistication,
strategy, resources, and vision]{.underline}**. **[If the EU is to learn
to speak the language of power, it needs to understand its efforts as
part of an integrated digital strategy that can both cooperate and
compete with those of China, Russia, and even the US.]{.underline}**

**[The historical development of closer [Eu]{.mark}ropean
[security]{.mark}]{.underline}** and defense industrial **[and
[tech]{.mark}nological [coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}**
**[[is]{.mark} a [complex]{.mark} affair]{.underline}**.8
**[[It]{.underline}]{.mark}** has **[[involved]{.mark} highly networked
and [transnational EU-state]{.mark}-industrial [relations across
various]{.mark} EU [institutions]{.mark} and [agencies, interest groups,
and]{.mark} security and defense indus[trial actors. It]{.mark} also
[illustrates member states']{.mark} increasing [willingness to give the
EU a more significant part to play]{.mark} in security and defense
matters]{.underline}**. Given the salience of current debates concerning
the EU's defense and technological sovereignty, the costs and benefits
of European security and defense research and innovation programs need
to be set out in full.9 Moreover, the contributions of various interest
groups and EU institutions also need to be further examined. Linked to
this discussion is a broader understanding among member states that the
EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) needs a new level of
strategic ambition, with an awareness of the benefits of establishing a
European defense industrial and technological research and innovation
policy.

### Block -- INB -- Tech Key

#### EU tech leadership is necessary for broader clout. 

**Csernatoni 21** \[Raluca Csernatoni, 8-12-2021, \"The EU's Rise as a
Defense Technological Power: From Strategic Autonomy to Technological
Sovereignty\", Carnegie Europe,

DOA: 6-20-2022 //ArchanSen\]

**[Behind the EU's recent multiple sovereignty agendas is the need to
stay ahead of the curve when it comes to innovation]{.underline}**. The
very label of a geopolitical European Commission implies a new level of
engagement for the EU in the global balance of power. **[Technological
and digital sovereignty are at the heart of such
ambitions.]{.underline}**

**[The]{.underline}** outbreak of the coronavirus **[pandemic has
further exacerbated the urgency to shore up technological, digital, and
regulatory responses to preserve the EU's economic clout, industrial
competitiveness, and geopolitical influence, as well as to reduce
dependencies in critical technology areas.]{.underline}** What has the
EU done so far, and what must it still do to meet that goal of
technological sovereignty?

Four cross-cutting dimensions can help unpack the concept of
technological sovereignty and better structure the discussion about EU
initiatives, programs, and instruments:

Research and capability-development efforts in security and defense

Investments in cutting-edge research and innovation and in
digitalization

Critical infrastructure resilience and security of supply

Tech-related regulatory activism

DEFENSE CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT

According to Arnout Molenaar, the head of division in the European
External Action Service, **[dealing with security and defense policy is
also related to "a learning curve for the Union to develop a 'hard
power' mentality." Technology plays a fundamental role in terms of
making possible the EU's hard military power
ambitions]{.underline}**---not only to act in a tense geopolitical
setting but also to defend the EU's interests in areas related to
technology, security, and defense matters.

### Block -- INB -- A2: EU Tech Inevitable

#### Not inevitable -- we're on the brink -- it's only a question of what happens now. 

**Csernatoni 21** \[Raluca Csernatoni, 12-6-2021, \"The EU's Defense
Ambitions: Understanding the Emergence of a European Defense
Technological and Industrial Complex\", Carnegie Europe,

DOA: 6-20-2022 //ArchanSen\]

Also, **[[the emergence of a]{.mark} common [European approach
to]{.mark} security and [defense tech]{.mark}nological and industrial
matters [has not gone]{.mark} as [smoothly]{.mark} as
expected]{.underline}**. At the same time, the European Commission's
expanding competencies in these fields remains a sensitive issue to
other EU institutions and member states. **[This sensitivity reflects
long-standing [national protectionism related to]{.mark} the high
politics of security and [defense, and]{.mark} ongoing [competition with
other EU institutions]{.mark} and agencies, such as the EDA, over the
EU's security and defense policy agenda.]{.underline}**10

The above interrelated developments have all contributed to the EU
momentum to proceed on defense industrial and market integration. They
provide a link between the why, the who, and the how:

Why: **[[The European defense industry is at the crossroads of military
tech]{.mark}nological [development]{.mark}, owing to the lack of
national-level investment and unprecedented technological advancements
in the civilian sector.]{.underline}**

Who: The defense industry has had a growing role in setting EU policy
agendas and in shaping security and defense R&D initiatives.

How: The European Commission, and to a limited extent the European
Parliament, have a rising supranational role in EU security and defense
policy.11

STRATEGIC AUTONOMY ISN'T JUST DEFENSE, IT'S ALSO TECHNOLOGY

Over the past two decades, the **[impact of new and emerging
tech]{.underline}**nologies **[and increased
digitalization]{.underline}** have **[become the prime drivers of
globalization and international competition]{.underline}**.
**[States]{.underline}** around the world **[are making digital
autonomy]{.underline}**, **[tech]{.underline}**nological **[supremacy,
and innovation the cornerstones of their diplomatic, security, and
economic efforts]{.underline}**. **[The]{.underline}** European Union
**[(EU)]{.underline}** **[is no exception.]{.underline}** The
**[coronavirus]{.underline}** pandemic **[and]{.underline}** its
**[broader implications]{.underline}** have **[further
highlighted]{.underline}** the **[importance of digital transformation
in all aspects of society]{.underline}**, **[as well as the need to
reduce strategic dependencies in key, high-end technology areas, value
and supply chains, and critical infrastructures]{.underline}**.
**[Against the backdrop of a deteriorating geopolitical and security
environment]{.underline}**, **[it comes as no surprise that [European
digital and tech]{.mark}nological [sovereignty are at the center of
current EU policy discussions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** There are indeed
signs of a new and yet conceptually ambiguous narrative taking shape
around building the EU's technological innovation power. What exactly
are the practical and policy implications of a new "technological
sovereignty" narrative? And more importantly, what EU tech sovereignty
efforts have been made in line with broader European strategic autonomy
objectives? The **[[concept of European strategic autonomy
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** certainly **[[not new]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
It **[initially emerged in discussions related to the EU's space and
security and defense policy strategies, as well as [in terms of upping
the EU's game in military capability building]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Political discussions about European strategic autonomy indeed have a
long and controversial history. The **[term has deep historical roots
in]{.underline}** French **[strategic culture and
thinking]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** since the 1990s, it
**[has]{.underline}** typically **[referred to the notion that [the EU
should be able to carry out]{.mark} modest-size[, out-of-area, and
militarily well-equipped crisis management operations]{.mark},
[especially in its own neighborhood, and independently of the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited [**[S]{.underline}**]{.mark}tates
**[and]{.underline}** the **[N]{.underline}**orth
**[A]{.underline}**tlantic **[T]{.underline}**reaty
**[O]{.underline}**rganization. While the publication of the EU's Global
Strategy (EUGS) in June 2016 is credited for putting the concept of
strategic autonomy on the EU's foreign and security policy agendas, the
reality is that various **[[EU institutions]{.mark} and
member]{.underline}** state**[s have long been [discussing the need to
upgrade the EU's defense tech]{.mark}nological [and industrial portfolio
and crisis management capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Key to
such debates was the preservation of a competitive European Defence
Technological and Industrial Base.]{.underline}** In the words of Josep
Borrell, **[the EU's]{.underline}** high representative for foreign
affairs and security policy and vice president of the European
Commission, the **[concept of strategic autonomy is]{.underline}**
indeed **[not new]{.underline}**, as it has **[been [extensively used in
the military realm]{.mark} and for a long time was limited to issues
related to European security and defense]{.underline}**. According to
Borrell, [**[strategic autonomy is]{.underline}**]{.mark} also **[[a
"process of political survival" for the]{.mark} [EU, and its logic
should be expanded to other sectors]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This
**[narrow security and defense focus]{.underline}** has **[been recently
expanded by the geopolitically focused European
Commission]{.underline}** under President Ursula von der Leyen and
**[under the stated ambition to revamp the European power agenda in
various strategic sectors]{.underline}**. **[[The underlying
logic]{.mark} behind strategic autonomy has started to [increasingly
encompass]{.mark} discussions about technological protectionism and
capacity building in new domains related to [digitalization, data,
space, energy, and]{.mark} new and [emerging
tech]{.mark}nologies.]{.underline}** The **[[new
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nological
**[[sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}** narrative **[is [meant to build
EU-wide consensus around the need to preserve
Eu]{.mark}]{.underline}**ropean **[[leadership]{.mark} [and
autonomy]{.mark} in]{.underline}** various **[key
tech]{.underline}**nological **[areas]{.underline}**. It is the **[[EU's
attempt to put forward a]{.mark} pragmatic and [autonomous approach to
avoid dependencies and geopolitical coercion in critical
tech]{.mark}n]{.underline}**ological **[[sectors]{.mark}. The stakes
could not be higher.]{.underline}** Indeed, the incumbent commission has
started to actively circulate various notions of sovereignty derived
from discussions on strategic autonomy and defense sovereignty by
populating the discursive landscape with related concepts such as
technological, digital, and data sovereignty. This **[expansion is
revealing increasing fears that more protective autonomy in other policy
areas than security and defense is needed to safeguard the EU's economic
and strategic interests and European values]{.underline}**. **[Hence,
[the impact of terms such as sovereignty, power, and strategic
autonomy]{.mark} floating [around the technology]{.mark},
digitalization, and data [spheres should not be easily
disregarded.]{.mark}]{.underline}** These **[[terms give strategic
meaning to EU action and institutionalize different sectoral approaches
to sovereignty building]{.underline}]{.mark}**. They are also
**[[indicative of]{.underline}]{.mark}** recent **[[EU-led
policy]{.mark}, [regulatory, and funding efforts in the industrial,
technological, and digital domains]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But which are
the most significant initiatives designed to consolidate the EU's quest
for various sovereignties, and do they amount to a coherent and
integrated approach?

A digital vision

If **[the [EU]{.mark}]{.underline}** is to invest in setting up its own
digital and technology foreign policy, it **[[needs to be clear about
what its goals are]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The **[ultimate [aim]{.mark}
of this policy [should be to give]{.mark} the [EU]{.mark} both the
[strategy and]{.mark} the [tools to transform it into a global
tech]{.mark}nological [actor]{.mark} [able to sustain its interests and
values at home and abroad]{.mark}, and in competition and cooperation
with other powers]{.underline}**. All the **[elements laid out in this
brief are]{.underline}** therefore **[focused on turning the EU into a
capable and effective geopolitical actor in the field of digital
technology]{.underline}**. The need for such a strategy is clear. The EU
has set itself the goal of becoming a technologically advanced and
decarbonised economy. The **[success of]{.underline}** this **[major
economic transition]{.underline}** crucially **[depends on the EU's
capacity to master, command, and have full and unrestricted access to
critical digital technologies]{.underline}**. These technologies are
increasingly contested, disputed, and even weaponised by third actors.
Access to them may thus be denied or made conditional on political
goals, jeopardising this transition. In a worst-case scenario, rather
than allowing the EU to become a more autonomous and powerful actor, the
transition to a digital and decarbonised economy may create new
vulnerabilities and simply change the nature of the EU's geopolitical
and economic dependence. The future of the EU also depends on its
capacity to sustain democracy and democratic institutions, both at home
and abroad. However, for 15 consecutive years, democracy has been in
decline around the world, both in the number and in the quality of
democracies. Coincident with this decline, both born-again and
long-standing authoritarian regimes are growing stronger and more
challenging. Misuse of digital technologies has contributed to these
trends. This not only serves to undermine democracies by fuelling
political polarisation and providing the tools for foreign influence
operations, but it also helps authoritarian governments cement their
grip on their citizens. Countering these trends is not only a moral
necessity for the EU but also essential to securing its global
interests. The **[[vision]{.mark} behind EU digital policy
[should]{.mark}]{.underline}** thus [**[be to secure and promote both
its economic power base and its political model]{.underline}**, **[at
home and globally]{.underline}**]{.mark}. To achieve this vision, **[the
[EU needs to act strategically]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Acting
strategically means that in [designing its means and ends, the union
needs to understand what other countries and powers are doing and how it
plans to compete and cooperate with them]{.mark}]{.underline}**. China
and Russia have started a process of decoupling from the West, to which
they seek to attract other countries. The rules-based order is being
replaced by a power-based order. Geoeconomics (or sheer mercantilism) is
back. **[[States are using economic and tech]{.mark}nological
[interdependencies to impose their views]{.mark} [and secure their
geopolitical interests]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is a new world order
-- and in that world, technology becomes a key element of power,
sovereignty, and survival. **[[To secure its
interests]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[values, and global
standing]{.mark}, the]{.underline}** **[[EU should embed its open-market
and humancentric approach to tech]{.mark}nology [in its alliances,
partnerships, and the multilateral organisations]{.mark} to which it
belongs]{.underline}**. In a world where technology is disputed and
weaponised, **[[the more technologically sovereign like-minded countries
are]{.mark}, [the more the EU's own sovereignty and its global
geo-tech]{.mark}nology [standing are assured]{.mark}; [the more allies
are protected against foreign influence operations, cyberattacks, and
coercion derived from technological vulnerabilities, the more alignment
and coop]{.mark}eration [with the EU at the global level will be
facilitated]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The **[[EU should therefore
aim]{.underline}]{.mark}** not at technological independence but **[at
mutually reinforced and [shared technological sovereignty with its
allies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[To achieve this aim, the [EU]{.mark}
first [needs to become an attractive partner]{.mark} for other
countries]{.underline}**. This **[attraction should extend to those who
have signed up to Chinese digital infrastructures and investments or are
targeted by China's, Russia's, and other countries' propaganda and
influence operations]{.underline}**. The Global Gateway initiative can
help this process if it focuses on strategic opportunities to strengthen
alliances and undermine Chinese and Russian spheres of influence. The EU
also needs to strengthen its existing alliances. This need affects first
and most fundamentally the US, but also applies to other partners. With
the US, which in many fields is a technology competitor, the EU must
settle its differences. **[[The EU and the US have distinct approaches
to tech]{.mark}nology [governance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[In Europe,
values and regulation play a greater role than they do in the
US]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This **[distinction has]{.underline}** so far
**[prevented regulatory harmonisation and led to
tensions]{.underline}**. Still, **[while]{.underline}** these
[**[differences may prevent policy harmonisation]{.underline}**, **[they
should still allow policy convergence]{.underline}**]{.mark}, or at
least coexistence -- particularly given the common global challenges the
EU and the US face. Clearly, the EU and the US cannot counter Russia's
and China's aggressive technological strategies while refusing to
compromise among themselves. Much as they did after the second world
war, the US and Europe need to reach a wide agreement to sustain a
global and free democratic technology order. The postwar order required
rules-based institutions and military alliances to secure free trade
across key straits and blue waters. The new order will require the
transatlantic alliance to work together to facilitate a flow of data
that preserves privacy, and to embed democratic values in technology
regulations and governance at the global level. In sum, to stand up for
its interests and values, **[[the EU must become a global technology
player]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The EU and its member states can deliver
on this vision by acting along three policy dimensions (values,
security, and markets) with a common strategy and new and enhanced
policy tools. As the next section shows, the EU is already on the road
to global influence in technology. But it has a long way to go, and the
most difficult part still lies ahead.

A stronger European defense to strengthen NATO's posture While the
**[EU]{.underline}** has made significant progress in countering hybrid
warfare since Russia's annexation of Crimea, the same cannot be said
with regard to developing more effective traditional deterrence
capabilities. Such **[capabilities are increasingly necessary, not just
because of Russia's aggressive posture]{.underline}** --- expanding its
area of operations beyond the post-Soviet space to Syria and Africa ---
**[but also because of the growing geopolitical and security alignment
between Beijing and Moscow.]{.underline}**

Since 2014, **[cooperation between China and Russia has
expanded]{.underline}** beyond the domain of arm sales. The two
countries have supported each other's development of strategic weapons
(such as for missile defense) and artificial intelligence, as well as
each other's political positions in the United Nations Security
Council.41 Beijing and Moscow have deepened their interactions in
Africa, where Russian Wagner Group mercenaries patrol Chinese
facilities,42 and conducted military exercises including a shared air
patrol in the Asia-Pacific region.43 They also have been **[seeking
common ground on Afghanistan since the departure of U.S.
troops]{.underline}**.44 Such alignment is increasingly **[resembling a
partnership that is reflected at the military level too]{.underline}**.
After the past year's military drills in the Mediterranean, the Baltic
Sea, and the Indo-Pacific, China and Russia recently conducted a joint
military exercise called Zapad/Interaction-2021 in China's northwestern
region of Ningxia, where **[for the first time they used a joint command
and control system and shared equipment --- mimicking the way NATO
forces work with each other]{.underline}**.45 Meanwhile, the **[United
States has begun to shift its security focus toward the IndoPacific
region and South China Sea where Beijing is threatening
Taiwan]{.underline}**. **[Consequently]{.underline}**, **[should a
direct confrontation with China occur in the medium to long term, Russia
could take advantage of the situation and potentially target Europe
while U.S. forces and attentions are directed elsewhere]{.underline}**.
For this reason, **[it is crucial for European allies to have the
military capabilities to push back against Russia with little support
from the United States]{.underline}**, at least in the initial phases.
**[With more defense capabilities, European allies would also have the
resources to respond to crises that arise in the Mediterranean
region]{.underline}**. After four years of strained trans-Atlantic
relations --- where the defense spending issue has intoxicated the
broader debate on trans-Atlantic security --- **[a stronger European
defense would help Washington recognize the increased geopolitical
cohesion and security concerns of the bloc]{.underline}**.
Unfortunately, as described earlier, such capability has yet to be
achieved. A **[RAND Corporation wargaming simulation exercise assessed
that in the case of a conventional attack by the Russian Federation,
Moscow's forces would be able to reach the outskirts of either the
Estonian or Latvian capital in around 60 hours, and the NATO allies
would not be able to defend these territories because of a (totally
fillable) shortage of military capabilities]{.underline}**.46 Similarly,
a **[scenario analysis by the International Institute for Strategic
Studies argued that without the help of the United States, conventional
forces from European NATO countries would not be able to push back
against the hypothetical conquest of Lithuania and part of Poland by the
Russian Federation]{.underline}**.47 **[To ensure that they can
successfully respond to a land attack from Russia, or a coordinated
Russia-China operation, Europeans need to increase the quality and
readiness of their defense apparatus.]{.underline}** A policy brief by
the NATO Defense College calls for multinational battlegroups in Poland
and in the Baltics to increase their readiness in terms of support
capabilities, such as artillery and air defense, and for European allies
to fulfill their NATO 2018 Readiness commitment of providing several
land combat brigades and maritime task groups.48 The authors also point
out that to increase deterrence, **[European allies need sufficient and
effective air and missile defense capabilities to protect critical
infrastructure, as well as long-range conventional precision-strike
weapons to limit Russia's options for regional conventional
attacks]{.underline}**.

All these analyses indicate that **[expanded capabilities on the
European side are crucial for a stronger NATO posture.]{.underline}**
Political tensions around the branding of European strategic autonomy
have unfortunately poisoned this debate and complicated a very simple
issue: **[European forces must be able to take effective action with or
without the United States in the theaters that are crucial for European
security.]{.underline}**

European and US interviewees came up with several arguments pointing to
the **[benefits of a strong European pillar not only for NATO and the
EU]{.underline}**, but **[also outweigh]{.underline}**ing **[the
challenges that may emerge in the process]{.underline}**. Whether these
efforts come under the umbrella of European strategic autonomy and
EU-level defence integration or via bi- and multi-lateral programmes, or
some combination of both, did not make a substantive difference to the
well-shared perception that **[a more capable Europe is good for NATO
and good for the transatlantic partnership]{.underline}**. **[A less
engaged, less capable, less coherent and less reliable European pillar
of NATO is unlikely to be capable of meaningful burden
sharing]{.underline}**. And **[from a US national perspective,
justifying investment in European defence matters to the U.S. public
would be very difficult if European nations choose not to invest in
strengthening their contribution to NATO]{.underline}**. While **[a weak
Europe]{.underline}** (our Scenario 2) would require least policy effort
and resources, it **[would]{.underline}** also **[be the one with least
benefits for NATO and the U.S., particularly as it looks for allies in
an emerging systemic competition with China]{.underline}**. Naturally,
the question arises as to whether the pursuit of European strategic
autonomy is the 'right way of going about it', and whether the lack of
clarity in relation to the concept creates more problems than it solves
when it comes to the transatlantic relations. All in all, **[despite the
risks]{.underline}** of misunderstanding and miscommunication, the
concept of **[European strategic autonomy, if underpinned by continuing
defence consolidation, does seem to offer a unifying principle for a
much needed defence integration to enable the EU to take up greater
responsibilities for its defence and security matters.]{.underline}**

Synergies in procurement and capability development As with the cyber
domain, **[NATO and the EU could respond to outside pressure by
increasing and improving procurement and technological
cooperation]{.underline}**. The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered
shortages and vulnerabilities in the supply chain, and the competition
for rare earth material and high-technology products (such as
microchips) has increased. Meanwhile, **[breakthrough technological
achievements are opening new frontiers for competition in the security
domain]{.underline}**. First, **[European allies could]{.underline}**
**[better coordinate]{.underline}** their **[defense spending within the
framework of the European Union]{.underline}**; the **[absence of an
integrated defense structure inevitably leads to duplications and wasted
resources]{.underline}**. Moreover, the armed forces of different
European countries may encounter difficulties in operating with one
another, given that there are 138 defense systems in Europe (compared to
only 30 in the United States).70 As stated in a European Commission
report, the **[lack of cooperation in the European defense industry
produces a loss of 25 billion to 100 billion euros per year, while 30%
of the costs could be saved if a joint procurement was in
place]{.underline}**.71 In the United States, several commentators point
out that a more integrated procurement system at the European level will
negatively impact U.S.-EU trade relations in the defense industry.72
**[Although some economic losses for the United States are indeed
possible, there are ways to contain them and of course an EU with a
stronger defense would make a more reliable partner for the United
States. In fact, the U.S. and EU are currently discussing administrative
agreements with the EDA to allow the United States to participate in
PESCO projects.]{.underline}** Through a franker dialogue, **[the two
sides of the Atlantic could strengthen the defense market without
resorting to protectionist stances on either side. This is particularly
relevant considering the strong ties between the U.S. and EU defense
industries; they both could benefit from deeper cooperation and
exchanges on the technological level, and from free and fair competition
in the trans-Atlantic defense market based on common rules and
standards]{.underline}**. On this point, **[the EU could leverage
resources from the European Defense Fund and the European Commission's
Horizon 2020 program to develop new technologies and fill security
gaps.]{.underline}** **[Both the fund and program are relatively young
and would benefit from a deeper exchange with NATO --- whose experience
in military procurement is unrivalled --- to help define standards as
well as characteristics of the technology]{.underline}**. NATO and the
EU address capability development in markedly different ways. NATO
focuses more on procuring a given item from a given state to meet a
specific need of the alliance, whereas the EU focuses more on filling
capability gaps and encouraging member states to cooperate to develop
new assets. In this regard, the **[EU appears to have a]{.underline}**
**[comparative advantage]{.underline}** **[given the role of the
European Defense Agency to go beyond specific operational requirements
and its ability to consider long-term trends and ways member states can
cooperate on the development of new capabilities]{.underline}**. In
particular, the **[EU defense procurement benefits from strong support
from EU-led research and development programs]{.underline}**, **[as well
as]{.underline}** from **[considerable financial
resources]{.underline}** **[from the European Defense
Fund]{.underline}**. As European defense capabilities advance, there
will be **[overlap]{.underline}** **[between the EU Capability
Development Priorities and the NATO Defense Planning
Process]{.underline}**; this **[gives the EU and NATO an
opportunity]{.underline}** **[to foster]{.underline}** **[greater
cooperation]{.underline}** **[and build up a more efficient and
competitive trans-atlantic defense]{.underline}**.73 A recent study from
the French Institute of International Relations identifies areas where
defense requirements could be harmonized and where the **[EU and NATO
could work on joint research projects: from cyberdefense, air
superiority, logistics, and medical support capabilities to science and
technology, arms control, and intelligence]{.underline}**.74 A **[more
synchronized approach]{.underline}** in these areas --- that would also
entail a joint assessment of member state performances --- **[will
undoubtedly reinforce both NATO- and EU-led operations as well as
deterrence]{.underline}**.

Americans who are truly committed to the idea of a Europe "whole and
free" should realize that **[[NATO]{.mark} is [no longer the]{.mark}
main [spinal cord]{.mark} of the European project]{.underline}**;
**[[the E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion [is]{.mark}]{.underline}**. When
George H. W. Bush coined the phrase in 1989, the level of intra-European
integration was arguably on par with the defense alliance as providing
stability and prosperity to the continent, and Americans were still
heavily involved in both. Remember, this was pre-Maastricht Treaty,
before the EU itself. Three decades of political, economic, and monetary
integration later --- and 16 new members later --- the European Union is
deeply entrenched in the lives of Europeans.

Today, **[28 [European democracies]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which used to
compete among themselves and sometimes fight to their ultimate demise,
now choose to **[[pool sovereignty and have]{.underline}]{.mark}** their
**[[interests communally discussed and]{.mark} collectively
[defended]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The **[EU is [a power
multiplier]{.mark}]{.underline}**: **[[Every one]{.mark} of the 28 [has
a stronger]{.mark} individual [voice]{.mark}]{.underline}** because they
stand together in the European Union. **[[Small]{.mark} European
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**, whose geography and demography would
force them to cave to stronger neighbors, can now **[[count on]{.mark}
the [solidarity]{.mark} of the group]{.underline}** --- as illustrated
by the unwavering support for Ireland by the other 26 member states and
the Brussels institutions in the Brexit negotiations.

The neighbors of the European Union are no fools. Those who seek
prosperity and stability hope to join the EU club. Those who reject the
model set by the West and liberal democracies feel threatened by the
European Union --- it is the prospect of Ukraine moving into the EU's
orbit through an Association Agreement that triggered Russia's hostility
and ultimate aggression, not NATO. The power of attraction of the
**[European Union]{.underline}**, at least as much as the security
guarantees of NATO, has helped **[stabilize Eastern
Europe]{.underline}**.

**[Despite these realities]{.underline}**, **[Americans]{.underline}**
often **[indulge in]{.underline}** a **[scornful disregard for the
EU]{.underline}**. Recently, **[benign contempt]{.underline}** has
**[taken an ugly turn]{.underline}**. Since taking office, President
Trump and his administration have attacked the European Union and
individual member states repeatedly, with near impunity.

At first sight, American complaints appear to be centered on the issue
of Europe's trading power, which rivals that of the United States. For
Donald Trump, the EU was created to "take advantage of" the United
States and it is "worse than China." Early in his mandate, the American
president pushed for tariffs on steel and aluminum and threatened to go
after automobiles, until a meeting with EU Commission President Juncker
put a brake on the downward spiral.

However, a deeper look reveals a fundamental ideological contention: The
brand of nationalism and populism that defines this administration
stands in direct contradiction with the very existence of a liberal,
supra-national body such as the European Union.

As laid out by the State Department's Director of Policy Planning Kiron
Skinner in December 2018, the administration holds the view that
"international institutions have steadily encroached on the rights of
sovereign nations" and that "nothing can replace the nation-state as the
guarantor of democratic freedoms and national interests" --- an
indictment of the EU's very existence. The ideological clash is
reminiscent of older times. Addressing a crowd in Warsaw in July 2017,
President Trump likened the European Union to the Soviet Union,
criticizing a similar "steady creep of government bureaucracy that
drains the vitality and wealth of the people," an equivalency popular in
conservative circles. Similarly, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
suggested in a December 2018 speech in Brussels that EU bureaucrats were
not really working for the interests of European citizens.

By making no secret of his personal support for euroskeptic forces,
Donald Trump has become an active political opponent of the European
Union in its existing form. He celebrated the Brexit vote, expressed
support for far-right candidate Marine Le Pen ahead of the French
presidential elections, disparaged Angela Merkel repeatedly, and
appeared to rejoice at the Yellow Vests protest movement. He criticized
Theresa May for negotiating a "soft" Brexit, and even recommended to
Emmanuel Macron that France leave the EU. The American president has
nominated ambassadors famously critical of the EU, and his
administration demoted the EU ambassador's status without notification,
before reversing under criticism.

As Donald Trump torments both the Atlantic alliance and the European
Union, all rush to NATO's bedside, and few worry about the EU.
Truthfully, Atlanticists love to love NATO. It stands for values, valor,
unity, solidarity. NATO won the Cold War. Celebrating NATO is
celebrating the military. It is much harder to love the EU, the
bureaucracy, the politics, the regulations. The EU lacks democratic
appeal, and its slow-moving decisionmaking process create many
frustrations. Unlike in NATO, the United States sits on the sidelines,
it does not control who enters, or who stays in. The EU is also an
economic peer competitor, a tough trading partner, and a sovereign
international actor, at times non-compliant with American demands.

Yet, the **[prospect of]{.underline}** an **[[implosion of the
E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion]{.underline}** should be as
**[[unbearable]{.mark} and intolerable]{.underline}** to an American
audience as the dissolution of NATO --- or more so, as no one wants to
see the **[[demons of nationalism]{.mark} back on the European
continent]{.underline}**, along with a **[[global economic
catastrophe]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Benign **[[neglect is
counterproductive]{.underline}]{.mark}**; but a **[policy openly hostile
to the European Union is [a grave mistake]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In a
world where the strongmen are striking back, **[Americans should not
forget]{.underline}** that **[the European Union]{.underline}** stands
with the United States when it matters most. The NATO summit in
Washington this week should be the occasion to recall not only the
utmost importance of the Atlantic alliance to trans-Atlantic security,
but also the crucial contribution of the European Union to peace, unity,
and ultimately security for Europe and beyond.

A WORLD OF BIOLOGICAL POSSIBILITIES Mutual [self-interest
provides]{.underline} a [strong basis for transatlantic
coop]{.underline}eration [in biotech]{.underline}nology [based on shared
recognition of its vast potential to provide solutions to some of
civilization's most pressing problems]{.underline}. Thanks to explosive
advances in our understanding of the many ways in which promiscuous
nature has been manipulating DNA and RNA for the past billion years, it
is widely anticipated that the 21st century will belong to biology.1 [We
are]{.underline} now [at the point where our ability to innovate is
constrained less by technical capability than by the limits of our
imaginations]{.underline}. Multiple [lab]{.underline}oratorie[s and
companies on both sides of the Atlantic]{.underline} (and throughout the
world) [are pursuing]{.underline} promising [applications]{.underline},
[and experience confirms progress would be **accelerated** by
cooperative approaches]{.underline}. But there are some considerable
challenges, especially in agricultural and industrial contexts. The most
important rate-limiting factor in our ability to harness biological
innovations to the challenges of feeding the world, sustaining human and
environmental health, and addressing climate change, is the burden
imposed by ill-considered regulations. Unless this bottleneck can be
unblocked, the enormous potential for transatlantic scientific
cooperation will not yield the necessary fruits. DIVERGENT REGULATORY
PATHS: PRECAUTION VS. OPENNESS TO INNOVATION [Existing
policies]{.underline}, [legislation]{.underline}, [and
reg]{.underline}ulation[s do little]{.underline} or nothing [to advance
human or environmental safety]{.underline}.2 Born out of understandable
caution at the dawn of recombinant DNA technologies, today their most
obvious impact is to obstruct and discourage research, development, and
deployment of innovative solutions to various challenges.3 This is so
despite an abundant record of production and consumption of new biotech
products with enviable records of improved safety, superior
sustainability, and widespread beneficial economic impacts.4 The
benefits are so substantial that a pattern has emerged of farmers
breaking the law to acquire and plant improved seeds in countries where
governments have lagged in allowing access.5 It is one thing to
implement policies and regulations ostensibly designed to ensure safety;
it is quite another to ignore vast data and decades of experience around
the world to maintain obsolete policies and regulations that add nothing
to safety or sustainability, but only impede our ability to use the most
innovative, precise, and safest tools to address our gravest
challenges.6 In terms of regulatory policy and openness to biological
innovations, the width of the Atlantic might be measured better in light
years than miles or kilometers. [As imperfect as
reg]{.underline}ulation[s]{.underline} [for]{.underline} the products of
[biotech]{.underline}nology [are in]{.underline} North
[America]{.underline}, [they are]{.underline} simply [**indefensible**
in Europe]{.underline}.7 The United States decided in 1986, after years
of study and consultation, that no new laws were required to ensure the
safety of crops and foods improved through biotechnology. This was based
on the finding that they present no novel hazards, and foreseeable risks
of their development and use fall into categories with which humans have
considerable experience from millennia of conventional plant and animal
breeding.8 The United States therefore decided to regulate these novel
products under existing authorities administered by the Department of
Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and Environmental
Protection Agency.9 While implementation of this policy, the
"Coordinated Framework," has been far from perfect, it has been
sufficiently predictable and science-based to enable an explosion of
innovation, new product development, and commercial activity.
Consequently, the United States has led the world to the present day
wherein crops improved through biotechnology are now the global standard
for quality seeds, delivering improved yields, safety, sustainability,
and economic productivity around the world, with the lion's share of
benefits accruing on behalf of small farmers in developing countries.10
Europe took a different approach. It is one thing to implement policies
and regulations ostensibly designed to ensure safety; it is quite
another to ignore vast data and decades of experience around the world
to maintain obsolete policies and regulations that add nothing to safety
or sustainability. [The E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion
[decided to regulate seeds]{.underline} improved [through
biotech]{.underline}nology as a novel class governed under new
regulations specifically focused on an arbitrary category known as
"GMOs" (for "genetically modified organisms"). The conceit was that
because they represented gene combinations produced by mechanisms
supposedly "not found in nature" (but actually ubiquitous) they must
present novel hazards, even though none has ever been identified. These
putatively novel hazards, despite the lack of any concrete
manifestations, allegedly required dedicated, specific, "precautionary"
regulations. The resulting regulatory regime proved so burdensome it led
to the general collapse of agricultural biotechnology in Europe, which
had played a leading role in its discovery and invention. Permissions
for field trials proved almost impossible to obtain, products could not
be developed and brought to market, academic labs abandoned the field,
and the industry relocated most of its assets and activities to the
Americas. And Europe became the world's largest importer of commodity
foods improved through biotechnology, only recently surpassed by China.
OPPORTUNITY FOR TRANSATLANTIC COOPERATION Many [scientists in the
EU]{.underline} (and around the world) [knew from the beginning that
this was the **wrong approach**]{.underline}, [yet the EU pushed its
model internationally, with aggressive diplomacy, leading to emulation
by many countries in the developing world, with equally unhappy results
to those seen in Europe]{.underline}.11 [But a growing number of
scientists, policymakers, and even "green" NGOs that had originally
opposed GMOs, now recognize the counterproductive results of this
approach and are **working to avoid** repeating the same mistakes with
gene editing]{.underline}. [This shines a spotlight on the most
important and potentially fruitful opportunity for transatlantic
cooperation in biotechnology: the **revival** of **science-based**
regulatory regimes in which the degree of regulatory **oversight** is
**proportional** to the **hazards** involved, and regulation that
enables]{.underline}, rather than discourages [the safe development of
innovative products.]{.underline} [A return to and reaffirmation of
these first principles would provide fertile ground for **cooperation**
and **coordination globally**.]{.underline} Regulatory reform
(everywhere, not just in the EU and its emulators, though the need is
greatest there) provides fertile ground for transatlantic cooperation
and coordination. We have robust models of proven approaches.12 [Without
such cooperation, other progress in developing and deploying innovative
solutions through biotechnology will be **impeded** or
**foregone**.]{.underline} As to national security risks, just as with
other risks, novelty attributable to biotechnology is elusive. One can
do very nasty things with conventional bioweapons, and they are easily
magnified with recombinant DNA techniques. At the same time, defensive
capacities are also buttressed by biotechnology, as demonstrated by the
rapid development of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. There has been
some good work done in this area, but this topic is worth exploring at
greater depth. The OECD has a track record of thoughtful analyses with
such topics. One possibility would be to build on that foundation by
establishing a joint OECD/NATO working group to serve as a forum.

[In a more and more connected world cyberspace has become the **fifth
battlespace**]{.underline}. The [latest Pegasus case]{.underline},
refereeing to a spying hardware which affected many European heads of
states and government in the Summer of 2021, [shows how much cyber
threats are now part of the international security arena]{.underline}.
NATO has tackled the cyber topic for over a decade. NATO's awareness
towards cyber threats started raising in the late 1990s, following
cyberattacks by Serbian hackers against NATO Supreme Command's (SHAPE)
website during the air bombing campaign on Serbian positions in the
frame of the Kosovo war. The [cyberattacks against Estonia
in]{.underline} 20[07 and]{.underline} in the context of the [conflict
in Georgia in]{.underline} 20[08]{.underline} [urged the Alliance to
take]{.underline} this [new threats seriously]{.underline}. NATO is
today the most advanced international organisation regarding cyber
defence. With a cyber command structure set up in 2008, its [2010
Strategic Concept has enabled it to lay the foundations of its vision
for cyber defence]{.underline}. Indeed NATO frames cyber threats as a
direct challenge for transatlantic and national security as stated in
the 2010 Strategic Concept. The Alliance approved its first Policy on
Cyber Defence in 2008 (revised in 2011 and 2014) and established a Cyber
Defence Management Authority (CDMA) in 2008 and even a Cybersecurity
Operations Centre within NATO Command Structure in 2018. [The Strategic
Concept]{.underline} adopted in November 2010 in Lisbon [fully
acknowledges cyber defence capabilities as a necessity for the
Alliance]{.underline}. NATO [also created tools to prevent cyber-attacks
and cyber o]{.underline}ffensive [c]{.underline}apabilitie[s with a
central objective: to defend the Alliance's own **comm**unication**s**
and **info**rmation **systems** and to arouse its member states'
awareness on the need to protect critical infrastructures implied in
contemporary military operations.]{.underline} At the [NATO Summit in
Wales]{.underline} in September 2014, the organisation crossed a new
important threshold by recognizing cyber defence as part of the
Alliance's core task of collective defence and therefore [included cyber
threats as relevant article V material]{.underline}. This [concretely
means that NATO could trigger]{.underline} the [**article
V**]{.underline} of the Washington Treaty [in case of a massive cyber
attack with lethal implications against one of its members]{.underline}.
Yet such a case would raise the difficult question of the attribution of
the cyberattack. Such an [attribution to a specific]{.underline} state
or state-sponsored [hacker would necessitate a consensus among the
member states within]{.underline} the [N]{.underline}orth
[A]{.underline}tlantic [C]{.underline}ouncil, [which would]{.underline}
probably [make it difficult as it tackles]{.underline} diplomatic
strings and [strategic priorities which]{.underline} keep
[diverg]{.underline}ing [among]{.underline} the [**EU** member
states.]{.underline} Indeed attribution continues to be a competence of
member states until now, and not of NATO as such. Since 2014 NATO
regularly reaffirms the importance of cyber defence as one of the core
tasks of the Alliance, as it has been done during the Alliance's summit
in Brussels in June 2021: NATO endorsed a new Comprehensive Cyber
Defence Policy supporting the three main priorities of the Alliance
(collective defence, crisis management and cooperative security). The
member states also agreed to commit to making use of the full range of
capabilities to actively deter, defend against and counter the full
spectrum of cyber threats at all times. Aside from these policy aspects,
NATO also develops a wide range of tools and capabilities in the area of
cyber defence, with the aim of being able to provide assistance to its
member states in case of cyber-attack. It should also be acknowledged
that NATO owns its information and computer networks used in NATO
military missions, whereas in the case the EU for instance, [the EU
depends on the members states ICT infrastructures for CSDP
missions]{.underline}. NATO set up a specific agency dedicated to cyber
defence in 2012 at its SHAPE headquarters: the NATO Communications and
Information Agency (NCI Agency), which hosts since 2016 a Cyber Security
Operations Center (CyOC) dealing with around 500 cyber incidents each
month and responsible for the cyber defence of NATO's information and
computer infrastructures in the world and on military theatres (like in
Afghanistan until August 2021 for instance). This Cyber Operation Center
should be fully operational in 2023. In addition to these tools the
Alliance created a Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence
(CCDCOE) in Tallinn, which is a research and training facility dealing
with cyber defence education, research and development. The main task of
the Centre is to provide expertise on cyber defence, and organise cyber
exercises involving both NATO Allies and partners. These tools are
completed with NATO's smart defence initiatives entailing cyber defence
aspects and aiming at bringing member states to cooperate to develop and
maintain capabilities they could not afford to develop or alone. The
Alliance develops yearly exercises under the label Cyber Coalition. The
development of NATO cyber capabilities over the last 15 years clearly
shows that NATO started developing its own cyber defence culture. The
organization therefore issued a Cyber Defense Pledge at the Warsaw
summit in 2019 to facilitate cyber cooperation among its member states.
As a follow up, France decided to host the first international
conference in Paris in 2018 gathering the 29 NATO member states and the
Secretary General of the Alliance to urge its allies to keep developing
strategic thinking on cyber issues. Last but not least,
**[NATO]{.underline} also [develops]{.underline} an [important
cooperation with the EU on cyber defence]{.underline}**. [Both
organizations have enhanced their cooperation in cyber defence since
their joint declaration at the Alliance summit]{.underline} in Warsaw
[in 2016.]{.underline} [They regularly organize common training and
exercises and develop information sharing in order to raise
mutual]{.underline}. [Cooperation is even more needed in a context of
**limited financial resources**: some experts suggest using the Berlin
Plus agreements in cyber defence]{.underline}. The [EU and NATO have
also concluded a technical agreement between their response teams for
cyber incidents]{.underline} (NCIRC and CERT-EU) in February 2016 [to
intensify their cooperation on cyber defence]{.underline}. This
**[agreement has been enforced to discuss cyber threats in the context
of]{.underline}** 2019 [European elections]{.underline} for instance.
NATO also started a partnership with industry through the NATO Industry
Cyber Partnership (NICP). More precisely the Alliance develops links
with computer firms such as Microsoft, Atos, Thales, Cisco or Apple. The
[panorama of NATO's cyberdefence assets shows therefore that the
Alliance takes cyber threats seriously and dedicates resources and
reflection to the topic]{.underline}. [Even though NATO could not decide
itself to trigger article V against a cyber aggressor, its member states
have the **common framework** enabling them to act, should they manifest
the **political will** to do so.]{.underline}

#### Continued EU development of emerging tech development strategies is critical to solidify the EU's model as the global standard for tech regulation

The EU: a geo-technology player in the making

In the last decade, **[the EU has]{.underline}** gradually **[woken up
to the geopolitical implications of digital tech]{.underline}**nologies.
This awakening can be linked to a series of events beginning in 2013
with the disclosures by former NSA employee Edward Snowden followed by
Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, the Brexit
referendum, the 2019 European Parliament election, and various EU member
states' national elections. The Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018
helped put the spotlight on big US technology companies and the need to
better regulate them. Similarly, the onset of international discussions
over the Chinese 5G provider Huawei that same year raised greater
awareness of EU technology vulnerabilities. In parallel to this, **[the
global impact of the EU's 2018 General Data Protection
Regulation]{.underline}** (GDPR), even if unexpected, **[turned the EU
into a global tech]{.underline}**nology **[actor and showed it the way
to leverage the attractiveness and power of its internal
market.]{.underline}** **[Equipped with]{.underline}** these
**[influential regulatory tools]{.underline}**, **[the EU is now seeking
to become the global leader in the regulation of digital
tech]{.underline}**nologies. EU digital legislation is no longer just
inward-looking. **[The union]{.underline}** now **[proactively seeks to
leverage its regulatory capacity and nurture digital partnerships and
alliances to globally project its values]{.underline}**. Building on
previous successes, **[the EU is now in the process of implementing
innovative regulatory regimes for AI,]{.underline}** **[data
governance]{.underline}**, **[and digital platforms that]{.underline}**,
like the GDPR, **[have the potential to go global.]{.underline}** This
**[new geopolitical logic underpins several new EU geo-technology
initiatives]{.underline}**. In the EU-US TTC, launched in 2021, the
union and the US are currently negotiating enhanced cooperation in
technology and standards development, digital regulation, connectivity
investments, and the security aspects of advanced technologies. The
swift and harmonised EU and US export controls on advanced technologies
imposed on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine in February this year
are the first success story of this new transatlantic technology
cooperation. Beyond the EU-US TTC, **[the EU has announced a new TTC
with India]{.underline}**, **[launched its first digital partnership
with Japan]{.underline}**, **[while negotiating additional partnerships
with Singapore and So]{.underline}**uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea. With
the Global Gateway initiative, **[the EU seeks to link digital
development investments in lower income countries with values-based
digital regulation and geopolitical thinking.]{.underline}** The
**[EU]{.underline}** has also **[taken steps to reduce its
tech]{.underline}**nological **[vulnerabilities and asymmetric
dependencies through investment in technological
capabilities]{.underline}**. These efforts have been heavily influenced
by China's technological assertiveness, the US-EU technology clashes
during the Trump administration, and most recently the Russian invasion
of Ukraine. Along these lines, **[the EU has developed new instruments
and cooperation mechanisms]{.underline}**, **[such as the Toolbox for 5G
security and the Joint Cyber Unit, to secure EU
cyberspace]{.underline}** To further strengthen its technological
capabilities and reduce its asymmetric dependencies, **[the union is
decisively investing in the development of critical
tech]{.underline}**nologies **[including semiconductors]{.underline}**,
through the European Chips Act; **[supercomputing]{.underline}**,
through the European High-Performance Computing Joint Undertaking;
**[and 6G development]{.underline}**, for example, through the Hexa-X
project. Moreover, **[the EU has rolled out a host of strategies
addressing issues at the nexus of digital tech]{.underline}**nology
**[and geopolitics]{.underline}**, **[including the 2030 Digital
Compass, the Strategic Compass, the Cybersecurity Strategy, and the
Standardisation Strategy]{.underline}**. The breadth of the issues
addressed in these various efforts underscore the ubiquity of
geo-technological dynamics across diverse policy fields. While the EU
was building its digital standing, Russia invaded Ukraine for the second
time. As so often, war became an accelerator of existing trends. Long
before Russia's invasion on 24 February, Ukraine had become ground zero
for Russian digital and hybrid warfare, with hundreds of thousands of
cyber-attacks and mass disinformation campaigns intended to destabilise
the country, undermine Ukraine's democratically elected government,
confuse Western public opinion, and ensure the global south will rally
around Russia. In its response to the war, the West has deployed massive
sanctions on advanced technologies with the intention of paralysing
Russia's industrial base and weakening its military capabilities. And
while the Kremlin has prohibited and blocked several foreign digital
platforms in Russia to impede the flow of outside information into the
country, many other Western technology companies independently decided
to cease operating in Russia. Both developments foreshadow a new digital
iron curtain. The **[war in Ukraine has]{.underline}** already
**[demonstrated that digital tech]{.underline}**nologies now **[shape
the response to international conflict.]{.underline}** The legislative
and policy measures taken so far by the EU are commendable. However,
there is still much to do. The EU continues to be a technology research
powerhouse, but its success in the commercialisation and the securing of
significant market shares in digital technologies has been limited.
Today, Europe is lagging in the development of advanced technologies
including semiconductors, AI, and cloud and high-performance computing.
As the EU rolls out initiative after initiative, a cohesive strategy is
missing to tie these measures together to improve coordination, set
priorities, and identify gaps. Due to a lack of information, resources,
and engagement the union is currently not realising its full potential
-- and not reaping the full geopolitical benefits of its digital policy
efforts. Because such an overarching framework is lacking, important
information is not flowing between the relevant Brussels and member
state institutions and towards the EU delegations around the world that
play a crucial role in forwarding European digital foreign policy
interests. Both the European Commission and the member states have
identified these challenges. The commission's 2030 Digital Compass,
approved in March 2020, said that the EU needs a "comprehensive and
coordinated approach to digital coalition-building and diplomatic
outreach". This is a position shared by the member states, which at the
12 July 2021 Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) called for the EU high
representative and vice president (HRVP) and the commission "to
formulate a comprehensive, ambitious European external digital policy in
coherence with existing internal policies". The diagnosis is clear. If
the EU wants to become a global technology actor, it must develop and
deploy digital diplomacy tools. The next three sections spell out in
detail how to deliver on this mandate and propose a policy approach
along three dimensions: values, security, and markets. More precisely,
they lay out a path: 1. to promote a human rights-focused and
rules-based global technological order; 2. to secure the EU, its
partners, and other like-minded countries in the analogical and digital
worlds; 3. to promote fair, open, sustainable, and inclusive digital
markets.

[To **strengthen**]{.underline} inter-organisational [**cyber**

[develop **joint** **action** plans to be implemented by member states
and do away with]{.underline} technical issues such as [the lack of
**formal** **agreements** between **institutions**]{.underline}. The
work done at staff-to-staff level must now be replicated at the national
level by launching and investing in joint activities and projects that
will increase member states' capabilities. While top representatives
spoke of 'prioritising strengthened cooperation' at the 2016 and 2018
NATO summits, more should be done to generate investments from the
capitals. The following [**policy** **proposals** aim to **designate** a
number of **joint** **activities** with an aim to create more
**substantial** **cooperation** among the member states of both
organisations]{.underline}. A [**strong** **political** support and
**prioritisation** is **necessary** also from the **key**
**capitals**.]{.underline} First and foremost, an EU-NATO working group
on cyber security and defence issues must be established. These topics
must also be regular agenda items in other joint working and high
political level meetings, such as the EUNATO capability development
group and the NAC-PSC meetings. This new working group should discuss
policy themes where [closer cooperation can create **synergy**
(synchronising **crisis** **response** mechanisms, speeding
**political** **decision-making**, developing **joint** **response**
options to **cyberattacks**,]{.underline} etc). [Joint working groups at
the subject matter expert level should explore possibilities to
**develop** **joint** **research** and **innovation** **programmes** and
coordinate **national** and **union-level** **activities** in the area
of **emerging technologies**]{.underline} (including 5G and artificial
intelligence). Joint education and training courses should be created
with the first step of opening all existing courses to each other's
officials and member states. The [EU must be granted observer status at
the Steering Committee of NATO's]{.underline} Cooperative Cyber Defence
Centre of Excellence (**[CCD COE]{.underline}**), as suggested by the
Allied Command Transformation. [Formal cooperation -- including
technical arrangements for **information sharing** -- must also be
established with]{.underline} ENISA and other [relevant EU
bodies]{.underline} (such as the Cybersecurity Research and Competence
Centre and EU-CERT) in order [to facilitate participating in each
other's exercises]{.underline}. [Closer cooperation between **research
and competence** centres is needed to **jointly develop** doctrine and
concepts, and launch **common research** projects]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} areas such as [**cyber activities** in the grey space,
**supply chain security**, **military dependencies** on civilian
**critical infrastructure**]{.underline} (such as energy, transport and
finance), including how do develop common methodology to assess
inter-dependencies. The [NATO Cyber Defence Pledge could also be applied
to **non-NATO EU countries**]{.underline} and possibly in third
countries. The [resiliency requirements and cyber security standards of
the EU and NATO should be complementary]{.underline} and ensure the
minimum common level of protection in all countries. Information sharing
between the organisations has been improved but more should be done to
create joint threat assessments and intelligence sharing for attribution
of cyberattacks. The EU and NATO should continue synchronising their
hybrid threats playbooks with a view to creating joint responses. [They
must also synchronise cyber defence capabilities development **roadmaps
and experiences**]{.underline} on improving civilmilitary information
sharing. One way forward is through joint EU-NATO joint exercises, be
they technical, crisis management or table-top style. The table-top
exercises at the subject matter expert and ambassadors, foreign and
defence ministers level should explore the application of EU's cyber
diplomacy toolbox and joint response options. [More joint action is also
needed to promote the **application of international law**, confidence
building measures, and state responsible behaviour in
cyberspace]{.underline}. [Both organisations should create common cyber
capability **building programmes**, including **joint trust
funds**]{.underline}, for the third countries. In the area of cyber
defence, the EU and NATO should explore options on how to use the
sovereign effects of the NATO Cyberspace Operations Centre with a view
to support future EU missions and operations. PESCO's recent 'Cyber
Rapid Response Team' initiative -- comprised of nine participating EU
member states -- could be deployed to assist non-EU NATO countries and
third countries to prevent, detect and respond to cyber incidents.

**[International competition on technology]{.underline}**, such as 5G,
**[has recently attracted significant attention]{.underline}**. At the
2020 Munich Security Conference, for example, tech was an important
topic -- yet **[the discussion was not really about tech, but about
power, as the rivalry over who builds 5G telecommunications
infrastructure turned into a US-Chinese competition.]{.underline}** This
was despite the fact that the leading 5G providers are European and
Chinese.

There is a growing realisation that **[the adoption of AI-enabled

one actor considerable power over others, be it in the form of an
economic boost or an AI-enabled military advantage, or through control

global leadership between the US and China is intensifying, with
technology in general, and AI in particular, as battlefields. **[The US
fears that AI may give China a competitive edge.]{.underline}**
Therefore, **[countering China's AI ambitions -- as embodied in its
attempts to dominate international technology standards bodies, for
example -- has become an important motive for the US to seek
international cooperation.]{.underline}** In this context, Joe Biden has

**[In a world marked by COVID]{.underline}**-19, deeper **[social
divisions, more vulnerable supply chains, and increased competition in
the international arena, the roles of NATO and the EU]{.underline}** and
their ability to tackle global challenges **[are constantly being
questioned]{.underline}**. Moreover, with the proliferation of ad hoc
coalitions to tackle specific challenges, **[the two organizations are
constantly fighting for relevance and space to operate.]{.underline}**
In this context, as this paper has shown, **[both NATO and the EU have
more to gain through joining forces rather than competing with one
another]{.underline}**. In light of the arguments developed so far, some
broad policy recommendations appear relevant: 1. **[NATO and EU member
states should leverage their policy fora to discuss joint initiatives
and better employ their assets --- NATO's military capabilities and
logistical systems and the EU's capacity building and financial
assistance]{.underline}**. **[This would enable a more coordinated
approach to crises based on a division of labor agreed to on a
case-by-case basis.]{.underline}** Learning from past experiences, the
two organizations should work to avoid another "Afghanistan scenario" in
areas like the Sahel region. 2. **[NATO and the EU should increase
information sharing and establish protocols in crucial sectors from
anti-terrorism cooperation to cybersecurity]{.underline}**. The
**[periodic joint exercises]{.underline}** performed **[so far are
important steps toward building confidence and fostering regular updates
and the sharing of best practices]{.underline}**. **[Yet insufficient
information sharing and the lack of protocols in case of a crisis hinder
the utility of the exercises conducted]{.underline}**. While this
recommendation ultimately depends on political will, some **[smaller
channels could be created to streamline limited but vital information,
especially in the event of a cyberattack]{.underline}**. 3. Regarding
disinformation, **[NATO should take advantage of the EU's apparatus and
support it with its own solid structure for intelligence gathering ---
instead of having NATO's Public Diplomacy Division duplicate the work of
the EU StratCom task force]{.underline}**. Alternatively, because
countering disinformation is not the main job of the division, NATO
could create a separate disinformation unit to work closely with the
EU's task force. **[Coordinating efforts]{.underline}** **[to tackle
different outlets of disinformation could help reduce the overall
burden]{.underline}**. In both scenarios, the two organizations should
not just seek to counter disinformation but also prevent it as much as
possible. 4. **[NATO and the EU should increase their dialogue on
regulations and impediments to military mobility and
interoperability.]{.underline}** NATO's deeper expertise on strategic
airlifting and military operations could help the EU improve regulations
to facilitate military mobility. More broadly, NATO should leverage EU
regulatory power in conjunction with its objectives when it comes to
capacity building as well as in countering China's multifaceted
influence. 5. **[To reinforce NATO's posture in Europe and elsewhere,
the EU should boost its military capability]{.underline}** (as member
states' militaries contribute to NATO's single set of forces).
**[Enhanced military capabilities would also enable the EU to intervene
independently from the United States in theaters that are no longer
security priorities for Washington]{.underline}**. European countries
will need to assess their defense spending for greater efficiency and
assess the advantages of a more integrated procurement system. While
doing so, **[Europeans should consider mechanisms to enable the U.S.
defense industry to participate; this could minimize the economic
losses, foster technological development and cooperation on a
trans-Atlantic level, and reduce dependence on geopolitically risky
supplies]{.underline}**. 6. **[NATO and the EU should foster cooperation
in procurement and capability development to increase
interoperability]{.underline}**, **[including]{.underline}** through the
establishment of **[similar standards]{.underline}**. **[This would
enhance military mobility and interoperability across Europe and other

Improved military mobility and interoperability While an increased
European military posture is important per se, quick deployment and
interoperability across the trans-Atlantic space is equally important.
For this reason, **[NATO-EU cooperation appears even more relevant when
it comes to military mobility, interoperability and
procurement]{.underline}**. **[Military mobility]{.underline}** ---
defined as the ability to deploy and move thousands of troops across the
European territory **[--- is crucial to project an effective deterrence
and is a key area where NATO-EU cooperation has been the most
successful]{.underline}**. Many factors **[slow mobility]{.underline}**
and therefore **[negatively impact the readiness of European defense,
such as infrastructure incompatibility, as well as complex regulations
on the transportation of weapons or military equipment]{.underline}**.
In 2019, NATO countries identified concrete steps to increase their
military mobility, with the goal of being able to deploy 30 ground
battalions, 30 air squadrons, and 30 combatant ships in the span of 30
days.49 The steps focus on four main areas: (1) developing and
strengthening infrastructure, (2) improving strategic airlift and
sealift capabilities, (3) strengthening the command and control line as
well as planning for better coordination on a large scale, and (4)
easing legal and diplomatic procedures across the military and civilian
sectors to facilitate clearance processes. However, an Atlantic Council
report has noted some significant gaps within each of the above listed
sectors, which include a lack of resources and institutional weakness in
tackling military mobility. **[As military mobility has important
repercussions for strategic projection and procurement]{.underline}**,50
**[it should be an area where NATO and the EU could have a more
constructive dialogue]{.underline}**. Strategic location is not
currently a prime criterion for the evaluation of new defense projects
in the EU, as the union is not a military power and is not used to
strategic thinking in the military field. For this reason, the **[EU
could benefit from NATO geostrategic experience to identify areas where
more resources are needed and how they could be put to better use when
considering geographical factors]{.underline}**. For safer military
mobility, such infrastructure should also be made more resilient to
cyberattacks. Given its regulatory power, **[the European Union could
play a]{.underline}** **[valuable role]{.underline}** **[in easing
military mobility by establishing simpler processes]{.underline}** to
attain custom and border permissions for the transportation of, for
example, dangerous goods or military equipment. **[The EU is also well
placed to strengthen roads and infrastructure that are crucial for
military mobility]{.underline}**. In fact, the EU has launched the
Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) projects, a series of studies
and activities designed to eliminate bottlenecks to mobility across the
continent by, for example, completing missing sections of transit
corridors and developing new dual-use (civilian and military)
infrastructure projects.51 **[EU countries have also started featuring
military mobility in their defense projects under PESCO and have set
parameters for non-EU members to join; for example, Canada, Norway, and
the United States are expected to participate in a PESCO project led by
the Netherlands to test the state of military mobility in
Europe]{.underline}**.52 Improving military mobility across the
trans-Atlantic space would positively impact the interoperability of
allied armed forces --- specifically their ability to be deployed and to
operate with one another across the territory of the alliance. **[NATO
and the EU can already count on deep interoperability because they share
the forces of 21 countries that are member states of both
organizations]{.underline}**. **[Yet, as there are important asymmetries
in military capabilities]{.underline}** across the EU and more broadly
across the alliance space, **[interoperability is in constant need of
improvement]{.underline}**. So far, **[one]{.underline}** **[success
story of NATO-EU interoperability has been the technological cooperation
between the European Defense Agency (EDA) and the NATO Support and
Procurement Agency (NSPA) on air-to-air refueling
operations]{.underline}** (transferring fuel from one military aircraft
to another in mid-air). This cooperation **[helped address one of the
biggest EU defense shortfalls]{.underline}**.53 **[In the aftermath of
the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and the AUKUS deal]{.underline}**
that marks the United States' pivot toward the Indo-Pacific region,
**[the debate over European defense has sharpened and more funds are
being allocated to the European Defense Fund to strengthen the union's
military posture]{.underline}**. In fact, the **[third EU]{.underline}**
"Joint **[Report]{.underline}** to the European Parliament and the
Council **[on the Implementation of the Action Plan on Military
Mobility]{.underline}**" **[has noted significant progress since October
2020, including on custom formalities and work with the EDA on two
Cross-Border Movement Permission Technical
Arrangements]{.underline}**.54 Most importantly, from next year onward,
**[EU member states can use funding from the European Recovery and
Resilience Facility to invest in transport, including dual-use
infrastructure]{.underline}**.55 **[The EU also has a budget of 330
million euros (roughly \$375 million) for co-funding
projects]{.underline}** (subjects to call for proposals) on dual-use
infrastructure.56 While this level of ambition is certainly welcome
because of its positive impact on EU defense capabilities, **[the EDA
and NSPA should closely coordinate their efforts]{.underline}** in order
**[to increase interoperability and ultimately NATO and EU resilience
and readiness toward international security threats.]{.underline}**

**[[Building up defence]{.mark} capacity [must focus on]{.mark}
innovation, as new [tech]{.mark}nological developments, [such as
a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence]{.underline}**, hypersonic
weapons, quantum warfare **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** increasingly
complex **[[cyber]{.mark} threats, present a growing
challenge]{.underline}**, the summit was told.

**["Our competitors are shaping the environment, they are competing
every day, the threats are permanent, they are boundless, and they are
simultaneously used ... we have to manage that,"]{.underline}**
cautioned General Philippe Lavigne, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander
Transformation.

**["[We need more]{.mark} and more innovation [to adapt faster]{.mark},
to be agile [and]{.mark} we need innovation coming from our societies,
open innovation, in order [to]{.mark} continue to [get the
advantage]{.mark},"]{.underline}** he said in a pre-recorded interview
from Allied Command Transformation in Virginia.

The technology is moving fast and although NATO has what Lavigne called
"the best military thinking package in a generation", it still has to
accelerate change to keep ahead of its rivals amid an increasingly
complex tech landscape.

"The new plane will not be a new plane in the future. It will be a
system of systems, it will be sensors linked to platforms, linked to
space, linked to multi-domain. That's collaborative welfare," the
general explained.

However, there was a word of caution against over-reliance on technology
from Ian Bond, Director of Foreign Policy at the Centre for European
Reform in London.

"Russia's seizure of Crimea was low-tech; the Taliban's victory in
Afghanistan was no-tech," he wrote on the summit's chat line. "How does
NATO avoid reliance on vulnerable technology like GPS, satellite comms
and space-based sensors and how does it ensure that it can defeat
adversaries that don't rely on superior technology but on better
tactics?"

Speakers underscored the importance of working with the private sector
to ensure the latest technology is available to defend against offensive
threats from authoritarian regimes and rogue players.

"**[We have complex issues to solve and the world is volatile, and it is
in a state of disarray]{.underline}**," cautioned Jane Frankland,
award-winning leader, best-selling author, speaker and women's activist.

"**[[National, international and online threats are becoming
progressively integrated]{.mark} as our enemies develop new means to
exploit vulnerabilities across borders, and [between the cyber and
physical worlds]{.mark}]{.underline}**," she added, **[[naming China,
No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea [and Iran]{.mark} among the countries
developing more effective offensive cyber capabilities]{.underline}**.
"We have more threats, more costly breaches, and the speed and intensity
of these attacks continue to challenge every part of our ecosystem."

**[[Tech]{.mark}nology [presents a "great opportunity" for]{.mark}
further [EU-NATO coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}**, said Andrea G.
Rodríguez, Research Fellow at the Barcelona Centre for International
Affairs (CIDOB). **[She welcomed the Alliance's push to set
up]{.underline}** the Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North
Atlantic (**[DIANA]{.underline}**) by 2023 **[to provide a network of
technology test centres and accelerator sites to harness civilian
innovation for security. It could cooperate fruitfully with the EU's
proposed innovation hub]{.underline}** within the European Defence
Agency, Rodríguez said.

Innovation efforts should focus on quantum computing, AI, hypersonic and
some bio technologies, she added, "the technologies keeping me up at
night".

"**[[We are entering a time in which everything is
hyper-connected]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Rodríguez said. "With quantum
computing and quantum communications and other quantum applications that
may emerge, **[[it will be like going to war with horses]{.mark},
instead of like going to war with tanks, because the capacity lead will
be so big]{.underline}**," she cautioned. "**[[The first one who gets it
will have a strategic advantage]{.mark}. That's something that, as NATO
or as Europe, ... we shouldn't let happen]{.underline}**."

for deepening multilateral collaboration in strategically vital
industries.]{.underline}**

BERKELEY -- To be effective, economic sanctions depend on multilateral
coordination. Freezing the Russian central bank's holdings and kicking
Russian banks out of the SWIFT financial messaging system for
international payments in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine are
groundbreaking moves. But such measures will be successful only if there
are no (or at least very few) ways to circumvent them. Their
implementation and enforcement must be truly multilateral, extending
beyond NATO and the transatlantic community. The **[unprecedented
multilateral response to Russia's war is an opportunity for the United
States and its allies to strengthen their collaboration on a wide range
of shared security and economic issues.]{.underline}** **[Consider the
semiconductor industry]{.underline}**, which is **[crucial for today's
economy and for national security]{.underline}**. The sanctions limiting
Russian access to semiconductors depend on support from TSMC in Taiwan
and Samsung in South Korea, the leading global producers of both
commodity chips and the more advanced chips used in many weapons
systems.

**[Policy collaboration in the semiconductor sector]{.underline}** can
and **[should extend beyond the sanctions]{.underline}**. **[There are
many promising opportunities for collaboration among the economies that
form the core of today's complex semiconductor supply
chain]{.underline}**: the **[US]{.underline}**, the **[European
Union]{.underline}**, Japan, South Korea, **[Taiwan]{.underline}**,
Israel. All are investing significant public funds and deploying
industrial, research, training, trade, and cross-border investment
policies to increase their semiconductor producers' capabilities.
**[Multilateral policy coordination in the semiconductor industry should
aim to ensure a competitive, resilient, secure, and sustainable (CRSS)
supply of semiconductors to meet the significant increase in global
demand]{.underline}** over the next decade. Given the global dispersion
of research, production, talent, and knowledge, this **[goal cannot be
accomplished through technological autarky or isolationist
self-sufficiency.]{.underline}**

The **[concentration of chip production in Asia -- where China accounts

The **[solution is to invest significantly more in US and European

2.1 The **[Global Semiconductor Industry in a]{.underline}**
**[Geopolitical Storm]{.underline}** The US-China conflict is often
portrayed as a 'technological cold war'5 , where **[leadership in new
technologies is key to obtaining or retaining economic
supremacy]{.underline}**. **[The EU, while being at the forefront of
digital regulation]{.underline}**, all the while harnessing the
'Brussels effect'6 , **[relies on both the US and China]{.underline}**
for many **[digital goods and services]{.underline}**. **[This leaves
the EU caught in between the US-China rivalry]{.underline}**. The highly
specialised and globalised Informatics and Communication Technologies
(ICT) industry and its core technology -- semiconductors -- is an
interesting case study. **[Semiconductors]{.underline}** **[are one of
the most]{.underline}** **[strategically important]{.underline}**
**[sectors of the modern economy]{.underline}**. **[They have a wide
range of use -- from memory chips over sensors to processors -- and are
essential parts of the value chains in many industries.]{.underline}**
**[Semiconductors are embedded in all types of modern goods, from
manufacturing machinery, computers and smartphones, 5G transmitters,
medical equipment, cars to everyday household appliances]{.underline}**.
ICT goods are the most important Chinese export good. In 2019, they
account for over 27% of Chinese total exports and 96% of high-tech
exports from China to the US.7 **[Telecommunications equipment account
for over 30% of EU imports from China]{.underline}**. 8 However, for the
most crucial input to these ICT goods -- semiconductors -- China is
dependent on foreign inputs. As a result, semiconductors have become
China's single largest import, surpassing even oil (see Figure 1).
China's foreign dependency in its biggest industry has made
semiconductors a critical target for US trade policy and sanctions.
Semiconductors and related equipment account for a quarter of the US
exports subject to the Phase I trade agreement9 , and the technology is
used for targeted sanctions against Chinese companies10. Unsurprisingly,
the development of 'home-grown' semiconductors is an important goal of
Chinese industrial policy11. For such high-end products, know-how and
production capacities are highly specialised but they are also
integrated at the global level12. A few countries are home to
cutting-edge semiconductor production capacities: the US, Taiwan, South
Korea, Japan, Europe and increasingly, China. But to date, no country
has achieved self-sufficiency in the sector13. In fact, according to one
study14, **[the semiconductor value chain is made up of three steps
along which high coordination between firms is required: 1) design; 2)
fabrication; and 3) assembly]{.underline}** (see Figure 2). Some firms,
Integrated Design Manufacturers (IDM), do the first two steps and
represent about half of the overall semiconductor market. The below
analysis focuses on firms that only provide one production step15. The
design phase specifies the physical architecture of the semiconductor by
laying its functions and the electronic components that will be needed
for production. The US is by far the leader in design with firms such as
Qualcomm, Broadcom, Nvidia and AMD, but it is followed by Taiwan with
Mediatek, Novatek and Realtek. However, **[Chinese market shares are
increasing fast]{.underline}**16 **[and Chinese firms such as Unigroup
and Huawei subsidiary HiSilicon are important in this
regard]{.underline}**. Semiconductor designs rely on specific software
for which the market is highly concentrated around three US-based firms
-- Cadence, Synopsy, Mentor --, and it is on this part of the value
chain that US sanctions were most effective in blocking Huawei HiSilicon
productions.

CHART OMITTED

The second production step -- fabrication - is highly technical and the
most capital-intensive and \$ billions worth of upfront investments
would be needed to catch-up to market leaders.17 Fabrication is
concentrated around a few global players, with market leaders being
Taiwan's TSMC and Korea's Samsung. The third and last step -- assembly -
is comparatively labour intensive and reaps lower profit margins. Over
the years, this market has consolidated across countries and firms and
Taiwan is by far the leader in the sector with several top firms,
notably ASE Group, while the US has only one assembly firm, Amkor
Technologies. In this sector, China managed to increase significantly
its market share with firms such as JCET. Along these production steps,
machinery, inputs of raw materials such as silicon and chemicals are
required, corresponding to markets that are also very concentrated. The
US, EU and Japan are the biggest suppliers in those peripherical markets
and leading EU firms include Dutch ASMLA (machinery), German Aixtron
(chemicals) and French Riber (machinery)18. Overall, **[the high degree
of specialisation and concentration as well as the capital-intense
nature and high degree of cross-country interdependence of the
semiconductor sector expose its supply chain to political
risks]{.underline}**. **[Due to its strategic nature, it has been a
target for sanctions]{.underline}** by the US administration. The lack
of availability of substitutes makes export bans particularly effective
for impacting production lines. US export bans on American-made
technologies have put a dent in Huawei's production capacities19 and in
SMIC's (China's most promising foundry) ambitions to produce high-end
semiconductors20. Leverage over bottlenecks have been used by others
too, and Japan imposed export bans on crucial components to South Korea
in 201921. These **[sanctions have ripple effects through the entire
industry and on its customers]{.underline}**. **[Shortages caused by
increased demand for ICT goods during the pandemic have been aggravated
by stockpiling by Chinese firms in reaction to US sanctions, leading to
shortages in 2020]{.underline}**22. As a result, the car manufacturing
industry is reportedly facing challenges in upholding its production
lines, as technology companies are favoured in semiconductor
deliveries23. While the US uses its central position in these supply
chains to exert leverage over China, China is trying to catch-up and
become technologically independent. China's 'Made in China 2025' plan
includes the stated goal of a 70% semiconductor market share for Chinese
companies in 2025. However, when looking at the intermediate goal for
2020, it becomes clear how large the challenge is: while China aimed at
a 40% market share by 2020, it had only reached 19% share in 2019 in the
assembly, and it seems highly unlikely that it will gain the leadership
in all segments targeted by the State Council for 2030. The Chinese
state plans to invest \$118 billion in government funds over 5 years
into domestic production24. While this investment is considerable, it
seems insufficient to achieve technological leadership in this highly
specialised and competitive sector. The global investment into R&D by
the industry alone was \$68 billion in 202025, and capital investment is
considerably as well: TSMC announced capital spending of \$25 to \$28
billion for 202126. 2.2 **[Consequences for the EU and its Digital
Sovereignty]{.underline}** **[The semiconductor industry is
characterised by a high degree of interdependence between China, Taiwan,
South Korea, the US and the EU]{.underline}**. While the US is currently
leading in cutting-edge chip design and also fabrication, **[value
chains are highly integrated across]{.underline}** the
**[jurisdictions]{.underline}**. **[Recent US actions
have]{.underline}** indeed **[put these integrated value chains
into]{.underline}** **[distress]{.underline}**. China has responded by
investing into its own capacities but reportedly is still some years
away from being able to become self-sufficient. **[Although the EU is
making headway in defining what it means by 'open strategic
autonomy']{.underline}**27, **[in strategic sectors like the
semiconductor industry more tools and a clear vision are still
needed]{.underline}**. This is **[especially the case considering that
other global leaders]{.underline}** (**[US, Taiwan, Japan,
China]{.underline}**) **[have endorsed roadmaps and invested
massively]{.underline}** to support this strategic sector28.
**[On]{.underline}** the **[one hand, the EU is committed to keeping its
markets open to foreign competition and ensuring cheap
supplies]{.underline}** of valuable input into its productions processes
and consumer goods markets. **[Some may even argue that the 'tech war'
between the US and China offers an opportunity to free-ride on cheap
products, as both countries subsidise their tech sector]{.underline}**.
**[On the other hand, the EU is likely to be vulnerable to significant
pressure from both the US and China in the coming years when it comes to
the digital sector]{.underline}**. In our view, a central pillar in the
EU's strategy needs to be substantial investments in research and
production capacities in the sector. These investments need to be
protected from technology transfers through a strong investment
screening mechanism. The **[recent case of the US pressuring the Dutch
government to cancel the sale of semiconductor machinery to
China]{.underline}**29, whether for economic or security purposes,
**[begs questions of what the EU strategy is]{.underline}**. At the same
time, the highly specialised nature of this key sector exemplifies the
benefits of global value chains. A strategy to reach full independence
from foreign inputs in the sector seems not only extremely costly, but
also unfeasible for Europe, China and even the US, at least in the
coming years. In our view, **[European industrial policy should create
more domestic production capacities without aiming at import
substitution]{.underline}**. Rather than import substitution,
diversification of supplies, both with new domestic supplies as well as
additional foreign supplies, would reduce vulnerabilities. Moreover,
**[a greater weight of EU-based production capacities in global supply
chains can give the EU leverage.]{.underline}** **[A threat by a trading
partner to interrupt supplies could then be counteracted with threats to
equally disrupt supplies. Crucially, this leverage should be used to
improve the resilience of this industry through plurilateral cooperation
and by strengthening multilateral trade institutions]{.underline}**. In
practice, **[the real question is whether the EU could have the
instruments and the political capacity to retaliate with such
threats]{.underline}**. **[Strategic sovereignty]{.underline}**
**[implies an ability to jointly take stock of economic and security
interests]{.underline}**. The EU manages separately sectoral policies
and this **[fragmentation of tasks between member states and the EU is a
weakness in today's world of increased geopolitical
tensions]{.underline}**. Medium term, **[the EU needs to consider
changing its decision-making processes in foreign policy related
matters]{.underline}**. The European Commission President's idea to
reconsider the unanimity requirement in foreign policy is worthwhile,
though with major implications beyond the scope of this chapter.

The **[E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion **[wants to build
its own microchip manufacturing capability to counterbalance the
dominant Asian market and ensure enduring technological
sovereignty.]{.underline}** Industry officials have separately called
for a pan-European electronics strategy, but until a recent EU proposal
becomes concrete legislation, **[the long-term effects on military
programs may prove difficult to gauge.]{.underline}** EU leaders
recently announced the European Chips Act meant to support increased
research, design and testing capacity as well as ensure national
investments are coordinated with those of the broader union. "The aim is
to jointly create a state-of-the-art European chip ecosystem, including
production, that ensures our security of supply and will develop new
markets for ground-breaking European tech," said European Commission
President Ursula von der Leyen during her Sept. 15 state of the union
address in Strasbourg, France. The ultimate goal is to increase Europe's
global share of semiconductor production to 20 percent by 2030, per the
commission. **[Digital technology is the "make-or-break issue" facing
the European market today]{.underline}**, and "there is no digital
without chips," she said. While the global demand for semiconductors has
exploded, the European share of designing and manufacturing those
microchips has diminished, and nations have largely become reliant on
Asian-made products, she noted. The COVID-19 pandemic sparked a global
microchip shortage that prompted other governments, including the United
States, to introduce a domestic semiconductor strategy, as the chips
enable systems in virtually every sector from the military to health
care and from computers to clean energy. Nations are developing
interconnected, highly software-enabled platforms to operate in
increasingly joint environments, and "digitalization" has become a
buzzword across the global defense sphere. In Europe, those platforms
include the Franco-German-Spanish Future Combat Air System program that
would ultimately feature a next-generation fighter, unmanned drones, and
a slew of sophisticated sensors and weaponry, all interconnected with
each other. Meanwhile, **[NATO has highlighted "emerging and disruptive
technologies" as a key focus area for the alliance.]{.underline}** Many
of the technologies it cited will rely on digitalization. The United
Kingdom, Sweden and Italy are also co-researching and developing
cutting-edge technologies to enable sixth-generation air combat
platforms under their own initiative, dubbed Tempest by the British.
Industry and government officials involved in that effort were asked
about domestic electronics sourcing during a panel discussion at the
biennial DSEI conference in London last month, which took place the same
day as von der Leyen's speech. A conference attendee asked **[whether
the British-led effort would rely on European-sourced and -manufactured
parts, rather than Chinese or American electronics]{.underline}**.
Richard Berthon, **[director of future combat air]{.underline}** for the
British Defence Ministry, **[said his team will access the global market
for parts "where it's cost-effective, \[and\] where our sovereignty and
security are not impaired]{.underline}**." Berthon emphasized that the
program office is taking security "incredibly seriously," and that the
entire Tempest enterprise "is all about ensuring that for the U.K.,
we've got the technology we need, the skills we need, that we can secure
those, and we can sustain them over time." Another panelist, Saab Deputy
chief executive Anders Carp, called for a "pan-European or pan-Western
strategy" to help governments and their industry partners prioritize key
technology research and development efforts. Saab represents Swedish
industry participation in the British-led aircraft push. **[The
electronics sourcing conversation is broader than just one such
technology initiative]{.underline}** --- or the fighter aircraft
portfolio --- **[and could encompass some other mix of trusted allies
and partners,]{.underline}** Carp noted. However it's organized,
"**[there should be some sort of strategy in place to look at how do we
make sure that we don't end up being reliant on someone]{.underline}**
\... that we don't want to be reliant on, or may not want to be reliant
on in the future," he said in an interview with Defense News. When it
comes to the broader Tempest effort, industry partners are discussing
these issues "at a headline level," as the program's design phase
remains in the study stages, Carp noted. Multiple European industry
representatives declined to comment on the European Chips Act, citing
the recent nature of the initiative. The EU has yet to announce when the
European Chips Act might be formally unveiled or voted on. Thierry
Breton, the European commissioner for internal markets, laid out
proposed elements of the effort in a Sept. 15 LinkedIn post, including
building European-based fabrication plants and establishing a European
semiconductor fund. With 27 EU members, there will be divergent opinions
involved in developing the legislation and "a lot of different interests
on the ground level," said Dan Darling, a senior analyst for Forecast
International, a U.S. market intelligence firm. The focus on domestic
semiconductor sovereignty makes sense, **[but the EU needs to move from
"a declaration of vision and intent" to actual momentum]{.underline}**,
he said. Europe is home to a plethora of defense electronics companies,
and **[a domestic supply of resources is sure to trickle up
eventually]{.underline}**, he added. That being said, European defense
contractors have established business relationships with overseas chip
suppliers --- such as Samsung in South Korea and the Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company --- not the existing suppliers on
their own continent, said Franz-Stefan Gady, a cyber, space and future
conflict fellow at the London-based think tank International Institute
for Strategic Studies. "**[At the moment, European advanced
semiconductor manufacturers produce low-volume niche
products]{.underline}** with limited military applicability," he told
Defense News. Some such niche products could make headway in Europe,
like those related to aerospace sensors, or security chips for crypto
processing and other cybersecurity technologies. **[But]{.underline}**
it's unlikely European chipmakers would supply individual European
nations' defense industries over the next two decades, as the expense
would be too great even with strong political will behind the effort,
Gady added. "**[There is no real market and very little genuine demand
from the European defense industry for indigenous European products en
masse]{.underline}**, **[despite paying lip service to the concept of
strategic autonomy]{.underline}**," he said. Von der Leyen, who
previously served as Germany's defense minister, acknowledged in her
speech that boosting sovereign semiconductor manufacturing capabilities
will be a "daunting task," but one required at this point in time to
support both European competitiveness and technological sovereignty.
"Let's put all of our focus on it," she said.

### Block -- Impact -- Supply Shocks 

#### Taiwan's a supply [choke-point]{.underline}\-\--it's vulnerable [now]{.underline}, and shocks [ripple globally]{.underline}.

Dependent on Taiwan for Semiconductors]{.underline}**", Bloomberg News,

As China pushes the world to avoid official dealings with Taiwan,
**[leaders across the globe are]{.underline}** realizing just how
**[dependent]{.underline}** they've become on the island democracy.
**[Taiwan]{.underline}**, which China regards as a province, is being
**[courted for its capacity to make leading-edge computer
chips]{.underline}**. That's mostly down to Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co., the world's largest foundry and go-to producer of
chips for Apple Inc. smartphones, artificial intelligence and
high-performance computing. Taiwan's role in the world economy largely
existed below the radar, until it came to recent prominence as the auto
industry suffered shortfalls in chips used for everything from parking
sensors to reducing emissions. With carmakers including Germany's
Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co. of the U.S. and Japan's Toyota Motor Corp.
forced to halt production and idle plants, **[Taiwan's importance
has]{.underline}** suddenly **[become too big to ignore]{.underline}**.

U.S., European and Japanese automakers are lobbying their governments
for help, with Taiwan and TSMC being asked to step in. Chancellor Angela
Merkel and President Emmanuel Macron discussed the potential for
shortages last year and agreed on the need to accelerate Europe's push
to develop its own chip industry, according to a French official with
knowledge of the matter. The auto industry's pleas illustrate how
**[TSMC's chip-making skills have handed Taiwan]{.underline}**
**[political]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[economic
leverage]{.underline}** **[in a world where technology is being enlisted
in the great power rivalry]{.underline}** **[between the U.S. and
China]{.underline}** \-- a standoff unlikely to ease under the
administration of Joe Biden.

**[Taiwan's grip on the semiconductor business \--]{.underline}**
despite **[being under]{.underline}** **[constant threat]{.underline}**
**[of invasion by Beijing \--]{.underline}** also **[represents
a]{.underline}** **[choke point]{.underline}** **[in the global supply
chain that's giving]{.underline}** **[new urgency]{.underline}** to
plans from Tokyo to Washington and Beijing to increase self-reliance.
**[By]{.underline}** **[dominating]{.underline}** the **[U.S.-developed
model of outsourcing chip manufacture, Taiwan]{.underline}**
"**[is]{.underline}** potentially **[the most]{.underline}**
**[critical]{.underline}** **[single]{.underline}** **[point of
failure]{.underline}** **[in the entire semiconductor value
chain]{.underline}**," said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, director of the
technology and geopolitics project at Berlin-based think tank Stiftung
Neue Verantwortung.

The Trump administration exploited that pinch point to deny Beijing
access to technology. By banning access to all U.S. chip technology
including design, it was able to cut off the supply of semiconductors
from TSMC and other foundries to Huawei Technologies, hobbling the
advance of China's biggest tech company. It also negotiated with TSMC to
establish a \$12 billion chip fabrication plant in Arizona. South
Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. is set to follow, with a \$10 billion
facility in Austin, Texas. The "CHIPS for America Act" introduced to
Congress last year aims to encourage more plants to be established in
the U.S. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, plans to reintroduce the
bipartisan bill this year with a view to securing \$25 billion in
federal funds and tax incentives. McCaul said in a statement he's
working with colleagues in the House and Senate "to prioritize getting
the remaining provisions of CHIPS signed into law as quickly as
possible." News that Intel Corp., the onetime industry leader, was
considering outsourcing production of some chips to TSMC under its
former CEO underscored the need for a U.S. player that can fabricate at
the leading edge, said a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee staff
who is not authorized to speak publicly. The European Union aims to
bolster the bloc's "technological sovereignty" through an alliance armed
initially with as much as 30 billion euros (\$36 billion) of
public-private investment to raise Europe's share of the global chip
market to 20% (without a target date) from less than 10% now. It's also
encouraging Taiwan to increase investments in the 27-nation bloc, with
some success. GlobalWafers Co. \-- based in TSMC's hometown of Hsinchu
\-- just boosted its offer for Germany's Siltronic AG to value the
company at 4.4 billion euros, an acquisition that would create the
world's largest silicon wafer maker by revenue.

That's not to say Taiwan is the only player in the semiconductor supply
chain. The U.S. still holds dominant positions, notably in chip design
and electronic software tools; ASML Holding NV of the Netherlands has a
monopoly on the machines needed to fabricate the best chips; Japan is a
key supplier of equipment, chemicals and wafers. But **[as the emphasis
shifts to ever smaller, more powerful chips that require less energy,
TSMC is increasingly in a field of its own]{.underline}**. And **[it's
helped Taiwan form a comprehensive ecosystem around it: ASE Technology
Holding is the world's top chip assembler, while MediaTek has become the
largest smartphone chipset vendor.]{.underline}**

Tokyo, too, is attempting to attract TSMC to set up in Japan. With 110
billion yen (\$1 billion) earmarked last year for R&D investment and
another 90 billion yen for 2021, some of that may go to a TSMC facility,
which reports have said the company is considering setting up in Japan.
"**[TSMC is becoming more and more dominant]{.underline}**," said Kazumi
Nishikawa, an official working on technology issues at Japan's Economy
Ministry. "This is **[something everybody in the chip industry must find
a way to deal with]{.underline}**." China, in its five-year plan
presented in October, is channeling help to the chip industry and other
key technologies to the tune of \$1.4 trillion through 2025. Yet even
that kind of money doesn't negate the need for Taiwan. Indeed, China has
long tapped the island for chip-making talent; two key executives at
China's top chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.,
used to work at TSMC: co-Chief Executive Officer Liang Mong Song and
Vice Chairman Chiang Shang-yi.

But **[with Washington stymieing China's progress]{.underline}**, there
is also speculation that **[Beijing could resort to]{.underline}**
**[stealing chip IP]{.underline}**, **[with Taiwan at the heart of those
endeavors]{.underline}**. **[Taiwanese cyber security firm TeamT5 has
observed a steady increase in attacks on the island's chip industry
corresponding to the tightening of U.S. export controls on
China]{.underline}**. While it's not always possible to know if these
are Chinese state actors, "they are **[all attacking the Taiwanese
semiconductor industry]{.underline}**," Shui Lee, a T5 cyber threat
analyst, said. Fellow analyst Linda Kuo said the **[Taiwanese government
was alarmed by a ransomware attack on TSMC in 2018]{.underline}** and
had announced plans for some \$500 million to help the industry become
more aware of cyber security issues.

The greater worry is that **[TSMC's chip factories could
become]{.underline}** **[collateral damage]{.underline}** **[if China
were to]{.underline}** make good on threats to **[invade
Taiwan]{.underline}** if it moves toward independence. TSMC\'s capital
spending of as much as \$28 billion for this year suggests it\'s going
to stay out in front. "**[Taiwan is the]{.underline}** **[center of
gravity]{.underline}** **[of Chinese security]{.underline}** policy,"
said Mathieu Duchatel, director of the Asia program at the Institut
Montaigne in Paris. Yet while Taiwan's status in the global chip supply
chain is a "huge strategic value," it's also a powerful reason for
Beijing to stay away, said Duchatel, who's just published a policy paper
on China's push for semiconductors. Assuming Taiwanese forces were to be
overwhelmed during an invasion, "**[there is no reason why they would
leave these facilities intact]{.underline}**," he said. And
**[preserving the world's most advanced fabs]{.underline}** "**[is in
the interests of everyone]{.underline}**."

\[Edited\] for ableist language

That is the good news. But **[the war also holds a cautionary tale for
the West: the peril of relying on supply chains that can be choked or
cut by an adversary]{.underline}**. Since the war's outbreak, the
**[United States and]{.underline}** our **[allies have inflicted severe
financial and industrial sanctions on Russia. Yet the effect of these
sanctions has been blunted]{.underline}** somewhat **[by Europe's
dependence on Russian energy exports, especially natural
gas.]{.underline}** While Russia has been cut off from other revenue
sources, European money for oil and gas still flows into the Kremlin.
Paradoxically, **[even as EU members send billions in military aid to
Ukraine, they continue to pay Russia more than \$20 billion per month
for fossil fuels]{.underline}**. The hard truth is that **[supply chains
dependent on massive, capital-intensive facilities can't be rerouted
quickly when the guns begin to roar]{.underline}**. Countries can rush
to cobble together alternative supplies --- witness Germany's scramble
to build liquefied natural gas terminals and ink a supply deal with
Qatar. But the **[immense fixed costs mean that leading European
economies such as Germany and Italy are largely at the mercy of existing
dispositions]{.underline}**. European leaders now regret that the
continent made itself so reliant on Russian oil and gas.

For the **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, our **[most
critical supply chain vulnerability is not in energy; it is in
semiconductors]{.underline}**. We are still among the world's leaders in
chip design, but **[America manufactures only about 12 percent of global
chip output --- a share that has declined steadily for three
decades]{.underline}**. Meanwhile, **[the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[is the world's second-largest importer of
chips, and we import almost three times as many semiconductors as we
export]{.underline}**. **[Almost all of those come from
Asia.]{.underline}** Considering that virtually all our electronics,
including the device on which you are probably reading this article,
rely on chips, it is no stretch to say that our daily lives --- indeed,
our national livelihood --- depend on semiconductors. Fortunately,
democratic **[Taiwan]{.underline}**, not communist China, at the moment
**[retains an overwhelming lead in this]{.underline}** most **[critical
commodity]{.underline}** for the information economy. Yet Taiwan is
**[the most likely target of aggression by Beijing]{.underline}**. The
U.S. Indo-Pacific Command has warned of the risk that China will attempt
an invasion within five years. **[In an invasion or blockade, Taiwan's
more than 50 percent share of global advanced chip output would
disappear immediately from the world market]{.underline}**. If anything,
that **[calamity]{.underline}** actually **[understates]{.underline}**
**[the problem: Critical sea lanes around Taiwan also would be
disrupted, because insurers would not cover ships passing near a war
zone. This would prevent chips made in manufacturing hubs such as South
Korea, Vietnam and Japan from reaching markets.]{.underline}**

The **[resulting shortfalls would \[rupture\]]{.underline}** ~~cripple~~
the **[supply chains that power global manufacturing]{.underline}**,
**[devastating the]{.underline}** American **[economy]{.underline}**.
U.S. **[manufacturers, still trying to catch up from COVID-related
disruptions, would struggle to produce airplanes, automobiles, home
appliances, personal electronics, communications devices and countless
other products and systems.]{.underline}** Once these
**[shortfalls]{.underline}** arise, they **[are hard to make up ---
chip-making plants, or "fabs," cost billions of dollars and take years
to build.]{.underline}** A **[chip-supply crisis would put American
national defense at grave risk. Advanced precision munitions would be
decisive in a war with China]{.underline}**. Magazine depth --- each
country's **[stockpile of precision munitions and ability to build
more]{.underline}** --- **[would help decide which side would
prevail]{.underline}**, or at least outlast the other. American
**[reliance on chip supplies from Asia would make it hard for American
manufacturers to keep pace]{.underline}**. In the 21st century, if we
are to remain the Arsenal of Democracy, we must be able to make chips

"Some people felt like it would be mostly to talk about disputes with
the Europeans over how to regulate the tech sector," Padilla said. But
**[after Russia invaded Ukraine]{.underline}**, "**[people on both sides
of the Atlantic got reminded that the U.S.-European relationship is the
essential partnership --- economically, politically and now
militarily]{.underline}** --- in the world." Those officials clearly
felt **[a shared sense of urgency to onshore semiconductor
manufacturing]{.underline}**. At the TTC, they agreed to collaborate
more closely on supply chain transparency and subsidy programs. The
strong language contained in those clauses affirmed their commitment to
an already aggressive onshoring strategy. The meeting also **[revealed
the centrality of semiconductor manufacturing to U.S.-centric military
objectives]{.underline}**. For chip manufacturers, that means
free-flowing subsidies for now, but at the cost of a potential
overcapacity problem in the longer term.

Technological developments naturally focus our attention on change. But,
in this whirl of dynamism, many less stirring, but no less critical,
pockets of continuity often go unnoticed. **[Technology can engender
rapid changes]{.underline}**, but, **[as]{.underline}** many of the
contributors emphasise, several aspects of the **[struggle for digital
sovereignty]{.underline}** have already been with us for several years
and we can expect that they will **[continue]{.underline}** to shape
that struggle for many years to come. The first concerns the
**[continuation of the bipolar competition between the United States and
China]{.underline}** that **[is undermining international cooperation,
particularly on technology issues]{.underline}**. Nearly all the essays
underline that this conflict will likely persist, and indeed that
**[US-Chinese relations, particularly on technology issues, will
continue to deteriorate]{.underline}**. As both Fran Burwell and Janka
Oertel show, the **[pandemic has exacerbated existing divisions between
the US and China]{.underline}**. Most of the authors
**[see]{.underline}** their burgeoning **[conflict as framing the
European struggle for digital sovereignty. Europe remains digitally
dependent on both the US and China in a variety of
domains]{.underline}**, from chat platforms to telecommunications
equipment. **[Competition between the US and China means that both sides
increasingly see the European market as a critical battleground in the
larger struggle to establish their global technological and industrial
dominance]{.underline}**. **[Europe]{.underline}**, in Oertel's words,
**[is]{.underline}** already "**[caught in the
crossfire]{.underline}**". As recent political debates within Europe on
issues as diverse as 5G technology and internet regulation demonstrate,
US-Chinese rivalry is starting to impinge on practically every
technological issue.

The **[second area of continuity concerns the capacity of digital
tools]{.underline}**, particularly social media, **[to spread
disinformation and undermine democratic institutions]{.underline}**. As
José Ignacio Torreblanca points outs, the coronavirus crisis has only
highlighted the degree to which both **[foreign and domestic actors can
use a combination of digital technology and social psychology to pursue
a variety of political agendas, including disrupting democratic
processes and exacerbating domestic political
polarisation]{.underline}**. The growing awareness of this problem has
not yet lessened its prevalence and we should expect conflict within
societies over how to regulate digital content. **[The fact
that]{.underline}**, **[in Europe]{.underline}**, **[the dominant social
media companies are American means that the struggle to regulate them
will have geopolitical consequences]{.underline}**.

A **[final field of continuity concerns the persisting digital divide
within Europe]{.underline}**. As Alicia Richart emphasises, this divide
does not correlate with the size or power of the state. Some of the
largest and wealthiest states in Europe, such as Germany and France, lag
in creating digital infrastructure, while Lithuania and Greece are among
the leaders. The more critical divide is also within states: between
urban areas that tend to have effective access to digital infrastructure
and rural areas. Digital divides have all sorts of pernicious effects on
individual lives and national solidarity. But the
**[coronavirus]{.underline}** also highlights just **[how critical
digital technology and infrastructure has become in enabling countries
to retain their capacity to act]{.underline}**, particularly **[in
crises]{.underline}**. Spain's strong digital infrastructure, as Richart
points out, was essential to its capacity to manage the lockdown and its
overall covid-19 response. **[Digital divides]{.underline}** thus also
**[threaten both European sovereignty and European resilience when the
next crisis, regardless of its nature, hits]{.underline}**.

//CHC-DS 🐱‍👤

Though **[global demand for chips will undoubtedly increase in the
coming years, the current shortages have prompted governments and firms
to invest in fabrication, making overcapacity in the future not
unlikely]{.underline}**. For instance, **[prices for some types of
memory chip, which best fit the definition of a commodity, are expected
to decline by 16% in 2022 as supply growth outstrips
demand]{.underline}**. The **[chips industry is subject to
boom-and-bursts cycles]{.underline}**. **[The Commission has not
clarified which market failure the Chips Act is supposed to address with
massive government support, or how obtaining an (at best) modest market
share in cutting-edge logic chips would actually increase EU
geostrategic leverage]{.underline}**. **[On supply management,
implementing emergency measures would not fit the reality of supply and
demand dynamics in the high-end chips sector]{.underline}**. The
**[chips that would be produced by an EU 'first-of-a-kind' facility are
not commodities that can be reallocated. High-end logic chips are
produced by foundries according to customer specifications, which vary
between industries and buyers, and the manufacturing of such chips can
take up to 26 weeks]{.underline}**. **[A request to divert production
would be inconsistent with an industry that cannot swiftly adapt
production lines -- as confirmed by the 2021 shortages.]{.underline}**

Governments currently make up 1% of global demand for chips. If the
Commission were to act as a buyer, it would have to choose to which
companies to allocate the scarce supplies, while making the situation
worse for everyone else. This problem can be much better solved by firms
reviewing the trade-off between lean inventories and supply
sustainability. The private sector should adapt to the risks on global
value chains witnessed during the pandemic -- it is starting to do so.
Such **[measures raise risks of adverse economic implications and
political messaging. Protectionist measures in a sector in which the EU
is currently dependent on imports could create a precedent which would
be to the detriment of the EU if copied by other players.]{.underline}**
Chip shortages were not the result of export bans but of a multitude of
economic factors. **[Where export control measures have been introduced
in the chips sector, it has been because of geopolitical rivalries and
has not targeted the EU]{.underline}**. While the rationale for EU
export controls -- economic activity or national security -- remains
unclear, their signalling is clearly protectionist. The EU has more to
lose than others from 'beggar-thy-neighbour' policies in the industry.

**[The need for a more muscular trade policy would be better achieved
through general trade defence tools than chip-specific export
controls]{.underline}**. The **[EU should push back
against]{.underline}** **[uncoordinated]{.underline}** **[protectionist
reactions triggered by heightened supply chain risks and
uncertainty]{.underline}**, **[since]{.underline}** the
**[COVID]{.underline}**-19 crisis **[and Russia's aggression against
Ukraine]{.underline}**. **[This moment should be turned into
an]{.underline}** **[opportunity]{.underline}** **[for sustainable
trade: the balancing act is between creating global coordination
structures among likeminded partners for strategically important
products, while retaining policy independence from players such as the

EU to embrace power.40 While increasingly salient, strategic autonomy
has also been controversial. **[Detractors dismiss it as a misleading
notion that creates the illusion of an EU capable of achieving
independence from the US, which remains the ultimate security guarantor
of several (most) EU member states]{.underline}**.41 While
understandable, such **[concerns are misplaced]{.underline}**.
**[Autonomy is not about independence. It is about reducing the
vulnerability of the EU and its member states to the political use of
asymmetric interdependencies by other countries, starting with systemic
rivals but including also allies. Examples include Russia's leveraging
its energy supplies, China using access to its market to force
technology transfers, and the US weaponising financial interdependencies
through extraterritorial sanctions.]{.underline}**42 It is not by chance
that autonomy has become increasingly tied to the notion of 'European
sovereignty'.43 This **[connection does not stem from a (non-existent)
demand to confer statehood on the EU, but points to the strengthening of
the Union as the best way to enable EU member states to act according to
their own norms and laws]{.underline}**. In these terms, **[greater
autonomy of the EU is tantamount to a stronger defence of the sovereign
rights of its member states]{.underline}**. Partly, the **[demand for
stronger autonomy results from the evolution of the EU into an ever more
integrated polity, endowed with more competencies and correspondingly
greater ambitions]{.underline}**. Arguably **[more
important]{.underline}**, however, **[has been the emerging
multipolarity of international politics]{.underline}**. The latter is
usually **[ascribed to the growing economic prowess of such countries as
China, which seek to promote their own models of governance of global
issues]{.underline}**. Yet, an equally decisive factor has been the
difficulty of US policymakers to forge an enduring consensus on how the
US should conduct itself in international affairs. The **[ever-wilder
oscillations of America's foreign policy have emboldened its rivals and
disoriented its allies. Critically, US foreign policy swings have
eventually resulted in a diminished commitment to the system of
multilateral institutions, treaties and regimes that the US itself did
the most to create]{.underline}** in the decades after World War II.44
This trend peaked during the Trump years, when the US deliberately
pursued a policy of contestation (of the World Trade Organisation and
the International Criminal Court, to mention just a few) and
disengagement (a partial list of international arrangements the US left
under Trump include the Paris Accord on climate, the World Health
Organisation, the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces and Open Skies
treaties, as well as the Iran nuclear deal). **[As the US distanced
itself from multilateral institutions, China made efforts to increase
its sway within them, targeting in particular technical agencies such as
the International Standards Organisation and the International
Telecommunication Union to bring global technology standards closer to
Chinese ones]{.underline}**.45 **[Seen from the EU]{.underline}**,
**[this is a vicious cycle in which multilateral institutions are
simultaneously undermined from without (by the US) and within (by
China)]{.underline}**. **[The outcome may be a dysfunctional
multilateral order]{.underline}** or one **[that more closely reflects
China's model of authoritarian capitalism]{.underline}**. 46 Either
outcome would negatively affect the EU and its member states' security
and prosperity, as it would reduce European influence in existing
multilateral institutions. The strengthening and expansion of the latter
are therefore essential in making the EU and its member states capable
of navigating the agitated waters of a more competitive international
system. **[The ability of EU member states to live by their own laws and
rules is thus inextricably linked to multilateralism.]{.underline}**

Specifically, **[multilateralism performs three functions that serve
European sovereignty]{.underline}**. The **[first]{.underline}** **[is
that it anchors interstate interactions in accepted, and at times
binding, norms, rules and practices]{.underline}**. **[The EU and its
member states have an interest in ensuring that such norms, rules and
practices continue to reflect values they share, including individual
rights, democracy, secularism, non-discriminatory trade and free
markets]{.underline}**. **[Second]{.underline}**, **[multilateralism is
about cooperatively addressing transnational challenges, like climate
change, pandemics or the myriad risks emanating from regional crises,
which affect European citizens, economy and security]{.underline}**.
**[Third]{.underline}**, **[multilateralism reduces the room for power
politics to shape international affairs, an outcome that favours a
collective polity with very limited military projection capacity such as
the EU]{.underline}**. 47 Admittedly, **[strengthening multilateral

the **[Union managed to bring forward the multilateral agendas on
international justice (ICC) and climate (Kyoto Protocol) in the face of

promote multilateralism is the pursuit of the nuclear agreement with
Iran and the defence of it after the US pull-out]{.underline}**. The
purpose of this chapter is to analyse the Joint Comprehensive Plan of
Action (JCPOA) between Iran and a group of six powers, namely the US,
China, Russia and the E3 of France, Germany and the UK, as well as the
HR/VP in representation of the EU (together labelled the E3/EU+3).48 The
case of the 'Iran Nuclear Deal' can help us ascertain what contribution
it has made to multilateralism, and what role the EU played in bringing
about its agreement. In particular, the case of the JCPOA is
illustrative of the way in which **[the EU requires multilateral
frameworks and partnerships in order to wield influence in international
relations]{.underline}**. Lessons from the Iran Nuclear Deal can be used
more broadly **[for the way the EU can play a more effective role in
global affairs]{.underline}**.

Of course, it makes sense for countries to ally themselves with the
world's foremost power, and only for that reason NATO will continue to
exist for some time to come. But increasingly, **[the de facto
EU-US-NATO triangle is becoming untenable]{.underline}**. On the one
hand, **[sustaining US-led NATO as Europe's primary security forum at
the end of the day runs counter to EU ambitions in the field of foreign
and security policy]{.underline}**. On the other hand **[it ties Europe
to a more global US security agenda that, deep down, it does not
subscribe to and that it is certainly not willing to shoulder
financially]{.underline}**. Finally, **[as long as Europe remains a
function of US security policy, this will put a curb on its ability to
forge comprehensive partnerships with third parties.]{.underline}**
Revamping the Transatlantic Relationship The transatlantic relationship,
North America's partnership with Europe, is still the world's most vital
economic, strategic and political bond, and will remain so for the
foreseeable future. **[The question is]{.underline}**, however,
**[whether NATO should remain its ultimate embodiment, or whether this
relationship should be remodelled]{.underline}** and based **[on a broad
and new strategic EU-US partnership, including provisions on security
and defence]{.underline}** such as a mutual assistance clause. Such **[a
recalibrated partnership would leave room for differences]{.underline}**
in approach **[and]{.underline}** be more informal in nature, while not
necessarily always involving all 27 EU members, but still important when
crises erupt. **[We have seen examples of]{.underline}** this kind of
**[cooperation on Iran]{.underline}**, with the EU3 teaming up with the
US, and the Middle East, **[where the EU sits next to the
US]{.underline}**A, **[the UN and Russia in the Quartet]{.underline}**:
both cases that do not allow for direct NATO involvement. Good Old NATO
**[Critics will maintain that we cannot do without NATO's unique
capabilities]{.underline}**, in terms of joint planning and
interoperability. No other organization but NATO can conduct an
operation like ISAF, the argument runs. But in many respects ISAF is a
revealing operation. What we really see in Afghanistan is an able and
willing coalition that runs the demanding southern and eastern regional
commands, and a host of other countries doing something else in the more
benign provinces. Out of ISAF's 46 contributors, **[non-NATO member
Australia seamlessly joins combat operations]{.underline}** in the
South, while NATO member Germany is carrying out its national
stabilization operation in the north, steered by the Bundestag rather
than by NATO. None of these countries would be able to sustain their
operations without US enablers**[. So it is]{.underline}** rather the
US, and **[not]{.underline}** necessarily **[NATO, which is
pivotal]{.underline}** within ISAF. **[Trading NATO for the EU-USA does
not mean doing away with the acquis atlantique, but it would mean doing
away with a top-heavy alliance that]{.underline}** served its purpose
well but increasingly **[stirs unease in Europe]{.underline}**, while
becoming less relevant to Washington -- even if the newest US National
Security Strategy routinely speaks of NATO as the pre-eminent security
alliance in the world today. **[NATO, or Europe, is nowhere as central
in US security thinking as many Europeans like to
believe]{.underline}**. When 9/11 occurred, invoking the alliance's
Article 5 only came as an afterthought. Paradoxically, this trend may be
reinforced under a less traditionally inclined president Obama, no
matter how enthusiastically his inauguration was celebrated in Europe.
Moreover, **[building a new relationship with the US]{.underline}**A
**[which is more balanced]{.underline}** than it is now **[would likely
stimulate Europe to further boost its]{.underline}** post-Second World
War **[integration process]{.underline}**. Third Parties Last but not
least, **[a new transatlantic partnership]{.underline}** more firmly
**[based on both participants' autonomy would enable the
EU]{.underline}**, but also the USA, **[to review their relations with
third parties]{.underline}**. Take, for example, Russia. Among other
reasons, **[the EU-Russia relationship, important because
of]{.underline}** the density of **[trade, investment and
energy]{.underline}** links but marred by endless negotiations on a new
strategic agreement, **[is held back because of]{.underline}** Moscow's
frustration that it cannot discuss security with the EU, which tends to
refer to **[NATO]{.underline}** instead. **[As long as Europe labels
NATO as its primary security organization, Moscow is likely to regard
the EU's neighbourhood policies as affiliated with the alliance's
enlargement agenda]{.underline}**, given the expressed synergies between
these two 'EuroAtlantic organizations'. More broadly speaking, **[the
outside world will look at Europe as a more serious interlocutor as it
depends less on US security guarantees]{.underline}**. Sticking to the
Russia example, the US, lacking the economic dimension in its
relationship with Moscow, is perfectly capable of concluding deals on
strategic issues, such as the recent START agreement on nuclear
arsenals. But many, not all, of the bilateral irritants concern Europe
and are NATO related. It is probably no coincidence that Russian
compliance with START has been made dependent on missile defence
developments in Europe.

### Impacts \-\-- Euro Power k LL

#### Solves [global hotspot escalation]{.underline}.

**Weinstein 14 --** Kenneth R. Weinstein, President and Chief Executive
Officer of Hudson Institute, "Why the US Needs Europe", Aspen Institute,
http://www.aspeninstitutece.org/en/article/1-2014-why-the-us-needs-europe/

This crisis notwithstanding, **[the U.S. needs closer engagement with
Europe on crucial defense and foreign policy matters]{.underline}**. The
U.S. under President Obama may be turning inward; but the fact remains:
Europe is vital and irreplaceable to us.

History and culture bind the U.S. and Europe together; Europe discovered
us, shaped our thinking, and forms of government. But there is more than
just cultural affinity that unites us. There is a deep moral scope to
the alliance. It was, after all, in the West that concepts such as
limited government, individual rights, freedom of worship, free markets,
and equal rights for women arose. The moral basis of our alliance
embodied in these concepts was critical to our heroic joint efforts
leading the fierce external opposition to totalitarianism that helped
bring down the Iron Curtain.

**[The [common defense threats]{.mark} we face in the 21st
century---almost all on the periphery of the U.S. or the EU---are
different in scope and kind: conventional challenges such as
[Russia]{.mark} bent on [dominating]{.mark} its near abroad or
[China's]{.mark} increasing a[ssertiveness]{.mark} in territorial
matters and growing military prowess; others are unconventional,
including the spread of radical Islam and [terrorism]{.mark} in the
Middle East and beyond, and the [prolif]{.mark}eration of weapons of
mass destruction to countries such as [Iran]{.mark} and [North
Korea]{.mark}. In an age of [extremist ideologies]{.mark}, non-state
actors with increasingly widespread technological capacities could pose
the [greatest threats]{.mark} of all [to international
order]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

**[Other challenges that arise from the "[arc of instability"]{.mark} to
the south of Europe]{.underline}**---including migration and unruly
political transitions in the Arab world---**[[require]{.mark} a mix of
hard and soft power. The diplomatic flexibility that approaches by [a
multiplicity of states]{.mark} in [Europe]{.mark} can
afford]{.underline}**--- combined with the potential threat of hard
power when necessary---**[[offers the most diverse]{.mark} set of
[tools]{.mark} to handle such crises]{.underline}**.

Our moral message and policy prescriptions are much stronger when
unified; we are able to achieve far more together than alone. But to
achieve unity, as the last decade has shown, we really have to work at
it. This means more than occasional consultations, after the fact, as
has often been the case during the Obama administration.

Strong U.S.-European relations require regular consultations, give and
take, even blunt conversations--- not just lectures from Washington or
from Brussels or European capitals---to give Europeans a stake of
ownership in policies. This ownership will allow them and us to make the
case for shared sacrifice to their and our polities---a case that needs
to be made in politics since the choices officials face in security
policy are often less than optimal. The failure of American leadership
since 2009 to make such arguments at home has weakened our ability to
expect our allies to make the same kinds of cases to their publics,
thereby harming the alliance.

**[[American cannot "go it alone." Europe offers]{.mark} America [an
invaluable tool: a key multilateral dimension]{.mark} to policy. With
it, comes [greater credibility]{.mark} in the international arena
[and]{.mark} a greater [capacity]{.mark} to undertake complex
missions]{.underline}**. America has to lead, but Europe has to be our
partner, willing to be vocal when we are unwilling to meet out
responsibilities. Without it comes the excessive swings of American
foreign and defense policy that have led us, in recent years, to shirk
our global responsibilities.

Europeans contributed in crucial ways to the US-led interventions in
Iraq and Afghanistan and were absolutely central to the intervention in
Libya. France's willingness to intervene in Mali and the Central African
Republic with assistance from the U.S. and the E.U. at a time when the
U.S. is less willing on new anti-terror interventions is a very positive
sign. But French interventionism, as welcome as it is, cannot make up
for shrinking defense budgets and reluctant leadership from both Germany
and the U.K. The U.S. needs to encourage its allies to assume their
responsibilities.

Although Europe's armed forces are less strong and less well equipped
than desirable, European armed forces are, in fact, well-trained,
technologically sophisticated and also geographically closer to the
regions that are likely to be critical in the 21st century---North
Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The
manpower and cost efficiencies from potential joint operations cannot be
overstated.

Europeans can bring unmatched sensibilities in their own backyard, but
need to assume their responsibilities. Their knowledge of history and
culture is essential. This knowledge and willingness to use "soft power"
has to be joined to a sense of the importance of burden sharing,
especially as American forces are overstretched in a time of declining
American defense budgets.

Increasing isolationism in both American political parties should serve
as a wakeup call to Europe that we might not always be there to help
police Europe's periphery as in Kosovo or Libya.

The greater distance we are assuming from Europe should make us all the
more sympathetic to European defense initiatives. Given the deeper
challenges we face, it is time to leave aside "theological" debates over
whether NATO or the EU should be the prime focus for the future of
European defense. Instead, we need to focus on how best to meet common
strategic challenges with the array of resources, diplomatic and
military, that we can muster.

**[When Europeans and Americans work together]{.underline}** for shared
purpose, **[the partnership]{.underline}** enhances us both and
**[makes]{.underline}** our **[complex]{.underline}** and simultaneous
**[missions much easier to accomplish]{.underline}**.

only do the classic tools of power play a role, but **[soft power itself

other cultural products, the capacity to build social networks or the
ability to attract talent. **[Trade, technology, data, information are

Europeans feel they live in an increasingly dangerous and unpredictable
world. They need to be reassured that we can provide a meaningful and
robust European answer. **[If the EU does not become also a real world
power, in terms of both hard and soft power,]{.underline}** **[it will
be at the mercy of other international actors]{.underline}**. And
**[this will affect]{.underline}** all fields of our lives:
**[communication, economy, environment, security]{.underline}**. **[Even
our democracies and individual rights and liberties would be in danger.
Europe needs to act more united.]{.underline}** To avoid this fate,
[**[Europe must strengthen its traditional levers]{.underline}**,
**[look for new ones and take new and visible initiatives to enhance its
global posture]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[. Europe needs]{.underline}** at
first **[to act in a more united way]{.underline}**. And frankly, the EU
is the only platform enabling European democracies to promote and defend
their interests effectively. In the past, we have sometimes allowed
others to paralyse us by dividing us, for example with regard to our
relations with China or Russia. We must stop seeing Europe as a
collection of national interests and instead define and defend together
the common European interest. This is in particular the aim of the work
undertaken with the European defence ministers around the "Strategic
Compass" concept, to jointly define the threats and challenges that
Europe will have to face. "[**[Strategic autonomy]{.underline}**" **[is
about defending our interests and values by acting multilaterally
whenever we can, but being ready to act autonomously whenever we
must."]{.underline}**]{.mark} We need to strengthen our capacities to
act autonomously. The concept of "Strategic autonomy" is not about
protectionism but about having the capacity to defend our interests and
values by acting multilaterally whenever we can, but being ready to act
autonomously whenever we must. **[We have more levers that we
think]{.underline}** To achieve this, we have more levers of influence
than we ourselves often believe. Our internal market is still one of the
most important in the world and no external player can afford to neglect
it[. **[The European Union has one of the strongest "soft power"
toolboxes, with powerful trade and competition policies, significant aid
volumes and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the new possibilities offered by
our [investment screening mechanisms. We must use it to its full
potential]{.mark}, taking a holistic approach and overcoming
silos.]{.underline}** The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the fragility of
existing global value chains and Europe's vulnerability in that regard.
Re-localisation and economic sovereignty have become dominant themes
everywhere in Europe As I expressed earlier with Commissioner Thierry
Breton, we need to link closely our industrial and research policy with
our foreign policy. **["Re-localisation and economic sovereignty have
become dominant themes. We need to link closely our industrial and
research policy with our foreign policy".]{.underline}** We are the most
important norm setter worldwide --as Anu Bradford convincingly sketches
in her recent book "The Brussels Effect" - but we cannot maintain this
position if we are not also a technological leader: we need to close the
gap between our regulatory capacity and our technological ambitions. We
need to protect key technological sectors from falling under excessive
control by a third party and to ensure the security of vital sectors
such as digital, energy, raw materials and health. We must protect our
critical infrastructure (from energy to space), and our digital autonomy
and security (international digital rules/standards, cybersecurity). We
should also leverage the renewed political priorities of the EU Next
generation instrument on digital or environmental issues in the context
of the programming of our assistance and other external policies. **[The
principle of reciprocity is key Relations with foreign partners must be
evaluated according to the principle of reciprocity]{.underline}**. This
must become the rule, not the exception, while of course bearing in mind
the need to take into account different levels of development and
overall strategic interests. The rules that we impose on European
companies, particularly with regard to subsidies, must also apply to
non-European companies that want to enter our market. "Where necessary,
**[we should be ready to adopt a more robust and strategic approach as
we have done for instance with China]{.underline}**." Where necessary,
we should be ready to adopt a more robust and strategic approach as we
have done for instance with China. We **[have worked to build our
relationship with China on more reciprocity and a level playing field in
trade, investment and beyond. By highlighting our political differences,
we have achieved that Beijing has to take Europe more
seriously.]{.underline}** In parallel, **[we need to continue giving
full priority to our very troubled neighbourhood both to the East and
the South, and to Africa]{.underline}**. **[Our partners' stability and
prosperity are crucial for the EU's own security and strategic
interests]{.underline}**. We have also to strengthen our common action
in the field of security and defence and foster the EU's capacity to act
as a global security provider. "**[The EU has a strong stake in
maintaining and developing a rules-based international order within the
framework of an effective multilateralism]{.underline}**." The EU has a
strong stake in maintaining and developing a rules-based international
order within the framework of an effective multilateralism -- even if
others are clearly trying to weaken it. The joint Communication on
Multilateralism that we are planning for next year will set out what the
EU can do to counter this trend. Over the years, the EU has been quite
successful on the climate issue but we must also contribute more
actively to reform what needs to be changed, for example in the WHO and
WTO. "As EU we can and should do more to develop a level playing field
when it comes to social and human rights." **[As EU we can and should do

[**[For the EU-India strategic partnership to reach its full

the limitations of bilateral relations. To persuade India of the
benefits of dealing with the EU as a collective actor, **[the EU should
leverage its soft power]{.underline}**. **[The EU is finally beginning
to grasp the importance of strong and coordinated public diplomacy and
efforts to restructure and intensify it are ongoing]{.underline}**.
However, **[now is the time to define clear objectives and strategies to
obtain them. [Member states need to allow the EU the necessary strategic
autonomy]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[for it to take the lead in
coordinating their actions in India]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Moreover,
[**[for the EU to defend multilateralism]{.underline}**, **[it needs to
live up to it,]{.underline}**]{.mark} which means some painful changes
for its members in giving up their primacy at the table of multilateral
organisations such as the IMF or the UN. Meanwhile, beyond the imminent
appointment of a military attaché to the EU mission in India, **[[the EU
needs to shed its reluctance as a global security actor and work
together with India on security cooperation.]{.mark} The Indian
administration barely considers the EU as an actor]{.underline}**,
focusing its attention more on individual member states (notably UK,
Germany and France, and, more recently and to a lesser degree, the
Eastern countries). India turns these bilateral relations to its
advantage in striking deals on better terms, playing on the occasionally
prickly competition between member states. **[The strongest competitors
of EU Members]{.underline}** for tapping into Indian potential **[are
Russia, the US, and China]{.underline}**. **[Without robust and
coordinated EU engagement]{.underline}**, **[bilateral relations between
EU member states and India may survive, but they will not
thrive]{.underline}**. There is, for example, no de-facto European
chamber of commerce in India, only some national chambers. For the
relationship to be deepened, both sides will need to take significant
steps. **[The EU has to prove its added value]{.underline}**, but the
Indian government also has to act. India's external trade position is
still in its infancy. Its trade and regulatory environment remains
relatively restrictive, with discriminatory and diverging standards. Its
central government has limited powers, possibly even less than the EU.
Many competences remain with its 29 states, which restricts its capacity
for outreach. India has also a very limited external presence, with less
than 1,000 diplomats abroad -- similar in number to those of the
Netherlands with a population of just 1% that of India.

the German EU Presidency, but this does not preclude Brussels and Delhi
to walk the talk from sharing a similar worldview to building up a more
concrete partnership.

With the exception of France (who, by the way, views India as a
strategic partner), **[the EU has been slow to react to the trade
war]{.underline}** between United States and China **[and to the
weakening of the rules-based international order.]{.underline}** Caught
off guard, the **[EU is seeking to regain the lost ground and to be
influential beyond its immediate neighborhood]{.underline}**. Although
**[some have argued that the Union should first deal with the economic
and political reverberations of Brexit]{.underline}**, that an internal
consolidation is mandatory before enlargement to the Western Balkans or
that a "global strategy" is too much of a task, others have rightly
pointed out that the **[international realignments]{.underline}**,
**[especially the unilateralism of a Trumpian]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and the rise
of]{.underline}** a perhaps **[overconfident China, risk to transform
the very context in which the Union operates.]{.underline}**

**[There is no clear solution to the EU's Trump problem]{.underline}**.
For example, France's plans for more defense and security cooperation --
a step to compensate for the unpredictability of Washington -- have been
received with caution in Berlin and with sheer mistrust in Central and
Eastern Europe. Calling NATO brain dead does not help either. In all
honesty, the hope in Brussels is that the US will come back to its old
strategy after the disruptive president is defeated in the elections
next year in November. But **[Trump may]{.underline}** actually **[win
again]{.underline}**, **[and Europe hasn't got a plan B for 4 more years
except for an ambitious]{.underline}** \"strategic autonomy\" which is
hard to predict in terms of actual progress. **[Europe also pays more
attention to the moves of China]{.underline}**, first within its own
borders and then in different parts of the world. After the U.S. has
used its leverage with some Central and Eastern countries, Germany seems
to reconsider its initial open stance on 5G. More generally, **[Chinese
investments will be analyzed not only through an economic lens, but also
by factoring in technological transfer, access to innovation and
patents, and the buzzword \"reciprocity\". Investment screening is now
available at EU level and will be used when needed. However, all these
steps are rather reactionary, risking being perceived as the desperate
moves of waning (soft) power.]{.underline}**

[**[This is where the relation with India could play an important
part]{.underline}**. **[The EU is one of the strongest believers in the
current rules-based international
order]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[,]{.underline}** **[in globalization and
free trade]{.underline}**. Nonetheless, **[internal
divisions]{.underline}**, **[demography and the international logic
prevent the Union to act alone and it has to look for valuable
partnerships]{.underline}**. **[Building an alliance of major
players]{.underline}**, **[emerging powers and small states is not an
easy task]{.underline}**, but **[actions have been taken]{.underline}**:
the **[recently entered into force FTA with Japan]{.underline}**, the
**[enhanced cooperation with Canada]{.underline}** or the attempt to
give real substance to the partnership with India. Showcasing that
**[there is an alternative to great power competition and that a
different world dynamic is possible]{.underline}**, takes off if, for
example, **[[EU can coordinate with a major country like India on
matters of deep significance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[This is entirely
consistent with the Indian ethos]{.underline}** based on throwing off
the notion that the world is a battle between two things/powers --
something that could be thought by observing the US -- China cold war.
By making such a bet, **[Europe could indeed demonstrate that it can
escape strategic defensive: the EU has the potential to contribute to a
soft rebalancing in Asia, but of a type that is different from a US
\"China containment\" strategy.]{.underline}** If this is the strategic
dimension, then **[the challenge will be to move towards real progress
at the sectoral level]{.underline}**. Fortunately, **[[there is a long
list of topics of common interest]{.underline}]{.mark}** that can really
receive greenlight once the existential, key aspects of the cooperation
have been sorted out. **[Connectivity]{.underline}**, **[[nuclear
nonproliferation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[investment in
new]{.underline}** (**[[environmental)
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nologies and **[[maritime
security]{.underline}]{.mark}** (for instance, **[the Indian Ocean could
become a bridge, with impact on joint naval patrolling or something even
bolder such as space operations]{.underline}**) **[are on everyone's
mind]{.underline}**. **[Europe has already the financial tools to invest
in India's infrastructure and to show to the other countries of the
region that the]{.underline}** Belt and Road Initiative
(**[BRI]{.underline}**) **[is not the only game in town; for example,
there is potential for coastal cities twinning between Europe and India,
with investments and mutual benefits]{.underline}**. **[[Climate change
mitigation is another area of convergent interest]{.underline}]{.mark}**
-- let's only think about the opportunities for the recycle economy.
**[What is essential here]{.underline}**, as others have suggested,
**[is that trade is only a small part of the bigger
picture]{.underline}**. **[The long-term goal is to bring together
like-minded powers such as the EU, India, Japan, Australia and ASEAN and
to set the way forward for reimagining a world order under big pressure
today. The time to go strategic has arrived]{.underline}**.

**[Rising Strategic Uncertainty in the Indian Ocean The pursuit of
contesting regional orders by major powers has engendered a strategic
environment of uncertainty and mistrust in the
Indo-Pacific.]{.underline}** **[As geopolitical developments at land and
sea feed off one another, the maritime domain has been marked as the
latest theater of war]{.underline}**. These dynamics have been most
evident in the East and South China Seas, where the complexity of issues
at hand is telling. A case in point is **[China's construction of
military facilities on artificial islands proximate to disputed maritime
areas, against a backdrop of contesting interpretations of international
law. [As]{.mark} regional and extra-regional [states face a rising
China]{.mark} on all fronts[, a climate of strategic anxiety
prevails]{.mark} [in anticipation of its]{.mark} potential [impact on
the]{.mark} existing [rules-based international
order]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Such [anxieties]{.mark} inevitably
[spill over into the Indian Ocean]{.mark} Region and manifest in ways
unique to that part of the world]{.underline}**. **[[A rising
India]{.mark} with aspirations to global-power status [finds its
regional dominance challenged by China's two-ocean strategy and
B]{.mark}elt and [R]{.mark}oad [I]{.mark}nitiative]{.underline}**. In
the maritime realm, **[India's response comprises internal naval and
port modernization, and increased naval engagements and exercises with
neighboring littorals and external powers that have major stakes in the
region]{.underline}**. This has not, however, had any noticeable effects
in tempering regional anxieties. **[[Heavy maritime traffic]{.mark} in
increasingly congested regional waters [operate alongside this tense
backdrop]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The risk that various surface
vessels could collide]{.underline}**---whether naval or
commercial---**[and the risk of submarine accidents is on the
rise]{.underline}**. A number of regional and extra-regional states have
forward-deployed their navies in the Indian Ocean, independently or as
part of various task forces. **[There have already been several maritime
accidents involving warships and air crashes in the Persian Gulf and the
northern Arabian Sea between regional and extra-regional navies---some
of which escalated]{.underline}** politically. The Iranian Navy, for
instance, has confronted its smaller neighbors and the U.S. Navy by
conducting high-speed naval maneuvers and missile firings, and it has
used drones to shadow U.S. naval assets. Late last year, an Indian
submarine attempted to enter into waters close to Gwadar Port and was
reportedly repelled by the Pakistan Navy. **[Miscommunications and
[misperceptions are likely to result from]{.mark} [such incidents and
could escalate very fast to negative]{.mark} political and [military
expressions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is against this setting that a

Conclusion

**[The US and China]{.underline}** both **[have a tendency to treat the
EU as an object]{.underline}** of international relations **[rather than
a subject]{.underline}** -- **[competing to enlist it on their side, or
to prevent it aligning with the other side, but not treating it as
having agency. The EU often plays to]{.underline}** this image of
**[passivity, seeming always to follow others in reacting to
crises]{.underline}** -- its initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic
being an example of that. But **[in reality, the EU has power, if it can
agree internally on how to use it.]{.underline}** As Charles Michel,
President of the European Council, said after the EU-China leaders'
videoconference on September 14th, **[[Europe needs to be a
player]{.mark}, not a playing field. Europe should [not get sucked
into]{.mark} a [contest between China and the US]{.mark} for global
hegemony]{.underline}**. Instead, **[[the EU should use]{.mark} whatever
[influence]{.mark} it can [to ensure]{.mark} that both [sides
exercise]{.mark} their [power with restraint and]{.mark} in a framework
of [rules]{.mark}, not simply on the basis]{.underline}** (as Thucydides
wrote) that "**[the strong do what they can, while the weak suffer what
they must". Europe should also accept that China is not converging with
the West]{.underline}** politically or in terms of its values: **[the
'responsible stakeholder' era is over almost before it
began.]{.underline}** Chinese and Western interests will sometimes
align, but Xi has shown less willingness than his predecessors to slot
China into the existing international system. At the same time, it is
impossible to know where Xi's policies will lead China in the long term.
Some scholars argue that the Chinese Communist Party's rule has been
made dysfunctional and brittle by Xi's centralisation of
power.[51](https://www.cer.eu/publications/archive/policy-brief/2020/europe-us-and-china-love-hate-triangle#FN-51)
Other analysts believe that China's rise is world-transforming and its
growing influence
irresistible.[52](https://www.cer.eu/publications/archive/policy-brief/2020/europe-us-and-china-love-hate-triangle#FN-52)
Europe should remember the (possibly apocryphal) story of Chinese Prime
Minister Zhou Enlai's 1972 verdict on the results of the French
revolution: "Too early to tell". It will be a long time before Xi's
policies can be judged successful or otherwise. Meanwhile, **[the EU
should]{.underline}** remain open to economic and other forms of
co-operation with China where they are to Europe's benefit; **[resist
Chinese activity that harms European states and institutions or their
allies]{.underline}**; **[and invest resources and diplomatic effort in
enabling]{.underline}** international **[organisations to adapt to the
rise of China without breaking]{.underline}**. The Trump era has made
the EU's job harder: Trump has deprived Europe of its most important
partner in defending the rules-based international order and universal
values. But **[[the EU cannot]{.mark} afford to [leave the
future]{.mark} of the world [to be settled]{.mark} in a series of trials
of strength [between Beijing and Washington]{.mark}]{.underline}**. When
relations between the US and China looked rosier, there was talk of a
'G2' to deal with the problems of the world. That was never a realistic
construct. **[For the foreseeable future, the three big economic and
political [powers]{.mark} in the world [will be China]{.mark}, the [EU
and]{.mark} the [US]{.mark}, and the triangular [relations]{.mark}
between them [will contain]{.mark} elements of attraction and elements
of [hostility]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Western firms will still want to
tap the Chinese market, while governments worry about threats to
national security; Chinese families will still want their children to
study in the West, while the Communist Party worries about the
ideological contamination they might bring back; and Europe and the US
will still be each other's most important security and economic
partners, while bickering about defence budgets and food safety. **[In
the absence of a friction-free utopia, [the EU's best option is to work
with Beijing and Washington to pursue]{.mark} pragmatic [policies that
maintain]{.mark} stable [relations]{.mark} between the
three.]{.underline}**

#### That goes [nuclear]{.underline}

**Talmadge 18**, Associate Professor of Security Studies at the Edmund
A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University (Caitlin
Talmadge, 10-15-2018, \"Beijing's Nuclear Option: Why a U.S.-Chinese War
Could Spiral Out of Control,\" Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-10-15/beijings-nuclear-option)

As China's power has grown in recent years, so, too, has the risk of war
with the United States. Under President Xi Jinping, **[China has
increased its]{.underline}** political and economic **[pressure on
Taiwan and built military installations on coral reefs in the
S]{.underline}**outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea,
fueling Washington's fears that **[[Chinese expansionism will
threaten]{.mark} U.S. [allies]{.mark} and influence in the
region]{.underline}**. U.S. destroyers have transited the Taiwan Strait,
to loud protests from Beijing. American policymakers have wondered aloud
whether they should send an aircraft carrier through the strait as well.
Chinese fighter jets have intercepted U.S. aircraft in the skies above
the South China Sea. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has brought
long-simmering economic disputes to a rolling boil. A war between the
two countries remains unlikely, but the prospect of **[a military
confrontation---resulting, for example, from a Chinese campaign against
Taiwan---no longer seems as implausible]{.underline}** as it once did.
And **[[the odds of]{.mark} such a [confrontation going nuclear are
high]{.mark}er than most policymakers and analysts think.]{.underline}**
Members of China's strategic com­munity tend to dismiss such concerns.
Likewise, U.S. studies of a potential war with China often exclude
nuclear weapons from the analysis entirely, treating them as basically
irrelevant to the course of a conflict. Asked about the issue in 2015,
Dennis Blair, the former commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific,
estimated the likelihood of a U.S.-Chinese nuclear crisis as "somewhere
between nil and zero." **[This assurance is misguided]{.underline}**. If
deployed against China, **[the [Pentagon's]{.mark} preferred style
of]{.underline}** conventional **[[warfare would be
a]{.underline}]{.mark}** potential **[[recipe for nuclear
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Since the end of the Cold War, **[the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' **[signature approach to
war has been simple: punch deep into enemy territory in order to rapidly
knock out the opponent's key military assets]{.underline}** at minimal
cost. But the Pentagon developed this formula in wars against
Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Serbia, none of which was a nuclear power.
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, by contrast, not only **[[has
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**; it has also
**[[intermingled]{.underline}]{.mark}** them
**[[with]{.underline}]{.mark}** its
**[[conventional]{.underline}]{.mark}** military **[[forces, making it
difficult to attack one without]{.mark} attacking [the
other]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This means that **[[a
major]{.underline}]{.mark}** U.S. military
**[[campaign]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[targeting China's conventional
forces [would]{.mark} likely also [threaten its nuclear
arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Faced with such a threat, **[[Chinese
leaders could]{.mark} decide to [use]{.mark} their [nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} while they were still able to.]{.underline}**

### Impacts \-\-- EU k Africa/Latin America War

#### East Asian, African and Latin American conflict coming now\-\--only EU can solve

Seán O **Regan 16**, Master's Degree in Commerce and Government from the
University College Cork, Postgraduate Diploma in Conflict and Dispute
Resolution from Trinity College, Dublin, Higher Diploma in Accounting,

"Conflict Resolution Revisited: Peaceful Resolution, Mediation and
Responsibility to Protect", All Azimuth: A Journal of Foreign Policy and
Peace, Volume 5, Issue 1, January, p. 70-73

Thus, **[there is a well-rehearsed commitment to the principle of peace
and by implication the peaceful resolution of disputes]{.underline}**.
The bipolar world order established after the Second World War made a
mockery of this commitment. The term **[[conflict
prevention]{.underline}]{.mark}** in this era **[[meant
containing]{.mark} the [potential for nuclear war between]{.mark} the
[major blocs]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The **[ideological
[struggle]{.mark}]{.underline}** between those blocs **[was [carried
into conflict all over the globe]{.mark}, notably [in]{.mark} East
[Asia]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Korea and Vietnam),
**[[Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}** (the Congo and Angola) **[[and Latin
America]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Chile and Nicaragua).
**[The]{.underline}** international community's
**[response]{.underline}** was generally **[to insert
[peacekeeping]{.mark} forces]{.underline}** between parties in conflict
**[[without]{.underline}]{.mark}** necessarily **[[dealing
with]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[root causes]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of the conflict. Many such conflicts **[[ended
with]{.underline}]{.mark}** the collapse of the Soviet Union, but
**[long-suppressed [animosities]{.mark}]{.underline}** between the
constituent republics of **[[that]{.underline}]{.mark}** Union and its
client states **[[erupted]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The international
community's **[failure to deal with]{.underline}** the
**[ethnic/sectarian conflicts in the Caucasus and South Eastern
Europe]{.underline}** on the one hand and the Rwanda genocide on the
other **[impelled discussion of conflict prevention]{.underline}** from
academia to foreign policy formation. While the UN and the OSCE had
long-standing commitments to conflict prevention, exercise of all
possible options was in practice limited by international politics. When
it became clear that, as Smith12 put it, the balance of terror of the
Cold War would not be replaced by peace and security, the issue of
conflict prevention became prominent for the international community.

3\. Current Conflict Resolution Practice

Van Waalraven13 explored the conflict policies of a sample of Western
countries (Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United
Kingdom) and found that general conflict policy, as against specific
conflict intervention, was embedded in other, mainly development
assistance, policies. He found it difficult to identify generic
approaches to conflict prevention, although all countries examined used
similar language in their descriptions of conflict and its causes, even
if there was only vague consensus on what those causes are.

The Council of **[the [E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion]{.underline}**,
at its June 2001 meeting in Gothenburg,14 **[endorsed]{.underline}** a
programme of **[conflict [prevention]{.mark}]{.underline}**,15 stating
this **[would "improve the Union's capacity to undertake coherent early
warning, analysis and action \[to prevent conflict\]" and]{.underline}**
that "\[c\] onflict prevention **[[is one of the main objectives]{.mark}
of the Union's external relations]{.underline}** and should be
integrated in all its relevant aspects." **[This]{.underline}** document
and the European Security Strategy16 **[provided the foundation
for]{.underline}** the **[elaboration of a whole series of policies,
including]{.underline}** the promotion of **[mediation]{.underline}** in
conflict prevention and resolution. It was followed in 2009 by the
"Concept on Strengthening EU Mediation and Dialogue Capacities,"17 which
uses the term mediation to encompass improved communication,
negotiation, dialogue and facilitation through the offices of a third
party, namely the EU. In this document mediation can be directive and
coercive. **[[It]{.mark} also [notes]{.mark} the [EU's]{.mark} financial
[power and]{.mark} moral [authority as positive factors in]{.mark} a
[mediation]{.mark} process]{.underline}**.

#### Africa instability escalates

Walter **Mead** **13**. James Clarke Chace Professor of Foreign Affairs
and Humanities, Bard College. "Peace in The Congo? Why the World Should
Care." The American Interest. 12-15-2013.
<https://www.the-american-interest.com/2013/12/15/peace-in-the-congo-why-the-world-should-care/>

**[One of the biggest questions of the 21st century is whether [this
destructive dynamic]{.mark} can be contained, or whether the demand for
ethnic, cultural and/or religious homogeneity [will]{.mark} continue to
[convulse world politics]{.mark}, drive new generations of conflict, and
create millions more victims]{.underline}**. **[The Congo
conflict]{.underline}** is a disturbing piece of evidence
**[suggest]{.underline}**ing that, in Africa at least, **[[there is
potential for]{.mark} this kind of conflict]{.underline}**. The Congo
war (and the long Hutu-Tutsi conflict in neighboring countries) is not,
unfortunately alone. The secession of South Sudan from Sudan proper, the
wars in what remains of that unhappy country, the secession of Eritrea
from Ethiopia and the rise of Christian-Muslim tension right across
Africa (where religious conflict often is fed by and intensifies
"tribal"---in Europe we would say "ethnic" or "national"---conflicts)
are strong indications that the potential for **[[huge]{.mark} and
[destructive conflict across Africa]{.mark}]{.underline}** is very real.

But one must look beyond Africa. The Middle East of course is aflame in
religious and ethnic conflict. The old British Raj including India,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma and Sri Lanka offers countless examples of
ethnic and religious conflict that sometimes is contained, and sometimes
boils to the surface in horrendous acts of violence.

Beyond that, rival nationalisms in East and Southeast Asia are keeping
the world awake at night.

**[The Congo war should be a reminder to us all that the [foundations of
our world are dynamite]{.mark}, and that the [potential for]{.mark} new
[conflicts on the scale of]{.mark} the horrific wars of [the 20th
century is]{.mark} very much [with us]{.mark} today]{.underline}**.

The second lesson from this conflict stems from the realization of how
much patience and commitment from the international community (which in
this case included the Atlantic democracies and a coalition of African
states working as individual countries and through various international
institutions) it has taken to get this far towards peace. Particularly
at a time when many Americans want the US to turn inwards, there are
people who make the argument that it is really none of America's
business to invest time and energy in the often thankless task of
solving these conflicts.

That might be an ugly but defensible position if we didn't live in such
a tinderbox world. Someone could rationally say, yes, it's terrible that
a million plus people are being killed overseas in a horrific conflict,
but the war is really very far away and America has urgent needs at home
and we should husband the resources we have available for foreign policy
on things that have more power to affect us directly.

**[The problem is that these [wars spread]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[They may start in places that we don't care much about]{.underline}**
(most Americans didn't give a rat's patootie about whether Germany
controlled the Sudetenland in 1938 or Danzig in 1939) **[but they tend
to spread to places that we do care very much about]{.underline}**. This
can be because a revisionist great power like Germany in 1938-39 needs
to overturn the balance of power in Europe to achieve its goals, or it
can be because **[instability in a very remote place triggers problems
in places that we care about very much]{.underline}**. Out of
Afghanistan in 2001 came both 9/11 and the **[waves of insurgency and
[instability]{.mark} that threaten to rip nuclear-armed Pakistan apart
or with [trigger]{.mark} wider [conflict India]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[Out of the mess in Syria a witches' brew of terrorism and religious
conflict looks set to complicate the security of our allies in Europe
and the Middle East and even the security of the oil supply on which the
world economy so profoundly depends]{.underline}**.

**[[Africa]{.mark}, and the potential for upheaval there, [is of]{.mark}
more [importance to American security]{.mark} than many people may
understand]{.underline}**. **[The line between Africa and the Middle
East is a soft one]{.underline}**. The **[weak states]{.underline}**
that straddle the southern approaches of the Sahara **[are ideal petri
dishes for Al Qaeda type groups]{.underline}** **[to form and attract
local support]{.underline}**. **[There are networks of funding and
religious contact that give groups in these countries potential access
to funds, fighters, training and weapons from the Middle
East]{.underline}**. **[A [war in the]{.mark} eastern
[Congo]{.mark}]{.underline}** might not directly trigger these other
conflicts, but it **[helps to [create]{.mark} the [swirling underworld
of arms trading]{.mark}, money transfers, [illegal commerce]{.mark} and
the rise of a generation of young men who become [experienced
fighters]{.mark}---and know no other way to make a
living]{.underline}**. **[It [destabilizes]{.mark} the environment for
[neighboring states]{.mark} (like Uganda and Kenya) that play much more
direct role in potential crises of greater concern to us]{.underline}**.

As noted previously, **[[there is]{.underline}]{.mark}** arguably **[[no
region]{.underline}]{.mark}** (including Asia) upon **[[which the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is more dependent for]{.mark}
its]{.underline}** prosperity and **[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
and with which it is more closely tied through bonds of family, than
Latin America and the Caribbean. In terms of trade and investment, from
manufacturers to the food Americans put on the table, there is no region
for which disruption of commerce with the United States could do more
damage to our economy and the everyday lives of Americans. Reciprocally,
the region's proximity to the United States makes it a logical and
attractive business partner; there is not another region of the world

any less strategic. **[The Challenge of Transnational Organized Crime in

anti-U.S. governments, such as the "Bolivarian Socialist" government of

such a conflict]{.underline}** (however undesirable) **[entirely as an

Russia and China may be expected to leverage such assets and
relationships [in Latin America]{.mark} and the
Caribbean]{.underline}**, in addition to other regions, **[in order to

**[You might argue that it can only be a good thing if the Europeans

service to the idea of CSDP while refusing to participate in any
meaningful way. Even the arch-federalist European Parliament, in its
most recent report on EU defence, noted that "in over 15 years of

lack of political consensus among Member States and the complexity of

At NATO HQ in the early '90s, the French were already pushing for

consequence, nonsensically, two allied navies operated in the Adriatic
and Mediterranean, one under NATO command and the other under

the two. Once the Bosnian military operations got more serious, even
France gave up on this farce and backed the NATO option.

3.1.2 Reconciling Strategic Sovereignty and the Transatlantic
Relationship The idea that the EU must have the capacity for autonomous
action, backed up by credible military forces, the means to decide to
use them, and a readiness to do so, in order to respond to military
crises goes back to the 1998 St. Malo Declaration. Since then, **[the
question of what constitutes an acceptable balance between a more
independent European security and defence policy and transatlantic
security cooperation in NATO has been hotly disputed on both sides of
the Atlantic]{.underline}**. The fear of upsetting the US and
jeopardising the American security commitment to Europe was a good
reason for many European member states to keep EU defence efforts to a
minimum. However, the election of Donald Trump as US president has
decisively changed the parameters of the debate. The US' strong
footprint in European security could no longer be taken for granted. For
many Europeans, this was a wake-up moment that brought the need for
greater autonomy from the US back into focus. At the same time, **[the
very notion of 'strategic autonomy' became toxic]{.underline}**.
**[While Europeans insisted that strategic autonomy was not synonymous
with a Europe 'going it alone', Washington, but also some EU member
states, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, perceived it as an
attempt for de-coupling and hence as a threat]{.underline}**. On this
account, **[German defence minister]{.underline}** Annegret
**[KrampKarrenbauer spoke on behalf of many Europeans]{.underline}**

November 2020**[:]{.underline}** '**[The idea of strategic autonomy for

Before proceeding, **[it is]{.underline}** **[worth spelling
out]{.underline}** **[the extent to which European security is
dependent]{.underline}** on NATO and **[in particular on the
US]{.underline}**. Of the EU's 27 member states, 21 are members of NATO.
These countries account for about 93% of the population1 of the EU.
**[Within NATO]{.underline}**, those **[Allies that are also EU members
only account for about 20% of total defence expenditure across the
Alliance, while the US alone accounts for about 70% of the same
total]{.underline}**.2 Beyond these aggregate indicators, **[it is
furthermore the case that the US is considerably ahead of the EU in
terms of practical adoption of AI]{.underline}**. For illustration,
**[in 2020 US private-sector investment in AI was around \$23.6 billion,
but was only \$2 billion in the EU, implying a ratio of 12 to 1 in
favour of the US]{.underline}** (Zhang et al. 2021, 96). Scientific
output indicators offer a more nuanced picture. **[In]{.underline}**
2019, the EU accounted for 16.4% of the world's **[peer-reviewed AI
publications]{.underline}**, ahead of the US with 14.6%, while China
occupied the top spot with 22.4% (Zhang et al. 2021, 20). On the other
hand, if one measures research output **[in terms of publications on the
Arxiv database, the US is ahead of the EU]{.underline}** (Zhang et al.
2021, 33) **[by a ratio of almost two to one]{.underline}**, which is
**[nonetheless much less than the large gap in private
investment]{.underline}** mentioned above. That **[the EU
performs]{.underline}** similarly to the US in terms of scientific
research, but **[far less well in terms of investment and
commercialisation of new digital technologies,]{.underline}** is **[an
old problem which has proven very difficult to address, whether at
national or EU level]{.underline}** (Baroudy et al. 2020).

However, **[the difference in how commitment to respective sets of
values is executed in NATO and EU results with a wide portfolio of
cooperational problems, ranging from bureaucratic to strategic, despite
their intention to work together.]{.underline}** Could there be
comprehensive and mutually respectful cooperation between the two
organizations on security issues? Would this cooperation be wearproof
given the bilateral conflicts brought up by non-joint members, such as
in the Cyprus dilemma? This article surveys how **[bilateral and
regional conflicts challenge the international resolve for transatlantic
security cooperation]{.underline}**, in which NATO and EU share common
milito-political interest.

The European Common Security and Defense Policy: Boon or Bane

The **[Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP)]{.underline}**, known
before 2009's Lisbon Treaty as the European Security and Defence Policy,
**[represented the apex of security cooperation among European Union
member states and]{.underline}** the EU's undertaking of a heavier
defence role along with **[NATO]{.underline}**. The CSDP seeks to
exercise European military independence from NATO within five areas: the
self-assured security of the EU, a closer relationship between eastern
and western Europe, structural improvement in European conflict
management, cooperation between neighboring regions, and pioneering
global governance of conflicts. To implement these priorities into
pre-existing European structural mechanisms, the EU's civilian-military
status has undergone an updating process. For instance, the European
External Action Service (EEAS) was created through the Lisbon Treaty,
signed in 2007, which made the EU constitutional laws legally binding
and further centralized the Union. The Lisbon Treaty also sought to
address the independent methods in which the EU member states were
answering international crises.

When EEAS was launched in December 2010 as an EU department with the
express function of consolidating EU responses to international security
issues as an autonomous unit, it actualized CSDP's vision for a new
European crisis management strategy which technically compelled member
states to cooperate in situations of security threats, in or out of the
EU. Initiatives similar to EAAS make clear **[what the EU lacks has not
been the incentive to incorporate an international security dimension to
its agenda, but the technical practicality to implement decisions to
that end in a unified manner]{.underline}**. **[Although common goals
had been set for NATO-EU cooperation through the Berlin Plus
Agreements]{.underline}** in 2003 **[before CSDP, creation of a unified
transatlantic defence and security policy between the two entities has
encountered ample executive difficulties]{.underline}**. For instance,
**[Cyprus -- an EU but not NATO member- was excluded from joint EU-NATO
meetings by Turkey -- a NATO but not EU member- due to the decades long
political antagonism over the Turkish invasion of Northern Cyprus in
1974]{.underline}**. **[Even this]{.underline}** **[seemingly
inconsequential]{.underline}** **[bilateral problem was enough to
\[halt\]]{.underline}**~~paralyze~~ the **[NATO-EU
cooperation]{.underline}**, **[making some organizational
details]{.underline}** of Berlin Plus Agreement
**[impossible]{.underline}**.

Berlin Agreement's **[decision to create a merged NATO-EU headquarters
in Brussels to manage conflicts in which both the EU and NATO have
common interests has not helped reduce the fracture between American and
European politics]{.underline}**. For instance, when France and Germany
coordinated a joint gathering with Belgium and Luxembourg to protest the
British-American invasion of Saddam Hussein's Iraq, NATO and then
American government denounced it as "Chocolate Summit," betraying the
spirit of cooperation aimed by CSDP. Joint NATO-EU missions for
stabilization in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2004, in Dafur, Sudan, as an
assistance to African Union or in Somali to combat piracy are, however,
some successful products of Berlin Plus Agreements. These joint
undertakings are cases in which not all the EU or NATO members were
interested in intervention, but they were made possible by sharing of
military expertise and assets from either of the parties, mostly by
NATO. However, post-colonial Africa and Western Balkans are regions over
which NATO and EU do not have strong strategic disagreements. **[Despite
Berlin Plus, EU has been critical of NATO's call for joint missions in
Afghanistan for instance and only supported the civilian projects of
current Resolute Support Mission of NATO.]{.underline}**

Bilateral hurdles in front of NATO-EU cooperation such as Cyprus Dispute
are hence not the actual root causes hindering the constructive attitude
of Berlin Plus. As Europe's disapproval of Iraqi invasion or reluctance
of cooperation in Afghanistan demonstrates, **[the CSDP cannot overcome
the]{.underline}** **[strategic divergence]{.underline}** **[of NATO and
EU in issues of incompatible political interests]{.underline}**.
**[Ideological divergence]{.underline}** of the two partners **[should
be reconciled before]{.underline}** the region specific problems are
addressed by calls for **[joint military actions]{.underline}**. The new
and more NATO-conscious level of ambition for CSDP thus required
European member states to invest more in security and defence, both
politically and economic. Perhaps an important undertaking was
revisiting Berlin Plus Agreement's comfort in EU utilizing NATO asset
and capabilities when necessary, instead initiating more EU-focused
solutions like EAAS.

**[With the attenuation of this cooperative ethos in both sides, there
is a present risk that NATO and the EU will begin to compete for limited
military resources]{.underline}**, straying from the envisioned Berlin
Plus Agreement. **[Lack of a coherent strategy among Western partners
could prevent efficient response to crises, which does not bode well in
a time of humanitarian atrocities]{.underline}** --- whether it be in
Syria, Yemen, or South Sudan.

**[EU TECHNOLOGICAL SOVEREIGNTY IS IN THE MAKING]{.underline}**

**[Behind the EU's recent]{.underline}** **[multiple sovereignty
agendas]{.underline}** **[is the need to stay ahead of the curve when it
comes to innovation.]{.underline}** The very label of a geopolitical
European Commission **[implies a new level of engagement for the EU in
the global balance of power. Technological and digital sovereignty are
at the heart]{.underline}** of such ambitions. The outbreak of the
**[coronavirus]{.underline}** pandemic has further **[exacerbated the
urgency to shore up technological, digital, and regulatory responses to
preserve the EU's economic clout, industrial competitiveness, and
geopolitical influence, as well as to reduce dependencies in critical
technology areas]{.underline}**. What has the EU done so far, and what
must it still do to meet that goal of technological sovereignty? Four
cross-cutting dimensions can help unpack the concept of technological
sovereignty and better structure the discussion about EU initiatives,
programs, and instruments: Research and capability-development efforts
in security and defense Investments in cutting-edge research and
innovation and in digitalization Critical infrastructure resilience and
security of supply Tech-related regulatory activism

DEFENSE CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT

According to Arnout Molenaar, the head of division in the European
External Action Service, dealing with security and defense policy is
also related to "a learning curve for the Union to develop a 'hard
power' mentality." Technology plays a fundamental role in terms of
making possible the EU's hard military power ambitions---not only to act
in a tense geopolitical setting but also to defend the EU's interests in
areas related to technology, security, and defense matters. In this
regard, **[collaborative EU defense research and development (R&D)
initiatives have been prioritized at the EU level for some time now to
support the competitiveness of the European Defence Technological and
Industrial Base]{.underline}**.

**[EU institutions and agencies have made considerable efforts to
preserve Europe's edge in key areas, including emerging and disruptive
security technologies and infrastructures such as cybersecurity, drones,
secure networks, space technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), and
quantum technology]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[recent EU initiatives such
as the]{.underline}** European Commission's European Defence Fund
(**[EDF]{.underline}**) **[as part of the EU's Multiannual Financial
Framework (MFF),]{.underline}** 2021--2027---**[as well
a]{.underline}**s its precursor programs, the **[Preparatory Action on
Defence Research and the European Defence Industrial Development
Programme---are intended to financially empower the EU's autonomy in
defense technology and industry and its research and innovation capacity
in future-oriented and disruptive defense technologies]{.underline}**.

Such **[initiatives have been framed as]{.underline}** **[timely
catalysts]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** potential **[game
changers]{.underline}** **[for increasing collective European action and
for fostering cutting-edge defense research and innovation in
Europe]{.underline}**. The **[commission funded the Preparatory Action
on Defence Research as a test case of defense-related research and
technology projects, pulling directly from the EU budget line rather
than from member states' joint initiatives]{.underline}**. **[This
scheme was a]{.underline}** **[concrete step]{.underline}** **[designed
to demonstrate the added value of EU-supported defense technology
research and innovation]{.underline}**. If successfully implemented, the
EDF is expected to bolster more lucrative and joint research and
capability-driven investment schemes in defense technologies across
Europe and to increase the EU's global leadership position in strategic
tech sectors. The commission has already pledged a relatively small
percentage of up to 8 percent of the EDF funding to disruptive
technology actions. However, with the initially proposed amount of 13
billion euros (\$15.4 billion) now reduced to about 8 billion euros
(\$9.5 billion), the EDF's real potential to create value added and to
incentivize technological and industrial cooperation and competitiveness
in Europe is unclear. Indeed, this reduction could be accounted for by
the fact that some member states either took a budget-restrictive
approach to the entire 2021--2027 MFF or judged that on balance, they
would benefit less from the EDF than their contribution to it and thus
opted for reducing the overall funding. What is certain is that the EDF
marks an important paradigm shift in consolidating the EU's increased
supranational activism in the field of defense technology and industry
as a basis for building the EU's military hard power and defense
portfolio. The fund also consolidates the European Commission's
increasing role and strong interventionism in the EU security and
defense policy fields that have traditionally been the exclusive
preserve of member states' decisionmaking.

**[There is]{.underline}** also **[a clear message that developing the
defense industry and technology base in Europe is key to strategic
autonomy]{.underline}**. Hence, logic dictates that defense-related
technological sovereignty is central to the EU's strategic autonomy.
Nonetheless, it remains to be seen whether the reduced funding dedicated
to the EDF and the small percentage of it that is flagged for disruptive
military technologies are sufficient to foster high-risk, high-reward
technological innovation in the European defense sector.

In the last five years, direct association between EU defence

European strategic autonomy has become widespread -- at least when this
term is understood to mean defence and a narrower understanding of
'security' rather than, say, economic self-reliance. Yet **[the pace of

PROBLEMS IN NATO-EU COOPERATION As the **[overall strategic interests
and security priorities of NATO and the EU have begun to overlap in
response to emerging global challenges]{.underline}**, **[the
relationship --- and hence cooperation --- between the two organizations
has become]{.underline}** more **[complex]{.underline}**. **[Limited
communication channels]{.underline}** Although personnel exchanges and
joint exercises have helped to set up a framework and a mindset for more
integrated operations, officials interviewed for this paper24 under the
condition of anonymity pointed out that **[information sharing and the
results achieved have been very limited]{.underline}**. The **[lack of a
secure communication system to share information between the two
organizations severely hinders their ability to work together on a daily
basis but most importantly to coordinate in a real crisis scenario and
consequently to put in place a joint response.]{.underline}** As of now,
**[there is no direct inter-institutional secure lines of communication
between the EU and NATO]{.underline}**. All communications take place
between each member state and either within NATO or within the EU. This
also is **[particularly relevant when it comes to sharing]{.underline}**
**[best practices]{.underline}** **[or handing over tasks from one
organization to the other.]{.underline}**25

**[Political tensions and different strategic priorities]{.underline}**
Adding to this communication difficulty, **[political tensions have
multiplied within both NATO and the EU, triggering a climate of distrust
that prevents intelligence sharing]{.underline}**. Turkey's purchase of
Russian S-400 surface-to-air missiles26 and its invasion of northern
Syria after U.S. troops withdrew raised security concerns in the
alliance, while the Northern Cyprus question and Ankara's activities in
the eastern Mediterranean waters have created tensions with Greece.27
Relations between France and the U.K. have also significantly worsened
since the AUKUS deal, which could ultimately impact the functioning of
NATO. Complicating matters further, as described above, **[the two
organizations' activities have started to overlap, with NATO embracing
capacity-building and cyber operations and the EU stepping up on crisis
management]{.underline}**. More recently, during preparation of its
strategic concept, NATO has been questioning its role in the fight
against climate change and in countering China's multifaceted influence
in the trans-Atlantic space. And following the AUKUS deal, the EU has
been reflecting on developing a stronger military to be able to respond
to crises directly impacting its security. **[NATO opposes any form of
duplication, from command to resources, which is quite telling in terms
of its soul-searching for the definition of its objectives and its range
of action vis-à-vis global challenges]{.underline}**.28 Recent **[events
in Afghanistan offer]{.underline}** a very good **[opportunity to
reflect on the role of NATO and EU aspirations]{.underline}**. After the
Taliban took back Kabul, NATO called for an assessment of the
accomplishments and failures of ISAF and Resolute Support.29 But instead
**[the EU]{.underline}** --- not directly **[involved in
Afghanistan]{.underline}** as an organization but rather **[through
individual member states]{.underline}** --- **[and the United Kingdom
reflected on their excessive dependence on the United States in areas of
paramount importance to European security]{.underline}**. As evacuation
operations started in Kabul, with devastating images traveling around
the world, Borrell defined Afghanistan as a "wake-up call" for the
strengthening of European defense.30 Allies complained about the United
States' lack of coordination and communication on the withdrawal, its
unwillingness to extend the deadline for evacuations. For its part, the
United Nation Security Council rejected a French-U.K. proposal to
establish of a U.N.-controlled safe zone around the Kabul airport.31
While it is debatable whether or not the EU would have used its
hypothetical army to secure Kabul's airport, **[the Afghanistan
experience exposed Europeans' vivid vulnerabilities in the security
domain and their dependence on the U.S. military's logistical and
technological capabilities.]{.underline}**

Arguments are made that limited European resources would be more
effective if integrated. This has become one of the EU's main selling
points for EU defence. It sounds plausible -- but **[if you add up the
defence budgets of 26 EU countries]{.underline}** (Denmark has opted out
of EU defence) **[you arrive at a figure of approximately \$200
billion]{.underline}** (2020) or 1.5% of the accumulated GDPs of these
countries. **[The US spent about \$800 billion]{.underline}**, which is
some 3.7% of GDP. And **[you certainly do not need EU involvement to
create joint forces with allies]{.underline}**. The history of
purposeful coalitions goes back centuries. In recent times, under NATO,
we have had the 14-nation ACE Mobile Force, the UK/Netherlands

is no need for EU involvement -- unless of course your motives are

The European Union's Juncker 26 Commission (2014-2019) actively avoided
regulating AI, causing the European Parliament to increase their efforts
as a proactive voice in favor of stronger AI regulation. However, since
the beginning of Ursula von der Leyen's tenure, the Commission has
initiated efforts to adopt stronger regulation for AI applications
(i.e., differentiating regulation of AI based on defined "high-risk" and
"low-risk" sectors") and associated data spaces.27,28 These legislative
proposals and their associated discussions are planned to be completed
by the end of 2020. During the strategic planning and budgeting process
of its R&D programs, the EU committed to providing at least EUR10.7

Surveying EU cybersecurity and public private partnerships

The [two EU agencies ENISA and EUROPOL are the main]{.underline} public
operational or [executive actors in the area of EU
cybersecurity]{.underline}. [Both actors are heavily dependent on
cooperation with private actors for]{.underline} their [organisational
success, and are supposed to cooperate increasingly with each
other]{.underline}. At the same time, they clearly have different
mandates and respective relationships with private actors. The following
overview therefore uses the typological differentiation with regard to
the central tasks of PPPs, namely information-sharing and active
assistance, and sets in relation to the different audience or layers
that the two agencies appeal to.15 By providing a structured overview of
the types of relationships these organisations engage in, we hope to
provide a clearer picture of what cybersecurity partnerships in this
area actually look like in practice.

ENISA

**[ENISA]{.underline}**, the **[European Union Agency for Network and
Information Security]{.underline}**, [is the main organisation for
structural cybersecurity]{.underline}, i.e. [at the infrastructural and
technical/ logical level]{.underline}. [ENISA]{.underline} was founded
in 2004 and [has gradually established itself as a **leading provider**
of technical advice in Europe]{.underline} (see Farrand and Carrapico in
this issue) In particular, [the agency produces a large]{.underline}
[volume of]{.underline} conceptual [papers and organises
exercises]{.underline},16 workshops [and expert meetings on
cybersecurity]{.underline}. In 2013, ENISA was given an expanded and
permanent legal basis, which defined its organisational mandate as
follows (\[92\], 43): The Agency should contribute to a high level of
network and information security, to better protection of privacy and
personal data, and to the development and promotion of a culture of
network and information security for the benefit of citizens, consumers,
businesses and public sector organisations in the Union, thus
contributing to the proper functioning of the internal market.\^ In
light of this, [regular interactions across the public-private divide
are]{.underline} clearly [**essential** to the work of
ENSIA]{.underline}. At a very general level, this can be illustrated by
the inclusion of private representatives in the so-called permanent
stakeholder group, which should assist the management of ENISA after the
last revision of its mandate. 17 But already well before, [ENISA
conducted extensive research on different models and potential of PPPs
in the ICT sector]{.underline} \[93\], which supports several arguments
made in the first part of this article. Thus, [the agency underlines
that private actors are often unwilling to share
info]{.underline}rmation [on a voluntary basis and that formal
agreements or structures are necessary to ensure the operational
usefulness of PPPs to both private and public actors]{.underline}. At
the same time, the [focus of ENISA on]{.underline} more infrastructural
[layers of cybersecurity suggests that public-private interactions are
more likely to take the form of **coregulation** for general **standard
setting** or **security certification**]{.underline}. 18 This reflects
in a range of multi-stakeholder governance forums overseen by ENISA,
such as the BENISA Internet infrastructure security and resilience
reference groupB, 19 and the „Electronic Communications Reference Group
(ECRG)B20 These groups interact with other forums for technical
self-regulation, mainly the International Standards Organisation (ISO),
the European Electronic Standards Institute (ETSI, with MoU) and CEN
CELENEC for further industrial standards.21 [ENISA also engages in a
range of wider educational and awareness raising activities that should
stimulate greater cybersecurity investments among both public and
private actors.]{.underline} Aside from a so-called awareness raising
community of ENISA -- which seems to have been discontinued after 2010
-,22 the largest coordinated effort is the so-called cybersecurity
awareness month, which includes various private organisations.23
However, these educations activities cannot be considered as sustained
and substantial PPPs, since its target audience is diffuse and
participants are not expected to enter into more regular relationships
with ENISA. PPPs for information sharing (logical and user layer) For
more substantial PPPs for cybersecurity, one can instead turn to private
forums for sector-specific information sharing and which have contacts
to ENISA. Examples are the so-called European Financial Institutes --
Information Sharing and Analysis Centre 24 (EU-FISAC), or the so-called
European Cyber Security Protection Alliance (CYSPA),25 which united both
business and research institutions. A somewhat confusing array of
additional private initiatives and platforms, such as the Internet
Security Alliance for Europe and the Security Alliance for Europe, also
interact with ENISA and comment on EU policy.26 However, [the main
PPP]{.underline} officially [led by ENISA has been the]{.underline}
so-called BEuropean Public + Private Partnership for Resilience\^ (or
**[E3PR]{.underline}**). This [initiative emerged in the context of a
larger EU policy programme to increase the security of]{.underline}
Critical Information Information infrastructures
(**[CIIP]{.underline}**) \[94\]. [The]{.underline} E3PR [format
generated a number of thematic working and expert groups that should
exchange information on relevant vulnerabilities and define policy
options]{.underline} (compare Farrand and Carrapico in this issue).27
However, [the E3PR **failed** to generate tangible results due to the
diversity of stakeholders and avenues for action that could be
considered before the EU proposed a more **specific legislative
agenda**]{.underline} \[95\]. [Info]{.underline}rmation
[sharing]{.underline} channels for CIIP [issues remained highly
**fragmented** in Europe]{.underline},28 [particularly when aiming to
address the cross-sectoral vulnerabilities of
infrastructures.]{.underline} A [later official evaluation]{.underline}
report [of the E3PR underlined that]{.underline} that [multiple
**conflicts of interests** with regard to the confidentiality of data or
prospect of **costly mandatory security measures** further hampered the
emergence of the desired partnership]{.underline} \[96\]. By 2013, the
EU already debated the aforementioned NIS directive \[52\], which should
extend mandatory information sharing on cybersecurity incidents from
telecommunications providers 29 to other critical infrastructure
providers. Even before the directive has been politically agreed on in
December 2015, ENISA created the socalled NIS platform to succeed the
E3PR. By mid-2015, the NIS platform listed more than 200 members - with
approx. 110 of them representing business interests -,30 and had met at
least five times. This indicates a substantial effort of public-private
networking. Yet the terminological change from a partnership to a
platform for private industry is telling. Rather than promoting regular
operational or administrative cooperation, as we would expect in a
classic PPP, the NIS Platform has worked on a clearer agenda for
co-regulation and related policy options. For these purposes, ENISA
created three working groups, namely on risk management, information
exchange and incident coordination and, finally, secure ICT research and
innovation. Clearly, these tasks may also apply to operational PPPs, but
at the time of writing, the NIS platform has not reached beyond several
conceptual papers that were intended to prepare the implementation of
the upcoming NIS directive. 31 This stakeholder consultation should also
be viewed in wider international processes, as reflected in a recent and
first EU US meeting in that format. 32 In sum, the NIS platform should
mainly be regarded as a supporting process of regulatory governance of
critical infrastructures. Active assistance (logical and user layer) Yet
one point to another area where ENISA may take on a more operational
role for cybersecurity with private actors already, namely via its
support for Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs). CERTs33 have been
developed since 2006 onwards. At the time, a few member states had
started to create such units in emulation of the US, which pioneered
this instrument already in 1990s \[97\]. By 2012, a separate EU CERT has
been created,34 while regular network activities and standardization of
procedures to coordinate the work of national CERTs were underway.35 The
web presence of the EU CERT further includes regular news items on cyber
threats and vulnerabilities of various applications. These CERTs
arguably constitute of boundary case for PPPs as defined for the
purposes of this paper. The leading US model is mainly public
organisation, which maintains close contacts with private business.36
Various national CERTs in Europe clearly have strong ties with the
private sector37 -- or conversely, CERTs of leading IT providers, such
as the German Telecom, maintain close contacts with the public sector,
including the EU level. 38 The EU CERT Mechanism similarly lists various
private companies and internet providers as Bpartners\^ 39 for regular
information sharing. However, [public authorities]{.underline} also
[increasingly seek to provide their own cyber response capacities
**without** having to partner with, or to rely on, private
assistance]{.underline}. 40 For instance, the so-called European
Governmental Cert Group 41 and officially listed partners of the EU-CERT
are purely made up of public authorities,42 while a recent analytical
paper uses the added qualifier of national CSIRTs (nCSIRTs), even if
there remain significant interfaces with private actors \[97\]. So
formalised governance networks can only be made out among public sector
CERTs. This interpretation of CERTs as moving away from PPP should be
tested in further comparative empirical research. In sum, ENISA
expresses strong support for public private partnerships for
cybersecurity, but mainly acts as a facilitator for technical
co-regulation and certification with private actors (at the logical and
infrastructure layer). ENISA organises stakeholder consultations in
relevant EU regulation on cyber and critical infrastructure, as in the
NIS Platform, and supports general awareness raising on cybersecurity
among both public and private actors. Yet [there is limited evidence for
more operational PPPs]{.underline}, as official CERTs increasingly focus
on the specific internal or defensive needs of public actors.

**[The European Union agreed]{.underline}** on Thursday **[to one of the
world's most far-reaching laws to address the power of the biggest tech
companies]{.underline}**, potentially reshaping app stores, online
advertising, e-commerce, messaging services and other everyday digital
tools.

**[The law]{.underline}**, called the Digital Markets Act, **[is the
most sweeping piece of digital policy]{.underline}** **[since the bloc
put the world's toughest rules to protect people's online data into
effect in 2018]{.underline}**. The legislation is aimed at stopping the
largest tech platforms from using their interlocking services and
considerable resources to box in users and squash emerging rivals,
creating room for new entrants and fostering more competition.

What that means practically is that companies like Google will no longer
be able to collect data from different services to offer targeted ads
without users' consent and that Apple may have to allow alternatives to
its App Store on iPhones and iPads. Violators of the law, which will
take effect as early as later this year, could face penalties of up to
20 percent of their global revenue --- which could reach into the tens
of billions of dollars --- for repeat offenses.

**[The Digital Markets Act is part of a one-two punch by European
regulators. As early as next month, the European Union is expected to
reach an agreement on a law that would force social media
companies]{.underline}** such as Meta, the owner of Facebook and
Instagram, **[to police their platforms more
aggressively]{.underline}**.

With these actions, **[Europe is cementing its leadership as the most
assertive regulator of tech companies]{.underline}** such as Apple,
Google, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft. **[European standards are often
adopted worldwide, and the latest legislation further raises the bar by
potentially bringing the companies under a new era of

This comes at a moment when National Defence Technological and
Industrial Bases (**[DTIBs) in Europe have increasingly come under
pressure to produce competitive defence capabilities, due to budgetary
restrictions and defence market forces]{.underline}**. There is no
denying the fact that **[the centre of gravity for security and defence
technology R&D and innovation has shifted from the national and military
levels to the corporate and civilian ones]{.underline}**, because of a
variety of factors, such as economic austerity reasons and the sharp
decline of national defence R&D investment programmes in the post-Cold
War period in Europe. In this regard, the maintenance of a strong EDTIB
was set out to become a top mission for the EDA and the European
Commission, by improving security and defence capabilities, the military
expenditure of member states and by focusing on enhancing European
security via the development of innovative and competitive high-end
technologies.

Political will has been developing in the EU concerning high-tech
security and defence capacity build-up, as demonstrated by the policy
initiatives and strategies recently spearheaded by the EDA and the
European Commission to empower the European defence technology and
innovation sectors. The rapprochement between the EDA and the European
Commission has increased significantly as shown by their combined
efforts to converge national strategic needs and advocate for a more
coherent pan-European common defence policy. The 2016 policy
initiatives, the Implementation Plan on Security and Defence (SDIP) and
the European Commission's European Defence Action Plan (EDAP), are
prefiguring a new practice of collaboration between the EDA and the
Commission to create a stronger European defence market, to revitalise
the European defence industrial base and to encourage member states to
spend more on defence research and emerging technologies. The European
Commission's launch of the Preparatory Action (PA) on CSDP-related
research and in partnership with the EDA as the hub of defence research
is indicative of such moves. The PA is a support programme in the form
of a one-off and of limited duration budget (Crespo 2015), which shifts
financing opportunities for the European defence industries from EU
member states to the EU per se.

The European Commission has proposed the PA back in 2014 for testing the
added-value of CSDP-related research within a permanent EU framework,
outside the limits of the Horizon 2020---The EU Framework Program for
Research Innovation type of civilian or dual-use R&D programmes. At the
time, if proven successful in the time-frame of 2017--2019, the PA was
heralded as a potential game-changer in the field of European defence
research, paving the way for permanent funding from the part of the
European Commission to support CSDP-related research. In an
unprecedented strategic move, it also opened the EU financing machine
for defence technologies research and development beyond the limiting
constraints of civilian or dual-use R&D and Research and Technology
(R&T) under the structural funds such as the Horizon 2020. The European
Defence Fund (EDF), presented in the European Commission's EDAP from 30
November 2016 is case in point, becoming the first supranational
financial tool to directly and exclusively fund cross-border European
defence research projects, with a view to developing innovative and
high-end security technologies.

In light of the above, a clear and resolute direction can be observed,
with conclusive steps taken in strengthening, deepening, and widening
the EU-level defence collaboration. There is no denying the fact that
the European Commission has had an agenda-setting role, taking important
steps to improve efficiency and cooperation in the defence sector: it
increased its efforts to complete the Single Market for defence; it
strengthened the competitiveness of the European industry; and it
bolstered the European defence research by maximising synergies between
civilian and military research (European Commission 2014). These steps
are also achieved through the SDIP and the EDAP, the European Commission
and the EDA working closely together with member states to outline these
initiatives. By taking into account such developments, the chapter
proposes a two-tiered research strategy, by first exploring the
emergence of a European trans-sectoral security field via a new
configuration of power relations and a convergence of interests at the
intersection of different national, supranational and corporate levels
in the case of future-oriented and high-tech research and development.
Second, it examines the role of EU-led innovation and governance of such
technologies in the specific cases of artificial intelligence and
autonomous robotics. The chapter builds on an interpretive methodology
that mobilises qualitative content analysis of various types of textual
data, such as official discourses, key reports, policy documents,
speeches and declarations, press releases, academic research, grey
literature from think tanks and expert evaluations. Consequently, the
chapter investigates the EU's agenda-setter potential as a key driver in
galvanising the European high-tech and defence sectors to bridge the
technological-innovation gap across intergovernmental-supranational,
civil-military and public-private nexuses in Europe to bring about a
'European comprehensive approach' to future and emerging security
technologies. In doing so, it also problematizes the possible
implications of Brexit on the European governance and development of
future and emerging technologies. Finally, it highlights the EU's
efforts in translating technological innovation in these fields into a
potential governance edge and the transformation of the EU into a
technological powerhouse.

**[In February 2022, European Commission]{.underline}** President Ursula
von der Leyen **[announced the]{.underline}** **[European Chips
Act]{.underline}**, **[which adds €15 billion to an existing €30 billion
in public investments to create new STEM-focused programs, attract new
talent to Europe, and build new infrastructure]{.underline}**. These
actions are part of a strategy **[to support]{.underline}** a
**[thriving]{.underline}** **[European semiconductor industry ecosystem,
averting future shortages of semiconductors, and promoting investment
into the European semiconductor industry.]{.underline}**

Through this legislation, **[the Commission hopes to]{.underline}**:
**[Increase EU resilience to supply chain disruptions like those created
by building more domestic capacity]{.underline}**. **[Make Europe a
long-term industrial leader in semiconductors, increasing its global in
manufacturing from 9% to 20% by 2030]{.underline}**.

Areas of Focus: The European Chips Act focuses on five specific areas:

**[Research and Development:]{.underline}** The
**[announcement]{.underline}** by the European Commission President
**[calls for further allocations of funds for research and development
(R&D) to keep up with global competitors]{.underline}**. To augment the
level of research, the Commission will **[further invest €3.3 billion in
two current programs: €1.65 billion to the "Horizon Europe" program and
€1.65 billion to the "Digital Europe" program.]{.underline}** The
\"Horizon Europe\'\' program **[focuses on pre-competitive research,
development, and innovation in the area of semiconductors]{.underline}**
while, "The Digital Europe" program looks to **[make digital domains and
technology widely available for all businesses and the general public to
maximize performance in key industries.]{.underline}**

**["From the lab to the fab": The European Chips Act also calls for more
effectively translating research into industrial innovation and
market-feasible products.]{.underline}** Experts emphasize that Europe
must **[bridge the gap between excellence in laboratory research and
onshore manufacturing to sustain leadership in
semiconductors]{.underline}** and other advanced technologies.

**[Industry Production:]{.underline}** The **[European Chips Act
recognizes that advanced production facilities come with huge up-front
costs. Europe is looking to host "first of its kind" facilities through
the creation of Integrated Production Facilities, which are factories
that design and produce semiconductor components that serve the European
market and through Open EU Foundries for chip design]{.underline}**,
which are facilities that design and produce components for other
industrial actors such as medical devices and computer programming. The
EU Commission sees Europe lagging in chip production, so **[if the EU
can accomplish building these Integrated Production Facilities and Open
EU foundries, the]{.underline}** EU commission **[goal of]{.underline}**
increasing European chip production from **[9% to 20% of global
production by 2030 becomes significantly more reachable.]{.underline}**

**[Local Support:]{.underline}** **[European policymakers see the need
to support the local skill base and the network of smaller, innovative
companies and start-ups as a part of their strategy to grow their
semiconductor and high technology ecosystems]{.underline}**. To do this,
the **[European Commission has established the "EU Chips Fund" which
will contribute €2 billion to create a more competitive market for
semiconductor start-ups to participate in and address skill
shortages]{.underline}**. **[Additionally]{.underline}**, the Commission
wants to help **[in the retention of employees]{.underline}** that have
the skills that these start-ups need to be successful and to find
industrial partners for these start-ups to collaborate with.

**[Overhaul the European Supply Chain:]{.underline}** **[The strategy
also seeks to advance the European Union's supply chain]{.underline}**.
Within the EU, the Commission wants to **[encourage Member States and
industry stakeholders to coordinate efforts towards an improved European
supply chain for semiconductors]{.underline}**.. **[To enable a rapid
response to the current shortages]{.underline}**, the Commission has
created a list of recommendations to the Member States. **[Along with
streamlining policies of member states, Europe is also looking to build
partnerships with the United States and other nations to create a more
resilient global semiconductor network.]{.underline}**

NATO and the European Union. **[The strength of the transatlantic
alliance revolves around the axis of NATO, which has done more to
promote democracy, peace, and security in Europe than any other
alliance---including the European Union]{.underline}**---since its
inception in 1949. Far from being outmoded, **[NATO today is more
relevant and crucial for maintaining transatlantic security than it has
been since the end of the Cold War. While some in Brussels and across
the halls of power in Europe may have dreams of an independent EU Army
or an independent EU defensive apparatus capable of replacing NATO and
the U.S. military, true EU "strategic autonomy" in defense is a
chimera]{.underline}**.

**[The EU will never be able to provide the peace and stability that
NATO]{.underline}**--- with feet firmly rooted in both North America and
Europe for the past 70 years---**[has delivered, and will continue to
deliver. While EU-led defense initiatives may be able to provide some
defense improvements at the margins, the outsized costs include
decisions that enervate NATO, exacerbate existing fractures within
Europe, and severely stress the transatlantic link.]{.underline}**

NATO's reflection should approach further NATO--EU initiatives
cautiously. **[While the EU undoubtedly maintains competencies that will
be necessary and useful for responding to the challenges associated with
a return to great power competition, the EU cannot fulfill the security
role in Europe currently performed by the U.S. and NATO. For peace and
security, it is essential that NATO maintain its keystone role in
European defense policy. This means firmly pushing back against EU
defense integration efforts that are not in the interests of the
Alliance.]{.underline}**

When it comes to EU strategic autonomy, **[NATO should insist
that]{.underline}** former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's
**["3Ds" continue to be respected---(1) no decoupling of U.S. security
from European security, (2) no duplication of structures or initiatives
that already exist within NATO, and (3) no discrimination against non-EU

**[The stakes are high. If]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}**

--]{.underline}** exemplified by the absence of a coordinated global
response to the COVID-19 pandemic **[-- will continue]{.underline}**.
Even the diplomatic muscle memory that has enabled the limited recent
examples of cooperation will fade.

**[Why shouldn't someone else lead?]{.underline}** Simply put,
**[because no one else can]{.underline}**. **[There is no single
actor]{.underline}**, **[or even a collection of actors, that is ready

attributes]{.underline}** of an exemplar: **[vibrant and diverse
cultures, dynamic civil societies, well-institutionalized systems for
upholding human rights and the rule of law, and a commitment to
multilateralism.]{.underline}**

And **[yet, in many areas vital to global leadership]{.underline}**,
**[the EU falters]{.underline}**. **[A lack of political will has
meant]{.underline}** **[that Europe has consistently misallocated
resources]{.underline}**. **[As a result, it has failed to build up
adequate shared capacity]{.underline}** **[or even to create the
conditions for doing so]{.underline}**. For example, **[EU leaders
insist that Europe needs to achieve "strategic autonomy," without
agreement on what that means.]{.underline}**

More fundamentally, **[the EU lacks the self-assurance it would need to
serve as a credible and compelling]{.underline}** **[example for the
world. To change that, it must first define and convey a compelling
raison d'être,]{.underline}** which can form the basis of its own
revitalized model. **[It must then dedicate significant
resources]{.underline}** -- **[time]{.underline}**,
**[effort]{.underline}**, and **[money]{.underline}** -- **[to building
the capacity and status needed to project its influence]{.underline}**.
In short, the EU must walk the walk.1

Unless and until it does, **[the US will be indispensable, because it is
irreplaceable. That makes it all the more important for the Biden
administration]{.underline}** not only **[to re-engage with the world
and]{.underline}** **[the multilateral system]{.underline}** **[as a

**[Anarchy has not come to Africa]{.underline}** -- **[at least not in
the expanding, all-encompassing way meant by the pessimists of a decade
or two ago]{.underline}**. The continent is far from uniformly peaceful,
and current outbreaks of violence are reminders of the need for more
progress. On the whole, however, **[Africa is less war-torn than at any
time in the past, which runs contrary to widespread perceptions that
exist even among foreign policy experts]{.underline}**. Kaplan remains
unchanged, claiming recently that his most important predictions have
actually been borne out.95 However, **[the evidence suggests that
despite neo-Malthusians fears, by most measures life on the continent is
improving. War is becoming less of a threat to the life of the average
African than emerging middleincome threats like traffic accidents or
diabetes.]{.underline}** Nor have realist fears of predatory wars and
wholesale remaking of the map of Africa come to pass. That is not meant
to dismiss the suffering of residents of the Central African Republic,
South Sudan or northern Nigeria, nor to suggest that all is well.
The**[re are hundreds of millions of Africans who do not face as great a
threat of armed conflict]{.underline}** as they once did, however. It is
important to see Africa as more than 50 distinct countries, some -- and
by historical standards, relatively few -- of which are beset by
warfare, even if they continue to face other, even greater challenges.
Nothing guarantees that these trends will continue. Indeed, several
require active maintenance. **[If the outside world stops responding to
African hotspots, at least with diplomatic resources and avoiding
support to plunder-financed armed groups, conflict becomes more
likely.]{.underline}** Intense American --Chinese competition could
encourage internal conflict or spur vicious circles of tension between
neighbours. **[The United Nations, former colonizers and AFRICOM have
all been useful in helping to bring stability to the continent, but
their long-term interest is hardly assured.]{.underline}** A global
recession or a wave of protectionism could dash optimism about economic
growth. But for now, for the first time in quite some time, **[there is
reason for optimism about the decline of warfare in
Africa]{.underline}**. What the United States and other outsiders should
not do, however, is continue to look at Africa though a lens that
overemphasizes conflict and a few crisis-afflicted nations. Additional
American support for African peacekeeping capability is welcome, but an
increase in American investment in African economies would do even more
good for more people. Policymakers should emphasize to the business
community how much is now going right in Africa. The Obama
Administration has taken useful steps in that direction, but at other
times shows signs of the 'Africa-as-Anarchy' mindset. Programmes to help
African governments build capacity outside the military-security sphere
could be expanded, such as police and judicial systems, or the
infrastructure and service delivery needs of large cities in which a
growing share of Africans live. Africa faces many problems. **[Peace
does not necessarily bring freedom, justice, or prosperity. But today a
far greater percentage of people on the continent live without serious
risk of dying due to warfare than pessimists expected.]{.underline}** On
the contrary, 'end of war' optimists may prove to be right about Africa
too, if on a slower time scale than most of the world. Perhaps a rising
generation of leaders and citizens are being influenced by both global
norms and expectations of greater opportunities. Africa is surely the
hardest test of the global trend away from international conflict. If
conflict can no longer find a home there, will it be welcome anywhere?

**[\"Latin America is violent]{.underline}** and dangerous.\" Yes,
**[but not unstable]{.underline}**. Latin American countries have among
the world\'s highest rates of crime, murder, and kidnapping. Pockets of
abnormal levels of violence have emerged in countries such as Colombia
\-- and more recently, in Mexico, Central America, and some large cities
such as Caracas. With 140,000 homicides in 2010, it is understandable
how Latin America got this reputation. Each of the countries in Central
America\'s \"Northern Triangle\" (Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador)
had more murders in 2010 than the entire European Union combined.
Violence in Latin America is strongly related to poverty and inequality.
When combined with the insatiable international appetite for the illegal
drugs produced in the region, it\'s a noxious brew. As strongly argued
by a number of prominent regional leaders \-- including Brazil\'s former
president, Fernando H. Cardoso, and Colombia\'s former president, Cesar
Gaviria \-- a strategy based on demand reduction, rather than supply, is
the only way to reduce crime in Latin America. **[Although some fear the
Mexican drug violence could spill over into the southern United States,
Latin America poses little to no threat to international peace or
stability. The major global security concerns today are the
proliferation of nuclear weapons and terrorism. No country in the region
is in possession of nuclear weapons \-- nor has expressed an interest in
having them. Latin American countries]{.underline}**, on the whole,
**[do not have much history of engaging in cross-border wars. Despite
the recent tensions on the Venezuela-Colombia border, it should be
pointed out that Venezuela has never taken part in an international
armed conflict]{.underline}**. **[Ethnic and religious conflicts are
very uncommon]{.underline}** in Latin America. Although the region has
not been immune to radical jihadist attacks \-- the 1994 attack on a
Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, for instance \-- they have been

**[Is a new Cold War looming]{.underline}** --- or already present ---
**[between the United States and China?]{.underline}** Many analysts
argue that a combination of geopolitics, ideology and competing visions
of "global order" are driving the two countries toward emulating the
Soviet-U.S. rivalry that dominated world politics from 1947 through
1990. But such **[concerns are overblown]{.underline}**. **[Here are
four big reasons]{.underline}** why**[. 1. The historical backdrops of
the two relationships are very different]{.underline}** When the Cold
War began, the U.S.-Soviet relationship was fragile and tenuous.
Bilateral diplomatic relations were barely a decade old, U.S.
intervention in the Russian Revolution was a recent memory, and the
Soviet Union had called for the overthrow of capitalist governments into
the 1940s. Despite their Grand Alliance against Nazi Germany, the two
countries shared few meaningful diplomatic, economic or institutional
links. **[In 2019]{.underline}**, the situation between the United
States and China is very different. Since the 1970s, **[diplomatic
interactions, institutional ties and economic flows have all exploded.
Although each side has criticized the other for domestic
interference]{.underline}** (such as U.S. demands for journalist access
to Tibet and China's espionage against U.S. corporations), **[these
issues did not prevent cooperation on]{.underline}** a host of **[other
issues.]{.underline}** Yes, there were **[tensions]{.underline}** over
the past decade, but these **[occurred against a generally cooperative
backdrop. 2. Geography and powers' nuclear postures suggest East Asia is
more stable than Cold War-era Europe]{.underline}** The Cold War was
shaped by an intense arms race, nuclear posturing and crises, especially
in continental Europe. Given Europe's political geography, the United
States feared a "bolt from the blue" attack would allow the Soviet Union
to conquer the continent. Accordingly, the United States prepared to
defend Europe with conventional forces, and to deter Soviet
aggrandizement using nuclear weapons. Unsurprisingly, the Soviet Union
also feared that the United States might attack and wanted to deter U.S.
adventurism. Concerns that the other superpower might use force and that
crises could quickly escalate colored Cold War politics. **[Today, the
United States and China spend proportionally far less on their
militaries than the United States and the Soviet Union
did.]{.underline}** Though an arms race may be emerging, U.S. and
Chinese **[nuclear postures are not]{.underline}** nearly **[as large or
threatening: Arsenals]{.underline}** remain far below the size and scope
witnessed in the Cold War, and **[are kept at a lower state of
alert.]{.underline}** As for geography, **[East Asia is not primed for
tensions]{.underline}** akin to those in Cold War Europe**[. China can
threaten]{.underline}** to coerce **[its neighbors, but]{.underline}**
the **[water barriers]{.underline}** **[separating China
from]{.underline}** most of **[Asia's strategically important states
make outright conquest significantly harder.]{.underline}** Of course,
as scholars such as Caitlin Talmadge and Avery Goldstein note, crises
may still erupt, and each side may face pressures to escalate. **[Unlike
the Cold War,]{.underline}** however, **[U.S.-Chinese confrontations
occur at sea with]{.underline}** relatively **[limited forces and
without clear territorial boundaries.]{.underline}** This suggests
**[there are countervailing factors that may give the two sides room to
negotiate --- and limit the speed with which a crisis
unfolds]{.underline}**. **[3. The Cold War had just two major
powers]{.underline}** The Cold War took place in a bipolar system, with
the United States and Soviet Union uniquely powerful, compared with
other nations. This dynamic often pushed the United States and the
U.S.S.R. toward confrontation and contributed to more or less fixed
alliances; moreover, it encouraged efforts to suppress prospective great
powers, such as Germany. In 2019, it's not at all clear we are back to
bipolarity. Analysts remain divided over whether the U.S. unipolar era
is waning (or is already over) --- and, if so, whether we are heading
for a new period of bipolarity, modern-day multipolarity or something
else. Regardless, most analysts accept that **[other countries will play
a central role in East Asian security affairs.]{.underline}** Russia,
for example, still benefits from legacy military investments, India is
developing economically and militarily, and Japan is beginning to build
highly capable military forces to complement its still-significant
economic might. Even if these nations aren't as powerful as the United
States or China, their presence makes for more fluid diplomatic
arrangements and more diffuse security concerns than during the
U.S.-Soviet competition. The resulting security dynamics are therefore
likely to look very different. **[4. Ideology plays less of a role in
U.S.-Chinese relations Many people see the Cold War as an ideological
contest between U.S.-backed liberalism and Soviet-backed
communism.]{.underline}** But that's not the whole story. The early 20th
century saw liberalism, communism and fascism vie for ideological
preeminence. With fascism defeated alongside Nazi Germany, the postwar
stage was set for a struggle between communism and liberalism to
reinforce the U.S.-Soviet contest. That each ideology claimed universal
scope ensured that the ideologies served as rallying cries for Third
World conflicts, which were subsequently associated with the U.S.-Soviet
struggle. **[The respective "ideologies" of the United States and China
do not favor this type of contest today.]{.underline}** Indeed,
**[analysts calling for a hard-line stance]{.underline}** against China
have **[faced difficulties]{.underline}** even **[identifying a coherent
Chinese ideological alternative.]{.underline}** And while some
researchers **[claim that a nascent ideological contest pitting an
"autocratic" China against the "liberal" United States]{.underline}** is
emerging, this narrative **[ignores the political contests that shape
Chinese politics]{.underline}** (and have parallels in U.S.
politics)**[. Autocracies and democracies often
cooperate]{.underline}**. And **[on one important ideological
issue]{.underline}** --- **[how they organize their economic
lives]{.underline}** --- **[China and the United States have both
embraced economic growth via trade, the private sector and semi-free
markets]{.underline}**.

Since 2009, **[the EU appears to]{.underline}** be
**[operat]{.underline}**ing **[in a context of permanent crises.
Internally, it is grappling with the crisis of the
Eurozone]{.underline}** and economic governance, **[the migration
crisis]{.underline}**, the negotiations surrounding
**[Brexit]{.underline}**, and **[a creeping]{.underline}** but no less
dangerous **[challenge to democracy as the core of the Union's shared
values.]{.underline}** The manifestations of these crises have been so
prolonged and recurring that they raise the question whether **[they
represent systemic flaws that call into question the long-term prospects
of European integration]{.underline}**. This question has been posed
with relation to European economic and eurozone governance, but is
**[equally relevant when it comes to Eurosceptic trends among EU
citizens and the rise of populist and nationalist governments that
explicitly challenge core institutions and values of the
Union]{.underline}**. Brexit negotiations and the enduring difficulties
in finding a workable form of future cooperation with the UK after the
deadline for leaving the Union further illustrate how some of the core
tenets of the EU's order, including the free movement of people in the
internal market, are coming under pressure. At the same time, **[the EU
faces a multitude of external challenges. These range from the strained
transatlantic relationship due to the increasingly isolationist stance
of the United States, the rise of a stronger China, and an increasingly
assertive Russia. The EU's ability to bring positive change to its
neighbourhood is challenged by the enduring instability and outright
political crises in the countries of the Eastern Partnership and those
that experienced the Arab Spring. These multiple crises challenge the
EU's emphasis on soft power as its privileged mode of engagement with
third countries and risk fostering ever deeper Euroscepticism among the
EU's citizens.]{.underline}**
