[[U.S. s]{.mark}ecurity [a]{.mark}ssistance [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
broken and [[in need of]{.mark} an [overhaul]{.mark}]{.underline}. Over
the past two decades, [[the bureaucratic system]{.mark} developed to
deliver billions]{.underline} of dollars of military aid to partner
nations [[has]{.mark} evolved and [expanded]{.mark} not by design but
[as the result of a series of ad hoc legislative]{.mark} and policy
[changes. Though]{.mark}]{.underline} the U.S. Department of [[State was
initially in charge]{.underline}]{.mark} of security assistance policy
and accounts, [[since 9/11, the]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. Department of
Defense ([[DOD) has established a separate, well-funded security
assistance bureaucracy at the Pentagon. This has **inhibited effective
congressional oversight, harmed coordination**]{.underline}]{.mark}
between diplomacy and defense, **[[and contributed
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the growing militarization of U.S. foreign
policy. It has created **[[a dysfunctional]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
bifurcated **[[security assistance system]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While
it continues to control funding for its many Title 22 programs, they are
largely executed via DSCA and the MILDEPs. Although Congress has
recognized that it has, in effect, created the basis for confusion via
the two departments' dual congressionally mandated authorities and
authorizations, a political decision to create a clear lead agent for
these activities remains missing. One will return to the U.S.
Government's well-used practice of "fudging" when it comes to
identifying who's in charge.

### 2nc Complexity 

**Dozens of agencies with overlapping and conflicting authorities ensure
SC failure**

[In terms of SC and SA, the proverbial elephant in the room is
DOD]{.underline}. But this has not always been the case. This is one of
[the]{.underline} externalities of the George W. Bush administration's
[response to the global war on terror]{.underline}; at the time, DOD
found that existing U.S. training and particularly equipping programs
funded by the Department of State's appropriations and authorizations
(Title 22, U.S. Code) simply were insufficiently responsive and nimble
to meet operational commanders' requirements. [Congress responded to
DOD's entreaties for more authority]{.underline} to build partner forces
in the FY 2006 NDAA, which authorized DOD (with the concurrence of the
Secretary of State) to use its authorizations and appropriations (Title
10, U.S. Code) to build capabilities and capacity in partner armed
forces in order to conduct counterterrorism operations.
[The]{.underline} perhaps predictable, if not inevitable, [result of DOD
rapidly trying to create capacity within partner armed forces was an
embarrassing lack of attention paid to the financial niceties and
details that are of great importance to Congress]{.underline}. As a RAND
report observed, "DOD lacks the detailed financial data necessary to
respond to new congressional reporting requirements. Moreover, DOD
leaders are unable to compare SC spending across countries, regions, and
programs, which is critical to future prioritization and resourcing
decisions."10 Perhaps it is inaccurate to characterize DOD as an
elephant (in any room); in reality, it is more like a herd of
independently minded creatures. [Title 10 makes it clear that the
individual MILDEPs exist in splendid political if not geographical
isolation from each other]{.underline}, let alone from the Office of the
Secretary of Defense. The MILDEPs' Major Force Programs reflect the
clear objective of Congress that the former retain a high degree of
autonomy from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, notwithstanding
largely ignored verbiage in the law that explicitly states in the
preamble to the three departments' sections that the exercise of their
functions are "subject to the authority, direction, and control of the
Secretary of Defense."11 The record demonstrates that the intent of
Congress's annual appropriations and authorizations easily trumps this
provision of the law. The canonical source of the MILDEPs' autonomy is
found in the 12 roles and missions assigned to them in Title 10.12 It is
the particular authority of training under which the MILDEPs' authority
to conduct SC and SA reside (for example, continental U.S.-based
professional military education and all forms of training). Other key
players in the planning and execution of these programs include the
Office of the Secretary of Defense, which provides policy guidance and
priorities; DSCA, with its newly enhanced powers granted to it via the
FY 2017 NDAA (discussed below); the combatant commands, which act as
planners and coordinators of these activities (under the authority of
the Unified Command Plan); the Service components that execute many of
the in-country training events; and finally, as extensions of the
combatant commands, defense cooperation offices resident in-country that
manage and direct both training programs and equipment transfers.
**[Given the number of stakeholders, the politics of agreeing
priorities, approaches, timing, scope, and so forth, the execution of SC
and SA activities can be frightfully untidy.]{.underline}**

#### Security Cooperation fails (not with agenda DA)

**Tankel and Rand 15**, Rand is the former deputy director of Studies
and Leon E. Panetta fellow at the Center for a New American Security.
Tankel is an assistant professor at the School of International Service
at American University ("Security assistance isn't the quick fix the US
thinks it is," The Hill,
https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/250348-security-assistance-isnt-the-quick-fix-the-us-thinks-it-is/amp/)

As we argue in a report recently released by the Center for a New
American Security, Security Cooperation and Assistance: Rethinking the
Return on Investment, part of the problem is that BPC has become a
catchall for wide array of security assistance and cooperation programs,
only some of which actually pertain to enhancing the capabilities and
capacity of a partner's military and civilian institutions. [There are
**myriad** challenges to deploying]{.underline} assistance and
[cooperation effectively]{.underline}. Recent events in Syria only
scratch the surface. [Security]{.underline} assistance and [cooperation
has been a critical pillar of U.S. statecraft for decades]{.underline}.
The post-9/11 interest in using assistance and cooperation to
incentivize and enable local partners contributed to the creation of a
slew of new authorities and programs. [Yet]{.underline}, despite its
strategic centrality and large price tag, our report argues that many
[security]{.underline} assistance and [cooperation programs fail to
achieve U.S. objectives because of **strategic and structural
deficiencies**]{.underline}. Strategically, U.S. policymakers are often
not clear about the specific outcomes they intend to achieve with
security assistance and cooperation. Even when objectives are clear,
there may be too many of them for a single program, which results in
conflicting objectives. This is especially troublesome when pressing,
short-term objectives subvert long-term U.S. goals. Also, [there is
currently no system in place to adequately assess outcomes]{.underline}.
This not only risks wasting taxpayers' dollars. [Failure to assess
progress and adjust programs accordingly can actually reduce U.S.
influence with recipient states]{.underline}, which may believe they can
free-ride or begin to view assistance as an entitlement. The practice of
using security assistance to build relationships sometimes contributes
to this problem. So does the fact that policymakers too often look to
security assistance as a quick fix or way to address demands to "do
something." [Yet]{.underline}, [security]{.underline} assistance and
[cooperation remains]{.underline} vitally important and is
[appealing]{.underline}, especially when options like large-scale U.S.
military operations do not make strategic sense. [This helps to explain
the numerous new authorities that consecutive administrations have
requested and Congress has created. The increase in new authorities has
contributed to confusion about the purposes of different
programs]{.underline}. Moreover, programs are sometimes chosen based on
which authorities are available or most flexible rather than on the
authority best suited to the task at hand. Finally, most of the new
[programs are housed at the Pentagon and not the State
Department]{.underline}. [As a result, programs are deployed to meet
Defense requirements as opposed to implemented in a way that furthers
broader foreign policy objective]{.underline}s. **[The bottom line is
that more is not]{.underline}** necessarily **[better]{.underline}**.
[That goes for the number of authorities and the level of]{.underline}
assistance or [cooperation provided to U.S. partners]{.underline}. [The
spate of new authorities has exacerbated both imbalances between the
Pentagon and the State Department and conflicts among the objectives
that]{.underline} assistance and [cooperation are used to
achieve]{.underline}.

Security Assistance: Why the State Department Can\'t Lead from Behind",
<https://www.rand.org/blog/2018/09/reforming-security-assistance-why-the-state-department.html>)LR

[The goal is to make the world safer and advance U.S. security
interests. But is it working? For the most part, we don\'t
know.]{.underline} Studies by the RAND Corporation have found evidence
of potentially powerful returns on investment but also significant
risks. [Skeptics can point to many horror stories about American
military equipment rotting in storage depots or being misused and
U.S.-trained officers becoming dictators, coup plotters and human rights
abusers.]{.underline} The State Department has oversight for all foreign
assistance, including security assistance. Since 9/11, however,
[Congress has given the Pentagon significant increases in funding and
authorities to cooperate with security forces around the
world.]{.underline} If Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and [**members of
Congress don\'t take steps toward reform, State may find it increasingly
difficult to maintain this important leadership role**.]{.underline}
State\'s first challenge is the tangle of legislative authorities and
stove-piped appropriations that drive U.S. security assistance. The U.S.
spent roughly \$42 billion in 2017 on foreign assistance, including \$17
billion in security assistance. America\'s flagship security assistance
program is Foreign Military Financing (FMF), which provided almost \$6
billion in military equipment and services to foreign partners last
year. But State oversees many other security assistance accounts to
support military education, peacekeeping, counterterrorism and other
efforts. [Several of the laws that authorize these programs are
outdated, disjointed and inhibit agility and long-term planning. A
review of security assistance authorities could go a long way toward
clarifying congressional priorities and expectations in an international
security environment that grows increasingly complex.]{.underline} For
example, rather than reform the 42-year-old law that prohibits security
assistance to foreign law enforcement, Congress simply provides a steady
stream of waivers and exemptions, to the tune of about \$2 billion
annually. To what extent does Congress want the State Department to
strengthen foreign police forces, border security officers,
counterterrorism units and counter-narcotics investigators? What
priorities and restrictions do they desire on this assistance? It\'s
hard to say. RAND\'s 2016 report, From Patchwork to Framework: A Review
of Title 10 Authorities for Security Cooperation, [identified similar
problems for the Department of Defense (DoD), analyzing a convoluted
patchwork of over 100 DoD authorities, many of which had been created or
strengthened in the wake of 9/11. In 2017, Congress consolidated and
reformed many of these authorities and created new reporting
requirements to improve DoD\'s assessments of what\'s really required,
monitoring of progress and evaluation of outcomes]{.underline}. Defense
has greater authority now to re-prioritize resources from one country to
another or one activity to another as it deems appropriate. [In exchange
for that flexibility, DoD has the responsibility to report more clearly
on what\'s working and what\'s not. The State Department\'s second
challenge involves planning.]{.underline} For example, FMF funding is
allocated to individual partner nations, who tell the U.S. what
equipment and services they would like, and U.S. officials decide
whether to approve the request. Parallel discussions take place among
different officials about peacekeeping, counter-narcotics,
counterterrorism and other programs, each with its own planning
processes and congressional reporting requirements. [While there is
certainly coordination along the way, there is often a transactional,
disjointed feel to the process.]{.underline}

out State Dept. on foreign aid"
https://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/general-diplomats-tussle-over-pentagons-growing-military-aid-portfolio-221177)LR

"During the course of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars in particular ---
and then more recently related to Iraq and Syria [--- there has been
this steady accumulation of very specific authorities that have largely
gone over to the Department of Defense]{.underline}," the former Air
Force officer and special assistant to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff said in an interview. But now that large-scale combat in Iraq
and Afghanistan has diminished, ["It's a fair question to ask, 'Do we
have the balance right between State and DoD?'"]{.underline} For
decades, the [power largely rested with the State Department, which is
responsible for setting and implementing foreign policy.]{.underline} It
has traditionally [played the lead role in deciding who should get U.S.
security assistance]{.underline} and has asserted its authority to
squelch military proposals it considers unwise, officials said. Last
year, the [department vetoed a Pentagon plan to train snipers from
Belarus, which has no free elections and where political dissidents
continue to disappear with no government explanation]{.underline}. State
also recently scuttled a plan to provide lip balm and brooms to the
Jordanian military --- items the department deemed wasteful. The Defense
Department, though, increasingly has dollars on its side. [The
Pentagon's budget for such overseas military aid has more than tripled
from 2008 to 2015, compared with just 23 percent growth for the State
Depart]{.underline}ment, according to internal administration data
provided to POLITICO. "[You are going to see disagreement any time DoD
is proposing a change of program in a way that the State Department
would perceive as diminishing the degree of coordination that is
required]{.underline}," said a [senior administration official directly
involved in the internal deliberations.]{.underline} Even without a
change in the law, though, the State Department has found itself
virtually shut out of the review process in some cases, according to
interviews with current and former department officials. For example,
[the diplomats recently learned the Pentagon was funding
counter-narcotics operations in several nations in Central Asia that the
State Department had previously deemed ineligible for military
assistance]{.underline}. State also learned from media reports that the
Pentagon was training a controversial Cambodian army general[. And
despite efforts to better coordinate the two departments' activities,
confusion remains about who is doing what. One consequence: The Pentagon
has a program underway to provide \$100 million worth of new helicopters
to the Kenyan military, while State has separately pursued efforts to
supply it with used helicopters.]{.underline} The State Department isn't
concerned solely about human rights and the aid recipients'
international behavior. Its supporters also argue that the State
Department is better positioned than the military to manage the programs
long-term. "[There is no sustainment process with DoD," said another
administration official involved in the policy debate. "Ships we have
provided are rusting pierside."]{.underline} A recent analysis by the
Congressional Research Service also concluded that [recent policy
decisions "have combined to slowly muddle the clear legal separation
between State and DoD]{.underline} roles." A March 9 analysis by the
government-funded Rand Corp. similarly called for reviewing the two
departments' "roles, interests and coordination processes." "[This trend
of giving more and more authority and taking them away from State is not
a great thing,"]{.underline} said Ilan Goldenberg, who runs the Middle
East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. **["It
is largely a function that in Congress DoD gets a lot more attention and
has a lot more leverage."]{.underline}**

### 2nc Complexity -- Recipient Countries

#### Recipient countries fail to understand the complexity of US bureaucracy

**Arnold 20**, colonel in USAF (Jason, "Add Value to Security
Cooperation through Joint Unification," FAO Journal of International
Affairs,
https://faoajournal.substack.com/p/add-value-to-security-cooperation?s=r)

[In]{.underline} the [Security Cooperation]{.underline} Enterprise, [the
military departments loom large as the]{.underline} primary
[implementing agencies of]{.underline} Foreign Military Sales
([FMS]{.underline}) cases, Building Partner Capacity ([BPC]{.underline})
cases, [and]{.underline} in [training]{.underline} activities.\[6\]
These SC programs provide our international partners with the
capabilities they require both for their own security and to assist in
regional security objectives that improve the overall global security
situation. Most open [SC cases have one of the military departments as
an Implementing Agency]{.underline} (IA) [and each service has built its
own organizational structure, bureaucracy, and automated systems to
support the effort]{.underline}.\[7\] Over the decades, a familiar
dynamic has taken place. The [military departments]{.underline} have
[develop]{.underline}ed their own [implementing processes in an insular
way, isolated from the other branches, and accommodating their own
unique business rules, methods, and systems separate from the
others]{.underline}. In addition to contributing to the already
significant complexity of the SC Enterprise, [the familiar replication
of effort, **divergent doctrine and** **practice**, and **inefficient
use of resources** is again evident]{.underline}. Still, the Services
continue to diverge. [Consider the difficulties these differing systems
place on our international partners. Friendly foreign nations, committed
to working toward our mutual security interests, must not only
understand the various roles and processes in the general realm of SC,
but also must learn the complexities of several **different systems**,
depending on the implementing agency]{.underline} for a particular
program. Indeed, [this complexity is one of the primary complaints of
the SC processes from our partners]{.underline}. [Perhaps the complexity
would be justified if it added value, but]{.underline} in almost all
cases, the [different processes]{.underline} add no greater benefit, but
[are due simply to the fact that they were developed in isolation by
different organizations]{.underline}. Integrated processes and systems
that are standardized across the implementing agencies would be a vast
improvement, providing increased transparency, reduced complexity, and
greater effectiveness across the board. Security Cooperation is
inherently an interagency process, and requires a whole of government
effort. Presidential Policy Directive 23 identified the Department of
State (DoS) as the lead agency for United States Security Sector
Assistance Policy, and all Security Assistance and Security Cooperation
efforts require coordination and consent across agencies. The
interagency process can be hampered by the diversity of processes and
players that are presented by the separate Services' SC organizations.
It is not only our [international partners]{.underline} that [struggle
with learning the different ways and means of]{.underline} the
**[various implementing agencies]{.underline}**, our own interagency
partners can experience confusion as well in navigating the various
systems, doctrine, and processes.

[There is still much work to be done to overcome security cooperation
obstacles]{.underline} and properly create a force that is fully ready
for strategic competition and ideally postured for integrated
deterrence. [**First**, onerous security barriers hinder progress in
interoperability and integration, creating operational risk to avoid
minor technical risk]{.underline}. When making exportability rulings,
[decision-makers too heavily and strictly consider security risk or
concerns about technological exploitation, preventing the export of U.S.
weapons systems without]{.underline} a proper [consideration for the
operational necessity of offering that capability to allies and partners
in order to share burdens and develop interoperability. As a result, in
the name of maintaining a unilateral technological advantage,
bureaucrats pass on operational risk]{.underline} to combatant
commanders and warfighters who expect to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with
fully-capable allies and partners. [**Second**, exportability of
combat-relevant systems remains an afterthought of the acquisition
process]{.underline}. Though American policy directs that new systems be
designed for exportability, waivers to this policy are liberally applied
and commonplace. [**Finally**, slow security cooperation processes often
deliver certain systems late-to-need]{.underline}, in part [because of
plodding security-focused decision-making mechanisms that are a part of
exportability rulings. **Delayed delivery schedules** create a

## Mission Objectives

### 1nc US Lacks Influence

**US dearth of influence keeps partner countries' ill equipt --
corruption**

**Tecott 21**, PhD in Political Science @ MIT (Rachel, "The Cult of the
Persuasive: The U.S. Military's Aversion to Coercion in Security
Assistance," Proquest Dissertations)

Security assistance has been a central dimension of U.S. foreign policy
and military strategy since World War II and has emerged today a pillar
of the United States' touted return to great power competition.4 [The
United States intends security assistance to improve the capacity of
partner militaries to manage local security threats, freeing the U.S.
military to shift its weight to China and Russia]{.underline}. Though
the core of U.S. military planning remains preparation for war, [the
vast majority of what the U.S. military is actually doing outside of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates on a given day [is some form of
cooperation to build stronger partners]{.underline}. Between 1999 and
2016, the United States trained some 2,390,080 trainees from virtually
every country in the world.5 In February 2018, the first U.S. Security
Force Assistance Brigade (SFAB) was born, institutionalizing security
assistance as an enduring, core competency of the U.S. Army.6 And the
United States is not the only player in the game. The United States
encourages its allies to strengthen the militaries in their own
backyards, and eyes the People's Liberation Army warily as it trains and
equips soldiers around the world.7 The trouble is, though, that security
assistance does not actually seem to work all that well.8 Few of the
militaries the United States tried to build demonstrated any clear
improvement. Start FN 9 U.S. efforts to build the Hellenic Army in
Greece and the Republic of Korea Army are widely recognized as rare
examples of clear success stories for U.S. security assistance. The
three largest-scale security assistance efforts in U.S.
history---Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq---are broadly understood as
abject failures. Most smaller scale security assistance efforts have
escaped systematic evaluation. End FN 9 Despite the emergence of
security assistance as a foundation of United States foreign policy and
a ubiquitous feature of international relations, few scholars have
examined how the United States goes about building partner militaries,
the relative effectiveness of varying approaches, or the forces shaping
U.S strategy. 10 This study takes on these questions. Security
assistance is tricky for reasons familiar to students of military
effectiveness. After a certain resource threshold is met, military
[effectiveness depends largely on military organizational
practices]{.underline} around personnel, command structures, training,
and resource allocation.11 [Local political and military
leaders]{.underline} are not always interested in building militaries
that can fight, and may instead [implement policies optimized to
coup-proofing, consolidating political power, or **lining their own
pockets**]{.underline}.12 [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[tends to provide the most assistance to]{.underline} nations that need
it most desperately---[nations whose leaders are often less motivated to
build them in the first place]{.underline}.13 [These leaders may welcome
huge infusions of cash, equipment, and assistance from the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [while simultaneously ignoring
U.S. advice and implementing policies that keep their militaries
weak]{.underline}. Fundamentally, then, the core challenge of security
assistance is influence. [The success or failure of]{.underline}
large-scale U.S. security [assistance]{.underline} projects [depends
less on the amount of assistance]{.underline} the U.S. pours into
recipient [nations than on the decisions of recipient
leaders]{.underline} about what to do with U.S. assistance. **[The
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[builds better
militaries when it successfully influences recipient leaders---it fails
when U.S. influence fails. U.S. influence fails a lot.]{.underline}**

### 1nc Technicism/Militarism Focus Fails

#### Technicism ensures failure -- internal DOD politics and the interorganizational politics prevent effective security cooperation

**Young 2020**

Thomas-Durell, phd, Senior Lecturer at the Naval Postgraduate School,
"The \"Politics\" of Security Cooperation and Security Assistance"
September 10, 2020,
<https://www.dasadec.army.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2344014/the-politics-of-security-cooperation-and-security-assistance/>dmr

[The intrinsically political nature of military organizations is no less
true when it comes to]{.underline} armies' efforts in the education,
training, and equipping of foreign partner nations' armed forces, known
as [security cooperation]{.underline} (SC) and security assistance (SA).
[Yet much of the American bureaucracy and legal framework for these
activities treat them as fundamentally technical problems]{.underline}
that are [susceptible to improvement through better procedures. This
technicism]{.underline}, to purloin a term from Samuel Huntington,4 [is
arguably at the heart of many of our failures and disappointments in
building partner security forces]{.underline} (for example, those of
Afghanistan,5 Iraq,6 and Mali7) [or in reforming defense
institutions]{.underline} in Central and Eastern Europe.8 [Virtually
every fix proposed to partners is yet another technical or bureaucratic
adjustment rather than an acknowledgment of the fundamentally political
nature of these activities]{.underline}, both within a partner nation as
well as among U.S. agencies responsible for planning and carrying out
the assistance programs. The objective of this article is to argue that
[administration officials and Congress face two different political
challenges related to improving SC and SA. Unless and until U.S.
officials formulate solutions to these political problems, both branches
of government will struggle to achieve more effective means of reforming
partner nations' key governmental institutions]{.underline}. First---and
perhaps the easiest challenge to address---is that SC and SA have
unintended political consequences in the government institutions of
recipient countries and are not solely technical tasks. No one has
expressed this point better than Mara Karlin, albeit she was speaking in
reference to weak states: Past experience offers two key lessons for
U.S. officials as they seek to strengthen the security sectors of weak
states. First, like all [state-building endeavors]{.underline}, these
[are political, not technical]{.underline}, exercises. Instead of
focusing narrowly on training and equipment, [U.S. policymakers
responsible for implementing such programs must address the purpose and
scope of the U.S. role and the mission, leadership, and organizational
structure of the partner's military]{.underline}.9 [Second, SC and SA
are highly politicized; both are inefficient, because of the lack of
coordination between the]{.underline} Department of Defense ([DOD)
and]{.underline} Department of State, and [ineffective, because of lack
of alignment with national security goals]{.underline} (and/or foreign
policy objectives). This important reality needs wider appreciation by
these departments, as well as by Congress, if the U.S. Government is to
improve its ability to find value for money by improving partner
nations' ability to defend their sovereignty, let alone contribute to
expeditionary operations. Recent reforms initiated by Congress, most
notably in the fiscal year (FY) 2017 National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA), constitute a good first effort at addressing these longstanding
problems; however, a review of the evidence shows that this legislation
should be augmented to define the problem as largely political in
nature, as opposed to accepting the traditional default assumption that
it is solely technical, which would have enabled it to call for even
deeper reforms within these bureaucracies. This article argues that,
**[due to internal DOD politics and the interorganizational politics
within the U.S. Government, suboptimal results ensue from the way the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[plans and executes
SC]{.underline}** and SA. It then suggests legislative and policy
changes that might better take this reality into account. The stakes are
high. If U.S. strategy is to bring troops home from the so-called
endless wars overseas and let others do the fighting, then its success
must be a core priority. But [only by reforming the way the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [organizes itself to build
allies']{.underline} and partners' armed [forces are we likely to meet
with any greater success than we have in the past.]{.underline}

RETHINKING U.S. SECURITY ASSISTANCE"
https://warontherocks.com/2022/04/sweeter-carrots-and-harder-sticks-rethinking-u-s-security-assistance/)LR

[The more recent U.S. experience in Iraq from 2003 until the withdrawal
in 2011 contains echoes of Vietnam.]{.underline} David Lake's study of
that conflict suggests that provision of unconditional security
assistance may still be America's default setting. [**Despite massive
volumes of military aid** provided to the Iraqi government during this
period, **U.S**. urging to reform the security forces and national
government **repeatedly failed.**]{.underline} Nouri al-Maliki, prime
minister during much of this period, resisted efforts to make the armed
forces more broadly inclusive and apolitical, instead continuing to
employ them as his own sectarian instrument. Again, [**the United States
used an approach focused on training and equipping**, known in the
current lexicon as building partner capacity. **The Iraqi government
received assistance regardless of its effort**, or **lack thereof, to
implement much-needed reform** while the United States failed to use the
leverage which hundreds of millions of dollars of assistance could
buy.]{.underline} Several years later, the Iraqi military in which the
United States had invested so much fell apart virtually upon first
contact with the Islamic State's irregular militia. [The "**building
partner capacity" approach has two main flaws.** First, it ignores
fundamental problems, such as corruption, coup-proofing, and otherwise
weak defense institutions which additional military capacity cannot
overcome and may even exacerbate.]{.underline} Paradoxically, a focus
primarily on capacity-building often fails to build meaningful,
long-term capacity because it neglects underlying institutional
problems. [Second, **it ignores principal-agent problems by assuming
that once in possession of highly capable security forces, the partner
will wield them in a manner aligned with U.S. interests.** U.S. advisors
and diplomats may recognize the pressing need for security sector reform
in the partner.]{.underline} Unfortunately, [the ingrained culture of
U.S. security assistance seemingly relies on the false premise that with
enough U.S. training and relationship-building, other countries'
militaries will voluntarily reform even though it is often not in their
personal interests to do so. The United States is not getting the most
for its security assistance dollars.]{.underline} Programs intended to
build partner capacity tend to underperform because they fail to address
underlying weakness in defense institutions or take principal-agent
problems into account. To build meaningful, long-lasting capacity in
partners and better align security assistance with policy goals, [the
United States should shift from a "building partner capacity" approach
to a reform focus using conditional aid as leverage]{.underline}. Doing
so in an environment where security assistance is yet another arena for
strategic competition with Russia, China, and others will require
internal reform of the U.S. security assistance apparatus. Rather than a
slow-moving bureaucracy, [the United States needs an agile and
streamlined security assistance enterprise able to deliver aid rapidly
when needed and be paused or turned off just as easily when conditions
require. In short, the United States needs sweeter carrots and harder
sticks.]{.underline}

https://warroom.armywarcollege.edu/articles/more-is-not-better-fixing-security-cooperation/)LR

[**First**, each host **nation has its own unique structure**,
interests, and strategy to address threats.]{.underline} Each partner
military operates [within a set of authorities, regulations, and other
constraints or limitations that also impact the efficacy of U.S.
security cooperation engagements.]{.underline} The [relationship with
the host nation **can be particularly challenging as misalignment of
strategies**]{.underline} may reflect a classic principle-agent problem,
a simple communication problem between well-meaning partners, or a
combination of both. [Security cooperation has]{.underline} the most
[potential]{.underline} to be effective [when]{.underline} the
strategic, operational, and tactical aspects for [the United States and
its partner align.]{.underline} [**Second, U.S. national, regional and
partner-specific goals may not be coherent or compatible**.]{.underline}
U.S. national interests are typically broad and may be in competition
with one another. For instance, [one U.S. interest in a country may be
prevention of terrorist attacks against U.S. citizens while a
potentially competing interest is the adherence to the rule of law,
including due process, by the partner nation.]{.underline} Geographic
combatant commands ([GCC) develop an overarching regional campaign plan
and use security cooperation engagements to support that plan, but these
efforts may not align with those of the U.S. Ambassador and country
team, who also develop a concept for advancing U.S. interests and
engagements in their respective countries.]{.underline} The country team
is in theory the focal point for integrating all U.S. Government
programs and perspectives, including the COCOM strategies and security
assistance efforts. Their regular engagement with the host nation
contributes to a more detailed and in-depth understanding of the
partner, the unique challenges they face, and the viability of U.S.
strategies[. Yet their **country focus does not encourage a holistic
view of regional goals to the same degree as the GCC.**]{.underline}
Assessments and feedback provided by rotational forces, visiting
personnel, and analysts in [Washington can be incongruent with the
perspectives of the country team and **lead to disagreements about how
to engage effectively**. **Finally, the goals of U.S. military
service-provided units often differ from those of the regional or
country-specific teams**]{.underline}**.** [Service-provided units are
usually not assigned to the GCC.]{.underline} As rotational forces,
acting under their respective service component command, they typically
execute security cooperation in a decentralized manner. Whereas the
services are responsible for manning, training, and equipping their
forces to ensure they are ready for deployment, the GCC is focused on
its campaigns and strategies. While the two should be mutually
supporting, [some units deploy with limited knowledge or awareness of
long term strategic objectives and therefore focus on their
service-directed requirements**. In Mali**, for example, some units on
**small-scale deployments viewed** their engagements **primarily as a
unit training opportunity** or solely in support of a foreign military
sales case, **not as part of the plan to facilitate
security.**]{.underline}

# NATO Engagement Fails

## Say "No"

### 1nc No US Cred

#### Allies say no \-\-- Afghan withdrawal makes the US look like an uncredible partner

**Cooper 21**, nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council, a
former assistant secretary at the Department of State, and a US Army
combat veteran (R Clarek, American security cooperation needs an
'integrity check'," Atlantic Council,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/american-security-cooperation-needs-an-integrity-check/)

Yet successful [security cooperation]{.underline}---which includes arms
transfers, training, security assistance, treaties, or agreements---[is
built around two key principles: **trust** and **integrity** of
commitment, **both of which are at risk** today thanks to the haphazard
US withdrawal from Afghanistan]{.underline}. In the US military, [the
term "integrity check" refers to a concern about an individual's or
unit's capability or trustworthiness. Following the debacle in Kabul,
the United States and its global security cooperation posture is in dire
need of one]{.underline}. Just look at the anger expressed by stalwart
NATO allies such as the United Kingdom, which in the aftermath of 9/11
unquestionably joined in to invoke the Washington Treaty's Article 5 for
collective self-defense (the first time the Alliance ever did so). That
NATO launched its first operations outside the Euro-Atlantic area and
began a far-reaching transformation of capabilities signaled its trust
in the United States' reliability when it came to security cooperation.
[Now, treaty allies and partner nations are reassessing their bilateral
security relationships with the United States. It's not just the NATO
states caught off-guard]{.underline} by the haphazard departure from
[Afghanistan that will think twice]{.underline} before embarking upon
future military campaigns with the United States. Resolute defense
partners in the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific---including Saudi
Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan---likely also need
overt reassurance, such as a clear national-security strategy and
declared recommitments. Additionally, these partners are increasingly
feeling the need to proactively raise their own defense capabilities by
boosting their budgets or coordinating with allies to ensure regional
security along with the United States. Besides stress-testing the
integrity of American security cooperation, the [Afghanistan withdrawal
also highlights the necessity of]{.underline} staying the course on
[long-term investment in mutually beneficial security
partnerships]{.underline} with countries with which the United States
has shared interests---or shared threats. [Well before the fall of
Afghanistan, foreign partners were already questioning the reliability
of the United States]{.underline} at a time when the debate in
Washington about our global posture was becoming increasingly
politicized. The case for partnering with the United States needs to be
clearly articulated through the presence, performance, and processes of
American security cooperation. The quality of US aerospace and defense
equipment, the commitment to build capabilities, and the reassurance
that comes from partnering with the US military must include further
transparency, accountability, and predictability of policies. If not,
[American allies and partners **will be hesitant to collaborate** with
us on future shared security requirements---or simply **seek cooperation
elsewhere**]{.underline}.

## Spoilers/ "No"

### 1nc Illiberal Spoil

#### Spoilers will [ruin]{.underline} the process.

**Basu '5-18** --- Zachary; national security reporter at Axios.
\"Strongmen spoilers in Turkey and Hungary threaten Western unity\";
*Axios*; https://www.axios.com/2022/05/18/turkey-
NATO-finland-sweden-hungary-russia; //CYang

Why it matters: Critics have accused Turkish President Recep Tayyip
[[Erdoğan]{.underline}]{.mark} of [[employing]{.underline}]{.mark} a
\"**[[hostage-taking]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" tactic [also practiced by
Hungary]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} for weeks has been
[singlehandedly blocking]{.underline} the [European]{.underline} Union
[from imposing]{.underline} an [embargo on Russian oil]{.underline}. The
[**outsized [influence]{.mark}** [of single]{.mark}-member
[states]{.mark} in]{.underline} the EU and [NATO]{.underline} has drawn
increased scrutiny in recent years, especially as both Hungary and
Turkey have drifted toward authoritarianism and strengthened their ties
with Russia. Their resistance to two critical Western priorities risks
[[undermin]{.mark}ing the **[united front]{.mark}**]{.underline} that
[leaders]{.underline} like President Biden [have **touted** as key to
**effectively responding**]{.underline} to Russia\'s invasion of
Ukraine. Driving the news: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who
has said he is \"very confident\" all NATO allies will ultimately
approve Sweden and Finland\'s applications, will meet on Wednesday with
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu. Çavuşoğlu said Sunday that in
exchange for Turkey lifting its opposition, Sweden and Finland must end
their alleged support for Kurdish groups that Turkey views as terrorists
and a top national security threat. Turkey is also expected to use its
leverage to seek bilateral concessions from the U.S., including speeding
up the potential sale of F-16 fighter jets. Between the liens: Özgür
Ünlühisarcıklı, director of the German Marshall Fund\'s office in
Ankara, told Axios that Erdoğan \"saw an opportunity to extract some
benefits both for Turkey and for his own political standing\" ahead of a
crucial election next year. [[Erdoğan]{.mark} believes
he\'s]{.underline} \"more or less [free to [do **whatever he
wants**]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Ünlühisarcıklı said. He argued it\'s
[[hard to stand up]{.mark} to Erdogan on this issue]{.underline},
[[given]{.underline}]{.mark} the [high stakes]{.underline} of Sweden and
Finland\'s NATO applications, [and the **unique [role]{.mark}** [Turkey
is playing]{.mark}]{.underline} in Ukraine as both a mediator in peace
talks and supplier of highly effective drones. Critics, meanwhile, say
the [[stunt]{.underline}]{.mark} could [[set]{.mark} a
**[precedent]{.mark}**]{.underline} for [[other NATO leaders]{.mark} to
**essentially [seek]{.mark}** [bribes in]{.mark} moments of
[crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} --- with some going as far as to call
Turkey a \"Trojan horse\" within the Western alliance. Zoom out: That
label has long been used to describe [[Hungary\'s]{.underline}]{.mark}
role as [a **[spoiler]{.mark}**]{.underline} within the EU. [Hungary\'s
far-right]{.underline} prime minister Viktor [Orbán]{.underline} is
viewed as [the **most pro-Russian leader**]{.underline} in the EU, and
[for weeks]{.underline} has [[used]{.mark} his [**veto** to
prevent]{.mark}]{.underline} the bloc from [[banning]{.mark} imports of
[Russian oil]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the meantime, Orbán has used his
[leverage to pressure]{.underline} the EU to send [Hungary a **financial
compensation** package]{.underline} --- **[effectively
[neutralizing]{.mark}]{.underline}** Brussels\' **[[landmark
decision]{.underline}]{.mark}** this year [to withhold pandemic recovery
funds from Hungary]{.underline} over its democratic backsliding.

### 2nc Illiberal Spoil

#### Democratic backsliding ensures political divisions wrecking NATO cohesion

**Flockhart 2021**

Trine Flockhart is Professor of International Relations in the
Department of Political Science and Public Management at the University
of Southern Denmark and Co-Director of the Center for War Studies.
Trine's research focuses on international order and processes of change
and transformation, the crisis in the liberal international order,
resilience and NATO and transatlantic relations. "Democratic Backsliding
and Contested Values Within the Alliance," NATO 2030: Towards a New
Strategic Concept and Beyond, (177-194), 2021.dmr

The authors of the 2030 report are correct in emphasizing the importance
of NATO's commitment to shared values, but it must also be recognized
that [in the current political environment, agreement about]{.underline}
those [values can no longer be taken for granted]{.underline}---this is
the case both [within the Alliance]{.underline}, but it is also a wider
problem reflecting that there is now a broadly shared consensus that
[the basic norms underpinning the overall liberal international order
are under pressure]{.underline} and that global politics will be shaped
by open disagreements about its basic values.8 The very same challenging
international security environment that makes the commitment essential
has also stirred political sentiments within the Alliance that may make
it difficult---perhaps even impossible---for the Alliance to live up to
the commitment. [[**Democracy today is in crisis and NATO's foundational
values are contested in several member states such as Hungary, Turkey,
and even Poland**. In these]{.mark} member [states]{.mark}, the
possibility of [democratic backsliding]{.mark} is today no longer
unthinkable---it [is already taking
place]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}9 [[Even some of the oldest
democracies---the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, [[Britain, and France---face diminishing
confidence in their democratic institutions]{.mark} and significant
disruptions in their domestic politics. [The rise of right-wing,
authoritarian-style populism]{.mark} and an apparent mainstreaming of
national(ist) politics is no longer just an abstract threat but a
reality that [is currently]{.mark} in the process of [altering long
established cleavage structures in party
politics]{.mark}]{.underline}.11 [**[These changes seem likely to result
in new political divisions within the Alliance between liberal
internationalism and illiberal nationalism]{.underline}**. [Clearly such
a situation will have **profound ramifications for cohesion** within the
Alliance and for the continued shared commitment to NATO's foundational
values]{.underline}.]{.mark} This chapter asks if the Alliance can
continue to live up to its commitment to "democracy, individual liberty
and rule of law" and asks how **[[democratic backsliding may constitute
an existential threat to NATO]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The chapter
consists of four sections. The first section outlines how NATO has
historically been able to adapt to a frequently changing external
strategic environment to meet a seemingly never-ending stream of
crises---qualities that arguably made NATO a resilient institution. In
the second section, the chapter attributes NATO's resilience to the
ability of the Alliance to balance between two different, but
intertwined identities---an identity as a defense alliance and an
identity as a community of values.12 The chapter demonstrates that
historically, NATO's crises, tensions, and contradictions have primarily
been associated with the identity as a defense alliance, whereas the
value foundation of the Alliance has been continuously reinforced and
reified through deeply embedded practices associated with NATO's
identity as a community of values. In the third section, the chapter
shows that today, the situation has changed fundamentally as the
Alliance is doing well in areas that have historically caused the most
concern such as its military capabilities, whereas NATO's assumed
bedrock of strength---its stable identity, deeply embedded practices,
and shared values---is now contested from within its own ranks. In the
final section, the chapter turns to contemplating NATO's future and the
prospects for NATO not only to return to long-established practices to
reinforce the shared values of the Alliance, but also the prospects for
the Alliance to reorient itself towards a very different and challenging
strategic environment.

#### NATO has no solidarity -- illiberal members spoil the plan -- the plan can't overcome these structural differences

**Dempsey '18** --- Judy; nonresident senior fellow at Carnegie Europe
and editor in chief of Strategic Europe. April 3, 2018; \"NATO's Bad
Apples\"; *Carnegie Europe*;

Over the past few years --- and in particular, over the past nine months
--- [[several members]{.mark} of the]{.underline} U.S.-led [military
alliance]{.underline} have [**[run]{.mark} roughshod** [over]{.mark}
NATO [solidarity]{.mark}]{.underline} and the basic principles upon
which the alliance was founded in April 1949.
[[Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, actually
[[revealed]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[positions of French troops
in]{.mark} **northeast [Syria]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since 2016,
according to the AFP, these forces have been based in areas controlled
by the YPG/PKK. The Kurdish YPG dominates the Syrian Democratic Forces
(SDF). President Recep Tayyip [Erdoğan]{.underline} recently **[sharply
criticized]{.underline}** his French counterpart, Emmanuel
[Macron]{.underline}, [for meeting SDF leaders in Paris]{.underline} and
for offering to mediate between the SDF and Turkey. For Erdoğan, that
was tantamount to negotiating with the Syrian branch of the PKK, which
Ankara insists is a terrorist organization. Yet Erdoğan went further. A
Turkish news agency revealed the positions of the French forces.
[What]{.underline} sort of [solidarity]{.underline} and discretion [does
that amount to]{.underline}, [when one ally]{.underline} could
**[endanger another]{.underline}**? Closer to home, NATO has to contend
with [[Poland and Hungary undermining]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[independen]{.mark}ce of the [judiciary and]{.mark}]{.underline} an
[independent [media]{.mark}]{.underline}, not to mention that way in
which nongovernmental organizations in Hungary have been vilified and
refugees refused shelter. Then there is the corruption in the alliance's
newest member, [[Montenegro]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the [persistent
[attacks]{.mark} on]{.underline} the [[judiciary]{.mark} and
**anticorruption [watchdogs]{.mark}** [in Romania]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Altogether, [**these examples [do much]{.mark}** [to undermine
**NATO**]{.mark} **as an alliance**]{.underline}, whose members pledge
"to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilization of their
peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty, and
the rule of law. They seek to promote stability and well-being in the
North Atlantic area." Back in the last 1940s, the rule of law and
democracy didn't matter that much for NATO. The alliance's priorities
focused on the security, safety, and protection of its members (in
short, the West). When Greece and Turkey joined NATO in 1952, their
membership was about bolstering the defenses of this part of Europe
against the Soviet threat. Geostrategic interests and strengthening the
anti-Communist bulwark took precedence over the rule of law and strong,
democratic, accountable institutions. In recent years, when it's come to
countries wanting to join NATO, there has been more emphasis on values
and democracy. But in its own home, [[NATO's record for
upholding]{.mark} **basic [principles]{.mark}**]{.underline} is [[far
from stellar]{.underline}]{.mark}. [And]{.underline} its [[reluctance to
criticize]{.underline}]{.mark} its [allies [exposes]{.mark}]{.underline}
some of [its **[intrinsic weaknesses]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The first
is that [NATO countries are **loathed** to criticize each
other]{.underline}, either publicly or even behind closed doors in the
North Atlantic Council (NAC) --- the forum in which alliance ambassadors
meet. The NAC got its fingers badly burned during the U.S-led war
against Iraq in 2002. Apart from NATO countries being so bitterly
divided over the invasion, [[NAC sessions]{.underline}]{.mark} often
[ended up in **[shouting matches]{.mark}**]{.underline} between the
American and French ambassadors. [NATO's fragility]{.underline} was
[exposed for all to see]{.underline}. Yet, wasn't it necessary for
ambassadors to speak out? Yes, they are constrained by their own
governments. But [if [NATO could not]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and did
not --- [[speak]{.mark} out [against **torture**]{.mark}]{.underline},
or renditions, or the [illegality of the U.S. invasion of
**[Iraq]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [or]{.underline}]{.mark} what is now
happening to **[[Turkey]{.mark}'s democratic
institutions]{.underline}**, then [[what does that say about the
alliance]{.mark}'s principles]{.underline}? The second weakness is that
[[NATO doesn't have]{.mark} **formal [mechanisms]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
suspend an ally]{.underline}. And [even if it wanted to [discipline a
member]{.mark}]{.underline}, [that would require
**consensus**]{.underline}.

[[Within]{.underline}]{.mark} an [alliance that operates by
[consensus]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [[Turkish
strongman]{.underline}]{.mark} has [come to be]{.underline} seen as
something of [[a **stickup artist**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
[[2009]{.underline}]{.mark}, he [[blocked]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[appointment of]{.underline} a new [NATO [chief from
Denmark]{.mark}]{.underline}, complaining that the country was too
tolerant of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad and too sympathetic to
"Kurdish terrorists" based in Turkey. It took hours of cajoling by
Western leaders, and a face-to-face promise from President Barack Obama
that NATO would appoint a Turk to a leadership position, to satisfy Mr.
Erdogan. [After]{.underline} a [rupture]{.underline} in relations
[between Turkey and Israel]{.underline} the next year, Mr. [Erdogan
[prevented]{.mark} the [alliance from **working**]{.mark} **with the
Jewish state** [for **six years**]{.mark}]{.underline}. A few years
later, Mr. [Erdogan [delayed for months]{.mark}]{.underline} a [NATO
[plan to fortify Eastern Europe]{.mark}an]{.underline} countries
[against Russia]{.underline}, again citing Kurdish militants and
demanding that the alliance declare ones operating in Syria to be
terrorists. In 2020, Mr. Erdogan sent a gas-exploration ship backed by
fighter jets close to Greek waters, causing France to send ships in
support of Greece, also a NATO member. Now the [Turkish
leader]{.underline} is back in [the role of
**[obstructionist]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and is once again invoking the
Kurds, [as he charges]{.underline} that [[Sweden and Finland]{.mark}
sympathize with]{.underline} the [Kurdish militants]{.underline} he has
made his main enemy. "These countries have almost become guesthouses for
terrorist organizations," he said this month. "It is not possible for us
to be in favor." Mr. [Erdogan's stance is a [reminder of a
**long**]{.mark}**-festering [problem]{.mark}** [for
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}, which currently has 30 members. Russia's
invasion of Ukraine may have given the alliance a new sense of mission,
but NATO must still contend with an [[**authoritarian leader** willing
to]{.mark} use his leverage to]{.underline} gain political points at
home by [[block]{.mark}ing [consensus]{.mark}]{.underline} --- at least
for a time.

[[Tensions]{.mark} within NATO [over Turkey]{.mark}'s
demands]{.underline} for concessions [from Finland and
Sweden]{.underline} in exchange for backing the Nordic states'
membership of the Western alliance [[show **no signs** of
abating]{.underline}]{.mark}, [even as Western officials seek to play
them down]{.underline}. Sweden confirmed today that it is sending a
delegation to Ankara to discuss its decision to formally apply for NATO
membership in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The move is
further evidence that [Turkey's objections have not been
overcome]{.underline}. Upping the ante, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip
[[Erdogan said]{.underline}]{.mark} today [[they]{.underline}]{.mark}
"**[[need not bother]{.mark} to come]{.underline}**" unless military
sanctions imposed by the Nordic countries on Turkey were rescinded. "The
[[crisis mode]{.mark} is [confirmed]{.mark}]{.underline}," a source with
close knowledge of the discussions told Al-Monitor. The source said
[there were **few signs**]{.underline}, [if any]{.underline}, that
[Turkey was ready to drop its demands]{.underline} that both countries
cease what Ankara calls their support for "terrorists." It is referring
in particular to Kurdish groups sympathetic to imprisoned Kurdish leader
Abdullah Ocalan and Pennsylvania-based Sunni cleric Fethullah Gulen.
Turkey accuses Gulen of orchestrating the failed attempt to violently
overthrow the government in 2016. Turkey's Islamic-leaning Justice and
Development Party government is also demanding that both countries end
their arms embargoes on Turkey over its military intervention in 2019
against the Kurds in northeast Syria. Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut
Cavusoglu said on Sunday that progress was being made with Finland on
the issue but that Sweden was continuing to be "provocative." He did not
elaborate. US Secretary of State Tony Blinken said he had spoken to
Cavusoglu after a meeting of NATO foreign ministers that was held Sunday
in Berlin, and he was confident that consensus could be struck. NATO
Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said he was confident that "we will
be able to address the concerns that Turkey has expressed in a way that
doesn't delay the membership or accession process." Turkey's real beef
is with Sweden, a long-time sanctuary for Turkish dissidents of all
stripes since 1980 when Turkey's generals carried out their last hard
coup. In Sunday's meeting, Cavusoglu was described by the source as
being "very tough." Cavusoglu demanded that Sweden and Finland publicly
acknowledge that there are links between Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers
Party (PKK) and the Syrian Kurdish groups running the autonomous region
in northeast Syria that is protected by US special operation forces.
Cavusgolu singled out Sweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde and what he
called her "so-called feminist policy." It was an overt swipe at Linde's
overt embrace of the Syrian Kurdish leadership, which has strong female
representation in keeping with Ocalan's emphasis on gender equality.
Ilham Ahmed, the executive president of the Syrian Democratic Council,
one of the main arms of the Syrian Kurdish administration, has met
numerous times with Linde in Stockholm. Britain's Foreign Secretary Liz
Truss pushed back "very hard" against Cavusoglu, saying the priority
should be "to not send the wrong message to Russia." "Finland Sweden's
decision to seek NATO membership is a historic step. The position of
Turkey and the Erdogan regime on this is frankly bizarre and not
surprising," said Feryal Clark, the first Kurdish Turkish member of the
UK parliament for Labor and a member of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly.
"It's another example of Erdogan's regime trying to further isolate and
cut off support for Kurdish minorities," she told Al-Monitor. In 2020,
Linde angered Cavusoglu by telling him that Turkey must withdraw from
northeast Syria. The Turkish Justice Ministry on Monday announced that
Ankara had requested the extradition of six alleged PKK members from
Finland and 11 alleged PKK members from Sweden. Ankara's demands have
struck a raw nerve in Sweden, a country that has long prided itself on
putting human rights first in its foreign policy. "Ankara's statements
do raise concern in Sweden, as they come at a time when the \[ruling\]
Social Democrats have just taken a very difficult decision to change
position on the question of NATO membership," noted Paul Levin, director
of Stockholm University's Institute for Turkish Studies. Turkey's
demands of the Swedish government "hits right at the reason many on the
left have been uneasy over NATO membership --- the fear that Sweden
would lose its voice on matters concerning human rights and democracy."
"There is a great deal of sympathy for the Kurdish cause, especially on
the left, and I think it will be difficult \[for Sweden\] to make any
meaningful concessions," Levin told Al-Monitor. And with elections
looming in Turkey and Sweden alike, "There is a risk that a mutual
inability to be seen as backing down could make for a difficult road
ahead," Levin added. "The issue is serious," concurred Aaron Stein,
director of research at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a think
tank in Philadelphia. Stein sees parallels with Turkey's reaction to US
support for the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG). Sweden's
"big sin," he told Al-Monitor, is "that they adopted the same policy as
the United States, which is that they view the YPG and the PKK as
separate entities." Sweden is one of the first countries to have
followed in Turkey's steps, treating the PKK as a terrorist organization
since the early 1980s. "They are using a strict interpretation of the
law to facilitate a policy in Syria of using the YPG to go after the
Islamic State," Stein noted, much as the United States has done, leading
to a meltdown in US Turkish ties. This is [[hardly the first
time]{.underline}]{.mark} that [Erdogan is **playing [hardball]{.mark}**
with NATO]{.underline}. In 2009, [Turkey]{.underline} withdrew its
[[objections to]{.underline}]{.mark} the nomination of Anders Fogh
[[Rasmussen]{.underline}]{.mark}, a former Danish prime minister, to
lead the alliance only after the last-minute intervention by
then-President Barack Obama. Turkey was opposed to Rasmussen [[because
of]{.underline}]{.mark} his defense of free speech in the midst of the
Danish [[cartoons]{.underline}]{.mark} crisis over depictions of the
Prophet Mohammed that were deemed to be blasphemous. In 2019, [Turkey
held up [defense plans for]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[Baltic
s]{.mark}tates and Poland]{.underline}, [insisting]{.underline} that
[NATO needed to recognize the YPG as a terrorist]{.underline} threat and
defend Turkey against it. "It took some bureaucratic chicanery to get
that one through," recalled Stein. [This included **greater [Turkish
representation]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[high]{.mark}er
[echelons]{.mark}** of NATO]{.underline}. "Of course \[[the **current
[crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}\] probably will be worked out, but again,
they [[made a **spectacle**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and in so
doing]{.underline}]{.mark}, they **[[undermined NATO
solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark}** at a time when two members want to
join because they correctly fear Russian aggression. [Turkey elevated
its own]{.underline} security [issues over those of the **collective
security of the alliance**]{.underline}."

Under current circumstances, the [[most prominent]{.mark} cases of
[disputes]{.mark} among NATO members include
**[Turkey]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in an overall context of the
[country's government **no longer interested** in being an integral part
of the]{.underline} '[West]{.underline}.'4 [Tensions occur [both]{.mark}
at the [bilateral]{.mark} level]{.underline} between Turkey and
individual members of the Alliance---notably [[with]{.underline}]{.mark}
Turkey's 'traditional' antagonist [[Greece]{.underline}]{.mark}, but
[also]{.underline} the [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and
[F]{.mark}rance]{.underline}---[and]{.underline} at the [multilateral
level]{.underline}, [with [Ankara blocking **strategic
cooperation**]{.mark} between]{.underline} the [NATO and the European
Union]{.underline} or NATO and partner countries such as Armenia,
Jordan, or Israel. [[Greece and Turkey have]{.mark} a **[longstanding
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} over Cyprus, as well as disputes over
natural resources in contested waters. The United States notably ejected
Turkey from the F-35 program after Turkey purchased the S-400 air
defense system from Russia.5 Franco-[[Turkish
tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}, finally, [[are
**multi-dimensional**]{.mark} in nature [and range from **personal
attacks**]{.mark}]{.underline} [between presidents **Erdoğan** and
**Macron**]{.underline}, religious and cultural issues, to geo-strategic
rivalry.6 The two countries even came close to a military clash in the
Eastern Mediterranean in the summer of 2020. France's frigate Courbet,
part of NATO's maritime security Operation Sea Guardian, was illuminated
by Turkish targeting radar when approaching a cargo ship suspected of
breaching the arms embargo in Libya, escorted by the Turkish navy. As
France did not obtain the desired support among other NATO allies in the
incident's aftermath, it temporarily withdrew from Operation Sea
Guardian.7 Paris' positioning on Libya, where it unofficially sided with
General Haftar, is widely considered to be the cause for this absence of
support from other NATO members. Beyond NATO, these issues also matter
in the EU context where Germany and other EU member states blocked the
adoption of sanctions against Turkey.8 [[Western Europeans
are]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[**not on the same page** when it comes
to dealing with Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[which is **hardly
surprising**]{.underline}]{.mark} given their very different relations
with Ankara. Moreover, the fact that the European Union---and Germany as
the main actor behind the so-called EU-Turkey refugee deal9 in
particular---has made itself dependent on Turkey to control flows of
migration to Europe limits its room for maneuver.10 Beyond bilateral
conflicts, security dynamics in the Eastern Mediterranean are
increasingly a cause for concern.11 These include, inter alia,
conflicting territorial claims and conflicts over natural resources or
countries' positioning in the Syrian and Libyan wars---with, in all
cases, Turkey as a key actor. Likewise, Turkey's actions in the
September 2020 flare-up of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict have been
analyzed as the country's "pursuing the goal of undermining the current
status quo in the region."12 Ankara's military offensives in Syria
against Kurdish-led forces, fighting against ISIS as US allies, also
revealed deep rifts among NATO countries and further complicated the
situation in the Middle East.13 **[[All these incidents point toward the
structural estrangement between the West, NATO, and Turkey rather than
merely differences over policies that can be solved by compromise. They
are therefore likely to have long-term implications for the Alliance's
cohesion and ability to act]{.underline}]{.mark}**, including in shaping
a closer relationship between NATO and the European Union as one of the
key undertakings of Euro-Atlantic security.

French President Emmanuel [[Macron]{.underline}]{.mark} created a stir
last November when he [[said]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[NATO]{.mark} is
[experiencing]{.mark} a]{.underline} "**[[brain
death]{.underline}]{.mark}**." This single comment created a flurry of
reactions as Member States attempted to justify the existence of NATO.
Macron's comments [must be taken seriously]{.underline} when we consider
that [France]{.underline} in 1959 [withdrew]{.underline} its
[Mediterranean Fleet from NATO command]{.underline} [and]{.underline} in
1966 the French military [left NATO's integrated military
command]{.underline} and demanded all foreign NATO soldiers to leave
France. US Secretary of State Dean Rusk attempted to guilt the highly
independent French President Charles [de Gaulle]{.underline} for his
decision to [kick out foreign soldiers]{.underline} by asking if "the
bodies of American soldiers in France's cemeteries" who died in the two
world wars also had to leave.

It was the Anglo-American hegemony that de Gaulle resisted, and it can
be argued that [Macron]{.underline} is [attempting to **re-[establish
France's independence]{.mark}**]{.underline} after former French
President Nicolas Sarkozy reintegrated France into NATO in 2009. A
[clear indicator]{.underline} that [Macron]{.underline} is [following
in]{.underline} the [steps of de Gaulle]{.underline} is when he
furthered the former president's famous phrase that Europe stretches
"from Lisbon to the Urals" in Russia by saying Europe's territory
stretches all the way to Vladivostok near the Chinese and North Korean
borders.

However, Macron's stinging attacks against NATO did not end with that
single comment from November 2019. Last week [Macron said]{.underline}
that the [[Franco-Turkish naval incident]{.underline}]{.mark} was "one
of [**the most [beautiful]{.mark}** [demonstration]{.mark}s]{.underline}
that [there is a brain death]{.underline}" [of NATO]{.underline}. A
[Turkish warship harassed]{.underline} a [French]{.underline} navy
[vessel]{.underline} participating in a NATO mission, [prompting
France's defence ministry to say]{.underline} that

> "[[this is]{.underline}]{.mark} an [**extremely aggressive**
> act]{.underline} that is [[unacceptable]{.mark} by]{.underline} an
> [ally against a NATO ship]{.underline}. [We consider this]{.underline}
> [an extremely grave]{.underline} matter. [We cannot
> accept]{.underline} that an [ally behaves this way]{.underline}, that
> it does this against a NATO ship, under NATO command, carrying out a
> NATO mission."

[NATO is **certainly**]{.underline} "[brain dead]{.underline}" as it
primarily exists to pressurize Russia despite the collapse of the Soviet
Union nearly three decades ago. To justify its existence, it has gone on
campaigns of aggression by destroying Yugoslavia and Libya, and
supporting reactionary forces like jihadist groups in Syria. It is now
strongly suggested that [France wants to embark on an **independent
path**]{.underline}, especially [as]{.underline} a **[[lack of
comradery]{.underline}]{.mark}** is [found with[in the
Alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Turkey, leveraging its large military, geostrategic positioning on the
crossroads of Europe and Asia, and controlling the Straits into the
Black Sea, is attempting to balance its relations with NATO and Russia
to pursue its own ambition to dominant the entire region, including the
Eastern Mediterranean. [Moscow]{.underline} wants to [strengthen
relations with Turkey]{.underline} knowing it will antagonize NATO,
while [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} continues to [tolerate
Turkey's]{.underline} unilateral and [aggressive actions]{.underline}.
[NATO's tolerance to Turkish aggression]{.underline} is [so
high]{.underline} that [it is **always [silent]{.mark}** [on Turkey's
**daily violations** of Greek]{.mark} maritime and
[airspace]{.mark}]{.underline}, despite Greece being a fellow NATO
member.

The Turkish aggression against France in the Mediterranean a few weeks
ago was one that could not be ignored. As Greece is not as
geostrategically important to NATO in comparison to Turkey, aggression
against it is always ignored and tolerated by NATO. However, Turkish
aggression against a nuclear power like France was never going to be
sidelined and ignored. Ankara made a blunder thinking that the same
aggression it does against Greece would be tolerated by France.

As [Turkey]{.underline} is [[propping up]{.underline}]{.mark} and
protecting the Muslim Brotherhood Government of National Accords based
in the Libyan capital of [[Tripoli]{.mark} and]{.underline} their
[jihadist allies]{.underline}, [France]{.underline} is
[backing]{.underline} its rival, [the Libyan National Army]{.underline}.
This has been another cause of division between France and Turkey,
prompting [[Macron]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[say]{.underline}]{.mark}
yesterday:

> "I think [this [is a **historic** and **criminal**
> responsibility]{.mark} for]{.underline} someone who claims to be a
> member of [NATO]{.underline}."

He made the comments after holding talks with German Chancellor Angela
Merkel, considered Turkey's closest ally in Europe. He [added that
Turkey's conduct in Libya is]{.underline}
"**[unacceptable]{.underline}** to us" and that Ankara needs to
"urgently clarify" its stance.

[[Macron is not hiding his contempt for]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Turkish]{.mark} government and [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} at all. He
is also the only major Western leader that is open to friendly relations
with Russia. [[France]{.underline}]{.mark} is now [[pushing for
a]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[European Army]{.underline}]{.mark}"
**[[outside of NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [As]{.underline} the
[Alliance]{.underline} continues to [tolerate Turkey's aggressive
actions]{.underline} in the Mediterranean, [this]{.underline} could
[push France further]{.underline} away [from NATO]{.underline}, an
interesting turn of events considering the past two years there were
endless speculations that it was Turkey being pushed away from NATO over
its acquisition of the Russian S-400 missile defense system.

[NATO's]{.underline} continued [appeasement of [Turkish
aggression]{.mark}]{.underline} that even [threatens Member States could
be **[the]{.mark} very [catalyst that]{.mark} will [see France]{.mark}
once again [leave the Alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Although a Pew
survey from February found that only 37% of Greeks were favorable
towards NATO, the second lowest surveyed, the Greek political elite will
continue to be subservient to NATO, counter to Greece's own interests
and defense concerns. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that Greece
would leave NATO. The same survey found that only 49% of French people
were favorable towards NATO, which surely has dropped even further after
Macron's most recent statements and Turkish actions against the French
Navy. Effectively, [as NATO]{.underline} continues to [appease Turkish
aggression]{.underline} against even fellow Member States, the
[[Alliance is]{.mark} only [**pushing France out** as Macron]{.mark}
sets himself up to be the]{.underline} Charles [[de Gaulle of the
**21st**]{.mark} **century**]{.underline}.

)//RG

Just [when it seemed like Finland and Sweden's accession into NATO was
imminent, Turkey has]{.underline} [taken]{.underline} its [allies by
surprise by **throwing a wrench into the works.**]{.underline} President
Recep Tayyip [Erdogan said]{.underline} on Thursday that Tur[key planned
to reject the]{.underline} two nations' [bids to join the
alliance,]{.underline} after [having accused them]{.underline} earlier
[of being]{.underline} "like [guesthouses for terror
organizations."]{.underline} "We told relevant friends that [we will say
no to Sweden's and Finland's entry into NATO **and we will continue our
path like that,"**]{.underline} he said during a conference with
students in Ankara. Finland and Sweden formally applied to join NATO on
Wednesday at Allied headquarters in Brussels, driven by Russia's
invasion of Ukraine. The decision represents a setback for Moscow, with
the war in Ukraine triggering the kind of enlargement of the alliance
that it invaded Ukraine to prevent. **[Accession of new
states]{.underline}** however [**requires consensus among existing
members**, and that's where Ankara comes in. Turkey]{.underline}, which
joined the alliance three years after it was established in 1949 and has
the group's second largest army, has [said it won't support the bids
unless its demands are met.]{.underline} Erdogan accused the two
countries of harboring members of the separatist militant Kurdistan's
Workers Party, also known as PKK. The PKK, which seeks an independent
state in Turkey, has been in an armed struggle with that country for
decades and has been designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the
United States and the European Union. He said on Wednesday that [Sweden
should not expect Turkey to approve its bid without returning
"terrorists," and]{.underline} Swedish and Finnish [delegations should
not come to Turkey to convince it to back their membership]{.underline}
in the alliance. US President Joe Biden met with Swedish Prime Minister
Magdalena Andersson and Finnish President Sauli Niinistö at the White
House to discuss their NATO applications on Thursday, pledging them the
"complete backing" of the United States. When asked on Wednesday how he
will convince Turkey to support Finland and Sweden's bids for
membership, Biden told reporters, "I think we're gonna be OK." [The
crisis **has brought to the fore longstanding Turkish grievances against
Western nations and NATO allies,** while it has given Ankara an
opportunity to use its position]{.underline} in the alliance [to extract
concessions. Turkey has complained about the lack of
support]{.underline} it has received [in its fight against Kurdish
militants,]{.underline} which Ankara perceives as its top national
security threat. [It has accused Sweden of harboring its
adversaries]{.underline} and providing support to Kurdish militants in
northern Syria, whom Ankara considers an extension of the PKK. Ankara
also says that the two nations haven't responded to extradition
requests, according to state media. The wanted individuals are accused
of having links to the PKK as well as FETO -- the group led by US-based
cleric Fetullah Gulen whom Turkey believes was behind the 2016 failed
coup attempt (an allegation Gulen denies). Finland and Sweden voiced
optimism on Tuesday that common ground can be found with Turkey over its
objections. Sweden's finance minister Mikael Damberg told public
broadcaster SVT on Monday that his country is not a "friend of
terrorism," and that it takes "very seriously anything that has to do
with terrorism." "We will of course use diplomacy, we will clarify any
possible uncertainties," he said. Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde
said on Saturday that her country, just like the rest of the EU,
considered PKK a terrorist organization. The government has said it is
ready to iron out any obstacles in talks with Turkey. Ankara has also
demanded that Sweden and Finland drop an arms embargo that was slapped
on Turkey in 2019 following its military offensive in northeastern
Syria. Turkey launched the operation against the Kurdish-led YPG forces
that were allied with the United States and other Western nations in
their fight against ISIS. The offensive drew condemnation from the US
and the EU, and led several European countries to impose an arms embargo
on Ankara. ["We would not say yes to those who impose sanctions on
Turkey to join NATO]{.underline}," Erdogan told reporters Monday
evening. "Because [then NATO would]{.underline} cease to be a security
organization and [become a place where representatives of terrorist
organizations are concentrated."]{.underline} The Turkish President is
no stranger to fiery rhetoric, particularly around the time of
elections, when a boost on the home front could help at the polls.
Turkey goes to elections next year and experts believe the current state
of the economy -- record-high inflation and a currency that has lost
nearly half its value in the past year -- will cost Erdogan at the
polls. Analysts say that [Turkey's veto in NATO may be used as leverage
not just against future members, but current ones too.]{.underline} "It
may not all be about Sweden and Finland," Asli Aydintasbas, senior
policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations wrote in an
article. "[The president]{.underline} almost certainly **[sees this as
an opportune moment to air his grievances about existing NATO
members]{.underline}**, especially with the Biden administration, which
has kept the Turkish leader at arm's length." A key issue might be the
Turkish President's disappointment at being unable to establish a
working relationship with Biden as he did with his predecessors,
according to Aydintasbas. Erdogan complained to reporters last month
that he and Biden didn't have the kind of relationship he had with
Presidents Trump and Obama. "Of course, there are some meetings from
time to time, but they should've been more advanced," he said. "My wish
is that we can achieve this in the following process." [This isn't the
first time Turkey has objected to new members]{.underline}, Aydintasbas
pointed out. ["It is unlikely that Erdogan had one specific policy goal
in mind]{.underline}, but [he will]{.underline} no doubt expect to [be
cajoled, persuaded, and eventually rewarded for his
cooperation,]{.underline} as in the past," Aydintasbas wrote on Monday
referring to previous Turkish veto threats within NATO. While
[Turkey]{.underline} has [security concerns]{.underline} that even the
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said must be addressed, the
[optics are far from flattering, **with Turkey choosing to air its
grievances and appear as a spoiler at a time when the alliance's unity
may have never been more important.**]{.underline}

### 2nc Hungary Spoils

#### Here's [comparative evidence]{.underline} --- NATO's biggest threat is internal backsliding & Orban.

Center for American Progress. Siena Cicarelli is Research and Program

Hungary's Democratic Backsliding Should Prompt NATO To Act\"; *Center

NATO-act/; //CYang

[[Hungary's]{.mark} democratic [backsliding and]{.mark} **increasingly
[nationalist]{.mark}** [rhetoric]{.mark} threatens]{.underline} the
[stability of]{.underline} the alliance. [NATO]{.underline} needs to
respond.

On June 6, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Órban visited a small town on
the Hungarian-Slovak border to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the
signing of the Treaty of Trianon. The agreement, signed in the wake of
World War I, dramatically shrunk Hungary's territory from its
Austro-Hungarian empire borders, resulting in Hungary ceding two-thirds
of its territory and leaving sizable populations of ethnic Hungarians
outside of the new boundaries. In his speech, which was imbued with
nationalist resentment, Órban described every Hungarian child inside and
outside of the country's borders as a "guard post" to protect national
identity. Additionally, he boasted about the speed at which Hungary has
increased defense spending and built "a new army," proclaiming, "We
haven't been this strong in a hundred years."

Órban's deliberately provocative and threatening speech was not a
nationalist dog whistle intended only for the Hungarian public. Rather,
it directly suggested that a significant amount of territory belonging
to Hungary's neighbors to the east --- Romania, Slovakia, and Ukraine
--- should be considered Hungarian.

Órban's rhetoric --- and Hungary's rapidly backsliding democracy ---
should serve as a wake-up call to the [**[N]{.mark}**orth
**[A]{.mark}**tlantic **[T]{.mark}**reaty
**[O]{.mark}**rganization]{.underline}. Today, the alliance [faces a
[growing]{.mark} and **pernicious [threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}: the
[rise of **illiberal [nationalism]{.mark}** [within its
ranks]{.mark}]{.underline}. This [[internal threat]{.mark} is
one]{.underline} that an [[alliance]{.mark} built on cooperation of
**individual nation-states** and premised on states working together [is
**ill-suited** to address]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, NATO has
been encouraging member states to devote more resources to national
defense. However, this begs the question of whether the alliance should
encourage an autocratic Hungary to massively increase its defense
spending when it could use its military capabilities to threaten its
neighbors. With Turkey stoking tension with Greece in the eastern
Mediterranean, leading to fears of conflict between two NATO members,
the [**internal threat** of nationalism to NATO's cohesion is
clear]{.underline}. It is time for the NATO alliance to get serious
about the threat posed by rising nationalism and democratic backsliding
among its member states.

A backsliding Hungary

Over the past decade, the Órban regime has relentlessly attacked
Hungarian democracy. Today, Freedom House maintains that, given the
government's tight control over the media and independent institutions,
Hungary can no longer be considered a democracy. During the COVID-19
pandemic, Órban has taken on emergency powers that allow him to rule by
decree, further consolidating his power over the government. This
descent into authoritarianism has also gone hand in hand with the
regime's efforts to inflame Hungarian nationalism and provoke
confrontation with Hungary's neighbors.

Órban has followed a tactic employed by Russia, wherein President
Vladimir Putin issued passports to Russian populations outside of their
borders. In 2011, Órban similarly expanded Hungary's citizenship laws,
issuing passports to ethnic Hungarians in surrounding countries. And
while Órban has made it exceedingly difficult for Hungarians who have
moved abroad to vote, Hungarian minorities in surrounding countries have
become a major base of support for the Órban government. For instance,
in the Romanian region of Transylvania, there are 1.2 million ethnic
Hungarians, making it one of the largest ethnic minority populations in
Europe. This has created what Tamás Kiss, a researcher at the Romanian
Institute for Research on National Minorities, described as a system of
"ethnic parallelism -- to build up and maintain a system in which
Hungarians can live their life as it would be not in Romania but in
Hungary." Using local proxies in ethnic Hungarian communities in
Slovenia, Serbia, Slovakia, Ukraine, and Romania, Órban has pumped money
into Hungarian-centric media and cultural programs. Akos Keller-Alant, a
Hungarian journalist, describes this strategy as a way to pursue "the
'virtual unification' of all Hungarians," including by making it "easier
for them to gain Hungarian citizenship."

Meanwhile, tensions with Hungary's neighbors have grown. The
[[Órban]{.underline}]{.mark} regime has been quick to stoke resentment
over various perceived slights --- both real and imagined --- within
Hungarian minority populations. This, in turn, has
[provoked]{.underline} a [backlash among Hungary's
neighbors]{.underline}, [exacerbating tensions and]{.underline}
increasing **[anti-Hungarian sentiment]{.underline}**. This gives the
[Órban regime [a]{.mark} **nationalist [dial]{.mark}**]{.underline}, so
to speak, [to [aggravate]{.mark} **territorial [grievances]{.mark}**
[whenever it chooses]{.mark}]{.underline}. With the upheaval and
uncertainty caused by COVID-19, the [ability to distract the
nation]{.underline} from the government's response to the pandemic would
likely become **[increasingly politically appealing]{.underline}**.

Hungary's revanchist allies

While ethnic conflict is not a new feature of central European politics,
several factors --- including Hungary's rapid military modernization and
growing relationships with Russia and China --- make Órban's increasing
nationalistic posture and rhetoric more troubling.

[Órban]{.underline} is [not just stirring the nationalist
pot]{.underline}. [Hungary's]{.underline} movement away from democracy
and [embrace of **autocratic illiberalism**]{.underline} has [helped the
country foster closer [relationships with]{.mark} Russia and
China]{.underline}. [[Russian intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark} has
greatly [expanded its presence]{.underline} in the country, allegedly
using Hungary as a back door to the European Union. Meanwhile,
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} has [built]{.underline} up its economic and
political connections to Budapest, with [a major **[B]{.mark}**elt and
**[R]{.mark}**oad **[I]{.mark}**nitiative project]{.underline} linking
the Hungarian capital to Belgrade. Ultimately, these sorts of actions
benefit all involved parties: [Hungary]{.underline} builds economic and
political [ties with Russia and China]{.underline}, while Russia and
China get the opportunity to not only build ties with a fellow illiberal
regime but also potentially [[undermine]{.mark} the [cohesion]{.mark} of
the EU and **NATO**]{.underline}.

Additionally, both [Russia and China [provide]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[**revanchist [model]{.mark}** [for Hungary]{.mark}]{.underline} to
follow. [[Russia]{.mark} seized [Crimea]{.mark}]{.underline},
[invaded]{.underline} eastern [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and
continues to dispute]{.underline} regions of Georgia under the guise of
protecting ethnic Russian populations. [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
its part, has [[built islands]{.mark} in the **S**outh **C**hina
**S**ea]{.underline}, claiming a loose historical connection.

claims]{.mark}]{.underline}**, similar actions [undertaken by the Órban

both]{.underline}.

#### Hungary will [not]{.underline} change course, even with NATO pressure.

More tangibly, [**recently improved [ties]{.mark}**
[between]{.mark}]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [[Putin and
Orban]{.mark}'s]{.underline} government [present]{.underline} other
[serious problems]{.underline}. At best, [they weaken NATO's **united
front**]{.underline} toward Russia over its actions in Ukraine; at
worst, they [represent a]{.underline} potentially **[[grave]{.mark}
security [risk]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

The [alliance's [reluctance to do much]{.mark} over Hungary [stems
from]{.mark} several factors]{.underline}. First, the
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} treaty [[has **no provisions**
for]{.underline}]{.mark} sanctioning, [[punishing]{.underline}]{.mark}
or expelling [[a]{.mark} member [state]{.mark}]{.underline}. Individual
member states may decide to withdraw from the alliance, but neither NATO
nor any other country can force them to do so.

Second, [NATO has]{.underline} a [long [history of]{.mark} turning
a]{.underline} ~~blind~~ \[**[[ignorance]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] [eye
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} democratic [[backsliding]{.mark} among its
members]{.underline}. [[Greece]{.underline}]{.mark} was [led
by]{.underline} a [military dictatorship]{.underline} from 1967-74, and
[[Turkey]{.mark} experienced military-led coups]{.underline} in 1960 and
1980. And one of its founding members, [[Portugal]{.underline}]{.mark},
was a dictatorship until 1974. In each of these instances, geopolitical
realities --- namely, the Cold War struggle against the Soviet Union ---
trumped concerns over democratic values.

[Even if the alliance]{.underline} treaty [had provisions for
punishing]{.underline} or expelling [a member state]{.underline}, it's
[**very likely** an[other]{.mark} member [state]{.mark}]{.underline}
would [[side with Hungary]{.underline}]{.mark}, [frustrating
consensus]{.underline}. [[**Poland** and **Turkey**]{.mark} come to
mind]{.underline}, given their own struggles with democratic backsliding
in recent years --- and likely concern that they might be shown the
exits next.

Some might [[add to this]{.underline}]{.mark} list [Hungary's
**important [geographic attributes]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [sitting in
the center of Europe]{.underline}, [bordering Ukraine]{.underline}, [and
forming a land bridge from]{.underline} allies in [the south
to]{.underline} those in the [north]{.underline}. Hungary isn't a
geopolitical lynchpin, however. It doesn't compare in this regard to any
of the Baltic States, which sit at the epicenter of strategic
competition in Europe, or to Turkey, with its long Black Sea coastline,
its borders with Iran, Iraq and Syria, and its control of the Bosporus
Strait. And if NATO ever needed to quickly move forces by land between
the Eastern Mediterranean and the Baltics, it could transit Ukraine,
which never has been friendlier toward the West, or Austria, which also
has become closer to NATO.

## Consensus/Say "No"

### 1nc Consensus Fails

#### Consensus requirement wrecks solvency --- [waters down]{.underline} the aff's mandate --- consensus directly [trades off]{.underline} with effectiveness!

//CYang

Organizational structures and processes. This project's focus groups
concluded that [[NATO's **rigid organization**]{.mark}**al processes**
that [hold onto the past]{.mark}]{.underline} could [result
in]{.underline} an [[Alliance]{.underline}]{.mark} "[**[unable to
evolve]{.mark}** with member states' **national
interests**]{.underline}." [Bureaucratic politics]{.underline} within
the Alliance structures could [[cause]{.underline}]{.mark} NATO's [[slow
adaptation]{.mark} to **contemporary needs** and values]{.underline}.
For instance, the participants listed the [top-down defense
planning]{.underline} process of determining capability requirements as
a case where the [Alliance and]{.underline} evolving [national interests
do not align]{.underline}. Furthermore, [[civil-military
frictions]{.underline}]{.mark} on both NATO and national levels could
[negatively affect readiness]{.underline} of the forces.
[**[Long]{.mark} decision-making [processes]{.mark}** and
[underdeveloped institutional procedures]{.mark}]{.underline} in
national headquarters could [[prevent]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Alliance from developing]{.mark} a legal framework for a
[common]{.mark} course of [action]{.mark}]{.underline} under the NATO
flag; [for instance]{.underline}, [[in]{.mark} addressing **[new]{.mark}
adversaries**]{.underline} that use [**unconventional [means]{.mark}**
[such as cyber]{.mark}]{.underline}. Put simply, NATO cannot be faster
than the individual countries that make it up. Lastly, [size
matters]{.underline}; [[cohesion]{.underline}]{.mark} is [more
[difficult]{.mark} to forge and maintain [in]{.mark}]{.underline} an
**[ever-[enlarging alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}**, especially
[when]{.underline} increasingly **[[divergent]{.mark} national
[interests]{.mark}]{.underline}** tend to [change]{.underline} the
[modus operandi of the Alliance]{.underline}. More rather than less
often, [[NATO's]{.underline}]{.mark} international staff will [need to
find **[compromise]{.mark}** during]{.underline} its [decision-making
processes [between]{.mark}]{.underline} a political and formal equality
hoped to enhance Alliance [[cohesion]{.underline}]{.mark} on the one
hand [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the desirable [Alliance
[effectiveness]{.mark}]{.underline} on the other hand.

### 2nc Consensus Fails

#### Consensus-based decision-making fails --- it's outdated.

In this respect, [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} needs to address its
[**outmoded [reliance]{.mark}** on [decision-making by
consensus]{.mark}]{.underline}, which could [become a [recipe
for]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~paralysis~~
\[**[[inaction]{.underline}]{.mark}**\]. Precisely because its [[member
states have]{.underline}]{.mark} such [a [wide array of
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[fears]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
[[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}
is [[more likely to take]{.mark}]{.underline} effective and timely
[[action through coalitions of the willing]{.underline}]{.mark},
[not]{.underline} by **[unanimous consent]{.underline}**. For the same
reason, provisions may be necessary to isolate or suspend the privileges
of recalcitrant members. Accordingly, NATO should move toward a more
flexible system of decision-making. Russian membership would help drive
home the importance of updating NATO\'s institutions and decision-making
procedures.

[**bilateral issues** that impede progress on **collective
issues**]{.mark}]{.underline} of the Alliance. As an example, an

a]{.mark} NATO [partner]{.mark}]{.underline} who wishes to participate
in an exercise.48 [This]{.underline} practice [erodes Alliance
cohesion]{.underline} and should not be permitted. After appropriate
consultation, we recommend the Secretary General should have the
authority to exclude such external issues from consideration in the
Alliance, even if it means moving forward without full consensus.

[[NATO]{.mark} has **finessing mechanisms** that]{.underline} can [help
[circumvent]{.mark} the **[unanimity]{.mark} rule**]{.underline} on
occasion, [but all of them are **thin reeds**]{.underline} to rely upon
in today's world. [One]{.underline} such mechanism [is the]{.underline}
"**[silence procedure]{.underline}**," [[whereby a member]{.mark} who
disagrees with a **widespread consensus**]{.underline} chooses to
[[abstain]{.underline}]{.mark} from voting, [thereby allowing the
consensus]{.underline} to carry the day. Another mechanism is to shift
decisionmaking from the NAC to the Defense Planning Committee (DPC).
This allows NATO to make decisions without France, which belongs to the
NAC but not the DPC. A third mechanism is for the Secretary General to
claim to speak for a unanimous consensus without taking a formal vote.
This mechanism was employed in the Kosovo war and helped enable NATO to
conduct military operations even though some members had misgivings. A
fourth mechanism is that SACEUR and other commanders can prepare
informal defense plans.

The problem with these finessing mechanisms is that
[[they]{.underline}]{.mark} only work sometimes and [can
**[easily]{.mark} be [overturned]{.mark}** [by]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[[small **number of members** intent on having their
way]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such [members]{.underline} can [[refuse to
stay silent]{.underline}]{.mark}, can [insist the [NAC]{.mark} be
used]{.underline}, can [[deny the **S**]{.mark}ecretary
**[G]{.mark}**eneral]{.underline} the [[authority]{.mark} to speak for
NATO]{.underline}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[block]{.mark}
military commanders from **[planning]{.mark} informally**]{.underline}.

### 2nc AT US Solves

#### US pressure is a [neg warrant]{.underline} --- it makes consensus [LESS]{.underline} likely.

**Michel '14** --- Leo; Distinguished Research Fellow in the Center for

'Consensus Rule' Endures Despite Challenges"; NATO's Post-Cold War
Politics; Accessed Online via University of Michigan Libraries; //CYang

The Secretary General aids consensus-building through informal
discussions at NATO headquarters with individual allies or groups of
allies. He also can influence alliance deliberations through his public
statements, private meetings, and correspondence with senior officials,
legislators, or opinion [[**leaders** of **allied
governments**]{.underline}]{.mark} (see Mayer and Theiler and
Hendrickson, this volume).3 However, the [Secretary General]{.underline}
and other [NATO officials [cannot overrule]{.mark} an [ally's
position]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [[any **perceived
effort**]{.mark} by the Secretary General or]{.underline} other [NATO
officials [to run roughshod over **any ally's**
objections]{.mark}]{.underline} is apt to [[provoke]{.mark}
**sympathetic [objections]{.mark}** [from **other**]{.mark} **allied
[representatives]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[since]{.underline}]{.mark}
the latter are [wary of **[any precedent]{.mark}** that [could
diminish]{.mark} their [future prerogatives]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### 2nc AT Fiat Solves

#### Fiat is a neg warrant --- the [process]{.underline} will make the outcome fail.

Council. April 27, 2020; "AI\'s Impact on Multilateral Military
Cooperation: Experience from NATO?"; *AJIL Unbound*, Volume 114;
Accessed Online via University of Michigan Libraries; //CYang

While the use of AI in both these contexts could potentially increase
the speed and quality of multinational military cooperation, it clearly
also can pose difficulties. For example, [[increasing
speed]{.underline}]{.mark} could be [[perceived as]{.mark} fueling
pressure for **[inappropriately accelerated]{.mark}**
action]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} kind of [acceleration of usual
processes]{.underline} might be [perceived as going
[against]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[normal]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [NATO
[decision-making]{.mark} in a number of ways]{.underline}: it might be
seen as [[evading]{.underline}]{.mark} the [political control exercised
by [the **N**]{.mark}orth **[A]{.mark}**tlantic
**[C]{.mark}**ouncil]{.underline}, [[overriding]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[consensus]{.mark} decision-making]{.underline} that applied within the
Alliance, being [[susceptible to **misinterpretation** or]{.mark} being
[seen as **escalatory**]{.mark} **in nature**]{.underline}, or otherwise
[[leading to **unpredictable results**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In an
extreme case, [[Allies]{.underline}]{.mark} might see these situations
as inconsistent with NATO's collective defense mandate. This might
[result in a **[backlash]{.mark} against**]{.underline} the [use of
AI-enabled military applications]{.underline}, precisely at a time when
the Alliance needs to maintain an edge with them. In other words, as
with many issues involved in multinational military cooperation, the
problem may ultimately boil down to one of trust.

## No Solve Cohesion

### 1nc Laundry List

#### NATO is [falling apart]{.underline} -- political divides, US military dependence, disorganized command structure, and ineffective war planning mean it [won't be fixed]{.underline}

**Lucas '22** -- Nonresident fellow at the Center for European Policy
Analysis, a Liberal Democratic candidate for the British Parliament, a
former senior editor at The Economist, and the author, most recently, of
Cyberphobia: Identity, Trust, Security and the Internet (Edward, Foreign
Policy, "NATO Is Out of Shape and Out of Date", June 7, 2022,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/06/07/nato-ukraine-russia-war-alliance-reform-geopolitics-military/>
)//RG

[Yet look a little more closely, and the picture is far less rosy.
Notwithstanding its apparent unity of purpose since the start of
Russia's war, **NATO looks out of shape and out of
date**]{.underline}**.** In the run-up to their summit, [the allies have
been **furiously haggling** over the language in their new strategic
concept, which will frame the]{.underline} alliance's [mission for the
coming years]{.underline} and will be unveiled in Madrid. What will it
say about Russia? About China? What sacrifices and risks are the member
states really willing to accept? Are they willing to pool sovereignty in
order to streamline decision-making? [Nothing]{.underline} in recent
weeks [suggests]{.underline} that these [questions will get clear
answers]{.underline}. For starters, [the 30-strong alliance is unwieldy.
In military terms, only a handful of members matter]{.underline}---above
all, the United States---[but in political terms, even little Luxembourg
and Iceland get a voice. Worse, **the political divides are huge.**
Turkey]{.underline} under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan [is a
semi-authoritarian state that flirts with Russia and fumes
at]{.underline} what it considers [European meddling over human
rights.]{.underline} [Hungary]{.underline} under Prime Minister Viktor
Orban [is taking a]{.underline} different but [downward
path]{.underline}, fusing wealth and power into a new system of control
at home and undermining U.S. and European attempts to put pressure on
Russia and China. [Macron's]{.underline} relentless
[posturing]{.underline} and German Chancellor Olaf [Scholz's
foot-dragging create **constant obstacles and
distractions**]{.underline}. The two leader's weaknesses, on glorious
display since the start of the war, have already enriched the language:
Scholzen is a German neologism for "dither," while makronic in Polish
(and its equivalent in Ukrainian) can be roughly translated as "vacuous
grandstanding while doing nothing**."** [Macron and Scholz **corrode
decision-making** with their foibles and thus **place a big question
mark over the alliance's credibility and cohesion**. Any]{.underline}
threat or [provocation from Russia is unlikely to be clear or
conveniently timed]{.underline}. More likely [it will be something
deliberately ambiguous]{.underline}, such as a Russian drone that
"accidentally" strays onto the territory of a front-line state and hits
a target. [Some countries would favor a tough response. Others would
fear escalation and want dialogue.]{.underline} Still [others would take
the ambiguity as a convenient excuse to do nothing. Would the
30]{.underline}---soon to be 32---national [representatives]{.underline}
in the North Atlantic Council, the alliance's deliberative body, [really
make a speedy and tough decision]{.underline} on how to react? [More
likely, some of them would plead for delay, diplomacy, and compromise.
Those]{.underline} actually [facing the possibility of attack would
be]{.underline} far [more hawkish, preferring a sharp military
confrontation]{.underline} to even the smallest Russian victory. "Not
one inch, not one soul," a senior military figure from one of the Baltic
states, speaking anonymously, told me. "We have seen what they did in
Ukraine." The **[political weaknesses are matched by military
ones]{.underline}**. By far the most important country in the alliance
is the United States. The [U.S. security guarantee]{.underline} to
Europe---with its threat of devastating conventional and, if necessary,
nuclear response to any attack---[is the cornerstone of the
alliance]{.underline}. "All for one and one for all" sounds fine, but
nobody in the Kremlin will tremble at the thought of Spanish, Dutch, or
Canadian displeasure. Yet [the result of this is a colossal dependence
on U.S. capabilities]{.underline}, ranging from ammunition and spare
parts (of which European countries' stockpiles are notoriously skinny)
to military transports that move forces quickly and efficiently over
long distances. Even if [Europe's new defense spending
plans]{.underline} materialize, they [will not change the fact that only
U.S. armed forces can move with the scale and speed necessary to defend
territory from]{.underline} a country like [Russia]{.underline}.
Conversely, the [countries that most need
defending]{.underline}---Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania---[are the least
able to bear the burden]{.underline} themselves. They need advanced
weapons, particularly for air and missile defense, that they cannot
afford themselves. The thin neck of land along the Polish-Lithuanian
border, the so-called Suwalki Gap, is particularly vulnerable to attack
from Russia's militarized Kaliningrad exclave and Belarus, from which
Russia attacked Ukraine. Poland and Lithuania both want a big U.S.
military presence---either a permanent base or a persistent rotation of
forces---to safeguard this strategic chokepoint. [Yet NATO command
structures]{.underline} and planning [do not fully reflect the imbalance
of forces]{.underline} between the United States and Europe. [They rely
on the **fiction** that the European allies are]{.underline} more or
less [equal partners]{.underline}. Even military lightweights need to
have important-sounding jobs and installations, making the North
Atlantic Council the military version of a parliament dividing out the
pork. **[The resulting command structure is like a tangled pile of
spaghetti]{.underline}**. In the Baltic region alone, [NATO has several
multinational headquarters]{.underline}, one divisional headquarters
split between Latvia and Denmark, another divisional headquarters in
Poland, and a corps headquarters at a different location in Poland.
[Overall responsibility]{.underline} for the defense of Europe [is
divided between three Joint Forces Command headquarters]{.underline} in
Naples, Italy; Brunssum, the Netherlands; and Norfolk, Virginia. But the
top U.S. military commander in Europe, Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, is
based at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe in Mons, Belgium. A
[maritime strategy for the Baltic Sea region has yet to be
decided]{.underline}---which is just as well, becau[se NATO has yet to
create a naval headquarters for the region. Nor has the alliance drawn
up]{.underline} real [military plans for the]{.underline} reinforcement
and [defense of its northeastern members, let alone decided who
would]{.underline} actually [provide the forces]{.underline} and
equipment in order to make them credible. Military mobility is meant to
be the responsibility of Joint Support and Enabling Command,
headquartered in Ulm, Germany, and originally set up as part of the
European Union's own defense policy. [A further problem is
exercises:]{.underline} [NATO does not conduct fully realistic,
large-scale rehearsals of how it would respond to a Russian
attack.]{.underline} One problem is that these are costly and
disruptive. Another is that they expose the huge weaknesses of some NATO
members, which can cope with a carefully scripted exercise but lack the
ability to improvise. A third reason is the fear, in some countries,
that practicing war-fighting would be provocative. [Also lacking are
detailed plans for fighting a war against Russia,]{.underline} covering
such issues as reinforcing of front-line states, countering a Russian
attack, regaining any temporarily occupied territory, [and---most of
all---dealing with a nuclear or other escalation.]{.underline} As a
result, [nobody is]{.underline} quite [sure how anything would work in a
crisis.]{.underline} Instead, another assumption reigns: that [in a
crisis, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would take over
and do the heavy lifting on all fronts]{.underline}---logistics,
intelligence, and combat. To be fair, NATO is working on [these
problems]{.underline}, and [all of them are fixable. But **that does not
mean**]{.underline} that **[they are anywhere near being fixed. Wishful
thinking remains the alliance's besetting sin.]{.underline}** Worse,
[NATO is unprepared for the changing nature of modern
warfare]{.underline}. Russia's old-style assault on Ukraine is all too
familiar. But the artillery bombardments and missile strikes that are
grinding down Ukraine's defenses are only part of the
[Kremlin's]{.underline} arsenal. Its [most effective weapons are
nonmilitary]{.underline}: subversion, diplomatic divide-and-rule
tactics, economic coercion, corruption, and propaganda. The most burning
current example of nonmilitary warfare is Russia's weaponizing of
hunger. By blocking Ukraine's grain exports, Russia has raised the
specter of famine over millions of people, including in volatile and
fragile countries in North Africa and the Middle East. Mass starvation
is not just a humanitarian catastrophe, but its consequences include
political unrest and mass migration, a direct threat to Europe. [Yet
NATO is ill-equipped to deal with this.]{.underline} It cannot mandate
more economical use of grain---for example, by feeding less to livestock
and stopping grain's conversion to fuel. It has no food stockpiles to
release to a hungry world. It cannot build new railways to ship
Ukrainian grain through other routes. Nor can it insure merchant vessels
that might---for a price---be willing to run Russia's Black Sea
blockade. NATO has little in-house expertise in countering Russian
disinformation and almost zero influence in African and other countries
susceptible to Kremlin narratives blaming the West for the food
shortages that are already starting now. [NATO could acquire these
capabilities]{.underline}. Or it could regain them: During the Cold War,
the alliance had an economic warfare division and ran a program called
the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls to prevent
the Soviet bloc from acquiring sensitive technologies. But in the
strategic timeout that followed the collapse of the Soviet bloc, these
agencies and their skill sets shriveled and died. [But]{.underline} as
with NATO's military shortcomings, [identifying the problems is not the
same as solving them. And given the bloc's unwieldy structure and issues
with key members, **it might be wise to lower expectations about NATO**
returning to]{.underline} Cold War levels of [consistent readiness and
effectiveness.]{.underline} A more realistic vision for the alliance
would be to treat it as a framework for the most capable and
threat-aware members to form coalitions of the willing. These groupings
already exist: The British-led Joint Expeditionary Force, for example,
is a 10-country framework for military cooperation, chiefly aimed at
enabling very rapid deployments to the Nordic-Baltic region in the event
of a crisis. France has a similar venture, the European Intervention
Initiative. The five Nordic states have their own military club, called
the Nordic Defence Cooperation, while Poland has close bilateral ties
with Lithuania. A similar network of bilateral and multilateral ties
would greatly strengthen the alliance's floundering presence in the
Black Sea and other regions, including North Africa and the Eastern
Mediterranean. These groupings would not supplant NATO but improve
action and interoperability on top of the alliance's established
structures and mechanisms. [The difficult and underlying
question]{.underline} here [is the role of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. [Europe is, in theory, big and rich enough to
manage its own defense. But its persistent political weakness prevents
that.]{.underline} [The paradox is that only U.S. involvement makes NATO
credible]{.underline}---[yet overdependence on the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [also undermines the alliance's credibility, while
stoking resentment]{.underline} in France and elsewhere. [The task for
Washington is to encourage European allies to shoulder more of the
burden and start thinking strategically again]{.underline}, even as it
retains the superpower involvement that gives the alliance its decisive
military edge. [That is entirely doable**. But don't expect it to
happen**]{.underline} in Madrid---or **[anytime soon.]{.underline}**

It has been [**[clear]{.mark}** since [NATO's]{.mark}
founding]{.underline} that [what the [alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}
purports to [stand for [and]{.mark} what]{.underline} certain [[member
states]{.mark} practice]{.underline}, [[do not]{.underline}]{.mark}
always **[fully [align]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It has certainly not been
lost on those skeptical of or hostile to the alliance --- within or
without --- that [[authoritarian regimes]{.underline}]{.mark} have come
to power [in several member states]{.underline} and that they have begun
to erode, if not **[[outright contradict]{.underline}]{.mark}**, many of
the [[core principles]{.mark} NATO]{.underline} was [designed to defend
and promote]{.underline}. At the same time, some of the member states in
question remain of crucial importance to the alliance's security
interests. From the beginning in 1949, [[when]{.mark} treaty [values
and]{.mark} strategic [imperatives]{.mark}]{.underline} have been
[[conflicted]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [strategic
[imperatives]{.mark}]{.underline} have almost
[[always]{.underline}]{.mark}, albeit temporarily on an 'exceptional'
basis, [[taken **precedence**]{.mark} over the values]{.underline}. In
the beginning, the [**dominance** of strategic
considerations]{.underline} over values was [demonstrated when
[Portugal]{.mark}]{.underline}, under its autocratic regime, was
[invited to sign]{.underline} the treaty. Its [[Azores]{.mark}
airfields]{.underline} would have been [critical to American
reinforcement]{.underline} of NATO forces in wartime. However,
value-based opposition from European founding members blocked dictator
Francisco Franco's Spain, despite strongly-held views of U.S. Se NATOrs,
including leading NATO skeptic Robert Taft, who thought military
resources of Spain and Germany would add importantly to NATO's defenses
against the Soviet Union. The point was recorded in Senate Resolution 99
when it passed the Senate in 1951.4 While not new, these
[[tensions]{.underline}]{.mark} today [are [**greater** than

[is [not the **only**]{.mark} **worrying [development]{.mark}** observed
in]{.underline} the [politics of NATO states]{.underline} over the past
decade. The [growth of European **radical right [populist]{.mark}**

[by]{.underline} the tragic [flood of [refugees]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Rising populism will only continue to exacerbate divides among member states

[Political and economic factors]{.underline}. The group of political and
economic factors [points to]{.underline} the risks of [**severe
[disagreements]{.mark}** among the allies]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} could [lead to]{.underline} the [[weaken]{.mark}ing
of]{.underline} the [[transatlantic bond]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[disintegration]{.underline}]{.mark} tendencies within the European
Union, [[or]{.mark} **even [withdrawal]{.mark}** of a NATO nation from
the Alliance]{.underline}. At the level of political elites, the
participants identified the crisis of political leadership in NATO
nations among the most probable causes of weakening alliance cohesion in
the future. Particularly, [[populist leaders who prefer]{.mark}
narrow]{.underline}, [short-term political [gains at
home]{.mark}]{.underline} and who are prepared to "undermine an
international institution to gain consensus internally"
[[represent]{.mark} a **[serious threat]{.mark}** to
multilateralism]{.underline}, on which the Alliance has depended.
Oftentimes, national leaders "[use [NATO]{.mark} as [a
**scapegoat**]{.mark} for]{.underline} their [domestic political
games]{.underline}," while "NATO does not \[and cannot\] fight its own
nations." At the level of [[domestic]{.mark} population]{.underline},
the [[support]{.mark} for]{.underline} the [Alliance in member
states]{.underline} can [[decline due to]{.mark} NATO's **[unclear
purpose]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This could become an acute problem,
especially if national leaders continue to frame security problems
exclusively in domestic terms instead of treating them as NATO-wide.
Particularly, concerns over sovereignty could override the relative
value of the Alliance's collective good and [make governments
pull]{.underline} limited funds **[away from NATO]{.underline}**. In a
similar vein, [demographic shifts changing]{.underline} the
socioeconomic and cultural fabric of nations, such as an
[**[aging]{.mark} population** and [migration]{.mark}]{.underline}, will
[drive differences in fiscal priorities]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} could [[result in decreasing]{.mark} **national
defense [spending]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Furthermore, if the
[free-riding behavior reaches **critical proportions** within
NATO]{.underline} burden sharing, it can create, out of those who bear
their fair share, a group of allies disinterested in defending
free-riding nations, as they could cease to see "return on their
investment."

### 2nc Threat Perception

#### Diverging threat perception makes it impossible to create joint policies or allocate resources

US security guarantees for Europe. [Threat perception is an absolute
classic in European defense debates: the question of against what or
whom Europe needs to be defended. Diverging threat perceptions translate
into different and even incompatible views on what policies the Alliance
should adopt regarding certain key issues, notably in its relationship
with Russia]{.underline} as the single most important issue for
Euro-Atlantic security in the 21st century. Moreover, [given that threat
perception requires translation into defense planning, this is also a
debate about allocating capabilities and defining priorities in light of
scarce resources]{.underline}. Most important in the context of threat
perception is how Europeans should deal with Russia, notably in a wider
vision of Euro-Atlantic security.

#### European threat perception differences make compromise impossible

Security Policy at the University of Hamburg. She specializes in
European security and the debates surrounding it, with a special

[[The principal factor explaining divergences among European nations is
threat perception]{.mark}. Enumerations of threats and risks
in]{.underline} various national [strategy documents certainly look very
similar at first glance]{.underline}, just as Europeans regularly manage
to agree on listings of threats and challenges in joint documents such
as the 2016 European Union Global Strategy or NATO Summit Declarations[.
However, divergences pertain to the prioritization and urgency of these
threats. In light of scarce resources,]{.underline} in particular in
smaller European countries, it seems almost self-evident that a genuine
360-degree approach taking into account all threats that would backed up
by actual defense planning and allocated resources is hardly feasible.
The usual enumerations are therefore primarily a rhetorical compromise
and mere juxtapositions of threats that say little about actual
prioritization. In reality, **[[European states hold very different
views on what priorities should be and what both national and
multinational defense planning and procurement should focus
on.]{.mark}]{.underline}** While this categorization obviously lacks
sophistication, [European [states can roughly be divided into two
ideal-typical camps. The first]{.mark} one [is]{.mark} composed of those
[countries that consider Russia the main threat to the continent's
security. This]{.mark}]{.underline} [first [group primarily consists of
the northern and eastern]{.underline}]{.mark} [European
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline}, i.e., [[the so-called Eastern
flank]{.mark}. Germany]{.underline} also belongs to this group, at least
on paper (as illustrated, for example, by the 2018 Conception of the
Bundeswehr which switched the official focus back to territorial
defense17), although concerns about Russia are much less pronounced
there than, for example, in the Baltic states or in Poland. [The
U]{.underline}nited [K]{.underline}ingdom [and the Netherlands are part
of it, too]{.underline}. [[The second camp looks primarily to the south
and sees the greatest challenges in (Islamist)
terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}, inter alia [resulting in high levels
of]{.underline} political [instability in regions such as West Africa.
[The most prominent representative of this camp is]{.mark}]{.underline}
undoubtedly [[France, but Italy and Spain also share many of the French
views]{.underline}]{.mark}.18 [These two main categories of
threats---Russia and terrorism---are the most relevant dividing line in
Europe's defense debate]{.underline}. Transnational threats such as
climate change or the risk of pandemics are also part of contemporary
discourses but are less controversial. The key explanation for this is
the fact that primarily the former two require translation into
capability requirements in defense planning (such as the NATO Defense
Planning Process, NDPP) and thus the allocation of (considerable) means
and prioritizations in acquisition decisions. In comparison, the actual
military and defense planning implications of, for example, climate
change are negligible. Russia and terrorism as main threats, in turn,
clearly shape defense planning, military policies, and procurement
decisions. They also shape attitudes and expectations vis-à-vis NATO and
the EU's defense activities within the framework of the Common Security
and Defense Policy (CSDP). Europeans themselves are increasingly aware
of these divergences in threat perception and the problems they cause.
It is for this reason that the European Union's latest strategy process,
the Strategic Compass (launched under the German EU presidency during
the second half of 2020 and due to be completed under the French
presidency during the first half of 2022)19 started with a first phase
on threat assessment. The result is an unpublished report based on input
from EU member states' intelligence agencies (and not governments, in
order to 'depoliticize' the document) that details the threats and
challenges the EU will likely face in the five to ten years to come.
Yet, [[because threat perceptions are at the heart of defense policies
and are not suitable for compromise, it seems unlikely that the
Strategic Compass---or any other strategy process or document---will
truly overcome intra-European divides that are structural in
nature]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Threat perception debate has toxified the alliance

**Kunz 2021**

Barbra, senior researcher at the Institute for Peace Research and
Security Policy at the University of Hamburg. She specializes in
European security and the debates surrounding it, with a special
emphasis on France and Germany. "'There is No "Europe': Disagreements

Beyond, (157-176), 2021.dmr

It would, however, be erroneous to solely limit the analysis of
disagreements among NATO members to the actions of Turkey as the current
'problematic ally.' Even [[**Western European Allies sometimes hold
positions that are incompatible with each other**. Key disagreements
pertain to threat perception]{.mark} and hence defense priorities [as
well as to the likelihood of continued US security guarantees**. These
disagreements run deep**]{.mark}]{.underline}---sometimes so deep that
they are not always visible at the surface level of every-day policy
issues. Yet, they clearly shape positions, as a closer look at the
ongoing European defense debate reveals. In past years, [many important
aspects of this debate revolved around the notion of European strategic
autonomy]{.underline}. Long known and used in a French national
context,14 the 2016 European Union Global Strategy lifted "strategic
autonomy" to the European level. The document "nurtures the ambition of
strategic autonomy for the European Union," but does not provide a
concise definition of the notion's content or implication.15 **[[The
ensuing]{.mark}]{.underline}** and at times **[[heated debate among
Europeans]{.underline}]{.mark}** was not particularly enlightening at
the conceptual level and **[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** today considered
**[[in need of being "detoxified."]{.underline}]{.mark}**16 Yet, the
debate has offered many meta-level insights into the various national
approaches to European security and defense. Two variables are key in
this context: threat perception and assessments of the likely future of
US security guarantees for Europe. Threat perception is an absolute
classic in European defense debates: the question of against what or
whom Europe needs to be defended. **[[Diverging threat perceptions
translate into different and even incompatible views on what policies
the Alliance should adopt]{.mark}]{.underline}** regarding certain key
issues, notably in its relationship with Russia as the single most
important issue for Euro-Atlantic security in the 21st century.
Moreover, given that threat perception requires translation into defense
planning, [this is also a debate about allocating capabilities and
defining priorities in light of scarce resources.]{.underline} Most
important in the context of threat perception is how Europeans should
deal with Russia, notably in a wider vision of Euro-Atlantic security.
The second variable pertains to the United States and its engagement in
European security. Here, the key question is that of the mid- and
long-term reliability of US security guarantees and the conclusions
Europeans need to draw for their own security cooperation, which, in
turn, has ramifications for NATO. In both the EU and NATO contexts, as
well as at national levels, Europeans have in recent years acknowledged
on numerous occasions that their security environment is deteriorating.
The conclusions drawn from this observation, as well as how to explain
its causes, however, vary widely across the continent.

[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} is [**[uncharacteristically
divided]{.mark}** on how to deal with]{.underline} Russia in the
escalating crisis over [Ukraine]{.underline}. \"The [[US
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[UK]{.mark} favor]{.underline} deterrence
and [a [hard line]{.mark}]{.underline}; [[Germany]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[France]{.mark} and [Italy]{.mark}]{.underline} are [emphasizing
[dialogue]{.mark}]{.underline}, and a third group, including
[[Bulgaria]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Hungary]{.underline}]{.mark} and
[[Slovakia]{.underline}]{.mark}, [wants to [stay out]{.mark}
of]{.underline} the [conflict]{.underline} and any troop deployment,\"
says Stefan Meister, an expert on Russia and eastern Europe at the
German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP). He told DW that, while
[[Germany]{.underline}]{.mark} is [usually the moderate
link]{.underline} between these groups, that link is [**currently
[missing]{.mark}** because of weak leadership]{.underline}. He warns
that, in addition, [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} is [**[already
weak]{.mark}ened** by [populism]{.mark}]{.underline},
[Trump]{.underline}, and [Brexit]{.underline}. \"Russia\'s President
Vladimir Putin is trying to exploit this to negotiate a new security
order in Europe -- without the United States,\" he explains. And in this
situation, the [NATO countries of southeastern Europe have]{.underline}
an [**unusually important** role]{.underline} to play.
[[Croatia]{.underline}]{.mark}: \'[If it escalates]{.underline},
[retreat]{.underline}\'? However, there are some
**[strident]{.underline}**, [and conflicting]{.underline}, [voices
making themselves heard]{.underline} in the region. At the end of
January, the president of Croatia, Zoran [Milanovic]{.underline}, caused
[confusion]{.underline} both at home and abroad when he
[[declared]{.underline}]{.mark} that, [in the event of]{.underline} a
[conflict]{.underline} in Ukraine, [his country would
[retreat]{.mark}]{.underline}. Speaking in the Croatian capital, Zagreb,
Milanovic said: \"If it comes to an escalation, we will withdraw, down
to the last Croatian soldier.\" He did not, however, specify exactly
what he meant. There are no Croatian soldiers stationed in Ukraine. The
[government of Croatia]{.underline} --- a member of both the EU and NATO
--- [immediately issued]{.underline} a **[[contradictory]{.mark}
statement]{.underline}**. \"The president does not speak for Croatia,
but for himself,\" said the Croatian foreign minister, Gordan Grlic
Radman. \"We are and remain a loyal member of NATO.\" What is most
peculiar about the Croatian president\'s threat is that no one --- not
NATO, not the US, not Ukraine --- had requested the Croatian military\'s
involvement. \"Milanovic\'s statements serve domestic political
purposes. They have to be seen against the background of his ongoing
feud with Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic,\" explained Filip Milacic of
the Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Vienna, in an interview with DW.
\"Lately, the president seems to be playing the nationalist card. He has
called Milorad Dodik, the Bosnian Serb leader, a \'partner,\' and he
wants to pander to Croatian nationalists, who dream of redrawing the
borders in Bosnia, with Russian support.\"
[[Bulgaria]{.underline}]{.mark}: History as [a]{.underline}
\'**[[lobby]{.mark}ist]{.underline}**\' [[for
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} In an appearance on Bulgarian television BTV
on February 1, 2022, Russian ambassador Eleonora [Mitrofanova
made]{.underline} it [**very clear** what Russia is demanding of
NATO]{.underline}: that it withdraw behind the borders of states that
were members of the organization in 1997. This would require NATO to
withdraw all its troops from countries like Romania and Bulgaria and
close its bases there. [Mitrofanova said]{.underline} that these
[[countries]{.underline}]{.mark} could [[formally]{.underline}]{.mark}
remain [NATO [members]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[but **only
formally**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Bulgaria\'s defense minister, Stefan
[Yanev]{.underline}, is apparently comfortable with the idea. In
December 2021 he was publicly reprimanded by the prime minister, Kiril
Petkov, after he [[spoke out]{.underline}]{.mark} on Facebook
[[against]{.underline}]{.mark} the [redeployment of [NATO]{.mark} troops
to Bulgaria]{.underline}. In a parliamentary hearing the following
month, Yanev then declared: \"[We should stop reading the foreign
press]{.underline} and speculating. [We should]{.underline} be
bulgarophiles, and [think in terms of **Bulgarian national
interests**]{.underline}.\" If any NATO troops were to be stationed in
Bulgaria, he said, they should be exclusively Bulgarian. There is a
[domestic political background to]{.underline} the [[emphasis
on]{.underline}]{.mark} \"[national interests]{.underline}\" in
Bulgaria, too. In December 2021, the [[nationalist Rebirth]{.mark}
party]{.underline} entered parliament, and since then it has been
[putting pressure on the government]{.underline}. The ambassador
Eleonora Mitrofanova is well aware of Bulgarian nationalists\'
[[traditionally **pro-Russian**]{.mark} **sympathies**]{.underline}.
\"[Russia has]{.underline} an [influence in Bulgaria]{.underline}: our
common history,\" she says. \"That is [the **most important**
lobbyist]{.underline}, the [most important influencer in our
relations]{.underline}.\" Romania: 60% approval The situation in Romania
is quite different. Along with Germany and Poland, it is one of the
countries to which additional US and NATO troops are already being
deployed. According to a survey by the INSCOP Research polling
institute, of all the countries in the region, Romania is the one where
NATO enjoys the highest level of trust among the population.
\"Additional NATO troops are not just welcome, they\'re also a political
asset for the government,\" Sorin Ionita, a political scientist at the
Expert Group think tank in Bucharest, told DW. \"Not even the
nationalists dare to speak out against it.\"
[[Hungary]{.underline}]{.mark}: \'**[[Putin\'s
pinscher]{.underline}]{.mark}**\' [in Budapest]{.underline} Hungary is
also a focus for NATO troop deployments, since, like Romania, it shares
a border with Ukraine. Prime Minister Viktor [Orban]{.underline} has
[maintained]{.underline} a \"**[special relationship]{.underline}**\"
[with Russia]{.underline} for years. His [public admiration
for]{.underline} President [Putin]{.underline}, and rejection of
sanctions against his regime, have [earned him]{.underline} the
[nickname]{.underline} \"[Putin\'s pinscher]{.underline}.\" A few days
ago, at the start of February 2022, [Orban traveled to
Moscow]{.underline} on what he called a \"peace mission.\" However, the
main issues under discussion were actually supplies of Russian gas,
which Hungary buys at well below market value, and Russian involvement
in the expansion of the Paks nuclear power plant. Consequently,
[Budapest]{.underline} is [[avoiding **any**]{.mark} **discussion** of
Hungary **getting more involved** in [NATO
activities]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Turkey]{.underline}: [A]{.underline}
\'[delicate balancing act]{.underline}\' Turkey is a strategically
important NATO member that also has a particularly complex relationship
with Russia. [[Putin and]{.underline}]{.mark} President Recep Tayyip
[[Erdogan]{.underline}]{.mark} are [[cooperating]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the Syrian civil war, but in Libya they support different groups.
[Erdogan]{.underline} first [snubbed]{.underline} his [NATO]{.underline}
partners [by buying Russian S-400]{.underline} air defense missiles --
then Ankara supplied Ukraine with military drones. Like Germany,
Hungary, and Bulgaria, Turkey is also dependent on Russian gas and oil.
\"[It\'s a **delicate balancing act** for Ankara]{.underline},\" says
Asli Aydintasbas of the European Council on Foreign Relations.
\"[Erdogan]{.underline} has a special connection with Ukraine, and will
support both it and NATO. On the other hand, he [**[mustn\'t anger
Putin]{.mark}** so much that he turns off]{.underline} the
[gas]{.underline}, [or seeks **revenge in Syria**]{.underline}.\"
[Western [Balkans]{.mark}]{.underline}: Putin and the nationalist elites
\"[Putin [knows]{.mark} **exactly [what he wants]{.mark}** in eastern
Europe]{.underline} -- unlike the West,\" the British eastern Europe
expert Timothy Garton Ash comments in the Guardian newspaper. \"He wants
to restore as much as possible of the empire, great power status and
sphere of influence that Russia lost so dramatically 30 years ago, with
the disintegration of the Soviet Union.\" [In southeastern]{.underline}
Europe, the [Kremlin aims to achieve this by]{.underline} means of
[[cheap gas]{.mark} and [nationalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Filip Milacic
of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation adds: \"[Russia]{.underline} is also
[[offering]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**nationalist elites**
in]{.underline} the [western Balkans something the West is
not]{.underline} offering, and should not offer: [the promise of
[redrawing]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[borders]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the region.\"

#### Divergent threats and priorities undermine cohesion

International Security Affairs in the Office of the Secretary of Defense
for Policy at the U.S. Department of Defense. July-August 2018; "NATO\'s
Enemies Within: How Democratic Decline Could Destroy the Alliance";
*Foreign Affairs*, Volume 97, Number 4;

As if on cue, [**[border disputes]{.mark}** and **simmering [ethnic
conflicts]{.mark}** in eastern Europe]{.underline} began to
[[threaten]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[peace]{.underline}]{.mark} almost
[immediately after]{.underline} the [fall of the Soviet
Union]{.underline}. And with the disintegration of Yugoslavia in the
early 1990s, they ultimately broke it. In the face of these challenges,
NATO sought to leverage the desire for membership to encourage political
reforms by requiring that new members meet its standards for good
governance. This decision was based on the belief that liberal
institutions, practices, and values would prevent a return to the
nationalist, nativist, extremist, and intolerant dynamics that had
driven destructive conflicts in Europe for centuries. To foster security
within Europe, NATO required that new members leave autocratic practices
behind. [Fulfilling]{.underline} these
[[requirements]{.underline}]{.mark} was often **[[politically
contentious]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and **aspiring members** did not
always succeed]{.underline}. Countries that had spent decades under
authoritarian communist rule had to root out the lingering influence of
intelligence agencies, overturn politicized control of the military in
favor of apolitical professional defense forces, establish legislative
oversight for military procurement, and implement personnel policies
that would combat corruption. All of that has taken time:
[[Montenegro]{.underline}]{.mark} set the goal of achieving [membership
in 2007]{.underline} but [had to [wait **ten**]{.mark} **more
[years]{.mark}**]{.underline} to earn admission. And mere aspiration is
not enough: [[Bosnia]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, has [[yet
to]{.mark} fulfill]{.underline} the [criteria]{.underline} that the
alliance set in 2010 for the country to [[be granted]{.mark} the
**[M]{.mark}**embership **[A]{.mark}**ction
**[P]{.mark}**lan]{.underline}, a procedural precursor to joining. These
[requirements]{.underline} may have [slowed the process of NATO\'s
expansion]{.underline}, but liberal institutions and practices are
central to creating security and trust among Europe\'s diverse
societies. Anything less would have weakened the alliance instead of
strengthening it. Beyond its stabilizing effect on the broader
continent, there is another reason NATO\'s liberal democratic character
came to matter: in the absence of a shared external threat, the binding
force of liberal democratic values and institutions has become essential
to the alliance\'s effectiveness. NATO\'s ability to conduct security
operations depends on its political cohesion as much as its members\'
military capabilities. Few question NATO\'s cohesion when Article 5 of
its founding treaty is invoked --- that is, when an ally is directly
attacked. Common external threats generate unified responses. After
9/11, for example, NATO members quickly joined the U.S. campaign against
Taliban --- ruled Afghanistan. However, [when]{.underline} the [alliance
faces a [security issue]{.mark}]{.underline} that does
[[not]{.underline}]{.mark} invoke [**[A]{.mark}**rticle
**[5]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [alliance [cohesion is less]{.mark}
certain]{.underline} because [[members have **different priorities**
that guide]{.underline}]{.mark} their **[cost-benefit
[calculations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In such cases, liberal commitment
to the rule of law has played an important role. The alliance has proved
cohesive when acting outside Europe and when the stakes are well
grounded in international law, as was the case during its 2011
intervention in Libya, which was backed by a un Security Council
resolution. In other instances, when the alliance has faced more diffuse
and contested security challenges, a common commitment to liberal
democratic values has proved even more essential to maintaining
cohesion. Consider the Balkans: in 1995, NATO conducted Operation
DelibeForce to protect un safe areas in Bosnia that had come under
attack from ethnic Serbian armed groups. And in 1999, it conducted
another air operation against the armed forces of what remained of
Yugoslavia to prevent military attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. In
both campaigns, Article 5 did not apply because no NATO member had been
directly attacked. Nor was the alliance acting under a un Security
Council resolution. These interventions tested the alliance\'s political
capacity, but ultimately, members coalesced around their common
commitment to human rights, a principle that would be- come enshrined in
international law in 2005 as \"the responsibility to protect\" (or R2P).
The alliance\'s ability to prevent mass atrocities in non-NATO states
was thus as much a product of its members\' values as it was a product
of their military assets By contrast, [when democratic values and
institutions]{.underline} have [cut in the **opposite
direction**]{.underline}, the [[alliance]{.underline}]{.mark} has been
[[divided]{.underline}]{.mark}. Compare NATO\'s interventions in the
Balkan wars to its [disunity [over]{.mark}]{.underline} the 2003 U.S.
invasion of [[Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although the Bush
administration contended that Iraq threatened global security by
pursuing weapons of mass destruction (an area of international law far
better established than R2P), [NATO]{.underline} was [far from
unified]{.underline} on the matter. In fact, [[France and
Germany]{.underline}]{.mark} [were among the **most [vocal
critics]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the invasion. Although NATO\'s
interventions in the Balkans had been legally problematic, the allies
were still united in pursuing them because of their shared commitment to
human rights. But when it came to Iraq, without a justification rooted
in liberalism, [[not]{.mark} all]{.underline} of them [were [willing to
support]{.mark}]{.underline} an [[intervention beyond]{.mark} the
purview of **[A]{.mark}**rticle **[5]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[NATO members]{.underline} in Europe [have begun deploying ships
and]{.underline} fighter pla[nes to Eastern Europe]{.underline}, a move
NATO officials say is aimed at "reinforcing Allied deterrence and
defense as Russia continues its military buildup in and around Ukraine."
[But are NATO allies in agreement on the Russia-Ukraine
crisis]{.underline}? Last week, President [Biden appeared to signal
disagreement between the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
its European allies on a potential response to Russian aggression
against Ukraine]{.underline}. Top U.S. officials have since worked to
clean up the president's remarks and vowed a "united" response. Our
research, however, found that [scholars and policy analysts in NATO
countries have **radically different understandings** of developments in
Ukraine after Russia's 2014 intervention in Crimea and the
Donbas]{.underline}. Some of these [differences reflect cultural
conventions and perceived national interests. Other]{.underline} key
[factors include]{.underline} how different authors view [the concept of
"justice]{.underline}" --- whether its source is international law, or
history and identity. [These differences]{.underline}, in turn, [create
**very different perspectives** over what might be the optimal
combination of deterrence and appeasement]{.underline} in Western
responses to Russian actions. Not one narrative, but many We studied how
Western scholars and policy analysts made sense of the conflict in and
around Ukraine by closely examining their publications over a six-year
period after the invasion of Crimea. How did they attribute
responsibility for the ongoing conflict --- and how did they propose to
resolve it? [After reviewing]{.underline} a total of 1,009 [publications
from the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [Britain, Germany,
France, Italy, Greece and Poland, we identified six different narratives
about the nature of this conflict and]{.underline} possible
[solutions]{.underline}. Will deterrence counter Russian aggression?
[The first narrative]{.underline} --- dominant [in Poland]{.underline},
prevalent among U.S. and British authors, and popular with some analysts
in France and Germany --- [calls out unprovoked Russian aggression and
advocates for deterrent measures]{.underline}. This view holds Moscow
responsible for the violation of international law and Ukraine's
sovereignty. [Appropriate responses]{.underline}, for those with this
view, [include intensifying Western efforts to counter the aggression,
tougher sanctions]{.underline} on Russia, [more aid]{.underline} to
Ukraine, [and greater support for its democracy]{.underline} and
European integration. Or would appeasement be a better option? [The
second narrative]{.underline} --- popular [in France and
Germany]{.underline} and prominent among U.S. realists who view Ukraine
as marginal to American interests --- [tries to reconcile Russia's
aggression with a preference for dialogue]{.underline} with an essential
global power. While the first narrative defends the rules-based order,
[the second shifts the focus to interests]{.underline}. The proposed
[dialogue can include]{.underline} different [compromises with Moscow at
Ukraine's expense]{.underline} such as ditching Kyiv's NATO membership
agenda [and reducing Ukraine's control of parts of its
territory]{.underline} to purely nominal. [A third
narrativ]{.underline}e --- one popular among academics and policy
analysts [in France and Italy, as well as Greece]{.underline} ---
[presents Russia's actions as a legitimate response to a perceived
threat]{.underline} [from Western encroachment]{.underline} into its
traditional sphere of influence --- [and]{.underline}/or to
[irresponsible policies]{.underline} pursued [by Ukraine]{.underline}'s
post-Euromaidan government. [In this view, the West and
Ukraine]{.underline} --- not Russia --- [are primarily responsible for
the conflict, and this justifies]{.underline} significant [concessions
to Moscow]{.underline} that boil down to the recognition of Ukraine's
"limited sovereignty." [The fourth narrative]{.underline} --- prevalent
[in Greece and]{.underline}, to a lesser extent, [Italy]{.underline} ---
[blames the Ukrainian government for]{.underline} developments in
[Crimea and the Donbas, citing irreconcilable identity differences
between Kyiv and]{.underline}/or [western Ukraine]{.underline}, on the
one hand, [and the eastern and southern regions]{.underline}, on the
other. [This view portrays the West as complicit in Ukraine's
wrongdoings, but plays down Russia's participation]{.underline}. To
these analysts, [the West can normalize relations with Moscow by
pressuring Ukraine to change]{.underline} official
[policies]{.underline} --- for instance, on regional autonomy for the
Donbas and an official status for the Russian language. [A fifth
narrative]{.underline} --- also popular primarily [in Italy and
Greece]{.underline} --- [holds Russia and the West jointly
responsible]{.underline} for the situation in Ukraine and Eastern
Europe. To these scholars and analysts, [Ukraine's own preferences are
of little importance]{.underline}, as the country is merely the
battlefield between Russia and the West. [Ending the conflict requires
renegotiating the world order,]{.underline} including regional security
arrangements. [A sixth]{.underline} and final [narrative]{.underline}
among some analysts [in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and Europe takes a neutral stance, and proposes no overarching
solutions. It focuses]{.underline} instead [on narrower policy
questions]{.underline} like sanitation or child trafficking that have
arisen during the conflict, [and how dialogue]{.underline} of all
parties [is essential to end to the suffering]{.underline} of the
affected populations. [Different experiences lead to different
conclusions Where a country sits historically and geographically says a
lot about where its foreign policy]{.underline} establishment and where
policy analysts and academics [stand on the Russian-Ukrainian
conflict]{.underline}. For instance, [the]{.underline} strong [tendency
in Poland to blame Russian aggression]{.underline} and urge deterrence
[reflects]{.underline} both [the country's historical experience with
Russia, and its position as a front-line state. This view is also widely
held in Britain, in line with its government's strong deterrence
stance]{.underline} against Putin's Russia. By contrast, [French policy
analysts and academics are more likely to see cooperation with Russia as
an opportunity to weaken U.S. influence and increase France's political
weight]{.underline} in Europe. While recognizing Russian aggression,
they thus prefer the West to continue dialogue with Russia and
compromise at Ukraine's expense. [Russia's long cultural presence in
France]{.underline} also [helps shape another prominent
view]{.underline} among French analysts and academics: [that Russian
actions are a legitimate response to a perceived Western threat. In
Italy, a lack of preoccupation with Ukraine]{.underline} in the academic
and think tank community [mirrors a lack of interest in
Ukraine]{.underline} on the part of political elites. The two
predominant narratives include justifying the Russian aggression by
pointing out the historical ties between the Russian and Ukrainian
peoples, and viewing Ukraine as an object of geopolitical rivalry
between the West and Russia. What [these findings suggest]{.underline}
is [that Western scholars and analysts]{.underline}, just like Western
policymakers, [remain divided on how to respond to Moscow's aggressive
behavior]{.underline}. Should the West try to deter Russia, risking some
imminent instability but maintaining the established order in the long
run; or try to appease Russia and deal with any repercussions as they
arise? [With the new escalation of conflict, **these differences within
NATO allies have become particularly acute and are unlikely to be
resolved easily** --- a fact Russia may be counting on.]{.underline}

[When]{.underline} world [leaders gathered in London]{.underline} last
week [to celebrate [NATO]{.mark}'s 70th anniversary, they put an
international spotlight on a partnership that is profoundly
ailing.]{.underline} Seventy years after the signing of the North
Atlantic Treaty and the formation of the Atlantic Alliance, [the
West's]{.underline} most powerful and enduring [military bloc is
[suffering]{.mark} from **deep [systemic
dysfunctions]{.mark}.**]{.underline} That all is not well in the
Alliance was clear from the wrangling between President Trump and French
President Emmanuel Macron, who traded recriminations ahead of the summit
and pointed barbs at press-conference time. But [the problems run far
deeper than simple personal politics]{.underline}, and stem from at
least two sources. Today, perhaps [NATO's most pressing challenge is the
[lack]{.mark} of [a clearly-defined mission]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
alliance was formed following World War II in order, as its first
Secretary-General, Lord Ismay, put it, to "keep the Soviet Union out,
the Americans in, and the Germans down." In the decades that followed,
that formula helped transform Germany into a crucial ally and
successfully deter Soviet aggression. But it more or less fell by the
wayside with the collapse of the USSR, replaced by the broad objective
of establishing --- and then broadening --- a zone of peace and
stability across the European Continent, and eventually beyond. Today,
[NATO is once again focused on Russia]{.underline}, which in recent
years has demonstrated that it is eager to subvert the post-World War II
democratic order in Europe. Since Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine and
subsequent annexation of Crimea, the alliance has significantly stepped
up its military deployments around --- and assistance to --- Eastern
Europe and the Baltic States as a means of deterring further military
adventurism by Moscow. [Yet]{.underline}, politically, [the]{.underline}
modern-day [[alliance isn't]{.underline}]{.mark} necessarily [[united
regarding the importance of that mission, or]{.mark} even [what might be
needed to accomplish it]{.mark}.]{.underline} Back in 2017, a simulated
[wargame]{.underline} carried out [by the]{.underline} prestigious
[[RAND]{.mark} Corporation]{.underline} think tank [[found NATO woefully
unprepared to]{.mark} effectively [counter a Russian]{.mark} land
[offensive against the Baltics]{.mark} --- and warned that its defenses
would collapse within 36 to 60 hours of a Russian invasion.]{.underline}
Some two-and-a-half years on, [little has changed.]{.underline} Earlier
this fall, [outgoing Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford told
Newsweek that "the NATO advantage over a resurgent Russia has eroded,"
and that the alliance was losing its edge in strategic competition with
an increasingly technologically advanced, militarily capable and
politically aggressive Kremlin. NATO leaders, meanwhile, don't
appear]{.underline} uniformly [committed to fixing the
problem.]{.underline} Just weeks before the London gathering, President
Macron made global headlines when he argued forcefully in an interview
with The Economist that Europe needed to rethink its approach to Russia
--- despite the fact that the Kremlin hasn't done much to warrant the
lifting of sanctions that had been leveled by the EU back in 2014 in
response to its invasion of Ukraine. At the same time, President Trump's
calls for greater military contributions from member states as a way of
shoring up the alliance's strategic capabilities have been met with much
political resistance and, at least so far, too little substantive
movement. As of mid-2019, according to official NATO estimates, [the
[median defense expenditures]{.mark} among the alliance's 28 member
states [was]{.mark} a paltry [1.63 percent of]{.mark} national
[GDP]{.mark}]{.underline}, and just eight countries --- the U.S.,
Greece, Estonia, the U.K., Romania, Poland, Latvia and Lithuania ---
were spending more than the recommended 2 percent of GDP annually on
defense. The difficulties don't end there, however. [NATO]{.underline}
also [suffers from **serious internal friction**.]{.underline}
[[Alliances]{.underline}]{.mark}, they say, [~~limp~~ \[[move]{.mark}\]
along [at the pace of their most grudging member]{.mark}, and today
NATO's most recalcitrant participant is unquestionably
**[Turkey]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Over the past decade and a half, [the
country]{.underline} that once served as the bloc's southeastern flank
and its geopolitical outpost in the Middle East [has become a
less-than-reliable strategic ally.]{.underline} Under President Recep
Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development Party, [Turkey has
trended in a distinctly anti-Western direction. Although officials in
Ankara still pay lip service to their country's longstanding goal of
joining Europe, the actions taken by Erdogan's government]{.underline}
in recent years --- [from the [acquisition of]{.mark} advanced [Russian
air defenses against NATO's urging]{.mark} to its [permissive]{.mark}
attitude [toward]{.mark} regional [extremists]{.mark} --- have given
decidedly different indications.]{.underline} Indeed, just a week before
the NATO summit in London, [Turkey effectively [held the alliance
hostage]{.mark} when it refused to endorse a plan to bolster defense of
the Baltics unless it got more backing from Europe for its recent
invasion and occupation of Syria.]{.underline} It subsequently moderated
its stance as a result of international pressure. In the process,
though, [it injected still more doubt into the notion that it remains a
committed member of the NATO coalition.]{.underline} [All of this
matters a great deal for the future of the alliance.]{.underline} NATO's
London summit closed with a communique that painted a decidedly rosy
picture of the organization's health, and spent precious little time
discussing the real systemic problems now facing the world's most
important military bloc. That's a real shame, because [[until NATO can
clearly]{.mark}, unequivocally begin to [address]{.mark} its own
[shortcomings, the]{.mark} state of its [union cannot]{.mark} truly [be
strong]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### 2nc US Commitment 

#### Trump's rhetoric shook the alliance -- questions regarding US commitment divide members

**Robinson '6-7** --- Eric; M.P.P. in public policy, College of William
& Mary; B.A. in economics, government, College of William & Mary, senior
research programmer and analyst at RAND Corporation. June 7, 2022;

With an active Russian invasion on its doorstep and Finland and Sweden
asking to join, [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} seems more relevant than at
any point since the fall of the Berlin Wall. But, former
counterterrorism official Eric Robinson warns the following op-ed,
[alliance leaders need to keep a wary eye on]{.underline} the
**[[looming danger]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [[is
**America**]{.mark}**n politics**]{.underline}. It is a moment of
triumph for NATO. The alliance's main threat, the Russian military,
suffered decisive defeats in the battles for Kyiv and Kharkiv in
Ukraine. Furthermore, as a direct result of Russia's invasion, both
Sweden and Finland have petitioned NATO for membership. Not since the
Berlin Wall fell has a component of the United States' commitment to
Europe's security been so clearly validated. Regrettably, this
remarkable state of affairs in Europe [[obscures]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [alliance's **true [fragility]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- a
[[vulnerability so pronounced]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[NATO]{.mark}'s]{.underline} current confidence [could]{.underline}
soon [[become a]{.mark} **historic [footnote]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Internal disputes are not new to NATO, of course. Charles [[de
Gaulle]{.underline}]{.mark} withdrew French military forces from NATO's
high command, [Greece and Turkey]{.underline} are effectively rivals,
[and]{.underline} there is a [substantial disparity in defense
spending]{.underline} among members. These [challenges **[pale in
comparison]{.mark}**]{.underline}, however, [to NATO's **most critical
vulnerability**]{.underline}: [American politics]{.underline}. In 1947,
Sen. Arthur Vandenberg established a baseline for American political
alignment when he stated that "politics stops at the water's edge," that
partisan differences should be minimized in matters of national
security. Republicans and Democrats alike would certainly vary in their
approaches, but challenging the Soviet Union provided a degree of
predictability to American foreign policy. This partisan harmony
continued beyond the Cold War, extending into bipartisan support for the
Persian Gulf War and the invasion of Iraq. Then came Donald
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}, and an [[**open hostility** to]{.mark}
America's longstanding international practices]{.underline}. As a
candidate, Trump articulated a [**deep skepticism** of America's
international obligations]{.underline} and his arguments resonated with
voters who had soured on the foreign policy establishment. His version
of "**[America First]{.underline}**" echoed the original America First
Committee of the 1930s and 1940s: [disdainful of [international
commitments]{.mark}]{.underline}, [comfortable with authoritarian
systems]{.underline}, [and accepting moral compromises as a **cost of
doing business**]{.underline} in a rough world. During his time in
office, Trump did not shift his views on limiting America's
international obligations, but he never truly acted on his intuition,
either. [NATO]{.underline} remained [shaken]{.underline} yet intact, his
administration amended NAFTA with Canada and Mexico, and his team helped
establish official relationships between Israel and a series of
once-hostile countries. However, since [Trump's]{.underline} exit from
office, reporting indicates that he [expressed interest]{.underline} or
actively explored going further, [including]{.underline} wanting to
[**[withdraw]{.mark} military forces** [from]{.mark} Europe]{.underline}
and [end the US military commitment to]{.underline} the Republic of
[Korea]{.underline}, [two [pillars of]{.mark} America's [global security
commitment]{.mark}]{.underline}. And notably, Trump's former national
security advisor John [Bolton]{.underline} has specifically said he
believed Trump would [seek to **leave NATO**]{.underline}. The
[[popularity of]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[America
First]{.underline}]{.mark}" politics [returns us to [NATO's **critical
vulnerability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. If he decides to run again,
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} seems almost [assured to be]{.underline}
the [GOP's nominee]{.underline} for president [in
[2024]{.mark}]{.underline}. Recent primaries and patterns of behavior
among Republicans currently in the House and Senate have shown that
Trump's hold on the GOP may not be ironclad, but he remains the leading
party figure. Should Trump return to the White House, [he
would]{.underline} likely [do so with]{.underline} a [Republican House
and Senate **far less likely** to push back on his foreign
policy]{.underline} than during his first term in office --- and as a
[president]{.underline} who will [assuredly]{.underline} be inclined to
[listen to his]{.underline} close supporters encouraging his **[basest
instincts]{.underline}**.

#### Even fear of declining US engagement wrecks cooperation

**Kunz 2021**

Barbra, senior researcher at the Institute for Peace Research and
Security Policy at the University of Hamburg. She specializes in
European security and the debates surrounding it, with a special
emphasis on France and Germany. "'There is No "Europe': Disagreements
Within NATO Are Not Solely Transatlantic and Pertain to the Fundamentals
of European Security", NATO 2030: Towards a New Strategic Concept and
Beyond, (157-176), 2021.dmr

As discussed above, at least part of the suspicions against France's
strategic dialogue with Russia, and more broadly European strategic
autonomy, arise from fears that Paris may have ambitions to 'decouple'
European security from that of the United States. In reality, as noted
above, 'decoupling' is not on European capitals' agenda, and thus also
not on Paris'. Yet, [another aspect over which Europeans disagree is
their analyses of long-term prospects for US security guarantees. The
debate is consequently about whether Europe needs to start thinking
about a 'Plan B' or whether]{.underline} Joe [Biden's election as US
president means that risks of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates withdrawing from or [reducing its engagement for
Europe are off the table. In this context, threat
perception]{.underline} again [matters tremendously. The greater the
fear of Russia, the greater the fear of decoupling. Depending on the
kinds of threats European capitals consider most pressing, their focus
is either on expeditionary operations]{.underline} (terrorism)
[or]{.underline} collective [territorial defense]{.underline} (Russia).
[This leads not only to considerable differences in defense planning and
posture]{.underline} as discussed above, [but also to different degrees
of dependence on the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.
Unsurprisingly, therefore, [how vociferously European countries place
themselves in the Atlanticist camp correlates]{.underline} strongly
[with the intensity with which they perceive a Russian
threat]{.underline}. This is not to say that France, which even in this
context represents the other end of the European spectrum, does not need
the United States. The two countries in fact cooperate closely at the
bilateral level. For Paris, US-French cooperation is most valuable and
crucial in the Sahel region in the fight against terrorism, where the
United States notably provides crucial reconnaissance and surveillance
to France's counter-terrorism operation Barkhane.36 From a French
perspective, this is the most important vector of transatlantic defense
cooperation, as again became apparent after the 2020 US elections, when
French minister of the Armed Forces Florence Parly expressed her hopes
of continued US engagement in that region.37 Yet, as seen from Paris,
the nation's survival is hardly dependent on the United States, as
opposed to perceptions in Central and Eastern European countries where
the US is ultimately considered the guarantor of the nations' existence.
Those states that perceive a threat from Russia are at the same time the
most convinced Atlanticists who, in view of their situation, rely on the
closest possible cooperation with the United States---and are
correspondingly skeptical about stronger cooperation in the EU. On the
one hand, they are afraid of prompting less US engagement. On the other
hand, they want to avoid having to invest scarce resources in the CSDP,
which is by definition not about territorial defense. [One key question
for the continent's security is: how likely is continued US
engagement?]{.underline} Given that US engagement will still be decided
in Washington rather than in Paris, Berlin, or Warsaw, [how likely is it
that US administrations want to maintain US security guarantees for
Europe? And how likely is it---provided they have the political
will---that they will be able to do so in light of political and
budgetary constraints? On this issue, views and assessments]{.underline}
again [vary across Europe]{.underline}. Once more, France may be
considered the outlier. It is fair to argue that the French analysis on
future US engagement is the most pessimistic for European security,
based on two observations. First, [it is often stressed in France that
'Trumpism' is not gone with Donald Trump and that US domestic politics
will likely remain volatile]{.underline}.38 Second, as most recently
reiterated in its 2021 Strategic Update, France expects the United
States to refocus its security policies toward Asia and away from
Europe, notably in light of China's emergence as a strategic rival.39
The French take is thus both relatively traditional---after all, de
Gaulle decided to acquire nuclear weapons because he deemed US security
guarantees unreliable---and based on systemic factors. In most other
countries, transatlantic security relations tend to be viewed in a much
more 'personalized' manner, i.e., with much greater emphasis on the
occupant of the White House without explicitly accounting for systemic
factors. From such a vantage point, the years of the Trump
administration are considered an anomaly. With Joe Biden's election, and
for instance his speech at the 2021 virtual edition of the Munich
Security Conference in which he declared that "America is back,"40
transatlantic security relations are seen as returning to normal. Joe
Biden's accession to the US presidency has therefore already changed one
key aspect of Europe's defense debate: the question of whether or not
Europe---and the EU in particular---should aspire for more strategic
autonomy. With the Biden administration, the French argument that Europe
needs to step up its joint defense efforts to compensate for diminished
US engagement clearly seems weakened in the eyes of many.

### 2nc Burden Sharing

#### NATO [will not survive]{.underline} unless European states and Canada pay their [fair share]{.underline} -- [history]{.underline} indicates that [they won't]{.underline} 

**Richter '16** -- Associate professor of political science at the
University of Windsor, in Windsor, Ontario, Canada (Andrew, Comparative
Strategy, 35:4, 298-314, "Sharing the burden? U.S. allies, defense
spending, and the future of NATO", November 2, 2016,
<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01495933.2016.1222843>
)//RG

And yet, [regardless of the precise amount the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [will spend on defense in]{.underline} 2017 (and
the [years to follow), it is a certainty that it will remain the world's
largest spender]{.underline} for the foreseeable future, [while the goal
of more equitable burden sharing in the]{.underline} Western [alliance
will remain elusive.]{.underline} Sixty-five years of history has
revealed that most [European countries (and Canada) are]{.underline}
simply [not prepared to spend what is required to]{.underline} field and
[maintain]{.underline} highly advanced [defense forces, and it does
not]{.underline} particularly [matter what the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [wants]{.underline}. In effect, [European
governments have never believed]{.underline} that [Washington will
diminish its commitment]{.underline} to the Western alliance, no matter
how little they contribute nor how shameless they are on free riding on
the United States.112 As Ted Galen Carpenter noted in a 2014 article, it
appears that [the only way to fundamentally change this dynamic is if
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates were to [make
clear]{.underline} by its actions---not its words---that [it will no
longer tolerate]{.underline} alliance defense [free riding.]{.underline}
[That would]{.underline} likely [mean withdrawing most]{.underline} (if
not all) [American military personnel from Europe and dramatically
reducing]{.underline} air and naval [assets on the
continent]{.underline}.113 [It would also mean ending Washington's
domination of collective defense efforts in NATO]{.underline}. Further,
the United States would begin campaigning in favor of the establishment
of a pan-European defense force.114 In effect, [Washington would have to
put allied countries on notice that it is no longer prepared to bear
the]{.underline} overwhelming [burden of Western defense, and there are
limits to its willingness to pay for the defense of others]{.underline}
(it might be noted that in March 2016 Republican front-runner Donald
Trump made precisely this point.)115 Needless to say, [the chances of
this happening seem slim;]{.underline} for starters, the United States
seems pre- pared, even given recent developments, to continue paying a
significant cost both for its own and its allies' security (in this
regard, the administration announced in 2016 that it plans to quadruple
U.S. military spending in Europe)116 and the constituency favoring
defense spending---and the military more generally---is far larger than
in Europe or Canada.117 [Yet if the alliance is to survive, significant
changes must be made. The]{.underline} key [question is whether European
states and Canada will make the necessary funding decisions that will
permit them to field]{.underline} modern and [capable forces in the
future.]{.underline} Unfortunately, [there are plenty of reasons for
skepticism, as defense downsizing]{.underline} in Europe and Canada
[casts doubt over most allies' ability and willingness to
invest]{.underline} in modern capabilities. Indeed, [NATO]{.underline}
itself [seems to have little influence on member states' security
calculations,]{.underline} and a recent proposal to "name and shame"
countries that are not meeting the spending target suggests that the
alliance has concluded that public embarrassment holds the best chance
of encouraging states to spend more, an unmistakable sign of
desperation.118 Indeed, [rather than increase their defense programs,
most European states and Canada are engaged in,]{.underline} as Hallems
and Schreer have recently noted, [a strategy of "strategic restraint,"
which sees a reduced willingness to pay for]{.underline} the major
[defense investments]{.underline} necessary [to protect
against]{.underline} possible [threats]{.underline}.119 In the author's
opinion, both [Canada and Germany]{.underline} have grown so accustomed
to low defense spending that they [may be incapable of dramatic change
at this point]{.underline} (although at least Berlin seems to have
recently recognized the seriousness of the problem[). As
evidence]{.underline}, one just needs to note [the array of dated
military platforms]{.underline} that [both countries
operate]{.underline}, apparently [oblivious to the risks such equipment
poses]{.underline} both to their own crews and to the civilians in the
areas they operate in. Perhaps even more importantly, however, is what
the [continued operation of such equipment]{.underline} effectively
[tells the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates---i.e., [that both
states intend to rely on Washington for their security regardless of
whether the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is pre- pared to
accept this burden or not]{.underline}. **[This would appear to be a
fundamental abdication of responsibility]{.underline}** by both
countries, but in the absence of popular opposition to the policies that
result in such military weakness, **[it seems unlikely that either state
will be changing its domestic spending priorities anytime
soon.]{.underline}** In sum, **[the growing divide in defense
expenditures and capabilities between the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[and]{.underline}** most [**other members of
NATO has resulted in the very real possibility that the alliance may not
survive.** To avoid that]{.underline} outcome, [European states and
Canada need to accept]{.underline} the fact [that a more]{.underline}
mature and [equitable defense relationship is essential]{.underline};
although in fairness it should be noted that this observation does not
apply to the UK, which continues to take its defense seriously (as does
France). [Any move toward a reasonable program]{.underline} of burden
sharing [will require a change in mind-set]{.underline} on the part of
all NATO members, as dependence on the United States is deeply embedded.
[The onus,]{.underline} though, [must be on European states and Canada
to demonstrate that they are serious about accepting]{.underline} a
greater degree of [responsibility]{.underline} for their defense. If
[**after 67 years of American protection most NATO states are still not

### 2nc Article V 

#### Article 5 is meaningless -- responses are uncertain, unplanned, and likely to be weak

While political momentum may make these membership bids inevitable, the
ultimate effects of bringing Finland and Sweden into the alliance depend
on making sober decisions before they enter. Specifically, [NATO allies
must have a plan for defending]{.underline} the two
[countries]{.underline}. The two Nordic countries' [**[defense cannot
rest alone on the perceived sanctity of]{.mark} NATO's [Article
5]{.mark}** defense commitment [or]{.mark} on a vague [plan to address
the issue later]{.mark}.]{.underline} WHAT'S THE PLAN? [To be effective,
[alliances need to have hard discussions about war plans]{.mark}. Who
will the allies defend and how will they do so? Do]{.underline} the
prospective new [members agree]{.underline} with existing NATO allies
[on who constitutes a threat and where? Do]{.underline} the two [groups
have similar visions for how to address the threat Russia
poses]{.underline} if the situation becomes acute? [Are their military
doctrines compatible?]{.underline} These are pivotal questions for all
alliances. When states form an alliance, the final treaty is commonly
short on war-planning specifics. But discussions over aspects of war
plans often consume a fair amount of time and energy during such
negotiations. Indeed, [[disagreements]{.mark} over these issues can
ultimately [undermine an alliance's formation]{.mark}]{.underline}. If a
state does not see the potential alliance as adequate for meeting its
security aims, it can look elsewhere. This most infamously occurred in
August 1939. The Soviet Union, frustrated over an inability to agree
with the United Kingdom on how best to counter a potential German
attack, left the Anglo-French-Soviet defense treaty negotiations. It
then signed a nonaggression pact with Nazi Germany. Hard bargaining over
the defense practicalities of a potential alliance treaty was also part
of the creation of NATO itself.1 Far from a given when the alliance
treaty was negotiated in 1948 and 1949, there were endless arguments
about how to define the North Atlantic region in the first place. This
definition turned out to be critical at the strategic level of war
planning: [before one can talk about logistics and tactics, one must
decide who should actually be protected.]{.underline} The talks nearly
broke down over debates about whether to include Norway (France was
opposed), Italy (U.S. and British officials were skeptical), or Algeria
(then a French department). Wanting to ensure that a deal was reached,
the parties made compromises: Norway and Italy were included, and
Algeria was indeed covered (until it gained independence, at which point
the North Atlantic Treaty was amended). While details over executing the
actual defensive procedures were delegated to a soon-to-be-created body
(the "O" of NATO), the perception was that there was time to figure it
out. Communism was a threat, but there was no perception of an immediate
Soviet invasion. [While a failure to settle logistical and operational
details might have been understandable when NATO was formed, the truth
is that planning for the defense of]{.underline} prospective new
[[members continued to be neglected]{.mark}, including in recent
decades.]{.underline} Consider the closest parallel to Finland's
accession, that of the Baltic states. [Even]{.underline} in the 1990s,
[before [Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania]{.mark} became official
candidates for NATO membership, the states were [seen
as]{.mark}]{.underline} largely [[indefensible]{.mark}, in purely
military terms]{.underline}, from an operational and tactical
standpoint. [[No solutions to this]{.mark} challenge [were
pursued]{.mark}]{.underline} until well after their entry into the
alliance. [NATO members chose to overlook the lack of a solution when
they admitted the Baltic states]{.underline} in 2004, on the grounds
that the alliance ought to support fledgling democracies that had
demonstrated their value through peacekeeping operations. More
importantly, at that time Russia did not pose an imminent threat. This
defensive shortcoming was eventually corrected, so to speak, in the wake
of Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine by the creation of NATO's Enhanced
Forward Presence. Like the 2014 Wales Summit pledge that NATO members
made to increase their military spending, the Enhanced Forward Presence
was motivated by Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. The threat of armed
aggression, long a concern of the Baltic states, had now been realized.
For the Baltic states and other members of NATO's eastern flank, there
was a window of opportunity to adjust. No such window is obvious in the
case of Finland. WHERE ARE THE TROOPS? Planning is about more than just
paper reports and memoranda to be filed away and dusted off when the
time arrives. It is about ensuring that the proper resources are being
developed and deployed to execute a plan. One such issue that NATO
members must decide as soon as possible is whether to position forces in
Finland and Sweden and, if so, how many. Even if alliance members opt
not to pre-position forces in the two Nordic countries, they will have
to determine where the forces that would be used for their defense will
come from. Russia's military is being weakened by the war in Ukraine and
has displayed shortcomings that few analysts predicted. It will take
time for Russian forces to recover, but eventually they will probably
still be capable of "fait accompli" operations against some section of
Finnish or even Swedish territory. This would involve quickly moving
forces into an unprotected or lightly protected portion of territory,
thereby compelling the other side to take offensive action in order to
reverse the territorial acquisition. Concerns over such an operation
against Finland are heightened by its 800-plus-mile border with Russia.
While Finland has approximately 3,000 personnel in its border guard,
these forces are oriented primarily toward enforcing immigration control
rather than stopping an invading force. When coupled with Russia's
threats, this force positioning creates a precarious state of existing
defenses along that border. As the creation of the Enhanced Forward
Presence implies, [**NATO's [Article 5 does not automatically deter
aggression]{.mark}.** This is because]{.underline}, to use the language
popular among international relations scholars, [[it]{.mark} ultimately
[does not "tie hands]{.mark}."]{.underline} It is true that Article 5
obligates alliance members to treat an attack in North America or Europe
on one or more members as "an attack against them all," but the text
goes on to say that each member will then assist "by taking forthwith .
. . such action as it deems necessary." Practically, this means that for
each NATO member and the alliance as a whole, [Article 5 is more
appropriately viewed as]{.underline} specifying something akin to
[saying an attack on one merits a response to be determined by the
individual members.]{.underline} Concretely, once the North Atlantic
Council determines that an attack meriting an Article 5 response has
occurred, the members decide on the appropriate response and then
individual members decide how they will contribute to that response.
[Since NATO decisionmaking is predicated on consensus, [meeting
the]{.mark} first two [thresholds for]{.mark} an [Article 5 action is
never guaranteed]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Of course, [failure]{.mark} on
the part of the NATO allies to assist a member under attack could [carry
reputational consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}; if Russia were to
witness a nonresponse to a quick incursion into, say, the Baltic states,
then Moscow might be emboldened to take further measures. [But the
likelier problem is that [NATO may respond meekly]{.mark}. The space
between a nonresponse and full-fledged direct military engagement by all
NATO members against the aggressor is wide enough to allow for a host of
options that meet the letter of Article 5's terms without changing the
military facts on the ground.]{.underline} This is why, as illustrated
by the Enhanced Forward Presence, deterrence requires "sinking costs,"
meaning [forward deploying troops]{.underline} on NATO territory before
an attack occurs. But for this approach to be effective, it [cannot be
done lightly.]{.underline} The forces must not be merely a tripwire,
where a few troops are deployed with the understanding that their deaths
would trigger a larger response. Such a [policy would be too slow to
stop a fait accompli operation and would run again into the problem that
Article 5 does not obligate any particular type of action.]{.underline}
Instead, forces need to be deployed in large enough numbers to have a
material impact on the aggressor's battle plan. Ideally, the
forward-deployed NATO forces would be sufficient to tip the local
balance of power in favor of the defender so as to deny territory to the
aggressor. At a minimum, they should be enough to slow down the
aggressor's strike, preventing the invading forces from securing
territory before the defender's reinforcements could arrive. This
assumes that foreign forces would even be allowed on Finland's
territory. That is not yet clear. HARD CONVERSATIONS [[Given]{.mark}
that [Finland's membership process]{.mark} is proceeding swiftly, that
NATO is actively]{.underline} and heavily [supporting [Ukraine]{.mark}'s
fight against Russia, and that NATO bureaucrats are busy crafting a [new
Strategic Concept, **there is little space**]{.mark} **right [now for
hard conversations]{.mark}** on the above points. This is unfortunate,
as the lack of conversation could start the new relationship off on
precarious footing.]{.underline}

Collective self-defense is enshrined at NATO's very core: [Article
5]{.underline} of the North Atlantic Treaty directly states that "an
armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America
shall be considered an attack against them all" and that force can be
used in response. [It's]{.underline} also [a relatively untested
commitment --- and an increasingly fraught one.]{.underline} Since
NATO's founding in 1949, [it has been invoked only once]{.underline}: On
Sept. 12, 2001, after the terrorist attacks in the United States the day
before. Seventy years after the founding of NATO, [**it's [not clear
that]{.mark} all [allies are on the same side about what
collective]{.mark} self-[defense would actually
mean]{.mark}**.]{.underline} President Trump has emerged as a powerful
critic of the alliance, while [Turkey's intervention in northeastern
Syria raised concerns about just how far collective security would
go.]{.underline} In a recent interview with the Economist, French
President Emmanuel [Macron wondered whether NATO's collective security
could result in his country fighting a war against Syria. "[**What will
Article 5 mean tomorrow?"** Macron wondered]{.mark} aloud.]{.underline}
[It's not clear whether members of the public are clear on that
either.]{.underline} Earlier this year, British [polling
firm]{.underline} YouGov [quizzed people in four major NATO powers ---
Britain, France, Germany and the United States --- about what foreign
nations they would be willing to defend, including NATO allies and some
non-NATO allies such as Sweden and Ukraine.]{.underline} [The results
suggested that **[being a NATO ally did not ensure]{.mark} public
[support]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Only minorities of the populations in
France and Germany said that they would not defend Romania, a NATO ally
since 2004 and a European Union member, or even Turkey, a NATO ally
since 1952 (Britons were also divided on support for Turkey). However,
in all countries polled, majorities said they would support Finland and
Sweden, which are not part of NATO. Majorities in Britain and the United
States also said they would come to the aid of Ukraine, a country that
was blocked from joining NATO in 2008 --- confusingly, a decision pushed
by the United States at the time. And [although Germany and the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [have a decades-long alliance,
[only a minority of Germans said they would come to the defense of
Americans]{.mark} if the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [were
attacked]{.underline} YouGov's poll was conducted in April, but shared
again Monday in anticipation of a NATO meeting in London this week
during which Trump and other world leaders will celebrate the
anniversary of the alliance's founding. The results prompted debate
among European security experts, with many wondering how to parse the
information, whether the question itself was phrased in a confusing or
misleading way, or even whether the polling data could be considered
accurate at all (comparative international polling is an expensive and
difficult business, with lots of opportunities for error and
misinterpretation). Some [other [surveys]{.mark} have [found]{.mark}
similar levels of national [disagreement about how Article 5 would work
in practice]{.mark}]{.underline}, although the takeaways are often
complicated. In 2017, the [Pew Research Center asked people in a variety
of NATO member states whether they would respond with military force [if
a NATO ally got into]{.mark} a serious [conflict with
Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Only 40 percent of Germans
favored]{.mark} using military [force]{.mark} in this situation,
compared with 45 percent of Britons, 53 percent of the French and 62
percent of Americans. Germany may be notable for its mixed feelings
about the alliance.]{.underline} A poll conducted this year by the
German company Körber-Stiftung found that [[many]{.mark} in the country
were **[skeptical about key parts of its NATO
relationship]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with only 39 percent saying that
Germany should have a closer relationship to the United States rather
than Russia. Whether these polling numbers convey a shifting view of
NATO collective security among the public may not matter --- national
security decisions are made not by referendum. Trump, who was a fierce
critic of NATO on the campaign trail and still complains regularly about
European military spending, eventually committed to Article 5 in June
2017 during a White House news conference with Romanian President Klaus
Iohannis. But only a year later, Trump suggested that Montenegro, a
small nation that joined NATO last year, could lead to a global war.
"They are very aggressive people. They may get aggressive, and
congratulations, you're in World War III. But that's the way it was set
up," Trump said during an interview with Fox News in July 2018 "Don't
forget, I just got here a little more than a year and a half ago," Trump
added. During a recent interview, NATO Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg said that Article 5 was the "cornerstone of NATO" and that
the fact that no European nation had been attacked since NATO started
was "perhaps the greatest success" of the organization. But if NATO's
collective security serves best as a tool for deterrence, it relies on
the perception that it would actually work in practice. The risk now is
that if it ever had to be used in practice, world leaders might find it
is a relic of the past that no longer functions.

THE CONFLICT OF DIFFERENT AGENDAS

The overarching aim of this report has been to assess the main issues
and key fault lines in the debate about whether and how to strengthen
the credibility of Article 5 in case of an armed attack by another
state. The [[**debate has been split**]{.mark} between those who want
reassurance [under Article 5]{.mark}, those who prefer to focus more on
out-of-area operations, and those who are more concerned about NATO\'s
relations with Russia.]{.underline} The primary driver for the
[[Allies\' different views]{.underline}]{.mark} has thus [[depended on
their agendas]{.mark} for the future orientation of the Alliance\'s role
and purpose. These different agendas and the debate that they have
generated are the [symptoms of]{.mark} the **[strategic
diversification]{.mark}** that began after the end of the cold war and
the demise of the Soviet Union and [has become accentuated]{.mark}
within the Alliance over the last decade. [As NATO has taken on
additional members]{.mark}, as well as more challenging missions, it has
been exposed to greater **[differences]{.mark} among its members in
terms [of threat perceptions]{.mark}**, strategic priorities and foreign
policy approaches. As a result of this diversification, the Alliance
has]{.underline} to a certain degree [**[lacked cohesion in its view
of]{.mark} the [credibility of Article 5]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

\[TITLE\]: "The [crisis in [Afghanistan]{.mark} is **[shak]{.mark}ing
[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Its [[foundation]{.underline}]{.mark} was
[**already [weak]{.mark}ening** in Europe]{.underline}" European leaders
are correct to wonder what the [**frightening incompetence** on display
in Afghanistan]{.underline} means for the NATO alliance. But they should
also be nervous that the [[public opinion]{.mark} in their own
countries]{.underline} is [[mak]{.mark}ing [the]{.mark} [alliance
**unsustainable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our NATO allies are
[[democracies]{.underline}]{.mark}, and thus their leaders must always
take public opinion into account. They [[cannot]{.underline}]{.mark}
long ignore or [[run counter to]{.underline}]{.mark} their
[[voters']{.mark} **deeply held [views]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That's
why polls from 2020 and earlier this year of European public opinion
should concern both U.S. and European leaders. The polls show that
[European [public opinion]{.mark} is mixed concerning **core U.S.
interests** and [ambivalent at best]{.mark} about involving
their]{.underline} own [nations']{.underline} militaries in armed
conflict. The good news is that European opinion about NATO and the
United States remains mostly positive. A June 2021 Pew Research Center
poll found that 61 percent of Europeans had a favorable opinion of NATO,
including majorities in every country except Greece. Europeans also held
positive opinions of the United States, with more than 55 percent of
every country's populace expressing a favorable view. The problem comes
when pollsters dig a bit deeper. The [[**central feature** of]{.mark}
any military [alliance is]{.mark}]{.underline} that all [members come
to]{.underline} the [[aid]{.mark} of one another in]{.underline} case of
[attack]{.underline}. [That]{.underline} unified stance --- collective
defense in strategic parlance --- [is what makes the **alliance
credible**]{.underline}. [[If]{.mark} one]{.underline} or more [[parties
won't]{.underline}]{.mark} defend other members, [[the **whole**]{.mark}
**enterprise** [falls apart]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, that is what
many European leaders fear as the U.S. withdrawal from [Afghanistan
raises questions]{.underline} about its ability to live up to its
commitments. Whether that fear is justified or not, the fact is that
[**[majorities]{.mark}** in]{.underline} most [European
nations]{.underline} already [[oppose]{.underline}]{.mark} the [use of
their troops to [aid a NATO ally]{.mark}]{.underline}. That startling
finding comes from a February 2020 Pew Research poll. The survey asked
respondents from 16 NATO nations whether that nation should use military
force to defend a NATO ally in a serious military conflict with Russia.
Majorities of only five nations --- the United States, Britain, Canada,
the Netherlands and Lithuania --- answered yes.
[Pluralities]{.underline} or majorities in every other nation surveyed
[opposed coming to]{.underline} the [ally's assistance]{.underline},
with [opposition rising to **[60 percent]{.mark}**]{.underline} among
Germans. One might wonder why NATO is viewed favorably given this
response, but another question from the 2020 poll provides clarity. The
same people were also asked whether they thought the United States would
use military force to aid a NATO ally under attack by Russia. Majorities
or pluralities in every European nation surveyed said it would, with
percentages rising above 70 percent in Italy, Spain and Britain. Many
Europeans clearly believe that NATO is a device to ensure U.S.
protection for them rather than a collective alliance whereby all
support all. This underlying belief might be a reason only 10 of NATO's
30 members currently meet the alliance's target of spending 2 percent of
gross domestic product on defense each year. This finding alone is
troubling, but another poll points to other worrisome signs. The United
States increasingly views China as an existential threat. This is why it
is shifting military resources to the Pacific theater to combat China's
rise and working to persuade U.S. allies to resist Chinese efforts to
make those nations' economies dependent upon Chinese consumers and
companies. This means that NATO allies will increasingly be asked to
shoulder some of the burden in a de facto anti-Chinese alliance at the
same time as NATO itself deploys against Russia. Europeans do not want
to do that. A January 2021 poll from the European Council on Foreign
Relations found 60 percent of Europeans want their nation to remain
neutral in any conflict between China and the United States. The poll
also found that 59 percent of those surveyed believe that China will be
more powerful than the United States in a decade; only 19 percent
vouched for continued U.S. supremacy. Finally, [[67 percent
said]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Europe could not]{.underline}]{.mark}
always [[rely on the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates and had to
look after its own defense]{.underline}. [Each]{.underline} of these
[trends]{.underline} points to [electorates that **won't [back]{.mark}**
[the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates in]{.underline} the
[conflict]{.underline} that U.S. leaders of both parties see as most
important.

President [Biden's decision to **withdraw from
[Afghanistan]{.mark}**]{.underline} has [[triggered]{.underline}]{.mark}
a [**[globe]{.mark}-spanning [rethink]{.mark}** [of America's

Monday, when he [[stood]{.underline}]{.mark}
"[[squarely]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[behind]{.underline}]{.mark} his
[decision to [pull out]{.mark} U.S. troops]{.underline}, also renewed
one of the most hotly contested debates of the post-9/11 era: Would a
withdrawal from Afghanistan convey weakness, provoke aggression and
[[**shatter** America's ability to lead on the **international
stage**]{.underline}]{.mark}, or would it reflect a sound realignment of
the national interest, put the country on better footing to deal with
the new challenges of the 21st century, and clarify to allies and
adversaries what the United States is and is not willing to expend
resources on?

In the European Union, which held an emergency session of foreign
ministers on Afghanistan on Tuesday, officials offered rare criticism of
Washington for risking a flood of refugees to their borders and the
return of a platform for terrorism in Central Asia.

"This kind of [troop withdrawal caused **[chaos]{.mark}**]{.underline},"
Latvia's defense minister, Artis Pabriks, said in a radio interview
Tuesday, noting the demise of long-term nation-building projects and how
the decision to withdraw was essentially foisted on Europeans. "[This
era is over]{.underline}. Unfortunately, t[he
[West]{.mark}]{.underline}, and Europe in particular, are [[showing they
are **weak**]{.mark}**er [globally]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

Germany's conservative candidate to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel,
Armin Laschet, on Tuesday called the withdrawal of forces "**[[the
greatest debacle that NATO has experienced since its
foundation]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

In China, where the U.S. withdrawal is seen as creating both risks and
opportunity, Foreign Minister Wang Yi told U.S. Secretary of State
Antony Blinken in a phone call that the rapid [[departure of U.S. troops

responsibility of \[its\] technologies to third parties," and that work
on Defense Department-backed AI would "irreparably damage Google's

Second, [[NATO will need partners]{.underline}]{.mark} on its path
towards achieving a comprehensive implementation strategy on EDTs. This
[will [require connection with the private sector]{.mark}]{.underline}
early and often, clearly communicating NATO's priorities and
requirements while providing accessible opportunities for industry,
including non-traditional ones. **[[Much of the innovative work being
undertaken]{.mark} in the commercial sector is being [carried out by
companies that have never worked in]{.mark} the [defence]{.mark} realm
or [have no wish to do so.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Therefore, building
new partnerships at NATO with the private sector will enable the
Alliance to increase awareness, share data, and creatively tap into
experiences and knowledge. Moreover, NATO and the EU should initiate a
strategic dialogue to address fundamental issues of tech governance and
data sharing in order to overcome the transatlantic tech policy divide.

### 1nc Say "No" -- Transatlantic Data War

#### US-Europe privacy divergences are intractable absent congressional action -- even then diverging norms make transatlantic data war inevitable

- TADPF = Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework

) PJW

The announcement of preliminary agreement on the long-awaited TADPF
cheered business sector on both sides of the Atlantic. Microsoft
applauded the framework, saying that it would "rebuild and strengthen
the data protection bridge between the EU and the US." Global Data
Alliance, a cross-industry coalition of companies, reckoned that the new
framework would increase economic opportunities in both the US and
Europe.

[[Whether]{.mark} the [TADPF]{.mark} allows the US and EU to
[settle]{.mark} finally their [long-running dispute]{.mark} over data
transfers with TADPF [is]{.mark} yet **[unclear]{.mark}**. Finding that
national security agencies of the US can have access to personal data
transferred from Europe, CJEU invalidated]{.underline} both Safe Harbor
Privacy Principles and the EU-US Privacy Shield, [the two predecessors
of the TADPF.]{.underline}

[**[To address fully the]{.mark} CJ[EU's concerns]{.mark}, the
[Biden]{.mark} administration [needs to amend domestic
reg]{.mark}ulation[s]{.mark}** [including]{.mark} Section 702 of the
**[F]{.mark}**oreign **[I]{.mark}**ntelligence **[S]{.mark}**urveillance
**[A]{.mark}**ct (FISA 702), Executive Order 12333 and Presidential
Policy Directive 28 (PPD-28). These [**legal adjustments will not be
easy**, but **without them, any framework on data flow**]{.mark}
**between the EU and the US [will not be
sustainable]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Austrian digital privacy activist
and lawyer Max [[Schrems, who]{.mark} was behind the lawsuits that
[challenged]{.mark} the [Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield]{.mark}, said
that the lack of details of the new framework was troubling,
[warning]{.mark} that [he would not hesitate to go to court
again]{.mark} if the final agreed text of TADPF failed to be in line
with EU laws.]{.underline}

What is more, [the future of EU-US cooperation on data transfers could
be even less promising due to their differences in their approaches to
data governance and]{.underline}, in particular, in [the fundamental
norms underpinning these strategies.]{.underline} As I have discussed in
an earlier AsiaGlobal Online article, [the US adopts a laissez-faire,
minimalist approach, while the EU believes in a relatively more
interventionist model. **[The divide is]{.mark} even more
[fundamental]{.mark}**: The [EU emphasizes]{.mark} fundamental
[rights]{.mark} of human beings, while the US is more focused on the
market. **[In the US, data is]{.mark} a form of
[capital]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Data privacy is required to safeguard
the fairness of the marketplace and the consumer's right to privacy. The
Federal Trade Commission (FTC), whose mission is to protect consumers
and competition, is therefore the designated federal agency responsible
for data privacy protection. [Due to this liberal and market-based
perspective, the US has yet to issue any comprehensive data privacy laws
at the federal level.]{.underline}

[By contrast, the EU not only views personal data privacy as a
fundamental human right but it also treats data protection as a critical
part of creating a collective European identity. Thus, the protection of
personal data privacy is written into the EU Charter of Fundamental
Rights. This constitutional status means that]{.underline} the enactment
of [data protection is comprehensive, with no areas left
unregulated.]{.underline} More important, in adhering to this
human-rights norm, [**[EU]{.mark} authorities are [unlikely to
compromise]{.mark}** on their protection efforts **[under any
circumstances]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The US government's stance on the
protection of data privacy, meanwhile, is more open to debate and
negotiation, as it is based on the market-state relationship rather than
any commitment to protect fundamental human rights that are
constitutionally guaranteed.

[This divergence in philosophy is behind the]{.underline} so-called
[**[Transatlantic Data War]{.mark}** that broke after]{.underline}
national security consultant Edward [Snowden revealed details of US data
surveillance operations. The US federal government reserves the right to
have access to personal data for reasons of national security. The EU
disagrees, arguing that data privacy, as a fundamental human right,
cannot be compromised]{.underline} anyway. It was because of worries
that human rights of European citizens would not be adequately protected
in the US that led the CJEU to nullify Safe Harbor in 2015 and its
replacement, Privacy Shield, in 2020.

[Although the US and EU have reached preliminary consensus on the
replacement of the Privacy Shield, the **[norms]{.mark} underpinning
their respective approaches towards data privacy [have not
changed]{.mark}**.]{.underline} During the ongoing negotiations for the
new framework, the EU was represented by European commissioner for
justice, underscoring the primacy of human rights protection, while the
US was represented by its secretary of commerce, reflecting Washington's
underlying market-based approach. Even though the two parties have
reached a new consensus on the legal ground for transatlantic data
transfers, [the resulting framework could be as short lived as its two
predecessors.]{.underline}

national-focused approaches to the adoption of EDTs. By contrast, for
m[ost Central and Eastern countries EDTs in defense are]{.underline}
mainly [a long-term prospect.]{.underline} Previous [[challenges in
integrating cyber capabilities]{.mark} [into NATO operations, persistent
capability gaps among the allies, and slow standardization
procedures]{.mark} [are a]{.mark}]{.underline} good [[indication]{.mark}
of the magnitude of the challenge]{.underline}, which is acknowledged at
the highest levels of NATO decision-making. As Secretary-General
Stoltenberg has stated, **[[a tech]{.mark}nological [gap
between]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[allies would undermine
interoperability and weaken alliance cohesion]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In
the context of the NATO AI and big data strategies and the Defense

[improve and facilitate tech]{.mark}nological transfers [among

smaller]{.underline} allies to specialize in [niche EDTs
capabilities]{.underline}, as has been the case with cyber, for example,
and could prevent the emergence of new technological and capability gaps
between the allies. The Biden administration's focus on shared
democratic values and the digital agenda, and its willingness to
strengthen NATO and technology partnerships, constitute a window of
opportunity for the alliance. It should be fully capitalized on to
accelerate transatlantic collaborative defense innovation.

Airborne Division, he served as a media advisor or a press secretary for

Challenges Yield to Political Interoperability Hurdles"
https://www.afcea.org/content/?q=node/11597)LR

[[The greatest challenge]{.mark} [facing]{.mark} [NATO
interoperability]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [the]{.mark} desire of individual
[nations]{.mark} to [safeguard info]{.mark}rmation and
[tech]{.mark}nology [from]{.mark} their [allies]{.mark}]{.underline},
according to the general manager of the agency tasked with enabling
coalition interoperability. [[Nations with]{.mark} [extensive]{.mark}
[data collection and processing systems]{.mark} [are reluctant]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [share]{.mark} all elements of [detailed info]{.mark}rmation
[with]{.mark} even [longtime allies]{.mark}, lest sensitive intelligence
and technology aspects are revealed.]{.underline} And, many [useful
information technologies and systems developed by an individual nation
are subject to [export controls]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
[[hinders]{.mark} their [acceptance]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [implementation
by]{.mark} other [NATO]{.mark} nations.]{.underline} Ensuring coalition
[interoperability amid these conditions is complicated by the military
transformation that is empowered by the rapid evolution of information
technologies.]{.underline} The NATO Consultation, Command and Control
(C3) Agency, or NC3A, is striving to enable coalition interoperability
both through technological advances and by overcoming the
political-cultural barriers that hinder interoperable military
operations. The NC3A faces a tougher task than its national equivalents
because it must bring together [[systems]{.mark} that are
[designed]{.mark} to address national needs, which often [differ
widely]{.mark} even [among]{.mark} [member]{.mark} [nations]{.mark}. Not
only must these systems interoperate among other national systems, they
also must interoperate with NATO systems and networks.]{.underline} So,
the cultural challenge is to establish a coalition setting where all the
participants in the coalition will trust a common domain of information
that can be shared by all participants, he says. Achieving that goal
will require providing a secure information-sharing environment that is
transparent enough for all the participants to understand that their
information is protected fully. Goals include system-of-systems
architectures that can allow diverse systems to interoperate
effectively. This will require a different set of standards that remain
to be developed, Wilhelmsen offers. "[[We are not]{.mark} [there]{.mark}
yet [in]{.mark} many of the areas for [coalition
interoperability]{.mark}]{.underline}," he admits. The programmatic area
is where [the technology gap rears its head]{.underline}. [The United
States is far ahead of even its most technologically capable
allies]{.underline}, and many new and incoming NATO members are using
obsolete 1960s and 1970s technologies. Wilhelmsen notes that the agency
continues to assess the capability maturity of technologies that member
nations bring to the coalition arena.

#### NATO emerging tech regulation [fails]{.underline} and fractures the alliance.

Technology advances. The participants agreed that technology advances
are important for NATO's continued cohesion. Technology will constitute
a significant intervening factor in how NATO nations maintain their
cohesion in the future for three reasons. First, ever-evolving
communication technology can facilitate the spread of risks coming from
outside of the Alliance and exacerbate their negative effect. The
examples that resonated the most during focus group sessions are
[[info]{.mark}rmation [war]{.mark}fare [and]{.mark} **targeted
[propaganda]{.mark}** [against NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} nations.
Internet communications technology [[creates]{.mark} **infinite
[room]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}]{.underline} alternative [[media]{.mark}
that [distort reality]{.mark}]{.underline}, contribute to the
[[emergence of populist]{.mark} and **radical
[movements]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} increase]{.underline}
the danger of [[**miscommunication** among nations]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Second, NATO risks losing the innovation game to the commercial defense
industrial sector. In the future, private companies will continue to
stay ahead of NATO in designing specifications and setting standards for
platforms. This can have a major impact on readiness and
interoperability among NATO nations if their innovation efforts (e.g.,
the U.S. Third Offset Strategy) do not materialize.31

Third, some [nations]{.underline} may become [[reluctant to
share]{.mark} their **[latest]{.mark} technology
[acquisitions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially if they put private
gains above the collective endeavor. [This]{.underline} would
[[pose]{.mark} a [challenge]{.mark}]{.underline} "[for anyone to share
information]{.underline} they own [[without gaining]{.underline}]{.mark}
any [[profit]{.mark} for themselves]{.underline}." The [[political
unwillingness]{.underline}]{.mark} may [[feed
distrust]{.underline}]{.mark}, which can [res[ult in]{.mark} a
**[deepening]{.mark} interoperability [gap]{.mark}**]{.underline}
between allies on the battlefield, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
ultimately, a [[**less cohesive** Alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}.

INTRODUCTION Due to the significance of international flows of personal
information, [the stakes are high today for]{.underline} the
[Europe]{.underline}an Union (EU) [and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [when it comes to data privacy law.]{.underline}
According to one estimate, the EU-U.S. economic relationship involves
\$260 billion in annual digital services trade.\' Cross-border
information flows represent the fastest growing component of trade in
both the EU and the United States. As one technology reporter noted,
\"International data transfers are the lifeblood of the digital
economy.\" 2 Yet, differences in transatlantic regulations potentially
imperil critical international data flows. 3 In today\'s information
economy, much of the EU-U.S. data trade involves personal data. Leading
U.S. companies depend on access to and use of the personal information
of EU citizens to provide data-driven services on the continent. Cloud
providers, which offer decentralized mobile access to computing power
throughout the world, similarly access and use the personal data of EU
citizens. A threat to these data flows derives from [EU
doubts]{.underline} as to [whether the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has sufficient privacy protection. The resulting
EU-U.S. dispute has been termed the \"**[transatlantic data
war]{.mark}**.\"]{.underline} 4 [This term refers to the transatlantic
conflict around transfers of personal data. The [roots]{.mark} of this
\"war\" [are]{.mark} found [in]{.mark} the [differing legal
approaches]{.mark} to information privacy in the two jurisdictions. The
differences are institutional, substantive]{.underline}, and, at the
same time, elusive. [[Both sides recognize info]{.mark}rmation [privacy
as]{.mark} an [important]{.mark} value [yet struggle to]{.mark} identify
the meaning of core differences and the critical baseline for future
[collaborat]{.mark}ion. In the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, [there has been [skepticism about EU
privacy rights and whether they are]{.mark} merely disguised
[protectionism]{.mark}.]{.underline} 5 [In the EU, there has been a
longstanding debate about whether U.S. law provides sufficient
protections for the personal information of EU citizens]{.underline}
when U.S. companies and public authorities collect and process it.6 This
policy debate has been accompanied by the EU setting strict limits on
transfers of personal data to any non-EU country that lacks significant
privacy protections. The restrictions are set by two EU legal mandates.
The first is the European Directive on Data Protection, which permits
data transfers from the EU to a thirdparty nation only when it has
\"adequate\" privacy protections.7 The second is the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will replace the Directive on May
25, 2018.\" Under the GDPR, the adequacy requirement for data transfers
continues to be the legal touchstone.9 [The [EU has never considered
U.S. data privacy law]{.mark} to have an [adequate]{.mark} level of
protection]{.underline}.o [It has faulted U.S. information privacy law
for its patchwork nature and lack of adequate remedies]{.underline}. In
response to the EU\'s judgment that the privacy protections of U.S. law
are insufficient, the EU and the United States developed a set of
first-generation solutions for transatlantic exchanges. A turning point
for these mechanisms came in June 2013, with the start of Edward
[[Snowden]{.mark}\'s revelations]{.underline} regarding the practices of
the National Security Agency (NSA).\" For the EU, the resulting
information [[demonstrated]{.mark} that the [NSA]{.mark} had [engaged in
data surveillance of EU]{.mark} citizens without adequate respect for
their data privacy rights.]{.underline} The [NSA\'s storage and analysis
of bulk data pertaining to EU citizens was a major point of
contention.]{.underline} 12 The resulting political firestorm has either
invalidated or imperiled all firstgeneration transatlantic data transfer
mechanisms. 13 An initial second-generation solution, the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield, was finalized in June 2016.14 There are already legal
challenges to it in the EU. 1 5 Bridging the transatlantic data divide
is, therefore, a matter of the greatest significance. On the horizon is
a possible international policy solution around \"interoperable,\" or
shared legal concepts. President Barack Obama and the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) promoted this approach. For the Obama White House,
there was a need for a \"multistakeholder process\" with the
international partners of the United States to \"facilitate
interoperable privacy regimes.\" 1 6 These regimes were to be based on
the starting point of \"mutual recognition,\" which entailed an
\"embrace of common values surrounding privacy and personal data
protection.\" 1 7 The extent of EU-U.S. data privacy interoperability,
however, remains to be seen. In exploring this issue, this Article
analyzes the respective legal identities constructed around data privacy
in the EU and the United States. It identifies profound differences in
the two systems\' image of the individual as bearer of legal interests.
[The [EU]{.mark} has created a privacy [culture around \"rights]{.mark}
talk\" that serves to protect \"data subjects.]{.underline}\" 8 In the
EU, rights talk forms a critical part of the postwar European project of
creating the identity of a European citizen. As Jirgen Habermas argues,
this task is a constitutional one that is central to the EU\'s
survival.19 [In the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, [[by contrast]{.underline}]{.mark}, data
privacy law is based on the idea of consumers whose interests merit
governmental protection in a marketplace marked by deception and
unfairness. In the United States, [the [focus]{.mark} is [on
\"marketplace]{.mark} discourse\"]{.underline} about personal
information and the safeguarding of \"privacy consumers. \"20 This
Article uses the models of rights talk and marketplace discourse to
analyze how the EU and United States protect their respective data
subjects and privacy consumers. A focus of the Article is on the
[respective doctrines of consent and contract in the two legal
systems]{.underline}, which [reflect **[profoundly
different]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[**[perspectives]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In the EU, there is a
collective approach to ordering privacy. Consequently, the EU limits
contract through strict requirements of necessity, purpose limitation,
and a ban on \"tying.\" 21 As for consent, it is subject to limits in
the EU that make it unusable in many areas as a legal basis for personal
data processing. [Where the focus of the EU is on restricting consent
and contract, these doctrines are absent in U.S. data privacy
law.]{.underline} In the absence of a requirement of a legal
justification for personal data processing, [parties in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [can collect and use personal
data without consent or contract]{.underline}.22 Their only duty is to
follow any sector laws or other mandates that might exist. [There
[are]{.mark} also likely [future forces for convergence]{.mark} and
divergence on the horizon.]{.underline} The forces moving the two legal
systems for privacy together are a shared technological environment,
increased political agreement around the benefits of personal data flow,
and common security and law enforcement concerns. [The forces moving the
systems apart begin with the political and institutional dimensions of
the EU\'s rights talk. There are also great differences concerning
privacy remedies and a [strong possibility for]{.mark} misunderstandings
and [disagreements]{.mark} around concepts of contract and consent in
the two systems.]{.underline}

## AI

### 1nc Ideological Divide

#### AI enforcement through NATO [foundationally fails]{.underline} --- there's too much divergence.

\[TITLE\]: "[[NATO wants]{.underline}]{.mark} to set [[AI
standards]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[If only its members agreed **on the
basics**]{.underline}]{.mark}." [**Big [differences]{.mark}**
[over]{.mark} how to treat **[a]{.mark}**utonomous
**[w]{.mark}**eapon**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} could [[undermine]{.mark}
**NATO's [drive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[On paper]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[NATO is]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[ideal]{.underline}]{.mark}
organization [to go]{.underline} about [setting standards
for]{.underline} military applications of [artificial
intelligence]{.underline}. [[But]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**widely
[divergent]{.mark}** [priorities and budgets]{.mark} of]{.underline} its
[30 members]{.underline} could [[get in the way]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The Western military alliance has identified artificial intelligence as
a key technology needed to maintain an edge over adversaries, and it
wants to lead the way in establishing common ground rules for its use.
"We need each other more than ever. No country alone or no continent
alone can compete in this era of great power competition," NATO Deputy
Secretary-General Mircea Geoană, the alliance's second in command, said
in an interview with POLITICO. The standard-setting effort comes as
China is pressing ahead with AI applications in the military largely
free of democratic oversight. David van Weel, NATO's assistant secretary
general for emerging security challenges, said Beijing\'s lack of
concern with the tech\'s ethical implications has sped along the
integration of AI into the military apparatus. \"I\'m \... not sure that
they\'re having the same debates on principles of responsible use or
they\'re definitely not applying our democratic values to these
technologies," he said. Meanwhile, the EU --- which has pledged to roll
out the world\'s first binding rules on AI in coming weeks --- is
seeking [**closer collaboration** with Washington to oversee emerging
technologies]{.underline}, [including **a**rtificial
**i**ntelligence]{.underline}. But those [[efforts]{.mark} have been
[slow]{.mark} in getting off the ground]{.underline}. For Geoană, that
collaboration will happen at NATO, which is working closely with the
European Union as it prepares AI regulation focusing on "high risk"
applications. The pitch NATO does not regulate, but "once NATO sets a
standard, it becomes in terms of defensive security the gold standard in
that respective field," Geoană said. The alliance\'s own AI strategy, to
be released before the summer, will identify ways to operate AI systems
responsibly, identify military applications for the technology, and
provide a "platform for allies to test their AI to see whether it\'s up
to NATO standards," van Weel said. The strategy will also set ethical
guidelines around how to govern AI systems, for example by ensuring
systems can be shut down by a human at all times, and to maintain
accountability by ensuring a human is responsible for the actions of AI
systems. "If an adversary would use autonomous AI powered systems in a
way that is not compatible with our values and morals, it would still
have defense implications because we would need to defend and deter
against those systems," van Weel said. "We need to be aware of that and
we need to flag legislators when we feel that our restrictions are
coming into the realm of \[being detrimental to\] our defense and
deterrence," he continued. **[[Mission
impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}**? The [problem is]{.underline} that
[[NATO\'s members]{.mark} are [at **very different stages**]{.mark} when
it comes to]{.underline} thinking about [AI in the military
context]{.underline}. The
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}.[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}., the world\'s biggest
military spender, has [[prioritized]{.underline}]{.mark} the [use of

[[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}, most [countries]{.underline} --- France
and the Netherlands excepting --- [**[barely mention]{.mark}** the
technology's defense and military implications]{.underline} in their
national AI strategies. "It's absolutely no surprise that the U.S. had a

[while]{.underline} others like [[Belgium and

[concerns]{.mark}**]{.underline} about the technology. These [weapons

opposition**]{.underline} from civil society and human rights groups,
including from United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, who in
2018 called for a ban.

) PJW

[The issue of data privacy is]{.underline} often [among the first risks
that come to mind in relation to artificial intelligence, since
developing, testing and implementing AI technologies often involve the
processing of personal data.]{.underline} According to Dentons' AI
survey, [81 percent of respondents cited personal data protection as a
significant concern.]{.underline}

[Users of [AI tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline} that operate in the
European Union or [[that serve]{.mark}]{.underline} customers in
[[Europe need to be aware of]{.mark} the [EU data protection]{.mark}
framework]{.underline}, including notably the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). In addition, on April 21, 2021, the [European
Commission published its "Proposal for a Regulation]{.underline} of the
European Parliament and of the Council laying [down harmonized rules on
Artificial Intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act)]{.underline} and
amending certain Union legislative acts" (the Draft AI Act -- available
here, in English as well as other EU languages; the Slovenian Presidency
of the Council of the European Union published its compromise text on
November 29, 2021---available here, in English), [which also has
important data protection implications.]{.underline}

A risk-based approach to privacy

[Both the GDPR and the Draft AI Act take a risk-based approach to
privacy.]{.underline}

[According to the GDPR, where the processing of personal data is likely
to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals
(which may be the case when AI systems are used), the controller is
required to carry out a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) to
evaluate the likelihood and severity of that risk. It must then
determine]{.underline} possible [mitigating measures.]{.underline}

Similarly, the Draft AI Act distinguishes uses of AI that create (i) an
unacceptable risk, (ii) a high risk, and (iii) low or minimal risk.
[[Providers of AI systems]{.mark} that are likely to pose high risks to
the safety or fundamental rights of individuals [must conduct an
**upfront risk assessment**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

Artificial intelligence and the right to privacy

Guido Scorza, Commissioner of the Italian Data Protection Authority

"While we cannot block the spread of artificial intelligence, we need to
govern and orient it. If we leave the market free to regulate
itself---which is largely what has happened up until now---there is a
risk that everything that is technologically possible could also be
considered legally legitimate. This cannot be the case in our democratic
societies.

Fundamental rights, starting with [the right to privacy, must represent
a natural constraint in the design and implementation of artificial
intelligence solutions and must be inoculated by design and by
default.]{.underline}

In a large part, the General Data Protection Regulation marks this path
and equips supervisory authorities with tools to enforce the rules.
Adding to this, I believe [we should extend the obligation to respect
the same principles of privacy by design and by default to manufacturers
of smart devices and smart service providers. This would avoid the risk
that data controllers and data processors]{.underline} could have
instruments to [circumvent European rules on data
protection."]{.underline}

In their joint opinion on the Draft AI Act, the [European Data
Protection Supervisor (EDPS) and the European Data Protection Board
(EDPB) stressed that the classification of an AI system as "high-risk"
creates a presumption of "high-risk" under the GDPR as well. This will
trigger the need for a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) in
addition to the conformity assessment under the Draft AI
Act.]{.underline}

[As risk assessments and DPIAs stem from different regulations,
[businesses should not assume that a]{.mark} High-Risk [AI
System]{.mark} (or HRAIS) [that is admissible under the]{.mark} Draft
[AI Act is]{.mark} therefore [also lawful under]{.mark} the [GDPR. This
will require a **separate legal analysis**]{.mark},]{.underline}
although the tools used for DPIAs may be revised to be suitable for the
risk assessment under the Draft AI Act as well. Users of AI systems may
use the information from the AI risk assessment done by the provider of
the AI system as input for their DPIA.

81% of respondents cited personal data protection as a challenge to
implementing AI.

Prohibited uses of AI

Separately to the HRAIS, the [Draft [AI Act sets out]{.mark} a list of
"[prohibited AI practices]{.mark}." Businesses should be aware that
certain broadly described practices are prohibited, unless a statutory
exception applies. The following uses are examples of prohibited AI
practices:]{.underline}

Use of an AI system deploying subliminal components or resulting in
exploiting any vulnerabilities of a specific group of persons---due to
their age, disability or social-economic situation---to materially
distort behavior and cause physical or psychological harm;

Any type of social scoring practices that could lead to discriminatory
outcomes and the exclusion of a certain group.

In this context, we note that the compromise text of the Draft AI Act,
released on November 29, 2021 by the [Slovenia]{.underline}n Presidency
of the Council of the European Union, [broadens the scope of prohibited
AI practices, [including]{.mark} by prohibiting real-time (and not only
remote) [biometric identification of individuals in public]{.mark}ly
accessible [spaces by law enforcement]{.mark} authorities or on their
behalf (except in specific circumstances)]{.underline} and social
scoring practices performed over a certain period of time, regardless
whether by public authorities or private actors. Previously, only the
public sector was targeted.

High-Risk AI Systems

The updated text of the [Draft AI Act also provides for a comprehensive
list of HRAIS. Businesses should be aware of the use of AI
systems]{.underline} (non-exhaustive) that are:

[Intended to be [used for]{.mark} the [recruitment]{.mark} or selection
of natural persons, notably for advertising vacancies, screening or
filtering applications;]{.underline}

[Intended for [making decisions on promotions and terminations]{.mark}
of work-related contractual relationships, for task allocation based on
individual behavior or personal traits or characteristics, and for
monitoring and [evaluating performance]{.mark} and behavior of persons
in such relationships;]{.underline}

[intended to be used to evaluate the creditworthiness of natural persons
or establish their credit score]{.underline}, with the exception of AI
systems put into service by small-scale providers for their own use;

[intended to be used for setting insurance premiums, underwriting and
assessing claims.]{.underline}

AI system providers located outside the EU

[An important [obligation for providers]{.mark} located [outside the
E]{.mark}]{.underline}uropean [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nion [offering AI
systems in the EU [will be to appoint]{.mark} by written mandate [an
authorized representative]{.mark} established [in the EU.]{.mark} The
GDPR has a similar obligation]{.underline}, which is regularly
overlooked. It will be interesting to see if providers will be able [[to
find representatives]{.mark} willing to take on the responsibilities
conferred upon them under]{.underline} the [Draft AI Act]{.underline}.
For [GDPR]{.underline} representatives, it has been our experience that
this [[is **not**]{.mark} **always [easy]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area

The [use of [AI]{.mark} technologies in many cases [involves
cross-border transfers of]{.mark} personal [data]{.mark}. Where personal
data is transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA) to a country
outside the EEA, the GDPR sets additional requirements.]{.underline}
Businesses will have to implement a transfer mechanism (such as the new
Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission). They
will also need to assess those laws and practices in the third country
related to access by public authorities to the transferred personal
data. They may be further required to implement supplementary measures
on top of the Standard Contractual Clauses.

[Outside the EEA, more and more [countries are adopting stricter rules
on cross-border data transfers]{.mark}, including the obligations to
obtain consent, ensure contractual safeguards and to follow data
localization requirements.]{.underline}

Transparency

[[Transparency of]{.mark} personal [data processing is one of]{.mark}
the [GDPR's key principles,]{.mark} and this principle applies in full
to any AI technologies]{.underline} that process such data. [**Achieving
the required level of [transparency can be a challenge with
AI]{.mark}**, thanks to its highly technical and complex nature, making
it [difficult to understand how data is processed]{.mark} through the
system.]{.underline} In addition, personal data is processed in AI
systems in two ways: Data serves as an input (e.g. to learn), and the AI
system produces data as an output. [Some AI systems]{.underline} then
[use]{.underline} that [output data to make [automated
decisions]{.mark}]{.underline} [in]{.mark} individual cases (such as in
evaluations of creditworthiness). [This may [trigger additional]{.mark}
GDPR [requirements]{.mark} around automated decision-making; moreover,
it requires users of an AI system to be mindful of the different ways
the AI system can process personal data.]{.underline}

Furthermore, individuals may not always expect (let alone understand)
the different ways an AI system processes their personal data. For this
reason, it is crucial to provide users in advance with concise,
transparent, intelligible information, in an easily accessible form, and
using clear and plain language. [Transparency is not just a GDPR
requirement. The Draft AI Act contains separate transparency
obligations, such as to ensure that AI systems intended to interact with
natural persons are designed and developed in such a way that natural
persons are informed that they are interacting with an AI
system]{.underline} (unless this is obvious from the circumstances and
the context of use).

#### AI cooperation can't get past the [AI cop]{.underline} -- massive restrictions, inspections, public opposition

Natalia **Drozdiak 21** - EU Reporter on Foreign Policy and NATO.
("Europe Is Already Policing Privacy. AI Could Be Next," Bloomberg,
04/13/2021,
<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-04-13/europe-is-already-policing-privacy-ai-could-be-next>
) PJW

Hey everyone, it\'s Natalia. [[Europe is already the world's tech
privacy cop. Now it **might become the AI cop
too**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Companies [using **a**]{.mark}]{.underline}rtificial
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence [[in the EU]{.mark} could soon
be [required to get audited]{.mark} first]{.underline}, under new rules
set to be proposed by the European Union as soon as next week.

The regulations were partly sketched out in an EU white paper last year
and aim to ensure the responsible application of AI in high-stakes
situations like autonomous driving, remote surgery or predictive
policing. Officials want to ensure that such systems are trained on
privacy-protecting and diverse data sets.

The proposal comes as [[AI]{.mark} capabilities]{.underline} are woven
into everything from online shopping, to music recommendations and even
fever detection and other Covid-screening technologies rolled out during
the pandemic. The technology is advancing innovation but it's also
[increasingly [**setting off alarms** around]{.mark} discrimination,
misuse, [privacy]{.mark} and other issues.]{.underline}

Facial recognition is particularly controversial. China has been accused
of human rights abuses in Xinjiang, where it's targeted the Uighur
population using scanning systems. Meanwhile, some civil liberties
groups warn of the dangers of discrimination or mistaken identities when
law enforcement uses the technology, which sometimes misidentifies women
and people with darker skin tones.

Dozens of [[digital rights groups]{.mark} are [urging the EU to]{.mark}
ban certain uses of facial recognition tools in Europe]{.underline},
pointing to increased use of the technology by public and private actors
despite the bloc's strict privacy rules. "We are deeply concerned about
the dramatic increase in the deployment of biometric technologies all
across Europe that pave the way for indiscriminate mass surveillance,"
said Friederike Reinhold, a senior policy advisor at AlgorithmWatch.
"[We see an **urgent need to [draw red lines]{.mark}**
here]{.underline}."

[The [EU]{.mark} could be [leaning toward answering]{.mark} those
[pleas]{.mark}.]{.underline} In a March letter to members of the
European parliament obtained by Bloomberg, [European Commission
President Ursula von der Leyen spelled out plans for mandatory rules for
high-risk AI]{.underline}, adding that "in the case of applications that
would be simply incompatible with fundamental rights, we may need to go
further."

But [any new rules could clash with another major EU goal:
boosting]{.underline} its [prowess in advanced technologies like
AI]{.underline} to better compete with the U.S. and China. The EU is
already planning direct equity investments in early stage AI and other
technology startups via its 3 billion-euro venture capital fund.

If the EU's rules get passed, some [[systems]{.mark} could [face delays
as they undergo]{.mark} the [checks. It's]{.mark} also [unclear whether
Europe]{.mark}'s member states [have enough AI talent]{.mark} on-hand
[to routinely carry out sophisticated inspections]{.mark} of the
technology involved.]{.underline}

EU officials seem to be making the bet that slowing down AI development
will ultimately yield a safer, more sustainable technology. The risk, of
course, it that someone else will make it first.

#### Germany ensures restrictive AI measures

places," POLITICO, 09/24/2021,

[[Germany\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} incoming [[government is **throwing
its weight behind a ban** on]{.mark} the use of [biometric
id]{.mark}entification [tech]{.mark}nologies such as facial recognition
[in public places]{.mark}.]{.underline} According to their coalition
deal, the Social Democrats (SPD), Greens and liberal Free Democrats
(FDP) want to \"exclude\" biometric recognition in public spaces as well
as automated state scoring systems by AI through European law.
\"Biometric recognition in public spaces as well as automated state
scoring systems by AI are to be excluded under European law,\" reads the
coalition agreement, presented on Wednesday. [The [EU\'s
**A**]{.mark}rtificial **[I]{.mark}**ntelligence
[Act]{.mark}]{.underline}, proposed in April, creates product safety
rules for "high risk" AI that is likely to cause harm to humans. It also
[bans certain "unacceptable" AI uses, such as social scoring and
restricts the use of remote biometric identification in public places
from law enforcement,]{.underline} unless it is to fight serious crime,
such as terrorism. The AI Act\'s prohibitions are some of the bill\'s
most contentious articles, and many European countries have yet to
decide what they think. [[Germany\'s support]{.mark} of a ban [could
**rally other countries to the same view**. Belgium and Slovakia]{.mark}
have [already expressed]{.mark} their [support]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Some EU countries, such as France, are worried that a ban on facial
recognition would weaken national security. [Members of the [European
Parliament]{.mark} have [also called for a full ban on facial
recognition]{.mark} in public places.]{.underline} \"[The clear \'no\'
to biometric surveillance in public spaces]{.underline} and additionally
the right to anonymity online and offline as well as the right to
encryption [are a [paradigm shift in]{.mark} the [German discussion
about AI. This will be]{.mark} very welcomed [support for the]{.mark}
upcoming negotiations on the [AI Act]{.mark}]{.underline},\" said German
MEP Svenja Hahn, who belongs to the FDP and is one of the co-negotiators
of the AI Act in the Parliament\'s internal market committee.

Operations and Decision-Making\"

[Despite the surge in international attention on AI, **not all states
have developed robust AI capabilities, particularly for military
applications**]{.underline}. One recent study finds significant
variation in the capacity of states to "exploit the innovative potential
of AI" for government purposes.51 States like the United Kingdom,
Germany, and the United States receive high marks for AI readiness,
while other allies like Spain, Turkey, and Montenegro fall lower on the
readiness scale.52 This unequal distribution of AI technology can result
from differences in the organizational, financial, and human capital
available to develop and deploy new technologies and differences in
political support for the use of AI.53 Uneven distribution of AI
technologies has important implications for the ability of allies and
partners to divide military tasks during crises. [Variation in the
capacity to adopt and integrate AI technology into state militaries can
create AI "haves" and "have-nots." Some states --- like Germany ---
possess a robust technology sector, have the financial resources to fund
research and acquisitions, and maintain defense bureaucracies that are
sufficiently skilled and flexible to integrate new AI
technologies.]{.underline}54 Indeed, many of these states have created
government institutions to manage military AI development. The United
States, for example, established the Joint Artificial Intelligence
Center in 2018 to coordinate the Defense Department's AI programs.55
Other states lack these resources and are unable to rigorously pursue
new AI capabilities. For instance, [many of NATO's economically weaker
members have focused their defense spending on modernizing conventional
forces and updating Cold War-era hardware, and not on AI
development]{.underline}.56 [Even if a state has the resources to
develop AI capabilities, limited public support for AI-enabled military
systems can hamper such efforts.]{.underline} Opposition can stem from
the uncertainty surrounding AI's functionality, or from moral and
ethical objections to delegating decisions on the use of force to
computers. One recent cross-national survey, for instance, finds
significant public disapproval of the use of lethal autonomous weapons
among key U.S. allies. To be sure, autonomous weapons and AI are
distinct, but [AI is incorporated into the software architecture of most
autonomous systems, and pundits and the public often conflate the two.57
In South Korea and **Germany**, 74 and 72 percent of the local
populations, respectively, **oppose their use**]{.underline} (compared
to 52 percent opposition among the U.S. public).58 These two countries
are close U.S. allies that host dozens of U.S. military installations
and over 60,000 American troops.[**59 In addition to creating obstacles
to the conduct of multinational military operations**, **AI** can also
**strain** the **ability** of alliance leaders **to make decisions
during a crisis.**]{.underline} Alliance decision-making is often
characterized as a contentious process in which policymakers from states
with different national interests, military capabilities, and risk
tolerances coordinate their preferences.86 [Policymakers seek to advance
their state's own interests during deliberations, frequently leading to
negotiated policy compromises]{.underline}. NATO allies, for instance,
routinely have policy disagreements --- take, for instance, clashes over
the response to Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal in 1956 and
over the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.[87 Alliances and coalitions are
also fraught with commitment problems, where states fear that allies
will back out of agreements or drag them into unwanted
conflicts.]{.underline}88 Divergent national positions and fears of
abandonment can lead decision-making consultations between states to be
drawn out, and, if conducted in the midst of a crisis, **[leave
alliances unable to respond decisively to threats]{.underline}**.89

### 1nc Norms Fail LAWS

#### Intl norms fail for LAWs

//CYang

So far, the [[international community]{.mark} has
**[attempted]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [[and
**failed**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[to regulate
LAWS]{.underline}]{.mark}. In December 2021, after eight years of
technical discussions, government and civil society representatives met
at the U.N. in Geneva to set an agenda for regulating LAWS for the first
time in what was billed as a "historic opportunity." Most attendees
favored legally binding rules that apply equally to all states to govern
the development and use of these technologies. Yet, by any standard, the
meeting failed. Despite years of preparatory discussions within the
framework of the U.N. Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW)
--- a forum for restricting the use of weapons considered to cause
unnecessary or unjustifiable suffering to combatants or to affect
civilians indiscriminately --- the attendees barely managed to agree on
10 more days of discussion this March and July. This outcome was to be
expected given the positions of the major powers and the CCW rules
requiring consensus before action is taken. (Disclosure: Both authors
have been affiliated with the CCW.) In response, a wide array of actors
--- from Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch to some of the
states in favor of a LAWS ban, including Argentina and the Philippines
--- are calling for a process to develop legally binding prohibitions on
these weapons outside of the CCW. Alternative approaches to prohibition
treaties have had some success in the past, such as when countries
agreed to give up land mines through the 1997
[[Ottawa]{.underline}]{.mark} convention; cluster munitions through the
2008 [[Oslo]{.mark} Accords]{.underline}; and even nuclear weapons
through the 2017 [Treaty o**[n]{.mark}** the
**[P]{.mark}**rohibi**[t]{.mark}**ion of Nuclear Weapons]{.underline},
which was the first treaty to completely ban nuclear weapons in line
with international humanitarian law and establish pathways for current
nuclear weapon states to renounce them. However, [[while]{.mark} many
[states signed]{.mark}]{.underline} these treaties, [most of the
**[powerful]{.mark} states** [did not]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Unfortunately, [[even]{.underline}]{.mark} this **[[limited
success]{.underline}]{.mark}** is [likely to be [elusive in the case of
LAWS]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [primary reason]{.underline} is that
[[states]{.underline}]{.mark} are [increasingly
[aware]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[these]{.mark} non-substitutable
[technologies]{.mark}]{.underline} may [become]{.underline} [[crucial to
their security and are]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[unlikely
to]{.underline}]{.mark} unilaterally [[abandon
them]{.underline}]{.mark}. If [states']{.underline} adversaries have
them, they [will]{.underline} likely [believe they need
them]{.underline} --- [and]{.underline} absent the sort of
nonproliferation regime that exists for nuclear weapons, their
adversaries will, in fact, [continue to **rapidly develop**]{.underline}
LAWS without much oversight. Nonproliferation has yet to receive much
attention in the case of LAWS, but it has worked to varying degrees in
the past with the missile technology control regime, biological weapons,
chemical weapons, and, of course, nuclear weapons. The landmark
Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty (NPT), which entered into
force in 1970, met the requirements of major and lesser powers: It did
not require those who possessed nuclear weapons to renounce them
immediately, allowed other states access to the benefits of civilian use
of nuclear power, and relied on a trusted international organization
that was charged with the dual responsibility of promoting and
controlling nuclear technology. A similar nonproliferation regime for
LAWS could facilitate regulation of their development, transfer, and
employment --- even by the powers that do not give them up. It would
reduce the use of these technologies for authoritarian control and
terrorist actions worldwide and, as in the nuclear case, create the
possibility of developing norms against LAWS use that apply to all. This
would admittedly be complicated. The nuclear nonproliferation regime has
thus far been largely successful because it has been a central pillar of
major powers' grand strategies. Indeed, detente in the Cold War involved
superpowers agreeing to police proliferation in their spheres of
influence. Security guarantees mollified countries that otherwise would
have felt too insecure to forgo nuclear weapons. Threats and promises
convinced countries, such as Iran when it signed the Joint Comprehensive
Plan of Action, to accept stricter limits on its nuclear program than it
would have otherwise. [Without this]{.underline} focused attention,
[nonproliferation]{.underline} and arms embargo [[regimes **regularly
fail**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indeed, the [**[a]{.mark}**utonomous
**[w]{.mark}**eapon**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} used [[in
Libya]{.underline}]{.mark} were [[exported by Turkey]{.mark} in
violation of a U.N. **arms embargo**]{.underline}. A successful LAWS
nonproliferation regime would thus require states to prioritize the
issue more than they currently do in their national security strategies,
especially as the technologies become more widespread and effective.
[[Another issue]{.underline}]{.mark} that all nonproliferation regimes
face [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[dual-use]{.mark} nature** of
[technology]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a striking example, in December
2020, the U.S. [Air Force employed]{.underline} an algorithm called
MuZero to select targets for missile strikes in a training exercise.
MuZero was developed and made public by [DeepMind,]{.underline} a
subsidiary of Google's parent company, Alphabet, which has pledged not
to work on autonomous weapons. Although DeepMind [showcased]{.underline}
its algorithm [by training computers to play]{.underline} games like
[chess and Go]{.underline} at superhuman levels, the U.S. [Air Force's
use]{.underline} of the technology [raised concerns about using
DeepMind's work for]{.underline} more [lethal purposes]{.underline}.
Existing nonproliferation regimes try to address this problem through
targeted export restriction agreements for dual-use technologies. The
Australia Group provides a model for this: Its 43 countries coordinate
export limitations on technologies that facilitate biological or
chemical weapons development. Although this hasn't halted proliferation
entirely, it has arguably slowed its pace. The problem of
[[restricting]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[spread of
software]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[which can be
copied]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[is **even more**
difficult]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is important because many actors
could pair autonomy-enabling software with commercially available
hardware to produce weapons easily.

### 1nc Biotech Norms Fail

#### Norms fail to regulate biotech military application

Classification And Obligations\";
https://finabel.org/the-bio-enhanced-soldier-in-international-law-classification-and-obligations/;

The first obligation is that the weapon under review would discriminate
accurately enough to only target combatants or to be used against
legitimate military targets. The second obligation is proportionality,
meaning that the use of a weapon must be proportional to the military
objective and must keep civilian casualties to a minimum. The final
obligation is to avoid unnecessary suffering. This, however, can be
rather [[problematic when it comes to]{.underline}]{.mark}
countermeasures against [**[enhanced soldiers]{.mark}** as]{.underline}
the [[standards]{.underline}]{.mark} neutralising personnel [[are
different]{.mark} from]{.underline} those governing
[material]{.underline}. [[If]{.mark} the reinforced
[soldier]{.mark}]{.underline} in question [[falls
under]{.underline}]{.mark} the category of
"[[material]{.underline}]{.mark}", then the [level of
[severity]{.mark}]{.underline} for neutralising the system [will be
[higher]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is therefore essential that a legal

### 2nc Say "No" GMOS 

#### European strict regulations reject biotechnology despite scientists' objections

**Paarlberg, 21** (Robert Paarlberg, 2-1-2021, \"Opinion: Europe Is
Sinking Biotech---Again,\" Scientist Magazine®,
<https://www.the-scientist.com/reading-frames/europe-is-sinking-biotechagain-68339>,
LASA-CSK)

[[When it comes to]{.underline}]{.mark} modern agricultural
[[biotech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}, **[[Europe's]{.mark} caution [has
been slowing]{.mark} [progress for]{.mark} more than two
[decades]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [It started]{.underline} in the 1990s,
[when Europe began rejecting crops modified]{.underline} using
recombinant DNA, or DNA from other species---crops branded as
genetically modified organisms ([GMOs]{.underline}). [Now it is doing
the same for gene-edited crops improved using CRISPR]{.underline}.
European scientists have objected to this new blockage, but they are not
the only ones paying a price. Using CRISPR, researchers are now working
to make crop plants that have higher yields, resist disease or stress,
or are tastier, more nutritious, or more convenient than conventionally
bred varieties. As farmers seek to adapt to climate change, gene editing
could become an even more valuable tool in agriculture---if regulators
will allow it. Decades ago, it was transgenic modification that seemed
poised to help increase drought tolerance, disease resistance, and crop
yields, and to curtail insecticide use. But [consumers in Europe were
scared away from the resulting GMO foods]{.underline} by activist
organizations, [while]{.underline} **[[governments stifled]{.mark} the
[products with strict regulation]{.mark}]{.underline}**; most farmers
there have never planted them. GMO consumer foods are also not imported
into Europe, due to a [burdensome tracing rule that requires all
operators in the marketplace to maintain, for five years, a record of
every single GMO they handled]{.underline}, where it came from, and
where it went. Rather than take on this logistical nightmare, food
companies in Europe reformulated their products completely away from GMO
ingredients, and those exporting to Europe now do the same or plant no
GMOs at all. In the US, where GMO regulations are more permissive,
farmers have planted GMO cotton, plus GMO corn and soybeans (mostly for
animal feed and auto fuel), but they voluntarily avoid GMO wheat, rice,
and potato, partly for fear of encountering commercial rejections in
Europe. As I discuss in my new book, Resetting the Table, **[[Europe's
policies]{.mark} [ignore a consensus among science academies]{.mark}
around the world]{.underline}**---including in Europe---that GMO crops
pose no new risks either to human health or to the environment. Even the
European Commission concurs with this view, concluding in a 2010
analysis that "biotechnology, and in particular GMOs, are not per se
more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies." [[Now
Europe's rejection of new]{.underline}]{.mark} agricultural
[[biotech]{.mark}nology [is being repeated]{.mark}]{.underline} for
gene-edited crops. First reported in 2012, [[CRISPR should have been
less]{.mark} [controversial]{.mark} than transgenic work because it does
not rely on bringing in genes from unrelated species, and it closely
resembles the natural process of genetic mutation]{.underline}. The EU's
own advocate general offered a preliminary nonbinding opinion that
CRISPR crops should not fall under the strict regulatory requirements of
Europe's GMO Directive, but **[[the European]{.mark} [Court]{.mark} of
Justice in Luxembourg]{.underline}** (the EU equivalent of the US
Supreme Court) **[[concluded]{.mark} in 2018 [that gene-edited organisms
should be regulated like GMOs]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### 2nc Say "No" France 

#### France says no -- parallel science clouds any biotech decisions

**Kuntz 14** (Marcel, is a Director of Research at CNRS but is not the
spokesman of the institution for which he works. "The GMO case in
France: Politics, lawlessness and postmodernism",
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5033180/)//LR

On April 13, [2005, MPs Jean-Yves Le Déaut and Christian Ménard16 issued
a report for the "Information Mission of the National Assembly on
GMOs]{.underline}. "Their conclusions aimed to be "nuanced and if
possible, reassuring." [The report reveals clearly the political divide
over this topic: Socialists, Communists, and of course the Greens, being
opposed to GMOs]{.underline}, whereas [the Center and the Right parties
being rather in favor (at least supportive of research),]{.underline}
with dissenting voices on each side. In an attempt to placate opponents,
the report recommended not to allow any new field trial in 2005. It also
recommended unpractical burdens on field trials, such as proposition n°
24 "to perform, during the Bt crops field trials, a study of insect
populations including bees (number, behavior, reproduction)" or new
obstacles prior to marketing, such as performing socio-economic impact
studies (as already recommended in the 2000 Aubert report, illustrating
the spread of "Green" views). The report is also embedded in typical
postmodernist views (see discussion below) such as "to involve the
public and local community representatives and associations"
(propositions 53 and 55). [**The French government moved from a
precautionary doctrine** in 1997 (which occasionally **lost sight of
science for political reasons) to the development of its own parallel
"science"**]{.underline} from 2008 onwards (again for political
reasons). While successive governments maintained [some rhetorical
support for "research on GMOs" for years, the last GMO field trial
in]{.underline} France (poplar trees as part of an INRA experiment) was
terminated on July 13, 2013 (because Minister Le Foll declined to give
an answer to an application by INRA to prolong the experimentation).
Such a drift from a precautionary approach in 1997 to a de facto ban
illustrates the impact of the precautionary principle. The official
"public debates" organized in France also moved from the objective of
providing information to the decision makers (with a direct link between
the latter and experts), and to the public, to a negotiation-type of
debate between "stakeholders" and the government, with a limited role
for experts (as was the case for [the 2007 "debate" on environment).
Public debates also became relativist in nature (scientific knowledge is
considered as an opinion just like any other opinion, a characteristic
of the postmodern ideology)]{.underline}.20 Obviously, these debates
have not appeased confrontations concerning GMOs. [On the contrary, they
have **encouraged opponents to become more radical asking for more
concessions**, until **the total eradication of GMOs**. For example, on
May 23, 2011, a group of activists invaded the agronomical research
institute (INRA) center in Angers for a "citizen inspection" of a
confined experiment using GM pears. This clear act of intimidation was
on the pretext that no dialog had been implemented.]{.underline} **[GMO
experimentation sites have gradually become a lawless area for
activists.]{.underline}** The reason is clear: the strength of the
[anti-GMO lobbies is directly correlated to the weakness of politicians.
With no more GMO fields to destroy in France, they have since started
targeting mutagenized varieties employing the same tactics as used
against GMOs]{.underline} (they call mutagenized varieties "hidden
GMOs").29 The fact that the term "genetically modified" is semantically
vague can be used by opponents to target all new breeding techniques
since their final goal is to destroy seed trade which is perceived as
"smothering peasants" (see Fig. 1A). Thus, activists have also
occasionally invaded Monsanto\'s facilities (although the company no
longer actually sells GM seeds in France) or agricultural organizations'
premises for diverse reasons but usually linked to seed business or seed
regulation. [In conclusion, **GMO cultivation in France is totally
blocked** (including field trials and GM research) for political
reasons, **with no foreseeable way to reverse this
situation**.]{.underline}

THE BATTLEFIELD: IN NEED OF A STRATEGY"
https://warontherocks.com/2018/11/biotechnology-for-the-battlefield-in-need-of-a-strategy/)LR

[Acquiring Biotech and the 'Valley of Death' **Even if all needs for
biotechnology were clear, the Defense Department would still need to
improve the way it acquires biotechnology for the battlefield**. Which
capabilities should continue to be built in the department's service
research labs, and which ought to be acquired from external
companies]{.underline}? One option is to simply adopt useful commercial
products off the shelf as they are innovated in the private sector,
particularly since many innovative biological materials can be
dual-purposed for both consumers and the military. For example, in
addition to its promise as lightweight body armor, spider silk can be
used in ordinary clothing, textiles, construction materials, and novel
medicines. Alternatively, [the Defense Department could ask the private
sector to create defense-specific products from the ground up. A third
option is to generate prototype products within the department, then use
the private sector to scale and deliver them. Right now, the inability
to scale up synthetic biology products from prototypes is a bottleneck
hindering the broad adoption of biotech]{.underline}nology and the
private sector is already investing in scaling solutions --- whether for
commercial markets or defense. While the answer is likely a combination
of all these approaches, [the Defense Department needs to communicate
clearly with biotechnology performers, since the private sector is not
likely to make choices for manufacturing products for national security
on its own]{.underline}. [The well-recognized "valley of death" that
prevents technological innovations from being translated into medicines,
equipment, and warfighter benefits is a problem much broader than
biotechnology. Since World War II, there has been a steady decline in
the defense industrial base, as fewer companies are able to provide
products specific to defense. Supply chains have become burdensome and
unwieldy]{.underline}. For example, the successful genetic engineering
of silk worms to make "dragon silk" for warfighters is promising. But
producing dragon silk at scale will require thousands of silkworms ---
which in turn require a large acreage of mulberry trees not readily
available in the United States. The company creating dragon silk hopes
to use farming cooperatives in Vietnam to resolve the problem, but this
will perpetuate the same kind of burdensome and costly supply chain that
plagues defense acquisitions --- working through foreign company
contracts and embassies, and generating potential single points of
failure through reliance on sole suppliers outside the country. [To
reduce these types of inefficiencies, defense planners must envision
biotechnology products from inception through their full development and
manufacture pathways that allow these technologies to be successfully
shepherded through nimbler and more secure industrial supply chains.
**The "valley of death" also prevents technology companies from seeing
the Defense Department as an attractive customer**]{.underline}. [The
Pentagon's traditional models for acquisition tend to be time-consuming
and less cost-effective than commercial contracts.]{.underline}
Recently, a report commissioned by the president on the state of the
U.S. industrial base described the uncertainty of federal spending, the
unintended consequences of government acquisition behavior, and the loss
of skills in the domestic workforce as "unprecedented" challenges to
defense manufacturing. America's global competitors could be closing the
technology gap because of process failures, rather than a lack of
technology talent or innovative ideas.

### 1nc Terminology

#### No Solvency -- divergent terminology makes interoperability impossible

**JANCZEWSKI 19 (**Robert Janczewski currently works at the

[[The reason]{.mark} for the tendency [to create still new terms]{.mark}
based on the root cyber [is]{.mark} the term [cyberspace]{.mark}, and
not as it could be assumed cybernetics]{.underline}. The analysis and
critical review of subject literature conducted by the authors revealed
that words formed with the prefix-cyber are very popular terms of the
turn of the 20th and 21st century. Nonetheless, regardless of their
popularity, they have not been defined with the use of commonly accepted
definitions. Different NATO member states use those concepts with varied
meanings. Thus, it is impossible to provide unequivocal referent of
cyberspace, which from the pragmatic point of view creates a barrier to
NATO's interoperability at the time of cyberspace operations. The
obvious lack of explicitness in defining terms relating to operations in
cyberspace allows to draw a conclusion that a piece of new reality
formed as a result of civilization development of societies is not
sufficiently defined and examined, if it is at all. [[Lack of]{.mark}
clear-cut [terminological c]{.mark}onvention [is a serious obstacle for
NATO's]{.mark} [interoperability]{.mark} at the time [of
operations]{.mark} run in cyberspace.]{.underline} Lack of agreement
between both the scientists and practitioners in terms of one commonly
accepted definition of a piece of reality called cyberspace contributes
to disagreement in terms of one undisputable referent of cyberspace. A
common language is the basis for proper, effective, supra-sectional
cooperation both at the time of peace and war as well as crisis
situations. It should be consistent and univocal. Partners should use
not only the same terms but also the definitions of the terms should
have strict, univocal and identical semantic scopes. [Meanwhile,
[cooperation s]{.mark}eems to be [hindered]{.mark} since [partners in
NATO use various referents of cyberspace]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
leads to the assumption that there is no agreement in terms of
operational sphere. The definitions of cyberspace observed in the USA,
Poland and Germany can be used as an example. [According to the views
held in [the US]{.mark} Armed Forces [cyberspace is a global
domain]{.mark} [within the information environment]{.mark} consisting of
the interdependent networks of information technology infrastructures
and resident data, [including]{.mark} the [Internet,
telecom]{.mark}munications [networks]{.mark}, computer systems, and
embedded processors and controllers]{.underline} \[2\]. Such definition
is also included in the latest dictionary \[3\] determining standard US
military terminology and the interrelated terminology applied in the
activity of the US Armed Forces. The military and the interrelated
concepts, alongside with their definitions, are approved by the US
Department of Defense and are destined to be used universally by all
components of the US Department of Defense. According to the definition
included in the Cybersecurity strategy [[for Germany]{.mark} \[4\]
cyberspace is the [virtual space of all infor]{.mark}mation [technology
systems]{.mark} networked at the data level worldwide. The cyberspace is
based on the Internet as a publicly accessible connection network, which
can be extended by any other data network]{.underline}. Similarly to the
German view, [[the E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion [identifies]{.mark}
cyberspace with [virtual reality]{.mark}, which is envisaged in its
definition where cyberspace as the virtual, global and common domain
within the information environment consisting of all interconnected and
interdependent networks of global, organisational, and national
information infrastructure, based on the Internet and telecommunications
networks, to be extended by other networks, computer systems and
embedded processors, and containing also stand-alone systems and
networks]{.underline} \[5\]. In the [[Polish]{.mark} doctrine cyberspace
[is understood as the space where information created by ICT
systems]{.mark} [is processed]{.mark} and [exchanged]{.mark} together
[with]{.mark} the existing [bonds]{.mark} and relations with users
\[6\].]{.underline} Where ICT systems are understood as groups of
cooperating IT devices and software which assure processing, storing, as
well as sending, and receiving of data through ICT networks with the use
of an end device proper for a given type of ICT network designed to
connect directly or indirectly to the end of the network. The above
examples show that cyberspace is understood at the same time as a
domain, space, virtual space, a virtual domain. Thus, it is difficult to
find a univocal referent. The above presented examples as well as the
authors' analysis and [critique of doctrinal documents of NATO member
countries revealed that [there are no paradigms]{.mark} in the field of
cybersecurity]{.underline}. However, [there is multitude of cyber
terminology. Concepts are given different meanings]{.underline}.
Sometimes such differences observed in them point to different referents
of the same concepts. **[[Such a state of affairs poses a barrier to the
interoperability in cyberspace. Lack of common conceptual apparatus in
unfavourable conditions can lead to the infeasibility of effective
cooperation. Lack of understanding of what is e.g. cyberspace,
cyberattack, or cyber defence can significantly impede or even preclude
the achievement of a common goal.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Taking into
consideration the above one should be aware that for 'good job' it is
well grounded to achieve a common ground of understanding. While in the
technical dimension of cybersecurity it is clear what a router, an ARP
board, an IP address, or a worm or virus is, operational concepts,
generally speaking, are not clearly cut, and more interestingly
[**[there is no agreement]{.mark}** in this field among practitioners as
well as theoreticians **[in terms of the views on this dimension of
running military operations]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Beyond]{.underline} these [basic similarities in encouraging
cybersecurity, the two sides disagree on key points.]{.underline}
[Al[though]{.mark} the [U.S. and Europe vow to coop]{.mark}erate [on
cyber]{.mark}security, the two sides' [divergent approach to data
protection threatens to undermine these ambitions]{.mark}.
[Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}, which often struggles to set common
continent-wide rules, [[employs]{.mark} a [centralized]{.mark} privacy
[regulation]{.mark}. In contrast, the [U.S. takes a fragmented
approach]{.mark}. Europe takes a tough line, treating all personal data
with the sweeping **G**]{.underline}eneral **[D]{.underline}**ata
**[P]{.underline}**rotection **[R]{.underline}**egulation. [The U.S.
prefers to judge]{.underline} harm [case by case.]{.underline} [A
fundamental philosophical gulf explains these differences. [Europe
focuses on protecting personal data]{.mark}, ensuring that individuals
retain control.]{.underline} Data privacy and protection are pillars of
the European Union charter and the EU is adopting a comprehensive Data
Strategy. [The [U.S. prefers]{.mark} a [laissez-faire]{.mark} approach.
Data privacy legislation remains limited to the state level]{.underline}
(witness California's privacy law) [or industry by
industry.]{.underline} The U.S. Federal Data Strategy sets a foundation
for collecting and using data in federal agencies, without cross-agency
data centralization. Both Europe and the U.S. do at least agree on the
urgency of the cybersecurity challenge. Recent hacks of critical
infrastructure at SolarWinds, Colonial Pipeline, and NotPetya highlight
a common transatlantic vulnerability. Ubiquitous IoT devices and smart
infrastructure create a growing danger of cyberattacks. In response,
Europe and the U.S have established cybersecurity agencies. The EU has
set up the Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA). The U.S.
has the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA). These agencies
urge both governments and businesses to deploy what Europe calls "state
of the art" security and the U.S. designates "industry best practices."
[Beyond]{.underline} these [basic similarities in encouraging
cybersecurity, [the two]{.mark} sides [disagree on key points.
Europe]{.mark}'s NIS Directive [mandates the private sector]{.mark} to
[take]{.mark} concrete [actions]{.mark}. The [U.S]{.mark}.'s
[NIST]{.mark} Framework [limits itself to urging voluntary
action]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Certification represents another dividing
line. The [EU wants ENISA to "certify" cyber]{.mark}security
[preparedness]{.mark}. The U.S. has not acted on certification and some
[U.S]{.mark}. tech companies [say certification monitoring]{.mark} could
be dangerous, [open]{.mark}ing up [systems to
attacks]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Perhaps the most crucial divergence
concerns incident reporting. When a company discovers a hack, when
should they be required to report it to regulators and
customers?]{.underline} If it goes public before facts are clear, it
risks spreading incomplete or even false information -- and sparking an
unneeded panic. Report too late, though, and the untreated danger could
spread. [The two sides' [divergent privacy policies result in a
**dangerous split**]{.mark} to deal with this dilemma. [Europe
imposes]{.mark} a [high]{.mark}, centralized [standard to report]{.mark}
data [breaches]{.mark}, with a single set of rules for all companies. If
an individuals' data is divulged, the individual must be informed --
full stop.]{.underline} [[The U.S]{.mark}., as with privacy protections,
[is less stringent]{.mark}.]{.underline} Under many state laws,
[companies are not required to notify consumers until, after a
"reasonable" investigation, it is determined that customers have
suffered actual harm.]{.underline}

### 1nc Norms Fail

#### Cybersecurity norms fail -- the state centric foundation of international law has made it obsolete

**Katagiri, 21** (Nori Katagiri, M.A., Columbia University, M.A.,
University of Pennsylvania, Ph.D., University of Pennsylvania, professor
of political science, 18-2-2021, \" Why international law and norms do
little in preventing non-state cyber attacks\" Journal of Cybersecurity,
<https://doi.org/10.1093/cybsec/tyab009>, LASA-CSK)

This article exposes at least two ironies, one regarding international
law and the other about cyberspace norms. The first irony is that
[[international law has promoted]{.mark} state [centrism]{.mark} for so
many years [that]{.mark}, once in the cyber age[,
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [very]{.mark} [legal [foundation]{.mark} that
is supposed to protect states [has become the]{.mark} major
[obstacle]{.mark}]{.underline} to promoting state security.
[The]{.underline} other [irony is about norm politics]{.underline};
**[[major powers in cybersecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- especially
the [**[USA, Russia, and China]{.mark}**, each of [which]{.mark} have
[promoted norms]{.mark}]{.underline} -- **[[have
been]{.underline}]{.mark}** among **[[the greatest
violators]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This article suggests that all kinds
of moral charges can be made about embedded hypocrisy and the double
standard of words and deeds. Worse, [[these]{.mark} powerful [states
are]{.mark} not just violating each other's norms but [creating
a]{.mark} strategic [environment that permits norm contestation]{.mark}
[and overlooks]{.mark} further [violations]{.mark}]{.underline},
including those committed by nonstate actors. The hypocrisies, however,
precisely underscore the true state of cybersecurity where power and
interest forge around powerful states, and [**[there is limited space
for]{.mark} international law and [norms to play]{.mark} a** larger
**role [in regulating]{.mark}** their
**[behavior]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This article indicates the need for
the reconsideration of state commitment to the existing international
legal and norm system as a preventive mechanism against nonstate OCO.
Space limitation precludes further discussions of specific policies on
international law and norms beyond the ones that I presented above. This
analysis, however, provides a sufficient narrative that reform is
necessary for the international system to be effective against nonstate
OCO. It is apparent that cyberspace norms -- especially principles like
those of distinction, due diligence, and proportionality -- must be
updated to reflect the growing influence of nonstate actors in
cyberspace. At the same time, it remains true that [**[states have
sought to reform the system and make norms robust]{.mark}** over the
years **[without]{.mark} achieving [meaningful
change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Rather than promoting international law
and norms as a means of preventing cyberattacks, [states]{.mark} and
private actors [are likely to]{.mark} [depend]{.mark} more [on
themselves]{.mark} to prevent nonstate attacks]{.underline}. For one,
scholars have called for a variety of active defense countermeasures to
be adopted. A reasonable action we can expect states to take is the
consideration of how international law and norms can aid state conduct
of active defense in cyberspace. In this context, what is required is a
series of examinations regarding what specific aspects of international
law ought to be reformed and which one of the many ideas and principles
can be facilitated to generate more effects than before.

### 2nc Norms Fail

#### US can't shape cyber norms

to 2019, she was cyber adviser to the director of policy planning at the
U.S. Department of State (Emily, "From Reaction to Action: Adopting a

America's approach to building cyber norms should adapt to the following
realities. **[First]{.underline}**, [the United States is not in a
hegemonic position to define the agenda for norms in
cyberspace]{.underline}. [For a single actor to set the public agenda
and drive a convergence of behavior, it would need to have control over
the primary incentives and disincentives within the system, which the
United States **does not possess**]{.underline}. Nor is there a clear
manner in which the United States could obtain such primary control, due
to the highly diffuse nature of cyberspace. [**Second**, what is and
what is not currently acceptable varies greatly depending on national
perspectives, even among liberal democratic states]{.underline}. Despite
the stated desire of the United States to establish norms through
international cooperation, such norms have not emerged. The result is
intense competition to drive a convergence of expectations on behavior
in cyberspace. An alternative yet related approach to building norms is
to model good behavior. Convergence of norms will occur over time as
other actors see that more beneficial outcomes flow from modelled good
behavior than from bad behavior. This approach presents several
challenges. First, behavior that might be categorized as unacceptable
still produces benefits that outweigh costs. Second, [adversaries cite
various allegations of American bad behavior in cyberspace --- global
surveillance and the Stuxnet hack of the Iranian nuclear program are two
examples --- in labeling the United States a hypocritical
standard-bearer for norms]{.underline}. Third, [as both state and
nonstate actors continue to advance their interests through behaviors
that the United States considers unacceptable, modelling can easily be
misunderstood as tacit acceptance]{.underline}.41

### 1nc ILAW Fails

#### International law fails -- cybersecurity is distinct from conventional warfare

**Fischerkeller, 6/20** (Michael P. Fischerkeller, 6-20-2022, \"Current
International Law Is Not an Adequate Regime for Cyberspace,\" Lawfare,
<https://www.lawfareblog.com/current-international-law-not-adequate-regime-cyberspace>,
LASA-CSK)

[States increasingly agree that **[international
law]{.mark}**]{.underline}, specifically the U.N. Charter and rules of
customary international law (CIL) derived from the charter's principles,
applies to cyberspace. Yet both are [a **[poor fit for cyber]{.mark}
activities**]{.underline}. The charter reflects a bias toward what has
been termed the conventional strategic environment, and [[CIL]{.mark}
has [evolved in]{.mark} the]{.underline} shadow of both the
[[conventional and nuclear environments]{.underline}]{.mark}. In these
environments, states threaten international stability by seeking
strategic gains through either coercion or brute force. [The
[cyber]{.mark} strategic environment [differs]{.mark} in that threats to
stability derive from exploitation]{.underline}---that is, states
unilaterally using code to take advantage of others' cyber
vulnerabilities for the purpose of realizing strategic gains. It should
be unsurprising, then, [that states have struggled to offer
comprehensive and in-depth opinio juris on how international law applies
to the cyber context.]{.underline} [**[States will struggle to find
cyber relevance in international law]{.mark}** until new instruments of
international law]{.underline}---or adaptations of current
law---[account for the core features of the cyber strategic
environment]{.underline}, the state behaviors they obligate, and how
strategic advantage can be achieved lawfully and unlawfully through
those behaviors. The rule of nonintervention is a good candidate for
adaptation. Strategic Environments Cyber persistence theory, which
informs U.S. Cyber Command's doctrine of persistent engagement, is
premised on the argument that [cyberspace is not merely a domain but a
strategic environment]{.underline}---and, [importantly, one distinct
from the nuclear and conventional strategic environments]{.underline}.
Whereas U.S. warfighting domains---air, land, maritime, space and
cyberspace---describe military operational "space," strategic
environments comprise core features that condition states' security
behaviors. Simply stated, the core features of the nuclear environment
are segmentation, that is, a feature that manifests as territorial
boundaries, and incontestable costs (that is, there is no valid defense
against nuclear weapons), which lead to a dominant behavior of coercion
in the form of a deterrence strategy (that is, mutually assured
destruction). The conventional strategic environment also comprises
segmentation but is coupled with contestable costs (conventional
capabilities, unlike nuclear weapons, may be defended against). This
leads to dominant, episodic behaviors of brute force or coercion, where
the latter takes the form of a deterrence strategy threatening to impose
costs or a compellence strategy imposing costs through conventional war.
[Post-World War II [international law]{.mark}]{.underline}, specifically
the U.N. Charter and subsequent CIL interpretations of the charter, was
conditioned by the weight of these core features. With the objective of
saving "succeeding generations from the scourge of war," these rules of
state behavior [[are centered on sovereignty]{.mark}, [nonintervention,
coercion,]{.mark} threat or use of [force, and armed
attack]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[cyberspace]{.mark} strategic
environment [is distinct]{.mark} from the nuclear and conventional
environments, which poses a challenge to the relevance of these
rules]{.underline}. Cyber persistence theory argues that, simply stated,
the core features of the cyber strategic environment comprise
interconnectedness (not segmentation), a condition of constant contact
(not the prospect of episodic action), an abundance of organic
vulnerabilities, and macro-resilience (an ability to recover from
exploitation of those vulnerabilities). Consequently, [states face a
security imperative to persist in seizing and maintaining the initiative
to set the conditions of security in their favor in and through
cyberspace.]{.underline} States can do so through various strategies,
policies and activities that reduce the potential for exploitation of
their own vulnerabilities and exploit the vulnerabilities of
adversaries.

# Enforcement

## CIL

### 1nc Fails

#### CIL lacks a strong framework and accountability

**Joyner, 18** (Daniel H. Joyner, 10-31-2018, \"Why I Stopped Believing
in Customary International Law,\" Cambridge Core,
<https://doi.org/10.1017/S2044251318000188>, LASA-CSK)

So again, I think there is a big problem here. The problem is that the
[agencies that are]{.underline} looked to as identifiers of
[[CIL]{.underline}]{.mark}---[international courts, the ILC, and
academics]{.underline}---have been demonstrated to typically [[go
about]{.mark} that exercise [in]{.mark} methodologically [bankrupt
ways]{.mark}]{.underline}. And we don't just do it because we are lazy
or incompetent, we do it so that we can use the resulting assertions of
CIL obligations in instrumentalist ways, typically to expand
international law to apply in areas where states have not given their
explicit consent to be bound through agreed treaty text. The [asserted
[rules of CIL]{.mark}]{.underline} which the short-cut methodologies of
identification create, are therefore [[of low cred]{.mark}ibility in the
eyes of states,]{.underline} who are understandably reluctant to have
judges and academics creating new legal obligations for them. This
problem is so difficult to address because [[it is]{.mark} so
[institutionally entrenched]{.mark}]{.underline}. Courts and the ILC and
many academics have every reason to continue to support the orthodox
approach [to]{.underline} CIL identification, which [is]{.underline} so
[susceptible to this methodological mischief, because it serves their
instrumentalist purposes]{.underline}. [[The ILC's]{.mark} ongoing
[study]{.mark}]{.underline} on this topic, which will almost certainly
provide yet another reaffirmation of the orthodox approach, [[will only
further]{.mark} [institutionalize the problem]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Again, my problem is not with CIL itself as a source of law. In a
theoretical sense, I have no problem with the idea that states can
collectively make law that governs their interactions with each other,
through an evolving process that is not necessarily written down in one
law-making moment. Particularly under the modern approach that places
emphasis and priority upon opinio juris, [states can manifest their
recognition of an obligation, and their consent to be bound thereby,
through their subjective statements of legal understanding.]{.underline}
The problem is that [[we]{.mark} simply [do not]{.mark} currently [have
a]{.mark} structural [framework within the]{.mark} [international legal
system that can support this method]{.mark} of law creation in a manner
[that]{.mark} [satisfies]{.mark} concerns about [objectivity and]{.mark}
empirical [verifiability]{.mark}]{.underline} of that positivistic
manifestation of affirmation and consent. And without this institutional
structure, the black magic that stands in for identification of CIL in
practice undermines the credibility of every assertion of CIL.
[[It]{.underline}]{.mark} also, by extension, [[undermines the
cred]{.mark}ibility [of the international]{.mark} legal [system
itself]{.mark}.]{.underline}

## Norms

#### No internal link to international norms.

**Hirsh '5-11** --- Michael; senior correspondent at Foreign Policy. May
11, 2022; \"Why Biden's Anti-Putin Democracy Crusade Is Failing\";
*Foreign Policy*;
https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/05/11/us-russia-war-ukraine-democracy-autocracy/;
//CYang

In the beginning, Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of
[[Ukraine appeared]{.mark} to be]{.underline} an [[ideal]{.mark}
rationale [for]{.mark}]{.underline} U.S. President Joe [Biden's
**[global]{.mark} democracy** [campaign]{.mark}]{.underline}. What
better endorsement could there be than the spectacle of a brave, doughty
democracy fighting off a brutal autocrat? As Biden put it in a major
speech in Poland in March, Ukraine was now "on the front lines" in "the
perennial struggle for democracy and freedom." But despite Ukraine's
success on the ground against Putin's military, the [White House's
[efforts]{.mark}]{.underline} in the months since [[to]{.mark}
[frame]{.mark} the [conflict as]{.mark}]{.underline} a [**titanic
worldwide [battle]{.mark}** [between democracy and autocracy
don't]{.mark} appear to be [work]{.mark}ing]{.underline} very well.
[Outside of Western European]{.underline} allies and longtime U.S.
partners such as Japan, much of [the rest of [the world]{.mark} **simply
[isn't signing on]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Problem one: Most of these
countries either aren't democracies or are so deeply flawed as
democracies that they're less than inspired by the rhetoric.
[[Problem]{.underline}]{.mark} two: [[In the eyes
of]{.underline}]{.mark} much of [[the world]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[the]{.mark} country that's doing the [preaching]{.mark}]{.underline}
--- [[the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} ---
[[is]{.mark} a **[badly broken]{.mark} democracy**]{.underline} that
ought to heal itself first. These [problems were
**evident**]{.underline} at the White House [this week]{.underline},
when Biden welcomed leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (**[[ASEAN]{.underline}]{.mark}**), most of whom are autocrats
or represent one-party states that show no signs of going democratic.
Among them: Cambodia's longtime strongman Hun Sen; Thai Prime Minister
Pravuth Chan-ocha, a former general who seized power in a 2014 coup; and
the authoritarian leaders of Vietnam, Laos, and Brunei. To Biden's
relief, the head of Myanmar's junta, Min Aung Hlaing, another ASEAN
member, was not among them. On Wednesday, Kurt Campbell, Biden's lead
White House advisor on East Asia, acknowledged that the talks would be
"maybe a little bit uncomfortable at times" but did not directly address
the issue of flagging democracy in the region. "I do think we will have
a full exchange and we acknowledge that there are differences of view,"
he said at a forum at the United States Institute of Peace. Most of
these countries have [indicated they are **[nonaligned]{.mark}**
in]{.underline} the [struggle between Russia and the West]{.underline};
Indonesia, another leading ASEAN member and a democracy, has even
invited Putin to the G-20 summit it is hosting in November. The ASEAN
countries are [[joined by]{.mark} nations across the Middle
East]{.underline}, [South Asia]{.underline}, [[Latin
America]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and Africa]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
countries that include a number of democracies but also a quasi-rogue
gallery of autocrats and dubious democrats who represent the majority of
the world's population. And they are not persuaded that Russia, a major
source of oil and gas supplies, needs to be cut off from the global
system. "Their attitude is, '[[**Who are you** to]{.mark} be
[tell]{.mark}ing [us what to do]{.mark}]{.underline} or telling us what
our rights are? [People in your country who win the popular vote don't
even get elected president]{.underline}. So [don't preach to
us]{.underline}!'" said Michael Coppedge, an expert in democratization
at the University of Notre Dame who is one of the managers of an
exhaustive international study by the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem)
Institute, released last month. According to a report by Freedom House,
"Reversing the Decline of Democracy in the United States,"
"\[[A]{.underline}\][mid]{.underline} a [**16-year decline** in global
freedom]{.underline}, [democracy]{.underline} in the United States has
[suffered **serious erosion**]{.underline}." The report found that the
United States had [dropped to level of **flawed
democracies**]{.underline} like [Panama]{.underline},
[Romania]{.underline}, [and South Korea]{.underline} and concluded, "The
[weakening of American democracy did not start with]{.underline}
\[former U.S.\] President \[Donald\] [Trump's]{.underline} direct
pressure on democratic institutions and rights, [and his
departure]{.underline} from the White House [has not ended]{.underline}
the crisis." Critics say that while the Biden administration's framing
of the conflict is working well within NATO and the West --- joined by
firm U.S. allies such as Japan and South Korea --- the U.S. president
needs to rethink his approach if he wants to corral more allies in his
efforts to isolate and weaken Russia. The real issue being tested, they
say, is not democracy per se but rather an issue that most countries can
identify with more readily: the sanctity of their borders under
post-World War II norms upheld by United Nations-sanctioned
international law. "This is about territorial integrity and non-use of
force to change borders, along with international norms. Those are the
core issues," said Bruce Jentleson, a political scientist at Duke
University and a former senior foreign-policy advisor to former U.S.
Vice President Al Gore and the State Department's Policy Planning Staff.
"In that respect, it's akin to Kuwait 1990," when then-U.S. President
George H.W. Bush won a broad international consensus against then-Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein. In an email, Jentleson added that while he has
"great admiration" for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's wartime
leadership, Ukraine itself has long been known to be a "questionable
democracy" and one of the world's most corrupt countries. Chas Freeman
Jr., a former senior U.S. diplomat who helped to frame George H.W.
Bush's "new world order" concept during the 1990-1991 Persian Gulf
crisis, agreed with this assessment. And [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}
has indeed [[condemned]{.underline}]{.mark} Russia's [invasion
[as]{.mark}]{.underline} ​"[a **flagrant [violation]{.mark}** [of
i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark}]{.underline}."
[[But]{.underline}]{.mark} Freeman said [the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates would have to work hard to restore its
credibility]{.underline} on that front [in the wake of its own **more
recent [violations]{.mark}** of international norms]{.underline},
[including]{.underline} the use of [[torture]{.mark} and]{.underline}
the invasion of [[Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark}. "We need to return to the
[basic principles of international law]{.underline} that we [**foolishly
[set]{.mark}** [aside]{.mark}]{.underline}, but that's going to be a
problem," Freeman told Foreign Policy. "The United States sponsored,
created, and enforced what is now called the liberal international order
after World War II. So you have the U.N. Charter, which lays out the
basic principles of international law. You can't go to war without a
justification from the U.N. Security Council, which we had \[in
1990-91\]. But that was the last time we observed those norms. After
that, [[every principle of i]{.mark}nternational
[law]{.mark}]{.underline} that [we pioneered]{.underline}, [we
violated]{.underline}." Returning to those basic principles, with
appropriate mea culpas, may be the only course forward if the United
States is to win over much of the world, Freeman said. What won't work,
he added, is evangelizing about the glories of democracy --- an old
American habit, and one that he believes the Biden team is resorting to
for largely domestic political benefit. "I've thought from the beginning
that frankly [[this is a **load of crap**]{.underline}]{.mark}," Freeman
said. "It's a [**very [American]{.mark}** [conceit]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[And]{.underline} it's particularly ironic that it should [come to the
fore during a period]{.underline} when [our own democracy is manifestly
in **deep trouble** and we're not]{.underline} even [sure we're going to
have a peaceful transition in 2024]{.underline}." Biden's credibility
problem extends to other major nations that have not gone along with
Biden's campaign --- and which continue to temporize over the Russian
invasion. For India, the issue has little to do with democracy and
everything to do with border security, said Rani Mullen, a scholar at
the College of William & Mary. Its increasingly autocratic leader, Prime
Minister Narendra Modi, is a populist fanning sectarian hatred between
Hindus and Muslims while on the international stage, he pursues
relations with both Moscow and Washington. Since the beginning of the
year, India has dramatically stepped up its purchases of discounted
Russian oil --- which Modi desperately needs to shore up India's
weakening economy. Modi's stance is entirely about realpolitik, said
Mullen, an expert in South and Central Asia. And that means maintaining
workable relations with Russia so as not to encourage a deeper
partnership between Moscow and China, the Indians' most feared potential
aggressor along with Pakistan, which has a cozy relationship with
Beijing. For New Delhi, the most paramount issue is border integrity
under the 1954 Panchsheel Agreement (which the Chinese call the "Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence") between India and China.
"Ultimately, India's stance is driven by thinking that alienating Russia
will undermine its security," Mullen said. "Democracy? What does it
care? That's the reality of it. It's all about China. So framing Russian
actions in a way that would guarantee mutual respect for each other's
territorial integrity --- that would strike a different chord." More
broadly, the stark fact Biden must confront is that democracy has been
in retreat since the Cold War. "The level of democracy enjoyed by the
average global citizen in 2021 is down to 1989 levels. The last 30 years
of democratic advances are now eradicated," a report by the V-Dem
Institute said. "Dictatorships are on the rise and harbor 70% of the
world population---5.4 billion people." The study found that liberal
democracies can now be found in only 34 nations, down from its peak of
42 in 2012, which are home to only 13 percent of the world's population.
A key fence-sitter in this global struggle over international norms is
authoritarian China, which has sought to find a middle ground between
Russia and the West. Chinese President Xi Jinping is sticking by his
partnership with Putin, yet Beijing has mostly observed economic
sanctions against Russia. Chinese officials say their country is loath
to choose sides, but Washington has made that difficult by portraying
the conflict as one that is primarily about Western-style democracy
rather than global norms. As Robert Manning, a former U.S. intelligence
official and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, wrote in Foreign
Policy this week: "The logic of 'democracies only' could lead to a
bifurcated or maybe trifurcated world." China covets Taiwan much as
Russia does Ukraine, but even Washington still officially embraces its
long-time "one China" policy, acknowledging that Taiwan is part of a
single China. Beijing is angry that this diplomatic mainstay is also
fraying, with Biden's State Department removing such language from its
official guidance website, which no longer states that Washington "does
not support Taiwan independence." Nor has the Biden administration
offered up any new initiatives to wean Beijing away from Moscow. Other
major nations, even those that are democratic, also are making
calculations based on factors that have little to do with the threat to
democracy. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro recently said he would
continue to support Russia's participation at international forums, such
as the G-20, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. Some
experts say the [[inconsistencies]{.mark} in Biden's approach to
democracy]{.underline} have [[hurt]{.mark} him as well]{.underline}. The
president's virtual [[democracy summit]{.underline}]{.mark} at the end
of last year was widely [criticized for]{.underline} the seemingly
[[arbitrary]{.mark} way some countries]{.underline} were invited while
others were [snubbed]{.underline}. The Philippines' anti-U.S. president,
Rodrigo [[Duterte]{.underline}]{.mark}, was
[[welcomed]{.underline}]{.mark} for example [despite]{.underline} his
[**violent campaign** of extrajudicial executions]{.underline}, whereas
Washington-aligned [[Singapore]{.underline}]{.mark}, which was
[[rated]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[partly free]{.underline}]{.mark}" in
Freedom House's annual study of rights and liberties worldwide, was
excluded. Singapore's Freedom House [ranking was also [higher
than]{.mark}]{.underline} some other invitees, such as
**[[Angola]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the
[**[D]{.mark}**emocratic **[R]{.mark}**epublic of
**[C]{.mark}**ongo]{.underline}, **[[Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}**,

"Countries that are not democratic are being treated as democratic.

who ought to have been most interested in preserving it. Role of
Rhetoric in the Russian aggression [International law]{.underline} has
been [referenced by Russia in [justify]{.mark}ing]{.underline} its
invasion of [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russia has [advanced **every
possible [exception]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the [prohibition
of]{.underline} the [use of force]{.underline} in different disguises
[including [invitation]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[self-defence]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.mark} **humanitarian
[intervention]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Sayapin's summary here). The
weakness of the legal claims are reflected in the general rejection they
have deservedly received.\[1\] Still, the Russian attempt to provide
legal grounds to its actions is remarkable, going as far as recognising
two new 'states' for the purpose of presenting the invasion as a
consent-based 'peace operation'.\[2\] Russia also declared that
sanctions used against its economy as countermeasures are akin go an act
of war, reviving legal arguments that equate use of armed force to
coercive means of enforcing international law. \[3\] The swift
engagement and prompt response of the European Court of Human Rights,
the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court
is remarkable and a revealing testimony of the centrality of
international law in the means used to address the conflict. \[4\]
**[Beyond repair]{.underline}** -- (another) wake up call to replace the
system The [**[U]{.mark}**nited **[N]{.mark}**ations]{.underline} was
established in 1945 with the primary objective of protecting future
generations from the scourge of war. This mission [relied
on]{.underline} two pillars: stopping the use of armed force, and
creating a [**[S]{.mark}**ecurity **[C]{.mark}**ouncil with]{.underline}
unique [responsibility for maintaining global peace and
security]{.underline}. [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} (then the Soviet
Union), [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [United Kingdom]{.underline},
[France and the United States]{.underline} have since [occupied a
**privileged position**]{.underline} with [**[permanent]{.mark} seats**
and [veto powers]{.mark}]{.underline}. In practice this means that
outside the confines of self-defence, the use of armed force is only
legal if the States most likely to provoke a third world war are in
agreement. In other words, the [system]{.underline} is [based on
granting **extraordinary powers** to a few countries]{.underline} that
would, in exchange, act as guardians of international peace and
security. What is often referred to as '~~paralysis~~'
\[**[[inaction]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] has been [[the
**cornerstone**]{.mark} of a system designed to prevent]{.underline} a
[third world war]{.underline}. As I have explained elsewhere (here and
here), the [[legitimacy]{.underline}]{.mark} of the Security Council has
been [[**irreversibly undermined** by]{.underline}]{.mark} previous
[illegal uses of force in [Kosovo]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[Syria]{.mark}
and [Iraq]{.mark}]{.underline} by other permanent members of the
Security Council (mainly the USA and the UK, but also France). States'
attempts to address the Russia/Ukraine conflict through dispute
settlement mechanisms, with an emphasis on legal arguments manifested in
an exceptionally prolific use of international courts, consolidates the
strength of legal rules involved in this scenario. However,
[[**unanimous condemnations** of Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} contained
in emerging decisions derived from applying standard frameworks are
[[unlikely to stop the war]{.underline}]{.mark}. This conflict will
likely end at a negotiation table, potentially with a peace agreement,
hopefully in the short-term, to prevent further suffering, loss of life
and weapons induced accelerated planetary destruction. The strength of
the rule prohibiting the use of force is likely to rise and States that
have progressively broadened the scope of exceptions to legitimise their
lethal enterprises may reconsider their positions. This is not the case
for the system established to monitor and guarantee compliance with the
rules through the United Nations Security Council. The [destruction of
the pillars on which]{.underline} the [**collective security system**
was built]{.underline} in 1945 has been [completed by those who
benefited]{.underline} most [from it]{.underline} and who were in charge
of preserving its worth as an effective mechanism to prevent a global
armed conflict and total annihilation. End of the Security Council
Whatever the outcome, it is hardly conceivable that the weakened
legitimacy of the Security Council can survive this final blow in
neither its current nor reformed form. Those in power will seek to in
articulate and enforce rules maintaining the status quo of their
privileged position. Because it requires legitimacy to be acceptable to
the majority away from power, law also embeds some form of public
morality and fairness. We are at a crossroad: while the prominence of
the [**[i]{.mark}**nternational **[l]{.mark}**egal
**[o]{.mark}**rder]{.underline} in times of crisis has been evident, [it
is [**not possible** to save]{.mark} the system]{.underline} designed to
prevent and/or stop a global war only [by rewriting it]{.underline} (as
suggested by Johns and Kotova). Paraphrasing Castellino, [the logic
leading to]{.underline} the [obliteration of this system]{.underline}
has [highlighted how outdated its premises are]{.underline}. This
underscores the imperative urgent need for a radically new approach to
international relations, perhaps beyond the political organisation of
the state and the conception of a 'nation' underpinning it.

## ILAW/Treaties

### 1nc No Enforcement

#### Lack of enforcement mechanisms means no compliance

That Matter?"; *United States News*;

[[Under **no scenario** is]{.mark} Russia's]{.underline} armed [invasion
of [Ukraine legal under]{.mark}]{.underline} contemporary
[**[i]{.mark}**nternational [**law** and norms]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Self-defense is the only justification for use of force against another
country, according to international law. This condition is found in the
[U.N. Charter](https://legal.un.org/repertory/art51.shtml) and is
binding for all 193 U.N. member countries. The charter's only clear
exception to prohibiting the use of force is self-defense, "if an armed
attack occurs" against a country. Rescuing citizens who are trapped or
in danger in another country is recognized as a form of self-defense.
But these interventions are strictly limited to evacuating citizens, not
overthrowing governments. Nothing that Ukraine has done to date could be
construed as an "armed attack" on Russia and justify any Russian claim
to self-defense. Even if Putin's false claim that Ukraine is targeting
Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine were true, it would not justify the
countrywide attacks he has unleashed. Intervening for [humanitarian
reasons](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1940550),
such as trying to prevent large-scale loss of life or suffering, has
been asserted by a few countries and activists as another rationale for
use of force. But this justification has not yet been widely accepted,
unless the U.N. Security Council authorizes the intervention. It did so
when it authorized a U.S.-led military force in [Somalia in
1992](http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/794) to help prevent famine. How
is international law enforced? "Almost all nations observe almost all
principles of international law ... almost all of the time," a highly
respected U.S. law professor, Louis Henkin, [wrote in
1979.](https://web.law.columbia.edu/louis-henkin/quotable-louis-henkin)
[[There is **no**]{.mark} **standing international police
[force]{.mark}** [to enforce **i**]{.mark}nternational
[law]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Compliance is]{.underline}]{.mark}
primarily [in the [hands of countries themselves]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The [**[I]{.mark}**nternational **[C]{.mark}**ourt of
**[J]{.mark}**ustice]{.underline}, created by the U.N. and located in
the Hague, Netherlands, decides disputes between countries, including
alleged violations of the U.N. Charter. But [[only 73
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} out 195 [have
[accepted]{.mark}]{.underline} the [court's
[jurisdiction]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**.[**[N]{.underline}**.
**[S]{.underline}**]{.mark}[ecurity **[C]{.mark}**ouncil]{.underline}
also has the authority to authorize the use of force under the U.N.
Charter in order to maintain international peace and security. This
[option is **[unrealistic]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the situation of
Ukraine because [[Russia]{.mark} has a **permanent seat** on the
council]{.underline} --- [along with]{.underline} the other four
permanent members: the
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}.[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}.,
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}.[[K]{.underline}]{.mark}., [[France]{.mark} and
[China]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [and]{.underline} thus [[holds
**veto**]{.mark} **power** over any decision]{.underline}. Finally,
either the U.N. Security Council or individual [countries may
impose]{.underline} economic or diplomatic
[[sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} if necessary, [as the U.S. and European
countries](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/politics/joe-biden-ukraine-russia-sanctions/index.html)
have done. [But]{.underline} such [actions can have [only]{.mark} an
**[indirect impact]{.mark}**]{.underline} on deterring or ending a war.
[[There is]{.underline}]{.mark} probably [[no law]{.underline}]{.mark},
[international]{.underline} or domestic, [[that enjoys]{.mark}
**universal [compliance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [challenge to
enforce **[i]{.mark}**nternational [law]{.mark} remains]{.underline} ---
a [**challenge [laid bare]{.mark}** most [**recently** and **blatantly**
by]{.mark} Russia's [invasion]{.mark} of Ukraine]{.underline}.

### 1nc No US Cred

#### Treaties fail -- strong states don't face penalties, resort to power dynamics instead of legal obligations, and ICJ jurisdiction is almost nonexistent

**Simone, 1/7** (Brooke Simone, J.D. Candidate, University of Michigan
Law School, 1-7-2022, \"Strong States' Noncompliance, Absence, and
Self-Interest: How Effective Are Treaties Really? --- The Michigan
Journal of International Law,\" Michigan Journal of International Law,
<http://www.mjilonline.org/strong-states-noncompliance-absence-and-self-interest-how-effective-are-treaties-really/>,
LASA-CSK)

First, while [the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties
(VCLT)]{.underline} Article 60 [allows for termination or suspension of
a treaty in the event of material breach]{.underline},\[3\] the
likelihood of that termination occurring is minimal, especially for
certain types of treaties. [[For human]{.mark} [rights, nuclear
non-prolif]{.mark}eration, [or environmental treaties, termination
would]{.mark} [undermine]{.mark} the [global stability]{.mark} and
norms]{.underline} that the parties entered into the treaty to
protect.\[4\] States' commitment to the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights, a key human rights treaty, has not wavered despite
numerous breaches, even as recent as June 2020 after a United Nations'
report outlined the Philippines' grave human rights violations.\[5\]
Second, **[[strong states are less likely to face]{.mark} retaliation or
[penalties]{.mark}]{.underline}** as a result of treaty violation. For
these states, [[breach does not]{.mark} typically [threaten]{.mark}
reputational [damage severe enough]{.mark} [to encourage compliance, nor
do they fear]{.mark} reciprocal [sanctions, political
pressure]{.mark}]{.underline}, or other retorsions and countermeasures
as much because of their position as economic and political
powerhouses.\[6\] [[Strong states]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[act out
of self-preservation]{.mark} and self-aggrandizement, [reacting to power
dynamics instead of legal obligations]{.mark} or fear of
penalty]{.underline}\[7\]: according to realist Charles Krauthammer,
[treaties are meaningless "when dealing with countries for which law of
any kind is a mere instrument]{.underline}, infinitely adaptable to the
requirements of power."\[8\] Other enforcement mechanisms, such as
internal domestic pressure and shaming by NGOs, are not unique to
treaties and are just as influential for breaches of customary
international law (CIL) or unilateral statements.\[9\] Third, **[the
idea that [treaty breach]{.mark} can [trigger legal actions]{.mark} in
court against the violator [is]{.mark} actually [limited]{.mark} in
practice]{.underline}**, as [there is not always guarantee of
jurisdiction]{.underline}. [States face binding legal repercussions
before the]{.underline} International Court of Justice
([ICJ]{.underline}) [under three situations of contentious jurisdiction,
which are often avoided by states]{.underline}.\[10\] [The [ICJ has
jurisdiction]{.mark} [over]{.mark}]{.underline} leading international
[[actors]{.underline}]{.mark} like the U.S., Russia, and China [[only if
they signed a prior]{.mark} [treaty agreeing to refer disputes
to]{.mark} the [court]{.mark}]{.underline};\[11\] [[the U.]{.mark}S. has
further limited this legal accountability]{.underline}. [It
[announced]{.mark}]{.underline} in October 2018 that [[it would withdraw
from the O]{.mark}ptional [P]{.mark}rotocol and [D]{.mark}ispute
[R]{.mark}esolution]{.underline} to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic
Relations, [[which]{.mark} [granted ICJ
jurisdiction]{.mark}.\[]{.underline}12\] Ambassador Bolton justified
this by referring to President Reagan's withdrawal from the Optional
Compulsory Jurisdiction of the ICJ under Article 36(2) of the ICJ
statute and President Bush's withdrawal from the Optional Protocol to
the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, two additional ways the
U.S. has lessened its ability to be held liable.\[13\] Even when the ICJ
or other third-party mechanisms are available options, states can be
reluctant to take their disputes there.\[14\] For these reasons, [[lack
of definite review]{.mark} before a court [minimizes]{.mark} the [threat
of being held accountable]{.mark} for breach,]{.underline} thereby
[negating much of a treaty's meaningfulness in promoting credible
commitment and compliance]{.underline}. While multilateral treaties
strive to create uniform, widespread agreement and enforceability,
perhaps it is instead CIL -- which emerges over time as binding upon all
states without having to opt-in to legal review -- that accomplishes
that goal, enabling potential accountability for any state's violation
of the law. In addition to the lack of repercussions for treaty
noncompliance, a look at the **[U.[S.'s absence and withdrawal
from]{.mark} various multilateral [agreements suggests that
treaties]{.mark} may [not]{.mark} be as significant or
[effective]{.mark} as frequently argued]{.underline}**. [[The U.S. has
not signed or ratified several key international treaties]{.mark};\[15\]
it is not party to the VCLT or the United Nations Convention on the Law
of the Sea,]{.underline} but generally accepts their guidelines as
binding under CIL.\[16\] This begs the question: Is codification via
treaty necessary for adherence and enforcement, or can CIL be enough?
Additionally, the Trump administration has recently withdrawn from
numerous treaties.\[17\] In May 2020, the U.S. announced its intentions
to withdraw from the 1992 Open Skies Treaty (OST),\[18\] which was
formed after the Cold War to promote trust between the U.S. and Russia
and allows parties to conduct unarmed surveillance flights in each
other's air space.\[19\] The very premise of this treaty has eroded. The
U.S. accused Russia of treaty breach and is now pulling out, despite
other countries expressing both continued commitment to the
agreement\[20\] and worry regarding U.S. withdrawal.\[21\] So another
question arises: How effective is a treaty like the OST in its objective
to create a binding foundation for trust if irrational leaders can
undermine just that, seemingly without concern for the other parties or
for global stability? Treaties' efficacy is also called into question by
the U.S.'s wielding of economic power to ~~cripple~~ still-intact
treaties. In 2018, the [U.S. [withdrew from the]{.mark}]{.underline}
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) -- better known as the
[[Iran]{.mark} nuclear [deal]{.mark}]{.underline} -- which allowed for
the easing of economic sanctions in exchange for Iran restricting its
nuclear program.\[22\] Believers in treaties' infallible strength would
likely have envisioned that the other P5+1 members could continue
adhering to the JCPOA's conditions, at least to a degree. However, [the
U.S. imposed secondary sanctions on any government that traded with
Iran]{.underline}, [using its "domination of financial markets" to
"bull\[y\] other countries into capitulating."\[]{.underline}23\]
Another question yet: [Can treaties be touted as binding and successful
mechanisms if one powerful, renegade state can threaten the entire
agreement through economic force]{.underline}?

### 2nc Fail No US Cred

#### Can't solve US treaty cred -- that wrecks ILAW efficacy broadly

**Wahal, 21** (Anya Wahal, 9-21-2021, \"On International Treaties, the
United States Refuses to Play Ball,\" Council on Foreign Relations,
<https://www.cfr.org/blog/international-treaties-united-states-refuses-play-ball>,
LASA-CSK)

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [enters]{.mark} into more than
[two-hundred treaties each year]{.mark} on]{.underline} a range of
international issues, including [peace, defense, human rights, and the
environment]{.underline}. Despite this seemingly impressive figure,
**[the United States [constantly fails to sign or ratify]{.mark}
treaties]{.underline}** the rest of the world supports. It has failed to
ratify treaties that tackle biodiversity and greenhouse gas emissions,
protect the rights of children and women, and govern international
waters. For a country frequently looked to as a global leader, [the
United States has consistently failed to step up in international
partnerships]{.underline}. In fact, [the United States has one of the
worst records]{.underline} of any country [in ratifying human rights and
environmental treaties]{.underline}. Why hasn't [the]{.mark} United
States stepped up to the plate? According to scholars and policymakers,
[one major [reason is]{.mark} the [fear of]{.mark} treaties [infringing
on national sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United States shuns
treaties that appear to subordinate its governing authority to that of
an international body like the United Nations. **[[The U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates consistently [prioritizes]{.mark} its perceived
[national interests over international
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [opting]{.underline}]{.mark} [not
to ratify **[to]{.mark}** **[protect the]{.mark} rights of** U.S.
businesses or safeguard **the [government's freedom to act on national
security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Politics]{.mark} also [poses
a]{.mark} significant [barrier]{.mark} to ratification]{.underline}.
While presidents can sign [treaties, [ratification requires]{.mark} the
approval of [two-thirds of the Senate]{.mark}]{.underline}. Oftentimes,
the power of special interest groups and the desire of politicians to
maintain party power, on top of existing concerns of sovereignty, almost
assures U.S. opposition to treaty ratification. [[The]{.mark} [failure
of the]{.mark} United [S]{.mark}tates to [lead on international treaty
accession]{.mark} can have dangerous consequences]{.underline}. It can
[[undermine the]{.mark} [credi]{.mark}bility [of those treaties, weaken
international partnerships]{.mark},]{.underline} and raise concerns
about the United States' own commitments to matters such as human rights
and environmental protection. By refusing to ratify treaties the rest of
the world supports, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [can
lose]{.mark} other countries' [trust and give]{.mark}s [up]{.mark} the
[influence]{.mark} of shaping the future direction of global
rules]{.underline}. Furthermore, [abstaining serves]{.underline} as a
barrier to resolving critical global and regional issues, [implicitly
giving permission to other countries to free ride and follow the rule of
law established by treaties only when it is in their best
interest]{.underline}. Given these implications, I outline ten treaties
the United States has not ratified and highlight arguments opponents
cite for the lack of ratification. Many international law scholars
purport that treaties are the most effective and binding source of
international law.\[1\] However, the [[efficacy of multilateral
treaties]{.underline}]{.mark} may be [[exaggerated]{.mark},
as]{.underline} [demonstrated by [minimal penalties for
noncompliance]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly for strong states,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [the United States']{.underline} absence from
and [self-[interested interpretation]{.mark} of]{.underline} various
[treaties]{.underline}. The promotion of credible commitment is held as
an essential benefit of treaties; proponents argue that treaties raise
the cost of noncompliance more effectively than informal methods and are
unique in showing the seriousness of a party to a commitment.\[2\] These
contentions lose some force after investigating three enforcement
mechanisms for treaty breaches, and the lack of negative impacts
thereof.

#### The US is an [unreliable international partner]{.underline} --- we'll insert this list.

//CYang

Well, the [[US is]{.mark} an **[unreliable]{.mark} international
partner**]{.underline} --- [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} it [[has long been
one]{.underline}]{.mark}, [even before the]{.underline} current
administration pulled out from the Trans-Pacific Partnership
([TPP]{.underline}) and the [Paris]{.underline} agreement on climate
change, [and **threatened to end NAFTA**]{.underline}.
[[History]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[dotted with
treaties]{.underline}]{.mark} that [the [US]{.mark}]{.underline} has
[signed but not ratified]{.underline}, [[signed]{.underline}]{.mark} and
[[then unsigned]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} even
[[refused]{.mark} to sign]{.underline} after pushing everyone else to
sign.

[[Capriciousness]{.underline}]{.mark} about international treaties [is
[a]{.mark}n **old US [tradition]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It [starts
with]{.underline} the country's very creation: hundreds of [treaties
signed with Native American tribes]{.underline} that were either broken,
or not ratified. Today, the [[US]{.mark} is]{.underline} one of [the
countries to have [ratified the **fewest**]{.mark} **number** of
**international human rights [treaties]{.mark}**]{.underline} ---
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[18]{.mark} agreements passed by the
UN]{.underline}, [[America]{.mark} has [only ratified
**five**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Treaties between the US and American Indian Nations]{.underline}
([1722-1869]{.underline})

According to the US national archives, 374 treaties (pdf, p.4) signed
between the US and Native American Tribes from 1772 to 1867 were
ratified. Of these, many were not respected: Only one article of the
Pickering Treaty, or Treaty of Canadaigua of 1794, for instance, has
been observed. Many others (18 in California alone, signed during the
Gold Rush) were not even ratified. These include Treaty K, or the
California Treaty, which promised reservations to American Indians
within the state.

[Treaty of Versailles]{.underline}, [1919]{.underline}

President Woodrow Wilson was a promoter and negotiator of the treaty
that ended World War I. The agreement was signed between the Allied
Powers and Germany; commenting on the US's role in brokering the deal,
Wilson famously said, "At last the world knows America as the savior of
the world!"

However, the president encountered strong and growing opposition to the
treaty in Congress, and the US never ratified the Treaty of Versailles.
In fact, the US didn't formally end its war against Germany and the
former Austro-Hungarian empire until 1921.

[International Labor Convention]{.underline}, [1949]{.underline}

The oldest treaty currently pending ratification in the Senate is an
international recognition of the freedom of association and protection
of the right to organize. The agreement was signed by 154 countries,
including the US, and entered in full effect in 1950. However, the US
never ratified it (pdf).

[Geneva Agreement]{.underline}, [1954]{.underline}

The Conference of Geneva in 1954 was called to put a final end to the
Korean War and First Indochina War. The treaty was signed by Vietnam,
France, China, the USSR, and the UK. Although the US participated in the
conference and negotiations, it eventually refused to sign. However, it
did agree to respect the ceasefire.

[International Covenant on Economic]{.underline}, [Social]{.underline},
[and Cultural Rights]{.underline} ([ICESCR]{.underline}),
[1966]{.underline}

Building onto the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ICESCR
expands the notion of basic rights beyond civil and political
provisions. The agreement has been ratified by 166 countries. The US has
signed, but has not ratified, the covenant.

[The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discriminations
Against Women]{.underline} ([CEDAW]{.underline}), [1979]{.underline}

By signing CEDAW in 1980, the US become one of 156 signatories of a
landmark agreement to end gender discrimination. Shortly after signing,
then-president Jimmy Carter submitted the agreement for ratification to
the Senate. It's still waiting.

[The Law of the Sea]{.underline}, [1982]{.underline}

The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) was held in Jamaica
between 1973 and 1982. It established a set of rules and
responsibilities governing the way countries and international bodies
act in international waters. For instance, UNCLOS details the
requirements of search and rescue at sea. In 1994, the US signed the
agreement. However, it did not ratify it.

[Convention on the Rights of the Child]{.underline} ([CRC]{.underline}),
[1989]{.underline}

The CRC is a landmark human rights document for several reasons. It's
the first defining agreement on the rights of children, and it
incorporate a wide range of rights (education, health, justice) for
minors. It achieved broad support very quickly, with near-unanimous
ratification across the globe.

The US signed the agreement in 1995. It is the only country that has not
ratified it.

[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]{.underline}, [1996]{.underline}

Although the treaty banning nuclear testing was adopted by the UN
Assembly General in 1996, and has been ratified by 166 countries, the
agreement is not yet into effect due to eight key countries who have not
yet ratified it. The US, which signed in 1996, is one of them---the
others are China, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, North Korea, and Pakistan.

[Mine-Ban Treaty]{.underline}, [or Ottawa Treaty]{.underline},
[1997]{.underline}

The mine ban's goal is to eliminate anti-person mines, prohibiting their
production, stockpiling, or use. The US is one of 33 states (including
Russia, India, and China) that have signed but not ratified the treaty.

[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]{.underline},
[1998]{.underline}

The Rome treaty establishing an international criminal court was
negotiated by 148 countries. Of them, 120 approved of the final draft in
1998 (pdf), seven opposed it, and 21 abstained from voting.

Bill Clinton signed the agreement in 2000 but delayed submitting it to
the Senate for ratification, on the grounds that the US needed to
observe how the tribunal worked. Two years later, after the treaty had
come into full effect and been ratified by 60 countries, George W Bush
informed the United Nations that the US no longer intended to submit the
agreement to the Senate for ratification at all.

[Kyoto Protocol]{.underline}, [1997]{.underline}

Though the US signed the agreement limiting carbon emissions, it never
intended to ratify it. The US is one of just four UN member states that
have not enforced the agreement, with Andorra, Canada, and South Sudan.

[Paris Climate Accord]{.underline}, [2015]{.underline}

The Paris deal to mitigate climate change by reducing emissions was
signed by 195 member states in 2015, and became effective the following
year. President Trump withdrew from the agreement on June 1, 2017.
However, the US is still bound to follow the Paris deal's requirements
until 2020.

Several more international treaties are pending ratification from the US
Senate, for a total of 45 between 1949 and 2017. The US is also notably
absent from signing prominent international treaties including the Mine
Ban Treaty, the Convention Against Torture, and on the Rights of Persons
with Disabilities.

only]{.mark} about [forty per cent]{.mark}]{.underline} of the time.
[[Years]{.mark} of sanctions [failed]{.mark} [in No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea]{.underline}, [[Venezuela]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
[[Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Cuba]{.underline}]{.mark} has faced
layers of U.S. trade and arms embargoes since 1960. The Communist regime
is still in power. The [[Syria]{.mark}n]{.underline} President, Bashar
al-Assad, [faced multiple sanctions]{.underline} for his brutal
repression after the Arab Spring uprising, in 2011, turned into a civil
war. Hundreds of thousands have died, [yet Assad is still **firmly
entrenched**]{.underline} in Damascus. [Sanctions are **often
[sagas]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Success]{.mark} in South Africa
[took]{.mark}]{.underline} three [[decades]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
Iran model, which the U.S. has invoked for Russia, has had gyrating
effects. Sanctions also produce heartbreak. The agony is the
differential in timing. A gun, shell, or bomb can kill in seconds.
[Sanctions take [a]{.mark} **comparative [eon]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
the scheme of war or a humanitarian crisis. "They [rarely
work]{.underline}," Benn Steil, of the Council on Foreign Relations,
told me. "[But]{.underline}, [when they do work]{.underline},
[they]{.underline} tend to [take a **very long time**]{.underline}."

The main flaws are usually the [[exemptions]{.underline}]{.mark}, known
as carve-outs, that [[provide]{.mark} **financial
[lifelines]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Humanitarian goods]{.underline} ---
food, medical equipment, education materials --- [are generally
exempt]{.underline}. But [[enforcement]{.mark} of sanctions]{.underline}
on everything else is [[up to]{.mark} **individual
[nations]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [which]{.underline}]{.mark} can
[**amend or [bend]{.mark}** [the rules]{.mark}]{.underline} for their
own economic needs. In 1966, the U.N. for the first time issued
sanctions that sought regime change after
[[Rhodesia]{.underline}]{.mark}, now Zimbabwe, declared independence
from Britain to preserve white-minority rule. The Security Council
imposed an economic embargo on Rhodesia, but only on ninety per cent of
the country's exports. For years, the U.S. Congress approved an
additional carve-out that allowed the import of Rhodesian chromium, a
key component in American jet engines, cars, and stainless steel.
(Rhodesia was then one of three major world suppliers; the Soviet Union
was another.) It [took more than a decade]{.underline} --- of civil war
and sanctions --- for the Rhodesian regime to cede power to a
democratically elected government. Along the way, some twenty thousand
died.

Russia benefits from a similar carve-out --- for now. Western sanctions
allow it to keep selling energy, the largest source of Moscow's
revenues. Last year, Russia earned a hundred and nineteen billion
dollars from oil-and-gas sales --- when the price averaged only
sixty-nine dollars a barrel. This month, prices soared to a hundred and
fifteen dollars a barrel. Even if the West, under mounting pressure,
does opt to sanction Russian energy resources, it could backfire ---
creating an oil crisis in the West and driving up prices globally, while
Russia simply switches to other buyers. (Many countries, notably China,
have not cut off trade with Russia.)

South Africa, during the era of racial apartheid, was widely considered
a rare sanctions success story, Steil told me. In 1962, a resolution by
the U.N. General Assembly called on member states to sever all
diplomatic, military, and economic ties. Yet carve-outs in subsequent
international sanctions again diluted their effect. International
sanctions excluded "strategic materials," as well as coal, diamonds, and
some forms of gold, which South Africa produced in abundance. As a
result, sanctions had minimal impact on the daily life of ruling whites.
Over time, South Africa became more self-sufficient. Facing an embargo
on energy imports, it developed a world-class system to make oil from
coal. Once dependent on arms imports, it ramped up production and became
a net exporter. And, for all the pressure and cut-offs, South Africa was
still able to develop its first nuclear device in 1982, and by 1989 it
had six bombs. The white government finally released Nelson Mandela in
1990. Amid tectonic global political shifts, apartheid ended --- three
decades after the first sanctions.

[[Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark} was one of the worst sanctions failures,
[[demonstrat]{.mark}ing]{.underline} that [[dictators willing to
**starve**]{.mark} **their people** and isolate their
countries]{.underline} can [simply ignore them]{.underline}. In 1990,
President Saddam Hussein's unprovoked invasion of Kuwait spawned the
same kind of international fury visible today over Putin's aggression
against Ukraine. Within four days of Iraq's attack, the U.N. imposed
sanctions that banned world trade with Baghdad. Saddam refused to
withdraw. Six months later, a U.S.-led military assault expelled Iraqi
forces, but the Iraqi leader refused to comply with the terms of the
ceasefire. [Sanctions]{.underline} dragged on. The [toll was
**horrific**]{.underline}. By 1997, a third of Iraqi children were
malnourished, according to unicef. In 1999, the Red Cross reported that
the economy of Iraq --- which once had one of the highest standards of
living in the oil-rich Middle East --- was "in tatters." The suffering
had little impact on Saddam; he balked at coöperating with U.N.
inspectors charged with monitoring his weapons of mass destruction. In
2003, the U.S. launched a second invasion --- and Saddam was eventually
caught and executed. [Dictators]{.underline} often [ignore
sanctions]{.underline}, [**no matter** the cost]{.underline} to
themselves or their states. Putin, so far, seems not to care, either.

Sanctions and embargoes on North Korea, first imposed after the Korean
War in the nineteen-fifties, have been a total failure. Over three
generations, the Kim dynasty has only become more belligerent, better
armed, and more obstinate. In 2000, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright went to Pyongyang to offer a deal --- some sanctions relief and
humanitarian aid in exchange for limits on its ambitious
ballistic-missile program. North Korea was emerging from a historic
four-year famine that reportedly killed millions, but the talks failed.
Four subsequent U.S. Presidents imposed ever-tougher sanctions on North
Korea. The world's most isolated regime is now estimated to have dozens
of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles to fire them across Asia and
the Pacific.

The Biden Administration said that the new sanctions on Russia were
based on the "Iran model." But four decades of embargoes and sanctions
on Tehran have repeatedly failed to change the regime's calculus. The
U.S. first imposed sanctions after fifty-two American diplomats were
taken hostage in Tehran, in 1979; it took fourteen months to free them.
More sanctions were imposed in the mid-nineteen-eighties for state
sponsorship of terrorism. Sanctions were intensified in the
nineteen-nineties and again in 2005, amid suspicions about Iran's
ambition to make a nuclear bomb. In 2013, Tehran, under a new President,
finally agreed to negotiate. "I racked up about a million frequent-flier
miles to get this much concerted action on Iran," Stuart Levey, the
Treasury official who orchestrated sanctions on Iran, told me.

[Sanctions]{.underline}, however, are also [[subject to]{.mark} the
whims of **[domestic politics]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Three years into
the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, Donald Trump abandoned it and imposed more
than a thousand new sanctions on Tehran. His goal was to get Iran to
negotiate a broader deal. He failed abysmally. In retaliation, Iran
breached limits on its nuclear program.

[Sanctions [rarely change]{.mark}]{.underline} a [**[regime's]{.mark}
ideology** or [behavior]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia will, no doubt,
face severe economic pain for its invasion of Ukraine. Putin "grossly
underestimated" the political will of the West to enact such a complex
set of sanctions, including on Putin, Steil told me. In a joint
statement on Friday, the G-7 warned that it will continue to impose
"severe" sanctions. The group of the world's most powerful economies
demanded that Russia end its invasion. But [[history
shows]{.underline}]{.mark} that [the [economic weapon is]{.mark} a
**[limited]{.mark} one**]{.underline}. [And]{.underline} sanctions alone
are [unlikely to get the ruthless thug in Moscow to stop]{.underline}.

## Soft Law

### 1nc Fails Vague 

#### Soft law lacks precision causing indeterminate norms and noncompliance

**Beard, 07** (Jack M Beard, 1-11-2007, \"Soft Law's Failure on the
Horizon: The International Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities,\"
University of Nebraska - Lincoln,
<https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/spacelaw/87/>, LASA-CSK)

One important [[soft law]{.mark} design]{.underline} choice in
constructing many international instruments [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
the decision to employ **[[vague, imprecise, ambiguous]{.mark} or
otherwise [indeterminate]{.mark}]{.underline}** language. [Indeterminate
language]{.underline} may be a satisfactory design feature for some
areas of international cooperation, but [it [is]{.underline}]{.mark} [a
[dangerous]{.mark} choice [for arms control
regimes]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [requirements]{.underline} typically
associated [with arms control regimes]{.underline} are well known, and
one is that they "[must define cheating]{.underline} quite
[explicitly.]{.underline}"104 There are fundamental reasons for this
requirement. [A state contemplating foregoing the development and
deployment of new weapon systems in favor of pursuing international
cooperation will be reluctant to do so if adversary states are not part
of a collaborative regime with a degree of formalization.]{.underline}
[Such a]{.underline} collaborative [regime "must specify what
constitutes cooperation and what constitutes cheating]{.underline}, and
each actor must be assured of its ability to spot immediately others'
cheating."105 The dilemma of common interests in this scenario, against
the backdrop of perceived security threats, is often modeled in game
theory as a prisoners' dilemma in which each state actor's dominant
strategy is to cheat (even if all actors would actually prefer arms
control or disarmament over a spiraling arms race).106 It is in this
context that game theorists and other writers argue that the
[obligations in an arms control regime must be sufficiently precise to
ensure that actors can recognize defection]{.underline}.107 [Elaborate
[monitoring, policing and compliance verification]{.mark}
structures]{.underline} in such a regime [[have little value]{.mark}
without clear obligations]{.underline} and the ability to recognize
cheating. Precision in individual commitments, as well as coherence
between those commitments and broader legal principles, framed by
"accepted modes of legal discourse and argument," also assist by
discouraging states from engaging in "auto-interpretation" and other
opportunistic behavior regarding their obligations.108 [**The [lack of
precision]{.mark}** in individual commitments]{.underline}, [**which
[gives rise to indeterminate normative standards]{.mark}**, thus makes
it harder for states to know what conformity is expected
and]{.underline} also [[ma**kes it easier for states**]{.mark} **[to
justify noncompliance]{.mark}**]{.underline}.109 Conversely, the
[**[lack of precision]{.mark}**]{.underline} may also **[[result
in]{.mark} [uncertainty and tension]{.mark}]{.underline}** as some
states attempt to assert highly restrictive interpretations of ambiguous
terms. To avoid these problems, especially in the area of arms control,
a nation is likely to "seek to describe the performance expected of the
other nation as clearly and precisely as possible in the agreement."110
Thus, in pursuing major arms control agreements with the Soviet Union,
the United States "opted for increasingly detailed agreements, on the
ground that they reduce interpretative leeway."

### AT Plan Says "SC" 

#### The term "SC" is meaningless -- plan vagueness means fiat can't solve

[[A lack of foreign policy that properly defines]{.underline}]{.mark} a
strategy of [**[security cooperation]{.underline}** [has led to its
inappropriate use]{.underline}. [If SC is going to achieve any measure
of]{.underline}]{.mark} substantial [[success]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[practitioners]{.underline}]{.mark}** of foreign policy at all levels
[**[must clearly and precisely articulate the policy]{.underline}**
**[that would lead to the proper use of SC]{.underline}**]{.mark} as a
strategy. Author Colin Gray illustrates the point that strategy and
policy are not synonyms in one of his monographs. Strategy and policy
are not synonymous. However, a sustainable strategy can serve only a
sustainable policy. If the latter oscillates, the former becomes
impractical. This monograph targets primarily the national, or grand,
strategic level of analysis, but it cannot ignore the challenge of
ascertaining and sustaining a coherent national security policy.
Carelessly or for stylistic variety, many politicians, analysts, and
commentators employ the terms policy and strategy interchangeably. This
malpractice does not scar these pages. The distinction matters crucially
and needs to be maintained rigorously. Policy sets goals, indeed may
well change goals, while strategy is always instrumental. [[In the
absence of a]{.underline} r]{.mark}easonably [**[stable
policy]{.underline}**, [strategy becomes **literally
meaningless**]{.underline}]{.mark}; it must lack political direction.132

#### Precision key to effectiveness

Background and Need for the Study

[The **precise use of words** by Department of Defense officials is
critical to **formulating and executing** military
strategy]{.underline}.11 [When developing a plan of action, **loosely
defined military terms** can affect planners' abilities to properly
understand the actual capabilities resident in a proposed course of
action]{.underline}.12 In Afghanistan, the misapplication of the
military term security cooperation fostered a climate that caused the
Department of Defense and State to underestimate the significant role of
SC in fostering the diplomatic relationships that contribute to
international peace and stability.

#### Specificity is necessary in the context of SC

**Fenell 11**, Captain, US Marine Corps, MA in International Studies @ U
San-Fran (Nathan, "Security Cooperation Poorly Defined,"
<https://repository.usfca.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1020&context=thes)//BB>

[Words have meaning and the unique ideas that are transmitted through
the use of military vocabulary demand that the author and the orator
communicate with **specificity** and **clarity**]{.underline}. [In the
case of security cooperation]{.underline}, my research indicates that
military professionals, government officials, and academics appear to be
equally guilty of failing to limit their use of the term to its correct
context. Most egregiously, **[the term is being improperly
used]{.underline}** as an important element that describes the United
States exit strategy from Afghanistan.21 An example of the recent
comments made by the Secretary of State as she described the current
state of affairs in Washington, D.C. and Afghanistan, that the State
Department convened an interagency team, including DOD, USAID, and the
NSC and held discussions that resulted in an agreement that included
strong commitments on economic/social development, democratic
institution-building, human rights, anticorruption, and other important
long-term reforms. Mrs. Secretary follows up on this statement by
saying; "Ambassador Crocker and General Allen are still working through
some of the security cooperation issues with President Karzai".22 To
place these comments into context, the Honorable Mrs. Clinton was
incorrectly describing the peace process in Afghanistan and the withdraw
of U.S. forces as security cooperation.

### 2ac at coop fails -- privacy

#### US will always compromise -- economic incentives, big tech pressure, & Biden foreign policy

of International Studies (RSIS) of Nanyang Technological University
(NTU) in Singapore. She is also a non-resident research fellow at the
Intellisia Institute in Guangzhou, China. ("BEHIND THE US CONCESSIONS TO
THE EU ON TRANSATLANTIC DATA TRANSFERS," AsiaGlobal Online, 04/13/2022,
<https://www.asiaglobalonline.hku.hk/behind-us-concessions-eu-transatlantic-data-transfers>
) PJW

While [the [US and E]{.mark}]{.underline}uropean
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nion [[announced]{.mark} agreement]{.underline}
in principle [on [a new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy
Framework]{.mark},]{.underline} the fundamental differences between the
approaches of the two sides to data governance remain, writes Li Xirui
of the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang
Technological University in Singapore.

During US President Joe Biden's March visit to Europe, the European
Commission and the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[announced]{.underline} that [they]{.underline} had [agreed]{.underline}
in principle [on a new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework (TADPF). It
is a breakthrough between the two parties on data transfers after the
Privacy Shield was invalidated by the Court of Justice of the European
Union (CJEU)]{.underline} in 2020 [due to concerns about the
shortcomings in US laws that impede the protection of personal data and
are in conflict with Europe's General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR).]{.underline}

Such an [agreement could not have been reached without what the Biden
administration called "unprecedented commitments" made by the
US.]{.underline} The legal text of the framework has yet to be
published, but the [US has [promised to address]{.mark} the CJ[EU's
concerns on data privacy]{.mark} and security.]{.underline} Some of the
measures are specified in the statement released by [the White
House]{.underline}. For instance, it [will put new safeguards to ensure
that surveillance activities are necessary and proportionate in pursuit
of defined national security objectives. It will establish a multi-layer
independent redress mechanism with binding authority that can apply
remedial measures, and it will enhance rigorous and layered oversight of
signals intelligence activities.]{.underline}

After a yearlong battle over data traffic between the two parties,
[[why]{.mark} did the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [make
such compromises? No doubt [economic interests]{.mark} mattered, but the
ongoing [Ukraine]{.mark}-Russia [war made the deal]{.mark} more
[imperative]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although the announcement of the TADPF
provides temporary relief for businesses which faced uncertainty over
their ability to move data between the US and Europe, the future of the
EU-US cooperation on digital data traffic is not promising due to the
divergence between the two sides in their data governance approaches and
underlying norms.

Given the ever more digitalized world economy, the [significance of data
flows is profound. [Trade]{.mark} and investment [between]{.mark} the
[US and Europe, valued]{.mark} at US\$[7]{.mark}.1 [trillion, are
underpinned by]{.mark} digital [data flows]{.mark} between the
two.]{.underline} In 2020, [Europe was the US's main commercial partner
in the digital economy.]{.underline} The US registered a surplus of
US\$105 billion in the trade of digitally-enabled services with Europe;
it exported US\$247 billion and imported US\$142 billion.

About 46 percent of US digitally enabled services were exported to
Europe, while about 45 percent of those services was imported from
across Atlantic Ocean. The trade in digitally enabled services between
the US and Europe was much more than US digital trade with the rest of
the world. Meanwhile, the US only accounted for about 14 percent of
total exports and 25 percent of total imports of the digitally enabled
services of the 27 EU members. This data indicate that [the **[US
depends more on the EU]{.mark}** in terms of the development of the
digital economy rather the other way around.]{.underline}

[The US government is recognizing the need to cooperate with big
technology firms, even as these companies are **putting more and more
pressure on Washington** on digital trade policy.]{.underline} The Biden
administration has been partnering with tech giants on cybersecurity.
Meanwhile, [[due to]{.mark} the close links between them, including
[donations]{.mark} to the president's election campaign, [appointments
of tech]{.mark}-sector [executives to]{.mark} senior [government]{.mark}
positions, [and]{.mark} the extensive [lobbying]{.mark} activities by
the companies, the **[White House]{.mark} simply [cannot ignore the
demands of]{.mark} the [tech giants]{.mark}** such as Meta Platforms,
Alphabet and Microsoft.]{.underline} While they are headquartered in the
US, [Europe is a large market for them. The [lack of]{.mark} an
[agreement on data transfers]{.mark} between the EU and the US created
uncertainties and [risks]{.mark} including the possibility of
[suspension of their operations in Europe]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Meta Platforms]{.underline}, the parent company of Facebook and
Instagram, had openly stated that it [may be forced to retreat from
Europe if authorities on both sides of the Atlantic cannot reach a new
framework on data flow to replace Privacy Shield.]{.underline} Europe is
the group's second largest market after the US and Canada. Going by 2020
data, [withdrawal from the European market would mean the loss of 24
percent of the company's total revenue and 25 percent of its
turnover.]{.underline} Meta Platform and other [**US [tech
giants]{.mark} simply [cannot afford to lose]{.mark} lucrative [European
market]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The major tech firms are not able to
address the EU's concerns over data privacy by themselves without the US
federal government making improvements to data law and regulations. This
means that the [tech companies will]{.underline} have to [step up their
engagement with Washington.]{.underline}

[Without doubt, economic interests are the main motivation for the Biden
administration to reach a deal on transatlantic data
transfers.]{.underline} But they are not sufficient enough a reason to
explain why a compromise has now been reached after over a year of
negotiations. [There is certainly a geopolitical imperative that
prompted Washington to agree to compromise: Russia's war on
Ukraine.]{.underline}

When [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} came into office in January 2021, he
[vowed]{.underline} to European allies that "America is back", [that
"the transatlantic alliance is back".]{.underline} Under his leadership,
[the US has]{.underline} significantly increased its engagement with
Europe and [[reaffirmed]{.mark} its commitment to]{.underline} the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO). Speeding up]{.mark} transatlantic
[coop]{.mark}eration [on tech]{.mark}nology [is a very important part
of]{.mark} Washington's [re-engagement]{.mark} efforts.]{.underline}

On his first visit to Europe last year, Biden agreed to set up the US-EU
Trade and Technology Council (TTC). It followed that on this recent
trip, he would reach a preliminary deal on data transfers. The US is
looking to forge a transatlantic tech alliance. This would be a logical
step in shoring up the security alliance that was so damaged under the
previous administration of Donald Trump, who had openly expressed doubts
about the utility of NATO and was critical of fellow members for puling
their fair share of the costs of the defense of Europe. [Reversing
Trump's approach was a priority on Biden's foreign-policy agenda, made
all the more critical since Russia invaded Ukraine]{.underline} on
February 24, with President Vladimir Putin contending that his actions
were compelled by NATO's expansion to his country's borders.

[Maintaining unity between the US and EU has become an extremely
important and urgent goal for the US since the outbreak of the war in
Ukraine.]{.underline} The White House acknowledged that Biden's visit to
Europe in March was to consolidate the cohesion of the West in
countering Moscow. While in Europe, in addition to the data transfers
concessions, the US also made key offers of support to Europe on energy
security.

The EU and US agree that financial and economic sanctions are important
to stop Russia's war in Ukraine. But due to its heavy reliance on
Russian gas and oil, the EU has hesitated to impose sanctions on
Russia's energy exports. In the joint statement aimed at addressing
European energy supply concerns, the US promised to boost shipment of
liquified natural gas (LNG) to Europe immediately and over the longer
term. This demonstrated Washington's willingness to contribute to EU
energy security at this critical time. By issuing the joint statement on
TADPF, the US also expressed its understanding of and willingness to
assuage European worries on data transfers and security. These two
statements clearly underscored the Biden administration's determination
to strengthen mutual trust between the US and EU, bolster the
transatlantic alliance, and solidify their joint efforts against Russia
over Ukraine.

### 2ac AT No Cred -- Afghanistan 

#### Afghanistan won't harm US credibility.

**Walt '21** --- Stephen; a columnist at Foreign Policy and the Robert
and Renée Belfer professor of international relations at Harvard
University. August 21, 2021; \"Afghanistan Hasn't Damaged U.S.
Credibility\"; *Foreign Policy*;
https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/08/21/afghanistan-hasnt-damaged-u-s-credibility/;
//CYang & sg \<33

Stephens is probably beyond redemption at this point, and the Global
Times is a propaganda rag whose views should be discounted, but everyone
else needs to take a deep breath and relax. In fact, there are [**ample
reasons** to believe]{.underline} that the [tragic outcome in
[Afghanistan]{.mark} will [not affect U.S. **credibility**]{.mark} very
much and maybe **not [at all]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The [first reason is **simple logic**]{.underline}. [Deciding not to
continue a **futile war** for less-than-vital interests tells you
**absolutely nothing**]{.underline} about whether a great power would
fight if more serious interests were at stake. [[**No one** would
conclude]{.mark} [that withdrawing from Afghanistan]{.mark}]{.underline}
after 20 years, 2,500 Americans dead, and more than \$1 trillion spent
[[implies]{.underline}]{.mark} that the United States would not fight
fiercely to defend Alaska, Hawaii, or Florida. Nor should any serious
person conclude the [[United States would not fight to prevent China
from establishing hegemony]{.mark} in Asia [or]{.mark} to [thwart a
]{.mark}]{.underline}[(]{.mark}highly unlikely) [[Russian
assault]{.mark} on NATO]{.underline}. The reason is simple: In each of
these instances, [we are talking about **vital interests** that could
affect U.S. security in profoundly significant ways.]{.underline}

Moreover, by [[eliminating **a long-term drain** on]{.mark} U.S.
[resources]{.mark}]{.underline} (even a minimal U.S. presence in
Afghanistan was costing more than \$40 billion a year), getting out of
Afghanistan [will [allow the United States to **focus time, money, and
attention on bigger priorities**]{.mark}. America's ability to defend
other interests and the attention it can devote to them will increase,
[making its]{.mark} remaining [commitments **more credible**]{.mark}
**rather than less**.]{.underline} As George F. Kennan said in the
context of Vietnam, "There is more respect to be won in the opinion of
the world by a resolute and courageous liquidation of unsound positions
than by the most stubborn pursuit of extravagant or unpromising
objectives."

History offers a second source of reassurance. [The United States
suffered [an **equally humiliating defeat in
Vietnam**]{.mark}]{.underline}, after losing more than 50,000 troops.
[Yet the U.S. withdrawal]{.underline} and subsequent fall of Saigon
[[**did not cause** NATO to]{.mark} [collapse]{.mark}, did not lead
[U.S. allies in Asia to realign with the Soviet Union or China]{.mark},
and did not inspire [America's]{.mark} various [Middle East client
states to run]{.mark} for the exits.]{.underline} Kennan was right:
Ending that war allowed the U.S. military to undertake a much-needed
rebuilding of its conventional forces---especially in Europe, which had
been neglected during the Vietnam era---and 14 years later, it was the
Soviet Union that ended up in the dustbin of history. Yes, dominos did
fall but mostly in Eastern Europe.

[One could say much **[the same thing about lesser setbacks]{.mark}**,
such as the fall of the Shah of Iran in 1979, the U.S. disengagement
from Lebanon in 1984, the U.S. withdrawal from Somalia in 1994, or the
failed U.S. occupation of Iraq]{.underline}. These events did have
serious negative consequences, but none of them led other states to
conclude that the United States was no longer a formidable power whose
support was an asset to be sought and valued.

And the United States is hardly the only example. [Great
Britain]{.underline} was long derided by European statesmen as
"perfidious Albion" because it [made and broke alliances as its
interests required, but that didn't prevent other states from allying
with London]{.underline} when they needed its help and it was in
Britain's interest to provide it. [[Governments]{.underline}]{.mark} of
all kinds [[know that commitments are most credible when they
**reflect**]{.mark} **powerful [common interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}
and that blind loyalty rarely determines what major powers will do.

Third, [one should [take]{.mark}]{.underline} foreign [[complaints
about]{.mark} U.S. [cred]{.mark}ibility [with **many grains of
salt**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Elites in [[countries]{.underline}]{.mark}
who have become [[dependent on U.S]{.mark}. protection have a long
history of [question]{.mark}ing America's [reliability i]{.mark}n
an]{.underline} all-too-transparent [attempt [to get Washington to do
more on their behalf]{.mark}]{.underline}. Every time Uncle Sam fails to
achieve some foreign-policy objective or decides not to pour more
resources into a losing proposition, you can bet that some ally
somewhere will pop up and declare that they just aren't sure they can
trust the United States anymore. In most cases, Washington responds by
sending them more weapons or by having top officials fly in to hold
their hands and offer up additional pledges of support. If we really are
as smart as we think we are, we ought to be on to this game by now.

To be fair, both the long war in Afghanistan and its tragic denouement
could have a negative impact on America's reputation, but the
reliability of its commitments isn't the real issue. Bear in mind that
the United States didn't cut and run in 2006 or 2009 or 2011 or even
2017, even when many of its partners there were heading for the exits.
As I have argued before, [a [key element of America's global]{.mark}
[influence is]{.mark} a **reputation for competence and good judgment**,
including a hardheaded [ability to read a situation, make tough choices,
select realistic objectives, and]{.mark} then [carry out a well-designed
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} What just happened in
Afghanistan casts doubt on whether the U.S. foreign-policy establishment
is still capable of these tasks, but doubts on that score have been
growing for more than two decades. The proper lesson is not that the
United States ought to fight more stupid wars for the sake of so-called
credibility but that it needs to start holding those responsible for
these repeated errors accountable and try to figure out why they keep
making the same mistakes.

### 2ac AT Burden-Sharing Disputes

#### Burden-sharing disputes [will not]{.underline} destroy NATO -- their strengths [outweigh]{.underline} weaknesses

[NATO's ability to incorporate a large number of member]{.underline}
countrie[s and to broaden the agenda according to the current security
context are]{.underline} some of [the Alliance's most
significant]{.underline} advantages and [strengths. On the other side of
the coin there is,]{.underline} however, [the risk of
over-expansion]{.underline} of membership and tasks. [The
growing]{.underline} and diversifying [membership]{.underline} along
with the ever-growing task list [are closely linked to the
burden-sharing debate as the Alliance needs to allocate scarce resources
to accommodate]{.underline} the needs of [more allies]{.underline} and
to manage tasks that range from territo- rial defence to human
emergencies, such as the Covid-19 pandemic. [The ultimate issue
is]{.underline} thus not that the allies' contributions are imbalanced
but [that the amount of demands for NATO is growing. It is]{.underline}
possible, even [likely]{.underline}, that the [burden-sharing debate
will intensify in the future. It is, however, important not to look at
the burden-sharing debate **from too narrow a perspective**, which might
lead us into the conclusion that the debate endangers the existence of
the]{.underline} whole [Alliance]{.underline}. As we have pointed out,
[burden-sharing should]{.underline} not [be considered]{.underline} as a
separate discussion but [as an economic, political and social phenomenon
that is]{.underline} formed of a [complex]{.underline} set of
interlinked factors. Considering this and the reasons behind
organisational termination and survival, **[it is premature to claim
that burden-sharing disputes]{.underline}** alone [**could lead to
NATO's crumbling.** The debate is closely linked to other
problems,]{.underline} such as trust issues among allies and diverse
threat perceptions, which can severely damage NATO's ability to survive
future crisis. On the other hand, **[NATO's strengths]{.underline}**
discussed above **[balance these weaknesses and speak against the
possibility of termination of NATO even when facing severe
crisis.]{.underline}**

#### Disputes over burden-sharing [won't endanger]{.underline} the alliance, they only [strengthen]{.underline} its [resilience]{.underline} to internal disagreement

[The "arrow" of this course of developments suggests that the scope and
diversity of NATO burden-sharing disputes is growing]{.underline} and
likely to grow further in the near future. In effect, [the
burden-sharing discourse is]{.underline} in the process of [spilling
over from its traditional domains.]{.underline} In terms of forecasting,
this course of development suggests that [this expansion will take at
least three forms]{.underline} in the next few years: [First, domestic
politics within members]{.underline} seem to [count more and more
in]{.underline} the development of [burden-sharing
disputes.]{.underline} This dimension is not new, as the age-old [guns
vs butter predicament has always loomed large among NATO]{.underline}
members, and as the US Congress has often been the venue for such
arguments. Still, [in most NATO countries, questions of security policy
have]{.underline} traditionally [been left outside of day-to-day
domestic political quibbles. However,]{.underline} the advent of [the
rise of populism, non-liberal political forces in several NATO
countries, and the]{.underline} overall [increasingly transactional
approach to i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations, [are
likely to shape the domestic willingness in]{.underline} several [member
countries to engage in multi- lateral security
co-operation.]{.underline} [Second, whilst the "classical" debate on
military expenditure is likely to]{.underline} remain, or even [dominate
NATO agenda, the transatlantic discourse on burden-sharing is
increasingly likely to cover non-military domains such as comprehensive
security, resilience, security co-operation, and diplomacy.]{.underline}
Instead of closed-door interstate bargaining, [the political space of
NATO seems to be more and more dominated by a bidding race]{.underline}
both [on NATO and domestic fora of]{.underline} what is [one's
contribution to common good.]{.underline} [Third, burden-sharing
disputes are likely to extend beyond]{.underline} the level of [NATO
itself as partner countries are also likely to be dragged into these
disputes]{.underline} and into the discourse of burden-sharing. Be it
defence co-operation, joint exercises, or participation in peace
operations, [partners are likely to face an environment emphasising
demands of good partner- ship, reputational resources, constructive
approach, and]{.underline} other forms of [contribution
from]{.underline} the [involved countries.]{.underline} [These
developments notwithstanding, **the intensity of burden-sharing disputes
is not likely to endanger the existence of the Alliance.**]{.underline}
During its 70 years' existence, [**NATO has proved its ability to
withstand internal strains**. Even though many
contributions]{.underline}, such as Richter and Driver [have regarded
unequal burden-sharing as a threat for NATO]{.underline}60; [and this
article started by noting the]{.underline} inherent
[dangers]{.underline} caused by burden-sharing disputes, [the overall
picture seems to be more multi-dimensional.]{.underline} After all, in
many respects [the Alliance indeed faces change]{.underline} and
progress [though argument. Debate may be one of NATO's defining
characteristics. It may also be necessary]{.underline} in order [to
define and redefine its strategic purpose]{.underline}. In this regard,
**[disputes related to burden-sharing can also be seen as a
manifestation of the Alliance's ability to withstand and accommodate
internal disagreement,]{.underline}** sometimes for protracted periods
of time.

\[TITLE\]: "[[No consensus]{.underline}]{.mark}? [[No
problem]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Why [NATO is **still
effective**]{.mark}]{.underline}"

[[Critics]{.underline}]{.mark} of the alliance (and even some
supporters) have [[interpreted NATO's unwillingness to]{.mark}
**militarily [support]{.mark}** [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
especially during the most significant challenge to the European
security order since the Cold War --- [[as]{.underline}]{.mark} an
[[indicator of]{.mark} its **[declining
relevance]{.mark}**]{.underline}, timidity, or its divisions. [But that
[overstates]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[importance of]{.mark} **political
[consensus]{.mark}** to NATO's value [and
understates]{.mark}]{.underline} its [[role as]{.mark} an **effective
and [flexible]{.mark}** defensive [alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
is a role [with **potentially critical** benefits]{.underline} for
Ukraine.

First, it [sets **too high** a bar for an alliance]{.underline} of
thirty members [with aligned]{.underline}, [but distinct]{.underline},
[priorities]{.underline}. Unanimity on every issue is impossible, let
alone one as complex as military support to Ukraine. [[**Debate** and
**disagreement**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as it should be for any
democratic institution, [[are]{.mark} **built-in [features]{.mark} of
NATO**]{.underline} --- [[not bugs]{.underline}]{.mark}. In reality,
[it's astounding how often NATO **does reach consensus**]{.underline}
about issues big and small, creating an unrealistic expectation that it
always will. The opposite of consensus is not failure. [[Suggesting
otherwise]{.underline}]{.mark} turns any debate that doesn't end
harmoniously into an indictment of NATO, [playing **straight into
[Russian propaganda]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Second, a belief that NATO's value is tied primarily to achieving
consensus on every issue [misses the more]{.underline} mundane (and
[important]{.underline}) [ways it supports its allies and
partners]{.underline}. Its [affinity for [process]{.mark}]{.underline}
--- particularly its [ability to [build]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[[common]{.mark} **situational [understanding]{.mark}**]{.underline}
among its members --- [is]{.underline} an [invaluable]{.underline} tool.
[Habits of [consultation]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[info]{.mark}rmation
[sharing]{.mark}]{.underline}, [buttressed by **deep
[cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline} on operations,
[[intel]{.mark}ligence [sharing]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[defense
planning]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and
[interoperability]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[create]{.mark} the
[foundation]{.mark} up[on which]{.mark}]{.underline} any
[[consensus]{.mark} is to be [built]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Even in the
absence of]{.underline} that [agreement]{.underline}, the [ability to
**collectively define** threats and jointly]{.underline} train to
[confront them is **immensely valuable**]{.underline} in its own right.

Third, these [habits of cooperation give NATO members]{.underline} the
**[[flexibility]{.underline}]{.mark}** to act outside of the Alliance's
frameworks. While NATO does much by consensus --- such as its missions
in the Baltic states --- the skills it [helps members
develop]{.underline} is [central to [enabl]{.mark}ing them to
form]{.underline} separate [[coalitions]{.mark} for action]{.underline}.
This [happened recently [with]{.mark} **ample [success]{.mark}** in
taking on the **I**slamic **S**tate]{.underline}. Such
[[flexibility]{.underline}]{.mark} should be [[a]{.mark} point in NATO's
[favor]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[not]{.underline}]{.mark} evidence of its
[[ineptitude]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In the case of military support for Ukraine, policymakers will find more
attractive alternatives for dealing with Moscow's aggression outside of
the auspices of the Alliance. Up to and including its recent dialogue
with Russia, it has taken a host of consensus actions to support Ukraine
--- from condemning Kremlin aggression and standing up for Kyiv
politically to reaffirming its open-door policy with an expectation that
Ukraine will eventually become a member. It might even share
intelligence and develop training and advisory programs for the
Ukrainian military.

And while it won't find a consensus to fight, it could [[provide]{.mark}
the [**foundation** for]{.mark}]{.underline} certain [allies to
support]{.underline} Ukrainian forces [in ways **consistent**
with]{.underline} their [national [priorities]{.mark} **outside of
NATO**]{.underline}. In that case, [NATO's enabling value to its
members]{.underline} in [complicating Putin's cost-benefit
assessment]{.underline} should be applauded.

Last week's NATO-Russia Council meeting showcased an Alliance working in
lockstep and finding political consensus in responding to preposterous
Russian demands. NATO should always strive for this degree of consensus.
But if and when this crisis intensifies, and Putin advances further into
Ukraine, expectations for NATO assistance will be raised, decisions
about how to respond will become more difficult, and consensus will be
more elusive.

Despite the rhetoric we might hear in response, [**[this is]{.mark} not
evidence** of NATO's ineffectiveness]{.underline} --- but rather a
reflection of [[how **democratic institutions**
function]{.underline}]{.mark}. And even absent consensus, NATO can still
contribute invaluably to Ukraine's sovereignty.

**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} that acted to
[[disrupt]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[international **peace**]{.mark} **and
stability**]{.underline}," but never mind that for now.
[[If]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[credibility]{.underline}]{.mark} of U.S.
promises [[is]{.mark} the **[key]{.mark} to world peace**]{.underline},
[one wonders why the world didn't come unglued after]{.underline} the

Korea]{.underline} got away with [seizing the USS

the [Black Hawk Down debacle in [Somalia]{.mark}]{.underline}, or after
former U.S. President Bill Clinton opted not to intervene in the
[[Rwandan genocide]{.underline}]{.mark}. Maybe [[U.S. credibility is
neither]{.underline}]{.mark} as [[**fragile** nor]{.mark} as
**[essential]{.mark}**]{.underline} as hard-liners think.

More importantly, this [view assumes]{.underline} that [security
guarantees]{.underline} --- in particular, guarantees issued by the
United States --- [are the **main ingredient** in global
peace]{.underline}, [leaving]{.underline} little or [no role
for]{.underline} [negotiation]{.underline}, [compromise]{.underline},
[reassurance]{.underline}, [or other diplomatic efforts]{.underline} to
give potential rivals less reason to challenge the status quo. It is
also worth noting that the [[positive]{.mark} effect[s of]{.mark} a
**successful defense of [credibility]{.mark}**
[never]{.mark}]{.underline} seem to [[last]{.mark} very
long]{.underline}: No matter what the [**[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} did the last time it was challenged, it
has to respond as soon as a new problem emerges or else its newly won
[[reputation]{.underline}]{.mark} for resolve may **[[shatter like
glass]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

As you might expect, scholars have explored these issues for years
without reaching a clear consensus. Credibility skeptics --- such as
academics Jonathan Mercer, Ted Hopf, and Daryl Press --- argue that
[[concerns]{.mark} about credibility are **generally
[exaggerated]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[especially
when]{.underline}]{.mark} would-be challengers are [[trying to determine
if a]{.mark}nother [state will fight]{.mark}]{.underline} to defend a
commitment. They point out that [[government]{.mark} officials rarely
base]{.underline} their estimates of what another state will do on the
[[basis of]{.mark} how]{.underline} that [state acted in some
[**unrelated context** in the past]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Rather]{.underline}]{.mark}, they base them [on]{.underline} whether
it has [[interests]{.mark} at stake]{.underline} that are [worth
defending [and]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[capacity]{.mark} to **act
effectively**]{.underline}. Other scholars have challenged this
conclusion, however, arguing that individual leaders acquire reputations
for resolve (or weakness) that persist over time and that past behavior
can influence how potential challengers gauge a defender's level of
interest in a given commitment. States with good reputations may find it
easier to form alliances too. There is also the strong possibility that
reputation and credibility are issue-specific: Whether a state lives up
to the terms of a trade deal may tell you next to nothing about its
reliability as an ally or on an issue like arms control.

### 2ac AT Information Sharing Fails

Current global conflict trends are pulling NATO away from its
traditional collective defense mission into stability and reconstruction
(S&R) operations with greater frequency. [S&R environments require NATO
to collaborate with and support host nation governments, international
organizations, and a range of non-governmental organizations to address
security, political, and social challenges.]{.underline} However, [NATO
encounters difficulty with collecting and sharing intelligence and
information in these environments. This inability to communicate
compounds the already complex issues faced by all entities
involved]{.underline}. This article identifies three policy options to
help NATO improve its support to S&R operations by enhancing
information-sharing mechanisms within NATO and with non-NATO
stakeholders. These options are: 1) [the completion of the Federated
Mission Network that seeks to aggregate classified and unclassified
information in a regulated virtual space]{.underline}; 2) the
indoctrination of a Joint Information Fusion Cell to act as a physical
clearinghouse for information; and 3) the development of Regional
Coordination Centers and Stabilization and Reconstruction Teams to
implement individual S&R projects. A packaged, distributable network
that can be used simultaneously by NATO and its partners to share
classified intelligence, and by IOs, NGOs, and NATO actors to share
unclassified information in a common, minimally regulated space. [NATO
established the Afghan Mission Network (AMN) in 2010. It provided a
federated, classified network that allowed all NATO member states
contributing forces to the International Security Assistance Force
(ISAF) mission to exchange data and intelligence.]{.underline} Certain
non-NATO states were then read on to the AMN using bilateral security
agreements. However, ISAF partners continued to struggle with sharing
information with non-NATO actors providing much-needed services in
Afghanistan. Efforts to use unclassified interfaces, including the All
Partners Access Network (APAN), Civil-Military Fusion Center (CFC),
Protected Information Exchange (PIX), and RONNA-HarmonieWeb, did not
resolve recurring issues of structural obstacles or lack of buy-in.19
NATO has since endeavored to develop a hybrid network, known as the
Federated Mission Network (FMN), to hold both classified and
unclassified material on a single network.20 As the FMN is still under
development, this paper will outline what functions and considerations
should be taken into account for the final product: • A labeling scheme
allowing registered users to submit information across the
classification spectrum, and an access management scheme to limit
information by clearance level • A layered archive and search function
to store classified intelligence at the NATO Top Secret, NATO Secret,
NATO unclassified, and open source levels, respectively • A
user-generated, Wiki-type database for unclassified information, with an
open edit function regulated by a NATO administration team21 • Chat
functions across the classification spectrum to provide for direct
communication between users • A fillable-forms portal allowing NATO and
non-NATO entities to submit requests for information (RFIs) in both
directions, and • A financial trust fund management function for
tracking donations, pairing needs with resources using an open proposal
scheme[. The resulting network would take the form of a distributable,
off-the-shelf product that NATO could deploy to areas of instability and
be used by NATO and non-NATO entities simultaneously]{.underline}.
[Firstly, the FMN brings multiple actors onto a common network and
provides different levels of access to vetted users]{.underline}.
Through the RFI function, the FMN provides an open line of
communication, albeit indirectly, for requesting specific information
from NATO and vice-versa. Admittedly, not all requests will be approved,
especially when the sources and methods used to obtain the information
requested are particularly sensitive. Further, the Wiki function
establishes a one-stop clearinghouse for open-source and unclassified
information, opening new channels for information exchange[. Secondly,
the donations management function, modeled after the Afghanistan
Reconstruction Trust Fund, will improve the efficiency of resource
allocation and will limit cases of fraud.]{.underline}22 This mechanism
holds all registered monetary donations in a common account managed by
the overarching political lead in a S&R context, be it the host nation
government, a UN support mission, or another entity. Because all
entities supporting the overall S&R operation will have access to the
information contained in this element, the opportunity for graft,
embezzlement, and misallocation is greatly reduced. The Request for
Proposal (RFP) function allows local and foreign actors to post needs,
ranging from reconstruction projects to training seminars, and for NGOs
to compete for resource awards designed to fulfill specific, widely
identified needs. [Finally, by developing a packaged, distributable
network, NATO will be able to deploy the FMN alongside the initial
contingent of NATO personnel sent to a S&R environment. From the first
day of an operation, **the FMN can be installed, activated, and have all
dysfunctional elements worked out as the full scope of the mission is
being developed.**]{.underline} The FMN can be set up in multiple
locations at once, using dedicated communications systems to manage
operations separately. **[In this way, NATO can support multiple S&R,
disaster relief, humanitarian aid, and other operations
simultaneously.]{.underline}**

In August 2001, [Operation Essential Harvest contributed significantly
to the de-escalation of ethnic tensions in North Macedonia and prevented
another conflict in the Western Balkans.]{.underline} [Scholars have
neglected to mention the operation in their analysis of NATO
history]{.underline}.3 Security experts often forget about it even when
the focus of their work is the evaluation of NATO's crisis management
capabilities.4 As argued elsewhere, [this is mostly due to the
traditional crisis-driven approach to NATO history where the attention
of scholars keeps focusing on the same 'turning points' or 'moments of
crisis' rather than on the long-term development of the
Alliance.]{.underline}5 The first signs of increased [ethnic tensions
emerged in January 2001 in the town of Tearce, in the northwest of the
country.]{.underline}9 In March 2001, fighting broke out along the North
Macedonia--Kosovo border near the village of Tanuševci and it grew into
a full-blown insurgency carried out by a previously unknown Albanian
guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army (NLA) led by Ali Ahmeti[.
The NLA soon controlled the area around Tetovo, North Macedonia's second
city. Ahmeti had fought in the Kosovo Liberation Army against Slobodan
Milošević and was applying the same military strategies and tactics to
the fight against North Macedonia's security forces.]{.underline}10 Two
attempts to solve the crisis failed in rapid succession: one by the
OSCE's envoy, US Ambassador Bob Frowick; and one by North Macedonia's
President Boris Trajkovski. Frowick brokered a negotiation agreement
that officially included the NLA as one of the interlocutors and which
was therefore received as a betrayal and rejected by the political
parties in Skopje.13 On 14 June, NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson
and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana travelled
to Skopje to support efforts for a political solution to the conflict. A
couple of weeks later, Solana appointed François Léotard as the EU envoy
to Skopje.15 Léotard worked with US Ambassador James W Pardew, who had
been sent to North Macedonia by President George W Bush.16 NATO also
sent a team led by Pieter Feith, a Dutch diplomat who was the head of
the NATO Balkan Task Force. Feith was Lord Robertson's personal
representative and liaised with Mark Laity, who had also been sent by
Robertson to work as Trajkovski's special adviser.17 Lord Robertson used
'personal representatives' to avoid the formal involvement of the North
Atlantic Council (NAC[). At the time, opinion within the NAC was divided
and several member countries were wary of further involvement in the
Balkans as public opinion was critical of NATO's involvement in
Kosovo.]{.underline} The appointment of envoys as the Secretary
General's personal representatives did not require a vote, which was
both faster and diplomatically convenient.18 Feeble as it might have
been, the ceasefire opened a space for diplomatic talks. The Ohrid
Framework Agreement (OFA) was signed on 13 August 2001 at the
presidential holiday retreat near Lake Ohrid.31 According to the
Agreement, the cessation of hostilities would be followed by the
voluntary disarmament and disbandment of the NLA. It established a
pathway for government devolution and the reform of minority political
and cultural rights, which would require specific constitutional
amendments (Annex A) and legislative modifications (Annex B). [The
Agreement included changes to how the country's official languages were
to be recognised: any language spoken by more than 20% of the population
would become a co-official language along with the Macedonian language
at the municipal level. At that point -- and to this day -- only the
Albanian language, with approximately 25% of speakers, qualified as a
co-official language. These provisions laid the basis for the inclusion
of the Albanian minority in North Macedonia's political and civil life
and mapped a pathway to reform.]{.underline}32 Operation Essential
Harvest was officially launched on 22 August 2001. Around 3,800 NATO
troops were deployed.45 In their interviews, both White-Spunner, Chip
Chapman (CO, 2 PARA) and Andrew Budd (military planner at SHAPE[)
stressed the role of special forces for liaison and intelligence
purposes. 22 SAS, along with selected individuals from other allied
countries, were sent to join TFH. Their task was to liaise with the
Albanian rebels of Ali Ahmeti and to gather intelligence while at the

NLA that it was [NATO that was collecting the weapons and that it would
proceed to destroy them as North Macedonia's security forces were not
involved in the operation.46 Operation Essential Harvest accomplished
its mission within schedule]{.underline} and it officially concluded on
26 September 2001. NATO troops collected around 3,785 weapons over 30
days. This included 3,210 assault rifles, 483 machineguns, 161 support
weapons such as mortars and anti-tank weapons, 17 air-defence systems,
two tanks and two armoured personnel carriers. In addition, 397,625
items of mines, explosives and ammunition were collected.48 In one of
the last press conferences, [General Lange stressed that despite the
lack of certainty about whether the NLA held more, 'the turning in of
3,300 weapons is not just a gesture, it is a very real and substantial
effort to remove the combat effectiveness of the so-call \[sic.\] NLA
fighters'.49]{.underline}

[**The leaders of NATO** and the European Union **met in Brussels** last
week, along with G7 leaders, **for an extraordinary trio of summits**
one month after Vladimir Putin began his invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}. While Russia continued its devastating assault
across Ukraine, leaders from Europe, North America, and Japan reinforced
their united front against Moscow's war of aggression, repeating demands
for Russia to end the conflict and withdraw its forces from Ukraine
while increasing the economic and international pressure against the
Kremlin. [They also stood firm with the people of Ukraine, committing to
further economic, humanitarian, and military support. On economic
sanctions, leaders focused on fully implementing existing sanctions
against Russia and Belarus, with the United Kingdom adding new targeted
sanctions. The European Union, NATO, and G7 all announced new measures
to "close loopholes and target actual and possible
circumvention."]{.underline} NATO called specifically on China "to
abstain from supporting Russia's war effort in any way, and to refrain
from any action that helps Russia circumvent sanctions." The EU-China
summit at the end of this week provides another opportunity to make this
point. In providing military support to Ukraine, NATO and the European
Union continue to walk the tightrope between helping Ukraine defend
itself and avoiding escalation into a direct conflict with Russia. NATO
allies committed to provide Ukraine with more defensive weapons, plus
new "cybersecurity assistance" and "equipment to help Ukraine protect
against biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear threats." The
European Union agreed to double its support to the Ukrainian Armed
Forces through the European Peace Facility to €1 billion[. In the short
term, NATO has established four new multinational battlegroups in
Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia---adding to its four existing
missions in Poland and the three Baltic states, which have also been
bolstered.]{.underline} There are now 40,000 forces from all allies
under the direct command of NATO, concentrated in Eastern Europe. These
are supported by air and naval forces positioned from the High North to
the Mediterranean Sea, including an unprecedented five carrier strike
groups. In the longer term, NATO leaders looked to reset their
collective defense and deterrence, stating[, "**We will now accelerate
NATO's transformation** for a more dangerous strategic reality,
including through the adoption of the next Strategic Concept in
Madrid."]{.underline} In the days before its summit, the European Union
also adopted its first defense and security concept, named the
"Strategic Compass," designed to "make the EU a stronger and more
capable security provider."

[It turns out **NATO is neither brain dead nor broken**.]{.underline}
The unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine has given the alliance a new
lease on life, making it more politically united and militarily
formidable than at any time since the end of the Cold War. [**NATO
stands as one** against Russian barbarism in Ukraine. **Even Germany is
boosting its** anemic **defense spending** and finally sending heavy
weaponry to Ukraine.]{.underline} Other states are doing far more, with
the United States, Poland, Canada and Britain leading the way in
providing arms and ammunition[. NATO is doubling the number of
battalion-size "battlegroups" deployed to the front-line states of
Eastern Europe, from four to eight]{.underline}, while the United States
has increased its troop deployment in Europe from 80,000 to 100,000
personnel. With Sweden and Finland as members, **[NATO will hit the
strategic jackpot]{.underline}**. Admitting them to NATO isn't an act of
charity. They are formidable military powers in their own right that can
substantially contribute to deterring further Russian aggression. NATO
should continue to bolster front-line states with permanent, rather than
rotational, troop deployments. The Baltic republics are particularly
vulnerable because they are adjacent to Russia and have their own
populations of Russian speakers, whose presence gives Putin a built-in
excuse for aggression.

[[shifted]{.underline}]{.mark} --- with views on Russia plunging and
views of the United States and NATO remaining positive, even increasing,
a Pew study of 18 nations found.

In Poland, the [shifts have been **[dramatic]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Views on the United States]{.underline}, European Union [and

--- each [hovering **around [90 percent]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- since
the question was first asked in 2007. And views on Russia dropped from
one-third of Poles sharing a favorable view in 2019 to a measly 2
percent in 2022.

![Chart, bar chart Description automatically

Overall, Russia saw a steep decline in its favorability since 2020. All
18 countries surveyed recorded all-time low shares in positive opinions
of the nation --- even as Russia was already seen in a relatively
unfavorable light.

A median of 85 percent across nations saw Russia unfavorably this year.
In the United States, positive views of Russia dropped from 15 percent
in 2020 to 7 percent this year.

Confidence in Russian President Vladimir Putin took a shot too ---
reaching a two-decade low in the majority of places surveyed. Only a
median of 9 percent across nations had confidence in Putin to "do the
right thing regarding world affairs."

Sixty percent felt the same about President Biden, even as his ratings
dropped across most countries over the year.

Among 11 NATO-[[member states]{.underline}]{.mark} and Sweden, a median
of two-thirds [[held positive views]{.mark} of the **military
alliance**]{.underline}. Swedish attitudes of NATO have [grown
**incrementally positive**]{.underline} over the past six years. In
2016, only 58 percent of Swedes surveyed had favorable views of NATO;
the number [gradually [increased]{.mark}]{.underline} to about 70
percent in 2021. Even over the weeks of surveying [in 2022]{.underline},
the [numbers grew further]{.underline} --- from 77 percent around early
March [[to **84 percent**]{.mark} **in mid-April**]{.underline}.

[Views of the United States remained **largely positive** at about 60
percent]{.underline}, the poll found. But while a median of [[79 percent
found the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} to be "[a
**[reliable]{.mark} partner**]{.underline}," a similar percentage
described U.S. partisan conflicts as strong or very strong. In most
countries surveyed, [views of the United States'
reliability]{.underline} as a partner
[[strengthened]{.underline}]{.mark} over the year --- including [[by
**25 percent**]{.underline}]{.mark} in South Korea.

In Poland, [ratings of the **U**nited **S**tates are at an **all-time
high**]{.underline}; [**only 3 percent** of those surveyed
had]{.underline} an [unfavorable view of the nation]{.underline}. That
compares to more than 30 percent with unfavorable U.S. views in Germany,
Canada and the United Kingdom, for example.

The Pew Research Center highlighted Poland, which the center said had
seen a "dramatic shift in attitudes" since the Russian invasion of
Ukraine. Ninety-four percent of Poles surveyed have "no confidence at
all" in Putin and see Russia as a major threat --- with the latter up
from 65 percent in 2018.

At the same time, Poland, which was formerly part of the Soviet Union's
Eastern Bloc and is now a member of both NATO and the E.U., logged
record-high views on the United States, E.U and NATO.

Associate Director of Global Attitudes Research Jacob Poushter told The
Washington Post that "Polish attitudes toward foreign affairs are
affected by domestic political considerations."

In general, he said, people who have unfavorable views of the ruling Law
and Justice party (PiS) tend to see the E.U. more favorably, and say the
27-member bloc promotes prosperity and respects Polish values. And the
same is true of the converse.

360-Degree Approach to Security: Alliance Cohesion and Adaptation After
the Crimean Crisis"; *European Security*, Volume 29, Issue 4; Accessed

To answer this question, this article relies on the
[**[socio-psychologically rooted]{.mark}** alliance [cohesion]{.mark}
literature]{.underline} (Liska 1962, Holsti et al. 1973, Stein 1976,
Thompson and Rapkin 1981, Kupchan 1988, McCalla 1996, Weitsman 2003,
2004, Malici 2005, Kim 2008, Park and Moon 2014). According to Patricia
Weitsman, cohesion is "the ability of states to agree on goals and
strategies toward attaining those goals" (2003, p. 85). Following this
definition, [cohesion [manifests]{.mark}]{.underline} itself
[[through]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[cooperative behaviour]{.mark}** such
as [consultations]{.mark}]{.underline}, [mutual
[concessions]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and [responsiveness towards]{.mark}
each [other's needs]{.mark} [generating **collective
gains**]{.mark}]{.underline}.1 If that behaviour is typical and even
expected within an alliance, the proponents of cohesion theory point out
that conflicting strategic interests and threat perceptions may be
detrimental to group cohesion (Liska 1962, pp. 97--129, Holsti et al.
1973, p. 17, Thompson and Rapkin 1981, p. 615, Malici 2005, p. 93). This
article responds to their argument by hypothesising that
[**consensus-based [bargaining]{.mark}** [within the]{.mark} **Atlantic
[Alliance]{.mark}** [allows]{.mark}]{.underline} for the [[bridging of
**divergent**]{.mark} **threat [perceptions]{.mark}** among allies [and
fosters]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[shared understanding
of]{.underline}]{.mark} their [respective [issues]{.mark}]{.underline}.
According to this hypothesis, the birth of the 360- degree concept and
its implementation shall then embody this spirit of compromise. We
further hypothesise that it is rendered possible by the very nature of
NATO. Scholars no longer dispute the fact that [NATO]{.underline} is a
pluralist security community (Pouliot and Lachmann 2004). It means that
it [is composed of **independent governments** sharing]{.underline}
"[core values]{.underline} derived from common institutions, and [mutual
responsiveness]{.underline} -- a matter of [mutual identity and
loyalty]{.underline}, a [sense of]{.underline} '[we-ness]{.underline},'"
and determined to resolve their disputes peacefully (Adler and Barnett
1998, p. 7). [[NATO allies]{.underline}]{.mark} are then [[incentivised
to talk and cooperate]{.underline}]{.mark} not only [[because of]{.mark}
the **[consensus rule]{.mark}**]{.underline} but also because they
[[form]{.mark} an [institutionalised]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[community

(Risse-Kappen 1997, Park and Moon 2014).

### 2ac AT Threat Perception

#### Russian [threat perception]{.underline} [unifies]{.underline} NATO and [restores cohesion]{.underline} -- [assumes]{.underline} Turkey, Hungary, and France

**Cafiero '22** - CEO of Gulf State Analytics, a Washington, DC-based
geopolitical risk consultancy. He is also an Adjunct Fellow at the
American Security Project (Giorgio, Politics Today, "The Russian Threat
Gives NATO New Purpose",
<https://politicstoday.org/the-russian-threat-gives-nato-new-purpose/>
)//RG

It was [not long ago]{.underline} when [NATO's divisions were running
deep.]{.underline} Until recently, many in the West were questioning the
security alliance's purpose. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Donald
Trump said that if Baltic states weren't "paying their bills" the U.S.
shouldn't necessarily protect them from Russia notwithstanding treaty
obligations. In 2019, French President Emanuele Macron asserted that
NATO was "becoming brain-dead". The following year, tensions between
Greece and Turkey led some experts to conclude that NATO was
"paralyzed". At that time, 70 percent of Turkey's population saw the
U.S., NATO's dominant military force, as a threat to their country. Many
voices in the West accused Germany of being a "shaky alliance partner"
and "NATO's biggest freeloader." [But Russia's invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline} on 24 February [was a geopolitical tsunami that
fundamentally **changed the strategic stakes for NATO members**. Amid
drastic changes in Europe's security architecture, the Western alliance
has regained a sense of purpose. **Today NATO is more unified and
cohesive than it ever has been**]{.underline} since the Soviet Union's
implosion in 1991. ["Threat is the glue that binds together a security
alliance,"]{.underline} explained John Feffer, the director of Foreign
Policy In Focus, in an interview with Politics Today. "**[When the
threat increases]{.underline}**--and there is a consensus on the nature
of the threat--**[the alliance necessarily becomes more
cohesive]{.underline}**. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has served to
smooth over a number of disagreements within the alliance." The
Ankara-based Foreign Policy Institute's Dr Tarik Oguzlu wrote that "as
we witness NATO's European members awaking from their geopolitical
hibernation, [NATO is almost returning to its founding
mission."]{.underline} The war in Ukraine quickly led to a "revolution
in German military affairs" with Berlin now committed to a hike in
defense spending. The Germans put Nord Stream 2 pipeline on hold. Berlin
is also arming the Ukrainian resistance with lethal weapons despite
previously opposing NATO's militarization of Ukraine. For decades, a
handful of Western countries accused Italy of being too Russia-friendly.
But for the past two months, Italy has taken a strong stance against
Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Now closely aligned with the
Transatlantic alliance against Moscow, Rome has supported sanctioning
Russia. As Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi put it, Italy responded
to the President of Ukraine's appeal for weapons because "it's not
possible to respond only with encouragement" when a democratic country
comes under attack. [Talk in western capitals about kicking Turkey out
of NATO has basically come to a sudden end. There has been]{.underline}
somewhat of [a rebound in Ankara-Washington relations]{.underline} as
Turkey arms Kiev with Baykar TB2 drones. Based on shared concerns about
Moscow's conduct in Ukraine, Greece and Turkey have found common cause
since 24 February. NATO's Baltic members have long been far more
alarmist about the Russian threat than those in Western Europe. But such
[**East-West divisions within NATO are going away**. "Western
politicians are now saying]{.underline} to us, [you were
right]{.underline}," Arvydas Anušauskas, Lithuania's Minister of
National Defence, told Al Jazeera. Since 24 February, [NATO members
"have rallied together and acted quickly with new defence and deterrence
measures such as activating the NATO defence plans,]{.underline}
activating elements of the [NATO Response Force, and approving the
deployment of]{.underline} four new multinational
[battlegroups]{.underline} in Eastern Europe," Mihai Chihaia, a policy
analyst at the Brussels-based European Policy Centre, told Politics
Today. "[Reinforcing the Eastern flank has been a top priority and the
**Allies have shown a very high degree of solidarity**]{.underline}. In
addition, the strong commitment to Article 5 (mutual defense) has been
constantly reiterated." Expanding the Alliance NATO is not only becoming
more unified because of a growing common threat perception of Russia.
The security alliance might be on the verge of expanding its membership.
Sweden and Finland appear close to abandoning their decades-old foreign
policy tradition of neutrality and entering NATO. Finland doing so would
add 810 miles to the border between Russia and NATO members. "If Sweden
and Finland join, NATO's presence and coordination in the Baltic Sea
area, as well as more broadly in the Nordic and Arctic, will be
strengthened, together with NATO's defense and deterrence posture," said
Chihaia. "Their armed forces would be an asset to the alliance as both
Sweden and Finland have been close partners for years, they have
invested in modernizing their armed forces, and there is a high degree
of interoperability and adherence to NATO standards." This deeply alarms
Moscow, which has been warning Stockholm and Helsinki about political
and military consequences. "Russia has threatened to place nuclear
weapons in its Kaliningrad enclave if Finland or Sweden join," explained
Feffer. "\[Russia\] has threatened to increase its military presence in
the Baltic region to deal with NATO's extended border with Russia if
Finland joins. But I'm not sure that the security architecture will
change that much. Sweden and Finland are not members of NATO, but they
have coordinated with the security alliance for some time. Russia,
meanwhile, has reportedly already placed nuclear weapons in Kaliningrad
(according to the Lithuanian government). But it does mean that the
space for neutrality in Europe is shrinking," Feffer added. The Orban
and Le Pen Factors [There are some limits to NATO's unity, which brings
us to Hungary]{.underline}. With Prime Minister Viktor Orban at the
helm, [Hungary is the Western alliance's most Russia-friendly
member]{.underline}. In the past, he has hailed Russia as a model for
his "illiberal" country. Although Budapest did not veto EU sanctions on
Moscow following Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, Orban
has vowed to block EU sanctions on oil and gas from Russia. The
Hungarian leader has also opposed demands to halt the expansion of the
Rosatom-financed Paks Nuclear Plant. As the leadership in Budapest sees
it, Hungarian citizens should not be burdened by costlier bills because
of energy sanctions against Russia. "Hungary is the problem child of
Europe because of the ties \[that Russia maintains with\] the Orban
government. As long as \[Orban\] is there, Budapest will be a problem,"
Dr Theodore Karasik, the former Senior Political Scientist in the
International Policy and Security Group at RAND Corporation, told
Politics Today. Nonetheless, Budapest is not defending Russia's
violations of Ukrainian sovereignty. "It's important to note that Orban
is not siding with Russia here," as Feffer pointed out. "He has
condemned the invasion." Orban believes that he has the diplomatic
abilities to navigate good relations with Moscow. Yet escalating
tensions between Hungary's fellow NATO members and Russia is testing
Orban's doctrine of "strategic calmness" vis-à-vis the Kremlin.
Depending on how the Russian-Ukrainian war pans out, Hungary could find
itself increasingly isolated within Europe. [There is also the question
of what happens to NATO if Marine Le Pen wins the second-round runoff in
France's presidential elections. Her victory would constitute a major
blow to the Western alliance,]{.underline} especially mindful of the
fact that Le Pen has signaled her support for France leaving NATO's
integrated military command as well as a strategic rapprochement between
the West and Moscow. Although this year Le Pen has condemned Russia's
violations of Ukraine's territorial dignity, Feffer described her as
"one of Putin's greatest cheerleaders in Western Europe" who "would
likely push to water down sanctions and reduce EU military support for
Ukraine" if she defeats Macron. "Le Pen is Russia's ace in the hole and
\[she\] needs to be watched and understood very carefully" considering
how her "connections to Moscow can stymie NATO policy actions by acting
as a major distraction," explained Dr Karasik. According to Chihaia, "if
Le Pen wins, EU defense initiatives will be negatively impacted and
there will be significant difficulties to move forward." He emphasized
that her victory could have major ramifications for Paris-Berlin
relations. "The Franco-German joint defense projects might be stopped.
The Franco-German 'engine' for developing European defense, essential in
moving forward with strengthening European defense capabilities and
structures, risks to be halted." Boxing in the Bear [**Regardless of how
Hungary and possibly France** will serve to undermine NATO unity,
**there is no denying that drastic shifts have taken place within the
security alliance**]{.underline} **s**ince 24 February. **[NATO finds
itself with a renewed purpose]{.underline}**. This bodes negatively for
Russia. Having viewed NATO's eastward expansion as a growing threat,
Moscow must contend with how [conditions in Ukraine are **tightening the
Transatlantic alliance** in truly remarkable ways]{.underline} which
were difficult to imagine only a few months ago. Putin's government is
in no position to easily or quickly reverse this move toward much deeper
coordination and solidarity among NATO's members. In Dr Karasik's words,
"[the mistakes by the Russians]{.underline} and the emergence of the Z
campaign [**are helping to unite NATO** in a way that's going to box in
Russia for decades."]{.underline}

### 2ac AT Turkey

#### NATO's [foundation]{.underline} allows consultations in order to [resolve]{.underline} disputes with Turkey, [not engage]{.underline} in them

)//RG

[Ultimately]{.underline}, however, [fears of a Turkish realignment with
Russia are]{.underline} likely [overblown. Moscow and Ankara's relations
have]{.underline} historically [been fraught, and the recent
rapprochement stems]{.underline} more [from opportunism]{.underline}
[and coinciding interests]{.underline} than a major reorientation in
Turkish foreign policy at the expense of its traditional alliances. In
fact, [Turkey's forceful posturing is making it]{.underline} steadily
[more at odds with Russia in conflict environments]{.underline} where
both operate, including Nagorno-Karabakh, Syria, and Libya. Its growing
involvement in the Caucasus, for instance, has brought it dangerously
close to armed confrontation with NATO's primary contestant, Russia,
which supports Armenia under the Collective Security Treaty Organization
framework. This was highlighted by Russian President Vladimir Putin's
underscoring of Russia's "obligations to Armenia." Though the violence
ended there, Turkey's proxy saber-rattling contributes to increase risks
of accident or miscalculation leading to armed confrontation with Russia
--- something all parties are eager to avoid. With antagonistic security
interests at stake, [Turkey and Russia are ultimately more likely to
balance against rather than align with each other,]{.underline} though
several NATO allies continue to regard Ankara's ties to Moscow with a
deep-seated sense of suspicion. A Constructive Role for NATO [As Turkey
and the E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [ramp up their
rhetorical joust, it is]{.underline} perhaps [no surprise that **NATO is
better placed to act as a forum for the de-escalation of the crisis**.
It is]{.underline} indeed [Turkey's membership to NATO]{.underline}, and
the daily staff-to-staff contacts which it generates, [that makes the
alliance able to work as a platform where]{.underline} their [diplomats
can negotiate, exchange information, and address issues]{.underline} of
common strategic interest with European counterparts, [thus helping to
undermine the "us-versus-them" mentality]{.underline} which at times
prevails across E.U. institutions. [As the latter hardens its rhetoric,
**NATO can generate the much-needed safety valve where diplomatic
efforts have a chance of succeeding.**]{.underline} To this end, [the
alliance should capitalize on the consultative function of its
institutions to allow for parties to sit together, express their views
and concerns]{.underline} on national and collective security
considerations, [and improve mechanisms to reach a
consensus]{.underline} on the means to address any perceived challenges.
[Consultations]{.underline} have indeed always been at the core of the
alliance, and [remain important vectors for addressing intermember
disagreements]{.underline}. The [recent announcement]{.underline}
[by]{.underline} NATO Secretary General Jens [Stoltenberg that
a]{.underline} military [de-confliction mechanism would be established
between Greece and Turkey is]{.underline} but [one example of the
productive results that such diplomatic efforts]{.underline} can [yield,
and an encouraging sign that the two sides are not willing to see their
relations deteriorate further.]{.underline} Yet a limited arrangement
between Greece and Turkey is also unlikely to address the deep-seated
causes of the political turmoil between Ankara and European allies, and
[NATO should find new and improved ways to act as a forum to discuss,
and]{.underline} to [act]{.underline}, where necessary, [on issues
affecting the security interests of its member states. This is key if
the organization wants to remain flexible and relevant in the

[policymakers]{.underline} within the US government and Turkey's
civilian and military establishment **[point to]{.underline}** perhaps
[**better days to come**, given the resilience and endurance of the
**ties that bind the two nations together**. The US perspective on
Turkey could be traced to many factors, starting with]{.underline} the
[refusal of]{.underline} the [Turkish Parliament to allow US forces to
transit Turkish territory to attack Iraq]{.underline} in 2003 and the
slow Turkish support for the US-led coalition against ISIS. [Turkey
is]{.underline} also [being put on notice by the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [for feuding against other NATO
allies]{.underline}---namely, Germany, the Netherlands, Cyprus, France,
and Greece. In the last case, tensio[ns have been brewing in recent
months over]{.underline} new [border disputes in]{.underline} the Aegean
and the refusal of [Greece]{.underline} to extradite a group of Turkish
officers allegedly involved in the failed coup. Although resolving the
Cyprus issue remains high on the US agenda, [tensions between Turkey and
Cyprus over oil and gas exploration rights and access]{.underline} off
the coast of Cyprus [are forcing the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and the European Union to side with Cyprus and even
entertain sending US naval ships to protect Cypriot gas and oil tracks
at sea. [Despite these and other policy differences]{.underline} over
Syria and other domestic problems facing Turkey, [**both sides seem
reluctant to cause irreparable damage to their alliance**. The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, which [has traditional ties
with Turkey, does not want a military confrontation]{.underline} with
the country over Syria. The most hopeful sign of addressing some of the
protracted problems currently facing US-Turkish relations stems from the
fact that [Turkey is still seen by the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [as important to America's national
security]{.underline} interests, especially [given Turkey's]{.underline}
geostrategic [location and]{.underline} cultural [familiarity with its
volatile neighbors. Turkey]{.underline} is currently self-absorbed with
its ambitions and Muslim neo-Ottoman nationalist revivalism, but its
unique ballot-box democracy, albeit imperfect by Western standards,
**[will work toward increasing harmonization toward the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and its NATO allies in
the long run. This can only happen through a sustained strategic
dialogue.]{.underline}** The idea is to keep Turkey and the United
States engaged while trying to find solutions to the issues that
separate them, because once the current tactical posturing is stripped
away, the strategic alliance becomes more visible. [There
is]{.underline} indeed current [evidence for better US-NATO-Turkish
cross-cultural communication techniques to manage and
resolve]{.underline} outstanding [policy and strategic
differences.]{.underline} In short, [**Turkey is not yet lost**, but
there are challenges]{.underline} facing America and its NATO partners
in how to bridge the growing gap between them and Turkey. This challenge
touches on a fundamental question: What kind of strategic relation- ship
do the United States, NATO, and Turkey want or desire? Clearly, [they
are at a]{.underline} policy and strategic [cross- road.]{.underline}
The answer lies in the need for the United States to craft a new
strategy toward Turkey and vice versa that takes into account the new
realities of Turkish, NATO, and American domestic political dynamics,
their changing nature and character, as well as Tur- key's quest for
regional influence and ambitions and its goal of becoming a great
regional power. **[Turkey, NATO, and the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [**share Western values, and** **these
values**,]{.underline} although not equal for all partners, **[are keys
to better multicultural harmony if applied properly]{.underline}**
across the board.

[Despite]{.underline} the [considerable]{.underline} degree of
[divergence, Ankara acts in parallel but not]{.underline} necessarily
[against the EU and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. In the
grand scheme of things, [Turkey is tightly connected to the European
economy]{.underline}, a fact highlighted by the ongoing recession, which
puts at risk EU investors too. [Turkish trade with EU
members]{.underline} Romania, Greece and Bulgaria [is]{.underline} by
far more [significant]{.underline} than with the Western Balkans, though
Serbia is picking up too. On the security side, [Turkey pursues a policy
independently of NATO]{.underline} and has deepened ties to Russia.
**[Yet, it remains part of the Alliance and contributes to its
initiatives, including those aimed to deter Moscow.]{.underline}** When
it comes to the Balkans, [Turkey]{.underline} has no alternative to
offer to local countries to woo them away from Euro- Atlantic
institutions. Its [resources are limited]{.underline}, too, [in
comparison]{.underline} [with the]{.underline} collective
[West]{.underline}. What is also important is that Balkan elites do not
necessarily see a trade-off between ties to Western organizations and to
Turkey. That is clearly visible in the policy of non-aligned Serbia,
which has also been courting Russia, China and the Gulf while
negotiating its membership in the EU. But it is also the case of
Bulgaria which has emerged as a leading advocate of engagement with
Turkey within the Union. [The only country]{.underline} in Southeast
Europe [which has deep-seated concerns]{.underline} and fears [about
Turkish expansionism is Greece,]{.underline} which has long-standing
territorial disputes with its neighbour only made worse by the looming
conflict over offshore gas deposits in the proximity of Cyprus. [But
Greek policymakers have demonstrated the capacity to be flexible and
deescalate tensions]{.underline} (Christofis in this issue). [Turkey is
embedded in the politics, economies and societies of the
Balkans]{.underline}. It is an autonomous player, and the cult of
Erdoğan has become central to its presence in the region, often with
divisive effects. [However, **there is no evidence that its actions or
policies are geared at replacing the West** as the lynchpin of regional
order. Rather, **Turkey is pursuing a parallel policy,
which**]{.underline} at times **[overlaps with that of
the]{.underline}** EU, **[US and NATO.]{.underline}**

In the recent decade, [the U.S. has pursued a strategy to
support]{.underline} armed [Kurdish groups]{.underline} to repel radical
Islamic terror groups, particularly ISIS. [Nevertheless, Turkey has
become increasingly concerned]{.underline} about the strengthening of
the Kurdish administration and its nationalist ambitions. [These
concerns are pushing Turkey into the arms of U.S. rivals]{.underline} in
the region. Both Iran and Russia are expanding their authority in the
region by establishing political and military support for radical
regimes such as Assad's in Syria and political and militant movements
like Hezbollah. These s[trategic policies are increasingly connecting
Iran's and Russia's allies in an ever-strengthening regional security
complex]{.underline}. Given these regional circumstances, [Turkey finds
itself flip-flopping between these rival regional security
complexes.]{.underline} The primary cause for current problems in
U.S.-Turkey relations is not simply the recent actions of the two
countries. The complex view of the IR system facilitates the
understanding that the [U.S.-Turkey relationship is shaped by the
feedback loops generated under]{.underline} both [regional and global
circumstances. The complexity of the international system can
trigger]{.underline} a dramatically [different evolution of relations
between U.S. and Turkey as a feedback (reaction]{.underline}) caused by
the U.S. For example, the U.S. does not hesitate to use methods like
arming the YPG, even if these methods hurt former allies such as Turkey.
As a result[, U.S.-Turkish relations continue to be vulnerable to the
U.S. approach toward]{.underline} minority, [rebel groups which have
problematic bonds with Turkey.]{.underline} The [international roles
that the U.S. and Turkey pursued]{.underline} for themselves in the
post-9/11 era have [had consequences for perceptions of]{.underline}
historical [friendship or hostilities]{.underline} -- what the Regional
Security Complex Theory ties to cooperative or non-cooperative behavior
of states. [There were hostility perceptions among Turkish]{.underline}
military and Foreign Service [chiefs in the wake of the collapse of the
Soviet Union]{.underline} when the U.S. sought to maintain its global
supremacy role. Given its resources, the [U.S. cannot help but be
superior to smaller,]{.underline} poorer [states that do not have
Washington's military capacity. The issue is the way]{.underline} in
which [the U.S. dominates]{.underline} -- that is, [its treatment of its
allies, not considering their strategic]{.underline} security
[concerns]{.underline}, etc. Turkey was deeply concerned with events in
northern Iraq following the 1991 Iraq war. These events amounted to
challenge Turkey's priority of preventing the emergence of an
independent Kurdish administration in northern Iraq. [The hostility
perceptions in Turkey turned to be reciprocal between the U.S. and
Turkey]{.underline} thanks to the feedback loops generated by the 9/11
attacks. The unilateral U.S. reaction to the 9/11 attacks during the
Bush administration undermined the U.S.-led liberal international order
and played no small role in the inauguration of Trump as a president who
questions this order and views local U.S. allies as burdens on the U.S.
[If we acknowledge that the complexity of the i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elations [system is at play]{.underline} here, the causal
logic of the [complexity approach leads us to expect that Turkey's
internal characteristics can pressure systemic
transformation]{.underline} -- something other than the predictions
generated by the regional security complex approach.83 [A U.S. that
operates with a systemic moral conscience could assist Turkey in
managing its affairs. Facing complexity **invokes improving diplomacy
and collaboration, adopting multilateral solutions**]{.underline} and
soft power **[and constructing]{.underline}** some [**advanced strategic
partnerships**. If the U.S. chooses to nurture its relationships with
allies such as Turkey, the erosion of the U.S.]{.underline} position of
[influence could be mitigated]{.underline} and the U.S. still could be
the primary actor in maintaining stability in the Middle East. The
underlying message of this paper is that [**the U.S. and Turkey are
rebuilding their alliance due to various factors.** Both **countries
could form a revised alliance as an important constituent of the
regional peace system.** Neither]{.underline} of them
[desire]{.underline}s the [continuation of the]{.underline} Syrian
[chaotic status-quo and its accompanying insecurity]{.underline} nor do
they desire Iran to dominate with a greater role in Syria or in the
Middle East. Clearly, [the security of the region is in]{.underline} a
state of greater [flux]{.underline} today than it has been in the past,
yet **[tackling the present challenges]{.underline}** in the Middle East
**[depends on the effective involvement of regional U.S.
partners.]{.underline}**

[The]{.underline} end [result of Turkey's tarnished ties with
its]{.underline} traditional [allies in the West]{.underline} and its
neighborhood(s) [have demonstrated the limits of the illusion of
Ankara's strategic autonomy.]{.underline} Indeed, despite its
aspiration, **[Turkey remains firmly anchored in the Western community
of nations.]{.underline}** In addition to being a NATO member, over 40
percent of [the country's exports are destined for EU member states
and]{.underline} another 6 percent or so each to [the UK
and]{.underline} the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. In
addition, [Turkey gets]{.underline} most of [its]{.underline} foreign
direct investment ([FDI) and tech]{.underline}nology [from Western
countries]{.underline}. EU member states account for almost 70 percent
of all incoming FDI, with another nearly 10 per- cent accounted by the
United States. Against this backdrop, the 2020 economic downturn,
compounded by a sharp drop in FDI, a negative foreign investment balance
sheet (excluding real estate), and a lowering of credit risk
scores---and, more recently, a spike in inflation and a downturn in the
value of the national currency---are to be associated with these frail
political relations. [The next phase of Turkey's foreign relations
paradigm will]{.underline} therefore [be marked **by how well the
country's growing capabilities**]{.underline}---but also its
ambitions---**[can be reframed to allow for]{.underline} a [more
cooperative foreign policy]{.underline}** pattern. [This]{.underline}
objective [will]{.underline} in turn [require three
fundamental]{.underline} [changes]{.underline}. [The first is the
decoupling of foreign policy from domestic political considerations. A
new balance will have to be found between the need for a democratic
government]{.underline} that is accountable to its electorate
[and]{.underline} the need for a more [mature]{.underline} and
predictable [foreign policy.]{.underline} This new understanding should
be instrumental in containing the proclivities of the ruling elites to
instrumentalize foreign policy for domestic goals. This objective will
be greatly facilitated by a [second]{.underline}, namely [the
reinstitutionalization of foreign policy.]{.underline} As discussed
above, [the transition back to a presidential system has led to the
erosion]{.underline} of the role [of traditional
institutions]{.underline} (e.g., ministries) in the policymaking
process---to the benefit of the presidential administration. This is
also true of foreign policy, where the role of the Foreign Ministry has
been diminished. [This]{.underline} domain [requires re- balancing,
which would reempower]{.underline} the [traditional]{.underline}
institution of [policymaking]{.underline}. Such [a rebalancing would
improve the predictability of Turkey's foreign policy]{.underline}, as
the heavier weight of the relevant institutions could more effectively
counter the tendencies fueled by exclusively domestic political
considerations. Third, [the country's foreign policy retransformation
will be more effective if Turkey's partners respond positively to
such]{.underline} an agenda of [change. The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and the EU---Turkey's strategic allies in the
domains of security, defense, and economy---[can help
Ankara]{.underline} in its bid to [develop a new understanding of how
Turkey]{.underline}, as a rising power, [can prioritize positive sum
scenarios]{.underline}. For instance, [**Washington will need to** alter
its approach and **start to engage constructively with the Turkish
leadership to tackle**]{.underline} the corrosive set of **[bilateral
problems,]{.underline}** including the ongoing U.S. relationship with
the PKK-linked Syrian PYD and the dysfunctionalities in defense industry
cooperation. At the same time, the EU will need---at the very least---to
cease its obstructionism regarding the launch of an ambitious trade
agenda and endorse the start of the negotiations for a modernized
Customs Union between Turkey and the EU. [The outcome of new
negotiations to reach a fair and lasting model of
cooperation]{.underline} on the refugee issue [will be of equal
importance.]{.underline} At bottom, [what is at stake in the next decade
is the identity of Turkish foreign policy. **A departure
from**]{.underline} what marked the past decade---[**unilateralism**
inspired by]{.underline} a strong yearning for [strategic
autonomy]{.underline}---[**is already under way**. **This change in
approach is evident in**]{.underline} the more **[recent efforts at
diplomatic rapprochement with allies and regional
partners]{.underline}**. Ultimately, [the success of this transformation
will be conditional on a clear demonstration]{.underline} of intent by
the country's leadership [that **Turkey**]{.underline}, as a rising
power, **[needs to establish a more constructive and cooperative
relationship with its main allies.]{.underline}**

It turns out [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[neither]{.mark} brain
[dead nor broken]{.mark}]{.underline}. The unprovoked **[Russian
invasion of [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}** has
[[given]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[alliance]{.mark} a **[new]{.mark}
lease on [life]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[making it more]{.mark}
**politically [united]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **militarily
[formidable]{.mark}** [than at any time]{.mark}]{.underline} since the
end of the Cold War.

NATO stands as one against Russian barbarism in Ukraine. Even
[[Germany]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[boosting]{.underline}]{.mark} its
anemic **[defense [spending]{.mark}]{.underline}** and finally sending
heavy weaponry to Ukraine. Other states are doing far more, with the
[**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline},
[[Poland]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Canada]{.underline}]{.mark} and
[[Britain]{.underline}]{.mark} leading the way in [providing arms and
ammunition]{.underline}. [NATO]{.underline} is
[[doubling]{.underline}]{.mark} the number of
[battalion-size]{.underline} "**[[battlegroups]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
[deployed to]{.underline} the front-line states of [Eastern
Europe]{.underline}, from four to eight, while the United States has
increased its troop deployment in Europe from 80,000 to 100,000
personnel.

Now even [[Sweden and Finland]{.underline}]{.mark}, [which]{.underline}
have [long maintained]{.underline} their [neutrality]{.underline}, are
[**declaring their desire** to [join the alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}.
They are [**almost certain** to be admitted]{.underline}, despite
Turkish reservations and predictable hand-wringing from
pseudo-"realists" about provoking the Russian bear.

With Sweden and Finland as members, [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} will
[[hit the]{.mark} **strategic [jackpot]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Admitting
them to NATO isn't an act of charity. They are formidable military
powers in their own right that can substantially contribute to deterring
further Russian aggression.

Yet [as the crisis evolves, decisions about how to support Ukraine will
become more difficult]{.underline}, and there's a limit to how unified
NATO can be. While the West might agree on introducing tough new
economic sanctions and reinforcing the Alliance's eastern flank,
[boosting Kyiv's military capacity]{.underline}---by supporting an
insurgency, for instance, or sending anti-tank weapons---[will be
impossible to achieve by consensus and is]{.underline} much [more likely
to come from individual members than under NATO]{.underline} auspices.
[This shouldn't be surprising.]{.underline} Consider Russia's annexation
of Crimea in 2014 and its ongoing support for separatists in Ukraine's
Donbas region: [NATO actions in support of Kyiv have been]{.underline}
more [political]{.underline} than operational, [leaving it to individual
allies to provide munitions, equipment, and training to Ukrainian
forces.]{.underline} And despite a recurrent pledge that Ukraine would
one day be welcome to join the Alliance, as well as the sympathy
expressed by allies for Ukraine's plight, there's been precious little
progress on this front. NATO is primarily concerned about defending its
members from Russian aggression---which it is also wary of provoking by
supporting the Ukrainian military. Yet [despite its lack of
meaningful]{.underline} military [support for Ukraine, the crisis has
been the animating issue on the]{.underline} Alliance's [agenda since
2014. Russia's attacks]{.underline} on Ukraine and its support for
separatists [have driven major NATO initiatives]{.underline} on
readiness, defense planning, force posture, intelligence, and technology
development, with an eye toward beefing up the Alliance's northern and
eastern flanks and deterring Russia in both the conventional and
sub-threshold realms. As an institution established to safeguard Europe,
[it has]{.underline} successfully [geared itself to deter]{.underline}
the type of [destabilizing Russian belligerence]{.underline} currently
on display. [Critics]{.underline} of the alliance (and even some
supporters) [have interpreted NATO's unwillingness to militarily support
Ukraine]{.underline}---especially during the most significant challenge
to the European security order since the Cold War---[as an indicator of
its declining relevance, timidity, or its divisions. But that
**overstates the importance of political consensus** to NATO's value and
**understates its role as an effective**]{.underline} and flexible
[**defensive alliance**.]{.underline} This is a role with potentially
critical benefits for Ukraine. [First, it sets too high a bar for an
alliance of thirty members with aligned, but distinct, priorities.
Unanimity on every issue is impossible]{.underline}, let alone one as
complex as military support to Ukraine. Debate and
**[disagreement]{.underline}**, as it should be for any democratic
institution, **[are built-in features of NATO---not bugs]{.underline}**.
In reality, it's astounding how often NATO does reach consensus about
issues big and small, creating an unrealistic expectation that it always
will. [The opposite of consensus is not failure. Suggesting otherwise
turns any debate that doesn't end harmoniously into an indictment of
NATO]{.underline}, playing straight into Russian propaganda. [Second, a
belief that NATO's value is tied]{.underline} primarily [to achieving
consensus on every issue misses the more]{.underline} mundane (and
[important) ways it supports its allies]{.underline} and partners. [Its
affinity for process]{.underline}---particularly its ability to build a
common situational understanding among its members---[is]{.underline} an
[invaluable]{.underline} tool. Habits of [consultation and information
sharing]{.underline}, buttressed by deep cooperation on operations,
intelligence sharing, defense planning, and interoperability, [create
the foundation upon]{.underline} which any [consensus]{.underline} is to
be built. **[Even in the absence of that agreement, the ability to
collectively define threats and]{.underline}** jointly train to
**[confront them is immensely valuable]{.underline}** in its own right.
Third, [these **habits of cooperation give NATO members**]{.underline}
the [**flexibility to act outside of the Alliance**'s
frameworks.]{.underline} While NATO does much by consensus---such as its
missions in the Baltic states---[the skills it helps members develop is
central to enabling them to form separate coalitions for
action.]{.underline} This happened recently with ample success in taking
on the Islamic State. [Such flexibility should be a point in NATO's
favor, not evidence of its ineptitude.]{.underline} In the case of
military support for Ukraine, [policymakers will find more attractive
alternatives for dealing with Moscow's aggression outside of
the]{.underline} auspices of the [Alliance]{.underline}. Up to and
including its recent dialogue with Russia, [it has taken a host of
consensus actions to support Ukraine]{.underline}---from condemning
Kremlin aggression and standing up for Kyiv politically to reaffirming
its open-door policy with an expectation that Ukraine will eventually
become a member. It might even share intelligence and develop training
and advisory programs for the Ukrainian military. [And while it won't
find a consensus to fight, it could provide the foundation
for]{.underline} certain [allies to support Ukrainian forces in ways
consistent with their national priorities outside of NATO]{.underline}.
In that case, [NATO's enabling value to its members in complicating
Putin's]{.underline} cost-benefit [assessment should be
applauded.]{.underline} Last week's NATO-Russia Council meeting
showcased an Alliance working in lockstep and finding political
consensus in responding to preposterous Russian demands. [NATO should
always strive for]{.underline} this degree of [consensus]{.underline}.
[But]{.underline} if and [when this crisis intensifies]{.underline}, and
Putin advances further into Ukraine, expectations for NATO assistance
will be raised, decisions about how to respond will become more
difficult, and [consensus will be more elusive. Despite the rhetoric
we]{.underline} might [hear in response, **this is not evidence of
NATO's ineffectiveness**]{.underline}---[but rather a reflection of how
democratic institutions function.]{.underline} And **[even absent
consensus, NATO can still contribute invaluably to Ukraine's
sovereignty.]{.underline}**

most significant challenge to the European security order since the Cold
War---[[as an indicator of]{.mark} its [declining relevance]{.mark},
timidity, or its divisions. [But that **overstates the importance
of**]{.mark} **political [consensus]{.mark} to NATO's value** and
**understates its role as an effective and flexible defensive
alliance**. This is a role with potentially critical benefits for
Ukraine.]{.underline}

First, it sets too high a bar for an alliance of thirty members with
aligned, but distinct, priorities. [[Unanimity on every issue is
impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}, let alone one as complex as military
support to Ukraine. [[Debate and disagreement]{.mark}, as it should be
[for any democratic institution, are **built-in**]{.mark} **features of
NATO---[not bugs]{.mark}.** In reality, it's astounding how often NATO
does reach consensus about issues big and small, creating an unrealistic
expectation that it always will.]{.underline} [The **opposite of
consensus is not failure**. Suggesting otherwise turns any debate that
doesn't end harmoniously into an indictment of NATO, playing straight
into Russian propaganda.]{.underline}

Second, [a belief that NATO's value is tied primarily to achieving
consensus on every issue misses the more mundane (and important) ways it
supports its allies and partners. Its affinity for
process---particularly its ability to build a common situational
understanding among its members---is an invaluable tool.]{.underline}
[Habits of consultation and information sharing, buttressed by deep
cooperation on operations, intelligence sharing, defense planning, and
interoperability, create the foundation upon which any consensus is to
be built. **[Even in the absence of]{.mark}** that **[agreement, the
ability to collectively define threats]{.mark}** and jointly train to
confront them **[is immensely valuable]{.mark} in its own
right**.]{.underline}

Third, [these [habits of coop]{.mark}eration [give]{.mark} NATO
[members]{.mark} the [flexibility to act outside of the
Alliance]{.mark}'s frameworks. While NATO does much by consensus---such
as its missions in the Baltic states---the skills it helps members
develop is central to enabling them to form separate coalitions for
action. [This]{.mark} [happened]{.mark} recently [with]{.mark} ample
success in [taking on the Islamic State]{.mark}.]{.underline} Such
[**flexibility should be a point in NATO's favor, not evidence of its
ineptitude**.]{.underline}

In the case of military support for Ukraine, policymakers will find more
attractive alternatives for dealing with Moscow's aggression outside of
the auspices of [[the Alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}. Up to and including
its recent dialogue with Russia, it [has [taken a host of consensus
actions to support Ukraine]{.mark}---from condemning Kremlin aggression
and standing up for Kyiv politically to reaffirming its open-door policy
with an expectation that Ukraine will eventually become a member. It
might even share intelligence and develop training and advisory programs
for the Ukrainian military.]{.underline}

[And while it won't find a consensus to fight, it could [provide the
foundation for]{.mark} certain [allies to support Ukrain]{.mark}ian
forces]{.underline} in ways consistent with their national priorities
outside of NATO. In that case, [NATO's enabling value to its members in
[complicating Putin's cost-benefit assessment]{.mark} should be
applauded.]{.underline}

[Last week's NATO-Russia Council meeting showcased an Alliance working
in lockstep and finding political consensus]{.underline} in responding
to preposterous Russian demands. [NATO should always strive for this
degree of consensus. But if and when this crisis
intensifies]{.underline}, and Putin advances further into Ukraine,
[expectations for NATO assistance will be raised, decisions about how to
respond will become more difficult, and consensus will be more
elusive.]{.underline}

[Despite the rhetoric we might hear in response, this is not evidence of
NATO's ineffectiveness---but rather a reflection of how democratic
institutions function. And even absent consensus, NATO can still
contribute invaluably to Ukraine's sovereignty.]{.underline}

### 2ac AT Coop Fails -- AI -- Data

#### GDPR does NOT preclude AI -- standards are vague enough to allow AI without real limits

**EPRS 20** - European Parliamentary Research Service. ("The impact of
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on artificial
intelligence," Panel for the Future of Science and Technology, June
2020,
<https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2020/641530/EPRS_STU(2020)641530_EN.pdf>
) PJW

**[[AI is compatible with]{.mark} the [GDPR]{.mark}]{.underline}** AI is
not explicitly mentioned in the GPDR, but many provisions in the GDPR
are relevant to AI, and some are indeed challenged by the new ways of
processing personal data that are enabled by AI. [There is]{.underline}
indeed [a tension between the traditional data protection
principles]{.underline} -- purpose limitation, data minimisation, the
special treatment of \'sensitive data\', the limitation on automated
decisions-- [and the full deployment of the power of AI and big data.
The latter entails the collection of vast quantities of data concerning
individuals and their social relations and processing such data for
purposes that were not fully determined at the time of collection.
However, [there are ways to interpret]{.mark}, apply, and develop the
data protection [principles]{.mark} that are [consistent with]{.mark}
the beneficial [uses of AI and big data]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
requirement of purpose limitation can be understood in a way that is
compatible with AI and big data, through a [flexible application of the
idea of compatibility]{.underline}, which [[allows]{.mark} for the
[reuse of personal data]{.mark} when this is not incompatible with the
purposes for which the data were originally collected.]{.underline}
Moreover, [reuse for statistical purposes is assumed to be compatible,
and thus would]{.underline} in general [be admissible]{.underline}
(unless it involves unacceptable risks for the data subject). [The
principle of data minimisation can also be understood in such a way as
to allow for]{.underline} beneficial applications of [AI.]{.underline}
Minimisation may require, in some contexts, reducing the \'personality\'
of the available data,rather than the amount of such data, i.e., it may
require reducing, through measures such as pseudonymisation, the ease
with which the data can be connected to individuals. The possibility of
re-identification should not entail that all re-identifiable data are
considered personal data to be minimised. Ratherthe re-identification of
data subjectsshould be considered as creation of new personal data,
which should be subject to all applicable rules. Re-identification
should indeed be strictly prohibited unless all conditions for the
lawful collection of personal data are met, and it should be compatible
with the purposes for which the data were originally collected and
subsequently anonymised. [The information requirements established by
the GDPR can be met with regard to AI-based processing, even though the
complexity of AI application has to be taken into account.]{.underline}
The information made available to data subjectsshould enable themto
understand the purpose of each AI-based processing and its limits, even
without going into unnecessary technical details. The GDPR allows for
inferences based on personal data, provided that appropriate safeguards
are adopted. [[Profiling is in principle prohibited, but there are ample
exceptions]{.mark} (contract, law or consent).]{.underline}
Uncertainties exist concerning the extent to which an individual
explanation should be provided to the data subject. It is also uncertain
to what extent reasonableness criteria may apply to automated decisions.
gconcerning [[privacy]{.mark} by design and by default, **[do not hinder
the development of AI]{.mark}** systems]{.underline}, if correctly
designed and implemented, even though they may entail some additional
costs. It needs to be clarified which AI applications present high risks
and therefore require a preventive data protection assessment, and
possibly the preventive involvement of data protection authorities.
Finally, the possibility of using personal data for statistical purposes
opens opportunities for the processing of personal data in ways that do
not involve the inference of new personal data. Statistical processing
requires security measures that are proportionate to the risks for the
data subject, and which should include at least pseudonymisation. The
GDPR prescriptions are often vague and open-ended [The GDPR allows for
the development of AI and big data applications]{.underline} that
successfully balance data protection and other social and economic
interests, but it provides limited guidance on how to achieve this goal.
It indeed abounds in vague clauses and open standards, the application
of which often requires balancing competing interests. In the case of
AI/big data applications, the uncertainties are aggravated by the
novelty of the technologies, their complexity and the broad scope of
their individual and social effects. It is true that the principles of
risk-prevention and accountability potentially direct the processing of
personal data toward a \'positive sum\' game, in which the advantages of
the processing, when constrained by appropriate risk-mitigation
measures, outweigh its possible disadvantages. Moreover these
[[principles enable experimentation and learning, avoiding]{.mark} the
over- and underinclusiveness issues involved in the applications of
[strict rules]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, by requiring controllers to
rely on such principles, the GDPR offloads the task of establishing how
to manage risk and find optimal solutions onto controllers, a task that
may be challenging as well as costly. The stiff penalties for
non-compliance, when combined with the uncertainty on the
requirementsfor compliance, may constitute a novel risk, which, rather
than incentivising the adoption of adequate compliance measure, may
prevent small companies from engaging in new ventures. Thus, the
successful application of GDPR to AI-application depends heavily on what
guidance data protection bodies and other competent authorities will
provide to controllers and data subjects. Appropriate guidance would
diminish the cost of legal uncertainty and would direct companies -- in
particular small ones that mostly need such advice -- to efficient and
data protection-compliant solutions. Some policy indications The study
concludes with the following indications on AI and the processing of
personal data. • The GDPR generally provides meaningful indications for
data protection in the context of AI applications. • [The GDPR can be
interpreted and applied in such a way that it does not substantially
hinder the application of AI to personal data]{.underline}, and that it
does not place EU companies at a disadvantage by comparison with
non-European competitors. • Thus, the [[GDPR does not require major
changes]{.mark} in order to address AI applications]{.underline}

#### Disputes indefinitely delay new European AI regs

Luca **Bertuzzi 22** - journalist and editor at EURACTIV, specialized in
EU affairs and digital policies. Luca covers AI, cybersecurity, data,
privacy and platform regulation. He oversees an international team based
in Brussels, Paris and Berlin. ("Inside the EU\'s rocky path to regulate
artificial intelligence," International Association of Privacy
Professionals, 02/09/2022,
<https://iapp.org/news/a/inside-the-eus-rocky-path-to-regulate-artificial-intelligence/>
) PJW

In April last year, the [[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}an Commission
[published]{.underline} its ambitious [[propos]{.mark}al [to regulate
A]{.mark}]{.underline}rtificial [[I]{.underline}]{.mark}ntelligence.
[The regulation was meant to be the first of its kind, but the progress
[has been slow]{.mark}]{.underline} so far [due to the file\'s
technical, political and juridical complexity.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, the EU lost its first-mover advantage as other jurisdictions
like China and Brazil have managed to pass their legislation first. As
the proposal is entering a crucial year, it is high time to take stock
of the state of play, the ongoing policy discussions, notably around
data, and potential implications for businesses.

State of play

For the European Parliament, [delays have been mainly [due to]{.mark}
more than [six months of]{.mark} political [disputes]{.mark} between
lawmakers over who was to take the lead in the file. The [result was a
co-lead]{.mark} between the centrists and the center-left]{.underline},
sidelining the conservative European People\'s Party.

Members of European Parliament are now trying to make up for lost time.
The first draft of the report is planned for April, with discussions on
amendments throughout the summer. [The intention is to]{.underline}
reach a compromise by September and [hold the final vote in
November.]{.underline}

[The timeline seems particularly ambitious since co-leads involve double
the number of people, **[inevitably slowing down the process]{.mark}**.
The question will be to what extent the co-rapporteurs will remain
aligned on the critical political issues as the [center-right will try
to lure]{.mark} the [liberals]{.mark} into more business-friendly
rules.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, [the EU Council made some [progress]{.mark} on the file,
however, [limited by]{.mark} its [highly technical
nature]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is telling that even national
governments, which have significantly more resources than MEPs, struggle
to understand the new rules\' full implications.

[Slovenia]{.underline}, which led the diplomatic talks for the second
half of 2021, [aimed to develop a compromise for 15 articles, but only
covered the first seven.]{.underline} With the beginning of the French
presidency in January, the file is expected to move faster as Paris aims
to provide a full compromise by April.

Hot topics

[As the policy discussions made some progress in the EU Council, several
**[sticking points emerged.]{.mark}** The very **[definition of
AI]{.mark} systems [is problematic]{.mark}**, as European governments
distinguish them from traditional software programs or statistical
methods.]{.underline}

[The diplomats also added a new category for \"general purpose\" AI,
such as synthetic data packages or language models. However, there is
still no clear understanding of whether the responsibility should be
attributed upstream, to the producer, or downstream, to the
provider.]{.underline}

[The use of real-time [biometric]{.mark} recognition system[s]{.mark}
has]{.underline} primarily [[monopolized]{.mark} the]{.underline} public
[[debate]{.mark}, as the commission\'s proposal falls short of a total
ban for some crucial exceptions, notably terrorist attacks and
kidnapping.]{.underline} In October, [[lawmakers]{.mark} adopted a
resolution [pushing for a]{.mark} complete [ban]{.mark}]{.underline},
echoing the argument made by civil society that these exceptions provide
a dangerous slippery slope.

By contrast, facial recognition technologies are increasingly common in
Europe. [A majority of member states wants to keep or even expand the
exceptions to border control, with Germany]{.underline} so far
[relatively isolated in calling for a total ban.]{.underline}

\"The European Commission did propose a set of criteria for updating the
list of high-risk applications. However, it did not provide a
justification for the existing list, which might mean that any update
might be extremely difficult to justify,\" Lilian Edwards, a professor
at Newcastle University, said.

Put differently, [[since]{.mark} the [reasoning behind]{.mark} the lists
of prohibited or high-risk [AI uses are]{.mark} largely [value-based,
they are **likely to remain heatedly debated**]{.mark} **points point
[through the whole]{.mark} legislative [process]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

For instance, [the Future of Life Institute has been arguing for a
broader definition of manipulation, which might profoundly impact the
advertising sector]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the way [online
platforms]{.underline} currently operate.

[A [**dividing line** that is likely to **emerge
systematically**]{.mark} in the debate [is]{.mark} the [tension
between]{.mark} the [innovation needs of]{.mark} the
[industry]{.mark},]{.underline} as some member states already stressed,
[[and ensuring consumer protection in]{.underline}]{.mark} the broadest
sense, including [the use of personal [data]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Data protection & AI

This underlying tension is best illustrated in the ongoing discussion
for the report of the parliamentary committee on Artificial Intelligence
in a Digital Age, which are progressing in parallel to the AI Act.

In his initial draft, conservative MEP Axel Voss attacked the General
Data Protection Regulation, presenting AI as part of a technological
race where Europe risks becoming China\'s \"economic colony\" if it did
not relax its privacy rules.

The report faced backlash from left-to-center policymakers, who saw it
as an attempt to water down the EU\'s hard-fought data protection law.
[For progressive]{.underline} MEP[s, data-hungry algorithms fed with
vast amounts of personal data might not be desirable, and they draw a
parallel with their activism in trying to curb personalized
advertising.]{.underline}

\"[Which algorithms do we train with vast amounts of personal
data?]{.underline} Likely [those that automatically]{.underline}
classify, [profile]{.underline} or identify [people based on their
personal details ---]{.underline} often [with huge consequences and
risks of discrimination or]{.underline} even [manipulation. Do we really
want to be using those, let alone \'leading\' their development?\" MEP
Kim van Sparrentak said.]{.underline}

### 2ac AT Soft Law Fails - AI

#### Soft law is the best form of ethical AI regulation

**Villasenor, 20** (John Villasenor, 7-31-2020, \"Soft law as a
complement to AI regulation,\" Brookings,
<https://www.brookings.edu/research/soft-law-as-a-complement-to-ai-regulation/>,
LASA-CSK)

While the [dialogue on [how to]{.mark} responsibly [foster a healthy AI
ecosystem should]{.mark} certainly [include]{.mark}
regulation]{.underline}, that shouldn't be the only tool in the toolbox.
[There should also be room for]{.underline} dialogue regarding the role
of "[[soft law]{.underline}."]{.mark} As Arizona State University law
professor Gary Marchant has explained, soft law refers to frameworks
that "set forth substantive expectations but are not directly
enforceable by government, and include approaches such as professional
guidelines, private standards, codes of conduct, and best practices."
Soft law isn't new. The authors of a 2018 article in the Colorado
Technology Law Journal point out that uses of soft law go back decades.
Examples they cite include the U.S. Green Building Council's 1993
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification
standards, the Food and Drug Administration's longstanding practice of
issuing non-binding guidance, and, in recent years, explanatory blog
posts and tweets from agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission and
Federal Communications Commission. There are other examples as well.
Bluetooth, the standard used for short-range wireless communication
between pairs of devices like laptops and wireless speakers, was
developed through a collaboration among technology companies. Wi-Fi, the
set of wireless local area networking (LAN) standards that allows us to
connect computers and many other devices to hotspots in homes and
offices, was developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE). The certification through the Wi-Fi Alliance, a
related soft law framework, ensures that products labeled with the Wi-Fi
Alliance logo have "met industry-agreed standards for interoperability,
security, and a range of application specific protocols." While [**[soft
law]{.mark}** has been applied in many fields]{.underline}, there are
multiple reasons why [it **[is particularly well suited for
AI]{.mark}**]{.underline}. First, as Marchant writes, "[[the pace of
development]{.mark} of AI far [exceeds]{.mark} the capability of [any
traditional regulatory system to keep up]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}"
[[Congressional legislation and agency]{.mark} administrative
[rulemaking operate on time scales]{.mark} [of
years]{.mark}]{.underline}. By contrast, [enormous private and public
sector investments have spurred rapid]{.underline} [AI
development]{.underline}. According to the National Venture Capital
Association, "1,356 AI-related companies in the U.S. raised \$18.457
billion" in 2019. A February 2020 report from the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) reported that, for the government's
2020 fiscal year, "unclassified, non-defense Federal investments in AI
R&D, total\[ed\] \$973.5 million." Research funded by the Department of
Defense includes DARPA's \$2 billion "AI Next" campaign, which was
announced in late 2018. With those levels of investment, [the
[AI]{.mark} technology landscape [is changing by the
mont]{.mark}]{.underline}[h]{.mark}. [This rate]{.underline} of
development [is ill suited for time scales involved in administrative
law]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} often [takes more than a year to
go from a proposed rule to a final rule.]{.underline} A second reason
soft law is suitable for AI is the sheer complexity of the landscape[.
[It would make no sense]{.mark}---[financially, logistically]{.mark}, or
in terms of staffing---to task one or more government agencies with the
rulemaking and oversight extensive enough to cover]{.underline} all of
the many [applications and industries where AI will be
used]{.underline}. For a small subset of applications, such as
autonomous vehicles where the potential harms caused by failures are
particularly acute, government regulation will play an important role.
But most uses of AI aren't nearly so high stakes. For those
applications, **[[soft l]{.mark}aw]{.underline}** developed with input
from companies, civil society groups, academic experts, and governments
**[[will]{.mark} be a key method to [promote innovation consistent with
ethical]{.mark} frameworks and [principles]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Paris, France, September 30, 2021 - Advent [France Biotechnology (AFB),
an AMF-regulated investment company dedicated to life sciences, today
announces the first closing of its second fund for a total of €86M
(\$102M]{.underline}). The European Investment Fund (EIF) and the Fonds
national d\'amorçage 2 (the French Seed Fund 2) [managed on behalf of
the French State by Bpifrance, participated in the fund, along with
corporate ventures including Boehringer Ingelheim Venture Fund, Pierre
Fabre and a major Asian pharmaceutical company, family offices and
AFB\'s management.]{.underline} This new fund, dedicated to early-stage
investments in European life [sciences companies with a focus on France,
will build on the successful investment strategy of AFB\'s first fund,
launched in 2017]{.underline} - which resulted in the creation and/or
funding of 15 startups. Among these, the creation of Gamut Therapeutics,
merged in less than a year with leading gene therapy company
SparingVision, the initial funding of Agomab, which has recently raised
its Series B \$74M (€61.5M) funding with major US crossover investors,
and the creation of several startups developing best- or first-in-class
therapeutics in oncology and immunology. [As of today 14 of the 15
portfolio companies in AFB\'s first fund are financed in syndication.
AFB will continue to work closely with leading European research
institutions and their technology transfer offices, as well as with
European venture capital partners, to select and back entrepreneurs and
early-stage companies with the potential to deliver first- or
best-in-class therapeutics.]{.underline} AFB will predominantly invest
in Europe, with a focus on France, Spain and Belgium. The fund plans to
select and finance two startups before the end of this year. \"We firmly
believe that early-stage financing is critical for the life sciences
industry, where the needs are huge and still not met, especially in
France,\" said Alain Huriez, MD, chairman and managing partner, AFB.
\"[This second fund shows the relevance of our positioning as
entrepreneur-investors in life sciences, confirmed by the renewed
support of our limited partners. Our scientific ecosystem is rich with
high-profile scientists and endless potential for breakthrough
innovations, endorsed by the numerous emerging life sciences startups in
Europe and the latest international deals in the
industry.\"]{.underline} \"The European Investment Fund is delighted to
renew its support in a promising seed investor in the French life
sciences market, which remains undercapitalized despite its significant
potential,\" said Alain Godard, EIF chief executive. \"Thanks to the
European guarantee fund, this new Advent France Biotechnology fund was
able to reach its target size in a particularly challenging fundraising
environment.\" Nicolas Dufourcq, CEO of Bpifrance, added: \"Our
investment, via the French Seed Fund 2 (FNA 2), in Advent France
Biotechnology\'s second fund illustrates perfectly the strategy we have
been implementing together for the past ten years: to support ambitious
teams in order to encourage the emergence of startups from French
research. [With this new fund, and all the other actions deployed by the
Future Investment Program (PIA) and Bpifrance, we want to provide
entrepreneurs with the necessary resources to develop the innovative
therapies of the future.\"]{.underline} In Europe there is a critical
need to develop further early-stage funding in similar proportion to
that invested in the US. AFB has built a strong team of experts to help
fill this gap. This strategy enables the early identification of
promising therapeutic innovations and kickstarts startups hand-in-hand
with scientific founders and academic institutions.

#### France easing up on GMOs

**Schofield 6-1** (Ian Schofield, BA in Modern Language -- French and

The French medicines agency, **[ANSM, has implemented a new, simplified
procedure]{.underline}** for medicines **[containing genetically
modified organisms]{.underline}**, including gene therapies and certain
vaccines, that are to be tested in clinical trials or made available
under early access protocols. As of 1 June, **[all applications for the
\"contained use\" of GMO-containing products in clinical trials must be
made to ANSM]{.underline}**, as must requests for \"deliberate release\"
of such products in the context of early and compassionate access to
advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) prepared on an ad hoc basis
for gene therapy. Under EU rules, the individual member states are
responsible for authorizing clinical trials of investigational medicinal
products containing or consisting of GMOs, which must comply with the EU
legislation on the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment or
their contained use. In **[France, the transfer of GMO responsibilities
to ANSM comes in the wake of new rules in January this
year.]{.underline}** These rules were outlined in a decree of 30
December 2021 that updated the processes for evaluating biotechnologies
and simplified the procedures relating to **[the uses of GMOS presenting
a \"zero or negligible risk.\"]{.underline}** From today, trial sponsors
can now use a new centralized \"simplified procedures\" platform for
submitting applications to ANSM for GMO trials, which can be accessed
via the ANSM website. The submission must be accompanied by a technical
dossier and a list of the trial sites. For deliberate release purposes,
companies must file an application for authorization, again using the
simplified procedure platform and including a technical dossier. The
content of the dossier, which was set out in a decree of 25 January
2022, should include an assessment of the potential risks posed to
public health and the environment, according to ANSM. Simplified And
Full Dossiers As of 1 June, a simplified dossier is required for
clinical trials of genetically modified human cells, adeno-associated
viral vectors, and authorized medicines. A full dossier is required for
any other type of viral vector. There are common application forms for
each of these types of trials. For genetically modified human cells, for
example, the form should be used for human cells genetically modified by
means of retro/lentiviral vectors, including genome edited cells. In
such cases, the applicant must show that there is no risk of formation
of replication competent virus, and that residual infectious
retro/lentiviral vector particles have been reduced to negligible
concentrations in the finished product, or there is negligible risk
associated with the presence of residual infectious viral vector
particles in the finished product. The form should also be used for
human cells genetically modified by means of adeno-associated viral
vectors, including genome edited cells, where the applicant demonstrates
that there is no risk of formation of replication competent virus; and
for human cells genetically modified without viral vectors, including
genome edited cells. For already authorized GMO-containing medicines to
be used in a trial, the information submitted should include the date of
EU marketing authorization, the latest update of the summary of product
characteristics, and any new risks identified and risk-minimization
measures implemented. The applicant should also explain why it considers
that the conduct of the proposed trial \"does not entail risks other
than those already assessed in the context of the marketing
authorization procedure.\" New Advisory Body Responsibility for trials
of GMO-containing medicines previously lay with the research ministry.
While ANSM has now taken over this role, the research ministry has set
up a new expert advisory committee on the contained use of GMOs. ANSM
can ask this committee for an opinion on matters relating to contained
use, while for deliberate release it can consult ANSES, the French
agency for food and environmental and occupational health and safety.

### 2ac AT Coop Fails -- Cyber - Data

#### Increased European cybersecurity cooperation [overcomes]{.underline} diverging data protection frameworks -- status quo challenges are a [test]{.underline} of relations NOT their breakdown

the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. ("Tests of
Partnership Transatlantic Cooperation in Cyber Security, Internet
Governance, and Data Protection," German Institute for International and

Edward [Snowden's revelations of the scope of surveillance conducted by
U.S. intelligence]{.underline} agencies have been the subject of much
debate in Europe, especially in Germany. It came as a surprise to many
that Europe's closest political ally has been intercepting private
communications on a large scale, even going so far as to wiretap
high-ranking officials of the European Union and its member states.
Moreover, the U.S. government has been and continues to use the most
important Internet platforms in daily use by Europeans --- Google,
Yahoo, Amazon, and others ---to acquire information about European
citizens, through methods that are fundamentally opposed to European
legal sensibilities and to the fundamental right of informational
self-determination. [These practices]{.underline} have [damaged the
transatlantic partnership between Europe and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and may well have resulted in a **breach of
trust** that **will prove irreparable**. [Some]{.mark} observers
[argue]{.mark} that **the two [partners' differences over the right
balance between cyber security and data protection are]{.mark}
ultimately [irreconcilable]{.mark}** because they are the product of
differing geostrategic positions.]{.underline} Because U.S. engagement
is more global in scope, the threats to U.S. security are thought to be
more serious than those faced by Europe. For this reason, ["Venus
Europe" and "Mars America" are unlikely to find common ground on cyber
security policy and data protection]{.underline} in the near future.
Indeed, [the kinds of cooperation in global multistakeholder Internet
governance that have been taken for granted in the past may well become
increasingly controversial in the future. **Al[though relations are
currently]{.mark} being [tested, the transatlantic cyber partnership
continues to stand on a solid]{.mark} normative and [institutional
foundation]{.mark}**. Both sides agree on the fundamentals of Internet
regulation. Both are of the conviction that universal accessibility to
the Internet is extraordinarily useful]{.underline} not only for
democratic decision-making and free markets but also for the future of
the liberal democratic order. [And both sides are united also in the
search for effective means to limit malicious software, to fight crime,
and to secure critical infrastructure. The [controversy
surrounding]{.mark} the [NSA]{.mark}'s espionage activities exposed
differences in what the United States and EU member countries consider
to be the legitimate means and methods of reaching their common goals.
It]{.underline} also [revealed that they have different approaches to
handling normative dissonance. Nevertheless, it certainly **[should not
be misunderstood as an existential threat to]{.mark} the [transatlantic
partnership]{.mark}**. Instead, **[transatlantic differences can]{.mark}
and should be [speedily resolved through political
dialogue]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Three major problem areas must be dealt
with in this process. Global: The present mode of Internet regulation
lopsidedly favors the United States and does not sufficiently integrate
the emerging powers of Brazil, India, South Africa, China, and Russia.
The concept of "multistakeholder governance" may rhetorically evoke
egalitarian fairness, but in practice camouflages the fact that U.S.
interests and U.S. corporations are de facto the most important agenda
setters in Internet governance. Financially weaker actors wield precious
little influence in central institutions such as the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) or the Internet
Governance Forum (IGF). [The United States and Europe have defended in
unison the existing governance model for a long time.]{.underline} The
recent disclosures about U.S. surveillance practices, however, are
causing more Europeans to question the status quo, and a realignment
with states like Brazil is taking place. Transatlantic: The EU and the
United States diverge sharply in their views on the most important goals
for transatlantic cooperation between national governments in the field
of cyber security policy, especially regarding the appropriate balance
of security and freedom. U.S. cyberspace policy is driven increasingly
by the military logic of deterrence, which entails maintaining and
strengthening an offensive capacity. Europeans, however, treat the
security aspects of cyberspace policy as a police matter, and their main
goal is strengthening systemic resilience and resistance to attack and
fraud. Accordingly, U.S. and European intelligence agencies differ in
their areas of responsibility and authority, and they have acquired
quite different attitudes regarding informational selfdetermination and
other civil liberties. [[To prevent]{.mark} these [differences
from]{.mark} de[generating]{.mark} into massive [conflict, **both sides
must engage each other** more openly]{.mark}.]{.underline} Success
depends on the United States and Europe recognizing that on both sides,
domestic politics limit the range of feasible compromise. As long as the
United States seeks to maintain its position as a dominant global power,
U.S. cyberspace policy will continue to be driven by national security
issues and thus also by the military logic of deterrence. For the EU,
however, questions of data protection will continue to be of central
significance as long as its approach to cyberspace is police-driven and
focused on improving its defensive capacities. Only [if these limits are
respected]{.underline} will [mutual cooperation in cyber security policy
and Internet governance find some middle ground that pays off for both
sides.]{.underline} Transnational: The transatlantic cyber partnership
is being challenged by a number of transnational conflicts involving
different perceptions of the proper state-citizen relationship.
Unfortunately, these require urgent attention at a time when mutual
trust between states and citizens has been eroded. Disclosures have
sensitized citizens to the dangers inherent in the digital revolution.
It is possible that public trust in the safety of Internet
communications has been deeply shaken and that some groups will begin to
demand the renationalization of information and communication technology
infrastructure. In the run-up to negotiations over the Transatlantic
Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), for example, demands for the
creation of supranational legal instruments and independent mediating
bodies are already being voiced. In the coming years, both the EU and
the United States will have to get used to emerging countries like
Brazil, India, South Africa, and Indonesia demanding the more frequent
use of multilateral agreements in Internet governance within the
multistakeholder process.

### 2ac AT NATO fails -- Cyber -- Deterrence

physical, state interests were tangible, and state-on-state attacks

states exist with one foot in the physical world and one in the virtual.

### 2ac AT China

#### International rules constrain China

**Mahbubani, 1/1 **(Kishore Mahbubani, Former President of the United
Nations Security Council, Asia Research Institute, National University
of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore, 1/1/2022, accessed on 6-20-2022,

[If America]{.underline} finally [changes its strategic thinking about
China, it will]{.underline} also [discover]{.underline} that [it
is]{.underline} [possible to develop a strategy that will both constrain
China and advance US interests]{.underline}. Bill Clinton provided the
wisdom for this strategy in a speech at Yale University in 2003, when he
said, in short, that **[[the]{.mark} only [way to manage the next
superpower is]{.mark} to create [multilateral]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[rules]{.mark} and partnerships that would tie it
down]{.underline}**. [For example, [though China]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[lays claim to]{.mark} [reefs]{.mark}]{.underline} and shoals [[in the
S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea]{.underline}, the [[UN
Law]{.mark} of the Sea Convention]{.underline} [[has prevented]{.mark}
[it from declaring the]{.mark}]{.underline} entire [South China [Sea an
internal Chinese lake]{.mark}]{.underline}. [China has also been obliged
to implement WTO judgments]{.underline} that have gone against it.
**[[International rules]{.mark} [do have a bite]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Fortunately, under [Xi Jinping]{.underline}, China [is still in favor
of]{.underline} [strengthening]{.underline} [the global multilateral
architecture]{.underline} the United States created, including the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the United Nations, and the
WTO. China has contributed more UN peacekeepers than the four other
Permanent Members of the UN Security Council combined. Hence, [[there is
a]{.mark} window of [opportunity for cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}
[between America and China in multilateral forums]{.underline}. To seize
the opportunity, American policymakers have to accept the undeniable
reality that the return of China (and India) is unstoppable. Why not?
From the year 1 to 1820, China and India had the world's two largest
economies. The past two hundred years of Western domination of global
commerce have been an aberration. As PricewaterhouseCoopers has
predicted, China and India will resume their number one and two
positions by 2050 or earlier. The leaders of both China and India
understand that we now live in a small, interdependent global village,
threatened by many new challenges, including global warming. Both
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} and India [[could have walked away
from]{.mark} the [Paris]{.mark} Agreement]{.underline} after Trump did
so. Both chose not to. Despite their very different political systems,
both have decided that they can be responsible global citizens. Perhaps
this may be the best route to find out if China will emerge as a threat
to the United States and the world. [If it agrees to be constrained by
multiple global rules and partnerships, [China
could]{.mark}]{.underline} very well [[remain a different
polity]{.underline}]{.mark}---that is, [not a liberal]{.underline}
[democracy---[and still not be a threatening]{.mark} one.]{.underline}
This is the alternative scenario that the "China threat" industry in the
United States should consider and work toward.

### 2ac AT Individual Interests Outweigh

#### Countries ignore individual interests for alliance commitments

[[Nations have powerful reasons to get]{.mark} their [military alliances
right]{.mark}.]{.underline} [When security pacts go]{.underline} [well,
they underpin]{.underline} regional and [global order;]{.underline}
[[when they fail]{.mark}, they spread wars across continents as [states
are dragged into conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} We would, therefore,
expect states to carefully tailor their military partnerships to
specific conditions. This expectation, Raymond C. Kuo argues, is wrong.
Following the Leader argues that **[[most countries ignore]{.mark} their
[individual security interests]{.mark} in military pacts]{.underline}**,
instead **[[converging on a]{.mark} single, dominant [alliance
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} The book introduces a new
social theory of strategic diffusion and emulation, using case studies
and advanced statistical analysis of alliances from 1815 to 2003. In the
wake of [each major [war]{.mark} that [shatters the international
system]{.mark}]{.underline}, a new hegemon creates a core military
partnership to target its greatest enemy. Secondary and [peripheral
[countries rush to]{.mark} [emulate this alliance]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[illustrating their]{.underline} [credibility]{.underline}]{.mark} and
prestige by mimicking the dominant form. Be it [[the NATO model]{.mark}
that seems [so commonsense]{.mark} today]{.underline}, or the
realpolitik that reigned in Europe of the late nineteenth century, a
lone alliance strategy has defined broad swaths of diplomatic history.
[It is not states\' own security interests driving this
phenomenon]{.underline}, Kuo shows, [but]{.underline} their jockeying
for [status in a world periodically remade by great powers.]{.underline}

### 2ac AT Reforms Fail

#### DoD reforms solves state capacity gaps

[From the start of a program to initial operating capability, where
systems were tested, took nearly eight years,]{.underline} she noted. As
a result, [the department looked to transform the acquisition process
and a lot was accomplished in the last year]{.underline}. \"Our [goal
was to **deliver a defense acquisition system that is flexible,** that
allows for tailoring, and empowers critical thinking and common sense
decision making, **with the outcome being an acceleration of delivery
and timelines,\"**]{.underline} she said. During 2020, **[a record 13
acquisition policies were published]{.underline}**, she said. \"[This
has been, at least in my experience, among the most transformational
changes to acquisition policy in years, and we really anticipate this
change in policy having really sustaining, enduring and positive effects
to the department for years to come.\" Cummings said]{.underline} the
redesign [in policy can be broken down into six discrete pathways that
are meant to be used individually or together, specifically tailored to
the capabilities that the program team has been asked to deliver to the
warfighter.]{.underline} They are: Urgent capability acquisition The
middle tier of acquisition Major capability acquisition, which is the
traditional milestone-based approach Software acquisition Defense
business systems Acquisition of services. Cummings said she didn\'t want
this to be a series of policy documents that people would pick up and
read from cover to cover. \"What I was really looking for is that it
would be interactive, and you would use the policy to help inform
decision making exactly when you need it.\" [Rapid delivery of software
upgrades used for weapons and communications systems and making them
cyber secure is another priority of the department, she
said.]{.underline} Cummings also touched on the need to address any
future shortages of medical supplies, microelectronics and critical
minerals, by working closely with interagency partners like the
Department of Commerce, the Department of Treasury and the Department of
Health and Human Services. [In the future, DOD will be using artificial
intelligence and machine learning to better manage its sprawling supply
chain and reduce vulnerabilities, she added.]{.underline}

APPROACHES FOR USAFRICOM",

As Robert Gates observed in 2010, "the US military was designed to
defeat other armies, navies, and air forces, not to advise, train and
equip them."\[1[\] Although meaning to achieve major operational effects
using a complex whole-of-government process, Component Commands are
operating with a generally undertrained and inexperienced security
cooperation workforce and an ever-evolving national decision process.
These issues complicate U.S. cooperation with even the most capable and
willing state partners.]{.underline} Since the Foreign Assistance Act
passed in 1961, the US Department of State has traditionally led US
security assistance to train, equip, and assist foreign partners, in
cooperation with agencies, to include the Department of Defense (DoD).
In practice, however, the US military is the largest implementer of
international security assistance and cooperation, usually charged with
improving Partner Nation capability in the security sector so as to
"create space" for diplomacy and development efforts. [Echoing the
sentiments of Mr. Gates, the DoD was not designed to collaborate easily
with US development and diplomacy efforts in countries facing complex
security environments.]{.underline} Historically, military leadership
has been hesitant to draw focus away from traditional military
operations to invest in advancing its foreign capacity-building
expertise and processes. This hesitancy has resulted in a
disproportionally large pool of well-meaning, forward-leaning novices
bent on doing, compared to few experienced security cooperation
professionals guiding the process. The imbalance between military
generalists and security cooperation specialists means that foreign area
officers, as the usual DoD representatives working with foreign nations,
often encounter a familiar pattern. A common example, particularly for
smaller coastal states, is the US donation of a small boat for maritime
and littoral patrols, a critical tool used for border security and
counter-illicit trafficking operations. Because the capability is
usually requested by a partner nation, US military planners often assume
the partner already possesses the "relatively basic" infrastructure,
funding, and personnel to receive and operate said boat. The reality,
however, is more nuanced. US program implementers typically (re)discover
some combination of the following issues: there are no easily
transferred processes, no training facility for maintenance personnel,
no regular or predictable budgets, no routine way to acquire parts, and
no human resources apparatus to attract, train, and retain top talent.
US military planners typically assume the partner nation has these
capacities, or can quickly generate them. Lauren Witlin, author of
"Mirror-Imaging and Its Dangers," would assert this tendency of
reverting to US norms is due to a lack of data and training, making
planners "look within his or her own experiences to fill in any
information gaps."\[2\] The gulf between the world's largest military
and a typical partner state's more modest security sector makes US
planners especially susceptible to proscribing untenable capability
building programs. The assumption that other nations can easily adapt a
"US-lite" model stands in stark contrast to the actual difficulty the US
has in building a capability that is also sustainable by a said nation.
Mirror Imaging Bias, limited training and lack of experienced security
cooperation professionals have taxed decades of military cooperation
provided to partners, resulting in, at best, a mixed record of lasting
success.\[3\],\[4\] [These issues have been **recognized by Congress and
reforms mobilized.** In 2016, the Congressional Research Service issued
a report detailing US Security Cooperation challenges, one of many such
papers from various think tanks and journals **lamenting poor results
from the security cooperation enterprise.\[5\] In response, Congress
launched significant, but slow-moving reforms codified in the 2017 and
2018 National Defense Authorization Act**s. \[6\] In 2016, Congress
mandated the DoD to "develop and issue... a strategic framework... to
guide prioritization of resources and activities." In 2017, Congress
reduced **multiple authorities into a streamlined band of activities
described in Chapter 16 of the U.S. Code.\[7\] It established new
requirements for human rights vetting, institutional capacity building,
and assessment, monitoring and evaluation (AM&E**). DoD consolidated
several security cooperation related agencies and organizations into the
Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA).\[8\] In 2019, the Defense
Security Cooperation University (DSCU) opened, establishing a
certification and career development path for security cooperation
professionals. In 2020, Congress funded small DSCA teams to conduct
Assessment, Monitoring and Evaluation (AM&E), both at the Pentagon and
at the Combatant Commands.]{.underline}
