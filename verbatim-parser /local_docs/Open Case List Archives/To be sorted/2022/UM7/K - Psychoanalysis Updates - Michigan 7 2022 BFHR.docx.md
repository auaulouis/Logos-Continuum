We were disappointed by Mario [Bunge's piece on the scientific status
of]{.underline} psychoanalysis (2 October, p 22). As a senior
philosopher of science, he could have offered interesting arguments, but
instead he [founded his criticism of the discipline on **factual
errors.**]{.underline}

[Psychoanalysis has developed greatly since Freud's time, producing
substantial research and productive connections to other branches of
science. Many basic psychoanalytic propositions have been **widely
accepted**, such as the formative impact of early childhood
relationships on adult personality]{.underline}. Some of Freud's
specific propositions have been eclipsed by later formulations -- as you
would expect for bodies of knowledge evolving for more than a century,
and certainly for any science. [The basic idea of a dynamic unconscious
that actively shapes conscious experience and relations with others has
made **productive connections with disciplines such as
neuroscience**.]{.underline}

[Psychoanalysts have been testing the outcomes of psychoanalytic
therapies for decades, using **randomised controlled trials and
systematic follow-up studies**, as called for by Bunge in his article.
Most trials have found good evidence of the effectiveness of
psychoanalytic therapies, when tested in the same way as other
approaches]{.underline}. Contrary to Bunge's assertion, [studies
included in Jonathan Shedler's review of meta-analyses of therapeutic
outcomes of psychoanalytic therapy did, of course, **have control
groups** (American Psychologist, vol 65, p 98).]{.underline}

[The **54 signatories to this letter include distinguished researchers
in psychoanalysis in the science faculties of leading world
universities**, who have acquired major public grants and have published
papers in high-impact, peer-reviewed scientific journals]{.underline}.
This level of scientific contribution compares very well with that in
other clinical professions.

Readers expect contributors to their debates to be informed as to the
facts, and scientific progress requires a respect for evidence. In this
spirit we respectfully offer some facts to reassure those concerned by
Bunge's entertaining jibes.

[Anyone inclined to credit Bunge's claim that psychoanalysts are
"foreign to the scientific community" should consider **examples**. The
psychoanalyst John Bowlby founded the burgeoning field of attachment
research partly to test hypotheses inspired by psychoanalysis about the
role of parents.]{.underline}

[The psychoanalyst Mark Solms has contributed to the neuroscience of
dreaming with research indicating that REM sleep and dreaming are
dissociable]{.underline}, and that dreams are caused not by the REM
mechanisms themselves but by basic motivational systems which are common
to all mammals and which arguably form the core of emotion and emotional
experience in human beings.

[Programmes linking psychoanalysis and neuroscience were initiated by
analysts **20 years ago**,]{.underline} and the journal
Neuropsychoanalysis was established in 1999 with an editorial board
including leading neuroscientists, cognitive scientists and
psychoanalysts. For the past 10 years there have been yearly conferences
at which neuroscientists and psychoanalysts have presented research and
discussed areas of overlapping interest (video proceedings and other
information available at neuropsa.org.uk/npsa).

P[sychoanalytic journals publish contributions involving psychoanalysts
and neuroscientists. Leaders in neurophysiological research on
depression have recently put forward an explicitly Freudian model in the
**Annals of General Psychiatry** (vol 7, p 9)]{.underline}. This year in
Brain, neuroscientists Karl Friston and Robin Carhart-Harris undertake
to "demonstrate consistencies between key Freudian ideas and recent
perspectives on global brain function that have emerged in imaging and
theoretical neuroscience" to show "construct validity" for Freudian
concepts and enable "dialogue between psychoanalysts and
neurobiologists" (vol 133, p 1265).

Such collaboration may, of course, contradict rather than confirm
psychoanalytic hypotheses, but [**it is enough to falsify** Bunge's
claim that psychoanalysis should be seen as pseudoscience. Or rather, it
would be enough, if Bunge's claim itself were subject to evidence,
rather than **abuse masquerading as philosophy.**]{.underline}
