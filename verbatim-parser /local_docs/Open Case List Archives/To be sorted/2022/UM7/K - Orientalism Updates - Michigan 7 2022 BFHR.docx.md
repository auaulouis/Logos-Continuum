Russian culture as a source of conflict and orientalism

Edward Said's seminal study, Orientalism,19 provided an account of how
**[Western cultural identity]{.underline}** [is shaped, formed and
defined through comparison and contrast to an Eastern
orient]{.underline}. For Said, [the orient has helped to
define]{.underline} Europe (or [the West]{.underline}) [as
its]{.underline} **[contrasting image]{.underline}**,
**[idea]{.underline}**, **[personality]{.underline}**
\[[and]{.underline}\] **[experience]{.underline}**." 20 Said's
groundbreaking study showed the West's ideological suppositions in
viewing the orient. Although originally developed from the colonial era,
orientalism illustrates how the West defines itself and its view of
others. Orientalism is a view [based on an]{.underline} "**[imaginative
geography]{.underline}**" and can be used to understand how the West
portrays the East.21 Orientalism provides a framework to understand
cultural constructs and purported differences.22 In this case, the
following study looks to the othering of Russia as an Eastern power.
[Western portrayals of the East have shaped identities and culture,
but]{.underline} "[crucially,]{.underline} **[it is not the actual,
geographic East and West]{.underline}** (wherever located) [that is at
issue]{.underline}" [it is the]{.underline} **[portrayal]{.underline}**
[of distinctive and opposing cultures.]{.underline}23 Russian imperial
expansion in the 19th century, has itself, often been a source of
orientalism within the work of Russian geographers, and anthropologists,
coming into contact with people in Central Asia.24 However, in
contemporary politics, [Russia is increasingly described in orientalist
terms that helps to otherize Russia as a distinctive culture that
differs to a liberal democratic West]{.underline}. The following section
argues that [it is]{.underline} **[cultural differences]{.underline}**
[that are]{.underline} seen to be [a]{.underline} **[primary
cause]{.underline}** [of geopolitical tensions]{.underline}.

[Geopolitical tensions]{.underline} between Russia and the West are
commonly understood in cultural terms. This [go]{.underline}es [beyond
an examination of differing national interests, to become
an]{.underline} **[ideological divide]{.underline}** [between
a]{.underline} **[liberal democratic West]{.underline}** [and
an]{.underline} **[irrational Russian East]{.underline}**. The [Cold War
confrontation]{.underline} between the Soviet Union and the U.S. [was
often expressed in ideological terms]{.underline}. [Russia was
portrayed]{.underline} in the Cold War [as an oriental enemy based on
godless communism against America's liberal democracy]{.underline}.25
What is significant about the portrayal of the opposing sides in the
Cold War is that [cultural explanations were used to explain state
behavior]{.underline}. The [Soviet Union]{.underline} was [seen as an
irrational enemy that was more likely to use nuclear
weapons]{.underline}.26 The Cold War conflict was also [viewed as an
"irreconcilable struggle between two fundamentally different value
systems."]{.underline} [American culture was celebrated for
its]{.underline} embracing of **[personal freedom]{.underline}**, [while
the Soviets were understood as an]{.underline} **[oppressive
empire]{.underline}**.27 Since the end of the Cold War, the West has
assumed that tensions would disappear and Russia would become more
"Western." Russia's actions in Ukraine and Crimea have led to the
revival of tensions, but crucially, [Russian culture is again seen to be
a major cause for conflict]{.underline}. The fall of the Berlin Wall led
the West to assume that "as Russia became more prosperous it would
become more like other European countries." 28 [The post-Cold War era
saw an ideological wave of support for a **Fukuyama-esque future** in
which Western style liberal democracy would spread inexorably across the
globe]{.underline}. Underpinning these views was [an ideological belief
in the]{.underline} **[evolution of progress]{.underline}** and a
[triumphalist understanding]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[Western
modernity]{.underline}**.29 [Liberal scholars in]{.underline}
**[IR]{.underline}** have [continue]{.underline}d [to claim that "there
is ultimately **one path to modernity**."]{.underline} 30 This
ideological understanding of politics in evolutionary terms vie[ws an
American West and a liberal international order as the highest form of
modernity]{.underline}. Russia's own interests and understandings of
political order can therefore be dismissed because of "Russian
backwardness." 31

The triumphalist post-Cold War mood led **[liberal scholars of
IR]{.underline}** to [argue that the West and Europe was in a
fundamental new era]{.underline}. The EU was [celebrated for achieving a
Kantian Peace]{.underline},32 having [created a new approach to
international politics through acting as a]{.underline}
**["civilian"]{.underline}** 33 [and]{.underline}
**["normative"]{.underline}** [power]{.underline}.34 [Conflict and
war]{.underline} within Europe [was believed to have been]{.underline}
all but essentially [eradicated]{.underline}. The political order of
European security based on international institutions and collaboration
was celebrated for creating [a Europe "whole, free and at
peace."]{.underline} 35 Some scholars even went so far as to claiming
Europe had moved into a new historical era through creating
"postClausewitzian political cultures" that openly questioned "the
utility of force." 36 Russia's own willingness to use force in defence
of its national interests has therefore caused disbelief amongst elites
within Europe. Russia's actions in Ukraine and Crimea caught European
elites by "surprise" 37 and led to criticisms of Western elites being
caught "napping." 38 The end of the Cold War created a Western ideology,
which believed in a "prolonged sense of inevitability about Russia
rejoining the West." 39 Russia's use of force in defence of its
interests led one observer to declare the West is "discovering that
Russia's understanding of events, its discourse, methods and calculus of
risk differ from its own." 40 The annexation of Crimea appeared to show
that Western triumphalism had misunderstood Russian culture and
identity, that the West had simply "got Russia wrong." 41

[Russia's]{.underline} annexation of Crimea and its **[involvement
in]{.underline}** the politics of **[Ukraine]{.underline}** [has been
explained largely through a cultural lens]{.underline}. According to
Mark Galeotti, Russia believes that it is fighting a "political" war and
"faces an existential cultural" threat from the "West." 42 In trying to
understand the Ukrainian crisis, [Russia's use of]{.underline} **[hybrid
warfare]{.underline}** [is explained as originating from a particular
"**ideological vision**]{.underline} and political
ambition["]{.underline} 43 and from the "worldview" of Russian elites
and society.44 Russia's actions in Ukraine are also attributed to the
way the Russia's leadership "look at the world." 45 Anatol Lieven argues
that overused analogies comparing Russia's actions to Nazi Germany also
[imply that Russia's leadership is a "force of absolute evil, drawing on
deeply rooted, malevolent elements of Russian culture."]{.underline} 46
[It is the]{.underline} "**[culture]{.underline}**" [of Russian
society]{.underline} and its elites that is [uniquely blamed for "the
return of geopolitics"]{.underline} to Europe.47 Analysts have rushed to
also explain these tensions [as a new "East-West"
confrontation]{.underline}48 [in which Russia's non-Western culture has
exacerbated the **divide between NATO and Russia**.]{.underline}

[This East-West divide continues an]{.underline} **[orientalist
tendency]{.underline}** [within]{.underline} **[Western security
debates]{.underline}**. The idea of a "West at war with an
[East]{.underline} conceived [as radically other is
pervasive]{.underline} and longstanding" [within]{.underline}
**[political discourse]{.underline}**.49 The War on Terror is just one
recent example of a long propensity within Western security discourse to
fall into an orientalist perspective. But it is during conflict and
warfare that an [orientalist perspectives frame an "us" versus
"them."]{.underline} Political discussions on the War on Terror often
[portray]{.underline}ed [a "law abiding, Christian and Western
civilization" as threatened by an irrational Eastern enemy that was
**"ever-resistant to modernity."**]{.underline} 50 In trying to explain
the return of geopolitical competition to Europe, [there is an
orientalist tendency to see Western states as **acting
rationally**]{.underline}, responding to incentives; [while Russian
foreign policy is shaped by a resistance to modernity and]{.underline}
the Russian culture of its elites, or by a **[primordial
instinct]{.underline}** [traced to its national character]{.underline}
and the weight of its history.51 As the following section explores,
Western political discourse toward Russia is often framed through this
orientalist lens.

**War is not a [dispute mechanism]{.underline}, but a [cultural
act]{.underline} securing the [Western identity]{.underline} against the
exotic, yet dangerous Other\-\--their portrayal of Russia's
"[irrationality]{.underline}" increases militarization and makes
peace-making [impossible]{.underline}.**

The subject of international relations (IR) has been defined by
questions of war and peace, and the foundations of the discipline can be
traced to debates on why states go to war. Cultural explanations of war
and culture as a source of conflict has also become a major strand of
research.1 Samuel Huntington's Clash of Civilizations went so far as to
suggest that cultural distinctions would define war and conflict for the
21st century.2 [Understanding war through]{.underline} **[cultural
identities]{.underline}** [demonstrates how groups]{.underline}
**["other"]{.underline}** the opposing side and how [war can play
a]{.underline} **[constitutive role]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}
**[social and political relations]{.underline}**. **[War
itself]{.underline}**, [can]{.underline} also [be understood as
a]{.underline} **[cultural act]{.underline}** [in which the traits of a
society are "violently affirmed."]{.underline} 3 However, **[the way IR
treats the concept of war]{.underline}** has recently [come into
criticism for its]{.underline} **[Eurocentric ontology]{.underline}**.4
[Eurocentric ideas and historiographies have]{.underline}
**[shaped]{.underline}** [and informed]{.underline} **[our
understanding]{.underline}** [of conflict]{.underline}. [War as a
cultural act]{.underline} can also [create a distinct]{.underline}
**[division of identity]{.underline}** [between "us" and
"them."]{.underline} This is evident in the way **[Western
wars]{.underline}**, [led by the US and]{.underline} its [European
allies]{.underline}, [are interpreted in very different ways to other
actors]{.underline}. **[Liberal democracies]{.underline}** regularly
[portray]{.underline} their [wars as conflicts against irrational
aggressors]{.underline}.5 While [non-Western war is seen as]{.underline}
**["criminal"]{.underline}** [in its intent or **irrational** in its
justifications]{.underline}.6

In portraying warfare through a cultural lens, [war]{.underline} often
[becomes a]{.underline} "**[potent site of orientalism]{.underline}**"
[where]{.underline} "[the West" is defined through opposition to "the
East."]{.underline} 7 It is a perspective that exaggerates cultural
differences and often [views other cultures, as]{.underline}
**[exotic]{.underline}**, **[uncivilized]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[dangerous]{.underline}**. [Orientalist
understandings of war portray **conflict between** distinct
**identities** of West and East]{.underline}. Western warfare is
understood through overwhelming firepower, surgical strikes and swift
action relying on advanced technology,8 while Eastern warfare is
portrayed in orientalist terms. [The East becomes]{.underline} seen as
[a source of]{.underline} **[irrational zealots]{.underline}** [who
embrace]{.underline} **[fanaticism]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[primeval violence]{.underline}**.9 [War creates an]{.underline}
**[existential crisis that shapes self-identity]{.underline}** and this
can be **[illustrated through]{.underline}** the **[tensions between
Russia and the West]{.underline}**. As this paper shows,
[Russia's]{.underline} recent wars [in]{.underline} Georgia (2008),
**[Ukraine]{.underline}** (2014) and Syria (2015-) ha[ve helped shape
Western and Russian discourse as competing identities and
cultures]{.underline}. Specifically, [Russia is often portrayed in
orientalist terms as an Eastern power that has rejected Western
values]{.underline}. The following paper argues that [orientalist
portrayals of Russia]{.underline} **[limit our
understanding]{.underline}** [of these conflicts and leads
to]{.underline} **[increased militarization]{.underline}** [as Russian
culture is seen as]{.underline} **[incompatible]{.underline}** [with
Western liberal values]{.underline}.

Historical patterns of [geopolitical competition]{.underline} between
the US and Russia have often been [understood through]{.underline} their
respective **[competing identities]{.underline}** [and cultural
explanations of contemporary Russia continue to be mired in cliches,
stereotypes and **caricatures**]{.underline}.10 [Stereotypes
of]{.underline} **[Putin "playing chess"]{.underline}** 11
[or]{.underline} "[facing up to the bear"]{.underline} 12 also continue
to **[shape Western discourse]{.underline}** [about tensions with
Russia]{.underline}. [Understandings of Russia then become]{.underline}
**[mired]{.underline}** [in attempts to explain Russian foreign policy
as]{.underline} **[irrational]{.underline}**,
**[deceptive]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[non-Western]{.underline}**. [This]{.underline} **[orientalist
perspective]{.underline}** [deserves to be investigated]{.underline}
because Russian culture is widely seen as a primary cause of conflict
and tension with the West. [Russia is accused of following
a]{.underline} "perpetual" and ["historical pattern,"]{.underline} 13
[in which Russia's actions can be understood largely through its
history, **national identity** and its expansive
**geography**]{.underline}. The culture of the Russian leadership and
its "way of war" 14 are viewed as a significant source of tension with
the West and one of the major causes of the Georgia15 and Ukraine
crises.16 These cultural explanations of the tensions between the two
sides [portray Russia as diverging from Western norms]{.underline}.17
This [creates an]{.underline} **[othering of Russia]{.underline}** [as
it is portrayed as the]{.underline} "**[West's mirror
image]{.underline}**" and antithesis.18 [Orientalist perspectives
**limit the possibilities of negotiation**]{.underline} [as the othering
of Russia leads to an]{.underline} **[increasingly militarized
dispute]{.underline}** viewed in cultural terms in which competing
identities are seen as radically different and incompatible.

**[Link\-\--Russia\-\--Capitalism]{.underline}**

**The [Western cosmology]{.underline} as the center of the globe
reproduces [psychically]{.underline} and [racially
motivated]{.underline} violence against the [Russian Other]{.underline}.
Fascism is not the [enemy]{.underline} of capitalism, but an
[endpoint]{.underline}. The real enemy is [leftist
uprising]{.underline}.**

**Charles 22**, Hampton Institute, (Julien, "Resurrecting the Ghouls: On
the West\'s History of Hating Russians and Rehabilitating Nazis",

The character in the novel embodied a version of Edward Said's
[**Orientalism**, a process by which the West]{.underline}
**[caricatures]{.underline}** [other regions, nations, and
people]{.underline} in cartoonish and sophomoric ways. The better to
understand them [at a glance]{.underline}. Almost [like a kind of
intellectual shorthand by which to characterize and dismiss entire
populations]{.underline}. Perform conceptual violence on them until they
can be shunted into a shape that slides neatly into a western man's
conception of the world. **[Fits the Western cosmology]{.underline}**,
[in which the U.S. and Europe shine as lodestars in a firmament of
flickering blight. Everything in the heavens is of course in desperate
need of guidance from the **western polestar**]{.underline}.

Examples of the dynamic of Orientalism are particularly rife in
Hollywood. Countless series and movies have pitted pious Americans
against a raft of crackpot Latinos, Slavs, Arabs, Persians, and Asians
bent on genocide, world domination, and numberless other monomaniacal
schemes. There's of course no small amount of projection at work here in
the fictional stylings of "the best minds of \[our\] generation", as
Ginsberg put it.

Not unlike the Kepler book, the Tom Cruise Jack Reacher films capitalize
on the by now threadbare trope of a Soviet psychopath set loose in the
naive and peaceable democracies of the West. The Zec is a man who
escaped or survived the gulags in Siberia to wreak havoc on the West. In
one scene, he describes how he once gnawed off a few fingers to avoid
working in Siberian sulfur mines. A man of such exceptional capacities
is no doubt useful to certain organizations, he muses. The Zec then
encourages one of his low-level thugs to chew off his thumb as a show of
fidelity, or some such deranged proof. The man---human, all too
human---cannot do it and is summarily executed. The bloodless Zec then
waxes psychopathic, wondering why westerners are so weak.

Observe the set pieces in the Jennifer Lawrence vehicle Red Sparrow.
Scenes from the West are well-lit and overflowing with human emotion;
scenes from behind the "iron curtain" are dimly lit, drab in color,
stylistically old-world, barren of human empathy. In short, thoroughly
depressing. Of course, as part of Lawrence's character Dominika's
training in demolishing her human emotions (weaknesses all) and steeling
herself in the arts of pitiless manipulation, she must appear naked
before her class and satisfy the lust of a man who previously assaulted
her.

**[CHRONIC RESENTMENTS]{.underline}**

These are caricatures of Russians who evidently have been thoroughly
dehumanized by life in the USSR. [What has really dehumanized these
characters is the **propaganda** which invented them]{.underline}.

[Few events ignite this kind of Orientalism more than a war or proxy war
with Russia, America's]{.underline} **[bete noire]{.underline}**.
Despite the fact that the wall has been down for 30 years. Despite the
fact that the West enjoyed an extended period of unrestrained looting in
the Former Soviet Republics. During which time mortality rates
skyrocketed for citizens of those fledgling states, thanks principally
to the loss of the generous social supports that underpinned their
Soviet economies. Despite the fact that Vladimir Putin is an avowed
neoliberal who has repeatedly sought deeper integration with Europe and
America, like a stepchild desperate to claim his birthright among a
welter of siblings. Despite all this, [Putin]{.underline}'s patriotic
desire to reconstitute Russia as a viable economic and military power
has damned him irreparably in the eyes of the West. He [is like Kepler's
killer, the manifestation of undiluted evil. Except that Putin is
real.]{.underline}

[All this comes from a long lineage of]{.underline}
**[Russophobia]{.underline}**. It [dates back to the Napoleonic Wars in
Europe]{.underline}, which stirred fears of Russian plots to conquer
Europe; t[o subsequent paranoia by British colonialists that Russia
would steal the Indian subcontinent from its grasp; to the war to unseat
the Bolsheviks]{.underline} and blistering responses to stories of mass
slaughter under Soviet rule. In 1944, Hitler described Russians thusly,
"These are not human beings: they are beasts from the Asiatic steppes,
and the battle I am leading against them is the battle for the dignity
of the people of Europe." This view summarized the ideology behind
Germany's plan to murder 100 million Russians after the defeated the
USSR. Likewise, we rarely hear that one of the small handful of groups
energetically targeted for liquidation by the Nazis were communists.
[The Russians sacrificed 27 million people fighting off fascism. This
loss is also infrequently highlighted.]{.underline}

The **[McCarthyite paranoia]{.underline}** [was a particularly acute
instance]{.underline} of this chronic phobia. One can catch a whiff of
the age-old bigotry in the propaganda of the present moment. The
reflexive aggression toward Russia action [in Ukraine]{.underline} (a
recent article in The Times (UK) was entitled, **["Russia's casual
savagery is seared into its soul"]{.underline}**) [This latest surge of
bile seems in part an explosion of]{.underline} **[unresolved
angst]{.underline}** from the Russophobia of the Trump years, and
perhaps a hundred years prior, though partially diffused by the fall of
the wall. Yet it was still there even in the post-wall melees of
capitalist looting under the doddering oversight of the Pushkin-quoting
boozer Boris Yeltsin. Russians, Muscovites mostly, were freshly depicted
as amoral, thieving mafiosi seduced by the flash of capital, the men
brutal grotesques and the women biddable jades. Little was made of the
valueless cosmos into which they'd been hurled by the blitzkrieg of
capital on a society not remotely prepared for it.

(Much like the diagnosis of mental health in the West, problems of
post-fall Russians were and are localized in the person, in the soul of
a people, rarely traced to their societal causes. The New York Times
just released a series on the "Inner Pandemic" of mental health issues,
though it spends little time focusing on the circumstances that
generated these crises, and which it enthusiastically supported.)

**[Even today]{.underline}** [one finds strains of the old]{.underline}
**[Hitlerian trope]{.underline}** [coursing through the]{.underline}
**[western mainstream]{.underline}**. Recently on Germany's ZDF channel,
a guest of the Markus Lanz Show reminded viewers, with a slim smile,
that, **["Even if Russians look European, they are not
European."]{.underline}** She rambled on incoherently about the Slavic
view of death and noted that, **["They have no concept of a liberal,
post-modern life."]{.underline}** She may as well have said they were
beasts from the Asiatic steppes and referred viewers to the Jack Reacher
movie. After which, perhaps, they might donate to the latest national
purity fund.

[This seems to be part unhinged racism, but also a]{.underline}
**[psychological necessity]{.underline}** [for enemies in
nation-states]{.underline}. And **[one wonders if race isn't utilized to
that end]{.underline}**. And [whether this psychological need springs
from a desire for national purpose, or more from an]{.underline}
**[unrelenting need of capital]{.underline}** [for new markets---and the
geospatial requirements that go with it]{.underline}. Surely the
historical Lebensraum looms large behind modern geopolitical conflicts.

**[ADDICTED TO CONFLICT]{.underline}**

But [it isn't just the]{.underline} **[xenophobic fear]{.underline}**
[of Slavic people.]{.underline} There's another element at work here.
One is reminded [of Colin Powell, former leader of the Joint Chiefs of
Staf]{.underline}f---and dissembler nonpareil---before the U.N. Security
Council. He once told a reporter that he [feared he was]{.underline}
**["running out of enemies"]{.underline}** [in the aftermath of the fall
of the Soviet Union]{.underline}. [He was unwittingly disclosing
a]{.underline} **[clandestine principle]{.underline}** [of **Washington
foreign policy**]{.underline}. Namely, that [it must always have an
enemy. It cannot conceive a world of peaceful inhabitants, engaged in
serene market exchange, celebrating a peace dividend]{.underline} while
occasionally reminding new generations of the perils of conflict. [This
is not a conceit in the mental universe of the planners of]{.underline}
**[American hegemony]{.underline}**, be they retired generals on media
networks, cabinet lieutenants sketching hemispheric takeovers, or
well-compensated scriveners in beltway think tanks. And certainly not
among the lurid corridors of K Street defense lobbyists. **[If Putin did
not exist, Washington would have invented him]{.underline}**. Much as
they invented, to a surprising degree, Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda
henchmen.

More often than not, the enemy must be cut from whole cloth. They do not
ordinarily present themselves. [Few countries are interested in going to
war with the United States. At worst most nations are disinterested in
submitting themselves to American rule, which manifests in numberless
ways]{.underline}, a protean ogre extending its tentacles across the
globe. [Soft power, hard power,]{.underline} **[invisible
power]{.underline}**. [Be it the petro dollar]{.underline} and the SWIFT
system that places a subject nation under the perpetual threat of
American sanctions. (A form of economic colonialism.) Be it **[bilateral
security]{.underline}** arrangements that infiltrate the country with
U.S. military personnel and ensnare it in long-term weapons contracts
with beltway defense contractors. (A form of military subjugation.) Be
it onerous and odious [loan agreements]{.underline} with Bretton Woods
institutions that enslave generations of citizens to corrupt banks of
the global North. (A form of vassalage.) From which those citizens'
meager avenues of escape include metastasizing debt service and
consequent debt deflation, firesales of national patrimony, or the
trauma of default, runaway inflation, and economic collapse. Choose
wisely.

Rather than being enemies of the American state, [such nations would
really rather be left alone]{.underline}. [To experiment with
alternative economic models including socialism and its various
hybrids]{.underline}. To trade in local currencies. To align in regional
economic blocs. [But this option--attempting to implement an economic
structure other than western neoliberalism--is **anathema to
Washington**]{.underline}. Just ask Russia, China, Iran, Venezuela,
Brazil, Syria, Libya, North Korea, and any other nation that wishes to
forge its own path.

THE REAL ENEMY

Which brings us to [the real enemy of the United States]{.underline}.
Despite reports to the contrary, it [is **not fascism**]{.underline}.
[Fascism is merely an]{.underline} **[end-point of
capitalism]{.underline}**, [which will almost assuredly emerge wherever
capitalism is practiced in unregulated and unrepentant
fashion]{.underline}. As middle class wealth craters, however broadly,
and extreme wealth and privilege expands, however narrowly, [it will
require force to generate compliance within a resentful and restive
population. We are **witnessing this transition** in the West **right
now**.]{.underline}

All this to say that, no, [fascism was never the primary
nemesis]{.underline}. **[The real enemy is communism]{.underline}**.
[Western capital cannot abide the notion of a workers\' state full of
nationalized enterprises committed to the general welfare]{.underline}.
One which deprioritizes the profit motive and tars it with the stigma of
avarice and usury. [This is and has always been Washington's worst-case
scenario, which it watched materialize in the Bolshevik Revolution, a
knife in the side of capital that drew blood for 74 years]{.underline},
and which it tried hysterically to end all the while.

Not even the shameful scourge of Nazism rising up in the heart of
civilized Europe was enough to lift fascism above communism as public
enemy number one. As John Steppling notes in an excellent essay on the
rehabilitation of fascism, Arthur Schweitzer, author of Big Business in
the Third Reich, says that many [German businessmen saw virulent
anti-semitism as little more than a form of "economic policy
reform."]{.underline}

It is instructive to read works like The Splendid Blond Beast, which
outlines the myriad deceptions of the postwar era of supposed
deNazification in Western Europe. As it turns out, [Washington
was]{.underline} **[torn]{.underline}** [on the prosecution of Nazi war
crimes]{.underline}. Although Frederick [Roosevelt]{.underline} and
others supported harsh punishment, [helped establish Nuremberg and sent
principled judges like Robert Jackson]{.underline}, others like powerful
Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles and his Secretary of State
brother John Foster Dulles sought [to]{.underline} **[shield
German]{.underline}** industrialists and **[military
officers]{.underline}**, all [deeply]{.underline} complicit and
[enthusiastic collaborators in the Nazi extermination
campaigns]{.underline}.

[Then there was]{.underline} **[Operation Paperclip]{.underline}**, [a
full program dedicated to]{.underline} **[repatriating
Nazis]{.underline}** [in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and installing them in key posts in pivotal internationalist
institutions like the UN.]{.underline} And **[Nato's]{.underline}**
alleged **[role in Operation Gladio]{.underline}**, code name for a
series of stay behind secret armies committed to armed resistance, acts
of subversion, and terror, that [were to be activated in the event of an
invasion of Western Europe by Warsaw Pact nations]{.underline},
something never on the books in Moscow, but alive [in the feverish
imagination of beltway anti-communists]{.underline}. These dispersed
embedded and hastily assembled paramilitaries were actually [left behind
to agitate against and prevent the rise of leftist]{.underline} (see
communist) [political blocs]{.underline}. They operated in Italy,
Greece, France, Germany, Portugal and across Northern Europe. Nato, the
CIA, and various European intelligence agencies were not about to watch
Western Europe go communist regardless of what the democratized masses
aberrantly desired.

Much of this **[history suggests]{.underline}** [that the]{.underline}
**[underlying need of capitalism]{.underline}** [for new markets is
primary]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} perhaps that **[race is a
tool]{.underline}** [leveraged to]{.underline}
**[rationalize]{.underline}** [what is at bottom base
exploitation]{.underline}. Hence our general acceptance of fascism in
Ukraine and hysteria against Russia.

The **[fighting in Ukraine]{.underline}** and the annexation of Crimea
[has been interpreted as a "frontal challenge to the post-Cold War
European regional order."]{.underline} 57 [Russia's actions
created]{.underline} **[surprise]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[shock]{.underline}** [for analysts and policy makers]{.underline}
alike, [but there have been few serious investigations into Russia's
strategic decisions]{.underline}. [Instead]{.underline}, **[Western
public discourse]{.underline}** has [followed an]{.underline}
**[orientalist trend]{.underline}** [in blaming an]{.underline}
**[irrational leadership]{.underline}** [and its]{.underline} **[Eastern
culture]{.underline}**. The [use of force by Russia is]{.underline} also
seen [as uniquely linked to **Putin**'s leadership]{.underline}. The
[Ukraine]{.underline} and Georgia [crisis is blamed on Putin's "unique
response"]{.underline} 58 [and Putin's "choice."]{.underline} 59 [There
seems]{.underline} **[little attempt]{.underline}** [to
explore]{.underline} either [the workings of the Russian
leadership]{.underline} or to consider in more detail why Russia chose
to intervene. [Instead, there is a tendency to embrace]{.underline}
**[simplistic arguments]{.underline}** [blaming Putin's "unconstrained,
erratic adventurism."]{.underline} 60 [Western analysts argue Putin's
"surprise policy decisions," and his "rashness," "have astounded even
expert analysis."]{.underline} 61 What is significant about the attempts
to blame solely [Putin]{.underline} is that he [is seen as]{.underline}
**[uniquely responsible]{.underline}**. Putin as the sole figure
involved is [then portrayed as an "ideologue"]{.underline} 62 [and as a
"gambler."]{.underline} 63 His actions are [not seen as the rational
choice of a leader responding to a realpolitik environment]{.underline}.
However, counter arguments have been made which show Russia's hybrid war
in Ukraine was not an irrational opportunistic gamble, but an attempt to
coerce Kiev into negotiations.64 But while such alternative explanations
have been discussed in academic publications they have not been widely
covered within the Western media.

[The Ukraine crisis has]{.underline}, however, [been widely
covered]{.underline} in the media [for its use of]{.underline} **[hybrid
warfare]{.underline}**. The [surprise and confusion]{.underline} these
events created within Western political commentary [was intertwined with
an]{.underline} **[orientalist perspective]{.underline}** [that sought
to highlight Russia's]{.underline} **[cultural
differences]{.underline}** [to the West]{.underline}. **[Hybrid
warfare]{.underline}** [has been described as a conflict between "East
and West."]{.underline} 65 What is significant in this portrayal is that
Russia's hybrid warfare is then [viewed in omnipotent terms which
exaggerates Russia's power and ability]{.underline}.66 [Western
observers have long]{.underline} **[demonized]{.underline}** [Eastern
tactics in war as]{.underline} **[irrational]{.underline}**,
**[deceptive]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[underhanded]{.underline}**.67 In describing Russia's actions, Western
analysts repeat this formula by [accusing Russia of using "shadowy
tactics"]{.underline} 68 of being "sneaky" 69 and using tactics [based
on "deceit."]{.underline} 70 [Hybrid warfare is further interpreted with
reference to the Ancient Chinese strategist Sun Tzu]{.underline}.71 The
reputation of Sun Tzu as an Eastern general [willing to use deception
and secrecy to win battles]{.underline} is then [compared to Russia's
own use of asymmetric warfare]{.underline}.72 But crucially, this
historical analogy devolves further into an orientalist perspective when
[Russia is accused of being, not just a "sneaky" Easterner, but
by]{.underline} **[not playing by "the rules."]{.underline}** 73
[Russia's use of asymmetric warfare is not interpreted as a]{.underline}
**[rational response]{.underline}** to material or strategic
constraints, [but is blamed for being **deceptive**.]{.underline}

The significance of these critiques is that [Russia is accused of not
acting in a manner acceptable to the West]{.underline}. [Russia's hybrid
war is understood as breaking the rules]{.underline} and as Martin Zapfe
argues, Russia "seems to have rejected the established Western
playbook." 74 [It is the]{.underline} **["strategic
culture"]{.underline}** [of Russia which is seen to be at fault in
rejecting Western ways of war]{.underline}.75 These [portrayals of a
Russian East as enigmatic and dangerous, diverging from Western norms
shows an orientalist perspective.]{.underline}76 Looking to Sun Tzu in
order to understand contemporary military strategy can be illuminating.
But what makes these perspectives problematic is the way Russia is
viewed as acting in a way that the West would never contemplate. For
example, [Russia is accused of being uniquely better suited to hybrid
warfare because of Putin's "central guiding authority."]{.underline} 77
[This]{.underline} **[ignores]{.underline}** [that the concept of hybrid
warfare originated with the US]{.underline}78 [and]{.underline}
**[Western uses of]{.underline}** [deception]{.underline}, [covert
tactics or]{.underline} **[proxy fighters becomes]{.underline}**
essentially **[ignored]{.underline}**. Rod Thornton argues further that,
"the basic problem across the board is that liberal democracies have an
inherent distaste for producing anything at the strategic level that
resembles propaganda or could be classed as psychological warfare." 79
[The]{.underline} **[long US history of propaganda]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[covert war]{.underline}** [in both the Cold War and
the War on Terror is therefore]{.underline} negated and **[exempt from
consideration]{.underline}**. As Rory Cormac and Richard Aldrich have
argued, much of **[IR]{.underline}**, "[offers a]{.underline}
**[simplistic view of secrecy]{.underline}**" [and Western covert action
by taking]{.underline} "[plausible deniability at face
value]{.underline}." 80 [Attempts to critically analyze Russia's use of
asymmetric warfare have therefore failed to fully engage with the West's
own use of covert warfare]{.underline}.

**Their [call out]{.underline} of the Ukrainian invasion is a [deceitful
attempt]{.underline} to make you [forget]{.underline} about US
interventions in Yemen, Libya and Syria that were [more
brutal]{.underline}. Don't buy their propaganda.**

But [even if an invasion were our threshold for outrage, none of this
pathos has been evident in]{.underline} **[our response]{.underline}**
[to the U.S.-backed **Saudi war on Yemen**]{.underline},
[or]{.underline} [**U.S. wars** on **Libya and Syria**]{.underline}.
[Even though the western aggression is criminal and death tolls are

As Arthur Ponsonby says in his book Falsehoods in War Time,
[deceitfulness is extraordinarily useful because humanity is mendacious
and credulous in near equal measure. It]{.underline}
**[lies]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[refuses to

member of British Parliament writing after World War I, says that
[nations must "justify themselves by depicting the enemy as an undiluted
criminal; and secondly, to inflame popular passion for the continuance
of the struggle."]{.underline} Obviously little [has changed since our
**initial experience**]{.underline} [of industrial warfare. We are
constitutionally and economically committed to]{.underline}
**[domineering aims]{.underline}**, are [inimical to anything that might
impede our expansion]{.underline}, and [we]{.underline}
**[rationalize]{.underline}** [our behavior to these ends

**[racist caricature]{.underline}**. It is a frightful concoction of
pitiless greed and base prejudice.

Yet [every time we think we have put these cruel rancorous sides to our
human selves to rest, they reappear, refashioned in new apparel, with
**fresh logic**, **ironclad rationales**]{.underline}. **[We are sold a

no]{.underline} real [surprise to citizens of a country that worships a
single skill, salesmanship, and a single "virtue", wealth, as its most
sacred values]{.underline}. **[Everything is a commodity]{.underline}**
[and everything that has been sold in the past will be sold
again]{.underline}. Our entertainment culture is rife with reproductions
of yesterday's stories. **[Why not re-commoditize

insignia of a new battalion. Lionize a new leader, dress him in army
green and pose him on the marble stairs of the halls of power, sandbags
stacked to the roofs behind him. **[Honor under siege]{.underline}**.

[What has been sold before will be sold again; what we have hated before
we will hate again]{.underline}. If it isn't quite eternal return then
it surely is **[history recurring as tragedy then farce]{.underline}**.
[This soft embrace of fascism and rabid anti-communism goes all the way
back to the Bolshevik uprising]{.underline}. As one of Kepler's Nordic
tales is subtitled, ["Sometimes the past won't stay

surface.

**[Link\-\--Balkans]{.underline}**

**Their Balkans securitization is an [unsophisticated trope]{.underline}
that simultaneously renders them an [insignificant Other]{.underline}
and a [disease]{.underline} in need of [NATO's cure]{.underline}.**

**Bryan 18**, University of San Francisco, (Madelynn , "Geopolitics And
The Balkan Other: The Uses Of "Balkanism" In NATO Expansion",
Undergraduate Honors Thesis,
<https://repository.usfca.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&context=honors>)
//CHC-DS 🐱‍👤

By manipulating long-established [negative representations and
historical narratives]{.underline}, the VOA **["others"]{.underline}**
[Serbia, Macedonia, and Bosnia to create an urgent necessity for their
accession to NATO]{.underline}. The [uses of]{.underline} **[balkanist
discourses]{.underline}** for the purpose of NATO expansion [have
significant implications, both theoretically and
practicall]{.underline}y. In terms of theories of the "other," it
presents an unusual case study of "othering." Since "othering" involves
emphasizing contrasts between groups, it is typically a mechanism of
exclusion. However, in the balkanist discourses of VOA, the "othering"
functions to compel inclusion in a particular group. This is not to
suggest that the "othering" of these three countries is not for the
purpose of invoking a contrast as described by Wolf (1994). The
[discourses maintain]{.underline}ed the [depictions of]{.underline}
**[backwardness]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[volatility]{.underline}** of past discourses [on the
Balkans]{.underline} without remarkable variation. The negative
representations then [followed an expected dynamic of contrasting with
and thus]{.underline} **[defining]{.underline}** [a **NATO of
progressiveness**]{.underline}, **[stability]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[democracy]{.underline}**---[a NATO that
will]{.underline} **[cure the disease of Balkan-ness]{.underline}**
[with its all-encompassing transformative influence.]{.underline}

Hence, [the contrast]{.underline} encourages these countries to seek
inclusion in NATO in two ways. By defining the more positive image of
the West, it [strives to increase the attractiveness of NATO
accession]{.underline}. Moreover, [the]{.underline}
"**[othering]{.underline}**" cr[eates a false separation between the
Balkans and Europe (e.g. the West)]{.underline}. If countries within
NATO and the EU are indubitably within Europe then [there is no
geographic basis for "othering" the Balkans in these terms]{.underline}.
To the east, west, north, and south, NATO and EU members surround them.
Thus, [creating this distance between them and the EU coercively compels
them to join NATO in order to be part of Europe and the
West]{.underline}. [The discourse]{.underline}
"**[others]{.underline}**" [them in order to produce a]{.underline}
**[false need to legitimize their place]{.underline}** [in
Europe]{.underline}, inversing the usual exclusionary purpose of
"othering." This is not to imply that the geopolitical uses of balkanism
are homogenous. For example, the EU may well "other" these countries in
order to preserve their "outsider" status given that more is at stake
economically and politically in integrating them than in the case of a
military alliance. Since the geopolitical uses of balkanist discourse
have proven malleable across time, it may differ depending on
perspective as well. More research could increase our understanding of
how and why balkanism continues to be a salient mechanism of geopolitics
in different periods and contexts.

The current [balkanist discourse has practical implications]{.underline}
as well. As Hammond (2004) showed of early balkanist discourses, they
have [geopolitical uses with real political impacts]{.underline}. The
specific purpose of balkanist discourses have changed but not the way
[they lend themselves to geopolitical power dynamics]{.underline}.
Kovacevic claims that **[Montenegro]{.underline}** "[becomes a
mere]{.underline} **[pawn in the geopolitical chess game]{.underline}**
[by the]{.underline} **[antagonistic colonial powers]{.underline}**
[which NATO must win at **any price**]{.underline}" (2017, 46). The
[same could be said of the three countries]{.underline} in this study
**[as the US embroils them]{.underline}** [in their disputes with Russia
and other countries]{.underline}. [They claim to offer]{.underline}
**[protection]{.underline}** [to the Balkans yet **do not prove** that
their involvement in the region is any different than the countries of
which the US warns them]{.underline}. [They are more interested
in]{.underline} **[hindering the advances]{.underline}** [of the other
'malign foreign influences' or rather, countries with which the US
currently has disagreements, than helping the Balkans.]{.underline}

By supporting those politicians in Macedonia, Serbia, and Bosnia who
most reflect western discourses, the US may alienate those in power from
the people of the country. The difference in US discourse on the current
Macedonian Prime Minister Zaev and his predecessor, as discussed
earlier, revealed the difference in how the US discusses the politicians
who reflect their agenda. Zaev most emphatically adhered to US
discourse. The results are more than merely misguided perceptions of the
Balkans. [As domestic politicians receive more international legitimacy
by adhering to these discriminatory discourses, they become partakers of
the balkanist discourse, "othering" their own people. Just as the US
does, the domestic **political elite manipulate
representation**]{.underline} [of their people to their own political
ends]{.underline}. [The US uses balkanist discourses to]{.underline}
**[control]{.underline}** [them at the level of the nation while the
domestic politicians serve an]{.underline} **[image]{.underline}** of
the Balkans [to the West as it prefers to see them]{.underline}.

If the political elite seek NATO membership to strengthen ties with the
US, it could be against the desires of the people. As the opinion polls
showed in the case of Montenegro, attitudes on NATO accession tends to
be far from homogenous in the former Yugoslav states (Citizen's
Attitudes on NATO Integrations, 2015). Its controversial reception in
Montenegro is also a point of Kovacevic's article (2017, 50). It is then
possible [the US and NATO use balkanist discourses to support regimes in
the Balkans that derive their power from the approval of the West rather
than the will of the people, negating its supposed aim of truly
spreading democracy]{.underline}. This raises the further question of
how elite political discourses differ from those of the general
population. One cannot assume that because the political elite reflect
western balkanist discourses, the population does as well. Differences
in their discourse would better reveal the extent to which these uses of
balkanism alienate the politicians from the people and whether the
encouragement of NATO membership mispresents the general will.

Finally, my study begs the question of why such blatant balkanist
discourse as that found in VOA survives so unchanged to the current day.
Said's seminal Orientalism has arguably ruptured the continuity of
Orientalist representations. Of course, people may still employ
Orientalist stereotypes, but his general ideas have entered mainstream
thought. When employed, Orientalist representations are more likely to
be in a nuanced form. No such rupture of balkanism is evident. As
Goldsworthy notes, writers who would "consider themselves to be advanced
exponents of European multicultural ideals" can write of people in the
Balkans "with the sort of generalised \[sic\], open condescension which
would appal \[sic\] them if applied to Somalis or the peoples of Zaire"
(1998, xi). The easy continuance of balkanism is not from the lack of an
academic exposé as the literature exemplifies. Goldsworthy's comment
suggests that, since the Balkans are within Europe, Europeans did not
recognize their discourse on the Balkans as discriminatory.

Considering my earlier anecdote from the research program in
Switzerland, I propose that the continuity of balkansim relates to the
perception of the Balkans' unimportance. While the VOA's
[discourse]{.underline} **[inflates]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}
**[significance]{.underline}** [of these countries' need for
NATO]{.underline}, it [simultaneously]{.underline}
**[trivializes]{.underline}** [the Balkans through representations
of]{.underline} **[unsophisticated tropes]{.underline}**. The domestic
political elite then confirm this triviality rather than challenging it.
[The emphasis on the Balkans' unimportance allows the discourses to
remain unnoticed by the public eye.]{.underline} This is what leads
generally well-informed people such as my colleagues in Geneva to
dismiss a study of the Balkans. [The **arrogant trivializing** of Balkan
countries allows such discriminatory discourse to continue unchallenged
among critical circles]{.underline} where it should receive censure.

**[Link\-\--Middle East]{.underline}**

**Their [policy research]{.underline} of Middle East securitization

[Despite]{.underline} the [bountiful evidence of the fallacies of
exceptionalism]{.underline}, **[Western policymakers]{.underline}** [and
researchers]{.underline} have [subject]{.underline}ed [the Middle East
to a]{.underline} **[particularly toxic]{.underline}** [form of
analysis]{.underline}, [falsely attributing its problems to
innate]{.underline} **[cultural]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}
**[political traits]{.underline}**. In reality, **[Western
interventions]{.underline}**, [from the colonial era to the War on
Terror]{.underline}, [have shaped the region's politics and often
**drove its conflicts**]{.underline}. Edward Said's Orientalism,
published in 1978, remains one of the clearest articulations of this
argument---that [Western policy and ideas have **exceptionalized** the
Middle East]{.underline}, throughout history, [as if the region operates
under different rules than human societies everywhere else in the
world]{.underline}.5 [Policymakers and analysts in the West built policy
around these **unfounded**]{.underline}, often **[racist
assertions]{.underline}**, [including]{.underline}
**[tropes]{.underline}** [about Islam being incompatible with democracy,
or]{.underline} about [sectarian and ethnic violence being supposedly
normal and routine]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} **[Western
exceptionalizing]{.underline}** [of the Middle East has
driven]{.underline} **[pernicious policies]{.underline}** [by the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and other Western governments,
including]{.underline} **[support for violent regimes]{.underline}** [in
the Middle East;]{.underline} renditions and **[U.S. outsourcing of
torture]{.underline}** [to Middle Eastern partner
governments;]{.underline} [indiscriminate **targeting of
civilians**]{.underline} [in the War on Terror;]{.underline}
**[mass]{.underline}** and extrajudicial [**detentions**;]{.underline}
[and the]{.underline} **[diminution of rights]{.underline}** [and due
process for enemies labeled as terrorists]{.underline}.

**[Policy]{.underline}**, **[research]{.underline}**, and academic
institutions **[have made exceptionalism]{.underline}** [an all
but]{.underline} **[permanent]{.underline}** [feature of their output by
putting regional experts and expertise into silos]{.underline}. Some of
this regionalization is an unavoidable feature of organizing research
departments or policymaking institutions, which [systematically and
structurally promote analysis and]{.underline} **[knowledge
production]{.underline}** [around either geographic, disciplinary, or
functional categories]{.underline}. As a result of these organizational
and structural factors, even experts who consciously seek to overcome
exceptionalism or regional silos can unwittingly fall into blinkered and
institutionalized professional habits.

In this project, Maya Mikdashi describes, in her dialogue with Karma R.
Chávez, a compelling example of how such exceptionalism is reproduced in
academic research:

It is rare for a book in queer, gender, or feminist studies (or a
"theoretical" book more generally), which is anchored in research in the
United States, to be encumbered with a title that ends with the hanging
phrase "in the United States." Instead, the title is location-less, and
in some cases, so is the writing itself, as if research conducted in the
United States should speak for the world. [The United States is treated
as an exemplary place from which to derive or produce narratives (or
theories) that are universal or universalizing in reach]{.underline}.6

By the logic of exceptionalism, the Middle East can only teach us about
itself. It cannot contribute to theory, nor have relevance beyond its
location.

The efforts in Transnational Trends in Citizenship build on those of an
earlier Century International project, Citizenship and Its Discontents.
Participants in this precursor project, which concluded in 2019, found
considerable common ground in the quest for universal rights across
borders and identity categories in the Middle East. Citizenship and Its
Discontents sought ways to discuss the quest for meaningful citizenship
and universal rights within the diversity of the Middle East.7
Transnational Trends in Citizenship extends the idea beyond the regional
prism.

Analyst and humorist Karl Sharro, one of the participants in Citizenship
and Its Discontents, began in 2016 to jokingly refer to himself as a
"WENA expert" (Western Europe and North America), poking fun at the
reductive nature of much analysis of the MENA (Middle East and North
Africa) region.8 But Sharro's joke contains a powerful insight, and a
handy method to test regional generalizations for exceptionalism. Any
analytical tool that serves MENA should do the same for WENA. By the
same token, analysis that is reductive, bigoted, or essentialist doesn't
serve any case; a statement about WENA that is patently ridiculous will
be equally silly for the MENA region. Comparison can help reveal poor
methods in order to quickly discard them. For example, consider how
quickly serious Western thinkers would dismiss, out of hand, an inquiry
into whether Christianity is inherently violent or compatible with
democracy, or whether "American culture" is mature enough to accept the
compromises inherent to legislative democracy. If the question is
untenable when applied to a familiar society, it should not be applied
to another society, either.

Overcoming Exceptionalism

Acknowledging the harm that exceptionalism does to analysis and policy,
and expunging it from the questions we ask and the writing we produce,
are important steps toward overcoming it. But except[ionalism is deeply
ingrained in inquiries about both the MENA region and Western Europe and
North America]{.underline}. [Going beyond area-based
silos]{.underline}---[and conquering
exceptionalism]{.underline}---[means]{.underline} creating **[new
methodologies]{.underline}** [and new approaches to]{.underline}
**[knowledge production]{.underline}**. Transnational Trends in
Citizenship attempts to advance such a methodology, by putting experts
on the Middle East and the West and their parallel inquiries on equal
footing.

[European leaders]{.underline}, who [view with suspicion and
'identitarian' Orientalism all immigrants from beyond the Mediterranean
and elsewhere, especially those coming from the Middles East and Muslim
countries]{.underline}.

In his article titled: "Imperialist political rhetoric", the Arab
thinker Joseph Massad (2020) argues that th[e United States has expanded
its neoliberal efforts during the presidency of Ronald
Reagan]{.underline} (1981-1989), the 40th U.S. president,
[to]{.underline} **[contain the entire globe]{.underline}**, [and to
change the **chief political ideas used by the International Left**
against the United States' global power]{.underline}. Massad reaffirms
that [these colonial ambitions have rested on an essential goal:
to]{.underline} **[reshape the international political
culture]{.underline}**, not just [inside but also outside]{.underline}
of the [U.S. borders]{.underline}. Drawing on Francis Fukuyama's
argument of the end of history, [such a mission would be described
as]{.underline} **["liberal democracy."]{.underline}** In his
provocative article "The End of History?", Fukuyama argues that the
historical class struggle between the 'master and slave' wouldn't have
realistically ended without Western democracies and the free market
economy. [The future, Fukuyama argues, is bound up with capitalism, in
the face of which all other international systems stand
defenseless]{.underline}. Here, I pose a rhetorical question: [if
Fukuyama were right, what has American democracy brought to the Middle
East ‒]{.underline} assuming that it is based on the principles of
justice, equality and freedom as enshrined by the Founding Fathers ‒ [in
light of the]{.underline} **[endless American
intervention]{.underline}** policie**[s]{.underline}**, the last of
which is the Deal of the Century[?]{.underline}

The **[Western universal ideology]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[rhetoric of terror]{.underline}** [go hand in hand as a]{.underline}
**[Western-centric narrative]{.underline}**, [exhibited as]{.underline}
a sort of an **[epistemological]{.underline}**,
**[therapeutic]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[civilisational
apparatus]{.underline}**. It is [derived from]{.underline} Jacques
[Derrida's notion of "Pharmakon" (or the remedy) which ‒ according to
this Western-centric rhetoric ‒ **cures** the backward
periphery]{.underline}. [However, we only find this Pharmakon to
be]{.underline} ‒ as put by Mustafa Said, the protagonist in Tayeb
Salih's novel, "Season of Migration to the North" ‒ [a
"germ".]{.underline} Said says as he sets the scene for such a
historical and narrative trial: "[They imported to us the germ of the
greatest European violence, as seen on the Somme and at Verdun, the like
of which the world has never previously known, the germ of a deadly
disease that struck them more than a thousand years ago]{.underline}"
(Salih, 1991, p. 95).

The [emerging Western consensus around the importance of]{.underline}
this **[inside logic]{.underline}**, [involving the pursuit of
international security through the construction of particular types of
institutions within]{.underline} the [potentially problematic
states]{.underline} of Central/Eastern Europe, [found expression in
the]{.underline} early 19[90s]{.underline} in the key documents,
conventions, and charters of European reconstruction. In a situation [in
which Western decision makers regard]{.underline}ed the **[liberal
democratic values]{.underline}** of the transatlantic community
[as]{.underline} **[universally valid]{.underline}**, [the concept of
promotion of "good" institutions of domestic governance came to be
synonymous with the projection of liberal democracy]{.underline} into
the former Communist countries of Europe. [The]{.underline} **[Western
discourse]{.underline}** [on international security]{.underline}
articulated in the early 1990s [depict]{.underline}ed [the triumph of
liberal democracy]{.underline} (particularly against "flawed,"
"dangerous" pro-Communist projects) [as the]{.underline} **[source of
progress]{.underline}**, [freedom, and stability]{.underline} in and
among Euro-Atlantic states. By extension, it presented the projection of
the same values in the former Eastern Bloc as a solution to the problems
of ex-Communist states, and, at the same time, as a key to broader
European security.

The [Kantian ideas that found expression in the prevailing Western
discourse]{.underline} at the end of the Cold War [reflect
a]{.underline} **[particular understanding of human
nature]{.underline}**. [Kantian liberalism relies upon liberal selves as
actors who are committed to the struggle to discipline the irrational,
violent sides of themselves, and to govern their lives in accordance
with]{.underline} the [universal moral precepts]{.underline} **[revealed
by reason]{.underline}**. [Self-discipline]{.underline}, from this
liberal perspective, [is the]{.underline} **[basis of
respect]{.underline}** [and admiration of self and others, as well
as]{.underline} a [central]{.underline} element [in]{.underline} the
process of [identity]{.underline} definition. From the point of view of
liberal democratic polities, **[only]{.underline}** those
**[self-disciplined communities]{.underline}** [who live according to
the same moral precepts]{.underline}---[embodied in liberal democratic
norms and institutions]{.underline}---**[are entitled to full
respect]{.underline}** [and to be recognized as
trustworthy,]{.underline} **[like-minded polities]{.underline}**. As
such, they are [to be included in relations of community]{.underline}.
113 Key to this liberal definition of subjectivity is a refusal of
essentialist determinism, by which, by virtue of their capacity for
reason, [all humans are seen as]{.underline} capable of grasping the
moral law and hence of [having the potential to]{.underline}
**[evolve]{.underline}** [into the kinds of actors who understand and
accept the self-disciplinary duties of]{.underline} **["correct"
subjectivity]{.underline}**. 114 **[Within i]{.underline}**nternational
**[r]{.underline}**elations, [this view of subjectivity translates into
the argument that even people of deviant]{.underline}
[**(anti-liberal)** polities can]{.underline}, through the use of
reason, [come to accept the responsibility of learning to conform to
liberal democratic norms]{.underline}. In other words, [all polities
embody the]{.underline} **[potential]{.underline}** [to evolve
into]{.underline} **["good," rational]{.underline}**, and ethical
**[communities]{.underline}**, [entitled to]{.underline} the [full
respect and benefits]{.underline} accorded to liberal democracies in
international society. [The view of a]{.underline} **[changeable, fluid
human nature]{.underline}** [renders practices of socialization
reasonable]{.underline}, for it entails the idea that even citizens of
previously anti-liberal polities (e.g., ex-Communist states) can learn
the norms and institutions of liberalism.

**[Symbolic power]{.underline}** [is power to construct a]{.underline}
**[hegemonic version of reality]{.underline}**.\' [The means of
production in this sense is also the means to produce]{.underline}
**[distorted images of dominated people]{.underline}**.
[Hence]{.underline}, **[resistance]{.underline}** [also involves
**resistance to the imaginaries**]{.underline} [produced by the
hegemonic power]{.underline}. [Palestinians are victims of symbolic
violence in two ways. The first is the]{.underline} **[\'terrorist\'
stigma]{.underline}**, [with which the occupying power has
labelled]{.underline} Palestinian resistance organisations, if not
[the]{.underline} whole [Palestinian population]{.underline}. [The
second way is]{.underline} that described by Edward Said in
**[Orientalism]{.underline}**, [the imaginary of the]{.underline}
**[\'Arab mind\']{.underline}** by the Israeli writer Raphael Patai, or
by Sainia Hamady\'s imaginary of the temperament and character of Arabs
[that]{.underline} Said quotes:

The Arabs \... have [demonstrated an incapacity for disciplined and
abiding unity]{.underline}\.... They show [lack of coordination and
harmony in organization and function, nor]{.underline} have they
revealed [an ability for cooperation]{.underline}. Any collective action
for common benefit or mutual profit is alien to them \... The Arab has
little chance to develop his potentialities and define his position in
society, holds little belief in progress and change, and finds salvation
only in the hereafter.2

The production of such imaginaries dominated the writings of the early
Israeli social science establishment, as has been documented by Elia
Zureik.3 [The focus was on the Palestinian as an individual actor, on
\[their\]]{.underline} ~~his/her~~ **[psychology]{.underline}**,
**[culture]{.underline}**, **[value system]{.underline}**, [temperament
and so forth]{.underline}. [Attachments to extended kinship systems,
labelled \'familism\', were interpreted as if Arabs were resistant to
Western-style industrialisation and development]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} by implication, to [democratisation]{.underline}.
Raphael [Patai in The Arab Mind is a telling example]{.underline} of
this approach.4 Patai [leans on]{.underline} **[psychological cultural
explanations]{.underline}** [when he describes the]{.underline}
**[stagnation]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[backwardness of
Arabs]{.underline}**, [claiming that \'the problem\' is rooted in mental
configurations]{.underline}, as the title of his book suggests.5 [Arabs
have a \'sense of marginality which never allows an Arab to detach
\[themself\]]{.underline}~~himself~~ [from \[their\]]{.underline}~~his~~
[traditional culture\', Patai writes]{.underline}-the Arab [has a
\'proclivity to blaming others for]{.underline} his own [shortcomings
and failure]{.underline}. Since [the West]{.underline} is the most
readily available scapegoat, it [must take most of the blame, with that
goes inevitably most of the hate.\']{.underline}6

Alroy, building on Patai, claims that Palestinian resistance against
Israel is based on \'basic personality traits peculiar to Arab
peoples\', which [refers to the notion that]{.underline} **[\'the Arabs
are a fiercely vengeful people\']{.underline}**.7

[This]{.underline} **[imaginary of Arabs]{.underline}** [has significant
political implications]{.underline}. For example, [Waschitz asserts that
\'various social and communal groups\']{.underline} (the terms used when
[referring to Palestinians]{.underline}) [lack the \'psychological
readiness\', the cultural qualities that are needed to be members of a
democratic society]{.underline}.8 [This is the]{.underline}
**[underlying message]{.underline}** of these interpretations of Arab
social organisation: [Arabs or Palestinians do not have the]{.underline}
**[\'civic\' ethos]{.underline}** [necessary for political
communities]{.underline}. [The political implication is]{.underline}
what Said has called the project of **[\'Orientalism\']{.underline}**:
**[\'They cannot represent themselves; they must be
represented\']{.underline}**. This is the quotation from Marx that is
stated on the opening page of Orientalism.9

[A measure of the powerfulness of states is their ability
to]{.underline} **[thwart attempts]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[unmask that power]{.underline}**.10 **[\'Terrorism\']{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[\'familism\']{.underline}** [or]{.underline}
**[\'Arab mind\']{.underline}** [labels]{.underline} equally [serve
as]{.underline} **[powerful inventions]{.underline}** [that]{.underline}
[**legitimise continuous colonial** economic or political
**projects.**]{.underline} The imaginaries of \'terrorism\' and \'Arab
mind\' backwardness are closely connected. The latter explains the
former as irrational-violence thus becomes the product of a backward
culture. I will argue that this way of explaining the violence of
peripheralised people in conflict is a form of symbolic violence, a form
that has been characterised as the \'new barbarism thesis\'.

The **[new barbarism]{.underline}** thesis

What is meant by \'new barbarism\'? Paul Richards has used the term to
[criticise presentations of political violence that omit political and
economic interests and contexts when describing that violence, and
present the violence as resulting from traits embedded in local
cultures]{.underline}.\'2 [With]{.underline} the US President George
**[Bush\'s]{.underline}** description of a **[\'war on
terrorism\']{.underline}** following the September 11 attacks as a
\'crusade\', and the Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi\'s
statement on 26 September 2001 that [\'We should be conscious of
the]{.underline} **[superiority of our civilization\']{.underline}**,
the dubious success of this world view is indicated.\'3

How is the new barbarism thesis produced? Zygmunt Bauman has argued that
[in modern societies]{.underline} **[racist imaginaries need
professional organisation]{.underline}**, [leadership and
experts]{.underline}.\'4 These are [provided by the]{.underline}
**[moral authority]{.underline}** [that state apparatuses need to rest
their claims on:]{.underline} **[science]{.underline}**. Thus,
**[opinions that have a scientific validity]{.underline}**, [but at the
same time a language that allows them to reach broader audiences, as
well as a]{.underline} language understandable to [politicians, are very
applicable]{.underline}. Who are the \'scientific\' alibis for new
barbarism? Richards has pointed out the US writer Robert Kaplan as a
main proponent.\"5 I will deal in some length with a recent work by
Kaplan, and then try to indicate how his thoughts resonate with
neo-Orientalist sentiments in American academe.

The **[double logic]{.underline}** [of international
security]{.underline}

In exploring the way in which [both]{.underline} the
**[inside]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[outside]{.underline}**
[modes of pursuing international security are embodied in
NATO]{.underline}, let us start with the international constitutive
structure that enables these solutions. [As constructivist
I]{.underline}nternational [R]{.underline}elations
[theorists]{.underline} have [argue]{.underline}d, [the **principle of
sovereignty** plays a key constitutive role in the modern international
system]{.underline}.14 [As the **principle of differentiation** between
the units populating the modern world, sovereignty conveys special
connotations of **exclusiveness** and **possessiveness**]{.underline}.15

The emergence of sovereignty as the key principle of international
organization meant that [states---as the main politico-administrative
units of the modern world---came to embody particular forms
of]{.underline} **[property]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[authority]{.underline}**.16 Most importantly, [within
clearly]{.underline} **[demarcated territorial
boundaries]{.underline}**, [sovereigns acquired the right to issue and
enforce definitions and rules regarding]{.underline} the [proper
organization of the political community]{.underline}.17 [Those
rules]{.underline}, which applied universally to individuals inhabiting
the state, effectively [drew the boundaries between normal and
unacceptable principles of]{.underline} **[political]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[socioeconomic]{.underline}** [life]{.underline}.

[As a consequence of the]{.underline} **[triumph of
sovereignty]{.underline}**, [the modern period gave rise to
the]{.underline} **[promise of peace, order, and progress]{.underline}**
within political communities [where everyone was subject to sovereign
rule]{.underline}. [But the creation of pacified political communities
simultaneously]{.underline} **[re-created]{.underline}** the problem of
**[insecurity]{.underline}** [at the level of the state
system]{.underline}, since there was no overarching authority to enforce
order among the sovereigns endowed with particular---sometimes
competing---wills and interests. The problem revolved around the tension
between the universal system (the world) and the particular entities
(sovereign states) inhabiting it.

The principle of sovereignty entails two possible solutions to this
problem, both of which are reflected in modern political thought and
practice.18 There is an [outside solution, which emphasizes]{.underline}
**[geostrategic arrangements]{.underline}** [among sovereign
units]{.underline} operating in an arena devoid of central authority.
This solution is often [presented]{.underline}---[particularly
in]{.underline} **[neorealist theories of i]{.underline}**nternational
**[r]{.underline}**elations---[as the **only possible way** of pursuing
international security]{.underline}. [In their view]{.underline}, given
the tragic but inescapable verities of international relations,
[sovereigns have little freedom of choice in their
interactions]{.underline}. The notion that underlies this solution is
that anarchy is less intolerable at the level of states than it is at
the level of individuals in a "state of nature."19 At the international
level, **[freedom]{.underline}** [combines with the]{.underline}
**[inevitable inequality]{.underline}** [of states to give rise to such
spatial arrangements as]{.underline} international **[domination by
powerful state(s)]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[balances of
power]{.underline}**. The international system will, by necessity, be
the arena where alliances form, break down, and re-form on the basis of
new configurations of material power. Particular geostrategic
arrangements come and go, but the dynamic governing their formation
remains unchanged in a realm that lacks an overarching authority.20

But [the principle of sovereignty]{.underline}, which constitutes
particular units in a universal system, [enables yet another mode of
pursuing international security]{.underline}. It might be possible to
achieve orderly and peaceful interaction among particular sovereign
states [if a way could be found to]{.underline} **[(re)shape
entities]{.underline}** [in such a way that they would
become]{.underline} **[peaceful]{.underline}**,
**[predictable]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[trustworthy]{.underline}** [participants]{.underline} in
international interactions. The tension between a universal system and
entities endowed with particular wills would thus be resolved [by having
those particular states internalize a universally valid set of
rules]{.underline}. This solution [assumes that]{.underline} particular
domestic structures---those that are built around **["good"
values]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[institutions]{.underline}**--- [will generate stability and
peace]{.underline} among states that possess such structures.
Accordingly, it [sets out to create conditions under which states would
come to be]{.underline} **[governed]{.underline}** [by such]{.underline}
**[rational]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[ethical values and
norms]{.underline}**.21

At the same time as it constitutes the possibility of pursuing the
inside approach, the principle of sovereignty also has regulative
effects on its implementation.22 Through its injunction regarding
non-intervention by external actors in the domestic affairs of states,
this principle was designed to protect the right of sovereigns to build
"good" institutions of governance. In the theory of international
relations, the inside mode of pursuing security and world order is
particularly associated with the work of Immanuel Kant.23 The Kantian
solution to international insecurity takes the form of a peaceful
federation of states. But that federation can only be achieved via
inside politics, for members of the pacific federation must become
liberal republics.24

In modern international politics, state policymakers have used both
modes of pursuing security. [The inside approach]{.underline}, while
sometimes forgotten by theorists of international relations, has played
an important role by providing decision makers with an additional option
on the menu of possible ways of pursuing security. This approach,
involving the construction and protection of domestic institutions
regarded as progressive and peace generating, [found expression in the
activities of NATO throughout its history]{.underline}. But the inside,
Kantian-inspired mode of pursuing security has acquired unprecedented
importance to the organization in the particular context of the
post--Cold War world.

[In establishing, enlarging, and transforming NATO]{.underline},
[Western decision makers]{.underline} were [enact]{.underline}ing [a
particular]{.underline} **[conception of]{.underline}** the
**[identity]{.underline}** [of their community and]{.underline} the
historically specific nature of [threats]{.underline} to that community.
In that context, [the politics of inside---aimed at]{.underline} the
protection and promotion of a community of [liberal democratic
values---was always an important dimension of NATO]{.underline}, and
placed limitations on the geostrategic policies acceptable to the
alliance. As the next chapter shows, historical records of the Cold War
period refute potential claims that the inside dimension only mattered
when NATO did not have any serious outside concerns.

**[Techno-Orientalism\-\--Topic Link]{.underline}**

**NATO is not constructed by [geopolitical borders]{.underline}, but by
the [collective identity]{.underline} of the West that seeks \"to
safeguard the [freedom]{.underline}, [common heritage]{.underline} and
[civilization of their peoples]{.underline}.\" The basis of security
cooperation disfavors aiding the ["inferior" East]{.underline}, dividing
the world into a [racial hierarchy]{.underline} with [Asiatics at the
bottom]{.underline}.**

[A border]{.underline}, argued Georg Simmel, [is not a]{.underline}
**[geographic fact]{.underline}** that has sociological consequences,
[but a]{.underline} **[sociological fact]{.underline}** [that takes
geographic form]{.underline}.54 The same can be said of regions.
[Neither the North Atlantic nor Southeast Asia existed as geographical
facts. Both were **politically constructed**]{.underline}.55

The policy of the United States regarding the organization of both
regions is puzzling. From a realist perspective, the U.S. preference for
multilateralism in Europe after World War II is quite surprising. As
Steve Weber notes, a hegemon can maximize its bargaining leverage by
forging a series of bilateral deals with its allies rather than tying
its hands in a multilateral framework.56 Conversely, liberals would
probably find the U.S. preference for bilateralism in Southeast Asia
after World War II the greater puzzle. As Anne-Marie Burley notes,
multilateralism is \"the form to be expected from a set of international
regimes established by a liberal state.\"57 A satisfactory explanation
must account for both U.S. choices.

The [effects of]{.underline} **[collective identity]{.underline}** [are
an important ingredient]{.underline} to any such explanation. The
[institutional forms the United States favored]{.underline} in Europe
and Asia [during the early Cold War were shaped by the different levels
of identification that U.S. policymakers had with these newly
constructed regions]{.underline}. **[Identification]{.underline}**, as
Martha Finnemore notes, \"**[emphasizes the affective relationships
between actors]{.underline}**\" [and]{.underline} \"[is an ordinal
concept, allowing for degrees of affect as well as changes in the focus
of affect]{.underline}.\"58 An argument about the importance of
identification in driving U.S. policy in these two regions is consistent
with what is perhaps the dominant psychological theory about group
identity and its effects---**[social identity theory]{.underline}**.59
[Once people identify themselves as part of a particular group, studies
of social identity have found, they treat members of that group very
differently than those outside the group]{.underline}. For instance,
when people distribute gains within a defined group, they tend to look
more toward maximizing absolute gains; [in dealing with outsiders they
tend to focus more on]{.underline} **[relative gains]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[maximizing the differential]{.underline}** [between
insiders and outsiders]{.underline}.60 These findings have been
[consistent across studies even with the flimsiest and most arbitrarily
defined group]{.underline}s. In short, [identification is
the]{.underline} **[mechanism]{.underline}** [that helps connect the
construction of specific regional groupings in Europe and Asia to
particular]{.underline} **[institutional
features]{.underline}**---multilateral or
bilateral---**[of]{.underline}** particular **[military
alliances]{.underline}**.

Looked at from the perspective of social identity theory, U.S. policies
in both regions become less puzzling. Once the North Atlantic was
constructed as a region that put the United States in a grouping of
roughly equal states with whom it identified, multilateral organizing
principles followed closely. As Ernest Bevin, the British foreign
minister put it, bilateral relations imposed by the strongest power,
similar to what the Soviets were doing in Eastern Europe, are \"not in
keeping with the spirit of Western civilisation, and if we are to have
an organism in the West it must be a spiritual union .. . it must
contain all the elements of freedom for which we all stand.\"61 U.S.
policymakers agreed, believing that the Europeans could be trusted with
the additional power a multilateral institution would give them and that
the Europeans deserved this increased influence.

Lacking strong identification, the United States did not, however, apply
the same liberal principles when it came to organizing the newly created
Southeast Asian region. Once **[Southeast Asia]{.underline}**, [in the
view of U.S. policymakers, was constructed as a region composed
of]{.underline} **[alien and]{.underline}**, in many ways, **[inferior
actors]{.underline}**, bilateralism followed closely. U.S. [policymakers
did not believe that the Southeast Asian states could be]{.underline}
**[trusted]{.underline}** [with the increased influence a multilateral
institution would offer]{.underline}, nor was there any sense that these
states deserved such a multilateral structure.

What was the basis for the identification of the United States with
Europe and the lack thereof in its relations with Asia? The available
evidence is relatively sketchy and permits only cautious inferences. In
their identification with Europe, U.S. officials typically refer to
religion and democratic values as the bedrock of a North Atlantic
community. A common race is mentioned, though less often, perhaps
because Germany\'s genocidal policies in the 1940s had thoroughly
delegitimated that concept in European political discourse.62 Perceived
affinities of various types reinforced the political trust rooted in
common democratic political institutions, [\"we-feeling,\" and \"mutual
responsiveness\"]{.underline} that Karl Deutsch and his associates have
described [as central ingredients of the emergence of a North Atlantic
security community]{.underline}, [defined by the existence of dependable
expectations of peaceful change]{.underline}.63 [In the case
of]{.underline} **[Asia]{.underline}**, [these various affinities and
trust were absent]{.underline}, religion and democratic values were
shared only in a few cases, and **[race was invoked as a powerful
force]{.underline}** [separating the United States from
Asia]{.underline}. The U.S. preference for multilateral or bilateral
security arrangements followed from these different constellations.

The Origin of the North Atlantic Community. The [creation of the
political concept of the]{.underline} **[North Atlantic
community]{.underline}** [is an]{.underline} excellent [example of the
process of identification at work in U.S. politics as well as a
demonstration of how]{.underline} **[issues of identity]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline} **[entwined]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} material
factors and **[instrumental political calculations]{.underline}**. The
emergence of a North Atlantic region followed a dramatic change in the
prevalent image of the United States\' place in the world that occurred
during World War II. Before the war, Alan Henrikson argues, maps were
typically drawn with the United States in the center surrounded by two
oceans. However, the efforts to resupply Great Britain and to later
transport large numbers of troops to Europe caused a change in that
cartographic and cognitive image. During and after the war, more and
more maps appeared that put the Atlantic in the center with the United
States and Europe positioned on opposite sides. During World War II, the
Atlantic association thus became more natural.64 The shift to a
\"North\" Atlantic focus was given a boost after 1945 when the Soviet
Union pressured Norway to sign a defense pact. Had the Soviet Union
established a zone of influence over Norway it would have gained a large
window on the Atlantic and thus exposed Europe\'s northern flank.65

The [creation of the new geographic category of \"North
Atlantic\"]{.underline} also served clear political ends and
[was]{.underline} in some ways [the product of calculated political
agency]{.underline}. Martin Folly, for example, argues that \"the idea
of a North Atlantic system was a stroke of genius\" on the part of
Ernest Bevin.66 In the early 1940s, the British government embarked on a
political strategy aiming to prevent a disengagement of the United
States from Europe after the end of the war. Bevin recognized that the
United States would hesitate to join a \"European\" alliance, but would
feel much more comfortable talking about sea-lanes, access to bases, and
a \"North Atlantic\" alliance. [A North Atlantic focus meshed nicely
with the U.S. military\'s concern with \"stepping stones\" across the
Atlantic]{.underline}. [Reliant on bases and stopping-off points for the
transportation of troops and equipment across the Atlantic]{.underline},
the armed services\' emphasis on the importance of Iceland, Greenland,
and the Azores also put the Atlantic in the foreground.67 In U.S.
domestic politics, the focus on a North Atlantic community had a
two-fold advantage. It promised to be an easier sell to an electorate
and a Congress wary of European entanglements;68 furthermore, [the
concept of]{.underline} **[\'community\']{.underline}** [established a
**basis for identification**]{.underline} [that transcended
military-strategic considerations]{.underline}.

Terminological innovation also suited Canada. Seeking to minimize
bilateral dealings with the United States, Canada opposed any sort of
\"dumbbell\" shaped arrangement combining a North American and a
European pole. A North Atlantic arrangement would allow Canada to use
the European states as a balance against the United States. It would
also allow the Canadian government to portray its concessions to the
alliance as concessions to a North Atlantic group of states and not
solely as concessions to the United States. In short, a North Atlantic
community meant that Canada did not have to deal with the United States
alone.69

It is important to note that this geographically defined category
constrained, but did not determine membership. If geography is destiny,
the inclusion of Italy, \"unwashed by Atlantic waters,\" in NATO was
clearly an anomaly.70 So was the subsequent accession of Greece and
Turkey. Even after George Kennan acquiesced in the creation of a North
Atlantic treaty, he continued to oppose Italy\'s participation. Only by
limiting the treaty to a strict geographic area, Kennan reasoned, could
the United States avoid provoking the Soviet Union and offending other
allies by their exclusion. As Kennan saw it, \"the only sound standard
for membership in the Atlantic Pact was indeed a geographic one.\"71
While the administration readily conceded that Italy was not in the
North Atlantic, it continued to support Italy\'s inclusion because it
was too important to Atlantic defenses to be left out.72 Italy\'s
inclusion among NATO\'s founding members, along with that of
undemocratic Portugal (given the strategic importance of the Azores),
underscore the importance of eclectic explanations that encompass both
strategic calculations and regional identities. In these two cases, the
geographically defined region and the sense of identification with
fellow democracies proved less decisive than strategic calculations in
determining membership. Italy\'s membership ended up being
consequential, however, because even as it violated \"the \'natural\'
geographic basis of the North Atlantic, it had the subtle effect of
extending the Atlantic concept itself to eventually include both the
Western and the Eastern Mediterranean.73

In 1948, official and public discourse regarding Europe saw a major and
sudden change. Before March 1948, a possible transatlantic alliance was
invariably discussed under the rubric of a European or a Western
European alliance. After March 1948, however, the focus of official
discourse, as reflected in the documents produced at the time, shifted
radically to an Atlantic or North Atlantic treaty system and community.
The public discourse, as indicated by the coverage of the New York
Times, underwent a similar transformation in late 1948. For example, in
the editorial cartoons offered in the \"Week in Review\" section, [the
graphical opponent of the Soviet Union changes from Europe, to Western
Europe, to the West, and finally]{.underline}, by December 1948,
**[to]{.underline}** the North Atlantic and **[NATO]{.underline}**. The
relatively sudden emergence of this \"North Atlantic\" focus
demonstrates that new regional identities can emerge quickly if suitable
material and ideational raw materials are available.

Considering the rapidity of this shift to a North Atlantic focus, it is
noteworthy that U.S. State Department officials insisted that the
signatories of the treaty did not invent the North Atlantic region. They
maintained instead [that the treaty merely codified a political
community that had been in existence for centuries and that provided the
basis for mutual identification]{.underline}. In the words of Dean
Acheson, NATO was \"the product of at least three hundred and fifty
years of history, perhaps more.\"74 Yet, for all the stress on the
reality and long history of the region, prior to 1948, with the
exception of a few references to the International Civil Aviation
Organization, State Department officials never talked about a North
Atlantic region. Like geography, history was not destiny.

The Origins of Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia as a particularly defined
region has also had a relatively brief history. Before World War II, the
region had been known by a number of different names. Some divided the
area into Chineseinfluenced Indochina, the Spanish-influenced
Philippines, and those areas strongly influenced by Indian culture.
Among European and U.S. diplomats, the region was often seen as an
extension of either China or India and referred to as \"further India,\"
\"greater India,\" \"Indo-China,\" or \"the Far Eastern tropics.\" The
popular term in Japan was \"Nan-yo\" (southern seas) and in China either
Nan-Yang or Kun-Lun (\"Little China\" or \"the lands of the Southern
Ocean\").75

The rise to prominence of the term \"Southeast Asia\" came with Japan\'s
occupation of the area during the Pacific War. The term emerged to
designate the areas south of China that fell to Japanese occupation.76
The private correspondence between Roosevelt and Churchill during World
War II reflects the gradual emergence of this regional designation. A
first mention came in early 1941 when Roosevelt wrote about Japan\'s
proposal to forgo any armed advance into the \"Southeastern Asiatic\"
area, provided the United States made a similar pledge. Roosevelt
further explained to Churchill that the U.S. response was to simply warn
Japan against taking any military moves in \"South-East Asia.\"77

After the United States entered the war and decided to concentrate first
on the European theater, discussion of the region faded. When attention
shifted back to the Asian theater, what to call this region remained
undecided. Churchill wrote in June 1943 that it was time for the Allies
to think more about \"the South East Asia (or Japan) front,\" and he
recommended the creation of a new command for that region. Later,
Churchill reiterated this call, but now denoted the envisioned entity as
\"a new command for East Asia.\" Here, practical political calculations
heavily influenced the naming process as Roosevelt rejected Churchill\'s
call for a unified East Asian command, arguing that creating such a
command would alienate Chiang Kai-shek, who controlled the China
theater. To avoid such an offense, Roosevelt moved the focus back to
\"South-East Asia.\" Churchill accepted Roosevelt\'s worries about
offending China and agreed that \"perhaps it would be desirable to give
the new command the title of \'South-East Asia\' instead of \'East
Asia\'.\"78 At the Quebec conference in August 1943, the United States
and Great Britain agreed to create a Southeast Asian Command (SEAC).
SEAC\'s area of responsibility corresponded roughly to what today is
conventionally called Southeast Asia.

After the victory of communist forces in China, the hands-off policy the
United States had adopted after the Pacific War shifted quickly. In
Andrew Rotter\'s words, the Truman administration \" \'discovered\'
Southeast Asia at the intersection of its policy toward China, Japan,
Great Britain, and France.\"79 Bolstering pro-Western forces in the
region could help contain China, restore Japan\'s economy, strengthen
Britain, and halt the bleeding of France. U.S. policy became
\"regionalized.\" \"American policy makers,\" writes Rotter, \"no longer
regarded Southeast Asia as a disparate jumble of unrelated states, but
as a region that had to be tied to the most important independent
nations of the Far East and Western Europe.\"80 SEATO, established in
September of 1954, should be seen as an extension of this
regionalization and the political attempt at tying the region to the
rest of the world. Only two of SEATO\'s members, Thailand and the
Philippines, were geographically part of Southeast Asia. The other six
members (Australia, France, Great Britain, New Zealand, Pakistan, and
the United States) came from outside the region.

The inclusion of France and Great Britain and, to a lesser extent,
Australia and New Zealand in SEATO raises a number of interesting
issues. In one sense, it shows the importance of a sense of identity in
forming alliances. As the United States endeavored to construct
alliances outside of Europe, it sought the cooperation of European
states even as European colonialism was collapsing in Asia. With Great
Britain and France in the alliance, however, why not work multilaterally
with them as the United States did with NATO? The answer to this
question points to the malleability of identity---a source of weakness
for explanations that focus only on identity. Looking to the post-war
world, Franklin Roosevelt initially had hoped to work with China rather
than European colonial powers, in bringing stability to Asia. When the
victory of communist forces in China made that course impossible, the
United States turned reluctantly to the European colonial powers as a
distinctly second-best solution. Here is one area where the U.S.
identification with its European allies broke down. The U.S. government
was unwilling to identify itself too closely with the colonial practices
of the European states in Asia; this limited the degree to which the
United States wanted to work multilaterally with the European states in
Asia. The pliability of this sense of identity---America is like the
Europeans in Europe, but not like the Europeans in Asia---shows the
limitations of explanations that focus only on collective identity and
underlines the advantages of eclectic explanations.

NATO and SEATO. Based on civilizational, ethnic, racial, and religious
ties as well as shared historical memories, identification with
Europeans rather than with the peoples of Southeast Asia was considered
to be quite natural. These different levels of mutual identification are
an important cause of the different institutional forms that the United
States favored for its alliances in Europe and Asia during the early
Cold War.

[One of the most striking aspects of]{.underline} the discussions
surrounding [the formation of NATO is the]{.underline} **[pervasive
identification of the United States with Europe]{.underline}**. This
aspect is exemplified by the strident assertion that the North Atlantic
already existed as a political community and that the treaty merely
formalized this pre-existing community of shared ideals and interest.81
In political debates in the United States, one found [constant
references to a]{.underline} \"**[common civilization,\"]{.underline}**
a \"community,\" [a]{.underline} **[shared \"spirit,\" \"like-minded
peoples,\" and \"common ideals.\"]{.underline}**82 As W. Averell
Harriman put it, \"[there is a]{.underline} **[spiritual
emotion]{.underline}** about this which is hard to emphasize . . . free
men are standing shoulder to shoulder.\"83 Even while criticizing the
Truman administration\'s overall policies, the columnist Walter Lippman
argued that [the members of the \"Atlantic Community\" are \"natural
allies of the United States.\" The \"nucleus\" of this
community]{.underline}, according to Lippman, is [\"distinct and
unmistakable\"]{.underline} based on geography, religion, and history.84
The rhetoric of the United States\' [European allies]{.underline}
similarly [referred to a \"spiritual confederation of the West,\"
protecting]{.underline} \"Western bastion\[s\],\" [\"the virtues and
values of our]{.underline} own [civilization,\"]{.underline} and how the
\"North Atlantic Community is a real commonwealth of nations which share
the same democratic and cultural traditions.\"85 [This sentiment found
ultimate expression in the]{.underline} **[preamble of the NATO
treaty]{.underline}**, **[which affirmed]{.underline}** the
**[determination]{.underline}** of the members \"**[to safeguard
the]{.underline}** freedom, **[common heritage and civilization of their
peoples]{.underline}**.\"

[Identification had an]{.underline} **[undeniable racial
component]{.underline}**. For example, former U.S. Assistant Secretary
of State Will Clayton hoped that NATO could be the first step in the
formation of an Atlantic Federal Union. In his testimony in support of
[NATO]{.underline}, Clayton explicitly linked his support of closer U.S.
and European relations to racial grounds in addition to cultural ones.
He argued that [\"]{.underline}my idea [would be]{.underline} that in
the beginning the union would be [composed of all countries that have
our ideas and ideals of freedom and that are composed of
the]{.underline} **[white race]{.underline}**.[\"]{.underline}86

In part because Americans identified strongly with Europeans, Europe was
also judged to be a strong ally. Indeed, [strong identification with
Europe led the United States to consistently give very high and
favorable estimates of the strength of its European
allies]{.underline}.87 Throughout the Cold War, U.S. officials
distinguished their NATO partners from other alliance members. [Europe
was seen as a]{.underline} \"**[center of world power]{.underline}**\"
populated by a \"vigorous\" people who had been powerful in the past and
would be again in the future.88 Looking [at]{.underline} what he called
[the]{.underline} \"**[great industrial complex of Western
Europe]{.underline}**,\" President Eisenhower believed that America\'s
Atlantic allies could not long remain intimidated by \"190 million
backward\" Russians. Speaking specifically about the Eisenhower
administration\'s plan to create a multilateral nuclear sharing
arrangement within NATO, Dulles argued that a unilateral U.S. nuclear
guarantee could not be \"a sound basis for a major country\'s security\"
and that he simply could not \"contemplate a situation in which there
were first and second class powers in NATO.\"89

The United States\' reaction to the formation of SEATO was very
different. U.S. debates show hardly a trace of identification, and
[there are no equivalent statements of shared ideals or future visions
of the Asian allies as great powers]{.underline}. Indeed, **[it is the
differences]{.underline}**, [not the commonalties]{.underline}, **[in
civilization, race, ethnicity, religion, and historical
memories]{.underline}** [that lead to the articulation of strong
doubts]{.underline} about the current and future strength of these
nations as parts [of an Asian alliance]{.underline}. Even as colonialism
was ending, **[the colonial mindset remained strong]{.underline}**. This
outlook stemmed in large part from the personal backgrounds of the men
who dominated the U.S. foreign policy machinery after World War II.
Drawn from elite New England prep schools, Ivy League universities, and
Wall Street businesses and law firms, the so-called \"Eastern
Establishment\" was then in its heyday. These men, alternating between
their private and public sector careers, switching positions \"like
lines in a hockey game changing on the fly,\" ventured into the
post-World War II world with a European and even an Atlantic bias.90
Having \"grown up and succeeded in a world marked by European power,
Third World weakness, and nearly ubiquitous racial segregation,\" they
could accept such distinctions between Europeans and others without
question.91 Interestingly, when these men attempted to explain what they
saw as the more alien and difficult to understand behavior of the Soviet
Union, [they invariably stressed the]{.underline} **[\"Asiatic\" or
\"Oriental\"]{.underline}** [nature of the regime]{.underline}.92 As
Senator James Eastland viewed the nascent Cold War, it was **[a struggle
between \"eastern and western civilization,\"]{.underline}** a battle
**[between]{.underline}** **[\"]{.underline}**the **[Oriental hordes and
a western civilization]{.underline}** 2,000 years
old.**[\"]{.underline}**93

A multilateral approach in Europe also allowed American politicians to
evade the potentially delicate challenge posed by different ethnic
voting blocs in the United States. With large numbers of Americans
tracing their ancestry to different European countries, attempting to
play favorites or to make distinctions among these states in American
foreign policy would be a risky strategy for elected politicians if
these distinctions upset significant ethnic voting blocs. By treating
all European allies the same, multilateralism offered a solution to what
could otherwise have been a tricky balancing act. Since Asian-American
voting blocs were less important during the early stages of the Cold
War, a similar electoral dilemma did not arise with regard to U.S.
foreign policy in Asia.94

There were, of course, segments in U.S. society that had more
interactions with and material interests in Asia than Europe.
Represented mostly by the midwestern and Pacific wings of the Republican
party, these individuals called for an \"Asiafirst\" strategy after
Pearl Harbor and continued to criticize U.S. foreign policy into the
Cold War for paying too little attention to Asia. Part of the attention
they gave to Asia was driven by their desire to criticize the
European-focused Eastern Establishment that dominated the Democratic
Party, the presidency, and the foreign policy apparatus of the U.S.
government. A large part of this attention, however, was also driven by
the commercial links Western businesses had forged across the Pacific
and the large number of American missionaries who had gone to Asia.95

Why did the preferences of American elites looking to Europe prevail
over those of the Asia-firsters? In keeping with our emphasis on the
need for eclectic explanations, we find that the answer lies in a
combination of identity and material factors. Identifying with Europe,
the Eastern Establishment not only had a preference for cooperating with
and focusing on Europe, it also controlled the institutional means of
power within the United States to implement such a foreign policy. The
European-firsters had political clout as \"the foreign policy center was
owned by the Establishment\... largely from the northeastern part of the
United States.\"96 And the United States had \"a tradition of selecting
foreign service officers from the Ivy League, and secretaries of state
and treasury from Wall Street.\"97 In addition, a large number of the
foreign service officers that did specialize in Asian affairs were
purged from the government as a result of the McCarthy Red Scare
following the fall of China.

Although represented by powerful figures on the American political
scene, like Senator Robert Taft of Ohio and publishing magnate Henry
Luce, himself the son of Asian missionaries, Asia-firsters were never as
influential as their Eastern Establishment rivals.98 Furthermore, the
opposition Republicans were split on the issue of a European versus an
Asian focus, with the northeastern wing of the party solidly in the
European-first camp and the midwestern wing of the party torn on the
issue. Indicative of this split is the well-noted conversion of Senator
Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan to support of Truman\'s foreign policy,
especially NATO. This conversion was, in part, a result of an
administration strategy, as Paul Nitze put it, \"to build up Senator
Vandenberg, as opposed to Senator Taft, and create a split within the
Republican Party, and to drive our policy in between these two
poles.\"99

This strategy was favored, no doubt, by the growing international
interests and the political influence of the auto industry centered in
Detroit.100 Eisenhower\'s victory over Taft in the Republican
presidential primaries in 1952 indicated and solidified the triumph of
the internationalist (and Europeanist) wing of the Republican party.

In explaining why one set of ideas triumphs over another, many analysts
have pointed to the importance of the \"fit\" between any particular
idea and the general ideological context, existing political
institutions, and pressing political concerns. As Mark Laffey and Jutta
Weldes note, however, fit does not simply exist; instead it is made by
political actors.101 Indeed, the stridency with which proponents of NATO
stressed a pre-existing community and common civilization can be seen as
part of a deliberate construction of \"fit,\" drawing on both identity
and material factors. A European strategy proved an easier sell to a
nation that saw itself as an offshoot of Europe and whose levers of
power were in the hands of men who identified closely with Europeans. In
addition, strong economic links between the United States and Europe
provided ample material incentives.

Although the European- and Asia-firsters disagreed over which region
more deserved American attention and resources, it is important to
stress that this disagreement did not involve a debate over multilateral
or bilateral forms of international cooperation that the United States
should adopt in these regions. This is most clear when one examines how
Asia-firsters thought about their preferred policy in Asia. Their
commitment to Asia did not extend to a willingness to pursue a
multilateral path in that region. Their interactions with Asians,
especially as part of Christian missionary work, did not lead to the
development of a sense of identity with Asian peoples that could serve
as a basis for a multilateral institution. The exact opposite occurred.
[Part of what made dealing with Asians rather than Europeans attractive
to Asia-firsters was the sense that]{.underline} **[backward Asians
could still be saved under American tutelage]{.underline}**.102 [Asians
were viewed as]{.underline} **[\"barbarian but
obedient,\"]{.underline}** [and Asia was thought of as \"a region of
vast resources and opportunities, populated by dutiful and cringing
peoples who followed white leadership.\"]{.underline} **[The goal was
not multilateral cooperation among equals]{.underline}** (or even
semi-equals), **[but one of unilateral U.S. dominance]{.underline}**.103
The case of the Asia-firsters demonstrates the indeterminacy of
arguments linking perceived interests and threats to particular
institutional forms without consideration of collective identity. Even
those Americans who saw U.S. interests more tied to Asia than to Europe,
and who believed that the Cold War would be fought and won in Asia, did
not reach for a multilateral framework for cooperation in this region.
The belief that Asians were not only foreign, but also inferior, helped
push these individuals to support unilateral or bilateral, rather than
multilateral, policies in Asia.

[When issues of identification, trust, and power arose with regard to
SEATO, they did so in the context of explaining why]{.underline}
**[Asian allies could not have, and did not deserve, the same
privileges]{.underline}** [that had been given to the European
allies]{.underline}. After signing a bilateral treaty with Japan, John
Foster Dulles explained that, [in the absence of identification, there
could be no Asian equivalent of NATO]{.underline}. At the same time,
however, he included Japan and the Philippines on the list of nations
with which the United States shared a common destiny.104 This indicates
both the diversity of sources and the varying strengths of U.S.
post-World War II identifications. Even though Japan and the Philippines
were situated outside of what Dulles saw as a Western \"community of
race, religion and political institutions,\" shared historical
experiences (the war and subsequent occupation of Japan and the
colonization of the Philippines) could provide some basis for
identification with particular Asian states. Identification is a matter
of degree, not an all-or-nothing proposition. If race, religion, and
shared political institutions helped to put the United States\' European
allies in a class ahead of its Asian allies, shared historical
experiences similarly helped put certain Asian allies ahead of others.

There is a strong note of condescension in many of the U.S. discussions
of SEATO; this condescension did not exist with regard to NATO. Many
**[American policymakers]{.underline}** [did not see Asians as ready or
sufficiently sophisticated to enjoy the trust and the same degree of
power that the United States had offered to European
states]{.underline}. In one particularly vulgar example, [in the context
of possible]{.underline} economic [aid to the Philippines, one U.S.
State Department official explained that the United States had to
closely supervise the use of such aid, because as he saw it, they \"were
only one generation out of the tree tops.\"]{.underline}105

The **[denigration of the importance of Asia]{.underline}** [and the
skill of Asians reached the highest levels in the U.S. State
Department]{.underline}. While Dean Acheson was secretary of state he
visited Europe at least eleven times, claiming at the same time to be
too busy to make even a single visit to East Asia. With the outbreak of
war on the Korean peninsula in June 1950, Acheson decided to actively
support U.S. involvement in the war primarily to demonstrate American
credibility to its new European allies. [With regard to the]{.underline}
later **[war in Vietnam]{.underline}**, Walt Rostow attributed
Acheson\'s eventual opposition to American involvement to the former
secretary of state\'s calculation that i[t was \"too much blood to spill
for those little people just out of the trees.\"]{.underline}106 Later
in his career, while reflecting on his overall approach to Asians,
Acheson maintained that \"I still cling to Bret Harte\'s aphorism,
[\'that for ways that are dark/And for tricks that are vain/**The
Heathen Chinese is peculiar**]{.underline}.\' But no more so than the
heathen Japanese.\"107 Acheson was hardly alone. An even blunter example
of America\'s condescension toward its potential allies in Asia can be
found in a State Department memo discussing the possibility of forming a
general Pacific Pact:

The plain fact is that any exclusive **[Western joint action in Asia
must carry with it the clear implication that we do not take the Asians
very seriously and in fact regard them as inferiors. We shall not be
able to avoid this implication because that is indeed our
attitude]{.underline}**.108

The [difference in identification and the different U.S. policies
followed in Asia]{.underline} and Europe after World War II [were not an
aberration]{.underline}. In many ways, [they were a continuation of U.S.
wartime attitudes that led to a \"Europe first\" strategy]{.underline};
the **[internment of Japanese-Americans]{.underline}**; a greater degree
of **[hatred regarding America\'s Asian enemies]{.underline}** (the
Japanese) as opposed to European opponents (usually the Nazis rather
than the Germans); and the basic decision, even before the war in Europe
was over, to use the **[atomic bomb against Japan]{.underline}** first,
not Germany.109 Indeed, as Michael Hunt has argued, [there is a long
tradition in **U.S. foreign policy**]{.underline} of **[dividing the
world into a racial hierarchy]{.underline}**, with the United States and
Great Britain at the top, followed by other European peoples, and
**[with Asians]{.underline}**, Latinos, and Africans further **[down the
list]{.underline}**.110 While overtly racial categories became less
prominent over time and have been replaced in U.S. rhetoric, in recent
decades, [with allusions to cultural and civilizational values, the
basic hierarchy has remained the same.]{.underline} The men in charge of
handling the United States\' post-World War II foreign policy were no
exceptions. Franklin [Roosevelt likened \"the brown people of the East\"
to \"minor children . . . who need trustees.\"]{.underline} Similarly,
Harry [Truman\'s private writings]{.underline} often lavished great
praise upon the British, while [speak]{.underline}ing [dismissively of
\"Chinamen\" and \"Japs.\"]{.underline} President Eisenhower placed
\"the English-speaking peoples of the world\" above all others. As one
of his advisers put it, \"[the Western world has]{.underline} somewhat
[more experience]{.underline} with the operations of war, peace, and
parliamentary procedure [than the swirling mess of **emotionally
super-charged**]{.underline} Africans and **[Asiatics]{.underline}** and
Arabs that outnumber us.\"1 \'\'

By virtue of its involvement in the eastern projection of these norms,
NATO is a particularly interesting case for a study on international
socialization. Thus, [what is involved here is the]{.underline}
**[role]{.underline}** [played by an international
institution]{.underline} **[in drawing the boundary]{.underline}**
[between]{.underline} **[acceptable]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[unacceptable modes of behavior]{.underline}**, and [establishing
legal and institutional arrangements that protect and reinforce
that]{.underline} **[symbolic boundary]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}
an area ([security]{.underline}) [conventionally regarded as key to the
survival and freedom of the state]{.underline}, and, hence, as the
exclusive domain of sovereign authorities.

As noted above, **[modern sovereignty]{.underline}** [works by affirming
an]{.underline} **[ontology of separation]{.underline}**, [of inclusion
and exclusion]{.underline} (inside and outside) [that enables a capacity
to draw the boundary between the normal and the exceptional, the
acceptable and the unacceptable in the life of the polity]{.underline}.
In the modern era, [a]{.underline} **[key power]{.underline}** [of the
state is the power to make a]{.underline} **[certain interpretation of
reality count]{.underline}**. Thus, [a key role in the production
of]{.underline} **[domestic order]{.underline}** [is played by
the]{.underline} **[reification of meaning]{.underline}** [through the
state's capacity to issue interpretations of reality]{.underline} that
are [recognized as]{.underline} **[legitimate]{.underline}** [by its
citizens]{.underline}. The [power to reify meaning involves not only the
capacity to define what is acceptable and unacceptable, but also to
implement that definition by embedding it in a **series of
laws**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[institutions]{.underline}**
[and by]{.underline} **[socializing citizens to take those categories
for granted]{.underline}**---in other words, by
[constructing]{.underline} the [common sense of citizens]{.underline}.
In that sense, [by virtue of its ability to make certain interpretations
of reality count, the modern state can be said to be the holder of
a]{.underline} **[monopoly of symbolic violence]{.underline}**.30

The [modern state produces official classifications of reality;
it]{.underline} **[produces]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[institutionalizes]{.underline}** [an]{.underline} **["official point
of view"]{.underline}** which performs several key functions in society.
To begin with, the official discourse [performs a
diagnostic]{.underline}, "an [act of knowledge that begets
recognition]{.underline}," and [that assigns]{.underline} **[particular
identities]{.underline}** to [individuals and defines the key
characteristics of different objects]{.underline}. Second, at the
administrative level, the [official discourse works via]{.underline}
rules and [prescriptions that instruct people what to do given who they
are]{.underline}. Finally, the official discourse also interprets and
records what people have actually done (e.g., via police records).31
[These classifications of reality are embedded in institutions
and]{.underline} **[reproduced through]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}
**[practices of individuals]{.underline}** [that have been socialized
into a particular set of dispositions for thinking and
acting]{.underline} (habitus) **[within the boundaries of the "official
point of view"]{.underline}** in different fields of society. In the
[long term]{.underline}, [habitus]{.underline}, which [is cultivated in
individuals through]{.underline} **[systematic pedagogic
practices]{.underline}**, [contributes to the]{.underline}
**[reproduction of a specific social order]{.underline}** [through
processes of]{.underline} **[self-censorship]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[self-limitation]{.underline}** [on the part of
individuals]{.underline}. Thus, [the system of meanings and
dispositions]{.underline} associated with a particular habitus [becomes
part of the]{.underline} **[taken-for-granted "rules of the
game"]{.underline}** by which everyone else in a given social context
acts. A group habitus has the effect of producing among those who share
it a "common-sense world, whose immediate self-evidence is accompanied
by the objectivity provided by consensus on the meaning of practices and
the world."32 In the context of liberal democratic societies, habitus is
especially important for maintaining and reproducing social order, for
the norms of democracy and extensive individual freedoms require the
formation of self-disciplined individuals able and willing to exercise
those freedoms in a "responsible" way which does not undermine the key
institutions of their society. As Mitchell Dean has explained,
"Liberalism is as much concerned with the appropriate normalizing
practices to shape the exercise of the citizens' political freedom as it
is with guaranteeing their rights and liberties."33

In most of the Central and Eastern European countries, the
**[revolutions of 1989]{.underline}** [brought about]{.underline} a
[breakdown of old structures of authority and]{.underline}
de-legitimized the Communist "official point of view" and the
institutions in which that point of view was embedded. In turn, this
[led to]{.underline} **[debates]{.underline}** and political struggles
**[over the redefinition of reality]{.underline}**, as various groups
sought to make different interpretations of reality count. As we shall
see in Chapters 4 and 5, while it might be tempting to think that the
Central and Eastern Europeans simply adopted Western norms and rules and
built a new official discourse around those norms, the situation was
more ambiguous, not least because in the post--Cold War era there
persisted numerous---and fairly strong---groups, in particular,
[Communists]{.underline} and nationalists, who [refused to identify with
the values and institutions of the West and put forward different
interpretations of the identity of their countries]{.underline}. On that
basis, [they proposed]{.underline} [**different symbolic boundaries**
between the normal and the exceptional]{.underline}, the [acceptable and
unacceptable]{.underline} ways of governing their polity, gave different
[diagnostics of]{.underline} the [problems, priorities, aims, and
strategies]{.underline} of post-Communist reconstruction, and provided
different interpretations of the "normal" relationships of their
countries with the outside world. Moreover, even the groups and parties
that advocated the construction of liberal democratic polities often
defined liberal democracy in ways that were [seen as]{.underline}
**[incorrect]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[unacceptable
by]{.underline}** the **[NATO]{.underline}** allies.

In that context of fluidity, [NATO became involved in
re-constituting]{.underline} Central and Eastern European polities
through its efforts of promoting a [liberal democratic set of
classifications of reality, involving a]{.underline} particular,
**[Western-defined boundary]{.underline}** [between acceptable and
unacceptable modes of thinking and acting]{.underline}, elevating those
classifications to the status of the "official point of view" and
building new legal and institutional arrangements aimed at protecting
and reproducing it. This systematic involvement in the (re)construction
of Central and East European polities was facilitated by the fact that
many pro-liberal elites in the former Communist bloc recognized NATO as
a key institution of the Western community with which they identified,
and, as such, as an authoritative, trustworthy source of expertise in
the area of security. NATO carried out systematic practices of
socialization of Central and Eastern European elites and societal actors
into a particular set of norms associated with the liberal democratic
identity, guiding them in the process of institutionalizing those norms,
and helping them gain precedence over alternative (nationalist and
communist) norms put forward by different domestic groups. In essence,
NATO has played an important role in crafting liberal democratic
polities in the former Eastern Bloc of Europe.

There were [several types of socialization
practices]{.underline}---teaching, **[persuasion]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[role-playing]{.underline}**---that
**[play]{.underline}**ed [**important roles** in the process of
international state-crafting carried out by NATO]{.underline}. Although
it is useful to treat these as analytically distinct categories, it is
also important to pay attention to the ways in which [they often overlap
in practice]{.underline}. Chapter 3 explains the meaning and dynamics of
those types of socialization practices, and Chapters 4 and 5 examine
their actual application and effects in post--Cold War interactions
between NATO and Central and Eastern Europeans. As we shall see, in many
cases---though not always---those [practices of socialization did affect
definitions of state identity and interests held by]{.underline} Central
and Eastern European [socializees]{.underline}.

In this book, state identities refer to prevailing national ideas of
collective distinctiveness and purpose.34 [These ideas]{.underline}, by
defining the key characteristics of a given polity,
**[shape]{.underline}** [both]{.underline} its **[domestic
politics]{.underline}** (since they are [tied to a particular set of
norms and principles of governance]{.underline} that are recognized as
consistent with "who we are") [and]{.underline} its **[foreign
policy]{.underline}** (since [through an identification of national
distinctiveness vis-à-vis other states in the international
system]{.underline}, definitions of state identity position the self
relative to other countries and enable decision makers to identify
friends and enemies in the international arena). Useful **[indicators of
change]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} the definition of [national
identity include the emergence of]{.underline} **[new intersubjective
ideas]{.underline}** [about the key characteristics of the given
polity]{.underline} [(e.g.,]{.underline} **[new understandings of the
collective self]{.underline}**, the [purpose of its basic institutions,
and]{.underline} the [nature of "correct" norms of
governance)]{.underline} [and a new conception of the **relationship
between**]{.underline} [the national]{.underline} **[self]{.underline}**
[and the]{.underline} **[outside world]{.underline}** (such as a
rearticulation of the self's particular position---identification with,
similarity to, difference from, or even opposition to various
international others, and the purpose of the self in the context of
interactions with those different others).

**Role-playing frameworks [literally brainwash]{.underline} us into
adopting Western norms\-\--[social psychology]{.underline}.**

**[Role-playing]{.underline}**, I suggest, [can be seen as part of
a]{.underline} **[process of habitus-building]{.underline}**, for, as
Bourdieu explained, habitus is not simply a set of conceptual
categories. Rather, [as a set of dispositions which are acquired through
a process of]{.underline} **[inculcation]{.underline}** [that incline
agents to act and react in certain ways, habitus refers to a whole set
of relations to the world, from conceptual frameworks]{.underline}, to
bodily expressions (bodily hexis, incorporating specific ways of
speaking, moving, etc.), [to behavioral dispositions]{.underline} and
ethical principles. The [acquisition of **new behavioral
dispositions**]{.underline}--- in this case, I argue, **[via
role-playing]{.underline}**---[is an important part of the socialization
of individuals into the]{.underline} culture of a [given
community]{.underline} or social group. As Bourdieu argued, the
[behavioral dispositions inculcated in people lead them to **act or
react in specific ways**---as if those ways were simply
natural]{.underline}. In his examination of Bourdieu's habitus, John
Thompson pointed out that [it is]{.underline} "[because the body has
become a repository of **ingrained dispositions** that certain actions,
certain ways of behaving and responding, seem altogether
natural.]{.underline}"42

[**Social psychologists** have long argued that role-playing is one of
the most effective ways through which society influences the
**behavior**]{.underline}, but ultimately also the
**[attitudes]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[self-images]{.underline}** [of its members]{.underline}.43 According
to analysts [of religious conversion, for instance, people often "act
themselves" into roles prescribed by particular religious
beliefs]{.underline}.44 The [explanation provided by social
psychologists is that individuals' own behavior will be used by them as
a source of evidence of their beliefs and attitudes.]{.underline}
[By]{.underline} **[engaging in activities]{.underline}** typically
**[associated with a certain]{.underline}** social
**[role]{.underline}**, [people will come to identify with the role and
will tend to accept the "duties" and appropriate norms of behavior
prescribed for that role.]{.underline}

A [surprising finding of social psychology is that even people whose
initial worldview is in tension with the ideas underlying the roles they
enact may, in the aftermath of role-playing, **change the way in which
they perceive** themselves and understand others]{.underline}. For
instance, marriage counselors and mediators in labor-management disputes
commonly advise parties to a dispute to play the role of those with whom
they are in conflict. The idea is that, [by doing the things that other
actors habitually do, participants in role-playing will change their
perceptions of those others, and, on this basis, also **re-evaluate
themselves**]{.underline}.45

Although, to date, theorists of world politics have not shown great
interest in it, I suggest that [role-playing plays an interesting role
in **international socialization**]{.underline} practices. In our case,
we can talk of the [occurrence of **role-playing** in]{.underline}
situations in which **[NATO]{.underline}** places Central and Eastern
European actors in positions [in which they have to act as if they were
members of the alliance, emulating allied attitudes and behavior,
performing the tasks that allied officers and civilian officials are
expected to carry out]{.underline}. In the case of post--Cold War NATO,
a **[close analysis]{.underline}** [of activities involving Central and
Eastern European actors]{.underline}---particularly young military and
civilian experts---[reveals a]{.underline} **[repeated
use]{.underline}** [of role-playing aimed at conveying to those actors
the]{.underline} [**"Western way of doing things"** in]{.underline}
civil-military relations and, more broadly, in **[security-related
matters]{.underline}**. Particularly in the context of Partnership for
Peace (PfP) courses, IFOR and KFOR operations in the Balkans, and NATO's
Parliamentary Assembly seminars, Central/Eastern Europeans were required
to adopt actively the role of liberal democratic decision makers or
military officers. **[Role-playing]{.underline}** enacted in the
**[framework]{.underline}** of PfP programs was [carried out in pursuit
of NATO's goal of extending]{.underline} "to others in Europe what NATO
has achieved among its member nations---a [common defense
culture]{.underline} and the elimination of war as an accepted
instrument of national policy."46 Indeed, organizers of PfP courses and
other programs pointed out that they placed [special emphasis on
cultivating]{.underline} in partners the kind of [behavior associated
with the NATO way of doing things]{.underline}, and "[eventually
establishing the same kind of habits of cooperation]{.underline} with
partners that have long existed among the allies."47

[Role-playing exercises often occur]{.underline}red [in the context
of]{.underline} **[simulated crises]{.underline}** [or other
situations]{.underline} **[calling for extensive
cooperation]{.underline}** [between]{.underline} political and [military
authorities]{.underline}, and between those authorities and society.
Typically, Central/Eastern European socializees were asked to (pretend
to) make decisions and act in accordance with liberal democratic
principles of the rule of law, democratic control of security/defense
institutions, and respect for the basic human rights of the individuals
involved in, or affected by, the presumed "crises." For instance, they
were asked to emulate their Western peers in finding and implementing
solutions that respected a constitutional framework of inviolable
liberal rights of civilians (as opposed to, for instance, arbitrary
suspension of the right to freedom and property). Such
[instances]{.underline} of role-playing were [designed to
cultivate]{.underline} in Central/Eastern European socializees
[the]{.underline} **[habit]{.underline}** [of acting in accordance with
**Western-prescribed norms**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}, hence,
indirectly, [to cultivate in them the]{.underline} **["right"
dispositions]{.underline}** [in terms of normative
references]{.underline} used as guidelines in decision-making and
implementation. I suggested earlier that, to the extent that
socialization is effective, [it will lead socializees to]{.underline}
**[internalize]{.underline}** the [**new norms**---that is, to take them
for granted, regard compliance with them as the right thing to do, and
**reject alternative norms** as unacceptable]{.underline}. From this
(constructivist) perspective, [norm internalization means that the
socializees will]{.underline} **[(re)define their
identity]{.underline}** [and interests in accordance to those norms, and
will **reject** interpretations of interests that involve **violations**
of those norms]{.underline}.48 If the new norms have been internalized,
the [socializees will uphold them consistently]{.underline}, in various
forums and in diverse circumstances, [even at the risk of incurring
material costs. They will promote the new norms as the right thing to
do, rather than engage in a cost-benefit analysis in each decisionmaking
instance in order to decide whether or not a certain norm should be
accepted or rejected]{.underline}---which is what they should do if they
were no more than strategic manipulators of those norms.

In their recent work, constructivist scholars like Jeffrey Checkel and
Thomas Risse point out that persuasion is more successful when the
actors involved act within the framework of a Habermasian "common
lifeworld," consisting of a shared system of understandings and norms
perceived as legitimate.34 This is an important finding. But I suggest
that, [particularly]{.underline} **[in situations when]{.underline}**
"**[novices]{.underline}**" **[are involved]{.underline}**, [it is
useful to start analyses of international socialization at an earlier
stage---]{.underline}that [in which socializees are brought into a given
cultural framework]{.underline}. In the context of the present study,
[NATO-sponsored persuasion complemented]{.underline}---and sometimes
relied on---**[pedagogical practices]{.underline}** [through which
representatives of the organization sought to]{.underline} teach Central
and Eastern Europeans [a particular set of]{.underline} (**[Western
defined]{.underline}**) **[ideas, norms, and principles]{.underline}**.
From this perspective, [teaching can be seen as an attempt
to]{.underline} **[project]{.underline}** into Central and Eastern
Europe [the]{.underline} **[common lifeworld]{.underline}** [of the
Euro-Atlantic community, consisting of shared liberal ideas and
norms]{.underline}.35 If successful, this [pedagogic effort will lead
to]{.underline} a situation in which Central/Eastern Europeans come to
share the [collective interpretations of the world]{.underline}, and of
legitimate norms and rules that prevail among NATO's members. In turn,
this should [facilitate]{.underline} **[subsequent
arguing]{.underline}** between NATO members and Central/Eastern European
partners, [by providing]{.underline} them with [a repertoire of
collective understandings within which they can]{.underline}
**[articulate truth claims.]{.underline}** I argue that, particularly in
interactions with pro-reform Czech and Romanian political elites, NATO
officials often sought to teach liberal norms, then tried to persuade
socializees to enact particular institutional and legislative reforms by
portraying those reforms as the right way of translating the new norms
into practice.
