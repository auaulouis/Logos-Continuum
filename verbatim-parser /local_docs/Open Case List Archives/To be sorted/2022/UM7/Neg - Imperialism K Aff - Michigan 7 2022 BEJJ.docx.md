A[s NATO moves towards the future, it finds itself confronting the
challenges of a changing world]{.underline}. As noted in the NATO2030
process (Maizière et al., 2020; NATO, 2021a), [[NATO will need to
address]{.mark} a host of returning and emergent challenges such as
**[Russia's aggressive actions]{.mark}**, the threat of terrorism,
cyber-attacks, emerging and disruptive technologies, the security impact
of climate change, and the rise of Chin]{.underline}a. The solutions to
these challenges require a delicate blend of political and military
action married with the deep collective wisdom contained within the
Alliance. Within the three core missions specified by NATO's 2010
strategic concept (collective defence, crisis management and cooperative
security) (NATO, 2020d), [**[the Alliance is focused on]{.mark}** five
operational imperatives: [cognitive superiority]{.mark}]{.underline},
layered resilience, influence and power projection, cross-domain
command, and integrated multi-domain defence (NATO, 2021c). These
imperatives and the overarching challenges outlined in NATO2030 have led
NATO to expand its operational domains from three (air, land, sea) to
include cyber (NATO, 2019) and space (NATO, 2021b). However, a school of
thought exists that has strongly advocated that the cognitive domain
should be given equal importance and noting that it is an area where
Alliance nations are particularly vulnerable (Cole & Le Guyader, 2020).
Recent examples of the ever-growing threat presented by [disinformation,
misinformation, and propaganda, including actions taken during the
COVID-19 crisis, would support such an assertion.]{.underline} It is
worthwhile at this point to clarify the definitions necessary to
consider conflict in the cognitive domai[n. First, misinformation may be
taken to mean the creation and dissemination of false and/or manipulated
information, without malicious intent. Similarly,weaponised
misinformation, otherwise known as disinformation, is defined by NATO as
"the deliberate creation and dissemination of false and/or manipulated
information with the intent to deceive and/or mislead"]{.underline}
(NATO, 2020b). The key distinguishing difference between the two is that
disseminating disinformation is an act conducted with malice and
forethought. The organised dissemination of disinformation is often
called a disinformation campaign, which may also mix in selected facts
so as to obscure or confuse. On the other hand, propaganda disseminates
information or narratives that may be factual, false, highly selected or
manipulated in nature but are intended to put a country or social group
in a particular light (positive or negative) or influence opinion. More
succinctly, it is information with an agenda (DiResta, 2018). The more
insidious modern form, computational propaganda, is defined as "the
assemblage of social media platforms, autonomous agents, and big data
tasked with the manipulation of public opinion" (Woolley, 2016). The
employment of computational disinformation has meant that the costs of
creating a disruptive disinformation campaign have significantly been
reduced, along with a dramatic increase in effectiveness, focus and
agility. **[[Information warfare has always been part of organized
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}** (e.g., Tzu, 2018). Nevertheless, a more
modern definition, drawn from Russian doctrine, definesinformation
warfare (or operations) "\[as the\] conscious employment of information
to enable the user to achieve his political, economic, military, or
other goals ... \[to be\] conducted constantly, in peacetime, in the
period of threats ... and in wartime ... \[by\] committing all available
forces and software and hardware potentialities to impact the opponent's
information capabilities and protect our own against similar actions by
the opponent" (Ball, 2017). [[Information warfare]{.mark} is not about
armed forces, equipment or infrastructure in the physical domain but
rather a part of a strategic campaign to **[influence, affect
perceptions, and validate realities]{.mark}** that support national
power agendas (Carr, 2019). In US doctrine information warfare consists
of five aspects: electronic warfare, computer network operations,
PsyOps]{.underline} (psychological operations), military deception, and
operational security (Bernal et al., 2020). More concisely,
"**[[information warfare works to control the flow of
information]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (Bernal et al., 2020; Cluzel, 2020).
One of the critical challenges of defensive information warfare is to
recognise when an attack is occurring (Nimmo, 2016) and to act
accordingly. In addition, defensive information warfare may also be used
as a means of developing a narrative to inoculate one's citizens against
an actual or perceived information attack (Dumitrescu, 2019). Narratives
are stories about stories (Verdon, 2019). Beliefs, history, information,
disinformation, misinformation, propaganda and mythmaking are all part
of the development of a strategic narrative defined as "a means for
political actors to construct a shared meaning of the past, present, and
future of international politics to shape the behaviour of domestic and
international actors. Strategic narratives are a tool for political
actors to extend their influence, manage expectations, and change the
discursive environment in which they operate. They are narratives about
bothstates and the system itself, both about who we are and what kind of
order we want. The point of strategic narratives is to influence the
behaviour of others" (O'Loughlin et al., 2013). [[Strategic
narratives]{.mark} are a double-edged sword, [playi]{.mark}ng [a role in
societies]{.mark} as tools for defensive information
warfare]{.underline} (potentially based on disinformation) or **[[as a
means of increasing social resilience to cognitive
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Dumitrescu, 2019). Cognitive warfare is
a generalisation and extension of information warfare beyond the
battlefield. It is best defined as an attack on knowledge, or more
clearly, it is a means of conflict designed to impact how individuals,
groups or nations think about an issue, event or situation. Ultimately,
"destabilisation and influence are the fundamental goals of cognitive
warfare" (Cluzel, 2020). The difference between information and
cognitive warfare is significant (Bienvenue et al., 2018). It lies in
the process of turning information into knowledge, as per the first two
steps of the OODA loop (Osinga, 2005). In cognitive warfare, the weapon
is information, but the domain of operation is cognitive. Cognitive
warfare is part of the larger concepts of grey zone or hybrid warfare.
Grey zone warfare describes conflict conducted below the level of
engagement that could initiate traditional military actions. "The Gray
Zone is characterised by intense political, economic, informational, and
military competition more fervent in nature than normal steady-state
diplomacy, yet short of conventional war" (Votel et al., 2016), with the
Cold War being the quintessential example. NATO considers hybrid warfare
as "a wide range of overt and covert military, paramilitary, and
civilian measures ... employed in a highly integrated design" (Hoffman,
2018). This definition describes the use of mixed military-political
tools of conflict used within the grey zone of operations. NATO nations
have recognised the threat of hybrid and grey zone conflict. At the 2018
Brussels Summit, heads of state noted that ["We face hybrid challenges,
including disinformation campaigns and malicious cyber
activities."]{.underline} This was followed up in 2019 at the London
Summit with heads of state noting that NATO will be "strengthening
\[its\] ability to prepare for, deter, and defend against hybrid tactics
that seek to undermine our security and societies", a point reinforced
once again at the 2021 NATO summit in Brussels. [In the intervening
years, **[NATO has developed a clear strategy to counter
disinformation]{.mark}** based on promulgating factual narratives.
[Disinformation is countered by offering a counter-narrative built on
refuting, debunking, providing relevant facts]{.mark} and sources, and
supporting the actions of a free press]{.underline}. Alliance nations
share best practices, approaches, lessons learned, and insights among
themselves and partners such as the EU and UN. This counter
disinformation strategy includes continued research in disinformation
methods and grey-zone tactics. NATO S&T has played a vital role in
supporting NATO efforts to understand better and counter disinformation,
whether through the Science for Peace and Security Program, working with
partner nations, or through the collaborative efforts of the Science and
Technology Organization. The COVID-19 pandemic is not a consequence of
geostrategic conflict. Nevertheless, the pandemic has had a direct and
adverse effect on all Alliance nations, particularly their medical,
political, and economic systems. Exploiting this crisis, several
countries and groups with partisan agendas attempted to create a
watershed moment in global security by undermining Alliance cohesion and
national resolve. As noted by the World Health Organization's (WHO)
Director-General at the 2020 Munich Security Conference, "We're not just
fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic" (Zarocostas, 2020).
The COVID-19 pandemic presented an information exploitation opportunity
for some strategic actors as part of existing grey zone conflicts. At
the same time, this has raised awareness of the enduring challenge of
countering misinformation, disinformation and outright propaganda. These
attacks can, and have, imposed considerable costs to the nations and has
needlessly increased the death rate from COVID-19. However, in any
complex crisis, such as that experienced during pandemics, information
transparency and open communication builds trust and ultimately saves
lives. Over the initial phases of the COVID-19 crises, Russian
disinformation campaigns focused on stories such as (EEAS, 2021):
COVID-19 was developed in NATO laboratories, global elites are imposing
tyranny, and the EU is disintegrating. As time went on, these attacks
expanded to include those designed to increase doubt on vaccine
efficacy, safety and availability, accusing countries of genocide for
not using the Russian vaccine (Sputnik V), suggesting that migrants (or
NATO) have been spreading the virus across Europe, as well as implying
that degenerate geopolitical and commercial interests were over-riding
the interests of European and North American citizens. While some of
these attacks are homegrown, there has also been a trend towards
amplifying attacks from secondary sources (e.g., right & left-wing
groups, Iran, ISIS, China, anti-vaxxers, etc.). This approach maintains
a veneer of plausible deniability and evades responsibility for accurate
reporting. At the same time, these efforts have presented an inflated
narrative of Russian (and to some extent Chinese) generosity and
scientific, military and societal strength. This narrative was supported
by logistics and medical support provided to groups with deep historical
and linguistic ties to Russia or Kremlin-friendly forces (Ozawa, 2020).
In late April of 2020, Russia launched three harmonised disinformation
attacks on NATO (NATO, 2020b). First, a fake letter was published,
purportedly from Jen Stoltenberg, NATO's Secretary-General, to Raimundus
Karoblis, Lithuania's Minister of Defence. The letter noted that NATO
had decided to withdraw its multinational battlegroup from Lithuania due
to rising COVID-19 infections. The letters were posted on blogs in
English and Lithuanian and were later picked up by various websites and
social media platforms. Fake accounts, created days before, were used to
spread the disinformation further. Following this, an edited YouTube
video was released suggesting that COVID-19 within the multinational
battlegroup was the single agenda item for a recent NATO Defence
Ministers meeting. Finally, the letter was sent directly to NATO
Headquarters via a spoofed NATO e-mail address. Surprisingly, given the
care taken to orchestrate this attack, the letter contained many
formatting, structural and grammatical mistakes, and was recognized
quickly as a fake. Ultimately the attack was a failure and died out
quickly. NATO responded rapidly to discredit the story, as did the
Lithuanian Defence Ministry. Early identification (understand) and rapid
reaction (engage) nullified the attack. As noted by the
Secretary-General, "They have not been successful because, first of all,
it has been clearly revealed that this is a fake letter; secondly, we've
seen that NATO allies remain committed, remain united, and are actually
helping each other in the midst of the coronavirus crisis" (NATO,
2020b). Disinformation has been a constant threat to the Alliance since
its inception. Nevertheless, with the increased use of asymmetric
(hybrid) warfare and the attendant growth of social media,
disinformation and its institutional twin of propaganda have
significantly increased in volume and precision. Moreover, these efforts
are part of more significant military and geopolitical trends, such as
those presented by hybrid or grey zone warfare, where **[[success is
defined through operations in the cognitive
sphere.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### The AFF has misconstrued cognitive warfare, cognitive warfare is both necessary and useful.

[[NATO has shown that we remain ready and able to defend our
nations,]{.underline}]{.mark} that allies and partners are supporting
each other, and that investing in our Armed Forces is an investment in
the strength and resilience of our societies. This readiness was
demonstrated in no uncertain terms by our Alliance's vital role in
fighting this deadly pandemic. This [[**capacity stretches across**
the]{.mark} maritime, land, air, cyber, and space domains, as well as
the information or **[cognitive sphere.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Taken
together, **[[this will help us build the resilience of our
societies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and building resilience in our
communities requires a whole-of-society approach. Everyone has a role to
play; the media, the private sector, academia, civil society, of course,
the whole-of-government. But it also includes all the relevant groups in
our communities to ensure that our institutions and citizens are
equipped for today's digital realities. Beyond the nations that make up
the Alliance, [we must work in concert with our partners to strengthen
our collective ability to prevent crisis and address
challenges.]{.underline} It is clear that no nation alone, no continent
alone, can cope with the magnitude of the challenges we are now facing
as democratic societies. [[NATO is about]{.mark} security, but it's also
about values, **[shared values]{.mark}**, and shared
interests]{.underline}. This Alliance is about freedom, and I think our
nations, especially those coming from behind the Iron Curtain,
appreciate that strong narrative. To ensure our success and resilience
in the face of adversity, we must unambiguously and proactively
communicate our core narrative, intent and actions to our publics, our
potential rivals, and adversaries. But the pandemic also showed us that
resilience is a whole-of-society concern. But [[to correctly assess this
societal resilience, we need better to understand the]{.mark} nature,
diffusion and **[power of disinformation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. With
this understanding, we may define even more precise indicators, metrics,
and analytics to help Allied nations cope. Leveraging modern research in
social and information sciences will support this work. This book will
play a small but essential part in building such resilience,
representing a whole-of-society perspective including academia,
industry, and NATO scientists. But it also crucial to understand that
the speed of innovation and technology implementation and how this might
change operations across the operational domains, including the
information sphere. Understanding how current and future developments of
emerging disruptive technologies (EDTs) will impact these domains of
operation will be essential to our operational success. We will need to
harness the research, technological and analytical talent in our
societies. Bring our universities together, bring our scientists
together, bring our top experts, and embed our values and ethical and
moral code in our technologies. If we succeed, and I'm very confident
that we will, we will maintain our edge and keep our societies safe and
resilient. And that is the concept of NATO. It is not only strong
together dedicated to looking forward, introducing [innovation,
understanding the realities and technologies of today, countering
disinformation and propaganda, bringing together the best of our
scientific and technological base.]{.underline} I think all our citizens
are and will continue to be safer because of that. This book captures
and contributes to the collaborative effort of the nations which make up
the Alliance and its partners. **[[It promotes a shared understanding of
the information sphere,]{.mark}]{.underline}** outlines the attempts to
undermine the Alliance during the COVID-19 pandemic, and contextualizes
the hazards of disinformation and propaganda. It will guide our travels
through and competition for ideas within the information sphere as we
evolve as an Alliance.
