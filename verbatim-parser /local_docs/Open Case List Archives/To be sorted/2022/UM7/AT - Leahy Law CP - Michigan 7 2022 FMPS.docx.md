### 2ac -- at: courts ban the plan

#### CP's [struck down]{.underline} -- Leahy Law suits are [virtually impossible]{.underline} -- [sovereign immunity]{.underline}, [political question]{.underline}, OR [standing doctrine]{.underline} causes [dismissal]{.underline} OR [non-enforcement]{.underline} -- NO spillover

and the Consequences.\" Cornell International Law Journal, 45, 667, pp.

VIII\. Judicial Barriers to Enforcement

In a series of decisions, [the **Supreme [Court]{.mark}** has [made
it]{.mark} **virtually [impossible]{.mark}** for anyone [to **sue** to
**enforce**]{.mark} the **[Leahy Law]{.mark}**. Any challenge to the
Leahy Law is likely to **fail** because of **sovereign
immunity**]{.underline}, 249 [because **enforcement** is a **political
question**]{.underline}, 250 [or because any conceivable **plaintiffs**
would **lack standing**]{.underline}. 251

[[Iran-Contra]{.mark} presents a good indication of what would
happen]{.underline} if foreign citizens tried challenging the Leahy Law.
In Sanchez-Espinoza v. Reagan, when twelve citizens of Nicaragua sued
for redress of injuries to themselves by the Contras, then-Circuit Judge
Antonin [Scalia **[barred]{.mark} the complaint** [on **sovereign
immunity**]{.mark} grounds.]{.underline} 252 Scalia said:

[It would make a **mockery** of the **doctrine** of **sovereign
immunity** if **federal courts** were **authorized** to **sanction** or
**enjoin**, by judgments nominally against **present** or **former**
**Exec**utive **officers**]{.underline}, actions that are, concededly
and as a jurisdictional necessity, official actions of the United
States. Such judgments would necessarily \"interfere with the public
administration,\" or \"restrain the government from acting, or ...
compel it to act.\" These consequences are tolerated when the officer\'s
action is unauthorized because contrary to statutory or constitutional
prescription, but we think that exception can have no application when
the basis for jurisdiction requires action authorized by the sovereign
as opposed to private wrongdoing... .

... The support for military operations that we are asked to terminate
has, if the allegations in the complaint are accepted as true, received
the attention and approval of the President, the Secretary of State, the
Secretary of Defense, and the Director of the CIA, and involves the
conduct of our diplomatic relations with at least four foreign states
... . 253

More recently, [in **Arar v. [Ashcroft]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the
**[Second Circuit]{.underline}** said that it \"has [[recognized]{.mark}
\'the generally accepted view that [foreign policy was]{.mark} the
province and [responsibility of]{.mark} the
**[Exec]{.mark}utive**]{.underline} ... . [Thus, **unless Congress**
specifically has **provided otherwise**, courts traditionally have been
**reluctant** to **intrude** upon the **authority** of the **Executive**
in **military** and national security **affairs**]{.underline}.\'\" 254

Moreover, [in [Goldwater]{.mark} v. Carter, the Supreme [Court
ruled]{.mark} that the [**authority** to **terminate treaties**
is]{.mark} a [**political question** and]{.mark} therefore
**[non-justiciable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 255 In his concurrence,
Justice Powell said \"[the Judicial Branch **should not decide** issues
affecting the allocation of power between the President and Congress
until the political branches reach a constitutional
impasse]{.underline}.\" 256 [While there have been **[systemic
flaws]{.mark}** that [lead to]{.mark} the **[lack of
enforcement]{.mark}** of the **Leahy Law**, given [the **deference** to
the **Exec**]{.mark}**utive** on matters of **foreign policy**, it is
**highly unlikely** to lead to a **constitutional
impasse**]{.underline}.

[[Nor do]{.mark} Members of [Congress have **standing**]{.mark} to
**sue**. In **[Raines]{.mark} v. Byrd**, the **Supreme Court
[denied]{.mark}** Members of **[Congress]{.mark}** the [**ability**
to]{.mark} **challenge laws** based upon a **diminution** of
**congressional power**]{.underline}. 257 The Court said that,
\"appellees have alleged no injury to themselves as individuals, the
[institutional injury they allege is wholly **abstract** and **widely
dispersed**, and their attempt to **[litigate]{.mark} this dispute** at
this time and in this form is contrary to historical
experience]{.underline}.\" 258

[With respect to the Leahy Law itself, a **[District
Court]{.mark}**]{.underline} gave two reasons in
**[[deny]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing Representative Kucinich\'s
**[[suit]{.underline}]{.mark}** to stop U.S. military action in Libya
[that **cut against** any **congressional suits** [to]{.mark} enforce
the **[Leahy Law]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The first was the ability of
the legislators to seek a **legislative remedy**,]{.underline} 259 [and
the second was **congressional action**]{.underline}, 260 in this case
voting against de-funding the Libyan intervention. [Since a
**legislative remedy** to a **lack** of **enforcement** of the **Leahy
Law** is **theoretically available** and there have been **successive
appropriations bills** passed that have had the effect of funding the
military units at issue, it is **[highly]{.mark} [unlikely]{.mark}**
that a [suit brought by]{.mark} Members of [**Congress** will
**survive** a **challenge**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Due to the **difficulty** in **tracking FMF**]{.underline} to a
particular unit, [and]{.underline} therefore the [[impossibility of
demonstrating]{.mark} that the U.S. arms and training were the cause of
a **[specific injury]{.mark}**, it is similarly **[unlikely]{.mark}**
that **[other]{.mark}** groups of [**plaintiffs** will have
**standing**]{.mark} **to sue**]{.underline}. The [Supreme Court ruled,
in **Schlesinger** v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, that unless
a citizen has been personally injured \"**standing** to sue may not be
predicated upon an interest ... which is held in common by all members
of the public, because of the **necessarily abstract** nature of the
injury all citizens share]{.underline}.\" 261 Further, in United States
v. Richardson, the Supreme Court ruled that taxpayers did not have
standing to sue because \"[to **invoke judicial power** the claimant
must have a **\'personal stake** in the outcome,\' or a
**\'particular**, **concrete injury**,\' or \'a **direct injury**,\' in
short, something more than \'generalized grievances]{.underline}.\'\"
262 However, [the [**possibility** of]{.mark} any [**plaintiff**
meeting]{.mark} these [**requirements** is **de
minimis**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Due to sovereign immunity and the political question and standing
doctrines, the [[Judiciary **cannot check**]{.mark} presidential
[**violations** of the **Leahy Law**]{.mark}. Without
**Congress**]{.underline} clearly articulating a cause of action, the
[courts will [continue to **bar**]{.mark} any potential
**[plaintiffs]{.mark}** from **seeking** a **judicial
remedy**]{.underline}. It is up to Congress, not the courts, to give
strength to the Leahy Law.

FIRST IN NATSEC DAILY --- LEAHY LAW LOOPHOLE: Rep. SARA
**[JACOBS]{.underline}** (D-Calif.) [and]{.underline} Sen.
**[CHRIS]{.underline}** VAN HOLLEN (D-Md.) [have introduced the
"Upholding Human Rights Abroad Act" to **close a gap** in the **Leahy
Law** --- which **prohibits** the Defense Department and the State
Department from providing military **assistance** to foreign **security
forces** that **violate** **h**uman **r**ights]{.underline}.

Specifically, [the bill]{.underline} by Jacobs and Van Hollen [would
**require** human rights **vetting** for a pair of the **Pentagon's**
**security cooperation** programs]{.underline} --- "Section 127e" and
"Section 1202" --- that have drawn scrutiny in open-source reporting by
the Intercept and other media outlets.

"[**H**uman **r**ights **vetting** is an **essential part** of how we
**engage** with **other countries**]{.underline}, but [over the last two
decades Section 127e and Section 1202 have skirted these vetting
requirements and]{.underline}, in some cases, [been **used with
partners** who have **consistently violated** **h**uman
**r**ights]{.underline}," Jacobs said in a statement.
"**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [support for
**unvetted** human rights **abusers** is not only deeply immoral and
irresponsible, it is also **counterproductive**, leading to more unrest,
instability, and terrorist activity]{.underline}."

Van Hollen added in his own statement: "\[F\]or too long, [**legal
loopholes** have allowed the **D**epartment **o**f **D**efense to
**bypass** proper **vetting**, **reporting**, and **oversight
protocols** when providing **other nations** or **groups** with certain
types of **military assistance**]{.underline}."

Sen. PATRICK **[LEAHY]{.underline}** (D-Vt.), for whom the Leahy Law is
named, [said]{.underline} in a statement that the [Pentagon "should have
closed this loophole on its own initiative. The Upholding Human Rights
Abroad Act will **ensure** that the **Leahy Law** is **applied
uniformly**, so foreign partners are **vetted** and those who
**violate** **h**uman **r**ights are **excluded** from these
**programs**]{.underline}."

of the Leahy Law and the Role the Asylum System Should Play," Georgetown

A. Egypt

[[Despite]{.mark} its **[h]{.mark}**uman **[r]{.mark}**ights
[**record**, **Egypt** is]{.mark} one of the [**biggest recipients**
of]{.mark} **U.S. [aid]{.mark}**.]{.underline} A lower middle-income
country, Egypt received \$ 1.25 billion in U.S. foreign assistance in
FY2018. 40Of that amount, \$ 1 billion went towards foreign military
financing. 41Over the last 70 years, it has received over \$ 80 billion
in U.S. foreign assistance, 42and it has requested \$ 1.38 billion for
FY 2020. 43[While it remains a key foreign aid recipient, Egypt\'s
**h**uman **r**ights **record** is **disturbing**]{.underline}. 44

The [Egyptian state has **[tortured suspects]{.mark}**, implemented
**[mass trials]{.mark}** against **children**, and **[executed
detainees]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In January 2002, Mr. Ahmad El-Maati, a
falsely accused terrorist suspect, was tortured by Egyptian security
officials:

\[a\]n electric prod was used on \[El-Maati\'s\] hands, legs and
genitals during interrogations. His hands were cuffed so tightly that
his wrists bled. . . . He was kept blindfolded and handcuffed in a
hallway with other prisoners for what he estimates was about two weeks.
It was during this time, Mr. El-Maati says, that he developed anal
bleeding. Canadian doctors later diagnosed an anal fissure requiring
surgery. 45

Since 2013, the [Egyptian government\'s use of mass trials and death
sentences against children have skyrocketed;]{.underline} these include
death sentences [issued by military courts]{.underline} 46\-- the same
military [that has received **[billions of dollars]{.mark}** in
**assistance** from the U.S. government.]{.underline} 47The
[**U.S.-based** **h**uman **r**ights **organization**]{.underline},
Belady, [puts the number of [children arrested]{.mark} by the current
regime for political reasons at over 2,000]{.underline}. 48Since former
General el-Sisi assumed office, [Egypt has been among the ten countries
with the [**highest numbers** of **executions**]{.mark} per
year.]{.underline} 49At an Arab-EU summit in 2019, [el-[Sisi **stood
by**]{.mark} his government\'s [actions]{.mark}, arguing that executing
detainees is part of \"our humanity,\" distinguishing it from \"your
\[European\] humanity]{.underline}.\" 50Yet, Article 2 of the Egyptian
Constitution states that Islam is the official state religion and that
the primary source of legislation is Sharia law. 51The Quran forbids
unjust killing, including judicially mandated death sentences that lack
due process. 52El-Sisi\'s use of \"our humanity\" [as justification for
mass trials, death sentences in absentia, and sham military trials
should [**sound the alarms** for]{.mark} a [White House that]{.mark}
claims to be **[send]{.mark}ing [aid]{.mark}** to \"those who respect
us.\"]{.underline} 53

In April 2019, the [Egyptian Constitution was amended to lengthen
el-[Sisi\'s]{.mark} term from four to six years and to allow him to run
for an additional term, **[solidifying]{.mark}** his [**ability** to
**remain in power**]{.mark} until 2030; it also gave him far [**greater
control** over the **judicial branch**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 54The
[fairness of the referendum on these amendments was widely
**criticized**]{.underline}. Websites that encouraged people to vote
\"no\" were blocked by the government, and Egyptian citizens living
abroad were given very little notice to travel to a consulate to vote.
55

Between 2017 and 2019, [the Egyptian government blocked over 600 news,
political, and human rights websites without judicial
authorization]{.underline}. 56It was also [among the four worst
countries for journalists in 2018]{.underline}, with twenty-five
journalists arrested that year, nineteen of which detained for
\"spreading false news.\" 57In August 2020, [Egypt\'s \"special
counterterrorism courts\" sentenced in absentia Bahey eldin Hassan, a
prominent human rights activist, to fifteen years in prison for
criticizing President Sissi\'s]{.underline} regime on Twitter. 58

In May 2015, the [[State Department]{.mark} informed Congress that it
was in the national interest to **[continue assisting]{.mark}
[Egypt]{.mark}**, but it also highlighted many of the country\'s
violations that year]{.underline}, writing: \"Government forces have
committed [**arbitrary** or otherwise **unlawful killings** during
dispersal of demonstrators]{.underline}, of persons in custody, and
during military operations in the northern Sinai Peninsula.\" 59[This
was not an isolated incident.]{.underline} Public Law 115-141 states
that of the \$ 1.3 billion in assistance to Egypt, \$ 300 million must
be withheld until the Secretary of State certifies that Egypt is taking
effective steps on various human rights. 60However, it also states that
the Secretary may waive the certification requirement if he or she
determines that doing so is important to the national security interest
of the U.S. 61In August 2019, a year full of gross violations of human
rights by the Egyptian government, Secretary Pompeo invoked the national
security interest waiver. 62[Judging by the [**broad power** vested in
the Secretary of State]{.mark} by the statute, it is fairly
**[straightforward]{.mark}** for the Secretary [to **override**]{.mark}
the **[recommendations]{.mark}** of **DRL officials** and
**investigators** on the ground at U.S. embassies abroad]{.underline};
he or she merely has to declare that it is in the national security
interest of the U.S. to do so. 63

Despite Egypt\'s troubling track record (these are only a few examples),
the Trump administration has been outspoken in its support of the
Egyptian dictatorship. 64On April 3, 2017, President Trump welcomed
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to the White House. 65During an
interview in the Oval Office, President Trump spoke highly of his
Egyptian counterpart: \"We are very much behind President el-Sisi. He\'s
done a fantastic job . . . And I just want to say to you, Mr. President,
that you have a great friend and ally in the United States and in me.\"
66Just eighteen days later, on April 21, 2017, President Trump welcomed
to the White House Ms. Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American humanitarian
worker who was incarcerated by el-Sisi\'s regime for three years without
a trial. 67During the televised meeting, no mention was made of the
Egyptian government\'s treatment of Ms. Hijazi, and the President
refused to take any questions. 68Ironically, while in the Oval Office,
she sat in the same chair that was occupied by her authoritarian
persecutor eighteen days earlier. 69Furthermore, at the G7 Summit in
France in September 2019, President Trump notoriously called out,
\"Where\'s my favorite dictator?\" while awaiting a meeting with his
Egyptian counterpart. 70\"Egypt has a great leader, he\'s highly
respected, he\'s brought order,\" President Trump said at a meeting with
el-Sisi during the UN General Assembly in September 2019. 71That same
week, el-Sisi\'s regime arrested more than 2,000 peaceful protesters
throughout the country. 72

#### US-Egypt cooperation and funding of Suez canal [maritime chokepoint operations]{.underline} is key to [naval power projection]{.underline} AND [crises response]{.underline} -- AND, trade -- collapses [European]{.underline}, [Asian]{.underline}, AND [US economy]{.underline} -- empowers China to [imperil war reserves]{.underline} and cause [naval crises]{.underline}

About U.S. Maritime Security,\" National Interest,
<https://nationalinterest.org/feature/what-closing-suez-canal-says-about-us-maritime-security-182571>,
nihara

The Ever Given wasn't the first ship to block the Suez Canal. A
multi-ship pile-up in 2018 snarled maritime traffic there for two days.
But the sheer size and bulk of the Ever Given was a much greater
challenge---one that took 11 days to solve.

[As **container ships** grow ever more **massive**, it becomes
**increasingly difficult** to **clear accidents** quickly in **strategic
waterways**. This]{.underline} simple reality [has troubling
**economic** and **military implications**]{.underline}.

[[If]{.mark} a **[strategic]{.mark}** maritime [**chokepoint** such
as]{.mark} the **[Suez]{.mark} Canal** [is
**closed**]{.mark}]{.underline}, then [how long can this be **endured**
before the [U.S. **economy** suffers]{.mark} **serious
[damage]{.mark}**]{.underline}? And is the Navy appropriately positioned
and sized to contend with such closures?

When the Ever Given grounded on March 23, [**regional
[tensions]{.mark}** had been **[high]{.mark}** for months due to an
undeclared **tanker war** [between **Iran** and **Israel**]{.mark}.
There were also **mounting concerns** over **[Russian]{.mark} military
[forces]{.mark}** massing in **Crimea** and on **Ukraine's** Eastern
**borders**. To **move forces quickly** between the **Arabian Gulf** and
the **Mediterranean**, the U.S. [**Navy** must have **access** to the
**Suez Canal**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Without it, [naval forces must
circumnavigate Africa, taking **over a week** to arrive at a
**flashpoint**]{.underline}.

On the day before Ever Given's grounding, the [Eisenhower **carrier
strike group** (CSG) was in the Eastern Mediterranean conducting
**operations** against **ISIS**]{.underline} (Islamic State in Syria and
Iraq), [while the **Makin Island** amphibious ready group was in the
**Arabian Sea**. Had **tensions** turned to **conflict** in **Ukraine**
while the **canal was blocked**, the [nearest]{.mark} significant [naval
carrier]{.mark} strike force]{.underline} (the Theodore Roosevelt CSG)
[[would]{.mark} [have had to make]{.mark} a **[circuitous
transit]{.mark}** from the **Indian Ocean**]{.underline}---a danger
acknowledged publicly by the Pentagon.

The [Suez Canal **[closure]{.mark}** created a 360-ship traffic jam and
**[disrupted]{.mark}** almost **[13 percent]{.mark}** of **global
maritime [trade]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In addition to creating added
costs for shippers, [the **[blockage]{.mark}** is **anticipated** to
[cause]{.mark} downstream **[backlogs]{.mark}** as delayed ships surge
into and **overwhelm ports** and **losses** in **global trade** of up to
\$10 billion.]{.underline} The United States is less reliant on the Suez
Canal than [[European]{.mark} and [Asian economies]{.mark}]{.underline},
but [had the Panama Canal been similarly blocked[, it could **severely
impact** the U.S.]{.mark} economy]{.underline}, according to a 2010 U.S
government study.

The Ever Given episode proves that [ever-larger container ships
transiting strategic chokepoints pose a challenge for modern tugs and
salvage ships to quickly clear. It would take **weeks** for **global
supply chains** to adjust to a **prolonged disruption** of the Panama or
**Suez Canals**]{.underline}. Consider that, had this disruption
occurred during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, medical
supplies would have been delayed with high human costs.

[To **mitigate** such **disruptions**, the [Navy must ensure]{.mark} a
**distributed [forward naval presence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On April 2
the [Eisenhower CSG exited the Suez Canal heading south, leaving no
**naval strike group** supporting operations in the
Mediterranean]{.underline}.

Additionally, [the Navy---in [cooperation with]{.mark} the [State
Department]{.mark}---[should]{.mark} seek to [ensure]{.mark} that
**canal [operators]{.mark}** [have]{.mark} **adequate
[resources]{.mark}** to clear the largest of vessels, grounded or
intentionally sunk. [This would be in **Cairo's**]{.mark} **financial
[interest]{.mark}** as well as ours]{.underline}. The [Suez Canal
generates annual revenues of \$5.6 billion, [providing Egypt
with]{.mark} critical **[foreign currency]{.mark}** and [making
up]{.mark} almost **two percent** of its **economy**.]{.underline}
Similarly, [the Panama Canal generates \$3.4 billion in annual revenues
and accounts for **40 percent** of that nation's
[economy]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Nonetheless, [the [nation needs to]{.mark} look to procuring the
capacity to **unilaterally [re-open]{.mark}** strategic [**chokepoints**
should]{.mark} the [need **arise**]{.mark} in a
**conflict**]{.underline}. In the case of Ever Given, it required a
special suction dredger able to remove two thousand cubic meters of soil
an hour and special heavy capacity salvage tugs, like the Dutch ALP
Guard which took five days to arrive.

Additionally, a third party with controlling stock of chokepoints,
notably [**[China]{.mark}** in the **Panama Canal**, [can **imperil
transit** of]{.mark} **critical [war reserves]{.mark}** [or]{.mark}
**naval [vessels]{.mark}** [in **crisis**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On this
more action is needed.

With the Biden administration seeking a multi-trillion dollar
"infrastructure" bill, it would be wise to consider investments that
harden the U.S. economy to such disruptions. After all, in 2011, [the
U.S. relied on maritime shipping to receive 53 percent of its imports
and send 38 percent of its exports]{.underline} and remains much the
same today.

Ever Given's grounding comes at a time when more and more political
leaders and naval thinkers are turning to the precepts of America's
revered maritime visionary---Alfred Thayer Mahan---to answer the core
question: "What is a Navy for?" The sight of hundreds of ships backed up
around the Suez Canal as tensions rose from the Taiwan Straits to the
Black Sea should be instructive.

#### Trade solves global crises

Ian **Bremmer 19**, PhD, Professor, Applied Geopolitics, Columbia
University\'s School of International and Public Affairs, President,
Eurasia Group, , editor-at-large at Time, 11/18/19, \"The End of the
American International Order: What Comes Next?\", Time,
https://time.com/5730849/end-american-order-what-next/

China has made its decision. Beijing is building [[a **separate system**
of **Chinese tech**]{.mark}nology---its own standards, infrastructure,
and supply chains]{.underline}---to compete with the West. Make no
mistake: this [is the single most consequential geopolitical decision
taken in the last three decades. It's also [the **greatest threat** to
**globalization** since]{.mark} the end of **[World War
II.]{.mark}**]{.underline} It wasn't supposed to be like this.
[Globalization has [lifted **billions**]{.mark} of people [from
**poverty**]{.mark} around the world. We now live longer, healthier, and
more productive lives than ever before]{.underline}. We are better
educated and better informed than at any time in history. [There has
never been a better place and a better time to be alive]{.underline}
than right here, right now. [So why are so many people so angry, and why
is globalization under unprecedented threat?]{.underline} Why are
citizens in country after country bitterly casting aside both governing
and opposition parties in favor of political disruptors? At this moment
in history, why is there so much alarm? [Because this IS a moment of
transformation, and uncertainty. In much of the world, the
**[lightning-fast, cross-border flows]{.mark}** of ideas, information,
people, money, goods and services---the same forces that have created so
much opportunity and prosperity---also [generate **fear**.]{.mark} Fear
that [the world]{.mark} now [becomes **more complicated** and]{.mark}
more **[dangerous]{.mark}** in real time]{.underline}. Fear that the
world we knew is gone for good, and fear that no one is willing and able
to do anything about it. I want to talk with you today about why all
this is happening, and why it's so vitally important that we're having
this conversation at this moment---and in the heart of this great
country. Japan is both blessed and burdened by its unique place in this
G-Zero world. Japan has the political stability, the foresight, and the
technological talent to help lead the world into a brighter future than
the one we currently face. We all have reason to hope that Japan's
leaders, its companies, its political will, and its people will help
lead the transition toward a new order, one in which human ingenuity,
moral imagination, and courage can help all of us meet the challenges to
come. The Geopolitical Recession When I started Eurasia Group in 1998,
our clients were interested almost exclusively in the so-called
emerging-markets countries, those that presented both big growth
opportunities and unfamiliar political challenges. I defined an emerging
market as "any country where politics matters at least as much as
economic fundamentals for market outcomes." Countries like Japan, the
United States, Canada, and the leading nations of Western Europe offered
a much more stable and predictable political landscape, but more modest
opportunities for growth. Those days are gone. The financial crisis of
2008 and the turmoil that followed have brought politics directly into
the performance of economies and markets in even the world's richest
countries. [We]{.underline} also [face a growing number of
**[transnational threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The U.S.-led global
order is finished. So many of the [dark clouds]{.underline} now hanging
over us---from **[[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
[**[cyber]{.mark}**-conflict]{.underline}, from
[**[terror]{.mark}**ism]{.underline} to [the post-industrial
revolution---move unchecked across borders, leaving national governments
much less able to meet the needs of their citizens.]{.underline} Today,
[it is not economics but geopolitics that has become the main driver of
global economic uncertainty. The world has entered [a **"geopolitical
recession,"**]{.mark} a [**bust**]{.mark} cycle for [the **international
system**]{.mark} and **[relations]{.mark}** among
governments]{.underline}. It's a time when [**[alliances]{.mark}**,
institutions, and the values that bind them]{.underline} together are
all [coming apart.]{.underline} From an historical perspective,
geopolitical recessions are both rarer than economic recessions and
longer-lasting. We'll be living in this geopolitical recession for at
least a decade to come. How did we get here? Economists tell us that the
process of "creative destruction" fuels the engine of growth that builds
the future, and history says that's true. But lives and livelihoods are
destroyed in the process, and growing numbers of people say their
government is either powerless to help them manage or doesn't care what
happens to them. Resentment of elites is on the rise in every region of
the world. [The system is rigged]{.underline} against them, they
believe; it's increasingly hard to argue they're wrong. This [[creates
opportunities for]{.mark} a new breed of **[populist]{.mark}** who
offers [scapegoats]{.mark} and promises of protection]{.underline}.
These politicians did not invent this problem. They're just profiting
from it. And the greatest worry is this: [**All [this]{.mark} anger
[is]{.mark} building [in good economic times]{.mark}. What happens [when
economies start to slow]{.mark}?**]{.underline} History shows that
[[governments]{.mark} that are **[unpopular at home]{.mark}** are more
likely to **[make trouble abroad]{.mark}**, especially with their
neighbors, [to]{.mark} rally public support and **[divert
attention]{.mark}** from domestic troubles. That breeds less trust among
governments. The risk of misunderstanding rises. [**Accidents** are
**more likely**]{.mark}---and more likely [to **escalate**]{.mark}
toward conflict.]{.underline} There are three implications to
consider... The first centers on "tail risks," the
low-likelihood-but-high-impact events that have become commonplace in a
world reshaped by China's rise, Middle East turmoil, populist Europe,
revanchist Russia, divided America, a world-record 71 million displaced
people, and the destabilizing effects of technological and climate
changes. [Imagine a military accident in [the **S**]{.mark}outh
**[C]{.mark}**hina **[S]{.mark}**ea]{.underline}, at a time [when the
U.S. and Chinese presidents are locked in a war of wills over trade and
technology]{.underline}, and determined to project strength at home,
[that spirals out of control. Turn to the **[Middle
East]{.mark}**]{.underline}---the U.S. has confronted
[Iran]{.underline}. Since President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the
Iran nuclear deal and then re-imposed sanctions, Iran has taken bold
military action---including a strike on the heart of [Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}'s oil infrastructure. Washington responded by
sending troops to Saudi Arabia, a move which, you might recall, sharply
increased the risk of terrorism in the U.S. a generation ago. What if
President Trump is defeated for re-election next year, and **[[North
Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s Kim Jong-un discovers the next U.S.
president won't accept his phone calls? What provocative action might he
take? What accidents might he risk? What if a debt crisis hits Italy,
created when a future Italian government defies
**[[EU]{.underline}]{.mark}** budget rules and inadvertently creates a
[financial crisis]{.underline} too large for lenders to manage? Or a
miscalculation in [Ukraine]{.underline} pulls
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** into a [shooting war]{.underline}? Or
a [US-Russia cyber confrontation]{.underline} hits critical
infrastructure, creating a humanitarian crisis inside an American city?
[The lack of coordinated leadership in today's world, our
**[G-zero]{.mark}** world, [makes]{.mark} all of these [crises]{.mark}
both more likely to happen and [**more difficult** to manage]{.mark}
when they do]{.underline}. Individually, they are long-shots.
Collectively, [they pose unprecedented danger]{.underline}. The second
implication of the geopolitical recession is the breakdown of
international institutions. The [tens of [millions of
**displaced**]{.mark} people]{.underline} around the world today
[[create]{.mark} one of the most **[urgent]{.mark}** and expensive
**[problems]{.mark}**]{.underline} that the United Nations has to cope
with. Yet, even as national governments are less willing to welcome big
numbers of refugees, even fewer are willing to invest more to support
the UN Refugee Agency. We also see fragmentation of European
institutions as voters send growing numbers of anti-EU politicians to
serve in the European parliament. There is no longer consensus among
Europeans on the free movement of EU citizens across borders, on how to
manage immigrants from outside the EU, or on important questions like
how best to manage relations with Russia. The Trump administration has
threatened the coherence of NATO, the most successful military alliance
in history (French President Macron certainly seems to agree), and has
withdrawn the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty with Russia, the UN Human
Rights Council, and the Paris Climate Accord, to name only a few. [The
inevitable consequence of all this is a world that has become more
unpredictable and much less safe. There is little chance in this
environment to establish new agreements and new institutions to help
manage tomorrow's crises.]{.underline} Instead, [individual [governments
will adopt their **own rules**]{.mark} in an attempt to contain
challenges that don't respect borders. They will [threaten **economic
penalties**]{.mark} and **[military retaliation]{.mark}** in a world
[with fewer]{.mark} institutions able to enforce **[generally accepted
rules and practices]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The last implication of the
geopolitical recession: The weakness of today's international system
[not only]{.underline} leaves the world [more vulnerable to crisis, but
less resilient when crisis comes. In recent years, [we've avoided a
major international crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}. We've seen Brexit, the
election of Donald Trump, the growth of populism across Europe, Russia's
bid to undermine Ukraine's independence, Xi Jinping's consolidation of
power in China, a meltdown in Venezuela, and plenty of individual fires
in the Middle East and in democracies across the world.
[**[But]{.mark}** we have not yet experienced anything during this
period that poses a challenge to the entire international system, and
[the]{.mark} global [**economy** has remained]{.mark} relatively
[**strong**.]{.mark} Our luck can't last.]{.underline}

#### Naval power solves nuclear war

**Cropsey and McGrath, 18**---Director AND Deputy Director, Center for
American Seapower (Seth and Bryan, "Maritime Strategy in a New Era of
Great Power Competition,"
<https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.hudson.org/files/publications/HudsonMaritimeStrategy.pdf>,
dml)

As a maritime nation, [[naval power is the U.S.'s **most useful means**
of **responding to**]{.mark} **distant [crises]{.mark}**[, preventing
them]{.mark} from **harming our security** or that of our allies and
partners, and keeping geographically remote threats from
[**metastasizing into conflicts** that could **approach our
borders**]{.mark}]{.underline}. A maritime defense demands a maritime
strategy. As national resources are increasingly strained the need
exists for a strategy that makes deliberate choices to connect ends
(security) with means (money and the fleet it builds). This paper
examines the need for a maritime strategy, discusses options, and offers
recommendations for policy makers.

[After several decades of unchallenged world leadership, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates once again [faces **great power
competition**]{.mark}]{.underline}, this time featuring two other world
powers. China and Russia increasingly bristle under the constraints of
the post-World War II systems of global trade, finance, and governance
largely created by the United States and its allies, systems that the
United States has protected and sustained to the economic and security
benefit of its citizens and the citizens of other nations. [Both
[**China** and **Russia**]{.mark} are **demonstrably improving the
quality** of their armed forces while **simultaneously acting
aggressively** toward neighboring countries]{.underline}, some of which
are US treaty allies. Additionally, [both nations [are **turning their
attention to naval operations**]{.mark} far from their own
coasts]{.underline}, operations designed to advance national interests
that are often in tension with those of the United States.1

For the past several decades, US national security strategy has not had
to contend with great powers. Instead, it has concerned itself primarily
with building alliances designed to manage regional security more
efficiently by proxy, while devoting increasingly more resources to
homeland defense and intelligence aimed at stemming acts of terror by
Islamic radical organizations and their followers. To the extent that
the US position of leadership in the world was not threatened, this
strategy was reasonable, if imperfectly pursued. Such a strategy will no
longer suffice in a world of great power competition, especially one in
which powers of considerable---but unequal---strength are opposed.
Unbalanced multi-polarity is an especially unstable condition, and the
United States is not effectively postured to manage that instability.
Henry Kissinger divides the concept of world order into two parts: a
normative system that defines acceptable action, and a 'balance of
power' arrangement that punishes the breach of such conventions2. As the
underlying balance of forces shifts, states with different ideas of
international order gain the power to reshape the system. Thucydides'
ancient insight holds true -- the rise in power of one actor threatens
all others. Where such threat exists and if the balance of power between
states or coalitions approaches equilibrium, a "Cold War" between
competing ideological camps occurs. In an unbalanced system, the
stronger side is tempted to strike its weaker opponent while the balance
of forces is favorable. Unbridled competition for supremacy defined
Europe during its bloodiest periods. Europe's 16th and 17th century
religious wars between Catholics and Protestants and the global 20th
century struggles between totalitarian ideologies and democracy both
represent the natural end-state of unbalanced multipolar systems.
Without norms to restrain states and force to uphold these norms,
violence is very likely.

[Today's international system is moving toward **unbalanced
multi-polarity**]{.underline}. Unfortunately, [the United States is
**not currently prepared** to manage such an international environment.
If Americans want to preserve their nation's secure and prosperous
position as the world's great power, the United States **must begin now
to prepare strategically** for what it will inevitably
face]{.underline}. Otherwise, it will ultimately be forced into an
increasingly limited number of unattractive options to sustain its
position of leadership.

[There is **little evidence** that the people of the United States wish
to **see our position in the world diminished**]{.underline}. The 2016
Presidential Election raised important questions about the degree to
which globalization has served the interests of everyday Americans (and
their perceptions thereof), while the two dominant US political parties
have moved toward more protectionist policies, at least as articulated
by their nominees. Opinion polling indicates the divided nature of the
American public on issues like free trade and sustained foreign
commitments.3 However, [Americans **remain cognizant of threats** to the
United States, and **favor maintaining America's position** as a great
power by sustaining a strong military]{.underline}.4 Moreover, it would
be difficult to identify meaningful numbers of Americans who would
sacrifice national security in favor of increased social spending,
despite the continuing rise in non-discretionary spending in the federal
budget. [Americans understand that the US position of world leadership
benefits]{.underline} the nation's economy, its security, its allies,
and [the international order]{.underline} that has been the object of US
foreign and defense policy for over a century. They know that their
lives would be diminished if this position of global leadership were
surrendered to an adversary or group of them. The paradox of the
American experience is that the US is not simply a great power -- it is
an exceptional power, for which ideals count as much as strength.
[[The]{.mark} American [public, **despite its aversion** to foreign
commitments, **can rise to the occasion** and **respond to**]{.mark}
**clear [threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as it has in both World Wars,
the Cold War, and after September 11th. [The **job of the
policymaker**]{.underline}, therefore, [is to **ensure America remains a
great power**]{.underline}, so that when the occasion arises, it can act
as an exceptional power.

It is critical then, for US political leaders to begin thinking more
strategically about protecting and advancing America\'s position in the
face of growing great power competition. This monograph asserts that a
strategy to support such a goal would necessarily be maritime in nature,
leveraging this nation's great geographical advantages in the service of
its national power. Sharing land borders with only two nations---both of
whom are friendly to the United States---and separated from other great
powers by vast oceans, the United States enjoys a security position
quite unlike that of any other nation. For over a century, it has been
the unspoken (but doggedly pursued) national security aim of the United
States to ensure that no power rise to prominence in Asia or Europe so
as to occupy a position there as dominant as the United States' position
in the Western Hemisphere. Were this to occur, not only could that
nation then lock the United States out of the resources and activity of
that region, but it could also then eventually turn its attention to
challenging our position in the Western Hemisphere.5

Underlying this approach is the reality that [[most the world's activity
**does not occur in our**]{.mark} **own [hemisphere]{.mark}**[, but in
**Asia** and **Europe**]{.mark}. [American interests]{.mark} in these
regions]{.underline}--- political, diplomatic, economic, and
military---[[are **considerable** and **growing**. **Protecting** and
**sustaining** those]{.mark} interests **[must remain a
priority]{.mark}**]{.underline} of American policy, [[and **maritime
strategy** is an **effective tool**]{.underline}]{.mark} in doing so.

Maritime strategy is a subset of grand strategy, and the relationship
between the two is ably defined by Professor John B. Hattendorf of the
Naval War College: "In its broadest sense, grand strategy is the
comprehensive direction of power to achieve particular national goals.
Within those terms, maritime strategy is the direction of all aspects of
national power that relate to a nation's interests at sea. The navy
serves this purpose, but maritime strategy is not purely a naval
preserve. Maritime strategy involves the other functions of state power
that include diplomacy; the safety and defence of merchant trade at sea;
fishing; the exploitation, conservation, regulation and defence of the
exclusive economic zone at sea; coastal defence; security of national
borders; the protection of offshore islands; as well as participation in
regional and world-wide concerns relating to the use of oceans, the
skies over the oceans and the land under the seas.6 [It is wholly
appropriate for the world's]{.underline} dominant naval
power---separated from its widely-flung interests by thousands of miles
of open ocean---to develop and execute coherent maritime strategy. In a
time of re-emerging great power competition, it is essential. The
nation's current maritime strategy7 is, unfortunately, not up to the
task. It focuses insufficiently on great power competition; it does not
recognize the rise in importance of conventional forces in deterring
great power war; it does not provide a theory of conventional deterrence
appropriate to great powers and their likely objectives; it does not
suggest a posture for naval forces that acts as an effective deterrent;
its derived force structure is too small and short on effective logistic
support; it does not place sufficient value on naval partnerships with
geographically important nations which may not be traditional partners;
and it is silent on the need for the nation to invest in a maritime
industrial base that can enable an appropriate strategy. This monograph
urges new thinking about maritime strategy, a strategy compatible with
the United States' responsibilities as the leader of the free world, as
well as the world's premier political, military, economic, and
diplomatic power. Such a strategy would seek to protect and sustain
those leadership positions in the face of renewed great power
competition, competition that largely subsumes other, lesser security
concerns. There will be those who view this approach as a return to
"Cold War" strategic thinking, and we do not shy from this comparison.
The United States acted for decades as a coherent strategic actor when
faced with expansionist Soviet totalitarianism, and it must act with
equal coherence and resolve to contest China and Russia's brands of
aggressive mercantilism, regional expansion, and contempt for
established global order. There will be those who evaluate our
suggestions in this paper and conclude that the nation cannot afford it,
that the expense associated with moving to a maritime grand strategy
would imbalance the traditional "ends, ways, means" approach to the
making of strategy. And while the ends, ways, means approach is
generally relevant to military and operational strategy, it is unsuited
to the making of grand strategy for one very important reason. Unlike
subordinate levels of strategy, grand strategy re-allocates, realigns,
and re-orients a nation's "means" to serve strategic "ends". Military
strategy starts with the proposition that there is a certain resource
level available to pursue its ends. Grand strategy starts with the sum
of the nation's output capacity, and then determines how it can most
effectively be allocated to the achievement of strategic goals.

Short of war itself, there is nothing in American history that causes
strategic realignment more reliably than a change in Administration, and
we wish to be part of that dialogue. [We argue]{.underline} here [for a
**new theory of deterrence**]{.underline}, one that revises the Cold War
approach in which the Soviet Union was deterred from large-scale
conventional attack by the threat of nuclear escalation. Under that
rubric, one could justifiably say that America's conventional deterrent
was dependent on its strategic deterrent. [Today, the decapitating
"**bolt from the blue**" strike is **even more remote** than it was in
the Cold War, and to the extent that **[nuclear exchange between great
powers]{.mark}** is conceivable, it [is **far more likely** to flow from
**conventional conflict that has gone awry**]{.mark}. Therefore, [to
**deter nuclear war**, we **must deter conventional war**. **No aspect**
of]{.mark} American [military power will be **more critical to deterring
either nuclear** or **conventional super-power war** than
**seapower**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Egyptian businessmen ordered more than 30,000 rocket-propelled grenades
from US rival North Korea in a secret deal last year, the Washington
Post reported on Sunday. The United Nations described it as the "largest
seizure of ammunition in the history of sanctions against the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea".

The UN revealed that the business executives sought to buy weapons for
the Egyptian military. The report prompted US criticism, while the
Egyptian embassy in Washington pointed to Egypt's willingness to
cooperate with UN officials in "finding and destroying the contraband".

The Post reported that the North Korea incident was among a number of
factors that led US President Donald Trump's administration to freeze
nearly \$300m in military aid to Egypt in August.

[[Egypt]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[remains **unaccountable** for
**h**]{.mark}uman **[r]{.mark}**ights
**[violations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Over the past several years, [there have been many concerns
over]{.underline} human rights abuses, including [**suppressing**
**freedom of speech** and the **implementation** of **laws** that
**limit** the operations of **civil society groups**.]{.underline}

Does Egypt's human rights record really matter?

The [[US has not taken]{.mark} any **substantial [punitive
measures]{.mark}** against Egypt, even as organisations]{.underline}
such as Human Rights Watch [describe Egypt's current human rights crisis
as **the worst** "in the country's modern history".]{.underline}

[[Egypt will]{.mark} likely **[continue to receive assistance]{.mark}
regardless of legal provisions it might be violating**]{.underline},
said James Gelvin, a professor of Middle East history at the University
of California, noting that [human rights-based **[restrictions]{.mark}**
[are]{.mark} almost "**[routinely ignored]{.mark}** when committed by a
government the **US wishes to support**".]{.underline}

Along with Israel and Afghanistan, [Egypt is one of the **three biggest
recipients** of US funding and weapons]{.underline}.

How much aid does the US provide to Egypt?

Since 1979, [Egypt has been [receiving **uninterrupted aid**]{.mark} at
an average of **\$1.6bn** a year, the bulk of which goes to the
**military**]{.underline}.

[Military support has come in the form of **arms distribution** and
**military training** services]{.underline}. A biennial series of joint
military exercises led by Egyptian and US troops in Egypt commenced in
1980.

Referred to as Operation Bright Star, the [coalition training is
designed to strengthen ties between the two country's forces and to
assist the United States in solidifying its strategic alliances in the
Middle East]{.underline}.

In August, the US cut tens of millions in aid from Egypt, citing the
country's failure to make progress on human rights and democratic norms
-- but [experts described these [cuts]{.mark} as **[largely
symbolic]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Why does Egypt get US aid?

For a country to become an eligible recipient of US aid, it must align
itself with American interests and foreign policy, analysts say.

[In the case of Egypt, US aid]{.underline} granted since the signing of
the 1978 Camp David Accords [was "**[untouchable]{.mark}
[compensation]{.mark}**[" for maintaining **peace with Israel**]{.mark}.
This deal is considered a **cornerstone** of **US-Egyptian
relations**.]{.underline}

Robert Springborg, a Middle East expert and non-resident fellow at the
Italian Institute of International Affairs, told Al Jazeera that US
economic support was intended to stabilise Anwar Sadat's \[former
Egyptian president\] government and succeeding ones.

How does the US benefit?

The [primary [benefit is]{.mark} the "[**cessation of hostilities
against Israel**" by **Egypt**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and "other Arab
states that could not wage war against Israel in the **absence** of
**Egyptian participation**"]{.underline}, Springborg said.

In addition to Egyptian support for American "counterterrorism and
counterinsurgency" campaigns, Springborg says the US also enjoys
marginal benefits, including access to Egyptian airspace and the
prioritisation of US naval vessels through the Suez Canal.

The high amount of military aid, in particular, has also helped to
create jobs and to reduce unemployment in the US. More than 1.3 million
Americans work in manufacturing weaponry for defence companies, and more
than three million others support the industry indirectly.

The US is among the world's top five arms producers and distributors,
according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

"The United States does not give money to Egypt for military equipment;
it gives the Egyptian military a list of equipment the American
government will purchase on its behalf in the United States," Gelvin
told Al Jazeera.

What about economic aid?

Economic assistance, or American "investments" in Egypt, are a
relatively small part of the package, analysts say.

Economic aid now stands at less than \$200m annually, compared with more
than \$1bn from the early 1980s through the early 2000s, Springborg
said.

Egypt's domestic stability is important to the US, and so there is a
sustained interest in its local economy. If the Egyptian economy
collapses, it will render the region unstable, Gelvin said. And since
the Egyptian military controls up to 60 percent of the Egyptian economy,
it is unlikely that it will relinquish economic control to other
institutions or factions in Egypt.

According to Gelvin, this was part of the Camp David package: "Since the
army was not going to fight its main enemy of 30 years, it had to have
some reason for being, and being so large."

Aid stream for Egypt continuing despite violations

There are both political and legal conditions that must be met by
countries on the US foreign aid list.

In 2012, US Congress made aid to Egypt conditional on the secretary of
state certifying that the country was supporting human rights and
democratic values. This came in response to an Egyptian crackdown on
American NGO workers.

The amendment also required the secretary of state to ensure that Egypt
was upholding its commitments to the Egypt-Israel peace treaty.

Yet these [[provisions **have not affected** the **aid stream** to
**Egypt**]{.mark}, a country **infamous** for its **human rights
abuses**.]{.underline}

In 2012, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton waived the
certification requirements after the Obama administration claimed that
there was no way of ensuring such provisions were met.

In 2013, a military takeover that led to the removal of Egypt's first
democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, struck "concern" among
top White House officials, but they fell short of calling it a coup,
which would have prohibited them from providing Egypt with military
equipment.

A. Egypt

[[Despite]{.mark} its **[h]{.mark}**uman **[r]{.mark}**ights
[**record**, **Egypt** is]{.mark} one of the [**biggest recipients**
of]{.mark} **U.S. [aid]{.mark}**.]{.underline} A lower middle-income
country, Egypt received \$ 1.25 billion in U.S. foreign assistance in
FY2018. 40Of that amount, \$ 1 billion went towards foreign military
financing. 41Over the last 70 years, it has received over \$ 80 billion
in U.S. foreign assistance, 42and it has requested \$ 1.38 billion for
FY 2020. 43[While it remains a key foreign aid recipient, Egypt\'s
**h**uman **r**ights **record** is **disturbing**]{.underline}. 44

The [Egyptian state has **[tortured suspects]{.mark}**, implemented
**[mass trials]{.mark}** against **children**, and **[executed
detainees]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In January 2002, Mr. Ahmad El-Maati, a
falsely accused terrorist suspect, was tortured by Egyptian security
officials:

\[a\]n electric prod was used on \[El-Maati\'s\] hands, legs and
genitals during interrogations. His hands were cuffed so tightly that
his wrists bled. . . . He was kept blindfolded and handcuffed in a
hallway with other prisoners for what he estimates was about two weeks.
It was during this time, Mr. El-Maati says, that he developed anal
bleeding. Canadian doctors later diagnosed an anal fissure requiring
surgery. 45

Since 2013, the [Egyptian government\'s use of mass trials and death
sentences against children have skyrocketed;]{.underline} these include
death sentences [issued by military courts]{.underline} 46\-- the same
military [that has received **[billions of dollars]{.mark}** in
**assistance** from the U.S. government.]{.underline} 47The
[**U.S.-based** **h**uman **r**ights **organization**]{.underline},
Belady, [puts the number of [children arrested]{.mark} by the current
regime for political reasons at over 2,000]{.underline}. 48Since former
General el-Sisi assumed office, [Egypt has been among the ten countries
with the [**highest numbers** of **executions**]{.mark} per
year.]{.underline} 49At an Arab-EU summit in 2019, [el-[Sisi **stood
by**]{.mark} his government\'s [actions]{.mark}, arguing that executing
detainees is part of \"our humanity,\" distinguishing it from \"your
\[European\] humanity]{.underline}.\" 50Yet, Article 2 of the Egyptian
Constitution states that Islam is the official state religion and that
the primary source of legislation is Sharia law. 51The Quran forbids
unjust killing, including judicially mandated death sentences that lack
due process. 52El-Sisi\'s use of \"our humanity\" [as justification for
mass trials, death sentences in absentia, and sham military trials
should [**sound the alarms** for]{.mark} a [White House that]{.mark}
claims to be **[send]{.mark}ing [aid]{.mark}** to \"those who respect
us.\"]{.underline} 53

In April 2019, the [Egyptian Constitution was amended to lengthen
el-[Sisi\'s]{.mark} term from four to six years and to allow him to run
for an additional term, **[solidifying]{.mark}** his [**ability** to
**remain in power**]{.mark} until 2030; it also gave him far [**greater
control** over the **judicial branch**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 54The
[fairness of the referendum on these amendments was widely
**criticized**]{.underline}. Websites that encouraged people to vote
\"no\" were blocked by the government, and Egyptian citizens living
abroad were given very little notice to travel to a consulate to vote.
55

Between 2017 and 2019, [the Egyptian government blocked over 600 news,
political, and human rights websites without judicial
authorization]{.underline}. 56It was also [among the four worst
countries for journalists in 2018]{.underline}, with twenty-five
journalists arrested that year, nineteen of which detained for
\"spreading false news.\" 57In August 2020, [Egypt\'s \"special
counterterrorism courts\" sentenced in absentia Bahey eldin Hassan, a
prominent human rights activist, to fifteen years in prison for
criticizing President Sissi\'s]{.underline} regime on Twitter. 58

In May 2015, the [[State Department]{.mark} informed Congress that it
was in the national interest to **[continue assisting]{.mark}
[Egypt]{.mark}**, but it also highlighted many of the country\'s
violations that year]{.underline}, writing: \"Government forces have
committed [**arbitrary** or otherwise **unlawful killings** during
dispersal of demonstrators]{.underline}, of persons in custody, and
during military operations in the northern Sinai Peninsula.\" 59[This
was not an isolated incident.]{.underline} Public Law 115-141 states
that of the \$ 1.3 billion in assistance to Egypt, \$ 300 million must
be withheld until the Secretary of State certifies that Egypt is taking
effective steps on various human rights. 60However, it also states that
the Secretary may waive the certification requirement if he or she
determines that doing so is important to the national security interest
of the U.S. 61In August 2019, a year full of gross violations of human
rights by the Egyptian government, Secretary Pompeo invoked the national
security interest waiver. 62[Judging by the [**broad power** vested in

Despite Egypt\'s troubling track record (these are only a few examples),
the Trump administration has been outspoken in its support of the
Egyptian dictatorship. 64On April 3, 2017, President Trump welcomed
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to the White House. 65During an
interview in the Oval Office, President Trump spoke highly of his
Egyptian counterpart: \"We are very much behind President el-Sisi. He\'s
done a fantastic job . . . And I just want to say to you, Mr. President,
that you have a great friend and ally in the United States and in me.\"
66Just eighteen days later, on April 21, 2017, President Trump welcomed
to the White House Ms. Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American humanitarian
worker who was incarcerated by el-Sisi\'s regime for three years without
a trial. 67During the televised meeting, no mention was made of the
Egyptian government\'s treatment of Ms. Hijazi, and the President
refused to take any questions. 68Ironically, while in the Oval Office,
she sat in the same chair that was occupied by her authoritarian
persecutor eighteen days earlier. 69Furthermore, at the G7 Summit in
France in September 2019, President Trump notoriously called out,
\"Where\'s my favorite dictator?\" while awaiting a meeting with his
Egyptian counterpart. 70\"Egypt has a great leader, he\'s highly
respected, he\'s brought order,\" President Trump said at a meeting with
el-Sisi during the UN General Assembly in September 2019. 71That same
week, el-Sisi\'s regime arrested more than 2,000 peaceful protesters
throughout the country. 72

Conventional Defeat

The [idea that Israel might lose a conventional war seems ridiculous
now]{.underline}, but [the **origins** of the [**Israeli nuclear
program** lay in the **fear** that]{.mark} the **[Arab states]{.mark}**
would [develop]{.mark} a **decisive [military advantage]{.mark}** that
they could use to **inflict** battlefield **defeats**.]{.underline} This
came close to happening during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, as the [Egyptian
Army seized the Suez Canal]{.underline} and the Syrian Arab Army
advanced into the Golan Heights. [Accounts on how seriously Israel
debated using nukes during that war remain murky]{.underline}, but there
is no question that [[Israel could consider using]{.mark} its most
[**powerful weapons** if]{.mark} the **[conventional balance]{.mark}
tipped** decisively out of its favor.]{.underline}

How might that happen? We can imagine a few [scenarios]{.underline},
most of which [[involve]{.mark} an [**increase** in **hostility**
between **Israel**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} its more tolerant
neighbors.]{.underline} Another revolution in [**[Egypt]{.mark}** could
easily **rewrite** the **security equation** on Israel's southern
border]{.underline}; while the friendship of Saudi Arabia seems secure,
political instability could change that; even Turkish policy might shift
in a negative direction. [Israel currently has overwhelming
[conventional]{.mark} **military [advantages]{.mark}**, but these
advantages **[depend]{.mark}** to some extent [on]{.mark} a
**[favorable]{.mark}** regional **strategic [environment]{.mark}**.
**[Political shifts]{.mark}** could [leave **Israel**]{.mark}
diplomatically [**isolated**, and **vulnerable**]{.mark} once again to
conventional attack.]{.underline} In such a situation, [nuclear
weapons]{.underline} would remain part of the toolkit for

The [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [recently
[authorized]{.mark} **\$2.5 billion** in **[arms sales]{.mark}** to
**Egypt**]{.underline}. The [weapons were **military planes** and air
defense **radar systems**.]{.underline} This follows a \$170 million
military aid authorization in September. [It also **[precedes]{.mark}**
the **[suspension]{.mark}** of \$130 million of **military
aid**]{.underline}. This suspension occurred [because Cairo **did not
meet standards** [about]{.mark} **basic** **[h]{.mark}**uman
**[r]{.mark}**ights **[conditions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Egypt]{.mark} has been the [**second highest recipient** of]{.mark}
**U.S. military [aid]{.mark}** worldwide]{.underline}. They receive
\$1.3 billion per year, most of which is foreign military financing.
This aid is [earmarked to buy U.S. weapons, equipment, and
training.]{.underline} The [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} administration
[[notes]{.mark} that this **aid** is going to a [**country**]{.mark}
that **[violates]{.mark}** U.S. **[Leahy]{.mark} Law** practices. These
are the rules that intend to **prevent** **h**uman **r**ights **abuses**
from **U.S. security aid**.]{.underline} This acknowledgement happened
both in 2020 and when it canceled the most recent suspended aid
delivery.

Thus, the \$2.5 billion sale is an example of a risky sale that the
administration should avoid. According to the recently released 2021
Arms Sales Risk Index, Egypt ranks as the eighteenth most risky
recipient of arms sales. The government is corrupt, undemocratic,
commits human rights abuses, and inspires terrorism. Sending Egypt
billions of dollars of U.S. weapons may seem like aiding an ally.
Instead, this means that the U.S. needs to choose better allies.

Before, U.S. weapons have financed the Egyptian military. Between 2009
and 2020, the U.S. has sent Egypt \$3.2 billion in fighter aircrafts,
\$2.3 billion in rotary aircrafts, \$1.58 billion in support, \$1.3
billion in tanks and armored vehicles, \$240 million in naval craft, and
over \$1.4 billion in missiles, munitions, and radar.

The history and current administration's policy on arms sales to Egypt
make little sense. These weapons are not going to causes like improving
human rights. From a data perspective, its score in the human rights
components of the Cato Institute's Arms Sales Risk Index have worsened
every year.

Beyond the data, over the last five years, Egypt has waged a proxy
conflict against Turkey in Libya, is home to around 1,000 ISIS
militants, has forced human rights groups to shut down, uses advanced
technology to track and target citizens, institutes a prison system that
has led to increasing recruits for ISIS and al-​Qaeda, and used a
draconian counterterrorism campaign to murder 755 people -- many of whom
are simple political opposition, not terrorists. The military-​led
government and military itself commit these crimes.

Overall, U.S. weapons in Egypt fund a government whose draconian
policies lead to arguments with other Middle Eastern countries and
inspire and enable terrorist groups. These weapons help the Egyptian
government commit some of the worst human rights abuses occurring in the
world.

By definition, [transferring weapons to human rights abusers **does not
help fight** human rights **abuse**]{.underline}. Yet, the
[Biden]{.underline} administration [[continues to **tout**]{.mark} a
[**foreign policy**]{.mark} supposedly [based on **h**]{.mark}**uman

The [administration [cannot have it **both ways**. It can choose

A. Geopolitical Considerations with Respect to Egypt

[A **key consideration** that makes **[Egypt]{.mark}** a **crucial

miles, [the [**Suez Canal** is]{.mark} an **[essential]{.mark} link**

the **Mediterranean** and the **Red Seas**, separating **Africa** from

lanes]{.mark} in the world.]{.underline} 136For decades, [Egypt has been
[**crucial** for moving]{.mark} American **military [assets]{.mark}**
through the region, as it gives the U.S. preferential passage through
the canal]{.underline}. 137Geography also [[empowers Egypt with]{.mark}
respect to its **[proximity to Israel]{.mark}**.]{.underline} 138The
eastern border of the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula borders Israel. One city
in particular, Rafah, borders the Gaza Strip, [making it the only
**operational border** crossing between **Egypt** and the **Palestinian
territories**.]{.underline} 139Because of the longstanding relationship
between the U.S., Egypt, and Israel, the three countries have
historically come to agreement on how \"operational\" that border
crossing is. 140For example, [the Agreement on Movement and Access
(AMA): Agreed Principles for Rafah Crossing [allows **EU monitors** to
be **present**]{.mark} and Israeli officials to oversee the crossing via
video surveillance]{.underline}. 141Moreover, [[**Egypt** and **Israel
cooperate** in **fighting terrorism**]{.mark} in the Sinai Peninsula,
which **benefits U.S. counterterrorism** efforts in the **Mid**dle
**East**.]{.underline} 142Finally, [Egypt\'s deployment of troops to
Kuwait during the First Gulf War served as a \"pan-Arab blessing for the
\[U.S.-led\] operation]{.underline},\" which did not go unnoticed by the
Bush administration (41), marking one of the high points of the two
countries\' relationship. 143These [considerations would certainly [make

Americans are not enthusiastic about President [Biden's upcoming trip to
the Middle East]{.underline}, his first since winning the White House.
In a recent poll, just a quarter of those surveyed liked the idea of the
visit; a third disliked it. (Presumably the other 40 percent or so don't
care one way or the other.) The main reason for the high negatives: His
[**stop-off** in **Saudi Arabia**]{.underline}.

During the 2020 election, [[Biden]{.mark} promised to regard Saudi as a
"**pariah**" nation in stark contrast to]{.underline} President
[Trump]{.underline}, who treated the royal family as beloved relatives
and waved away its assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, an American
resident, as an irrelevancy in the face of lucrative arms purchases.
Secretary of State Antony [Blinken]{.underline}, in his first major
speech, one month into Biden's term, [**[pledged]{.mark}** that the
administration's **[fo]{.mark}reign [po]{.mark}licy** would be
"[**centered** on]{.mark} the **defense** of **democracy** and the
**protection** of **[h]{.mark}uman [r]{.mark}ights**.]{.underline}"

Yet [Biden [flies off to Riyadh]{.mark} this month]{.underline}, and,
whatever nobler reasons have been conjured for the visit, the real one
is to ask the Royals [to [open]{.mark} their **[oil]{.mark} spigots**,
in order [to **reduce gas prices**]{.mark}]{.underline} (and thus reduce
inflation) [while allowing the West to maintain its ban on crude from
Russia]{.underline}.

The situation is [**reminiscent** of Biden's **relationship** with
**China**]{.underline}. Early in his term, [the president said he would
hold Beijing "**accountable**" for its gross **h**uman-**r**ights
**violations**. Yet]{.underline} last week, in a five-hour meeting,
[Blinken [urged China]{.mark}'s foreign minister [to join
America]{.mark}'s side [in defending Ukraine]{.mark} from Russia's
aggression.]{.underline}

The point here is not to play gotcha games. Nor is it to argue that the
U.S. foreign policy should be based on lofty ideals or hard-headed
interests but not both. However, [Biden and Blinken [**erred** in
**declaring**]{.mark} that their **[fo]{.mark}reign [po]{.mark}licy**
[would be]{.mark} "**[centered]{.mark}**" [on **democracy** and
**h**]{.mark}**uman [r]{.mark}ights**]{.underline}---[a choice that was
bound to make life more difficult as they [**inevitably** sought
**coop**]{.mark}**eration** [with **authoritarian
regimes**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

There are four reasons why indulging in that rhetoric was a mistake.

First, they must have known that, [at some point, they would **have to
saddle up** with **disreputable leaders**]{.underline}---[if just to
choose the **lesser** of **two evils**]{.underline}---and that, by doing
so, [they would be [accused of **hypocrisy**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

There are often very good reasons for allying with bad people. During
World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill formed a
powerful alliance with Josef Stalin in order to beat Adolf Hitler; if
they hadn't, on the grounds that Stalin was also evil, then Nazi Germany
would have conquered all of Europe.

In less extreme circumstances, [world leaders have often **contained
rivals** while cooperating with them where their **interests
converge**]{.underline}. During the Cold War, the U.S. and the Soviet
Union engaged in an arms race and proxy wars while also negotiating
arms-control treaties, keeping nuclear weapons out of other countries'
hands, and jointly developing a smallpox vaccine, among other good
deeds. Questions of democracy and anti-democracy had nothing to do with
any of it.

Second, [[highlighting]{.mark} our **[differences]{.mark}** with
**authoritarian countries**, much less **[underlining]{.mark}** those
**[differences]{.mark}** as the core of our foreign policy, may have
[made **cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}---when it's possible and
where it matters---[**[harder]{.mark}** to **achieve**]{.underline}.
[Would]{.underline} China's [Xi]{.underline} Jinping be more [amenable
to ditching Russia and helping Ukraine if he didn't think that sticking
by Vladimir Putin would hurt the U.S.? And would he be less keen on
hurting the U.S. if Biden hadn't declared the very nature of China's
government to be a threat?]{.underline} I don't know the answers---but
these seem like a reasonable questions.

Meanwhile, by denouncing Saudi Arabia as "pariah" state (however
justifiably), has [Biden [made it harder]{.mark}]{.underline} for the
royal family [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[supply more
oil]{.underline}]{.mark}**? Has he [given the Saudis **more leverage**
in demanding returns for the favor?]{.underline}

The third problem with declaring that human rights will be the
centerpiece of your foreign policy is that, [[once we **side**
with]{.mark} an [**authoritarian** who **violates**]{.mark} them on some
**[issue]{.mark}**, our **criticisms** [of]{.mark} some [**other
violator** **won't be taken**]{.mark}
**[seriously]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And after that, much of what we say
about foreign policy will be regarded with suspicion, if not cynicism.
[Biden has said he plans to talk sternly to his Saudi hosts about human
rights]{.underline}. He will no doubt be sincere, but [it's **unlikely**
that his **hosts** will **take a word** of it
**seriously**]{.underline}.

Finally, [centering our foreign policy---staking our global
standing---on the triumph of democracy and human rights may not be a
winning strategy]{.underline} these days. According to Freedom House,
[just 20 percent of the world's population is living in a "free
country." Can we form an effective alliance against the other 80
percent?]{.underline}

Besides, [the U.S. isn't quite the beacon of democracy that it once
was]{.underline}. Several times since entering office, Biden has
declared that, in its competition with authoritarianism (especially
China), the U.S. has to show that democratic governments can "do big
things." Yet [[**Congress** is]{.mark} so **[deadlocked]{.mark}**, the
**Supreme [Court]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} so [**at odds** with
**public**]{.mark} **opinion**, and **politics** and **society** are so
**out of alignment** on so many issues that we're on the verge of
showing that we can't do much after all.]{.underline} To the extent that
democracy is still valued in the world, [[the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[is
no longer]{.mark} widely seen as [a model]{.mark} to
emulate]{.underline}.

This is key. In 1994, on his 90th birthday, George Kennan, the architect
of America's Cold War containment policy, said in a speech looking back
on his life and career, "It is primarily by example, never by precept,
that a country such as ours exerts its most useful influence beyond its
borders." As if on cue, late last year, after Biden assembled a fairly
useless Summit for Democracy, the editors of [Politico asked 18
activists in endangered democracies, from Iraq to Poland to India, what
Biden should do to help democracy in their countries. The [majority
replied,]{.mark} essentially: **[Don't lecture us]{.mark}; clean up your
own problems; become a role model again**]{.underline}.

So, should Biden be traveling to Saudi Arabia? Trump made a huge mistake
in dismissing Khashoggi's murder as a trifle---not just as a moral
matter but for reasons that any viewer of The Godfather would
understand: No prince in a foreign family can be allowed to get away
with killing one of our own. Trump should have turned on the pressure,
cut off oil imports (when we were in a position to do so), stepped up
intel ops against Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (who, according to a
U.S. intelligence report, personally approved the murder)---everything
possible to make sure that everyone saw this as unacceptable.

Alas, it's a bit late for that now. MBS is more deeply ensconced in
Riyadh's power structure, our leverage on energy supplies is diminished,
and so is our leverage in the new Middle Eastern politics, where the
Sunni nations---Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain,
and Kuwait---have formed a coalition with Israel, for the common
containment of Iran, quite apart from any involvement, much less
leadership, from Washington.

None of this should be read as a defense of ultra-Realpolitik thinking.
Our interests mean little without the underlying strength of our values.
Our foreign policy should focus, whenever possible, on making the world
safer for democracy. It should stand with democratic countries in every
forum and conflict. It should speak out on behalf of democratic causes
around the world. However, [[it is **impractical**]{.mark}---in some
instances, it has been and would be **counterproductive**---[to place
**democratic values** at]{.mark} the [**center** of **foreign
policy**]{.mark}, to make a country's democratic practices the measure
of whether we should side with that country on any issue.]{.underline}

[Sometimes **we don't have the power** to **insist** that a **country
follow** our **example**]{.underline}. And [sometimes, these days, [our
example **doesn't**]{.mark} **have the power to [inspire]{.mark}**
anyone to follow us]{.underline}. That's what we truly need to focus on.

[The democratic peace]{.underline}---the observation that democracies
are less likely to fight each other than are other pairings of
states---[is one of the most widely acknowledged empirical regularities
in international relations. Prominent scholars have even characterized
the relationship as an empirical law]{.underline} (Levy 1988; Gleditsch
1992). The discovery of a special peace in liberal dyads stimulated
enormous scholarly debate and led to, or reinforced, a number of policy
initiatives by various governments and international organizations.
Although a broad consensus has emerged among researchers regarding the
empirical correlation between joint democracy and peace, disagreement
remains as to its logical foundations. Numerous theories have been
proposed to account for how democracy produces peace, if only dyadically
(e.g., Russett 1993; Rummel 1996; Doyle 1997; Schultz 2001).

[At the **same time**, peace appears likely to foster or maintain
democracy]{.underline} (Thompson 1996; James, Solberg, andWolfson 1999).
A vast swath of research in political science and economics proposes
explanations for the origins of liberal government involving variables
such as economic development (Lipset 1959; Burkhart and Lewis-Beck 1994;
Przeworski et al. 2000; Acemoglu and Robinson 2006; Epstein et al. 2006)
and inequality (Boix 2003), political interests (Downs 1957; Bueno de
Mesquita et al. 2003), power hierarchies (Moore 1966; Lake 2009), third
party inducements (Pevehouse 2005) or impositions (Peceny 1995; Meernik
1996), geography (Gleditsch 2002b), and natural resource endowments
(Ross 2001), to list just a few examples. [Each]{.underline} of these
putative **[cause]{.underline}**s [of democracy is **also** associated
with various explanations for international conflict]{.underline}.
Indeed, some as yet poorly defined set of canonical factors may
contribute both to democracy and to peace, [making it **look** as if the
two variables are **directly related**, **even if possibly they are
not**]{.underline}.

We seek to contribute to this literature, not by proposing yet another
theory to explain how democracy vanquishes war, but by estimating the
causal effect of joint democracy on the probability of militarized
disputes using a quasi-experimental research design. We begin by noting
that [some of the **common causes** of democracy and peace may be
**unobservable**, generating an **endogenous relations**hip between the
two. Theories of democracy and explanations for peace are at a
**formative state**; it is **not possible** to utilize detailed,
validated and widely accepted models of each of these processes to
assess their interaction]{.underline}. Indeed, [to a **remarkable
degree** democracy and peace each remain **poorly understood** and
**weakly accounted** for **empirically**, despite their central roles in
international politics. We address the risk of spurious correlation by
applying an **instrumental variables approach**. Having **taken into
account possible endogeneity** between democracy and peace, we find that
joint democracy does **not** have **a**n **independent** pacifying
effect on interstate conflict. Instead]{.underline}, our [findings show
that democratic countries are **more likely** to attack other
democracies than are non-democracies]{.underline}. Our [results **call
into question** the]{.underline} large body of [theory that]{.underline}
has been proposed to [account for]{.underline} the [**apparent**
pacifism of democratic dyads]{.underline}.

### 2ac -- democracy bad -- nigeria

#### Democracy causes Nigerian [state collapse]{.underline} and [civil war]{.underline}

Stability", Logos: A Journal of Modern Society & Culture, May 2019,

[In]{.underline} 20[**15**, Nigeria]{.underline}, a country of about 190
million, [spent \$625 million to conduct]{.underline} federal and local
[elections. By comparison, India]{.underline}, with a population of 1.2
billion, [spent \$600 million]{.underline} on its 2015 election,
according to figures released by the Electoral Commission of India
(ECI).\[1\]

In 2019, the election budget of Nigeria's Independent Electoral
Commission (INEC) rose to \$670 million. [This represents about **2.5
percent** of Nigeria's]{.underline} \$28.8 billion [budget]{.underline}
for 2019, a portion of which is being financed through borrowing. To put
the electoral spending in context, [more than half of the country
subsists on about a **dollar a day**]{.underline}, and the country
recently acquired the dubious distinction of being named [the **poverty
capital of the world**]{.underline}, with more people living in extreme
poverty there than in any other country.\[2\] [Key infrastructures and
services]{.underline} such as roads, railway, electricity, water supply,
healthcare, and education [are **severely inadequate**, requiring
**urgent investments**]{.underline} and interventions.

[Election-related expenditure is **expected to rise**]{.underline} in
the near future as INEC implements a wider slate of digital technologies
to combat manipulation and improve the integrity of the electoral
process. For comparison, Nigeria typically devotes about 7 percent of
its budget to education. And yet Nigeria continues to maintain a
four-year election cycle, with smaller by-elections occurring in
between. This electoral calendar guarantees that about \$1 billion is
spent on elections every four years. As the electoral price tag has
grown, democratic dividends have plummeted.

Nigeria's predicament is a microcosm of the phenomenon of rising
financial costs of elections in Africa and diminishing returns on
democracy. Across the continent, [the cost of electoral democracy is
**increasing** and **threatens the delivery of social
goods**]{.underline}. As [African countries battle **myriad
socioeconomic challenges**]{.underline}, the question needs to posed: is
it wise for these countries to continue to spend a large percentage of
their revenue every four or five years on a political ritual with fewer
and fewer positive socioeconomic consequences for their populations? Is
this expensive, periodic democratic ritual called election worth its
price?

[It is not only the monetary cost of elections that now threatens to
**defeat their purpose** and **engender disillusionment** and, along
with disillusionment, the **erosion of trust** in the state and its
ability to **produce** and **distribute** public goods. The **social
cost** of]{.underline} periodic [elections has been]{.underline}
arguably [**great**er, **depleting**, with each election cycle, the
**residual stability** of the state and the **credibility** of its
**institutions**]{.underline}.

[Elections conducted in Nigeria]{.underline} since the return of
civilian rule in 1999 [have brought with them]{.underline} anxiety,
tension, death, **[violence]{.underline}**, and dangerous rhetoric
[that]{.underline}, taken together, have [**frayed** the **national
political and social fabric**. Elections have **widened fissures** and
intensified preexisting **primordial cleavages**]{.underline}.

I can recall no electoral cycle since at least 2003 that was not been
accompanied by fears of Nigeria's disintegration or at the very least
the acceleration of its demise. In 2007 and 2011, post-election violence
claimed hundreds of lives in Northern Nigeria as supporters of then
candidate Muhammadu Buhari rioted after his loss. In the 2019
presidential and national assembly elections, at least 46 people were
reported to have died from election-related violence. In the state
assembly and governorship elections two weeks later on March 9, 2019,
another 10 people died across five states in what the Sunday Tribune
newspaper described in its headline as "another bloody election."\[3\]

Two riders below the same Sunday Tribune headline encapsulate the
turbulent character of Nigerian elections. One was "Thugs, vote buyers,
arsonists take over on election day"; the other was "Nigerians condemn
militarization of elections in Rivers, Bayelsa, Kwara, Akwa Ibom,
Benue," a reference to the government's deployment of soldiers and other
military assets to opposition strongholds before and during the
election. The involvement of soldiers and other military personnel in
the election was a brazen violation of Nigeria's Electoral Act, an
action which many observers interpreted as the incumbent
administration's effort to use its might to manipulate the election in
states held by the opposition.

Every election cycle in Nigeria sees massive, fear-induced demographic
mobility as members of different ethnic groups and religions relocate to
areas considered dominated by their kinsmen and co-religionists to await
[the conclusion of elections]{.underline} that [often degenerate into
**communal clashes** especially in the **volatile north** of the
country]{.underline}.

Periodic [national elections have]{.underline} thus [**worsened**
Nigeria's notoriously **frail union** and caused **apathy** and
**discontent**]{.underline}. The Nigerian people, the major stakeholders
in Nigeria's democracy, have grown weary of being periodically
endangered and rendered pawns in an elaborate elite ritual with little
or no consequence for their lives.

Electoral aftermaths have not improved economic conditions or
strengthened the capacity of citizens to hold elected leaders
accountable. Moreover, as I shall discuss shortly, the familiar abstract
freedoms that democracy, lubricated by periodic elections, can confer on
citizens who participate in such exercises, have eluded Nigerians.

The result has been noticeable apathy represented most poignantly by
voter turnout, which declined from a peak of 69.1 percent in 2003 to
46.3 percent in 2015 and to about 35 percent in 2019. In the same 2019
election cycle, turnout declined to less than 20 percent in the
governorship and state assembly elections, with many Nigerians on social
media stating that they had lost faith in the electoral process and that
the official results of the presidential elections two weeks earlier had
shown that their votes would not count towards the declared outcome.

Voter apathy alone is not an indication of democratic disillusionment
but it can portend or indicate something more devastating: diminishing
trust in the state, its institutions, and its processes.

Such a trust deficit exists already and it predated the return of
civilian rule in 1999 after about two decades of military dictatorship.
However, by all theoretical formulations, such a cumulative loss of
confidence in the transactional sociopolitical contract between the
state and citizens should be corrected by the democratic ideals of
voting, representation, and accountability. This has not happened in
Nigeria. In fact, the opposite scenario is visible: a negative
correlation between successive electoral cycles and citizens' trust in
the Nigerian state. Therein lay the paradoxical consequences of
democratic practice in Nigeria.

[If elections are **increasingly** burdensome as they have become in
Nigeria, the corrective potential of democracy]{.underline}, broadly
speaking, [is lost. Citizens]{.underline} consequently [**lose faith**
in the state and resort to **self-help**]{.underline}, including
criminal self-help. [That is how **states collapse**. Nigeria is **not
far off** this possibility]{.underline}.

In Nigeria, recent political realities reveal a blind spot of
pro-democracy advocacy: without the modulating effect of
decentralization, sustained economic growth, a growing, secure middle
class, and a literate, hopeful poor, liberal democracy can do and has
done more damage than good. [Liberal democracy has ironically become
both an incubator and protector of mediocrity, corruption, and bad
governance. The **overarching casualty** has been Nigeria's **very
stability**]{.underline}.

#### Nigerian instability escalates to [global]{.underline} great power war

Institute, 1/11/2021,
https://www.fpri.org/article/2021/01/does-africa-matter-to-the-united-states/

[**Africa matters** in terms of **size**, **population**, and rate of
**population growth**. It]{.underline} is the continent currently most
affected by climate change but [is]{.underline} also [a continent that
can have a **devastating impact** on **climate change globally** because
of the importance of the **Congo Basin** rainforest, which is the
second-largest absorber of heat after the Amazon rainforest. The
destruction of this important ecosystem could further accelerate
**global warming**]{.underline}. As residents of the region come into
increasing contact with the animals of the rainforest, [this region
could be the origin of the world's next **viral pandemic**. Violent
extremism and terrorism are increasing in Africa, and while now mostly
localized, the danger has the potential to **spread beyond the
continent**. **Crises**]{.underline}---natural and man-made---cause
massive relocations of populations, both on the continent and abroad,
which [can have **negative economic, social, and political
impacts**]{.underline}.

Why Africa Matters

The African continent is the world's second-largest, with the
second-fastest growth rate after Asia. With 54 sovereign countries, four
territories, and two de facto independent states with little
international recognition, the continent has a current population of 1.3
billion. By 2050, the continent's population is predicted to rise to 2.4
billion. By 2100, [**Nigeria**, Africa's most populous country, will
have a population of **one billion**]{.underline}, and half the world's
population growth will be in Africa by then.

The population of African countries is also overwhelmingly young.
Approximately 40% of Africans are under 15, and, in some countries, over
50% is under 25. By 2050, two of every five children born in the world
will be in Africa, and the continent's population is expected to triple.
These developments have positive and negative potential impacts on the
United States and the rest of the world. Young Africans have, for the
most part, completely skipped the analog age and gone directly digital.
Comfortable with technology, they form a huge potential consumer and
labor market. [If]{.underline}, on the other hand, the [countries of
Africa fail to develop economically]{.underline} and do not create
gainful employment for this young population, then there is the risk
that [they will become a huge potential source of recruits to extremist
and terrorist movements]{.underline}, which currently target
disadvantaged and disenchanted youth.

Lack of economic opportunity, increased urbanization, and climate-fueled
disasters will also contribute to movement of people seeking better
lives, which will impact economies and security not only on the
continent of Africa, but also the economic and security situations
around the world. [Nations, lacking]{.underline} adequate critical
infrastructure, education, and [**job opportunities** are ripe for
**internal unrest** and **radicalization**]{.underline}. In particular,
inadequate health delivery systems, when coupled with natural disasters,
such as droughts or floods that limit food production, cause famine and
mass movements of populations.

The Challenges for U.S. Policy

Prior to World War II, the U.S. policy towards Africa was not as active
as it was toward Europe, Asia, or Latin America. During the Cold War,
Africa policy was primarily viewed from a perspective of super-power
competition. The end of the Cold War and the rise of international
terrorism introduced this as a major component in U.S. Africa policy
along with competition with a rising China and increased Chinese
engagement in Africa.

Before his first official trip to Kenya, U.S. President Barack Obama
said, "Africa had become an idea more than an actual place . . . with
the benefit of distance, we engaged Africa in a selective embrace." This
is probably an apt description of U.S. policy towards African nations
despite the bipartisan nature of that policy. The United States, with
the many domestic and international issues it has to cope with, can ill
afford to continue to ignore Africa. Going forward, U.S. policy must
include a hard-headed look at where Africa fits in policy priorities.

The incoming Biden administration will face a number of important issues
and challenges as it develops its Africa policy. The most pressing
issues are the following:

Climate Change: Climate change is an existential problem that affects
the entire globe, but Africa has probably suffered more from the effects
of climate change than other continents---and the problem will only get
worse with time. In an October 2020 article, World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said,

Climate change is having a growing impact on the African continent,
hitting the most vulnerable hardest, and contributing to food
insecurity, population displacement and stress on water resources. In
recent months we have seen devastating floods, an invasion of desert
locusts and now face the looming specter of drought because of a La Nina
event. The human and economic toll has been aggravated by the COVID-19
pandemic.

Climate change impacts water quality and availability, and millions in
Africa will likely face persistent increased water stress due to these
impacts. A multi-year drought in parts of South Africa, for instance,
threatened total water failure in several small towns and had livestock
farmers facing financial ruin. Another pressing climate-change issue is
the need for protection of the Congo Basin rainforest. This
178-million-hectare rainforest is the world's second largest after the
Amazon and is currently threatened by agricultural activities in
Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo,
Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. Countries in the
Congo Basin need to address the preservation issue, while also enabling
sustainable agricultural activities to ensure food security for the
region's population. In addition to the impact on global climate caused
by destruction of the rainforest, such destruction also brings human
populations into closer contact with the region's animals, creating the
risk of future animal-to-human transmission of new and possibly more
virulent viruses similar to COVID-19, which will have a global impact.
In a January 2021 CNN report, Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe Tamfum, who as a
researcher helped discover the Ebola virus in 1976, warned of possible
new pathogens that could be as infectious as COVID-19 and as virulent as
Ebola.

Rule of Law/Mitigation of Corruption: A key to African development,
given the increasing urbanization, population increases, and
youthfulness of the continent's population, will be an increase in
domestic and international investment to build the industries that can
provide meaningful employment and improved standards of living. In order
for this to be successful, African nations will need to address the
issues of rule of law and corruption. Investors will not risk money if
the business climate comes with a level of political risk that is too
high. Government leaders throughout Africa need to establish legislation
that provides an acceptable level of security for investments and take
action to curb the endemic corruption that currently discourages
investment. Corruption in Africa ranges from wholesale political
corruption on the scale of General Sani Abachi's looting of \$3-5
billion of state money during his five years as Nigeria's military ruler
to the bribes paid by businessmen to police and customs officials. The
"tradition" of having to pay bribes, or "sweeteners," drives away
domestic investment and scares away foreign investment, leaving many
countries mired in poverty.

Violent Extremism and Terrorism: A number of African nations are
currently plagued with rising extremist movements. While primarily a
domestic issue, the mass movement of people fleeing violence and the
disruption of economic activity have the potential to negatively impact
the rest of the world. African nations need regional responses to curb
extremist and terrorist organizations, many of which are supported by
international terrorist organizations, such as ISIS and al Qaeda. In
addition, the underlying conditions that helped to create these
movements must be addressed. [Terrorist groups in Africa range from
relatively large and dangerous groups, such as Boko Haram]{.underline},
a group [in **Nigeria**]{.underline} that has received support from al
Qaeda and that aims to implement sharia law in the country; Al-Shabab,
an al Qaeda affiliate aiming to overthrow the government in Somalia and
to punish neighboring countries for their support of the Somali regime;
and Uganda's Lord's Resistance Army, a fundamentalist Christian group.
Terrorist groups in the fragile political climate of Libya also pose a
threat to sub-Saharan Africa.

**[Great Power Competition]{.underline}**: As the world's second-largest
economy, and with its increasing participation in international
activities, [**China** will continue to be a factor in Africa for the
foreseeable future]{.underline}. This, however, is more a problem for
the nations of Africa than it is for the rest of the world. The West can
compete best by outperforming China in areas of strength by providing
those goods and services that are unquestionably superior, and let
African governments decide how to deal with China and its
often-predatory lending practices and the Chinese tendency to import
Chinese workers for its projects and investments rather than hiring
locals. At the same time, Russia, which did not completely turn away
from Africa at the end of the Cold War as many in the West sometimes
believe, must still be considered a significant factor on the African
landscape. In an effort to compensate for Western sanctions and to
counter U.S. and Western influence, [**Russia** is once again increasing
its presence on the continent]{.underline}. Russian mercenaries, in
exchange for diamond mining rights, have trained military forces in the
Central African Republic, raising concerns about human rights abuses. Of
particular concern is the presence of the Wagner Group, a private
military company associated with Yevgeny Progozhin, a Russian oligarch
with close ties to Vladimir Putin, who was indicted in the United States
for trying to disrupt the 2016 U.S. elections. To date, Russia has, in
addition to seeking basing rights, signed military cooperation
agreements with 28 African nations. Russian activity is a combination of
military and commercial, with Progozhin at the center of both. From 2010
to 2018, Russia nearly tripled its trade with African countries. While
the activities of both Russia and China in Africa are of concern, and
should be closely monitored, neither is of critical importance to U.S.
national security.

With climate change, disease outbreaks, famine, extremism, and
inter-ethnic violence, Africa will still experience crises in the
foreseeable future that will be beyond the capacity of most nations on
the continent to deal with. Climate change is probably the greatest
cause of humanitarian crises in Africa, but mainstream media outside the
continent either fail to notice or under-report them. Some of the
[crises]{.underline}, like Ebola or the next viral infection, [can
**impact** the **rest of the world**]{.underline}. These crises will
cause starvation, mass movement of people, and increase internal and
regional instability. [Africa matters to the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and the **rest of the world**. Its impacts can
be felt **far beyond the continent's borders**]{.underline}, but if
approached as a partner rather than as a patron---with a focus on
assisting African nations to improve governance, build critical
infrastructure, boost domestic economies, and provide essential services
to all---then Africa can be a positive contributor on the global stage.

Introduction

Whether [liberal **democracy** contributed to]{.underline} the
**[COVID]{.underline}**-19 [governance]{.underline} was a hot topic in
2020 ("Democracy and Rise of Authoritarianism in COVID-19 World", 2020).
At the end of January, 2020, [when **COVID**]{.underline}-19 [witnessed
the lockdown of Wuhan]{.underline} City, [the West]{.underline}
generally [agreed that China lacked **freedom**]{.underline} of speech
and the inertia of a rigid bureaucratic structure, and the national
censorship system kept the whistle blower Dr. Wenliang Li silent, which
led to the disease out of control (Mérieau, 2020). Democracies'
confidence mainly came from Amartya Sen's research on the famine.
[Sen]{.underline} (1999) has [claimed]{.underline} that no substantial
famine has ever occurred in any independent and democratic country with
a relatively free press and there is no exception to this rule. Citizens
in [democracies]{.underline} can [expect governments to be]{.underline}
more [**candid**, transparent, and **responsible**]{.underline} in
dealing with all kinds of crises, which authoritarian countries usually
cannot (Berengaut, 2020; Bollyky & Kickbusch, 2020). So Steve
[Bloomfield]{.underline} (2020) has [regarded that if China had a free
press and transparent government, the pandemic could be brought under
control before the outbreak. In conclusion,]{.underline} freedom plus
[democracy equals the **COVID**]{.underline}-19
**[antidote]{.underline}** according to Western standards, although
Wilson and Wisongye have found that social media rumors can exploit the
right to freedom of speech and erode people's health benefits (New York
Times, 2021; Bollyky & Kickbusch, 2020). [However]{.underline}, since
March, 2020, [with Western democracies]{.underline} seriously [affected
by **COVID**]{.underline}-19, [their superiority of the political system
has begun to **expose** its untrue and **fatal defects**]{.underline}.
Especially when Wuhan began to lift its blockade on April 8, 2020
(People.cn, 2020), [scholars]{.underline} and journalists [began to
question whether democracies had the **ability** to **deal with the
crisis**]{.underline} better than China (Mérieau, 2020). [Liberal
democracy]{.underline} in the United States [has not proved]{.underline}
that it is [more conducive]{.underline} to the COVID-19 governance [than
authoritarianism]{.underline} since 2020. [From a global perspective,
not only do **most democracies fail to contain**]{.underline} the
**[spread]{.underline}** of COVID-19, but almost [**all of the 10 most
affected** countries are **liberal democracies**]{.underline}
(Coronavirus Resource Center, 2021). [Their **policy responses** have a
**poor effect** in reducing the **death toll** in **early stages** of
the crisis, as shown that democratic political institutions may be at a
**disadvantage** in **responding quickly**]{.underline} to COVID-19
(Cepaluni, Dorsch, & Branyiczki, 2020). More surprising is that the
COVID-19 pandemic is so serious in the United States, yet no government
officials have been removed from office because of their inactivity in
fighting against the corona-virus. People doubt whether American
accountability mechanism is still working. However, two impeachments
against President Trump indicate that it seems to function quite well
(Valenta & Valenta, 2017; Herb, Raju, Fox, & Mattingly, 2021). The
direct loss to the United States caused by Russiagate and incitement of
insurrection is far less than the pain caused by the failure of the
COVID-19 governance, but no any official in the United States is
responsible for it. [If it **again** faces infectious diseases
**similar** to **COVID**]{.underline}-19, [will it **repeat** this
**unprecedented tragedy**]{.underline}? Can liberal democracy and the
separation and balance of powers push American president to act more
aggressively? [Error-tolerantism explains that the fundamental reason
for the failure of]{.underline} American [COVID]{.underline}-19
[governance is a **serious misunderstanding** of the concept of
**freedom**]{.underline} (Zhou, 2018; 2019; Zhou, Tan, & Liu, 2020).
Liberalism has witnessed a rare scene: In the context of COVID-19, the
president, governors, magistrates, and the public (Emery, Schwebke, &
Park, 2020; Sullum, 2020; Behrmann, 2020; Kenton, 2020; Strano, 2020)
have severe misunderstanding of freedom [that cost **more
than**]{.underline} American **[600,000 lives]{.underline}**
(Coronavirus Resource Center, 2021).

In response to the above phenomenon, error-tolerantism as the
development of liberalism defines liberty from a new perspective and
shows a stronger explanatory power than liberalism (Zhou et al., 2020).
The right paradigm of error-tolerantism, the right to be wrong (right to
trial and error) as an original right and mutual empowerment theory,
instead of natural rights theory and social contract theory, divides
liberty into the right to liberty in innovative fields, right to be
wrong as an original right, and the right to be right in non-innovative
fields as sub-rights. The lockdown of Wuhan means that Chinese
government has excised the power to be wrong as an original power, but
the West criticized it with the right to liberty at the level of
sub-rights, which is the first error in understanding liberty during
American COVID-19 governance; after Wuhan effectively controlled
COVID-19, its governance has transformed from an innovative field to a
non-innovative one. Then, liberties in non-innovative fields as the
sub-rights level, such as wearing face masks, keeping social distancing,
showing health codes, are formed definitely (Zhou et al., 2020).
However, [**wearing masks** has been regarded as a sign of **political
oppression** rather than a simple hygienic measure by the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates (Kahanel, 2021). Since
liberalism has a major misunderstanding of the concept of liberty,
[liberal democracy]{.underline} based on the philosophy of liberalism
[should be]{.underline} deeply reflected or even
**[reconstructed]{.underline}**, and it is very reasonable for
error-tolerant democracy constructed based on error-tolerantism [to
explore the defects]{.underline} of liberal democracy [in]{.underline}
American [COVID]{.underline}-19 [governance]{.underline}. Therefore, we
first review scholars' relevant research on American democracy and the
COVID-19 governance, and then based on the theory of error-tolerant
democracy, discuss [the **defects** of]{.underline} liberal
**[democracy]{.underline}** and American political system that [are
**unable to cope** with the **crisis of the century**]{.underline}.

1 INTRODUCTION

[Our world is vulnerable to global catastrophic risks]{.underline}
(GCRs) [or existential risks]{.underline} (Bostrom, 2019; Ord, 2020).
[**GCRs** are so disastrous because they affect one or more systems
**critical to humanity**, and **spread** to affect the **entire
planet**]{.underline} (Avin et al., 2018). Existential risks threaten to
eliminate humanity or permanently curtail its potential (Ord, 2020).
Some of these [risks are **natural**, for example]{.underline} asteroid
or comet impact, supervolcanic eruption, [naturally occurring
**pandemic**]{.underline}, or various cosmic events (Bostrom & Cirkovic,
2008; Ord, 2020). Many others are the result of human activities, for
example nuclear war, anthropogenic climate change, nonaligned artificial
intelligence, engineered biological threats, geoengineering, or
inescapable totalitarianism (Bostrom & Cirkovic, 2008; Ord, 2020).

There are three phases to an existential catastrophe: origin, scale up,
and reaching every last human (Cotton-Barratt, Daniel, & Sandberg,
2020). Following any near miss, there would be a period where recovery
of humanity\'s long-term potential may or may not be realized (Baum et
al., 2019). [Failure to]{.underline} anticipate or [**mitigate** these
threats risks **undesirable trajectories** for **human
civilization**]{.underline} (Baum et al., 2019).

In addition to the present generation\'s obvious self-interest in
continuing to exist, the perspective of long-termism suggests that
humanity ought to mitigate these risks due to the potential immense
value of future human generations (Beckstead, 2013), a desire to see
aspects of the human project continue across time and perhaps the
universe (Bostrom, 2003; Scheffler, 2013), and the potential cosmic
significance of preserving intelligent life on Earth (Ord, 2020). A
number of philosophical defenses of long-termism have been published
(Beckstead, 2013; Greaves & MacAskill, 2019). Importantly, these
long-term outcomes are largely under human control because most of the
risk is probably anthropogenic (Beard & Torres, 2020; Ord, 2020).

1.1 Mitigating Existential Threats

It is too simplistic to think of existential risks as mere causes that
are followed by a sequence of effects. We should think of risks as the
product of hazards, vulnerabilities, and exposures (Liu, Lauta, & Maas,
2018). [Hazards are the **precipitating cause** of a
**catastrophe**]{.underline}, vulnerabilities are the inability of
critical systems to withstand hazards, and exposures are the features of
human society that turn this system damage into harm to populations
(Beard & Torres, 2020). [Mitigation of existential threats involves
preventing their emergence, **responding** if the threat spreads, and
building **resilience** so the threat does **not** lead to the death of
**every last human** or leave humanity with **permanently curtailed**
prospects]{.underline} (Cotton-Barratt et al., 2020). After a threat has
passed, there may also be a series of limiters that might prevent the
reemergence of a flourishing humanity (Baum et al., 2019). One such
limiting factor could be the loss of technological society and know-how.

In order to achieve immunity from existential threat, humanity will need
a period where it preserves its potential and protects itself from risks
(Ord, 2020). Various methods have been proposed to address
vulnerabilities and hence shift the probability of existential risk.
These suggestions include: improved international focus, governance, and
cooperation such as through the United Nations (Boyd & Wilson, 2020),
imitating existing frameworks such as the Sendai framework for disaster
risk reduction (Avin et al., 2018), achieving the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals (Cernev & Fenner, 2020), or extreme
surveillance for threats (Bostrom, 2019). Toby Ord lists 38 specific
measures across eight existential threats, and an additional 12 avenues
to explore that address risks in general terms (Ord, 2020).

1.2 Biological Threats

[**Pandemic viruses** with **high case fatality** could potentially
infect a **majority** of the population. Deliberate biological events
(DBEs) have occurred before]{.underline} (Millet & Snyder-Beattie,
2017a), [will **likely occur again**, and could pose a **threat** to
humans as great as **nuclear war**]{.underline} (Kosal, 2020). [New
**tech**]{.underline}nologies [such as **a**]{.underline}rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence [could **amplify biothreats** in a number
of ways]{.underline} (O\'Brien & Nelson, 2020). [These risks are
**increased** because the]{.underline} Biological Weapons Convention
[(BWC) has no verification system]{.underline} (Dando, 2016), [and has
been violated in the past]{.underline} (Gronvall, 2018). [It would
**only** take **one** unanticipated or **accidental event** for a
**bioweapon** (or **lab**]{.underline}oratory [accident) to **be**come a
**catastrophic threat**]{.underline}. The U.S. National Academies of
Sciences specifically warns against synthetic biology and xenobiology
(Gomez-Tatay & Hernandez-Andreu, 2019) and it is argued that [a
state-sponsored bioweapon attack is the **greatest current
threat**]{.underline} (Sandberg & Nelson, 2020). See the Supporting
Information for further details on biological threats. Global
preparedness through the One Health approach, global health security
projects, and the need to integrate health and the GCR field (Millet &
Snyder-Beattie, 2017b) are important. But as the COVID-19 pandemic has
shown, there may be important overlooked aspects or misunderstood risks
that could make any suite of general preparation inadequate. Therefore,
last lines of defense may be required, such as refuges.

### 2ac -- democracy bad -- warming

#### [Existential]{.underline} warming is [inevitable]{.underline} AND causes a [collapse]{.underline} into [extreme]{.underline} authoritarianism\-\--[only]{.underline} transitioning from democracy solves

Dr. Chien-Yi **Lu 21**, PhD and MA in Government from the University of
Texas, Austin, Visiting Scholar at Harvard University, Associate
Research Fellow at the Institute of European and American Studies of
Academia Sinica, Surviving Democracy: Mitigating Climate Change in a
Neoliberalized World, Paperback Edition, 12/13/2021, p. 1-2

The fact [that]{.underline} the [scientific knowledge on the human
contribution to climate change entered human society
through]{.underline} the most advanced [democratic societies **should
have been** a cause for celebration. Given the **congruence** of climate
mitigation and public interests]{.underline}, the problem of [climate
change should have been considered solved decades ago. **Several decades
of inaction** later, however, arguments are proliferating that
**democracy** is **exactly the reason** for **inaction**]{.underline}.

In The Collapse of Western Civilization, historians Naomi Oreskes and
Erik Conway travel to the future to look back and offer a forensic
analysis on the climate-induced Great Collapse of Western Civilization
of 2074 (2014: 63). The future historians' forensic report states that
["\[a\]s the **devastating effects** of the **Great
Collapse**]{.underline} began to [appear]{.underline}, the
nation-[states with democratic governments... were]{.underline} at first
[**unwilling** and then **unable**" to **deal** with the
crisis]{.underline}. These [democratic governments]{.underline} realized
that they [had no "**infrastructure** and **organization**al ability to
**quarantine** and **relocate**]{.underline} people" [as "**food
shortages** and **disease outbreaks** spread and **sea level\[s\]
rose**."]{.underline} In China, [where there was **centralized**
government, the crisis was handled **much more adequately**, leading to
**survival**]{.underline} rates exceeding 80%, a development [that
"**vindicated** the **necessity** of **centralized**
government"]{.underline} (2014: 51--2). The gist of The Collapse of
Western Civilization is not about critiquing democracy per se but a
warning against the [stubborn inaction]{.underline} mandated by market
fundamentalism that [has **hijacked** Western democracies]{.underline}.1
In their previous book, Merchants of Doubt, Oreskes and Conway
documented the way that [climate deniers **sow**]{.underline}ed the
[seeds of doubt about climate]{.underline} change [and]{.underline}
successfully **[stave]{.underline}**d [off implementations of mitigation
measures]{.underline}. For the authors, the anticommunist ideology that
had kept actors vigilant about government encroachment in the
marketplace occupied a central place in climate denial (2014: 69).
Ironically, [this]{.underline} sort of ideology-informed calculation
meant [that preventative action was **blocked**, increasing the risk
that **disruptive climate disasters** would **eventually necessitate the
suspension of democracy** and **legitimating the sort of heavy-handed
authoritarian interventions that the conservatives most
abhorred**]{.underline} (2014: 52; 69).

[An appeal to **suspend democracy for the sake of
survival**]{.underline} can be found in The Climate Change Challenge and
the Failure of Democracy, where Shearman and Smith argue that [liberal
democracy is **incompatible** with the **urgent necessity** to prevent
**catastrophic climate change**]{.underline}. The vested interests of
politicians, corporations, and media lie in continuing with business as
usual and in keeping the public ignorant. Instead of bottom-up reforms
to improve democracy and bring about sensible climate policies,
[Shearman and Smith see a **transformation** in**to** **authoritarian
regimes** as the **only responsible way forward** when faced with the
**extreme ecological stress** of climate change]{.underline}. They point
out that, as Plato foresaw, [those in power in a democracy are seldom
able to **resist the demands of the populace** for long, but as a mass,
the populace is **seldom able to focus** on **complex problems** and to
perceive threats that lie **over the horizon**]{.underline}. Hence,
[those able to see **further**]{.underline}---scientists, experts, and
the knowledgeable--- [should be entrusted with steering the course while
there is **still time** to **avoid disaster**]{.underline}. It is only
under a benign authoritarian rule of the knowledgeable that a saner,
fairer, and more rational means of weighing social goods against evils
can be introduced (Shearman and Smith, 2007).

#### The public is an idiocracy. 'Pressure' cannot be productive.

Philosophy and Education at London\'s Institute of Education, South Bank

Problem With Democracy --- It\'s You", The Article, 10/5/2020,
https://www.thearticle.com/the-problem-with-democracy-its-you

So [why is]{.underline} our [democracy **so unfit** for purpose? Why is
it that we can elect leaders who are **little more** than **self-serving
schemers**, whose **contempt** for the electorate renders them
**incapable** of giving **straight, honest answers** to even the **most
straightforward**, reasonable questions? It's not as if any of these
qualities have been smuggled in under our noses. They are
**paraded**]{.underline} before our eyes every single day. [Nobody
voting for]{.underline} Johnson or [**Trump** could]{.underline} ~~be
blind to the fact~~ [\[ignore\] that they are **serial liars**. And yet
they **voted all the same**. Why?]{.underline}

\*\*\*

Mencken was on to something when suggesting that [the leaders we get,
the leaders we deserve, closely **represent something dark** in the
**inner soul** of the people. There's no easy way to put this --- **the
problem with democracy is the voters**. The voters simply aren't good
enough to support a healthy democracy]{.underline}. They're not up to
the job. Now I know some will think: a snowflake-remainer-lefty-loser
will always blame the voters just as a bad workman always blames his
tools. But these tools are shot.

[Consider this: a poll]{.underline} in 2005 [found that 21 per cent of
Americans believe in **witches** and 9 per cent that spirits can take
control of a person]{.underline}. In 1999, [18 per cent believed the sun
revolves around the earth]{.underline} --- so much for "the science" ---
and in 2000, 31 per cent believed in ghosts, and increase of 20
percentage points since 1978.

By 2019, the year before Trump's re-election attempt, [significant
numbers **believe**d in the **illuminati**, **Big-foot** and a **flat
earth**. Ghost-belief had **risen** to **45 per cent**]{.underline}, as
had the belief in demons. [Belief in **vampires** stood at a
**fangtastic** 13 per cent]{.underline}.

Britain has nothing to be proud of. While 33 per cent of us believe in
ghosts and 18 per cent in demonic possession, a whopping 52 per cent of
us believe that you can magically make a false claim true simply by
writing it on the side of a bus.

In elective dictatorships where small margins have huge consequences
we'd better get used to the fact that (possibly [small) groups with
**stupid ideas** and a **lack of relevant knowledge** and
**skills**]{.underline} can [have a **disproportionate
effect**]{.underline} on the lives of the rest of us.

### \-\-- 1ar -- xt: no dpt / causes war

#### This is true in [all scenarios]{.underline}, including against [other]{.underline} democracies

of Iowa, "Make Two Democracies and Call Me in the Morning: Endogenous
Regime Type and the Democratic Peace", 2/19/2021,
https://dainachiba.github.io/research/make2dem/Make2Dem.pdf

[We]{.underline} now [turn to]{.underline} the [results from the outcome
stage, where]{.underline} militarized [conflict]{.underline} initiation
[is regressed on democracy]{.underline} measures and other covariates.
[The **univariate** clog-log model]{.underline} 32 [that **ignores the
endogeneity**]{.underline}, shown in column (1) in Table 1,
[successfully replicates the standard]{.underline}, dyadic [**democratic
peace** finding]{.underline} that democracies are peaceful, though only
toward other democracies. Note that, while individual democracy measures
have either a positive or insignificant coefficient, joint democracy has
a negative coefficient that overwhelms the positive coefficients of
individual democracy measures in the univariate model. As a result, the
univariate model produces a result that, while democracy may increase
conflict against a non-democracy, it decreases conflict against a
democracy.

To illustrate this, we calculate the average treatment effect of joint
democracy for the challenger and for the target based on the univariate
model. These effects are calculated by comparing the predicted
probabilities of conflict initiation when changing the regime type of
self (challenger or target) from non-democracy to democracy, holding
constant the regime type of the other (target or challenger) as
democracy. 33 Gray, hollow circles in Figure 4 show the treatment
effects of challenger's and target's democracy. We can see that both
effects are negative and statistically significant at the 95% confidence
level.

[Once we **correct** the endogeneity, **however**, the data **no longer
support** such conclusions]{.underline}. In column (2) in Table 1, [the
negative coefficient for joint democracy **no longer overwhelms** the
positive coefficient of challenger's democracy. Challenger's democracy
now appears to **increase conflict** even against a **democratic**
target]{.underline}. Red, solid circles in Figure 4 show the average
treatment effects of challenger's and target's democracy, calculated
from the trivariate model. [The effect is **positive** and
**statistically significant** for challenger's democracy]{.underline},
although the effect is indistinguishable from zero for target's
democracy.

[Whether we **correct for endogeneity**]{.underline} thus [makes a
**significant difference** in our estimates of the effect of joint
democracy on conflict]{.underline}. The key to understanding why these
changes occur lies in the estimated correlations between the error terms
for different equations. The estimated error correlation between
equations for conflict and challenger's democracy, 12, is negative and
statistically significant. This suggests that unobservable or
[unmeasured determinants of]{.underline} a country's [democracy make it
less likely for that country to attack another country. A failure to
control for]{.underline} such [factors]{.underline} would [generate a
**negative omitted variable bias**, making it **look** as
if]{.underline} challenger's [democracy has a **pacify**ing effect on
conflict behavior]{.underline}. On the other hand, the estimated error
correlation between conflict and target's democracy equations, 13, is
indistinguishable from zero, suggesting that the endogeneity problem
does not seem to operate for target's regime type.

#### It\'s an [empirical]{.underline} question, [answered]{.underline} by statistical methods\-\--failing to code based on [exogenous]{.underline} variables [corrupts]{.underline} their evidence

https://dainachiba.github.io/research/make2dem/Make2Dem.pdf

Before we review our approach in detail, it may be useful to explain why
[this type of analysis has **not** been pursued **successfully** in the
past]{.underline} and [what makes our effort **different** from
other]{.underline}, broadly related [projects. We are not the first to
apply an IV framework]{.underline} (more specifically) [or
multi-equation models]{.underline} (more broadly) [to the democratic
peace. However, **previous attempts** suffer from two **major
problems**. First, previous studies have typically used a
**dyad**]{.underline} (country pair) [as the **unit**]{.underline} of
observation in analyzing conflict, [which requires]{.underline} some
**[summary measure(s)]{.underline}** of democracy [for a
pair]{.underline} of countries [rather than the]{.underline} state-level
[**(monadic)** democracy measure]{.underline}. 6 [Use of a dyadic
aggregate to represent regime type creates a **discrepancy** between the
**first stage regression** (predicting democracy at the country level)
and the **outcome stage regression** (predicting conflict at the dyad
level).]{.underline} 7 [We **avoid this** problem by using the
**directed dyad** as the **unit** of observation in predicting conflict,
**distinguishing** between the potential challenger and target in a
dispute. This allows us to connect the first stage
equations]{.underline} (predicting the challenger's and target's regime
types) [and the outcome stage equation **seamlessly**]{.underline}.
Doing so has several benefits: the outcome stage model could directly
include country-level covariates (such as challenger's and target's
democracy) without having to convert them to a dyadic summary.
[This]{.underline} also [allows us to estimate the system of equations
jointly rather than relying on the **"forbidden
regression."**]{.underline} 8

[Second, a more daunting challenge]{.underline} in applying an IV
approach to democratic peace research [is the difficulty of finding a
**plausible instrument** for **regime type**]{.underline} [--- a
variable that is **strongly correlated** with **regime type** but is
**unrelated to war**. This is the challenge that has **plagued**
empirical researchers in many fields. For example, a recent
study]{.underline} of the effect of regime type on economic growth [uses
a **diffusion-based** measure]{.underline} of democracy (i.e., average
value of democracies in a given region) as an instrument for democracy
(Acemoglu et al. 2019). [However]{.underline}, diffusion-based
[instruments]{.underline} such as this [are unlikely to be]{.underline}
a **[valid]{.underline}** instrument, [due to **spatial spill-over**,
**interdependence**, and]{.underline}, most importantly,
**[simultaneity]{.underline}** (Betz, Cook, and Hollenbach 2018).
Recognizing problems with spatial instruments, McDonald (2015) seeks to
exploit the very discrepancy between country-level and dyad-level
designs as the source of identification. His discussion, however, lacks
a clear explanation as to why some determinants of regime type do not
influence conflict. 9

[We turn to a **demographic** variable]{.underline} --- average female
**[fertility rate]{.underline}** in a given country --- [as a source of
**variation in regime type** that is **exogenous** to international
conflict]{.underline}. As we will argue below, [a lower fertility rate
is a **strong driver** of democratization]{.underline}. We will
[also]{.underline} present theoretical arguments and a series of
falsification tests that support the claim that average national
**[fertility]{.underline}** rate [does **not**]{.underline} directly
[influence international **conflict**]{.underline}.

DANGERS OF TRANSITION

[The idea that democracies never fight wars]{.underline} against each
other [has become an axiom]{.underline} for many scholars. It is, as one
scholar puts it, "as close as anything we have to an empirical law in
international relations." This "law" is invoked by American statesmen
[to justify]{.underline} a foreign policy that encourages
[democratization abroad]{.underline}. In his 1994 State of the Union
address, President Clinton asserted that no two democracies had ever
gone to war with each other, thus explaining why promoting democracy
abroad was a pillar of his foreign policy.

It is probably true that a world in which more countries were mature,
stable democracies would be safer and preferable for the United States.
[**But** countries do **not** become mature democracies **overnight**.
They usually go through a **rocky transition**, where mass politics
mixes with authoritarian elite politics in a volatile way. **Statistical
ev**idence covering the past two centuries shows that in **this
transitional phase** of democratization, countries become **more
aggressive and war-prone, not less**, and they do **fight wars** with
democratic states. In fact, formerly authoritarian states where
democratic participation is on the rise are **more likely** to fight
wars than are stable democracies or **autocracies**. States that make
the biggest leap]{.underline}, from total autocracy to extensive mass
democracy---like contemporary Russia---[are]{.underline} about [**twice
as likely** to fight wars]{.underline} in the decade [after
democratization as are states that remain **autocracies**]{.underline}.

[This **historical pattern** of **democratization**, **belligerent
nationalism**, and **war** is]{.underline} already
[emerging]{.underline} in some of today's new or partial democracies,
especially some formerly communist states. Two pairs of states---Serbia
and Croatia, and Armenia and Azerbaijan---have found themselves at war
while experimenting with varying degrees of electoral democracy. The
electorate of Russia's partial democracy cast nearly a quarter of its
votes for the party of radical nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Even
mainstream Russian politicians have adopted an imperial tone in their
dealings with neighboring former Soviet republics, and military force
has been used ruthlessly in Chechnya.

The following evidence should raise questions about the Clinton
administration's policy of promoting peace by promoting democratization.
[The expectation that the spread of democracy will probably contribute
to peace in the **long run**]{.underline}, once new democracies mature,
[provides **little comfort** to those who might face a heightened risk
of war in the **short run**. Pushing **nuclear-armed** great powers like
Russia or China **to**ward democratization is like **spinning a roulette
wheel**: many of the outcomes are undesirable]{.underline}. Of course,
in most cases the initial steps on the road to democratization will not
be produced by any conscious policy of the United States. The roulette
wheel is already spinning for Russia and perhaps will be soon for China.
Washington and the international community need to think not so much
about encouraging or discouraging democratization as about helping to
smooth the transition in ways that minimize its risks.

PUBLIC INTEREST STATEMENT

The debate on the suitability of liberal democracy in supporting
economic development in post-colonial African states has unabatedly
continued to remain at the centre of current intellectual discourses and
conversations. Although scholars seem to be focused on the endogenous
constraints to the capacity of liberal democracy in generating the
expected development outcome, specific attention is yet to be paid on
how **[exorbitant spending on elections undermines human development in
Nigeria]{.underline}**. This study therefore argues that [the
**electoral** timetable]{.underline} of a 4-year tenure system renewable
only once, which [sustains **exorbitant** public
expenditure]{.underline} on elections [is **antithetical** to the
**human development** drive of the Nigerian state. It **diverts public
spending**, **incapacitates** the state from addressing the **economic
priority needs** of the people, and **deepens the gap** between the rich
and poor]{.underline}. Redesigning and retuning the content of liberal
democracy in line with the demands, peculiarities and realities of the
Nigerian state are highly recommended in the study.

The Real Cost of Democracy

Aside from the aforementioned financial cost of elections and patronage,
[other expenditures bring the recurring cost of]{.underline} the
[Nigeria's]{.underline} 20-year [democratic project into **tens of
billions** of dollars, an expense that will sooner or later]{.underline}
~~cripple~~ [**\[ruin\] the country** financially]{.underline}. Let me
expatiate. A recent report confirmed what many Nigerians have long
suspected about the remunerations of their elected executive and
legislative leaders: Nigerian [elected]{.underline} public [office
holders]{.underline} at all levels of government [are the highest paid
in the world]{.underline}.\[5\] Together with their string of assistants
and advisors (who sometimes have their own paid advisors), Nigeria's
[public officers gobble up]{.underline} at least [half of the nation's
revenue]{.underline} and budgetary appropriations in legitimate rewards.

[This prohibitive **democratic overhead** has left the country with a
**smaller pool of funds** than ever to **invest** in the things that
matter to Nigerians: roads, healthcare, schools, water, electricity, and
food production. This odd reality of low returns on democratic
investment is **unsustainable**. Something has to give]{.underline}.

[What is being eroded is the **very stability of the state**, along with
**any trust** that citizens still have in it. This is a proverbial
**ticking time bomb** that will implode or **explode** if the trend
continues, **if this democracy endures**]{.underline}. Twenty years
since the return of civilian rule, it is not an exaggeration to say that
not only has [democracy]{.underline} not paid off for Nigeria but that
it [is now a **threat** to its **stability** and
**survival**]{.underline}. This is a radical shift that has occurred
stealthily and has thus been missed by the Western governmental and
non-governmental actors that encouraged and funded democratic advocacy
in the 1990s.

#### The [two-party]{.underline} system creates [polarization]{.underline}, [social violence]{.underline}, and [instability]{.underline}

Political Science at the University of Nigeria, PhD in Political Science

Sciences, Volume 7, Issue 1, 4/28/2021, Taylor & Francis Online

[The **hitches**]{.underline} and abnormalities [characterising
Nigeria's electoral democracy are]{.underline}, no doubt, [intrinsically
linked to the institutionalised two-tenure renewable
system]{.underline}. This tenure system was externally supported by the
purveyors of liberal democracy and domesticated by the local accomplices
solely for self-interest. [In Nigeria, the **winner-takes-all
mentality** as well as the **high stakes** usually associated with
political offices **heightens electoral contestations** among the
competing, **polarised** and distrusted **ethnic nationalities** who
perceive political power as a means of advancing their peculiar economic
interests]{.underline}. The struggle is usually intensified when it is
obvious that access to state power guarantees an unfettered gateway to
huge petro-dollar revenue. Indeed, [the incumbent's penchant for
re-**election** often reinforces the tendency for **divisiveness**,
**violence**, rancour and **instability**]{.underline}. For instance,
the re-election bid of the then President Goodluck Jonathan in 2015
accounted for the deaths of 106 people while the election-related
conflict in 2011 led to the deaths of 800 people and the displacement of
65,000 (Birch & Muchlinski, 2018; Harwood, 2019). The two-tenure system
affects governance and policy responses since incumbent officials
seeking re-election often devote a substantial part of their time and
energy in politicking and grandstanding for a favourable outcome. This
manifested in the 2015 and 2019 re-elections of Goodluck Jonathan and
Muhammadu Buhari, respectively, in Nigeria when both leaders abandoned
their jobs for campaigns. Also, given the monetised and winner-takes-all
approach of Nigerian politics, [incumbent candidates **ruthlessly divert
public funds** for re-election campaigns. It **drains the national
treasury** and **redirects public expenditure** to campaign funding
rather than to **human and capital development**]{.underline}. A classic
example is the ongoing investigation into the Office of the National
Security Adviser which, at the interim, has revealed that the sum of 2.1
USD billion appropriated for procurement of military equipments was
diverted and used to prosecute the 2015 general elections for the
Peoples Democratic Party.

[Liberal democracy's]{.underline} capstone ritual, [**zero-sum**
elections, endow winners with **all the rewards** of
victory]{.underline}---millions of dollars in licit and illicit
earnings, local and international political visibility, and power. [The
loser]{.underline}, conversely, [gets **nothing**. The result is a
**high-stakes version of**]{.underline} what is called
**[FOMO]{.underline}**, or the fear of missing out, in American popular
lingo. [This fear of political exclusion in turn catalyzes
**desperation**, which consistently and predictably
produces]{.underline} messy, **[violent]{.underline}**, and compromised
**[elections]{.underline}**.

In addition, since its return to civilian rule in 1999, [liberal
democracy has been]{.underline} an [unacceptably costly]{.underline}
enterprise for Nigeria. In 2019, [the country spent]{.underline} about
[\$670 million on a]{.underline} general **[election]{.underline}**
widely condemned as a sham. With budget financing increasingly steeped
in external and internal debt, and [given the **fungibility** of state
funds]{.underline}, there is a depressing possibility that Nigeria is
borrowing to fund elections and to finance its fledgling democratic
institutions and processes. [It's a hefty price tag in a country where

fortune to maintain a large army of elected and appointed civilian
officials, the unsustainability of this "democratic" trajectory emerges
in full relief.

The end of the Cold War might have represented the end of mutually
assured destruction ([MAD]{.underline}), but it [did not]{.underline}
necessarily [dispel the dangers of the nuclear age]{.underline} -- in
fact, to some extent the globalised [proliferation of non-conventional
weapons has instead escalated the possibilities for a nuclear attack
being carried out]{.underline}. During the Cold War, the belligerents of
any nuclear conflict would have been easily identifiable; however, in
the post-Cold-War era, non-state actors and [**terrorist** groups like
**Boko Haram** have emerged as potential players in]{.underline} a new
variety of **[nuclear conflicts]{.underline}** that would entirely be
based on terrorist models. The ominous possibilities for this new kind
of warfare are indeed terrifying, and [the rise in terrorist
attacks]{.underline} around the globe [enhances the likelihood of such
an occurrence]{.underline}. Since 9/11, the body of academic literature
on the threat posed by terrorists regarding weapons of mass destruction
(WMDs) and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) devices
has increased. In Gary Ackerman and Jeremy Tamsett's edited volume,
Jihadists and Weapons of Mass Destruction, there is disagreement as to
whether this threat is overestimated or underestimated.1 In recent
times, however, [ample ideological incentive for the use of **CBRN**
devices has been provided]{.underline} by the likes of Abu Mus'ab
al-Suri -- author of the 'Global Islamic Resistance Call' -- who has
stated that '\[t\]he aim of carrying out resistance missions and
individual jihad terrorism "jihad al-irhabi al-fardi" is to inflict the
largest human and material casualties possible on American interests and
its allied countries'.2 This echoes the previous call of Grand Ayatollah
Ahmad Husayni al-Baghdadi, who maintained:

> If the objective and subjective conditions materialize, and there are
> soldiers, weapons, and money -- even if this means using biological,
> chemical, and bacterial weapons -- we will conquer the world, so that
> 'There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is His Prophet' will be
> triumphant over the domes of Moscow, Washington, and Paris.3

For Boko Haram and other groups, there definitely exists a strong
motivation for the use of WMDs, and the global reach of this thinking is
not in doubt:

> The globalization of the jihadist struggle has also led to an
> increased emphasis on Islamic identity. In combination with the
> ideological theme of revenge, the global struggle for Islamic identity
> has the potential to create a new jihadist cultic worldview in which
> its endorsers seek out WMDs because they represent the only means to
> significantly transform reality.4

Contextual scenarios in Nigeria strongly suggest that Boko Haram is one
such group which has embraced the jihadist world view that endorses the
use of WMDs. In this regard, the strengthened affiliation of Boko
Haram's splinter group -- the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP)
-- with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) confirms their
ideological persuasions. The motivation for Boko Haram to use such
weapons is thus grounded in the recent use of chemical weapons by ISIS
in both Iraq and Syria against both military and civilian targets.5 If
ISIS is claiming ownership of a faction of Boko Haram as its West
African province, it is likely to extend its tactics to its African
allies.

In the light of the above, the use of WMDs by terrorists cannot be
explained within the framework of orthodox terrorism theories. With this
in mind, what Russell Worth Parker refers to as the 'Islamic just war
theory' suitably anchors a discourse on terrorism and advanced weapons
of war.6 Most theorists do not support a subjective theory of 'just
war', but rather the traditional version that relies on Western ideas of
morality and proportionality, as well as on motives for waging war.7 On
the other hand, jihadist traditions reinterpret just war's key tenet of
proportionality to suit Islamists' conflict rationale. According to the
Western form of just war theory, wherein discrimination proves
strategically impossible, any response should be proportionate to the
action that compels it -- hence, proportionality dictates that a
military operation should not cause greater harm than the act that it
was designed to counter or prevent.8 This proportionality argument is
exemplified in the use of nuclear weapons in the Second World War; since
casualty estimates for an invasion of Japan exceeded one million Allied
lives, with similar estimates for Japanese military and civilians, a
nuclear attack was preferable. Eventually, the actual casualties
suffered from the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki reached 200,000,
which represents 10% of the casualties that would likely have been
incurred if Japan had been invaded (see https://avalon.law.yale.edu/).
In the light of this argument, justification for the use of WMDs by
terrorist groups would rest on their interpretation of the extent of the
damage caused by the military aggression and long-term imperialism of
Western powers.

Fighting faceless enemies in a CBRN conflict, whether in West Africa or
the Middle East, is hard to imagine. Enemies who can easily blend into
the crowd and take on the face of ordinary civilians represent a
nightmare scenario for security strategists all around the world. The
risk of WMDs falling into the hands of terrorist groups is largely
dependent on their ability to obtain weapons-grade nuclear material like
uranium and plutonium, combined with gaining the capability to build and
deploy weapons which make use of them. The global proliferation of
nuclear material has made this possible today.

Global proliferation of fissile material

The collapse of the Soviet military-industrial complex ushered in a
period of uncertainty regarding the security of nuclear material.
Consequently, the risk of fissile material falling into the hands of
terrorist groups -- or into the hands of states that sympathise with or
harbour such groups -- increased considerably. Lax security at former
Soviet nuclear facilities was widespread, making the theft of nuclear
material possible. In the chaos that followed the Soviet collapse in the
early 1990s, radioactive material was frequently stolen from poorly
guarded reactors and nuclear facilities in Russia and its former
satellite states. Police operations have intercepted shipments of Soviet
nuclear material in cities as far away as Munich and Prague, and experts
believe that large batches are still unaccounted for and most likely
accessible to well-connected traders on the black market.9

Over 1800 metric tons of nuclear material is still stored in facilities
belonging to more than 25 countries all around the world.10 Not all of
this material is located in military stockpiles -- in fact, most
countries maintain civil stockpiles of plutonium for use in nuclear
power reactors. The civil stockpiles in the United Kingdom (UK), India,
Belgium, France, Germany, Japan and Russia add up to over 230 metric
tons of plutonium. In spite of these enormous quantities, the UK, India,
France, Japan and Russia have not yet reduced the reprocessing of
plutonium for civil use. Although civil plutonium is not weapons-grade,
it remains viable as a raw material that can be transformed through an
enrichment process for use in a bomb. The United States (US) on the
other hand has a comparatively small amount of civil plutonium because
of its 1970 policy to suspend the separation of plutonium from spent
nuclear fuel.11

About 25 kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU) is required to build a bomb
-- an insignificant amount in comparison to the global stockpile, which
is in excess of 1.6 million kg. On the other hand, about 8 kg of
plutonium is needed to build a bomb -- a tiny fraction of the 500,000 kg
global stockpile.12 Nuclear facilities that are relics of the Cold War
era, especially those located in Eastern Europe, represent a high
security risk. More than 130 nuclear reactors powered by HEU are
operational in over 40 countries -- the fallout of an early Cold-War-era
programme in which the US and the Soviet Union helped their allies to
obtain nuclear technology. Several other reactors have been shut down
but may still contain nuclear fuel on site. In total, the world's
research reactors contain 22 tons of HEU -- enough to build hundreds of
nuclear bombs. The problem is that research reactor fuel tends to be
stored under notoriously light security, making it a very vulnerable
target for terrorists.13

In 2004, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a
report that details security lapses at civilian nuclear installations,
citing a case in which the fences surrounding an unnamed foreign
research reactor were in very poor condition and there were no guards
securing the reactor building itself. In this report, Harvard expert
Matthew Bunn explains that unlike the bulky and extremely radioactive
fuel rods used in commercial nuclear power plants, research reactor fuel
consists of small pellets that weigh only a few pounds each and moreover
are easier to handle --a simple backpack can conceal several pellets.14
Naturally, civilian stockpiles are at greater risk of theft than those
held in military installations. Consequently, the possibilities of such
dangerous material falling into the hands of terrorists groups have
become increasingly plausible.

Regarding military stockpiles, Russia and the US possess the largest
amounts of weapons-grade plutonium -- 100 and 150 metric tons,
respectively. Diplomatic attempts aimed at reducing these stockpiles
have resulted in an agreement for the two countries to dispose of 34
metric tons each via the method of turning the weapons-grade plutonium
into fuel for nuclear power reactors. Although this agreement has not
been effected yet, it is obvious given the above that the process may
expose the material to greater risk of theft rather than securing it.15
On the other hand, in 2005 the US Congress eliminated the long-standing
restrictions that were placed on the exporting of HEU to other countries
for the purpose of manufacturing medical isotopes, which has also
created new avenues for the proliferation of nuclear material through
civilian use.16

Although the civilian use of nuclear material has increased the risk of
its proliferation, the military facilities currently holding nuclear
material around the world -- especially in Russia -- are also not well
secured. Thousands of Cold-War-era tactical weapons are stored at very
poorly guarded military installations, and most of these weapons are
small and do not have electronic locks that prevent unauthorised
usage.17 Since the collapse of the Soviet Union there has been no viable
security strategy for securing the nuclear material contained in many of
the former empire's cities. During the Cold War era, the citizens of
these cities had access to these facilities -- and they still do, a
problem further compounded by the fact that a strict inventory of the
nuclear material contained in these facilities is not maintained.18

The likes of infamous arms dealer Leonid Minin (who was found guilty in
a court of law for supplying weapons to non-state actors in African
conflicts) are all too willing to do business with terrorists.19, 20
Arms dealers and smugglers all over the world are always seeking
lucrative opportunities, and it is almost certain that some nuclear
material has already been acquired by dangerous fanatics.

Several incidents in recent decades give every reason to believe that
this is the case. In 1993, Kazakhstani authorities discovered HEU
capable of arming 20 bombs in a building that was poorly secured.21 In
2006, Russian citizen Oleg Khinsagov was arrested in Georgia for
carrying 100 g of HEU and attempting to find a buyer for what he claimed
was many additional kilograms.22 In 2011, six men with 4 g of uranium
were arrested by security forces in Moldova. Upon questioning, they
claimed that the 4 g represented a sample of the product they were ready
to market. They claimed to possess an additional 9kg, which represents
one third of the quantity needed to create a nuclear weapon. The leader
of this group and the North African buyer escaped.23 Four years before
this incident, gunmen raided a facility in Pelindaba, South Africa; the
details of the event are still shrouded in mystery.24

[Efforts by **terrorist** organisation**s** to **purchase and use
nuclear weapons** continue unabated]{.underline}. The most high profile
of these known efforts is that of Osama bin Laden, who in 2001 attempted
to purchase a canister of uranium in Sudan for US\$1.5 million.
Intelligence reports claim that he also met with two Pakistani nuclear
scientists, and [sketches of nuclear weapons were found at an
**al-Qaeda** training camp.25]{.underline}

From the foregoing, it is clear that there exists a robust and thriving
black market in fissile material that seems to be tailor-made for use by
terrorists groups. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as at
December 2015 had recorded in its trafficking database a total of 2889
incidents involving losses, thefts and/or attempts to traffic fissile
material across international borders.26 This is an incredibly high rate
of security lapses considering the security priority that nuclear
facilities are supposed to possess. More pressing is the fact that the
agency does not inspect every nuclear facility globally, and as such is
not in a position to comprehensively enforce strict security and safety
regulations. As a consequence of this, fissile material often goes
missing and subsequently appears on the black market without being
reported to the agency. Furthermore, several nations which maintain
nuclear facilities do not possess the requisite resources to subject
employees to the kind of extensive background checks that can ensure
their trustworthiness for working at such high-security sites. In the
absence of this screening, the likelihood of people with terrorist ties
applying for jobs at nuclear facilities for the purpose of obtaining
nuclear material is very high.

There is mounting evidence worldwide that increasing amounts of fissile
material are being stolen and traded. Although the Russian government
refuses to admit that it has lost any nuclear weapons, at least four
Russian nuclear submarines have sunk, and it is believed that the
warheads on board are yet to be recovered. The US on the other hand has
admitted to losing a staggering 11 nuclear weapons.27

How can Boko Haram obtain nuclear material?

Boko Haram is one of the deadliest terrorist groups in the world. Since
2009, it has engaged with the Nigerian state in a lethal terrorism
campaign aimed at toppling the secular structure and replacing it with
an Islamist state. By May 2014 over 12,000 Nigerians had been killed in
the insurgency,28 while one in five persons from Borno, Yobe and Adamawa
states had been internally displaced. According to the 2017 Global
Terrorism Index, Boko Haram ranks as the second deadliest terrorist
group in the world, with an all-time high death toll of over 6000 in
2014 alone.29

[With known ties to al-Qaeda, Boko Haram has an estimated annual income
in excess of US\$25 million]{.underline}.30 By 2017, Boko Haram had been
forced to retreat from the large areas it had previously occupied in the
north-east of Nigeria, driven back by the joint international military
efforts of several countries in West and Central Africa. This created
the need for them to reassert themselves. The likelihood of this group
re-strategising and reconsolidating is high. Consequently, their
[acquisition of]{.underline} fissile material for the development and
deployment of radiological '[dirty bombs']{.underline} has
[increased]{.underline} in probability. The [availability of this
material]{.underline} on the continent and [within]{.underline} Nigeria
itself [presents **ominous opportunities**]{.underline} for the group.
Apart from large deposits of uranium ore found [in Africa]{.underline},
several countries including South Africa, Morocco, Libya, Ghana, Egypt,
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Nigeria itself presently
possess nuclear research reactors.31

The IAEA has reported no less than 12 incidents of natural uranium
smuggling between 1995 and 2005 in Africa alone. In fact, illegal
uranium mining at the Shinkolobwe mine in Katanga, DRC is presently a
source of great concern. More importantly, this is where the source
material for the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs was obtained.32 The
proliferation of fissile material across the continent heightens the
possibility of non-state actors like Boko Haram gaining access to it.
Although there has only been one recorded theft of eight uranium fuel
rods from a Kinshasa research reactor in 1997, the disturbing fact about
this is that seven of the rods were never recovered.33

Within Nigeria itself, opportunities abound for terrorist groups like
Boko Haram and other militant organisations to obtain fissile material
for use in nuclear devices or dirty bombs. In 2004, Nigeria commissioned
a 30-kW miniature neutron source reactor (NIRR-1) for the purpose of
nuclear energy research.34 This nuclear facility is located at the
Centre for Energy Research and Training at Ahmadu Bello University Zaria
in the north of the country, where terrorist activities and Islamist
extremism have been going on for centuries. The possibility of Islamist
extremists infiltrating nuclear facilities and smuggling out fissile
material has been an ongoing security concern for a number of years. An
outright attack on a lightly secured facility is a second possibility
that actually played out in 2007, when a nuclear research facility in
Pelindaba, South Africa was raided by armed assailants, who breached its
security perimeter and gained entry.35 Another concern is unsecured
radioactive waste -- namely 234 legacy sources presently located at the
Ajaokuta Steel Company in Kogi State -- that has not been disposed of
and could easily be obtained by Boko Haram.36 To complicate matters
further, the construction of a low to medium radioactive waste
management facility at Nigeria's Nuclear Technology Centre has been
abandoned.37

Can Boko Haram build and use non-conventional weapons?

The poor state of nuclear security combined with the tenacity of Boko
Haram makes Nigeria a prime location for the advent of nuclear
terrorism. Knowhow on building a nuclear device is widely available, as
is the key component, HEU, which can be found all over the world in
dozens of military and civilian nuclear facilities -- like the one at
Ahmadu Bello University. Once Boko Haram has obtained enough HEU, a
choice can be made between two types of nuclear device. The first is the
gun-type mechanism, in which the HEU is smashed together to produce an
explosion. The second type, which is more advanced, requires a chamber
in which the HEU is compressed in a highly symmetrical manner in order
to create an implosion. The gun-type mechanism is the more likely option
for terrorist groups because it is simpler.38

In order to use the gun-type mechanism to activate a nuclear device,
Boko Haram operatives would need to assemble a crude cannon that can
smash HEU together -- and the more highly enriched the uranium, the less
advanced the weaponry that is needed. The viability of any terrorist
group accomplishing such a task has been tested by US senator Joe Biden.
In 2004 he asked scientists at three national laboratories to see if
they could assemble the mechanical components of a gun-type bomb with
commercially available equipment alone. A few months later, they
reported back that they had succeeded.39 With over US\$25 million in
annual income, Boko Haram has the resources to obtain both the
scientific knowhow and the materials needed to build and deploy a
gun-type nuclear weapon.

Radiological dirty bombs

The threat of non-conventional weapons proliferation and terrorism goes
beyond nuclear weapons -- it also encompasses radiological dirty bombs.
The raw materials used to create nuclear weapons are very dangerous;
they contain highly radioactive substances that would pose a serious
health hazard if dispersed in human populations using a detonation
device. Plutonium and uranium could thus be weaponised in the form of a
radiological dirty bomb, also known as a radiological dispersal device
(RDD), which would cause widespread fatalities and cost billions of
dollars in clean-up, evacuation and relocation operations.40

Terrorist groups like Boko Haram could easily build and use an RDD,
given the widespread proliferation of fissile material -- and more
importantly given the dual-use materials that can produce the same
radiological effects as fissile material from nuclear installations.
Radiological dual-use materials from smoke alarms and medical services
are among the most easily accessible; highly radioactive isotopes are in
fact used in life-saving blood transfusions and cancer treatments in
hospitals all around the world, including several in Nigeria. These
isotopes include cesium-137, cobalt-60 and iridium-192, which can easily
be used as base materials for a bomb or an RDD.41 The challenge is that
most of the medical, commercial and industrial groups that handle these
materials are not adequately equipped to provide the security needed to
prevent them from being stolen. On the other hand, the lack of
regulatory controls in many countries has led to thousands of instances
of missing or stolen radiological material that cannot be accounted for.
Recently, the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies found in
an alarming study that 170 incidents where nuclear or radiological
material was lost, stolen or outside regulatory control occurred in 2014
alone.42

RDDs are viable weapons for terrorist groups like Boko Haram to pursue
-- and terrorist states have also attempted to obtain them. On 28 March
2002, Abu Zubaydah -- a key al-Qaeda operative -- was captured in
Pakistan. He is widely believed to have told US investigators that
al-Qaeda was 'interested' in building or obtaining a dirty bomb. Further
evidence emerged on 8 May 2002, when Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) agents arrested Abdullah al Muhajir on charges of planning a
radiological attack in the US at the direction of al-Qaeda operatives.

States that sponsor and support terrorist groups are likely to pass on
fissile and radiological material to them. Iraq under Saddam Hussein is
known to have sought radiological material for this purpose. In 1987,
Iraq tested a bomb weighing 1400 kg that carried radioactive particles
derived from irradiated impurities in zirconium oxide. A further 100
prototypes were designed from the casings of Muthanna-3 aerial chemical
bombs, which were then modified to a 400-kg weight so that aircraft
could carry more of them. It is likely that only 25 of these prototypes
were destroyed, and that the other 75 were sent to the Al Qa Qaa State
Establishment, a massive Iraqi weapons facility; their current status
and whereabouts remain unknown.43

Chemical and biological weapons

The most commonly used non-conventional weapons are chemical or
biological in nature. The long history of chemical and biological
weapons usage dates as far back as 600 BC when, during a siege, Solon of
Athens poisoned the drinking water of the city of Kirrha.44 More
recently -- starting with the use of mustard gas during the First World
War -- nations have acquired chemical and biological weapons easily,
deploying them against enemies and their own citizens alike. For
terrorist groups like Boko Haram, chemical and biological weapons are
uniquely suited to their agenda and as such present very attractive
alternatives to nuclear; they are extremely difficult to detect, cost
effective and easy to deploy. Aerosols of biological agents are
invisible to the naked eye, silent, odourless, tasteless and relatively
easily dispersed. Most importantly they are 600 to 2000 times cheaper
than other WMDs. Recent estimates place the cost of biological weapons
at about 0.05% of the cost of a conventional weapon which could produce
similar numbers of mass casualties per square kilometre.45

The proliferation of chemical and biological weapons has proved to be
very fluid over the past century due to advancements in technology.
Production is comparatively easy via the commonplace technology that is
used in the manufacturing of antibiotics, vaccines, foods and beverages,
while delivery systems such as spray devices deployed from airplane,
boat or car are widely available. Another advantage of biological agents
is the natural lead time provided by the organism's incubation period
(three to seven days in most cases), allowing the terrorists to deploy
the agent and then escape before an investigation by law enforcement and
intelligence agencies can even begin. Furthermore, not only would the
use of an endemic infectious agent likely cause initial confusion
because of the difficulty of differentiating between a biological
warfare attack and a natural epidemic, but with some agents the
potential also exists for secondary or tertiary transmission from person
to person or via natural vectors.46

Unlike their nuclear and radiological counterparts, biological and
chemical weapons have been used for terrorism by both state and
non-state actors. The challenges faced in preventing the use of these
weapons through international control mechanisms include the increasing
availability of larger quantities of substances, ease of use and most
especially advanced technological deployment facilities that portend a
high risk factor to larger populations. Table 1 catalogues the use of
biochemical weapons in warfare and by terrorists and other groups or
individuals over the past century, offering concrete historical
precedent and empirical grounds for the potential future actions of Boko
Haram. The data shows consistent recourse to the use of these weapons,
in spite of the chemical and biological weapons conventions outlawing
them. It can be seen that from the 1970s onwards there has been an
increase in the use of biochemical weapons by religious cults and
terrorist groups in pursuit of their agendas. The rise of Boko Haram and
its ISIS affiliation could lead to a future where the use of biochemical
weapons is the norm rather than the exception.

As stated previously, the contextual scenarios in Nigeria that validate
this prognosis regarding Boko Haram's possible actions are strongly
supported by their ideological persuasions. The fact that Boko Haram
embraces a jihadist world view which endorses the use of WMDs is
strengthened not only by its affiliation to ISIS through ISWAP but also
by the similarities in its strategic modus operandi. Like ISIS, Boko
Haram both believes in the slaughter of other Muslims who are deemed to
be in cahoots with infidels, and advocates for the destruction of
civilian populations -- whether Muslim or otherwise -- that are regarded
as obstructing the advancement or creation of their caliphate.47 This
was practically demonstrated by ISIS in Syria and Iraq when they used
chemical weapons against both civilian and military populations, as
shown in Table 1.48

Nigeria's counterterrorism strategy

The central control measure for preventing nuclear terrorism is to
ensure at the international level that nuclear material does not fall
into the hands of terrorist groups like Boko Haram and other non-state
actors in the first place. This is very difficult to achieve, given the
lax security measures found at nuclear installations all over the world.
Recognising the danger, the US under the Obama administration committed
in 2010 at a nuclear security summit in Washington DC to securing all
nuclear material within four years in an effort to prevent nuclear
terrorism.49 Nigeria was a participant of this summit and is also
committed to implementing the agreements that were reached. These
attempts by the Obama administration followed up on the efforts embedded
in the landmark 1987 Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear
Material (CPPNM), which was meant to prevent nuclear material from being
obtained by terrorists. The provisions of this convention were amended
in 2005, and by 2010 the Washington summit had created the needed sense
of urgency regarding the security of fissile material.50 Negotiations
around the CPPNM started in 1979,51 and over the decades the growing
proliferation of fissile material has combined with the increase in
global terrorism to raise the profile of the issue of fissile material
security. As of 2016, a total of 93 states including Nigeria had
ratified the CPPNM, resulting in tighter security around the world at
nuclear installations and border controls.

Nigeria has been engaged for decades in international efforts to control
nuclear proliferation and terrorism. The country has ratified and
acceded to over a dozen international instruments since 1963, including
the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board
Aircraft (1963), the CPPNM (1987), the Amendment to the CPPNM (2006) and
the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear
Terrorism (2007).52 At the level of global collective security, Nigeria
is involved in implementing the United Nations (UN) Global
Counter-Terrorism Strategy, which was adopted unanimously by the General
Assembly in Resolution 60/288.53 At the regional and subregional levels,
the counterterrorism strategies of the African Union (AU) and the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have been ratified
and are in the process of being implemented. In pursuance of effecting
these various international agreements, Nigeria has also instituted
their National Counterterrorism Strategy (NACTEST), which was revised in
2016. Presently the country is also working with the UN
Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF) on projects designed
to build community resilience against terrorism, enhance cooperation
among law enforcement agencies and strengthen judicial institutions.54

[**The CBRN terrorism threat** in **Nigeria** is both **real and

activities in the world]{.underline}; in fact, according to the 2016
Global Terrorism Index, [Nigeria ranked third among 163
countries]{.underline}, with a terrorism death rate of 16.8% of the
global total.55 Although attacks declined in 2017, [Nigeria still
retained third place on the Global Terrorism Index]{.underline}.56
Recently, Boko Haram has initiated a comeback that has seen renewed
attacks and the abduction of more girls from schools in the north-east
of the country. Security forces have continued to engage the group on
the frontlines in their forest bases; with the assistance of local and
international joint task forces, much of the conflict has been shifted
to more remote areas in the north-east. Although the government security
forces have gained the upper hand in their frontal clashes with Boko
Haram forces, by January 2018 the group had successfully carried out
several brutal assaults, including one on UN and Doctors Without Borders
staff, shifting their strategy back to traditional hit-and-run guerrilla
tactics. During Easter of the same year, a single attack utilising 5
suicide bombers resulted in over 29 dead and 84 wounded.57

The likelihood that Boko Haram may begin to use CBRN weapons is
increasing, and biological and chemical terrorism is potentially more
difficult to prevent than conventional terrorist attacks. Since the
latter part of the twentieth century, the Internet has contributed to
the spread of chemical and biological weapons knowhow, thereby
increasing the likelihood of Boko Haram being able to obtain not only
the ingredients needed to create biochemical weapons but also the
information needed to build and successfully deploy them. Some of the
base materials for such weapons even occur naturally, like castor beans,
which can be processed to produce the dangerous toxin ricin and deployed
against unsuspecting populations. Furthermore, live strains of very
dangerous viruses like Ebola can be found in high-tech research labs,
like those at the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics and
Infectious Diseases (ACEGID) at the Redeemer's University Ede in Osun
State. If Boko Haram were to secure this virus and weaponise it, the age
of biowarfare would arrive in Nigeria -- with deadly consequences. More
importantly, the materials that are needed to create most chemical
weapons exist in large quantities as dual-use materials that can be
purchased on the open market and ferried into the country via forged
end-user certificates.

The chemical and biological weapons conventions represent control
structures geared towards the containment of these non-conventional
weapons, and to a large extent state signatories like Nigeria have
implemented a good level of the instruments contained in them; however,
some nations still maintain secret stockpiles and have used them in
recent conflicts, like Iraq against Iran and Kurdish dissidents in the
1980s and 1990s, and the Syrian government, which is presently using
them against its civilian population.

On the whole, the counterterrorism measures put in place to deal with
the aftermath of a chemical or biological attack have gained more
credibility in the international community. Although there is no
dedicated international inter-agency mechanism for coordinating the
response to terrorism involving the release of toxic chemicals or
biological agents, there are mechanisms that have evolved in the context
of humanitarian assistance and emergency response after natural
catastrophes, such as earthquakes; these include the Global Outbreak
Alert and Response Network (GOARN), the World Health Organization (WHO),
the Global Early Warning System (GLEWS), the Global Framework for the
Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases (GF-TAD) and the
International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN). The primary
inter-agency mechanism that coordinates responses to emergencies
involving the agencies mentioned above is the UN Disaster Assessment and
Coordination (UNDAC).58 To further strengthen inter-agency coordination
in the wake of a terrorist attack of catastrophic proportions, the UN
CTITF is also focusing on planning for such an eventuality.

At the local level, several key aspects of Nigeria's NACTEST are
presently being utilised. The strategy is divided into five work
streams:

- Forestall: Prevent terrorism in Nigeria by engaging the public through
  sustained enlightenment and sensitisation campaigns and
  deradicalisation programmes.

- Secure: Ensure the protection of life, property and key national
  infrastructure and public services, including Nigerian interests
  around the world.

- Identify: Ensure that all terrorist acts are properly investigated,
  and that terrorists and their sponsors are brought to justice.

- Prepare: Prepare the populace so that the consequences of terrorist
  incidents can be mitigated.

- Implement: Devise a framework to effectively mobilise and sustain a
  coordinated, cross-governmental, population-centred effort.59

Presently, the first three aspects of these work streams are receiving
full attention. However, in regard to WMDs, the counterterrorism
strategy is lacking a well-integrated CBRN protocol for engaging with
the work streams for preparation and implementation. Nigeria currently
handles issues relating to nuclear and radiological matters through two
institutions: the Nigerian Atomic Energy Agency (NAEC) and the Nigerian
Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NNRA). It is therefore expected that,
given the growing CBRN threat level in the country, these agencies will
collaborate with the Office of the Security Adviser to the President in
order to initiate a proper CBRN counterterrorism protocol.

The NACTEST does not currently include a dedicated protocol for handling
CBRN threats; Nigeria is however involved in nuclear security at the
international level, which has primarily provided for capacity-building
and human resources development. Activities in these areas include the
gradual process of converting the miniature neutron source reactor in
Zaria from using HEU to low enriched uranium (LEU), partnerships for
nuclear and radiological security with the US Department of Defence
(DoD) and the IAEA, establishing a nuclear security support centre in
the country, reviewing the 2012 design basis threat (DBT) for protecting
nuclear and radiological material, the development of a programme for
locating and securing orphan legacy radioactive sources, training
security officers, the installation of a radiation portal monitor at the
Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos in 2008 and the
acquisition of three more monitors for other international airports in
the country.60

An integrated CBRN protocol would fall under the preparation and
implementation work streams of the NACTEST. The protocol should include
a strategy for detecting CBRN agents in the wake of terrorist events,
followed by disaster response and countermeasure initiatives to be
carried out by security, medical and disaster response teams. Given the
availability of advanced technology, the integrated CBRN
counterterrorism protocol should also include the deployment of handheld
radiological and biochemical detectors to high-risk areas, and security
forces and disaster response teams should be trained in their usage.
Embedding a standard protocol in the NACTEST on how to prepare for and
respond to CBRN events is essential for repositioning counterterrorist
activities in the country to meet the present threat level. The US and
Canada along with the UK and most other European countries facing CBRN
threats have already repositioned accordingly in order to accommodate
this new reality.

Conclusion

[Any terrorist attack involving WMDs is the **ultimate nightmare
scenario**]{.underline}. Fortunately, at least some of these potential
attacks are preventable. If and when the nuclear security summit
achieves its goals, the possibility of a nuclear terrorist attack in
Nigeria will be immensely reduced. Unfortunately, the likelihood of
radiological, chemical and biological attacks is more difficult to
regress, making it all the more vital to integrate a CBRN protocol into
Nigeria's counterterrorism strategy.

[Preventing such a tragic event]{.underline} from occurring [will
require very close ongoing monitoring]{.underline} of the strategic
manoeuvrings of Boko Haram. From its inception to the present day, the
organisation has depended on the looting of military armouries to source
most of its heavy weapons and equipment. It has built up an impressive
arsenal in this manner and there is no indication that the group will
stop using this highly profitable strategy, which could be further
employed to obtain advanced CBRN weaponry from facilities that are
vulnerable to being raided. The civilian facilities mentioned in this
paper are at high risk of being targeted in this fashion; hence, the
recalibration of Nigeria's CBRN counterterrorism protocols should
include a security framework that provides military security for
facilities like the ACEGID in Osun State and the Centre for Energy
Research and Training at Ahmadu Bello University Zaria. Lastly, although
the IAEA has assisted in the conversion of Nigeria's reactor from HEU to
LEU,61 the availability of fissile material at the facility means that
the risk of radioactive dirty bombs being created from looted material
is still present.

Texas, Austin, Visiting Scholar at Harvard University, Associate

This pessimism stems from the unavoidable transition of capitalism from
its expanding form to a stationary one under severe scarcity of
resources, as "whether we are unable to sustain growth or unable to
tolerate it...,it seems beyond dispute that the present orientation of
society must change" (1980: 110, original emphasis). Social tensions
will inevitably rise when scarcity-propelled stationary or even
slow-growing capitalism renders infeasible the usual method of appeasing
the lower and middle classes by further deepening the grab into the
nature to improve their economic positions, leaving the diminishing of
the incomes of the upper echelons of society the only option (1980:
102). [Given]{.underline} the [widespread belief that "centralized
authority will cope with crisis and unrest more 'successfully' than less
authoritarian structures" and the historic pattern in democracies
where]{.underline} "the [pressure]{.underline} of political movement in
times of war, civil commotion, or general anxiety [pushes *in the
direction of authority*, not away from it]{.underline}," (1980: 128--9,
original emphasis) Heilbroner concluded that [intolerable]{.underline}
socioeconomic [strains will]{.underline} eventually [**exceed** the
**capabilities** of representative democracy, leading governments of
these societies to **resort** to **authoritarian measures**]{.underline}
(1980: 106).

Similarly, Ophuls contended that [under conditions of **ecological
scarcity**, if individuals are allowed to pursue their **self-interest**
"**unrestrained** by a **common authority**," the result is **bound** to
be **"common environmental ruin"**]{.underline} (1977: 151).
Accordingly:

> [the **individualistic** basis of society, the concept of inalienable
> **rights**, the purely **self-defined** pursuit of happiness, liberty
> as **maximum freedom of action**, and **laissez faire itself** all
> become **problematic**, requiring]{.underline} major modification or
> perhaps even [**abandonment** if we wish to avert **inexorable
> environmental degradation** and eventual **extinction as a
> civilization**]{.underline}. (1977: 152)

To him, [the **only solution** is "a sufficient measure of
**coercion**;" and "**democracy** as we know it **cannot conceivably
survive**"]{.underline} (1977: 151--2).

In the same vein, Ophuls and Boyan (1992) talked about the crucial role
that "ecological mandarins" must play under resource scarcity.
Concurring with Robert Dahl'spoint that "a reasonable man will want the
most competent people to have authority over the matters on which they
are most competent" (Dahl, 1970: 58), Ophuls and Boyan emphasized that
"under certain circumstances [democracy *must* give way to **elite
rule**]{.underline}," and "the more closely one's situation resembles a
perilous sea voyage, the stronger the rationale for placing power and
authority in the hands of the few who know how to run the ship" (Ophuls
and Boyan, 1992: 209, original emphasis). Given that ecology is esoteric
and that only those with talents and training are qualified as
specialists, "a class of ecological mandarins who possess the esoteric
knowledge" is required to run the "ecologically complex steady-state
society" well. [Such a society]{.underline}

[The doubt about the ability of democracy to handle climate challenges
is **palpable**]{.underline} from the intellectual Left as well. Eric
Hobsbawm offered a threefold explanation for his pessimism. To begin
with, [many]{.underline} of the [strategies needed to avoid climate
change would be **extremely unpopular** and]{.underline} therefore
[**difficult to implement** in a democracy. As a result, even as "the
**impact**]{.underline} of human action on nature and the globe [has
become a **force**]{.underline} of geological proportions," "[no support
will be found by **counting votes**" for measures **required** for
**mitigating** these problems]{.underline}. Moreover, given that nature
is border-blind, [even if voters of **some** democratic states were
sensible, the political mechanisms available]{.underline} to human kind
in the 21th century [are "effectively **confined within**]{.underline}
the **[borders]{.underline}** of nation-states" [and **"dramatically
ill-suited"** to deal with problems lying **beyond** their range of
operation]{.underline} (2007: 113). Finally, democratic national
governments are not the only relevant organizational entities that can
have an effect on an increasingly globalized and transnational world. "A
growing part of human life now occurs beyond the influence of voters, in
transnational public and private entities that have no electorates, or
at least no democratic ones." Thus, "[\[d\]emocracy]{.underline},
however desirable, [is **not an effective device** for solving
**global** or **transnational** problems]{.underline}"(2007: 118).

This wave of academic literature that questions the compatibility of
democracy with timely and effective climate mitigation resonates with
works dating back to the 1970s that focused on the role of democracy in
environmental conservation. In An Inquiry into the Human Prospect,
Heilbroner set to answer, in a world plagued by problems such as rapid
environmental degradation, "is there hope for man?" Writing in 1974, he
highlighted that:

> [the amount of CO2]{.underline} in the air [is expected to
> **double**]{.underline} by the year 2020... [sufficient to raise
> surface temperatures on earth by]{.underline} some 1.5o to [3.0o ...

> [Florida]{.underline}. Long before that it is feared that the rise in
> temperature would have irreversibly altered rainfall patterns, [with
> **grave potential effects**]{.underline}. (1980 \[1974\]: 72)

With the approaching of the depletion of natural resources, Heilbroner
expressed deep doubt about the ability of the democratic form of
government in ensuring the survival of \[hu\]mankind.

[Climate change's negative impact on humans is hardly something up for
questioning]{.underline}. The World Health Organization believes that
between 2030 and 2050 [the effects of climate change will
be]{.underline} an additional of **[250 000 deaths every
year]{.underline}**; due to diarrhoea, malaria, heat stress and
malnutrition.1 Accordingly, [we can expect **millions** of deaths to
occur, and]{.underline} the [increased frequency of]{.underline} natural
[disasters will push the expected death toll **even
further**]{.underline}. Additionally, [the rising sea levels,
and]{.underline} other [environmental consequences, will cause an
**unprecedented flow** of **climate refugees**]{.underline} towards
areas that still are unaffected by the change. If we thought the impact
was huge from the people fleeing the Syrian civil war, or the present
corona pandemic, we should expect the climate disaster to be countless
times larger. [The pressure on **societies**]{.underline} and
intergovernmental organisations [will become **tremendous**,
and]{.underline} we would be naïve if we did not expect this pressure to
[create **additional** suffering and death]{.underline}. What is then
the cause of [climate change]{.underline}? It [is the result of
**anthropogenic acts**]{.underline}, i.e., it is our current way of
living that is causing the heating of the planet. Like a greenhouse, our
planet is becoming hotter by the way that carbon dioxide traps more heat
in the atmosphere, and by consequent increase the global average
temperature. Additionally, [it sets off other **reactions** that add
**positive feedback** to the warming]{.underline}, e.g., creation of
water vapour or the reduction of ice caps.

Now, this paper does not intend to demonstrate the truth of these
claims, and if the reader is still sceptical about climate change, and
its anthropogenic cause, numerous [sources]{.underline} can justify and
explain these facts better, for instance, rapports [from
**IPCC**]{.underline}. 2 Accordingly, I will [assume these facts to be
true, and that climate change will cause]{.underline} a state of affairs
that contains a great deal of suffering and death; besides the
possibility of [**civilisational destruction** or **human
extinction**]{.underline}. Thus, the circumstances are dire. So, let us
summarise these detrimental effects into a single claim. Here it is:

> State Of Affairs No Reduction: A state of affairs where climate change
> causes tens of millions of deaths, countless instances of additional
> human suffering, and the possibility of causing a collapse of human
> life as we know it.

This is what I will take as the effect of doing nothing to halt climate
change. This then begs the question: If our current behaviour has such
terrible consequences, why have we not implemented policies that prevent
climate change?

1.2 What is the nature of the problem?

There are two ways to answer this question: we can give a historical
description of how the issue has been misconstrued by interests that
have a lot to gain from the status quo or, that we are dealing with a
special type of problem that is particularly difficult for us to
confront.3 In this paper I will only deal with the second dimension.
Additionally, we can divide this dimension into two groups: first, we
can describe how humans, by their very nature, are poorly endowed to
deal with such problems as climate change, secondly, that the problem of
climate change is what sociologists call a "wicked problem". I will
discuss the first aspect later on when describing psychological
barriers. Now, I want to address characterising climate change as a
wicked problem.

During the ozone depletion, discovered in the late seventies, the
world's states quickly came together and implemented the Wien protocol
in 1985; a protocol that set down some policies for protecting the ozone
layer. Subsequently, in 1987 the Montreal Protocol was implemented, that
resulted in the complete removal of the chemical substances that created
the ozone depletion.4 Why have we not seen the same collective action
towards climate change? Well, first, we must clarify that in the case of
the ozone depletion, the solution was much easier to implement; it took
the removal of a few ozone-depleting substances. However, solving the
problem of climate change is much more wicked (supposedly) and is said
to fall under a specific type of problem posited by Horst Rittel in the
late 1960s; wicked problems.5 These are deep problems that do not
present you with a clear solution. Now, my initial definition of the
problem seems to fly against this deepness, i.e., I have claimed there
is a clear solution. However, those that see it as a wicked problem
would contend that my definition is only one way to conceptualise the
problem, and that there is a spectrum of definitions that seem more or
less correct. What does this mean? Dale Jameison describes this well:

> "There are many different ways of conceptualising the problem of
> climate change, each of which finds different resources relevant to
> its solution and counts different response as success and failures. If
> the problem is fundamentally one of global governance, then new
> agreements and institutions are what are needed. If the problem is
> market failure, then carbon taxes or a cap and trade system is what is
> required. If the problem is primarily a technological failure, then we
> need an Apollo program for clean energy or perhaps geoengineering. If
> climate change is just the latest way for the global rich to exploit
> the global poor, then the time has come for a global struggle for
> justice. This problem of multiple frames is characteristic of what are
> called "wicked problems." And wicked problems are extremely difficult
> for political systems to address successfully."6

I understand the appeal to find all these different ways to
conceptualise the problem of climate change. However, I do believe we
are doing ourselves a disfavour if we explain the lack of action in
preventing climate change, and by consequent justify this inaction, by
appealing to this problem of multiple frames. We should ask why it is of
benefit to consider all these multiple frames when trying to stop
climate change? I take it that the answer to this is our desire for
finding the most accurate conceptualisation of the problem so that we
can implement the most optimal solution. I believe this is wrong. At its
core, we know the solution to the problem (reduce greenhouse gases) and
we should accept the risk that we will implement a sub-optimal solution.
Waiting around for the most accurate conceptualisation of the problem is
counterintuitive, especially when we contemplate the risk it entails.
The goal should not be too solve this problem of multiple frames by, for
instance, taking steps to secure a unanimous acceptance of some
particular framing of the problem, and by consequent enact the most
optimal solution to climate change. Setting this as our aim is just to
promote even more inaction; we need to accept a sub-optimal solution. I
believe this desire to find the optimal solution which does not entail
people having to accept a reduction in their current standard (no one
gets elected by promising to reduce economic growth and causing other
detrimental effects on their electorate) better explains our inaction
then characterising climate change as a wicked problem. As Broome
writes: "the economics and politics of climate change has concentrated
on finding the best solution to the problem of climate change."7 Meaning
that we are looking for a solution without sacrifice --- and by
consequent choose business as usual.

Nevertheless, I believe we should not put too much importance on the
wickedness of the problem. We know what it takes, and our technological
achievements are well-equipped to deal with the problem (since it also
has created the problem). Implementing some policies that reduce
greenhouse gases is better, even if they are sub-optimal, then
postponing taking any preventive measures.

Nevertheless, before closing this section, [there is one]{.underline}
more [aspect of the problem of climate change that we ought to face; the
need for **immediate action**. This aspect is of **high
importance**]{.underline}, and we should not take it lightly; even
though it fills a short space in this paper. Climate change has been
going on for a long time, and [year by year we increase the yearly
outpour of **g**reen**h**ouse **g**ases into the
atmosphere]{.underline}, e.g., the last year (2019) we increase the
outpour even more.8 Additionally, [we are taking a risk when we do not
know what **positive feedback** we are potentially setting off by not
reducing the outpour. Accordingly]{.underline}, we need to accept the
fact that the problem of [climate change has the character of
**demanding** our **immediate action**]{.underline}.

1.3 Clarifications

Before turning to the argumentation for this paper's thesis, some
clarifications are necessary. One of these is the role of "political
authority". When I argue that we have good reasons to prefer an
epistocracy, I am arguing that we ought to accept the epistocratic
method as the political authority and that this authority is legitimate,
i.e., it has some moral justification for establishing a normative
relation between it (political authority) and the subjects. There are
several conceptual accounts of "political authority", and I will use the
right to rule account. This account portrays a more morally robust
account of the relation between an authority and a subject. It
essentially describes a kind of ideal political community where a deeper
moral connection is present. 9 I believe this is what we think of when
trying to evaluate the legitimacy that a political system, as in a
state, have in coercing a population, and the subjects have a moral duty
to obey the authority. This will be the conceptual definition of
political authority. It has a moral right to rule and coerce people into
obeying its political system of institutions that regulate the behaviour
of its subjects and set out the course for where the political entity is
heading, i.e., which state of affairs we realise in the future.

2\. INTRODUCING THE SOLUTION

In this section, I will demonstrate why we ought to accept The Solution
as a true normative claim, i.e., why we ought to take political action
to prevent State Of Affairs No Reduction from coming into existence.10
Here is the claim:

> [The **Solution**: Reduce the **global outpour** of greenhouse gases
> to a **level** that has an excellent chance of causing the
> **avoidance** of State Of Affairs No Reduction]{.underline}.

[One]{.underline} helpful [way to characterise the normativity of The
Solution is as a **navigational problem**. **Where** do we want our
**global society** to be **heading**?]{.underline} I believe [we can
characterise the possible directions as]{.underline} a
**[binary]{.underline}** choice [between The Solution and Not-The
Solution]{.underline}. The second option I describe as follows:

> Not-The Solution: Continue the outpour of greenhouse gases with the
> consequences that State Of Affairs No Reduction has an excellent
> chance of being actualised.

Now, [even though The Solution contains **multiple ways** to get
**implemented**, they **all** share the **same normative content** of
causing a **reduction of greenhouse gases** in the
atmosphere]{.underline}.11 Accordingly, it is [this **goal**, and how it
**dictates**]{.underline} the **[changes needed in]{.underline}** our
global **[institutions]{.underline}** that [are of]{.underline} such
**[vital importance]{.underline}**. By contrast, Not-The Solution shares
the same normative content of taking no action that will prevent State
Of Affairs No Reduction. Given this binary choice, I believe our
intuition tells us that we ought to choose The Solution. What could
speak in favour of Not-The Solution? Is there some option of Not-The
Solution that we have a better reason to prefer? Maybe someone would
contend that the uncertainty that surrounds climate change gives us good
reasons to postpone taking any action, or, that other goals are much
more important. Now, before addressing these concerns, perhaps our
intuition becomes stronger (that we ought to choose The Solution) if I
provide some scenario that could work as an intuition pump. Here is such
a scenario:

> *The Bus Ride*: So, picture, if you will, a bus that is on a direct
> course towards a large tree that will cause a great deal of suffering
> and death upon impact. Inside, the people are busy doing whatever they
> see fit, spending their time to make the bus ride as comfortable and
> meaningful as possible. However, there is a group of scientists that
> have analysed and investigated the devastating effect of this course,
> and that they need to perform some necessary action to avoid the tree.
> Perhaps they all need to drop what they are doing and give up some of
> their time jolting the bus enough so that the bus will miss the tree.

Accordingly, the world is the bus, the people on the bus is the world's
population, and the jolting of the bus is The Solution.12 I believe our
intuition tells us that we ought to perform the necessary actions in
order to prevent the bus from hitting the tree. What could possibly be
more pressing? Do we have good reasons to do something else? Is the
uncertainty of how bad the impact will be, and when it will occur, good
reasons to not start jolting the bus?

Weighing different values against each other is tricky, and there are
many scenarios where it is contentious if we should promote, for
instance, equality or liberty. Some could argue that we ought to
increase economic prosperity since it will maximise well-being for all
humans; others will argue that securing peace takes priority; social
justice; or environmental concerns. However, [**whatever we see as the**
road to the **common good** the implementation of The Solution is
**superior** in its **importance**, because it **secures** that **there
will be a ground** to put the road on. We will **certainly not** have
**social harmony** in a state of affairs where **climate disaster is
present**; the **economy will suffer** the consequences of the climatic
impact on everything from production to transfer, and we have good
reasons to believe **conflict and tension will arise** when the
situation gets worse]{.underline}.

Now, perhaps [some could say]{.underline} that [it is immoral to
demand]{.underline} that [people make sacrifices]{.underline} to reduce
greenhouse gases. I believe [this is **wrong**]{.underline}. The
implementation of The Solution will not demand a tremendous amount of
hardship for the effect world population.13 Like Peter Singer's case
where we should sacrifice our clothes in order to save a child from
drowning in a pond, we ought to sacrifice some niceties in order to save
ourselves, and future generation from State Of Affairs No Reduction.14
Accordingly, the sacrifices necessary do not entail some morally
questionable acts, i.e., reduce the level of greenhouse gases by killing
off a portion of humans. I am talking about, for example, having to
reduce flying to a necessary minimum, or, pay more in taxes so we can
develop, and build, the technology that reduces the outpour of
greenhouse gases, e.g., solar panels. Furthermore, it is [the
**affluent** world]{.underline} that will have to bear the biggest load
of these necessary sacrifices. Especially, since the cause of climate
change comes from the increased material standard enjoyed by people in
affluent countries. They [should]{.underline}, by consequent,
[accept]{.underline} the [**moral responsibility** to combat the harm
this wealth is causing, and going to cause]{.underline}. Or, put
differently, the economic prosperity that has created this wealth is the
cause of the climatic change, and the cost of emitting greenhouse gases
has been an externality unaccounted for by either the consumers or the
producers (a Pareto sub-optimal state of affairs). Additionally, it is
common-sensical that if one group have very few resources, and another
group has an abundance of resources, we should not solve a common
problem by removing the few resources from the first group. The harm
created by the amount of resources in the prosperous group should yield
a good reason for them, bearing the bigger load.

Additionally, we should also accept that since anthropogenic acts cause
State Of Affairs No Reduction, it leaves us with an additional moral
reason to implement The Solution (leaving aside just the badness of
State Of Affairs No Reduction). We bear the responsibilities of our
actions, and these actions will harm countless future human beings.15
Even if we do not bear the responsibility of stopping climate change
individually, we should not prevent our institutions from being reshaped
in a way that solves the problem of climate change. I would even
contend, if we are living in a democracy, we have a moral duty to use
our political power (vote), so we take the necessary steps to implement
something like The Solution.16 (Perhaps, this could also be interpreted
as a reason for restricting universal suffrage (the democratic process)
and justify an global epistocracy.) Possibly, in a counterfactual world
where a non-anthropogenic event will cause a similar type of harm (for
instance an impact by a meteorite), it could be argued that we have no
responsibility to prevent this event since we are not the actors that
create this event. I believe this is a weak argument for not preventing
the impact from the meteorite. However, in the case of climate change
that argumentation is not available since we are responsible for it.

One final thing is that The Solution is hardly a discriminatory or
biased policy. Certainly, different groups will be affected
differentially by the policy, and, as have been said, the affluent part
of the world should bear the biggest load. However, the policy itself
places no higher importance on any person or group. Satisfying, what
Vandamme calls, a quality of (substantive) impartiality: "understood in
a moral and substantive sense, as a property of public policies and of a
political order, can be simply defined as not favouring some groups or
individuals over others for morally arbitrary reasons."17

2.1 Uncertainty of Climate Change

What then about uncertainty and the effect it has on the normativity of
The Solution? Perhaps, [someone would argue that since there is still
**uncertainty**]{.underline} in the range of negative impact that
climate change will have, and the lack of knowledge when things will
start to get truly harmful, [we can delay making any decision until the
facts are in]{.underline}. I believe [this is **wrong**]{.underline}. As
Broome writes: "If you can costlessly delay a decision till all the
information is in, you should delay it. But [when **delay itself** is
risky, it is not a sensible remark]{.underline}."18 [Choosing Not-The
Solution and thus **gamble** in the hope that it will not have the
consequence of suffering and death]{.underline} in order to avoid making
a sub-optimal decision, that in hindsight is evaluated as unnecessary
[is]{.underline}, I believe, [immoral and irrational]{.underline}.19
Accordingly, [in the same way]{.underline} that [it is rational to
invest in a fire extinguisher]{.underline}, in case a fire starts in
your house, [it is rational to invest in]{.underline} the [removal of
the possibility of a climate disaster]{.underline} in the future. Why is
this? I believe that Expected Value Theory is a good guide to adopt when
facing uncertainty. Broome summarises this theory nicely:

> "When the quantitative outcome of some process is uncertain, the
> expectation of the outcome is calculated as follows. Take each of the
> possible values of the outcome and multiply each by the probability of
> its occurring. Add up all of these products. The sum is the
> expectation. It is just a weighted average outcome, where the weights
> are the probabilities."20

Even if it is a very small probability that climate change will have
civilisational ending results, the great badness that this state of
affairs constitutes should warrant our immediate action to avoid this
scenario. Perhaps, there could be a case for not implementing The
Solution if it would demand a large number of sacrifices, and by
delaying this implementation we could remove additional uncertainty. For
instance, what if people in The Bus Ride had to kill fifty per cent of
the passengers, by throwing them off the bus, in order to avoid the
tree. Certainly, given this tremendous sacrifice an argument could be
had why we should delay implementing necessary precautions. However,
even though the aggregation, of the small sacrifices every individual
has to make, could become large, it does not constitute this tremendous
sacrifice in The Bus Ride. The small sacrifices everyone have to make is
easily overshadowed by the badness of State Of Affairs No Reduction.
Accordingly, I still take it that we have better reasons to prefer The
Solution than Not-The Solution even though climate change will always be
immersed in uncertainty. We only have one opportunity to run this
experiment, so we should not gamble with the outcome.

Nevertheless, I will not try and persuade the reader more of the badness
of State Of Affairs No Reduction and that we ought to implement the
Solution. Possibly, the discussion of the next section will bear some
support for the accuracy of The Solution.

3\. THE ANSWER

What we then must ask ourselves is: Which process for collective
decision-making do we have reasons to believe will successfully
implement The Solution? We could start with an unhelpful answer: The
method that has the best chance to implement The Solution. Which method
is this then? Here we get to the core of this paper's thesis. I will
call the answer to this question simply: The Answer. Here it is:

> The Answer: [Given that we ought to implement The
> Solution]{.underline}, and by consequent avoid State Of Affairs No
> Reduction, [we have **better reasons** to prefer some form of global
> **epistocracy**, than a global **democracy**]{.underline}.

#### It's the [only]{.underline} existential risk

A devastating fact of climate collapse is that there may be a silver
lining to the mushroom cloud. First, it should be noted that a [nuclear
exchange does not inevitably result in apocalyptic loss of life. Nuclear
winter]{.underline}---the idea that firestorms would make the earth
uninhabitable---[is based on shaky science. There's no reliable model
that can determine how many megatons would decimate **ag**riculture or
make humans extinct. Nations have already detonated 2,476 nuclear
devices]{.underline}.

An exchange that shuts down the global economy but stops short of human
extinction may be the only blade realistically likely to cut the carbon
knot we're trapped within. It would decimate existing infrastructures,
providing an opportunity to build new energy infrastructure and
intervene in the current investments and subsidies keeping fossil fuels
alive.

In the near term, emissions would almost certainly rise as militaries
are some of the world's largest emitters. Given what we know of human
history, though, conflict may be the only way to build the mass social
cohesion necessary for undertaking the kind of huge, collective action
needed for global sequestration and energy transition. Like the 20th
century's world wars, a nuclear exchange could serve as an economic
leveler. It could provide justification for nationalizing energy
industries with the interest of shuttering fossil fuel plants and
transitioning to renewables and, uh, nuclear energy. It could shock us
into reimagining a less suicidal civilization, one that dethrones the
death-cult zealots who are currently in power. And it may toss
particulates into the atmosphere sufficient to block out some of the
solar heat helping to drive global warming. Or it may have the opposite
effects. Who knows?

What we do know is that [humans can **survive** and **recover** from
war, probably **even a nuclear one**. Humans can**not** recover from
runaway **climate** change. **Nuclear war is not an inevitable
extinction event**; six degrees of **warming is**]{.underline}.
