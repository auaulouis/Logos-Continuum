[The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has **[advanced
legislation]{.mark}** introduced by U.S. Sen. Susan Collins (D-ME) that
authorizes funding, provides legal authorities, and **[improves]{.mark}
[congressional Intelligence community oversight]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
The committee passed the **[[I]{.mark}ntelligence [A]{.mark}uthorization
[A]{.mark}ct for Fiscal Year 2023 (S. 4503)]{.underline}** by a
unanimous 16-0 vote. "The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
[2023 [will enhance]{.mark} the Intelligence Community's [ability to arm
policy-makers with the necessary info]{.mark}rmation and tools to defend
U.S. interests against foreign adversaries,"]{.underline} Collins said.
"The bill bolsters intelligence support for Ukraine, improves the
timeliness of the security clearance process, takes a major step forward
to promote cybersecurity, and increases congressional oversight of the
Intelligence Community." [[Bill provisions include improving]{.mark}
Ukraine's [intell]{.mark}igence amid the country defending its
territorial integrity and sovereignty since Russia's second invasion;
establishing cybersecurity minimum standards for classified networks and
systems; ensuring continued support to the victims of anomalous health
incidents or Havana Syndrome and **[maintaining continued

[[The Admin]{.mark}istration [strongly supports enactment of a]{.mark}
National Defense Authorization Act [(NDAA)]{.mark} for a 62nd
consecutive year and is grateful for the strong, bipartisan work of the
House Armed Services Committee on behalf of America's national
defense.]{.underline} The Administration looks forward to continuing to
work with the Congress to set appropriate and responsible levels of
defense and non-defense spending to support the security of the Nation.
Alongside a strategically sound defense budget, a strong economy and
investments in diplomacy, development, and economic statecraft are
critical to ensuring that the Nation is positioned to respond to the
myriad of national security challenges we face today and in the future.
The Department of Defense's (DoD) Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 budget request
was informed by the National Defense Strategy, which calls on DoD to
advance four key priorities: defend the homeland, deter strategic
attacks, deter aggression while being prepared to prevail in conflict
when necessary, and build a resilient Joint Force and defense ecosystem.
Taking care of the All-Volunteer force, their families, and DoD civilian
employees and contractors is vital to ensuring a resilient military
today and in the future. It is an Administration priority, and President
Biden appreciates support for the pay raise for military service
members[. [In a time of rapidly evolving]{.mark} military activities and
[capabilities]{.mark} by our competitors -- [accelerated by emerging
techn]{.mark}ologies and intensified by the potential for new threats to
strategic stability -- America's network of allies and partners
continues to act as a force multiplier in support of U.S. national
defense.]{.underline} Investments authorized in the NDAA in support of
the Pacific Deterrence Initiative and the European Deterrence Initiative
will help address the changing global landscape and prepare the country
for future challenges and threats. The Administration looks forward to
working with the Congress to address its concerns, a number of which are
outlined below. Establishment of Army and Air Force Safety Commands**[.
[The Administration places a high priority on safety]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} has multiple [ongoing efforts to improve DoD wide
governance of safety incidents.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The
Administration opposes section 386 because such a reorganization would
hinder these ongoing efforts, including the establishment and chartering
of the Joint Safety Council as directed in the FY 2022 NDAA,
implementing the 25 recommendations of the National Commission on
Military Aviation Safety, [**[reinvigorating]{.mark}** the Defense
Safety **[Oversight]{.mark} Council**, and [codifying]{.mark}
Department-wide safety business [processes and data standards]{.mark} to
support a proactive enterprise risk management approach.]{.underline}

"Balancing Oversight and Risk: Transparency for U.S. Foreign Assistance
to Ukraine",
https://www.csis.org/analysis/balancing-oversight-and-risk-transparency-us-foreign-assistance-ukraine)LR

[[Since]{.mark} [Russia's]{.mark} unprovoked [invasion of
Ukraine]{.mark} in February, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has
[provided]{.mark} [unprecedented levels of security]{.mark}, economic,
and humanitarian [assistance]{.mark} to Ukraine.]{.underline} This
assistance reflects the United States' remarkable commitment to a
country fighting for its right to exist as a sovereign democratic
country. [In two separate packages, Congress has appropriated \$54
billion in assistance to Ukraine. On an inflation-adjusted basis, the
United States has already allocated more money for assistance to Ukraine
in the past five months than it did on a yearly basis during the height
of the Marshall Plan]{.underline}. Given the unprecedented levels of
assistance, and [that Ukraine has a history with corruption issues**,
[proper oversight]{.mark}** of these funds [will be
**critical**]{.mark}. The most recent bill faced a delay due to
oversight concerns. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) held up the bill because he
wanted to appoint the leader of the watchdog of Afghanistan's
reconstruction (Special Inspector General for Afghanistan
Reconstruction, or SIGAR), John F. Sopko, to take on a similar position
to provide oversight for Ukraine's reconstruction.]{.underline} Senator
Paul's concerns are the same that he voices with every piece of foreign
assistance legislation; however, 10 other Republican senators and 57
Republican House members also ultimately joined him in voting against
the final spending bills. The assistance bill eventually passed
Congress, but the delay reflects what will likely be increasing calls
for oversight on foreign assistance to Ukraine. [[Since 2014]{.mark},
Ukraine has made [significant]{.mark} [progress in transparency]{.mark},
including through the digitization of city planning and public
procurement, monitoring of public officials\' assets and lifestyles, and
investigative journalism, yet endemic corruption remains a
challenge.]{.underline} Estimates in 2021 still showed that Ukraine's
budget was losing \$37 billion a year due to corruption. In recent
months, Kyiv has in some cases returned to relying on oligarchs for
government funding of both immediate assistance and future
reconstruction, which opens the door for oligarchs to be able to promote
their self-interest through the government. [Down the line, instances of
corruption, and especially misuse of foreign assistance, could cost
Ukraine its good standing and endanger further aid from the United
States. Oversight for U.S. assistance to Ukraine is necessary to ensure
continued support for aid packages by both the American public and the
congresspeople who represent them.]{.underline} But it is not clear that
more oversight than what is already provided by the inspectors general
at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the State
Department is needed. In addition, the recent supplemental Ukraine bill
included additional provisions related to the direct economic assistance
provided to Ukraine. [An [additional layer of oversight]{.mark} along
the lines of the special inspectors general used in Iraq and Afghanistan
is not immediately necessary. Indeed, such an approach could hinder the
effective delivery of foreign assistance at a time when speed,
flexibility, and effectiveness should guide U.S. support for
Ukraine]{.underline}. [Presently, the [necessary mechanisms to create
immediate accountability]{.mark} for U.S. assistance to Ukraine largely
[exist]{.mark}, and the [funding bill passed included]{.mark} several
[additional oversight mechanisms]{.mark}.]{.underline} The most recent
aid package to Ukraine included over \$8 billion in direct economic
assistance to Ukraine's government. The spending bill include
requirements that these funds are subject to a memorandum of
understanding between the U.S. government and government of Ukraine that
includes descriptions of how the funds will be used. Additionally, the
money must be kept in a separate account that cannot be combined with
other funds. The bill also asked for reporting from the State Department
and USAID, specifically noting that "the Secretary of State or the
Administrator of USAID, as appropriate, shall report to the appropriate
congressional committees on the uses of any funds provided for direct
financial support to the Government of Ukraine . . . and the results
achieved, not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act
and every 90 days thereafter." [This [funding]{.mark} [for
oversight]{.mark} and legislative provisions will [provide]{.mark}
[transparency]{.mark} over the economic support funds provided directly
to the government of Ukraine.]{.underline} Finally, the bill also
included funding for oversight of various U.S. agencies' spending,
including \$5 million for the Department of State inspector general and
\$1 million for the USAID inspector general. This additional money
provides the Office of Inspector General at both agencies with the
resources needed to monitor assistance for Ukraine. [[The pressure for
effective oversight]{.mark} of the large amount of money appropriated to
support Ukraine's defense of its country [is
understandable]{.mark}.]{.underline} There are real and serious concerns
about the level of corruption in prewar Ukraine; however, there is
little evidence that this corruption has affected the significant
volumes of aid that Ukraine has received since the 2014 Maidan
revolution. Given the stakes involved---Ukraine's continued existence as
an independent, democratic state---there is significant incentive for
the government in Kyiv to ensure that the money provided is put to its
intended uses. On the other hand[, the relevant U.S. agencies must
respond to congressional demands for oversight and work with Ukrainian
partners in a transparent way to highlight the significant impact
foreign assistance is having on the outcome of the war.]{.underline} The
U.S. government must utilize existing mechanisms to demonstrate
transparency and provide accountability to Congress on this important
money. [[Political dynamics in Congress]{.mark} [demand]{.mark} that
[the admin]{.mark}istration [do so]{.mark}. [Otherwise]{.mark}, the flow
of aid may stop, or [additional oversight mechanisms will be created
that disincentivize]{.mark} [the necessary risk-taking]{.mark} critical
for Ukraine's success both during the war and throughout subsequent
reconstruction efforts.]{.underline}

### Asats\-\--Link

#### Satellites specifically cause overstretch due to infighting

**Best 02** (Richard A. Best, Jr Specialist in National Defense Foreign
Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division. "CRS Report for Congress Received
through the CRS Web Order Code RL31369 Imagery Intelligence: Issues for
Congress", https://irp.fas.org/crs/RL31369.pdf)LR

[[Intelligence derived from satellites]{.mark} has become [an essential
element]{.mark} of military operations and foreign policymaking. In
particular, precise imagery from space-based collection systems makes
possible the effective use of precision-guided munitions that is
becoming the basis of U.S. defense planning.]{.underline} Imagery
intelligence also provides the factual bases for addressing many foreign
policy issues. [[Imagery is collected by satellites acquired and
operated by]{.mark} the National Reconnaissance Office ([NRO]{.mark}),
an organization with a record of enormous technological achievements
since its creation in 1961]{.underline}. Imagery collected by the NRO is
processed, analyzed, exploited, and disseminated by another
organization, the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA). NIMA was
established in 1996, incorporating the Defense Mapping Agency and
various intelligence offices. Congress has been concerned with satellite
imagery because of its critical importance and its high costs.
Independent commissions established by Congress to assess the state of
the imagery intelligence effort have concluded that significant changes
need to be made in the way the Nation's imagery effort is conducted.
There is a consensus that greater emphasis should be placed on better
collection targeting and improving processing, exploitation, and
dissemination (the processes collectively termed TPED); that greater
attention should be given to acquiring commercial imagery; and that the
management of the imagery effort may need to be changed. Even before the
events of September 11, 2001, there appeared to be a fairly widespread
view within congressional committees that at least some additional
funding should be directed towards imagery collection and TPED.
Subsequent military campaigns have underscored the use of imagery in
military operations and other counterterrorist efforts. NIMA may not be
ready to accept such a broad role within the Intelligence Community.
According to a media account, Robert Zitz, a senior NIMA official, has
stated that for the present integrating imagery and geospatial data and
imagery remains the agency's primary focus; "right now," according to
Zitz, "we don't feel that we are ready to take on the challenge of doing
imagery and signals intelligence both in one architecture."23 NIMA
officials undoubtedly recognize that such fusion would not only be
technically challenging but it could involve conflicts with other,
older, and larger agencies that could complicate NIMA's overall
missions. Peter Marino, the chairman of the NIMA Commission, inApril 3,
2001 testimony, indicated continuing concern that NIMA lacks adequate
resources for such a task: and I think what you're creating is a recipe
for disaster for the day when \[FIA\] starts dropping down volumes of
data that is considerably greater than the volumes of data that we're
seeing today and expects an organization like NIMA to start processing
and exploiting that data. That doesn't close at all right now with the
budget that NIMA has to do TPED.24 Beyond questions of resources, some
observers express concern that the heavy responsibility of managing a
multi-int geospatial grid would be assigned to a relatively new
organization that is a DOD combat support agency. According to this
view, developing and acquiring the necessary systemsthat manage the flow
of imagery will be a daunting task that NIMA will probably be able to
accomplish only with additional funding and by drawing upon outside
assistance. They suggest that establishment of collection
requirements--determining which targets should get the highest
priorities--more appropriately should become the responsibility of the
DCI who has, in any event, been assigned the responsibility by
statute.25 [Nor do they believe would NIMA be a logical candidate to
address the tasking of the sigint collection efforts of the National
Security Agency ([NSA]{.mark}) for which longstanding interagency
procedures exist.]{.underline} [[Organizing]{.mark} a [process]{.mark}
by which analysts in various agencies can annotate data on an imagery
base would be a logical NIMA responsibility, [but]{.mark} attempting to
become a "final authority" for validating such annotation would, at
least in some cases, **[appear to be an overstretch]{.mark} that could
[cause prolonged interagency disagreements]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
