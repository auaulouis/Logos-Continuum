The command, in particular, saw its authorities and responsibilities
greatly expanded by the Trump administration and Congress.

Most notably, **[[Cyber Com]{.underline}]{.mark}**mand --- backed by
intelligence from the NSA --- [[has taken a **central role** in
keeping]{.mark} U.S. [**elections** free of]{.mark} **foreign
[interference]{.mark}**. In [2018, the]{.mark} military launched a
campaign called **[O]{.mark}**]{.underline}peration
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ynthetic
**[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**echnology [to [protect the
**midterm**]{.mark} election**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} that year.

[[The effort saw the command deploy]{.mark} "**hunt forward**" [teams to
Eastern Europe; send d]{.mark}]{.underline}irect
[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}essage[[s to]{.mark} Russian **[disinformation
operators]{.mark}** letting them know that they had been **identified**;
[and launch an **offensive strike**]{.mark} that]{.underline}
temporarily [knocked the **I**nternet **R**esearch
**A**gency]{.underline} --- an entity notorious for trying to sow
discord among Americans --- **[offline]{.underline}** in the days around
the election.

[The [organizations]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[took action against
**Iranian hackers**]{.underline}]{.mark} backed by the Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps [in the run-up to the 2020
election]{.underline}. The hackers posed as a far-right group to send
threatening emails to American voters and posted a video to shake
confidence in the U.S. voting process.

Speaking at Vanderbilt, Nakasone said [[the U.S. would face "**many
more**]{.mark}" such **[threats]{.mark}** in the
**future**]{.underline}.

Meeting military service cyber requirements is key to sustaining
critical service investment in the development of cyber capability. The
military services provide the trained [cyber forces that
US**[CYBERCOM]{.mark}** employs]{.underline}. Although part of the joint
cyber team, [the [services]{.mark}]{.underline} nonetheless
[[expect]{.mark} that their **service requirements** and those of their
service components at the combatant com­mands will be met]{.underline} in
kind [with]{.underline} their **[[joint force
contribution]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If service cyber requirements are
underserviced, the services will question their investment. For the
services, [[cyber is a **zero-sum game**. Every]{.mark} **additional
[unit]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} cyber [costs them **another unit**]{.mark}
**of capacity [elsewhere]{.mark}** [in the force]{.mark}]{.underline}. A
theater cyber C2 structure that obscures service contributions or
weakens the link between the service, [[its]{.mark} **operational**
cyber units and its]{.underline} various service [**component
[requirements]{.mark}** [risks losing]{.mark} **ser­vice
[interest]{.mark}** [and **investment** in **developing

According to a 12 November 2020 joint statement of U.S. election
officials, [the [2020]{.mark}]{.underline} U.S. presidential [[election
"was the **most secure**]{.underline}]{.mark} in American history."
[That success [was a result]{.mark}]{.underline} not
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} accident, but instead of [[**deliberate**,
**sustained**, and **comprehensive**]{.mark} efforts at the]{.underline}
local, state, and [**federal** levels to ensure that it was secure from
**foreign interference**. Those efforts to **secure the election** were
borne out of the attempts by]{.underline} the [Russia]{.underline}n
government [to **influence** the outcome of the 2016]{.underline} U.S.
presidential [election]{.underline}. In the end, however, [the efforts
to **enhance** the **[cybersecurity]{.mark}** of the U.S. electoral
infrastructure in 2020 ended up protecting the **integrity** of the
election]{.underline} not only [[from **malign foreign
activities**]{.underline}]{.mark}, but [also [from **domestic**]{.mark}
anti-democratic and **[illiberal efforts]{.mark}** to undermine
**confidence**]{.underline} in the 2020 presidential election.

[In 2020, the threats **compounded** as **compared** to
2016]{.underline}.

A range of [[activities designed to protect]{.mark} the American
[**election infrastructure** from]{.mark} foreign [**malign activity**
ended up providing a **bulwark** against]{.mark} **threatening [domestic
efforts]{.mark}** [to undermine]{.mark}]{.underline} and overturn
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} lawful [[election
**result**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The U.S. experience in 2020 suggests
that **[[cybersecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}** itself [can [play a
**critical role** in protecting]{.mark} not only **[election
infrastructure]{.mark}**]{.underline} as a technical matter, [[but also
providing]{.mark} a **technical [basis]{.mark}** [to counter **illiberal
forces**]{.mark} as a mechanism to **protect the democratic process** of
conducting a fair election. **[Cybersecurity]{.mark}**]{.underline}
itself just [[may have **saved U.S. democracy**]{.mark} from **careening
of the rails**, [continued]{.mark} **sustained [efforts]{.mark}** to
continue [to harden election]{.mark} infrastructure
[cybersecurity]{.mark}]{.underline} and create a cadre of trusted
officials, [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[be needed]{.mark}
again]{.underline}.

Marsh

[[Democracy is **under assault**]{.mark}. **China** and
**Russia**]{.underline} are [pursuing]{.underline} strategic campaigns
[to undermine liberal values]{.underline} and U.S. leadership.
Authoritarians from Belarus to Burma brutalize their citizens to stay in
power. The debacle of U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and our
national soul-searching in the wake of the 20th anniversary of 9/11 led
some to wonder if support for [[**democracy** should remain a component
of]{.underline}]{.mark} [**American** foreign
**[policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 

[**[The]{.mark}** hard [**truth** is]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[a
world]{.underline}]{.mark} that is [[less free is one]{.mark} that is
[**less secure**, **stable** and **prosperous**]{.mark}.  The greatest
**dangers** to]{.underline} the American way of [**life** emanate
from]{.underline} hostile **[autocracies]{.underline}**. There are no
quick fixes, but [[the]{.mark} best [**antidotes**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the challenges of [[**great-power conflict**,
**terror**]{.mark}**ism** [and]{.mark} mass
**[migration]{.mark}**]{.underline} of desperate refugees [[lie
in]{.underline}]{.mark} the building of inclusive **[[democratic
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- [and working with]{.underline}
allied [**democracies** to sustain the **free** and **open
order**]{.underline} that China, in particular, wishes to replace with a
world that's safe for autocracy.  

The conventional wisdom that authoritarianism has popular momentum is
wrong. No one anywhere is taking to the street to demand more corrupt
governance, the adoption of one-man rule, a stronger surveillance state,
or greater intervention by malign foreign powers.

Democratic freedoms are unquestionably under assault in many nations.
Autocrats are aggressive precisely because of the growing demands for
change in their more modern, connected societies --- and the rising risk
that middle classes in nations such as China and Russia will not be
willing forever to forfeit political rights for prosperity.

[American **retrenchment** and **isolationism** **compound the
danger**]{.underline}. It would be nice to live in a world where failed
states and dictatorships were a problem for someone else to worry about.
But rather than producing stability, [[Western
**retreat**]{.underline}]{.mark} only **[[emboldens
autocrats]{.underline}]{.mark}** in ways [[that **amplify
danger**]{.mark}s to American **national security**]{.underline}. 

We know that violent extremism flourishes under state failure and
dictatorship. Broken states become breeding grounds for extremist groups
because they leave vacuums that terrorists are only too happy to fill.
[In [nations **without democratic accountability**]{.mark},
citizens]{.underline} become [[draw]{.underline}]{.mark}n
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the only [forms of
[expression]{.mark}]{.underline} available to them, [which are often
[**violent** and **extreme**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 

The good news is that we have billions of allies around the world:
citizens on every continent chafing for greater freedom and dignity.
They do not want U.S. military-led nation-building.  They want peaceful
support for their independent efforts to create democratic space in
systems distorted by overweening government control, dangerous
governance gaps and foreign malign influence.

The free world cannot be neutral in the face of autocracy's resurgence.
Rather, it should play to its strengths. The [**appeal** of democratic
opportunity is a **strategic asset** for the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates --- [**despite** our own
**shortcomings**]{.underline} --- because people around the world
similarly aspire to live in societies that guarantee justice, rights and
dignity.  

[America's]{.underline} closest [allies are democracies. [Democracies
**don't fight each other**]{.mark}, **export** violent **extremism**, or
**produce** the **conflicts** that drive mass migration.
[Democracies]{.mark}]{.underline} are better partners [in
**[fight]{.mark}**ing **[terror]{.mark}**ism]{.underline}, human
trafficking [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} poverty, as well [as
[establish]{.mark}ing]{.underline} reliable [**[trad]{.mark}**ing
relationships]{.underline}.  

[[Open societies **incubate**]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nologies [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} will
help [[solve the **world's**]{.mark} **most pressing
[problems]{.mark}**[, including]{.mark} **[climate]{.mark}
change**]{.underline}. Citizens can hold leaders accountable when they
fall short, and democratic institutions are stronger than any man --- as
America itself witnessed after the assault on the U.S. Capitol on Jan.

### 2NC\-\--Uniqueness\-\--Resources

#### CYBERCOM's budget is [tight]{.underline}, but [sufficient]{.underline} to cover its [current tasks]{.underline}.

Michael S. **Rogers 18**, former United States Navy admiral who served
as the second commander of the United States Cyber Command giving a
statement for a House Hearing, "HEARING ON NATIONAL DEFENSE
AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 AND OVERSIGHT OF PREVIOUSLY
AUTHORIZED PROGRAMS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES ONE HUNDRED FIFTEENTH CONGRESS FIRST SESSION,"
https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-115hhrg25869/html/CHRG-115hhrg25869.htm,

As we begin the process of looking at the 2018 budget, I am interested
to know to what extent you were able to factor in strategy and threats
and sort of strategic thinking about what needs to be done as you put
together [[the **budget** for **Cyber Com**]{.mark}**mand**]{.underline}
and to what extent you have still been hamstrung by the BCA and by those
cap numbers.

Admiral Rogers. So like any entity, it [[is]{.mark} **all [about
prioritization]{.mark}**]{.underline} for us. So [we spend a **lot of
time**]{.underline} figuring out with finite resources, even with
growth, [[with **finite resources**]{.mark} how are we going to
prioritize]{.underline}.

So our input for the fiscal year 2018 budget in truth in lending, we
just rolled it out as a government, as a Department this afternoon,
during the midday today, so I have not yet seen the specifics yet. I
know what the broad number for us is, but I haven\'t seen the
sub-elements of that, so I will talk broadly. I apologize, but I will
talk broadly.

For the 2018 input, we tried to identify those priorities. At a macro
sense, in no particular order, I have been arguing manpower; investment
in core capabilities; and then, number three, how can I accelerate
number one and number two, how can I do both of those faster.

Because in some ways, even though as the WannaCrypt ransomware issue
that we have been going through shows, there is capability in the
Department. There are a lot of motivated men and women who are doing
some good work. We were not impacted by WannaCrypt, and that wasn\'t
from a lack of effort.

We had spent significant time starting in March asking ourselves how
might this play out, how do we position ourselves in the case
of\--because Microsoft had put out the patch for the vulnerability. We,
as Microsoft users, saw that and started asking ourselves how might an
opponent attempt to exploit this vulnerability even as we were working
to patch.

It is one of the reasons why we use a defense in-depth strategy. There
is no one single solution. There is no one single way to fix this
problem. It is layers built on top of each other. That really has been
the key to our success.

So we are asking ourselves how can we do this faster. Every day, one of
my biggest concerns is\--and I have never really had this same viewpoint
in almost 36 years of commissioned service\--every day I literally think
to myself, [[we are in a race to generate]{.mark} **more
[capacity]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **more [capability]{.mark}** at the
same time that I am watching a **host of global actors** do the **exact
same thing**]{.underline}.

And so we are trying to sustain both staying up with them, but, quite
frankly, my objective is to get ahead of the problem set. I don\'t like
reacting to things. It is not an effective or efficient way to do
business, and I don\'t think that is what the Nation wants from us.

So until I am able to bore into the specifics of the budget, that kind
of gives you a broad sense of what I thought we needed to focus on.

Ms. Cheney. So would you say, Admiral, that [[the
budget]{.underline}]{.mark} as it has been proposed provides the
resources necessary to regain superiority in areas that we have lost it?

Admiral Rogers. It certainly [[moves us **along that road**, but]{.mark}
no one should think **for one moment** that]{.underline} this mission
set, [not]{.underline} unlike some others, [[is going to require
increased]{.mark} and sustained [investment]{.mark} over
time]{.underline}. This is not going to be a 1 or 2 years we have
increased you by some reasonable number, which has been the case for the
last 2 years, and that is all you are going to need.

If you look at the scope of the challenges associated with this mission
set and from where we are starting, [we have got a lot of **hard work**
**ahead of us**]{.underline}.

#### They're gaining [more autonomy]{.underline} now but skate on [thin ice]{.underline}. 

Lauren **Williams 22**, Senior Editor at FCW, 3/30/2022, "Cyber
Command's acquisition growing pains,"
https://fcw.com/acquisition/2022/03/cyber-commands-acquisition-growing-pains/363836/,
Marsh

U.S. [[Cyber Com]{.underline}]{.mark}mand [[is]{.mark} still
[getting]{.mark} its **[footing]{.mark}**]{.underline} when it comes to
steering acquisitions, [[but **more resources** are needed]{.mark}
especially [as the command gains **more autonomy**]{.mark} over its
**buying** and **budget power**]{.underline}. 

A Government Accountability Office report released March 30 found that
while the command responsible for DOD's cyberspace operations has
matured its Joint Cyber Warfighting Architecture, it doesn't yet have
the metrics needed to justify acquisitions of new capabilities. 

The report states that while Cyber Command has taken necessary steps to
assess the value of JCWA acquisitions, it still needs to develop
outcome-based metrics, per DOD policy, to track whether a capability is
delivering what a mission requires. 

"The command has been slow to determine metrics, in part because of
inexperience conducting Value Assessments and the challenge of
accounting for other factors---like new cyber operations tactics---on
mission outcomes," the report states. "If Cyber Command does not develop
outcome-based metrics to inform future Value Assessments, it risks not
being able to understand whether and how new capabilities benefit the
cyber warfighting mission."

JCWA acquisitions are largely software based and include the data
management-centric Unified Platform, Persistent Cyber Training
Environment, Joint Common Access Platform, and Joint Cyber Command and
Control for situational awareness. Value assessments are evaluations
used to determine whether a capability is worth the investment. 

The watchdog body recommended Cyber Command "develop outcome-based
metrics" that would be used for future acquisition value assessments. 

DOD concurred with the recommendation but in its response noted that
Cyber Command had asked for additional resources to \[enhance\] the
command's ability to develop in this area." A decision on that is
pending with the Office of Management and Budget, according to the
report. identified steps it is taking to develop metrics for future
Value Assessments.

Workforce challenges

But there are also resource challenges, particularly with the workforce,
according to the report.

Cyber Command officials described understaffing in its acquisitions
offices as "creating an all-hands-on-deck atmosphere, with individuals
attempting to address emergent issues regardless of their office's role,
rather than a more coordinated approach."

Additionally, officials told the GAO that staff in its JCWA Integration
Office would need to expand from seven staff to 55 personnel to meet
responsibilities. 

"It will take time to fill additional positions, in part, because Cyber
Command officials said they must first justify and validate the command
has a need before beginning to bolster the workforce in fiscal year
2025," the report states. "Cyber Command has a workforce study underway
that officials anticipate will be complete later in fiscal year 2022."

[[Cyber Com]{.underline}]{.mark}mand [[has]{.mark} long [been looking to
increase its]{.mark} **acquisition [capacity]{.mark}**[, which has been
bolstered by]{.mark} **recent [legislation]{.mark}**]{.underline},
lawmakers' support, [[and **budget requests**]{.underline}]{.mark}. 

The [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} administration[\'s]{.underline} 2023
budget [requests]{.underline} for nearly \$11.2 billion to be spent on
cyber operations, [would help [create five **new**]{.mark} **cyber
[teams]{.mark}**[, while]{.mark} also [investing in
**improvements**]{.mark} to cyber ranges used for **training** and
**exercises**]{.underline}. Some of those funds would go to enhancing
the command's role in acquisition of cyberspace programs and
capabilities, according to the request.

This year, U.S. **[[Cyber Com]{.underline}]{.mark}**mand celebrated its

the status of a unified combatant command, [[its **budget is healthy**,
and]{.underline}]{.mark} its commander, Gen. Paul Nakasone, is popular
on both sides of the aisle. Nakasone's more aggressive posture in
cyberspace --- what the command calls persistent engagement --- [[has
won]{.mark} the [**support** of]{.mark} **policymakers** and
**[legislators]{.mark}** who wanted to see action]{.underline} against
those who had been targeting U.S. interests. Before, U.S. cyber forces
had shown restraint even in the face of repeated cyber attacks. Now,
they will reach out into cyberspace to discover and mitigate threats
before they could reach U.S. networks and damage U.S. interests.

### 2NC\-\--Uniqueness\-\--Ukraine

#### Ukraine ops were [small-scale]{.underline} AND shrouded in [secrecy]{.underline}\-\--can't vote for a thumper you know [nothing about]{.underline}!

Sean **Lyngaas 6/2**, CNN's cybersecurity reporter, 6/02/2022, "US
confirms military hackers have conducted cyber operations in support of
Ukraine,"
<https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/02/politics/us-hackers-ukraine-support/index.html>,
cc

\"[We\'ve conducted]{.underline} a series of
**[operations]{.underline}** across the full spectrum; offensive,
defensive, \[and\] information operations,\" General Paul Nakasone said
in an interview with Sky News. A spokesperson for [[the
command]{.underline}]{.mark} did not dispute the accuracy of the article
but [**[declined to elaborate]{.mark}** on [what]{.mark} the [command\'s
**operations in Ukraine** have **entailed**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

It\'s a rare public acknowledgment from US military officials of
**[hacking [operations]{.mark}]{.underline}** that
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} often **[[shrouded in
mystery]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Nakasone\'s comments, and the White House\'s response to them, suggest
that cyberspace is a domain in which the Biden administration feels
comfortable countering Russia without fear of escalation. President Joe
Biden has pledged not to engage directly with Russia militarily during
the Ukraine war so long as the US and its allies aren\'t attacked.

Pro-Russia online operatives falsely claimed Zelensky committed suicide
in an effort to sway public opinion, cybersecurity firm says

Pro-Russia online operatives falsely claimed Zelensky committed suicide
in an effort to sway public opinion, cybersecurity firm says

\"We don\'t see it as such,\" White House press secretary Karine
Jean-Pierre said Wednesday when asked at a news conference whether Cyber
Command\'s actions contradicted Biden\'s pledge.

Officials from Biden on down have for months warned about the threat of
retaliatory Russian cyberattacks against US infrastructure after the US
and its allies imposed sweeping sanctions on the Kremlin over its war in
Ukraine.

While analysts have proffered a range of theories, including
improvements in US defenses, for why such a hack hasn\'t apparently
happened yet, US officials tell CNN that Russian fear of escalation in
cyberspace could be one factor.

For one, Moscow may not want to risk retaliatory US cyberattacks that
could hinder Russian military operations, a senior US defense
intelligence official told CNN.

The Russians have already had enough problems in Ukraine executing
military operations, \"I think that adding any kind of potential for US
cyber into that mix \... \[is\] probably factoring into their decision
calculus,\" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity
to speak candidly about a sensitive national security issue.

US and European allies blame Russia for cyberattack on satellite
provider as Ukraine invasion began

The paucity of Russian hacking on US targets may reflect the \"fear of
escalation and what the US response might be, particularly if the US
response affects Russian combat power in some form or fashion,\" the
official added.

The statements, from an interview with a senior official tasked with
keeping a close eye on Russian cyber activity, offer a window into US
thinking on Russian hacking at a critical time in the war \-- as the
Kremlin targets eastern Ukraine after failing to take Kyiv.

The official\'s analysis also reflects the uncertainty and ambiguity of
big-power competition in cyberspace, where governments try to keep each
other guessing on their hacking capabilities and willingness to use
them.

\"For Russia, understanding the full scope of US cyber combat power is a
gap for them which leaves them unsure about opening this front, at least
at this time,\" the senior US official said. \"Cyber warfare is a new
domain \... It hasn\'t been around long enough for any one nation-state
to dominate it.\"

\'Attribution in peacetime is tricky enough\'

Analysts say **[[Cyber Com]{.underline}]{.mark}**mand has matured
considerably since its inception more than a decade ago and has
increasingly become a tool of US power projection. The command sent
personnel to Ukraine in December, in anticipation of the Russian
invasion, to help Kyiv bolster its cyber defenses and to gather
information about potential Russian hacking threats, officials have
said.

There are a range of [[activities]{.mark}, includ]{.underline}ing
[**[low-level]{.mark}** intrusions into **computer networks**, that may
qualify as **\"offensive\" cyber operations** but which the Russians may
not necessarily interpret as **escalatory**]{.underline}, according to
Bobby Chesney, an associate dean at the University of Texas School of
Law who focuses on cyber and national security law.

Some of the command\'s previous hacking operations have included
knocking a Russian troll farm offline during 2018 US midterm elections,
according to a Washington Post report, and targeting ransomware
operatives who threaten US organizations.

While big hacks of US organizations related to the Ukraine war have been
in short supply, a plethora of attempted cyberattacks have been reported
in Ukraine and Russia as digital vigilantes take sides in the war. The
websites of Russian government ministries and media mouthpieces have
been knocked offline or altered to broadcast anti-war slogans.

The senior US defense intelligence official expressed concern that the
Russian government may mistakenly assess that that type of hacking is
coming from the US government.

\"Attribution in peacetime is tricky enough \... I would say [[there\'s
a **real danger** of **unintentionally attributing** something]{.mark}
to **the U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [that the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates or its allies simply **[did not
do]{.underline}**,\" the official said.

Finally, over the summer [we warned about the **twin [risks]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} **mission creep and [prioritization]{.mark}** [against a
backdrop of **finite resources and personnel** to tackle]{.mark}
the]{.underline} diverse and [growing **set of [missions]{.mark}** [that

How **trade-offs** will be made between **new
activities**]{.mark}]{.underline}, like counter-ransomware operations,
and existing missions [remains underspecified]{.underline}. In fact,
this issue was implicit in Nakasone's remarks; at the same time that he
discussed the military's role in ransomware, he also highlighted its
role in election defense and conveyed that Cyber Command was already
preparing to defend the inevitable next round of election interference.
This begs the question: What is being sacrificed or put on the
backburner when the military is used to counter ransomware, and what is
the process that governs decision-making around shifting
prioritizations?

As we argued in our previous post, there is a compelling case for the
military to get involved in counter-ransomware operations that reach the
threshold of significant risk to national security---and we stand by
that argument. However, making this case demands greater transparency
and clarity around how military authorities and resources are utilized,
and how they relate to other governmental authorities and capabilities.
As military cyber operations are possibly ongoing, [as we brace for the
likelihood of **further attacks**, and as the **cyber force** is likely
to grow, **now** is the time to address these concerns]{.underline}.

Besides these characteristics, [[there are]{.mark} some [**constraints**
that impact DOD]{.mark}\'s
**c**]{.underline}ommand-[**and**-**c**]{.underline}ontrol [in
cyberspace. [First]{.mark}]{.underline} of all [is **personnel**. It [is
a]{.mark}]{.underline} relatively [[**small pool** of]{.mark}
**cyber-[experts]{.mark}** [within DOD. So trying to **divide**
those]{.mark} up and **place them all around** the world **dilutes the
pool**, and dilutes **efficiencies**]{.underline}.

Secondly, for the most part, [[personnel is a **zero-sum** game. If you
want]{.mark} to create more [cyber]{.mark} wars, [you\'ve got to **take
it from somewhere else**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We\'re not going to
expect to see an increase in N-strength within DOD, personnel
N-strength, in order to make up a cyber force. [[While DOD may come up
with]{.mark} **some [creative ways]{.mark}**]{.underline} to bring on
some civilians and Reserve Guard capability, **[[there\'s still a
cost]{.underline}]{.mark}** there [that will affect the choice of a
**c**]{.underline}ommand-[**and**-**c**]{.underline}ontrol
**[structure]{.underline}**.

#### Resources are [finite]{.underline}.

Outdated computer and technology systems across DOD and the services
make the military vulnerable to cyberattacks, Rogers said, partly
[[because]{.mark} **defense [acquisition]{.mark}**
[has]{.mark}]{.underline} historically [[prioritized]{.mark} purchasing
**[new]{.mark} weapons [systems]{.mark}**]{.underline}, ships, planes
and other hardware [over shoring up cyber vulnerabilities in existing
systems]{.underline}.

"[[In a world of **finite resources**, you've got to make]{.mark} those
**resource [tradeoffs]{.mark}**]{.underline}," Rogers said, "and in
general, [[the **acquisition world** hasn't]{.underline}]{.mark}
historically [always [been incentivized for]{.mark} **cybersecurity
[outcomes]{.mark}**]{.underline} as its primary metric."

### 2NC\-\--Elections\-\--CYBERCOM Key

#### There are [new measures]{.underline} for security now that restore [public trust]{.underline} in elections.

**CW 22**, CyberWire Magazine, 6/24/2022, "American Data Privacy and
Protection Act. US President signs three cybersecurity bills. US senator
tasks Cybercom with election security reporting. US Navy sets its sights
on cybersecurity.,"
https://thecyberwire.com/newsletters/policy-briefing/4/121, Marsh

[**US [senator]{.mark}** [tasks **Cybercom** with **election
security**]{.mark}]{.underline} reporting.

Maine Senator Angus [King]{.underline} of the US state of Maine [is
**pushing** for a measure that would require]{.underline} US Cyber
Command ([[**Cybercom**) to publish two]{.mark} **unclassified
[reports]{.mark}** [connected with each]{.mark} **biennial
[election]{.mark}**[. The first report would]{.mark} focus on
[assess]{.mark}ing **[foreign threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} before an
election takes place, [[and the second would be a **post-election
assessment**]{.mark} of voting security]{.underline}. King, who is also
Co-chair of Cyberspace Solarium, told the Washington Post, "We want to
be kept informed of what the threats are, how they\'re developing, what
direction they\'re taking. We also want to be able to reassure people
about the security of our elections." Public [[**confidence** in
**election security** has **plummeted**]{.mark} in recent
years]{.underline}, and King asserts that [[having the
**assessment**]{.mark} come [from]{.mark}]{.underline} a trusted,
independent source like **[[Cybercom]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- as well
as making the information as transparent and accessible as possible --
[[could rebuild]{.mark} **Americans' [faith]{.mark}** [in the]{.mark}
**election [process]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To improve the measure's
chance of passage, King included it in the National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA), an annual must-pass defense policy bill that
both Republicans and Democrats already support. 

### 2NC\-\--Elections\-\--Key to Democracy

#### Election [security]{.underline} and its [public trust]{.underline} is the [lifeline]{.underline} of democracy\-\--otherwise, [extinction]{.underline}. 

Jennifer **Panning 21**, Chair of Northwood Board of Trustees, 4/12/21,
"Election Integrity Is an Important Product of the Rule of Law,"
https://www.northwood.edu/afeu/when-free-to-choose/election-integrity-is-an-important-product-of-the-rule-of-law,
\[gendered language edited\], Marsh

[[Rule of law is]{.mark} a **[fundamental]{.mark} component** of The
Northwood Idea. [Society **cannot exist** without it]{.mark}. It is the
wall between **freedom** and **anarchy**]{.underline}.

[[Elections are a part of]{.underline}]{.mark} American [[life]{.mark}
where the rule of law is **especially important**. Many
brave]{.underline} ~~men and women~~ \[[people\] have fought for our
**freedom**, including the **privilege** and **duty** to vote for our
leaders, and we owe it to]{.underline} them to [conduct our
**elections** with high standards of **integrity**. [Democracy is the
greatest form of governance **ever**]{.mark} **devised**]{.underline}, a
system by which free people choose their leaders and hold them
accountable. In other words, a government of, by, and for the people.
[[We might not always be happy]{.mark} with]{.underline} how [our
democracy]{.underline} functions, [[but it beats **any**]{.mark} **and
all [alternatives]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Democracy **only** fulfills its potential when elections are **free**
and **fair**. If the **true will** of the citizenry is not reflected in
**election results**, people will **lose faith** in their
government]{.underline}, and government will not be accountable to the
people. [If that happens, **everyone loses**]{.underline}.

So, everyone should be able to agree on two basic goals of election law:
we want all legal voters to have easy access to voting, but [[we should
make it **more difficult** for]{.mark} **bad [actors to
cheat]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In fact, [[our democracy can be **hamstrung** by]{.mark} nothing more
than [the]{.mark} **widespread [belief]{.mark}** that [elections are
**not free** and **fair**]{.mark}, even if]{.underline} convincing
[evidence of wrongdoing **cannot be produced**]{.underline}. In a system
where cheating is possible, [[the **possibility** of cheating **creates
problems**]{.mark} of its own]{.underline}.

That's why [[it is]{.mark} so **[important]{.mark}** that [we
take]{.mark} **strong**, **decisive** [action to ensure]{.mark} the
**[integrity]{.mark}** of our election process. [Anything short]{.mark}
of that [risks **undermining the democracy**]{.mark} that has been so
[**integral** to America]{.mark}]{.underline}n greatness.

In October 2020, Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton released his latest
book, "A Republic Under Assault," raising serious allegations of
widespread campaigns to change electoral laws in ways that make voter
fraud more likely. Less than a month later, [the 2020]{.underline}
General [Election became one of the **most contentious** in history,
with]{.underline} significant [segments of society **stubbornly
unconvinced** that the]{.underline} official [results **accurately
reflected** the]{.underline} true [will of the people]{.underline}.
Again, **[this is a bad]{.underline}** outcome for everyone.

the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and elsewhere if
big business can be seduced by promises of riches in return for the

right to leave [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} dark
[[world]{.underline}]{.mark} out, for it [[would be very dark:
**nationalist wars** with risks of **escalation** into **global nuclear
conflict**]{.mark}, further [**digital militarization** (even
**Terminator-style**]{.mark} **scenarios of smart [military

disasters**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Shoring up democracy solves every impact

Dr. Joseph S. **Nye 17**, University Distinguished Service Professor at
the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, January/February 2017, "Will
the Liberal Order Survive?," Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/system/files/pdf/anthologies/2017/b0033_0.pdf

[The order will inevitably look]{.underline} somewhat
[different]{.underline} as the twenty-first century progresses. China,
India, and other economies will continue to grow, and the U.S. share of
the world economy will drop. [But [no]{.mark} other
[country]{.mark}]{.underline}, including China, [[is poised to displace
the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[from its dominant position]{.underline}. Even so, the order may still
be threatened by a general diffusion of power away from governments
toward nonstate actors. [[The info]{.mark}rmation [revolution is
putting]{.mark}]{.underline} a number of [transnational issues, such as
[**financial stability**, **climate change**, **terrorism**,
**pandemics**]{.mark}, and [**cybersecurity**, on the global
agenda]{.mark} at the same time]{.underline} as [it is weakening the
ability of all governments to respond]{.underline}.¶ [Complexity is
growing]{.underline}, and world politics will soon not be the sole
province of governments. Individuals and private organizations---from
corporations and nongovernmental organizations to terrorists and social
movements---are being empowered, and informal networks will undercut the
monopoly on power of traditional bureaucracies. Governments will
continue to possess power and resources, but the stage on which they
play will become ever more crowded, and they will have less ability to
direct the action.¶ Even if [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates remains the largest power,
accordingly, it [[will not]{.mark} be able to
[achieve]{.mark}]{.underline} many of its [international [goals]{.mark}
acting [alone]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, [**international
[financial stability]{.mark}** is vital]{.underline} to the prosperity
of Americans, [but the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[[needs]{.mark} the [cooperation]{.mark} of others to ensure
it]{.underline}. Global **[[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
rising sea levels will affect the quality of life, but [Americans
[cannot manage]{.mark}]{.underline} these problems [[by
themselves]{.underline}]{.mark}. And in a world [where [borders
are]{.mark}]{.underline} becoming more porous, [[letting
in]{.underline}]{.mark} everything from [**[drugs]{.mark} to infectious
[diseases]{.mark} to [terrorism]{.mark}**[, nations
must]{.mark}]{.underline} use soft power to [develop networks and [build
institutions]{.mark} to address shared threats and
challenges]{.underline}.¶ China is unlikely to surpass the United States
in power anytime soon.¶ Washington can provide some important global
public goods largely by itself. The U.S. Navy is crucial when it comes
to policing the law of the seas and defending freedom of navigation, and
the U.S. Federal Reserve undergirds international financial stability by
serving as a lender of last resort. On the new transnational issues,
however, success will require the cooperation of others---and thus
empowering others can help the United States accomplish its own goals.
In this sense, power becomes a positive-sum game: one needs to think of
not just the United States' power over others but also the power to
solve problems that the United States can acquire by working with
others. In such a world, the ability to connect with others becomes a
major source of power, and here, too, the United States leads the pack.
The United States comes first in the Lowy Institute's ranking of nations
by number of embassies, consulates, and missions. It has some 60 treaty
allies, and The Economist estimates that nearly 100 of the 150 largest
countries lean toward it, while only 21 lean against it.¶ [Increasingly,
however]{.underline}, the [[openness that enables the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[to]{.mark} build networks, [maintain institutions]{.mark}, and sustain
alliances [is]{.mark}]{.underline} itself **[[under
siege]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is why [[the **most important
challenge** to]{.mark} the provision of [world
order]{.mark}]{.underline} in the twenty-first century
[[comes]{.underline}]{.mark} not from without but **[[from
within]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Democratic governance prevents [multiple scenarios]{.underline} for extinction\-\--apprehension creates openings for Russia and China to embed and authoritarian order, causing [nuclear war]{.underline}

The Rise of a Global Society

Let me first sketch the global democratic project for global governance
as a point of reference. We must first recognize that globalization has
given rise to a global society [for the **first time** in]{.underline}
the [evolution of the]{.underline} human [**species**. We
are]{.underline} now [**stuck with each other**; **[seven and half
billion]{.mark}** people today ---]{.underline} nine to [[**ten**
by]{.mark} **20[50]{.mark}**:]{.underline} all [**super connected** and
**interdependent**. In greater or lesser measure, humans [are]{.mark}
mutually [dependent]{.mark}]{.underline} on each other in the pursuit of
their most salient values, interests, needs, and preferences ---
[[concerns]{.underline} [about]{.underline}]{.mark} personal, community,
and national **[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[sustainable]{.underline} economic **[[growth]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
protection of [the **[environment]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the [equitable
**[distribution]{.mark}** of]{.underline} the globe's material [wealth,
human **[rights]{.mark}**, and]{.underline} even the [validation
of]{.underline} their personal and social [identities]{.underline} by
others. Global [[**warming** is a metaphor]{.mark} of this morphological
social change]{.underline} in the human condition. [**[All]{.mark}**
humans [are **implicated** in]{.mark} this looming]{.underline}
Anthropogenic-induced **[[disaster]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- the
exhausts of billions of automobiles, the methane released in fracking
for natural gas, outdated U.S. coal-fired power plants and newly
constructed ones in China. Even the poor farmer burning charcoal to warm
his dinner is complicit.

Since interdependence surrounds, ensnares, and binds us as a human
society, the dilemma confronting the world's diverse and divided
populations is evident: the expanding scope as well as the deepening,
accumulating, and thickening interdependencies of globalization urge
global government. But the Kantian ideal of universal governance is
beyond the reach of the world's disparate peoples. They are profoundly
divided by religion, culture, language, tribal, ethnic and national
loyalties as well as by class, social status, race, gender, and sexual
orientation. How have the democracies responded to this dilemma? How
have they attempted to reconcile the growing interdependence of the
world's disputing peoples and need for global governance?

What do we mean by the governance of a human society?

A working, legitimate government of a human society requires
simultaneous responses to three competing imperatives: Order, Welfare,
and Legitimacy. While the forms of these OWL imperatives have differed
radically over the course of human societal evolution, these constraints
remain predicable of all human societies if they are to replicate
themselves and flourish over time. The OWL imperatives are no less
applicable to a global society.

1\. Order refers to a society's investment of awesome material power in
an individual or body to arbitrate and resolve value, interest, and
preference conflicts, which cannot be otherwise resolved by non-violent
means --- the Hobbesian problematic.

2\. The Welfare imperative refers to the necessity of humans to eat,
drink, clothe, and shelter themselves and to pursue the full-range of
their seemingly limitless acquisitive appetites. Responses to the
Welfare imperative, like that of Order, constitute a distinct form of
governing power and authority with its own decisional processes and
actors principally associated either with the Welfare or the Order
imperative. Hence we have the Marxian-Adam Smith problematic.

3\. Legitimacy is no less a form of governing power and authority,
independent of the Order and Welfare imperatives. Either by choice,
socialization, or coerced acquiescence, populations acknowledge a
regime's governing authority and their obligation to submit to its rule.
Here arises the Rousseaunian problematic.

The government of a human society emerges then as an evolving,
precarious balance and compromise of the ceaseless struggle of these
competing OWL power domains for ascendancy of one of these imperatives
over the others. It is against the backdrop of these OWL imperatives ---
Order, Welfare, and Legitimacy --- that we are brought to the democratic
project for global governance.

The Democratic Project

For Order, open societies constructed the global democratic state and,
in alliance, the democratic global-state system. Collectively these
initiatives led to the creation of the United Nations, the World Bank,
the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, and the
European Union to implement the democratic project's system of global
governance.

The democratic global state assumed all of the functions of the
Hobbesian Westphalian security state --- but a lot more. The global
state became a Trading, Banking, Market, and Entrepreneurial state. To
these functions were added those of the Science, Technology and the
Economic Growth state. How else would we be able to enjoy the Internet,
cell phones and iPhones, or miracle cures? These are the products of the
iron triangle of the global democratic state, academic and non-profit
research centers, and corporations. It is a myth that the Market System
did all this alone. Fueled by increasing material wealth, the democratic
global state was afforded the means to become the Safety Net state,
providing education, health, social security, leisure and recreation for
its population. And as the global state's power expanded across this
broad and enlarging spectrum of functions and roles, the global state
was also constrained by the social compacts of the democracies to be
bound by popular rule. The ironic result of the expansion of the global
state's power and social functions and its obligation to accede to
popular will was a Security state and global state-system that vastly
outperformed its principal authoritarian rivals in the Cold War. So much
briefly is the democratic project's response to the Order imperative.

Now let's look at the democratic project's response to the Welfare
imperative. The democracies institutionalized Adam Smith's vision of a
global Market System. The Market System trucks and barters, Smith's
understanding of what it means to be human. But it does a lot more. The
Market System facilitates and fosters the free movement of people, goods
and services, capital, ideas, values, scientific discoveries, and best
technological practices. Created is a vibrant global civil society
oblivious to state boundaries. What we now experience is De
Tocqueville's Democracy in America on global steroids.

As for the imperative of Legitimacy, the social compacts of the
democracies affirmed Rousseau's conjecture that all humans are free and
therefore equal. Applied to elections each citizen has one vote.
[Democratic [regimes]{.mark}]{.underline} are also obliged to submit to
the rule of law, to conduct free and fair elections, to honor majority
rule while protecting minority rights, and to [**[promote]{.mark}**
human [rights]{.mark}]{.underline} at home and
[**[abroad]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The Authoritarian Threat to the Democratic Project

[The **democratic project** for **global [governance]{.mark}**
[is]{.mark} now [at **risk**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Let's start with the
challenges posed by authoritarian regimes, with Russia and China in the
lead. Both [[Russia and China would **rest global governance**]{.mark}
on Big Power spheres of influence. Both]{.underline} would
[[assume]{.underline} **[hegemonic status]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in
their]{.underline} respective [regions, [asserting]{.mark}
their]{.underline} [versions of the **Monroe Doctrine**.]{.underline}
Their [[regional hegemony]{.mark} would]{.underline} then
**[leverage]{.underline}** [their claim to be global **Big
Powers**.]{.underline} Moscow and Beijing would then have an equal say
with the United States and the West in sharing and shaping global
governance. [[The]{.mark} Russo-Chinese global
[system]{.mark}]{.underline} of Order [[would
ascribe]{.underline}]{.mark} to Russia and China governing privileges
not accorded to the states both aspire to dominate. [Moscow and
Beijing]{.underline} would enjoy [**unconditional** recognition
of]{.underline} their state **[sovereignty]{.underline}**, territorial
integrity, and non-interference in their domestic affairs,
[but]{.underline} [they would]{.underline} reserve to themselves the
right to [**intervene** in]{.underline} the domestic and foreign affairs
of the [states]{.underline} and peoples under their tutelage [in pursuit
of]{.underline} their [hegemonic interests.]{.underline} President
[Putin]{.underline} has [announced]{.underline} that [Russia's
**imperialism** encompasses]{.underline} the **[millions]{.underline}**
of Russians [living in the]{.underline} [former]{.underline} republics
of the [Soviet Union.]{.underline} Russia contends that Ukraine and
Belarus also fall under Moscow's purported claim to historical
sovereignty over these states. [Forceful re-absorption of **Crimea** and
control over eastern **Ukraine**]{.underline} [are viewed
by]{.underline} President [Putin as Russia's historical
inheritances.]{.underline} Self-determination is not extended to these
states or to other states and peoples of the former Soviet Union. Moscow
rejects their right to freely align, say, with the European Union or,
god forbid, with NATO.

In contrast to the democratic project, universal in its reach, [the
[Russo-Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline} conception of a stable [global
[order rests on]{.mark}]{.underline} more
**[[tenuous]{.underline}]{.mark}** and [[**conflict-prone**
**ethno-national foundations**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Russia's proclaimed
enemies are the United States and the European Union. Any means that
undermines the unity of these entities is viewed by Moscow as a gain.
[[The endgame]{.mark} is [a **poly-anarchical**]{.mark} interstate
system,]{.underline} potentially [[as **war-prone** as]{.mark} the
Eurocentric system **[before]{.mark}** and **after [World War
I]{.mark}**[, but]{.mark}]{.underline} now [populated by states [with

How [**[Cyberspace]{.mark}** Is [Creating **Nuclear
Risks**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Policymakers and academics are attuned to the cyber risks to nuclear
command and control. The practitioner community has largely focused on
U.S. vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them. Scholars, in turn, worry
about how cyber operations could have unintended escalatory
consequences. But less attention has been paid to another likely
scenario: the use of cyber operations for signaling purposes (operations
with visible effects that aim to convey a message to another state) in a
nuclear context. The ambiguity of cyber operations can sometimes be
useful for signaling --- but the same ambiguity can be dangerous during
a nuclear crisis. The problem is that civilian leaders in particular,
distinct from the military, are inclined to see cyber attacks as
effective signaling tools.

Cyber operations could have nuclear implications, especially because
[**modern** nuclear [c]{.mark}ommand [and c]{.mark}ontrol
**systems**]{.underline}, like those [in]{.underline} Russia and [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [[are]{.mark} becoming
**increasingly [dependent]{.mark}** [on **digital
infrastructure**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nuclear command, control, and
communications systems, which include [early warning,
info]{.underline}rmation [collection, and communications]{.underline}
capabilities, alert decision-makers to impending nuclear strikes and
also enable leaders to control decisions about nuclear use (or non-use).
But their [digital [dependencies]{.mark} are [creat]{.mark}ing
[**opportunities** for **exploitation**]{.mark} using **cyber
means**]{.underline}. In a 2020 report, the Nuclear Threat Initiative
found that "almost [**9 out of 10** planned **nuclear modernization
programs** involve]{.underline} at least some new [digital
components]{.underline} or upgrades."

Vulnerabilities inherent in the digital infrastructure that undergird
modern nuclear systems provide opportunities for actors to engage in
cyber espionage --- gaining access to a network or system to steal
information --- or even conduct cyber attacks. Hypothetically, a cyber
power like Russia could conduct a cyber attack against a U.S. early
warning satellite to degrade its functionality. This has become an
urgent concern for practitioners. U.S. Strategic Command, for instance,
is currently working to "operationally harden NC3 systems against cyber
threats." Congress has also gotten involved, requiring the Defense
Department to evaluate the cybersecurity of major weapon systems. And
the Government Accountability Office has published multiple reports
decrying the state of cybersecurity and scope of vulnerabilities of
weapon systems, including elements of the nuclear triad.

From an academic perspective, scholars have investigated how cyber
operations targeting nuclear systems could exacerbate escalation risks.
Focusing on nuclear forces, [**early** research]{.underline}, such as
work by Martin Libicki, [was **skeptical of the dangers**]{.underline}
posed by cyber operations. [**Nuclear forces** were seen as]{.underline}
being largely immune from digital attacks because they were "**[air
gapped]{.underline}**," meaning that they were separated from
information technology systems.

[However]{.underline}, as [**nuclear [systems]{.mark}** [have
become]{.mark} **increasingly [intertwined]{.mark}** with the **digital
environment**]{.underline} --- not to mention the dual-use nature of
many elements of nuclear command, control, and communications systems
(like early warning or position, navigation, and timing satellites) ---
the protection offered by being segregated from the internet is less
robust. Jacquelyn Schneider, Benjamin Schechter, and Rachael Schaffer,
for instance, ran a series of wargames demonstrating that
**[[decision-makers]{.underline}]{.mark}** in hypothetical crises [are
**likely** to [use]{.mark} their [**cyber exploits** against an
adversary's]{.mark} **nuclear [systems]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They
found that this could have negative effects on states' respective
nuclear strategies, especially decisions to pre-delegate nuclear launch
authority or automate nuclear responses. Erik Gartzke and Jon Lindsay
argue that the clandestine nature of cyber operations means that [one
state could **secretly gain access**]{.underline} to an adversary's
[nuclear]{.underline} command, control, and communications
[systems]{.underline}, giving the former an information advantage or
even [[creating]{.mark} an [incentive]{.mark}]{.underline} for the
latter [[to **use**]{.mark} **its [nuclear weapons]{.mark}** out of the
fear that it may **lose them**]{.underline}. James Acton notes that the
difficulties of distinguishing between cyber espionage and attack could
lead a state to misperceive the intent behind a cyber operation,
generating a similar "use it or lose it" calculus.

The most obvious [implication for **national security** is that more
could be done to reduce America's]{.underline} significant [**cyber
vulnerabilities**. [Defense through offense]{.mark}]{.underline} may be
a promising experiment or operational concept, but it [may [not]{.mark}
be **[fully developed]{.mark}** as a strategy. The
government]{.underline}, both the executive and legislative branches,
[must work to **rebalance** these efforts with]{.underline}
significantly [**more funding** for federal
**cybersecurity**]{.underline}, critical infrastructure, information
sharing [and]{.underline} a wide range of other [defensive
priorities]{.underline}.

The Cyberspace Solarium Commission noted that within the Homeland
Security budget, only 15 percent is "committed to initiatives supporting
the private sector." Overall, that is perhaps 1 percent of Defense
Department funding. This percentage must increase many times over,
targeted at embracing those innovations that give defenders the greatest
advantages over attackers at the greatest scale and least cost; working
toward major political goals, such as getting to zero botnets; creating
new organizations to directly collaborate on response and not just share
information; and countless other critical civilian cyber tasks. The U.S.
strategy should place non-state actors, with their unique agility and
capabilities, at the center of defense and help fund them accordingly.

Just as serious is the misconception in U.S. strategic thinking that
sees U.S. moves as beneficial and stabilizing but our adversaries' as
dangerous militarizing escalations. Brazen, reckless attacks like
WannaCry and NotPetya are destabilizing and nothing like more precise
U.S. operations. We must recognize that adversaries are responding in
part to U.S. actions---like Stuxnet and those revealed by
Snowden---and perceived U.S. actions---such as Russian President
Vladimir Putin's belief that the Panama Papers were a U.S. covert action
aimed at him.

While the budget comparisons I have presented may come as a surprise to
some Lawfare readers, they will not surprise most U.S. adversaries, who
have long feared U.S. cyber power. Recognizing the true U.S. priorities
may help us recognize a more balanced perspective.

Moreover, as I wrote on Lawfare last year, there are tremendous risks
when a "fearsome offense \[is\] paired with a weak defense." If
adversaries feel a war with the United States may be coming, our having
"a more fearsome cyber offense makes it more likely they will \[get in a
sucker punch\] on the U.S. before Cyber Command can bring its big guns
to bear."

[While [the]{.mark} Defense [Department needs]{.mark} **significant
[funding]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}]{.underline} its essential [**cyber

[[Taiwan's defense has]{.mark} always [been **precarious**, and the
dangers are only]{.mark} likely [to **grow** as]{.mark} [**China's
power** increases]{.mark}]{.underline}.1 Chinese economic inducement
since the 1990s has done little to persuade Taiwan's citizens to embrace
China's vision of a "one country, two system" model for cross-strait
relations, prospects that are even lower with China's recent steps to
erode political freedoms in Hong Kong. To deter Taiwan independence and
to pressure Taiwan's leaders to accept Beijing's proposals, China's
People's Liberation Army (PLA) has amassed significant forces across the
Taiwan Strait, including more than 600 short-range ballistic missiles
opposite the island.2 Taiwan's will to resist Chinese pressure depends,
in part, on the speed and efficacy of U.S. intervention in a conflict.
China's military has thus built an arsenal of long-range missiles and
supporting capabilities to try to keep the United States out of the
fight.

China's basic advantages in any Taiwan scenario include a high level of
political will---[[reunification is a **"core interest"**]{.mark} for
the **Chinese Communist Party**]{.underline} (CCP), which aspires to
resolve the problem on its own terms by the centennial of the People's
Republic of China in 2049---and a local military balance that pits a
regional heavyweight against a small island with few diplomatic allies
and limited resources. Taiwan's proximity to the mainland and the
"tyranny of distance" facing an attempt to surge U.S. forces across the
Western Pacific are liabilities for the defense.

Much can still be done to address the threat head-on, but a prudent U.S.
approach should also consider ways of shifting the competition to areas
where China is at a disadvantage. Multiple pressures on the PLA, driven
by China's unfavorable geostrategic environment, provide the basis for a
competitive strategy. In peacetime, the United States should create
headaches for the PLA in other areas bordering China by increasing
military assistance and training to China's other rivals. This approach
would leverage the demand that many states have for better capabilities
to resist Chinese coercion and play to preexisting Chinese concerns
about threats suddenly appearing in secondary theaters. A PLA that is
simultaneously having to counter many different challenges will be less
able to focus on Taiwan.

Looking at Taiwan's defense through a competitive strategy lens also
suggests different options for confronting the PLA in wartime. China's
military structure is built on the notion that the PLA must be prepared
to fight in many theaters at once. By necessity, it contains a
centralized command and control and logistics system designed to manage
and reallocate forces in a war. Targeting those critical links would
complicate Chinese decisionmaking, reduce the PLA's capacity to mass
forces, and support U.S. and Taiwan operations in the main theater. To
limit escalation risks, those operations should rely, wherever possible,
on nonkinetic means. [Ensuring **[Taiwan's
defense]{.mark}**]{.underline} is no easy feat but [[will be easier with
op]{.mark}eration[s that **defray** China's]{.mark} **local
[advantages]{.mark}**]{.underline} and keep the PLA off balance.

A New Lens for an Old Problem

Most discussions on improving Taiwan's defenses focus on two issues.
First is modernizing Taiwan's military and equipping it with the means
of resisting Chinese aggression. This is the subject of Taiwan's
"overall defense concept," which focuses on asymmetric weapons such as
sea mines and coastal defense cruise missiles needed to blunt an
invasion.3 Taiwan's limited ability to weather a Chinese offensive even
with advanced equipment has led to a second focus: preserving a credible
U.S. intervention capability so that the United States would be able to
meet its obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act to "maintain the
capacity" to resist China's use of force (acknowledging that any
military intervention would ultimately be a political decision).4 In
recent years, all the services have rolled out revised operational
concepts designed to allow U.S. forces to operate within China's
antiaccess/area-denial envelope, such as using stealthier ships more,
reducing reliance on large bases, operating more from austere airstrips,
and exploiting long-duration unmanned technology.

Both approaches are helpful in instilling doubt in the Chinese
leadership about the PLA's prospects in an amphibious invasion.
Nevertheless, a problem for the defense is that China has built large
advantages in most categories of conventional power across the Taiwan
Strait---in submarines, for instance, the ratio is 34 Chinese submarines
assigned to the relevant theaters versus 2 for Taiwan---forcing Taipei
to rely on U.S. intervention to ensure its ability to resist a blockade
and successive waves of amphibious and airborne assaults. Yet this is a
gamble, if one credits reports that wargames consistently show U.S.
forces losing to China, due in part to China's impressive
counter-intervention capabilities and in part to the vast distances that
U.S. forces need to traverse. Some concepts of intervention also
envision extensive strikes on the mainland, which would carry a high
risk of retributive Chinese strikes on U.S. targets, such as military
bases in Japan or Guam.5

Given those limitations, more thought is needed on how to move the
competition to different playing fields where China has fewer advantages
(reflecting the logic of the "competitive strategies" approach pioneered
by Andrew Marshall in the early 1970s).6 Adopting this philosophy, the
2018 National Defense Strategy encourages U.S. policies that "expand the
competitive space, seizing the initiative to challenge our competitors
where we possess advantages and they lack strength."7 U.S. doctrine has
emphasized a related point: that adversary decisionmaking should be
complicated by presenting it with "multiple dilemmas," overwhelming its
capacity to reach timely decisions on the use of force.8 Both tenets
encourage U.S. strategists to think creatively about our adversary's
constraints while taking a more holistic view of our own comparative
strengths.

The PLA's Fundamental Dilemma

The basis of a competitive strategy is the tension in Chinese military
strategy between preparing for a war with Taiwan and fulfilling the
dizzying array of other requirements with finite resources.9 A war with
Taiwan has been the PLA's top planning scenario since the early 1990s.
The rise of a new generation of Kuomintang leaders who had less interest
in a political union with the mainland, combined with a Taiwan
electorate largely opposed to unification, meant that the PLA needed to
prepare to seize and occupy the island. This led to investments in
short-range ballistic missiles, submarines, and amphibious capabilities,
as well as training in what used to be called the Nanjing Military
Region, recently rebranded as the Eastern Theater Command, focused on
capturing offshore islands. The possibility of U.S. intervention,
underscored by the involvement of two U.S. aircraft carriers in the
1995--1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, sparked an emphasis on developing
long-range antiship missiles and other capabilities to forestall U.S.
intervention in a conflict.

The PLA could not, however, fully commit to preparations for a war with
Taiwan and the United States. The crux of the problem is a highly
unfavorable geostrategic environment. Within China itself, the western
third of the country is occupied by ethnic Uighurs and Tibetans who have
their own dreams of independence. Regionally, China shares land borders
with 14 countries and maritime borders with an additional 7, including
states that are either unstable, such as North Korea and Afghanistan, or
that have territorial disputes with China, including Japan, India, the
Philippines, and Vietnam.10 Defending China's long borders and
dissuading other countries from asserting their sovereignty claims put
competing demands on China's finite military resources. U.S. military
presence and the specter of U.S. involvement in conflicts ranging from
Korea to the South China Sea also mean that the PLA must prepare for
high-end conflicts outside the Taiwan Strait.

An additional problem, from the PLA's perspective, is the fear that
China's rivals---both within the region and domestic forces opposed to
Chinese Communist Party rule---could take advantage of a war with Taiwan
to challenge the regime or seize Chinese territory. Chinese strategists
write of the possibility of a "chain reaction" of wars cascading across
China's frontiers. Such concerns are not new. Mao himself reputedly
warned the PLA not to overlook problems outside the main theater.
Indeed, Chinese historians note that none of the wars that China fought
during the Cold War was in an area then designated as the "main
strategic direction."11 In the PLA's jargon, the military should not
overemphasize the main strategic direction (the southeast coast; and the
Taiwan Strait, in particular); it also needs to prepare for combat in
other theaters.12

Combined, these competing concerns mean that the PLA has needed to
generate capabilities less relevant to island landings, widely disperse
its resources across the country (including allocating advanced fighters
and other modern capabilities to other regions), balance the three naval
fleets, and develop plans and train for a variety of contingencies.13
The theater command system itself, as noted below, is optimized for
smaller border clashes and not a single major conflict of the sort that
would be prosecuted on Taiwan. Compounding the problem is the PLA's
personnel system in which officers spend most of their careers in a
single theater and are thus less fungible across different contingencies
than, for instance, their American peers who frequently rotate to new
assignments.

The June 2020 escalation with Indian troops along the disputed Himalayan
border illustrates the countervailing pressures on PLA resources and
attention.14 The area is what the PLA refers to as a "secondary
strategic direction," where the threats facing China are less intense
than in the main strategic direction, but still require significant
forces to deter or defeat a rival. To counter India and perform other
missions such as defending China's Central Asian borders and deterring
uprisings in ethnic majority regions, the PLA has allocated roughly a
quarter of its ground forces to the Western Theater Command and the
Tibet and Xinjiang military districts, complemented by eight
fighter/ground attack brigades and four missile brigades.15 These forces
train for missions such as counterterrorism and high-altitude warfare
and against the capabilities of particular adversaries that have little
bearing on the operations China would conduct in a war with Taiwan.

Concerns about flare-ups in other regions and a broad distribution of
capabilities have not prevented the military balance across the strait
from shifting gradually in China's favor. PLA capabilities have
regularly been used to intimidate Taiwan's leaders---for instance, by a
steady rhythm of H-6 bomber flights around the island---and are
sufficient for a range of cross-strait operations, including missile
bombardments and a blockade.16 Moreover, there are some circumstances in
which Beijing might accept a high degree of risk to its other interests
to launch a war against Taiwan. For instance, a Taiwanese declaration of
independence could generate a high degree of domestic pressure on the
CCP to act. However, Taiwanese leaders have been careful to avoid such
provocations, meaning that the likeliest scenario for China would be a
calculated war of choice.17 Yet competing considerations reduce China's
ability to mass its forces in wartime and make the task of Taiwan's
defense more manageable for Taipei and Washington.

A Chain of Porcupines

China's force planning dilemma provides options for thinking differently
about Taiwan's defense prior to and during a conflict initiated by
Beijing. Applying a competitive strategies approach, [**[U.S.]{.mark}
defense [strategy]{.mark}** in peacetime [should]{.mark}]{.underline}
aim to [[reduce China's]{.mark} [ability to **focus** on Taiwan by
maximizing]{.mark} the]{.underline} range and complexity of
[[challenges]{.mark} facing the PLA]{.underline} in other theaters. This
requires, in part, that the United States maintain a strong presence at
many points along China's periphery, voice support for the defense of
allies, and conduct high-end exercises with China's other rivals. Such
activities, which are central to the current Indo-Pacific strategy, play
into Chinese concerns about encirclement and add to the pressure to
divide up resources among many theaters.18

Expanding security cooperation with other states would enhance those
effects. Using Michael Beckley's twist of a phrase coined by William S.
Murray, an explicit goal of U.S. strategy should be to ring China with
"prickly porcupines" by supplying other states with the military tools
necessary to resist coercion.19 Providing additional training and
advanced weapons and equipment, like antiship missiles, to states such
as Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia, would serve their
interests in maintaining sovereignty while also ramping up the
challenges the PLA Navy, Marines, and Air Force would have to counter
outside the Taiwan Strait. By pursuing their own ends, these countries
could indirectly contribute to Taiwan's defense without requiring them
to be actively involved in cross-strait affairs.

From this perspective, expanded security cooperation with states far
from China's southeast coast is particularly useful. India is a prime
example. Upgrading defense ties with New Delhi has been a goal of the
last few U.S. administrations, pursued most recently through renewed
efforts to expand defense industry cooperation; approval of \$3 billion
in arms sales, including high-end items like air defense radars, MK 54
torpedoes, and Harpoon missiles; an agreement on the sharing of military
intelligence; and combat-focused exercises in the Indian Ocean featuring
India and Japan. Further arms sales and other assistance would not only
serve India's interest in countering Chinese coercion, which has been
piqued because of the 2020 border crisis, but also draw PLA resources
away from the Taiwan Strait.

As Andrew Marshall explained regarding the Soviet Union, competitive
strategies should also leverage bureaucratic fissures in the target
country. Relevant here are China's tendency to carve up the budgetary
pie with as many "winners" as possible, contestation between different
parts of the PLA for scarce resources, and the lack of a strong central
mechanism to adjudicate bureaucratic disputes. Increasing threats from
smaller rivals in the South China Sea would not only take up time and
capacity for the Southern Theater Command but also provide an argument
for that theater to demand resources, which might otherwise go to the
Eastern Theater Command. Deepening defense cooperation with India, for
instance, would serve as a powerful rationale for the Western Theater
Command to argue for more resources.

Selling more advanced arms to China's other neighbors in a bid to take
pressure off Taiwan would probably not dissuade China from using
force---any decision to use force assumes a high risk and cost tolerance
and would be undertaken only in exigent circumstances. But it does
encourage the PLA to spread out its limited resources, which ultimately
works in favor of Taiwan's defense.

U.S. strategy could also try to move the competition in new directions
during a conflict. Such moves are typically discussed under the label of
"horizontal escalation," involving attacks on an adversary's interests
in a secondary theater.20 [In a Taiwan scenario]{.underline}, it is
tempting to imagine U.S. forces leveraging their maneuverability to pose
problems that tie up PLA resources elsewhere. However, [opening a
**second front** would be **difficult**]{.underline} because of the near
certainty that India or other countries in the region would stay out of
the conflict and the likelihood that U.S. leaders, attuned to the costs
of a wider regional conflagration, would also try to avoid a larger war.
As the congressionally mandated National Defense Strategy Commission
argued, "It is unlikely that the United States could force its adversary
to back down by applying pressure---military or otherwise---in secondary
areas."21

[In an indirect way]{.underline}, however, [[China's]{.mark}
**geostrategic [circumstances]{.mark}** [give]{.mark} the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates additional
[**warfighting [options]{.mark}** [that do not rely on
**kinetic**]{.mark} **strike[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} or futile
diversions. The starting point is that the PLA has adopted an
organizational structure attuned to many small conflicts, and not to a
single large contingency. This preference for smaller contingencies is
reflected in the PLA's theater command system (which replaced the former
military regions as part of the broad restructuring of the military that
began in late 2015).22 The Eastern Theater Command lacks all the
capabilities that would be necessary to execute a war: amphibious and
airborne units are based in adjacent theaters and space and cyber assets
are under the Strategic Support Force. Countering U.S. intervention
would require long-range missiles that are likely under the direct
control of the Central Military Commission. In addition to mobilizing
reinforcements, frontline commanders may have to request ammunition and
equipment based in other theaters if major losses are sustained at the
war's outset.

[The limitations of [China's]{.mark}]{.underline} theater
[**[command]{.mark} structure** [mean the war would be
**centrally**]{.mark} **managed**]{.underline}, most likely by the Joint
Staff Department [[in **Beijing**]{.mark}. Logistics operations would
rely on a]{.underline} distributed [network of depots]{.underline}
controlled by the Joint Logistic Support Force [in Wuhan]{.underline}.23
Then, rather than focusing mainly on the Taiwan Strait, [**[U.S.
op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}** [should]{.mark}]{.underline} try to
[[sever]{.mark} the]{.underline} command and control and
[**[logistics]{.mark} networks** critical to Beijing's]{.underline}
ability to manage the [war]{.underline} (while preserving critical U.S.
networks that would be targeted by the PLA). [Such operations would
leverage]{.underline} what one RAND study deems potential [**Chinese
weaknesses** [in **cyber**]{.mark} **defense**]{.underline},24 and may
benefit from recent investments, such as the U.S. Army's creation of
information operations detachments within its multidomain task force
concept, which include both cyber and electronic warfare capabilities.25
Even if the PLA is able to reconstitute those systems, [the disruption
could frustrate China's **decisionmaking process** and buy **valuable
time** for U.S. forces]{.underline} to intervene, [without the need for
kinetic strikes]{.underline}. An added virtue is that this approach
exploits a PLA organizational culture that emphasizes centralization, in
contrast to the U.S. "mission command" philosophy of empowering
commanders to implement approved policy aims without precise direction
and intensive management oversight.

Generating [[those]{.mark} effects [would also benefit from
**info**]{.mark}**rmation [op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}** [that]{.mark}
try to **exploit**]{.underline} cleavages in [Chinese
**c**ivil-**m**ilitary **r**elations]{.underline}. During a conflict,
the PLA would likely argue that it is fully capable of managing the
conflict while adequately defending China's security in secondary
theaters. However, civilian leaders, prone to years of PLA dissembling
and obfuscation, would approach those assurances with at least some
skepticism.26 [Info]{.underline}rmation [op]{.underline}eration[s that
[raise questions about the PLA's competence]{.mark}]{.underline}---such
as misinformation suggesting that key systems may not be completely
reliable---[would]{.underline} exacerbate those doubts and potentially
[lead to **additional delays**]{.underline} as problems are
investigated. This would create new opportunities for U.S. forces to
seize the initiative and sustain a higher decision tempo than PLA
leadership can operate within.

Conclusion

Taiwan benefits from regional disturbances, such as the recent clash
with India, in direct and indirect ways. The possibility of a conflict
with other rivals forces China's constrained resources to be broadly
dispersed and its troops trained and equipped for diverse scenarios.
Such contingencies have also produced a theater structure not well
suited to a war. These are systemic weaknesses for the PLA that could be
leveraged to shift the competition to areas beyond the Taiwan Strait,
rendering the task of countering Chinese operations in the main theater
more manageable. Playing to existing concerns among Chinese strategists,
U.S. alliances could be deepened to overextend PLA assets, while
critical links in the PLA's command structure could be targeted in a
conflict to reduce its capacity to mass force. [[Success depends

Russia's invasion of [**Ukraine** has raised the **specter of nuclear
war**]{.underline}, as Russian President Vladimir Putin has placed his
nuclear forces at an elevated state of alert and has warned that any
effort by outside parties to interfere in the war would result in
"consequences you have never seen." Such saber-rattling has
understandably made headlines and drawn notice in Washington. [But [if
China attempted to]{.mark} **forcibly [invade]{.mark}** [Taiwan]{.mark}
and the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [came to
Taipei's aid, the **threat of escalation** could outstrip]{.underline}
even [the]{.underline} current nerve-wracking [situation in
Europe]{.underline}.

A recent war game, conducted by the Center for a New American Security
in conjunction with the NBC program "Meet the Press," demonstrated just
how quickly such a conflict could escalate. The game posited a fictional
crisis set in 2027, with the aim of examining how the United States and
China might act under a certain set of conditions. The game demonstrated
that [China's **military modernization** and **expansion of its nuclear
arsenal**---not to mention the importance Beijing places on
**unification with Taiwan**---mean]{.underline} that, in the real world,
[[a fight]{.mark} between China and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates could very well [[go
**nuclear**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Beijing views Taiwan as a breakaway republic. [[If the
**C**]{.underline}]{.mark}hinese **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**ommunist
**[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}**arty decides to
[[invade]{.underline}]{.mark} the island, [[its leaders may
not]{.underline}]{.mark} be able to [[accept
failure]{.underline}]{.mark} without seriously harming the regime's
legitimacy. Thus, [the CCP might]{.underline} be willing to [take
**significant risks** to ensure that the conflict ends on terms that it
finds acceptable]{.underline}. That would mean convincing the United
States and its allies that the costs of defending Taiwan are so high
that it is not worth contesting the invasion. While China has several
ways to achieve that goal, from Beijing's perspective, [using
**[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}** [may be the **most
effective**]{.mark} **means** to keep the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[out of the conflict]{.underline}**.

China is several decades into transforming its People's Liberation Army
(PLA) into what the Chinese President Xi Jinping has called a
"world-class military" that could defeat any third party that comes to
Taiwan's defense. China's warfighting strategy, known as
"anti-access/area denial," rests on being able to project conventional
military power out several thousand miles in order to prevent the
American military, in particular, from effectively countering a Chinese
attack on Taiwan. Meanwhile, a growing nuclear arsenal provides Beijing
with coercive leverage as well as potentially new warfighting
capabilities, which could increase the risks of war and escalation.

China has historically possessed only a few hundred ground-based nuclear
weapons. But last year, nuclear scholars at the James Martin Center for
Nonproliferation Studies and the Federation of American Scientists
identified three missile silo fields under construction in the Xinjiang
region. The Financial Times reported that China might have carried out
tests of hypersonic gliders as a part of an orbital bombardment system
that could evade missile defenses and deliver nuclear weapons to targets
in the continental United States. The U.S. Department of Defense
projects that by 2030, China will have around 1,000 deliverable
warheads---more than triple the number it currently possesses. Based on
these projections, Chinese leaders may believe that as early as five
years from now the PLA will have made enough conventional and nuclear
gains that it could fight and win a war to unify with Taiwan.

Our recent war game---in which members of Congress, former government
officials, and subject matter experts assumed the roles of senior
national security decision makers in China and the United
States---illustrated that [[a]{.mark} U.S.-Chinese [war]{.mark} could
[escalate quickly]{.mark}]{.underline}. For one thing, it showed that
[**[both countries]{.mark}** would [face]{.mark} **operational
[incentives]{.mark}** [to strike]{.mark}]{.underline} military forces on
[[the **other's territory**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the game, such
strikes were intended to be calibrated to avoid escalation; both sides
tried to walk a fine line by attacking only military targets. But
[**such [attacks]{.mark}** [crossed **red lines**]{.mark} for both
countries, [and produced a]{.mark} **tit-for-tat [cycle]{.mark}** of
attacks [that broadened]{.mark} the **scope and [intensity]{.mark}** of
the conflict]{.underline}.

For instance, in the simulation, China launched a preemptive attack
against key U.S. bases in the Indo-Pacific region. The attacks targeted
Guam, in particular, because it is a forward operating base critical to
U.S. military operations in Asia, and because since it is a territory,
and not a U.S. state, the Chinese team viewed striking it as less
escalatory than attacking other possible targets. In response, the
United States targeted Chinese military ships in ports and surrounding
facilities, but refrained from other attacks on the Chinese mainland.
Nevertheless, both sides perceived these strikes as attacks on their
home territory, crossing an important threshold. Instead of
mirror-imaging their own concerns about attacks on their territory, each
side justified the initial blows as military necessities that were
limited in nature and would be seen by the other as such. Responses to
the initial strikes only escalated things further as the U.S. team
responded to China's moves by hitting targets in mainland China, and the
Chinese team responded to Washington's strikes by attacking sites in
Hawaii.

A NEW ERA

One particularly alarming finding from the war game is that China found
it necessary to threaten to go nuclear from the start in order to ward
off outside support for Taiwan. This threat was repeated throughout the
game, particularly after mainland China had been attacked. At times,
efforts to erode Washington's will so that it would back down from the
fight received greater attention by the China team than the invasion of
Taiwan itself. But China had difficulty convincing the United States
that its nuclear threats were credible. In real life, China's
significant and recent changes to its nuclear posture and readiness may
impact other nations' views, as its nuclear threats may not be viewed as
credible given its stated doctrine of no first use, its smaller but
burgeoning nuclear arsenal, and lack of experience making nuclear
threats. This may push China to preemptively detonate a nuclear weapon
to reinforce the credibility of its warning.

China might also resort to a demonstration of its nuclear might because
of constraints on its long-range conventional strike capabilities. Five
years from now, the PLA still will have a very limited ability to launch
conventional attacks beyond locations in the "second island chain" in
the Pacific; namely, Guam and Palau. Unable to strike the U.S. homeland
with conventional weapons, China would struggle to impose costs on the
American people. Up until a certain point in the game, the U.S. team
felt its larger nuclear arsenal was sufficient to deter escalation and
did not fully appreciate the seriousness of China's threats. As a
result, China felt it needed to escalate significantly to send a message
that the U.S. homeland could be at risk if Washington did not back down.
Despite China's stated "no-first use" nuclear policy, the war game
resulted in Beijing detonating a nuclear weapon off the coast of Hawaii
as a demonstration. The attack caused relatively little destruction, as
the electromagnetic pulse only damaged the electronics of ships in the
immediate vicinity but did not directly impact the U.S. state. The war
game ended before the U.S. team could respond, but it is likely that the
first use of a nuclear weapon since World War II would have provoked a
response.

The most likely paths to nuclear escalation in a fight between the
United States and China are different from those that were most likely
during the Cold War. The Soviet Union and the United States feared a
massive, bolt-from-the-blue nuclear attack, which would precipitate a
full-scale strategic exchange. In a confrontation over Taiwan, however,
Beijing could employ nuclear weapons in a more limited way to signal
resolve or to improve its chances of winning on the battlefield. It is
unclear how a war would proceed after that kind of limited nuclear use
and whether the United States could de-escalate the situation while
still achieving its objectives.

AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION

The clear lesson from the war game is that [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [needs to strengthen its **conventional
capabilities**]{.underline} in the Indo-Pacific [[to ensure]{.mark} that
[China never views]{.mark} an **[invasion]{.mark} of Taiwan**
[as]{.mark} a **[prudent]{.mark} tactical move**]{.underline}. To do so,
the United States will need to commit to maintaining its conventional
military superiority by expanding its stockpiles of long-range munitions
and investing in undersea capabilities. Washington must also be able to
conduct offensive operations inside the first and second island chains
even while under attack. This will require access to new bases to
distribute U.S. forces, enhance their survivability, and ensure that
they can effectively defend Taiwan in the face of China's attacks.

Moreover, [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[needs to]{.underline}]{.mark}
develop an integrated network of partners willing to [[contribute to
**Taiwan**]{.mark}**'s defense**]{.underline}. Allies are an asymmetric
advantage: the United States has them, and China does not. The United
States should [[deepen]{.mark} **strategic** and **operational
[planning]{.mark}** with **key partners** [to]{.mark} send a **strong
[signal of resolve]{.mark}** to China]{.underline}. As part of these
planning efforts, the United States and its allies will need to develop
war-winning military strategies that do not cross Chinese red-lines. The
game highlighted just how difficult this task may be; what it did not
highlight is the complexity of developing military strategies that
integrate the strategic objectives and military capacities of multiple
nations.

Moving forward, military planners in the United States and in
Washington's allies and partners must grapple with the fact that, in a
conflict over Taiwan, China would consider all conventional and nuclear
options to be on the table. And [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[is **running out of
time**]{.underline}]{.mark} to strengthen deterrence and keep China from
believing an invasion of Taiwan could be successful. The biggest risk is
that Washington and its friends choose not to seize the moment and act:
[**[a year]{.mark} or two [from now]{.mark}**, it [might]{.mark} already
[be **too late**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Action,"

As the head of Taiwan's Department of Cyber Security noted, [[Taiwan's
"**c**]{.underline}]{.mark}ritical
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**nfrastructure, such as gas, water and
electricity [[are **highly digitized**," meaning]{.mark} that the right
[**cyberattack** from **China** could]{.mark} prove **catastrophic** and
[leave the **island in disarray**]{.mark}]{.underline}. More than a few
commentators have suggested that, [[in the event of]{.mark} an
[**invasion**, Beijing would]{.mark}]{.underline} very likely
[[seek]{.underline}]{.mark} a fait accompli victory---[[a]{.mark}
decisively [**rapid takeover** of the island involving a]{.mark}
**debilitating [cyberattack]{.mark}**]{.underline} that would avoid a
longer and more costly war with the U.S. Due to Taiwan's level of
networked sophistication and Beijing's strategic imperatives, [the
**unprecedented use** of **cyberwarfare** in Taiwan is **more likely
than not**]{.underline}. 

But emerging cyberwarfare tactics differ markedly from conventional
dynamics, not least in the degree to which they are covert and
preemptive. Networks can be infiltrated silently and exploited months
later in an explosive instant. And while the estimated 200-400
cyberattacks that Taiwan endures from China each month don't constitute
acts of war, [[even **one**]{.mark} **successful [attempt]{.mark}** [to
**worm** into Taiwan's networks could prove **more destructive** than
any bomb]{.mark} if a **military conflict** were to kick
off]{.underline}. Put simply, cyberwarfare would commence well before
formal conflict. 

Building on successful U.S.-Taiwan joint cyberwar exercises, [[the U.S.
needs to work with Taipei to **threat-hunt**]{.mark} on Taiwanese
networks]{.underline} as soon as possible. Cyberattacks do not
necessarily constitute acts of war, so [the U.S. [aiding]{.mark}

[wouldn't]{.mark} **substantively [risk upsetting]{.mark}**
[today's]{.mark}]{.underline} delicate [political [equilibrium]{.mark}

would, however, give the island-state a fighting chance against the

for a potential Chinese invasion,"

"[This is **the decade of [concern]{.mark}**]{.underline}, particularly
the period [[between **now** and **2027**]{.underline}]{.mark}," says
Phil Davidson, a retired admiral who commanded US forces in the
Indo-Pacific until last year. "I make that assessment [[because]{.mark}
of the [**staggering improvements** in Chinese **military**]{.mark}
**capabilities**]{.underline} and capacities, [the **[political
timeline]{.mark}** for **Xi Jinping** [and]{.mark} the **long-range
[economic challenges]{.mark}** in **China's future**]{.underline}."

Although China's threat to seize Taiwan by force has been in place ever
since the Chinese Nationalist government and army fled to Taiwan in 1949
after losing the civil war on the mainland, [Beijing]{.underline} had
[long focused on]{.underline} pulling the island into its fold with
[**economic lure** and **political pressure**]{.underline}.

[But]{.underline} many Taiwanese policymakers now believe that [as the
**C**]{.underline}hinese **[C]{.underline}**ommunist
**[p]{.underline}**arty [loses hope these measures will **ever
work**]{.underline} and with its armed forces modernising rapidly, [Xi
might opt for war **soon**]{.underline}.

Taiwan came into renewed focus as an increasingly dangerous flashpoint
just days after Biden's inauguration last year when Chinese warplanes
simulated missile attacks on a US aircraft carrier sailing in the
vicinity of the country. Over the following months, [China]{.underline}
then [boosted the **tempo and size** of **fighter jet** and **bomber
sorties** near Taiwan]{.underline}.

Davidson sounded the alarm in March last year, telling the Senate armed
services committee that he believed [the threat of a **Chinese attack**
on Taiwan would "manifest . . . in the **next six years**]{.underline}".
Shortly thereafter, [a **senior US official** told]{.underline} the
Financial Times [that Xi was **flirting** with the idea of **seizing
control**]{.underline}.

Since then such warnings have become more widespread --- the background
to Biden's comments about responding to a Chinese invasion. It has also
accelerated a shift in the conversation between Taiwan and the US over
how to defend the island.

Although Washington has been urging Taipei for years to take that risk
more seriously, the Taiwanese government and military were slow to
respond. But the war in Ukraine has served as a wake-up call. Senior
Taiwanese officials say Russia's assault on its neighbour has
highlighted the threat they face.

a Chinese attack on Taiwan will manifest by 2027 © Hugh Gentry/Reuters

"The danger comes from [[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping and the fact
that he will begin a third term later this year," says one official.
"Under China's previous process where they would
[[have]{.underline}]{.mark} a new leader every 10 years, their
[**'[historic mission']{.mark}** [of **unifying
Taiwan**]{.mark}]{.underline} could be passed on to the next leader. But
when a national mission becomes one man's mission, the danger rises."

"Putin would not have made a decision like this to invade Ukraine if he
wasn't deciding everything by himself. So [[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}
Jinping [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} well [[make this]{.mark} **kind of
[misjudgement]{.mark}**]{.underline} as well," the official adds.

A shift from ambiguity

While the Russian invasion of Ukraine has focused attention on the
potential threat to Taiwan, there is one big difference between the two
situations: [a Chinese [**war on Taiwan** could be a **war with the
US**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

When Washington switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing
in 1979, it replaced its mutual defence treaty with Taiwan with the
Taiwan Relations Act. The law requires the US to give the country the
weapons needed to defend itself, and to maintain the US's own capacity
to resist force or coercion that would jeopardise Taiwan's security.

In the past, the US kept it ambiguous how far that commitment went. In
an attempt to both deter Beijing from considering military force and
discourage Taipei from formalising its independence, Washington declined
to spell out whether it would enter a war between the two.

Biden appears to have drastically reduced that ambiguity. Asked by a
reporter during his recent trip to Japan if he was willing to use force
to defend Taiwan, he said: "Yes. That is the commitment we made." The
White House hurried to stress --- as it did after Biden's previous
similar statements which some analysts viewed as gaffes --- that US
policy towards Taiwan has not changed.

[told a reporter he was **willing to use force** to **defend
Taiwan**]{.underline} © Eugene Hoshiko/Pool/EPA-EFE

But senior officials in Taiwan and countries allied with the US believe
Biden is trying to deter Beijing by signalling more clearly it might
have to fight the US, too. "We think Biden has made a political decision
to demonstrate that this option cannot be excluded," says a senior
Taiwanese official.

"In the Ukraine case, he said beforehand that the US would not enter the
war. But when China feels that their military capability has reached the
level ready for taking Taiwan, just using financial or economic
sanctions will not create an effective deterrence," he says. "So you
must absolutely not let China believe that you will not take military
action."

Although there is growing concern about a possible invasion, the
timeframe of any military action --- and China's real intentions --- are
still the subject of intense debate.

The year Davidson sees as the potential time horizon for a Chinese
attack, 2027, is the centenary of the People's Liberation Army. In
November 2020, the Chinese Communist party said it wanted to "ensure
that the 100-year military building goal is achieved by 2027", called
for faster military modernisation and reiterated the goal of making the
Chinese military fit for networked, "intelligentised" warfare.

Although those are stock phrases China has used before, [the Pentagon
calls 2027 a]{.underline} "**[new milestone]{.underline}**". "If
realised, [the **[PLA's 2027]{.mark} modernisation [goals]{.mark}**
[could provide Beijing with]{.mark} more **credible [military
options]{.mark}** in a Taiwan contingency]{.underline}," it said in its
annual report on the Chinese military last year.

Some analysts doubt Davidson's date. But one year on from his testimony,
[**government** and **military officials**]{.underline} in both Taipei
and Washington [say [the window]{.mark} from **now to 2027** [is a
**genuine threat**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**2025**]{.underline}. "The current situation is really the most
dangerous I have seen in my more than 40 years in the military," he told
lawmakers.

### \*1NC\-\--Misinformation 

#### CYBERCOM is tackling [information warfare]{.underline}, but [maintained resources]{.underline} are key.

Mark **Pomerleau 22**, reporter for DefenseScoop, covering information
warfare and cyberspace, 3/11/22, "Cyber Command moving toward an
integrated information warfare approach,"
https://www.fedscoop.com/cyber-command-moving-toward-an-integrated-information-warfare-approach/,
Marsh

U.S. **[Cyber Com]{.underline}**mand [is looking to more **tightly link
cyberspace** "effects" operations with **information
operations**]{.underline}, according to its deputy commander.

When asked where he sees the command headed in the next five to 10
years, Lt. Gen. Charles Moore said he hopes [it will broaden the concept
of a "**truly synchronized** and **integrated information warfare
approach**]{.underline}."

"Without a doubt, what we have learned is that cyber effects operations
in ... more of a combined arms approach with what we call traditionally
[information operations, is]{.underline} an [**extremely powerful**
tool]{.underline}," he said Thursday at Cybercom's legal conference.

Cybercom has reportedly begun engaging in some level of combined
operations along these lines. It has been reported that [the command has
sent messages to **Russian cyber operatives** letting them know the
**U.S. military** knows who they are and]{.underline} what
[they're]{.underline} doing as a means of [**deterring**
their]{.underline} potential **[future malicious activity]{.underline}**
aimed against the U.S.

[Many of the organization's **subordinate commands** have taken on
a **larger role** in info warfare]{.underline} for their respective
services, [**reorganizing** and **consolidating**]{.underline} similar
[capabilities to provide an integrated approach]{.underline}.

Former officials have pushed for a stronger alignment of cyber ops and
information ops.

"When you can perform information operations to influence adversaries'
perceptions and maybe their behavior in conjunction with those effects,
you can position yourself to see real-time reflections on how they're
assessing what you're conducting. And then you can stay ahead of their
decision cycle, inside of their OODA loop: their observe, orient, decide
and action \[cycle\]. And you can do that at speed over time," Moore
said. "That's where we want to be. That's an extremely powerful tool
inside the Department of Defense's toolkit."

Previously, Moore had explained that under DOD's authorities and ability
to gain access to different types of networks and social media, it can
be positioned to see what the adversary is thinking.

"What that allows us to do is in a very precise manner to target
individuals or groups of messages that we know will have an effect. And
then when you combine that with actual cyber effects itself in a very
combined arms approach ... \[it allows Cybercom\] to drive the enemy's
decision calculus and cycle," he said during an event hosted by
C4ISRNET last year.

While cyber operators are experts in networks, not information ops, the
services have begun aligning information operations specialists to work
alongside cyber operators.

Despite having the necessary policies and authorities in place to
execute these types of operations, Moore said DOD will need to harness
emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data
analytics and even quantum computing to truly be successful in the
future.

"You're going to need these types of capabilities to execute across the
breadth, the scope, the depth and the speed that's going to be necessary
to stay ahead of the adversaries and really drive their decisions
cycles, drive their perceptions as opposed to being driven," he said.

[A **better grasp** of information warfare]{.underline} and what that
looks like across the federal government and Department of Defense [is
warranted]{.underline}, Moore said. He explained that [the
Pentagon]{.underline} and the nation [need to **focus** on a strategy
aimed at affecting **adversary perceptions**]{.underline}.

[Such a **strategy**]{.underline} or an approach [should inform the
government on what types of **things to invest in**, what to **reveal**
and **conceal**, what and when to exercise **capabilities** and
**concepts**, and when to conduct **troop movements**]{.underline}.

On the existential threat from cyber-enabled information warfare

Corruption of the information ecosystem has become an existential threat
to civilization as we know it because prosperity and advancement depend
on a secure information infrastructure and environment that provides
human beings with contextualized, reli­able, trustworthy information when
and where it is needed. Information is as much a part of human ecol­ogy
and the essence of being human as DNA (itself a form of information!) is
a part of the evolutionary processes in biological systems.

Today, chaos reigns in much of the information ecosys­tem on which
societies depend. In many forums for poli­tical and societal discourse,
national leaders shout about fake news, by which they mean information
they do not like. These same leaders lie shamelessly, calling their lies
truth, or perhaps \"truthful hyperbole.\" Acting across national
boundaries, these leaders and their surrogates exacerbate existing
divisions, creating rage and diminish­ing confidence in elections and
democratic institutions. Using unsupported anecdotes and sketchy
rhetoric, deni- alists undermine well-established science about climate
change and other urgent issues. Established institutions of the
government, journalism, and education - institutions that have
traditionally provided stability - are under attack precisely because
they have provided stability.

The founding of the Bulletin predates by several dec­ades the widespread
availability of computers, the Internet, smart phones, search engines,
and social media. Few could imagine in 1945 a technological envir­onment
that affords today\'s high-speed and widespread connectivity, high
degrees of anonymity, insensitivity to distance and national borders,
easy and customized information searches, democratized access to
publishing capabilities, inexpensive production and consumption of
information content (including and increasingly impor­tantly emotionally
evocative video and audio content), disintermediation of established
information sources, and ubiquitous, always-on, always-available access
to information sources through mobile devices.

Such advances in information technology have her­alded the arrival of the
information age, a world in which taking near-immediate advantage of
information opens up enormous opportunities in both the private and
pub­lic sectors for improved delivery of existing products and services
and, perhaps more important, the creation of entirely new products and
services. Products and ser­vices can be customized to individual needs
and prefer­ences on a large scale and at more affordable costs.
Transactional friction can be tremendously reduced. Through the Internet
of Things, actuators and sensors can be connected to process control
computers to opti­mize the behavior and function of physical systems.
Everywhere that information can be used to create and improve new and
existing functionality (that is, essen­tially everywhere), one can find
or imagine new informa­tion technologies to do so.

At the same time, advances in information technology have a dark side.
The same increases in the volume and velocity of information have
created a louder and more chaotic information environment that
stimulates fast, angry, reflexive, intuitive, and visceral thinking,
reaction, and action in people and thus displaces more complex,
reflective, and rational thought. In a chaotic environment of
information overload, people are more likely to use mental shortcuts as
a way to reduce the cognitive bur­den that such an environment places on
their thinking.

In recent years, we have seen how the Internet, social media, and mobile
devices (and other technologies) can be used by foreign adversaries to
interfere in elections and to disrupt the democratic process. We have
seen:

Social media exploitation of cognitive biases to increase their impact
and reach - short messages of 280 characters and emotionally evocative
video/ audio clips are nearly ubiquitous and much more the norm than
they ever were two decades ago.

Disintermediation of established information sources that reduces the
role and influence of those pre­viously responsible for providing factual
information and proliferates information sources. The US Supreme Court
noted in Associated Press v. US (1945) that \"the widest possible
dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is
essential to the welfare of the public, that a free press is a condition
of a free society.\" Today, modern information technol­ogy has enabled
the creation of a larger number of information sources than the 1945 US
Supreme Court could possibly have imagined.

Search engines that return highly visible results for queries based in
large part on the popularity of those results and the inferred desires
of the user for specific information rather than their actual importance
to those queries. Such functionality also makes it easier than ever for
people to find information online \"by doing their own research,\" thus
indulging in their confirmation biases by selectively finding and
attend­ing only to information that confirms one\'s beliefs. Search
engine optimization techniques enable gam­ing of search algorithms to
promote the visibility of false, misleading, or worthless information.

Many-to-many connectivity that enables the for­mation of echo chambers
and media bubbles that reinforce pre-existing beliefs.

Large-scale data mining that allows adversaries to sift huge amounts of
personal data on individuals to identify and target those most
susceptible to customized, inflammatory, false, malign, or mis­leading
messages - and also to keep such mes­sages away from public view.

Near-immediate data transfer, which enables pro­paganda and other malign
information to spread far and wide quickly, while efforts to correct
false information are more expensive, often fall short, and frequently
fail altogether.

Inauthentic voices that are largely indistinguishable from authentic
ones. Macedonian entrepreneurs discovered ways to monetize an affinity
of Trump voters for fake news (Subramanian 2017). Paid human employees
of the Internet Research Agency created and spread false information on
behalf of the Russian government prior to the 2016 U.S. election
(MacFarquhar 2018). And automated \"bots\"-accounts purportedly
associated with human users but in fact managed entirely or mostly by
machines - add further chaos to the information environment.

Is this state of information affairs really new? Haven\'t adversaries of
all stripes always employed propaganda and lies - otherwise known as
information warfare (or at least a big part of it) - to advance their
interests?

Yes. Information warfare indeed has a long pedigree that reaches into
the past for at least the three millen­nia since the Trojan Horse enabled
Greek warriors to breach the walls around the city of Troy. Much more
recently, the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany relied on propaganda.
As Hitler (1925, 155-56) wrote:

\[I\]ts purpose must be \... to attract the attention of the masses and
not by any means to dispense individual instructions to those who
already have an educated opi­nion on things or who wish to form such an
opinion on grounds of objective study - because that is not the pur­pose
of propaganda, it must appeal to the feelings of the public rather than
to their reasoning powers. . . . The art of propaganda consists
precisely in being able to awaken the imagination of the public through
an appeal to their feel­ings, in finding the appropriate psychological
form that will arrest the attention and appeal to the hearts of the
national masses. \... The receptive powers of the masses are very
restricted, and their understanding is feeble.

But more so today than at any earlier point in human history, human
beings are vulnerable to information war­fare. At the same time that new
information technologies have led to an increase in the volume and
velocity of information available on Earth by many orders of magni­tude
in the past few decades, the cognitive architecture of the human mind is
more or less unchanged on the time scale of centuries or even millennia.

On human cognition

Research in the fields of cognitive and social psychol­ogy has formalized
what Hitler knew intuitively. We now understand that human cognitive
processing cap­ability is not unlimited; humans have finite cognitive
resources that can be \"used up\" under mentally stress­ful
circumstances. Findings from the same cognitive psychology that has
transformed neoclassical econom­ics into behavioral economics (and
resulted in three Nobel Prizes in economics) have made clear the
\"bounded rationality\" of human thought and the simultaneous existence
in every individual of the cap­ability to engage in two types of
cognitive processing.

Specifically, heuristic dual-system cognitive theory posits that human
beings have two systems for cogni­tive processing - an intuitive,
reflexive, and emotionally driven mode of thought (often designated as
System 1) and a slower, more deliberate, analytical mode of thought
(often designated as System 2). Kahneman (2011) provides a primer on
System 1 and System 2 thinking. (See Petty and Cacioppo 1986; Chaiken
1987 for other variants of dual-system cognitive theory; see Kruglanski
and Thompson 1999 for a contrary view on dual-system cognitive theory.)

System 1 is designed to operate rapidly, but it can do so because it
does not take account of all available information and is thus more
prone to error (also called bias). System 2 operates more slowly but is
more likely to take into account the available information and is less
prone to error. People engaging in System 1 infor­mation processing
respond more emotionally and less rationally or critically than in
System 2 processing.

Most important, System 1 thinking is the default mode of thought for
human beings - it uses smaller amounts of cognitive resources, relies on
simple gut- based judgments, and is used more often when humans are
under stress. For most situations encoun­tered in everyday life, System 1
thinking is adequate and produces mostly valid and useful outcomes, but
it often fails when a situation requires complex inferences for
understanding. For such situations, System 2 think­ing, which is
effortful and consumptive of cognitive resources, is more often
appropriate - and when indi­viduals fail to use System 2 when it is
appropriate to do so, they are easily misled.

Most individuals are capable of both System 1 and System 2 thinking;
thus, the important operative question is the circumstances under which
they select one or the other type of thinking. Psychology has
accumulated considerable evidence relevant to this question.

For example, Taber and Lodge (2006) show that an individual tends to be
less critical of information that is favorable to his or her position
than of information that is not favorable - that is, he or she is more
likely to engage in System 1 thinking for favorable information. People
have a confirmation bias in their information seeking and processing
behavior - they preferentially seek out information that is consistent
with their beliefs and they are highly critical of (or ignore)
information that contradicts their beliefs. In a meta-analysis of 91
studies, Hart et al. (2009) considered two motivations for how an
individual might select information to consume - the desire to gain an
accurate understanding of reality and the desire to feel validated in
his or her beliefs. These two motivations conflict when an accurate
understanding of reality does not validate one\'s beliefs, and such a
situation motivates the question of which of these motivations is more
powerful. Hart et al. concluded that both motivations drive human
information- seeking behavior, thus moderating each other to a certain
extent, but that on balance, humans do exhibit a tendency towards the
validation of their beliefs. People are also subject to belief
perseverance (a.k.a. a continuing influence effect) - a cognitive bias
through which individuals do not revise beliefs based on erro­neous
information even when they know for sure that such information is
erroneous (Lewandowsky et al. 2012).

Maintenance of an individual\'s social identity is an important
influence on his or her invocation of System 1 or System 2 thinking.
Evidence suggests that indivi­duals tend to adopt the views of the peer
groups that are most salient to them, even if the \"objective\" or
\"factual\" information available to them contradicts those views. (Asch
1951 performed the classic \"confor­mity experiments\" that demonstrated
this phenomenon in the early 1950s.) Uncritical System 1 thinking is
active in processing information that is consonant with the beliefs and
attitudes of those peer groups. Critical and skeptical System 2 thinking
is active in processing infor­mation that is dissonant to those groups\'
beliefs. These effects (that individuals tend to accept salient group
norms) are even more pronounced in an anonymous environment, such as
that which characterizes much online interaction (Postmes et al. 2001).

Lastly, there is evidence that emotion and motivation affect cognition.
For example, people who are angry tend to rely more heavily on simple
heuristic cues (sug­gestive of System 1 thinking) than those who are not
angry (Bodenhausen, Sheppard, and Kramer 1994). Individuals are more
likely to stereotype people (a form of System 1 thinking) when that
stereotype is consistent with their desired impression of those people;
conver­sely, when the stereotype is inconsistent with their desired
impression, individuals tend to inhibit the use of this stereotype
(Kunda and Sinclair 1999). Negative emotions (such as those induced by
the receipt of infor­mation incongruent with a person\'s prior beliefs)
can improve the ability of a person to reason logically, thus enabling
him or her to negate or discount that informa­tion (Goel and Vartanian
2011).

In the new information environment, exploitation of human cognitive
architecture and capabilities - which are largely unchanged from what
existed millennia ago - provides the 21st century information warrior
with cyber- enabled capabilities that Hitler, Stalin, Goebbels, and
McCarthy could have only imagined. By exploiting cogni­tive limitations,
the perpetrators of cyber-enabled infor­mation warfare have learned to
exacerbate prejudices, biases, and ideological differences; to add heat
but no light to political discourse; and to spread widely believed
\"alternative facts\" in advancing their political positions.

Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential elec­tion has dominated
news headlines ever since. But interference by authoritarian countries
in the elections of democratic states - as undesirable and threatening
as it may be - is hardly the only negative consequence of cyber-enabled
information warfare. The problems of nuclear war and climate change are
hard enough to solve even when well-intentioned, well-informed par­ties
on all sides share a basic understanding and knowl­edge of the relevant
facts. Yes, they may have different values and different priorities, may
act under different constraints, and be able to bring to bear different
levels of resources to these problems.

But without shared, fact-based understandings of the blast, thermal, and
radiation effects of nuclear explosions, what hope is there for national
leaders to reach agreements to reduce the threat of nuclear holo­caust or
to make good decisions about nuclear weap­ons use in times of crisis?
Without shared, fact-based understandings that rising atmospheric carbon
dioxide concentrations caused by human beings result in cor­responding
increases in global temperature and cli­matic disruption, what hope is
there for national leaders to reach agreements to begin serious efforts
at decarbonizing their economies?

Climate change denialism

Climate change denialism can be fairly characterized as cyber-enabled
information warfare against the reality of large-scale
anthropogenically-induced climate change. In the responses of people
resistant to taking action to miti­gate climate change, we see a number
of psychological factors at work (Zaval and Cornwell 2016). For example,
one key element of System 1 thinking is the availability heuristic, with
which individuals tend to associate the like­lihood of an event with the
ease with which they can remember similar events in the past. But the
long-term consequences of climate change are unprecedented in recorded
human history and obviously people have no personal memories of
unprecedented events.

Moreover, climate change is a long-term process whose inexorable
progression is easily masked by short-term fluc­tuations in local weather
conditions. For example, public concerns about climate changes correlate
with local weather conditions (Krosnick et al. 2006). Climate change
deniers are also quick to flag for public attention days that are
particularly cold as \"evidence\" that global warming is not occurring
and thus, they claim, discrediting theories of climate change. This
illustrates a bias known as attribute substitution, as Kahneman and
Frederick (2002) describe, through which individuals substitute salient
information (such as the cold temperature today) for information that is
more relevant but harder to understand (such as infor­mation about global
climate change).

People are also subject to a loss-aversion bias, in which they place
greater weight on losses than gains of equal value. In 1992, the United
States committed itself to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change, although President George HW Bush also stated that \"the
American way of life is not up for negotiation\" - and in 2018, the
United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement (which was based on the
convention). The argument? That the United States would have to give up
too much if it kept to the agreement.

To close this (merely illustrative) exploration of biases relevant to
climate change denialism, the optimism bias suggests that people
consider themselves exceptions when considering the likelihood of a
negative event occurring. That is, bad things may happen to other
peo­ple, but they won\'t happen to me, even though I and those other
people are similar in important and relevant ways. In a climate context,
the bad things may involve sea level rise or heat waves - and the
misperception that \"others may suffer from such problems but I won\'t\"
diminishes the power of personal concern as a driver for rational
decision making.

Connecting the operation of these cognitive biases to the affordances of
modern information technologies is not difficult. For example, Roxburgh
et al. (2019) demonstrate how the characteristics of specific weather
events (e.g. hurricanes or snowstorms) and \"short-term socio-political
context can play a critical role in deter­mining the lenses through which
climate change is viewed.\" Note especially the importance of
\"short-term socio-political context\" - precisely the context that
social media shapes.

Elsasser and Dunlap (2013) noted the influential role of a variety of
newspaper columnists in advancing denialist arguments and thus
amplifying these argu­ments to a broad segment of the American public.
Fewer in number then, essentially all columnists today (of all political
leanings) have a social media presence that they use to publicize their
work, and in many instances their online presence is driven in
significant part by social media and reach many more readers online than
in print. Furthermore, subtleties and nuan­ces in their extended written
pieces are likely to be lost when they are represented in social media.

Another important element of climate change denial- ism is the easy
accessibility of seemingly-authoritative information that casts doubt on
the well-established science of climate change. As reported by The
Guardian, a variety of largely secret funding sources distributed \$118
million to 102 denialist organizations (Goldenberg 2013). Oreskes and
Conway (2011) provide the definitive work on deliberate information
campaigns to obscure the scientific truth on a range of issues from
smoking to climate change. These denialist organizations have gen­erated
a variety of products for public and policy con­sumption (but -
unsurprisingly - not many peer-reviewed scientific articles) that are
easily accessible to the public, mainstream media outlets, and policy
makers. Their pro­ducts are broadly disseminated through social media and
easily found through customized search, and they are sought by reporters
who seeking to cover \"both sides\" of a controversy that is
intellectually equivalent to a \"controversy\" about whether the earth
is round or flat.

Nuclear conflict

On the risks of nuclear conflict, theories and approaches to nuclear
deterrence and strategic stability developed prior to the collapse of
the Soviet Union in the late 1980\'s and early 1990\'s rest on the
presumption of rationality in national decision makers. In particular,
they assume that adversaries are deterred from attacking by a threat of
retaliation that would impose costs on the adversary that would outweigh
any conceivable benefits that it would gain from an attack (Morgan
2003). Central to this assumption is a rational adversary that can and
does make a calculation of expected costs and benefits, com­pares them,
and then acts accordingly.

But the psychologically informed understanding of real- world decision
making described above was not accepted widely in the scientific
literature until approximately the same time as the collapse of the
Soviet Union, and the seminal work in such understanding occurred only
in the decade previous to that. What a psychologically-informed
understanding of real-world decision making tells us is that the
rationality assumption at the base of much traditional thinking on
deterrence and strategic stability is untenable, given that humans have
evolved to rely on intuitive, reflex­ive, heuristic System 1 thinking to
make decisions, particu­larly when faced with time pressures, surprise
and other obstacles to the deliberate calculation implied by System 2
thinking (Kahneman 2011). Psychology tells us that - more often than
not - the fast, intuitive judgements of System 1 often take precedence
over the slower, more analytical thinking of System 2.

The challenges posed by reflexive reliance on System 1 thinking are
greatly accentuated by characteristics of today\'s information
environment. Social media networks in particular are optimally designed
to stimulate System 1 thinking - emotional, reflexive, immediate - and
they rapidly transmit content among like-minded individuals, creating
the ideal conditions for public polarization and divisiveness to occur
(Pfeffer, Zorbach, and Carley 2014). Multiple narratives rapidly emerge
around complex events; citizens splinter into their own informational
universes and are unable to agree on an underlying reality. Political
leaders themselves are subject to these conflicting narratives and may
even be active and influ­ential participants in one or another of them.

It is thus easy to posit that in this information envir­onment,
manipulated information - either artificially constructed or adopted by
a strong grassroots base - could be used by interested parties to
generate pres­sure on leaders to act. At the same time, leaders
them­selves are likely to be facing information overload and less able to
distinguish analyzed information from their own intelligence sources and
other, unvetted informa­tion originating from their constituencies.

The coming information dystopia

Nuclear war and climate change are arguably the most important
existential challenges today that are com­pounded by the corruption of
the information ecosys­tem. But even if a single miraculous stroke the
laws of physics were changed to make nuclear weapons impos­sible to build
and operate and to immediately eliminate anthropogenic emissions at zero
cost, cyber-enabled information warfare could still can lead to an
informa­tion dystopia. Here are some possible elements:

• Adversaries manufacture numerous graphic videos of American soldiers
(complete with sound effects) committing battlefield atrocities, and
spread them widely through the Internet. Once upon a time, high- quality
video forgeries were difficult and expensive to make. AI-based
technologies will bring this so- called deepfake capability to the
masses, and anyone with imagination, a modicum of technical skill, and a
personal computer will be able to distribute rea­sonably realistic
forgeries. Denials will be issued but of course will also not be
believed by large fractions of viewers. Even if proof of inauthenticity
can be provided, such evidence will not affect the responses of many
viewers.

Political campaigns conduct similar efforts to dis­credit political
opponents (e.g. \"showing\" an oppo­nent making controversial or
disqualifying remarks before an election). But they also use the
existence of deepfake technologies to deflect attention from authentic
and real evidence of their own political and personal misdeeds. For
example, a real video of a candidate punching an old lady who supports
his opponent will be dismissed as \"one of those deepfakes that anyone
could have produced.\"

Financial markets are disrupted by falsified videos of CEOs making
announcements regarding company prospects that are much more pessimistic
than expected. Attempts to correct the record are drowned out in a
subsequent flood of contradictory informa­tion, all of which appear at
firstglance to be authentic.

Public safety is compromised by reports of local disasters (e.g.
explosions of chemical plants that result in the release large amounts
of toxic gases). These reports, along with \"authentic\" video of peo­ple
choking amidst locally familiar locations (e.g. well-known fields or
sport stadiums), cause sponta­neous mass evacuations. Contradictory
directions for evacuation broadcast using social media result in chaos
on the streets and highways.

Public health is placed at risk when the safety and efficacy of medical
treatments known to be safe and effective are publicly questioned
through active disinformation campaigns conducted on the Internet and in
bookstores. Attempts to pro­vide valid information are met with responses
such as \"that\'s what the pharmaceutical companies and medical
establishment want you to think, but just look at what\'s happened to
our children.\"

Children in schools are threatened by online cam­paigns to spread rumor,
innuendo, and positive or negative information about various students.
Conducting such campaigns for pay becomes the business model of
entrepreneurs who advertise that they can guarantee admission to
selective colleges, boost the social standing of the children of their
cli­ents, or take revenge on those who have harmed such children, all in
anonymous and untraceable ways.

Journalists, political leaders, and judges are com­promised by artfully
forged emails and alterations to other documents that are mixed with
entirely authentic leaked emails and documents and are indistinguishable
from them.

A world with these elements - and many more com­parable ones - will be
the inevitable result if and when deployment and use of the tools of
cyber-enabled infor­mation warfare become widespread. And even more
troubling is the fact that not every bit of information needs to be
corrupted for this dystopian outcome to occur - it will require only a
fraction of it to be corrupted for people to lose faith entirely in
\"objective\" and \"trust­worthy\" sources of information, the result of
which will be that people will fractionate into their own information
realities.

Fearing the end of the enlightenment

The Enlightenment established reason and reality as the foundational
pillars of civilized discourse. In such discourse, logic matters, and a
logical contradiction between state­ment A and statement B means that at
least one of those statements is false. The truth of a statement about
the world is tested by its correspondence to objective reality rather
than by how many people believe it; that is, empiri­cal data are
influential. Furthermore, statements known to be wrong or false do not
affect conclusions or choices between alternative courses of action.

Cyber-enabled information warfare provides the tac­tics, tools, and
procedures - in short, the means - to replace the pillars of logic,
truth, and reality with fan­tasy, rage, and fear. In a world of
ubiquitous cyber- enabled information warfare, communication and
infor­mation inflame passions rather than informing reason, play to the
worst in people\'s cognitive architectures rather than the best, and
divide rather than unify. Deliberate corruption of the information
ecosystem could be seen as an analog of poisoning water supplies that
can be done remotely, inexpensively, and anon­ymously. All of this is
just another way of saying that today it is possible to see glimmerings
of an anti- Enlightenment that can possibly take root and that would
indeed be the end of civilization as we know it.

Adversaries foreign and domestic that make use cyber-enabled information
warfare turn our internal cognitive processes and our external
institutional and legal processes against us. Under the cover of \"fair
play\" rubrics and the First Amendment, they have turned us against
ourselves. Desperately needed are ways of countering the insidious
tactics of cyber-enabled infor­mation warfare for ourselves.

How might we proceed? We need action to develop better ways of
identifying adversary cyber-enabled infor­mation warfare campaigns in
progress; good counter- measures to help human beings resist the use of
cyber- enabled information warfare operations targeted against them; and
good measures to degrade, disrupt, or expose the adversary\'s use of
cyber-enabled information warfare operations. All of this is easier said
than done, however, as cyber-enabled capabilities for information
warfare increase while human cognitive limitations remain the same. Our
work is cut out for us. If we fail, the world is at increasing risk of
large-scale and long-term societal frac­ture, the end of the
Enlightenment, and the start of an informational Dark Age.

### NSA DA\-\--1NC

#### The DOD's Cyber Command will remain wedded to the NSA [for now]{.underline}, but [growing capacity]{.underline} for CYBERCOM can [break it off]{.underline}.

Mark **Pomerleau 22**, reporter for DefenseScoop, covering information
warfare and cyberspace, 3/08/2022, "Cyber Command and NSA still working
to meet measures necessary to split,"
<https://www.fedscoop.com/cyber-command-and-nsa-still-working-to-meet-measures-necessary-to-split/>,
cc

Several years ago, [in response to]{.underline} rumors **[a
split]{.underline}** was imminent, [Congress felt such a decision was
**premature** and **Cyber Command** was **not ready**]{.underline} to
stand alone. As such, [Congress outlined a **series of metrics** for the
**Pentagon to meet**]{.underline} in the 2016 annual defense policy
bill. [Those metrics]{.underline} were then tweaked in the 2017 policy
bill adding more restrictions necessary to split the dual hat. They
[included that **each organization** have robust **command and control**
systems for **planning**, **deconflicting** and **executing** military
cyber operations and national intelligence operations]{.underline} as
well as ensuring tools and weapons used in cyber operations are
sufficient for achieving required effects. It also sought to ensure that
Cyber Command can acquire or develop these tools, weapons, and accesses.

In recent years, [Cyber Command has gained **significant**, **yet still
maturing**, acquisition authority to purchase its **own
capabilities**.]{.underline} It also developed what it calls the Joint
Cyber Warfighting Architecture, which guides the command's acquisition
priorities and includes major programs for infrastructure and tools
separate from those of the NSA.

Nakasone said that decisions to separate the infrastructures were made
before he took command, but he added they were good decisions and they
continue to carry out separate infrastructures.

[The **dual-hat arrangement** has been a **hotly debated
topic**]{.underline} in the cyber and intelligence world, with
proponents saying the military can benefit from the unique intelligence
insights and access of NSA, leading to faster decision-making and
operational outcomes. [Opponents argue the roles are **too powerful**
for **one person** and relying on intelligence infrastructure and
tools]{.underline}, which are meant to stay undetected, for military
activity poses risks to such espionage activity.

[Despite the initial dual-hat relationship, it was always understood
that it **would not be permanent**]{.underline} given the inherently
different missions of each organization: foreign intelligence and
warfighting.

[However, officials have **increasingly spoken favorably** about the
**nature of the relationship**]{.underline}, saying it provides a degree
of speed and synergy needed to keep pace in the modern digital world.

#### Funneling more [resources]{.underline} and [responsibility]{.underline} to CYBERCOM gives it [unprecedented autonomy]{.underline}, spurring separation from the NSA.

Jon R. **Lindsay 20**, assistant professor at the Munk School of Global
Affairs and Public Policy and the Department of Political Science at the
University of Toronto, 10/30/2020, "Cyber conflict vs. Cyber Command:
hidden dangers in the American military solution to a large-scale
intelligence problem," *Intelligence and National Security* 36(2),
https://doi.org/10.1080/02684527.2020.1840746, cc

Classic organization theory stresses that [bureaucratic [organizations
seek **resources**, **autonomy**, and **control**]{.mark}]{.underline},
guided by their historical cultural heritage or essential identity.64
For [[military org]{.mark}anization[s]{.mark}]{.underline} this
translates into a predilection for offensive doctrines, often described
as 'the cult of the offensive,' because they require expensive
capabilities, [[necessitate]{.mark} **[authority]{.mark}** for
**independent operations**]{.underline}, reduce uncertainty by setting
the operational tempo, and are [[consistent with a **warrior
ethos**]{.underline}]{.mark}.65 The institution of the U.S. Air Force is
an instructive example in this regard. Even when the Air Corps was
formally part of the U.S. Army, airmen developed an ambitious new
doctrine -- strategic bombing -- that advertised the ability to deliver
victory independently of the other services.66 The ideology of strategic
bombing served the Air Force well in interservice competition during its
formative years as an independent service, even if the theory often
proved disappointing in practice.67 A doctrine of independent strategic
effects helped to bolster the legitimacy of a newly independent command.
The newly autonomous U.S. Space Force tends to advance similar
arguments, cribbed from classic airpower theory, about the unique
strategic importance of the space domain and the specialized technical
skills needed to exploit it.68

From this perspective, CYBERCOM's doctrine of persistent engagement
plays a similar institutional role as strategic bombing did for the
early Air Force. [[New]{.mark} ideas about **[cyber
campaigns]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and accompanying authorities to carry
them out, [are supposed to [enable CYBERCOM]{.mark} to create meaningful
**strategic effects**]{.underline}. CYBERCOM advertises its intention to
act beneath the threshold of war to influence strategic adversaries.
Persistent engagement, from this perspective, might be described as a
nonlethal version of strategic bombing. Much as the Air Force seeks to
attack critical nodes in an enemy target system, using technology to
create strategic effects, cyber campaigns target critical information
nodes in the adversary's computer network to shape its behavior. The
comparison to the Air Force experience may be more than metaphorical. As
Sarah White notes in her study of U.S. military cyber subcultures, 'By
the end of 2007, the Air Force had emerged as the recognized service
leader in cyberspace. While the other services were engaged in the
patchwork pursuit of various cyberspacerelated initiatives, neither the
Army nor the Navy had the level of decisive senior leader engagement or
senior leader direction that existed in the Air Force in 2007.'69 The
Air Force approach, which has been influential in CYBERCOM's doctrinal
ruminations, was 'marked by the firm distinction of cyberspace as a
warfighting domain, the increasingly aggressive pursuit of autonomy in
cyberspace operations and organizations, and the creation of a dedicated
cyberspace career field.'70

Questions of strategic validity notwithstanding, CYBERCOM's new doctrine
is instrumentally useful for enhancing bureaucratic identity, control,
autonomy, and resources. A supposed technological imperative to 'defend
forward' in the 'cyber domain' provides an intellectual justification
for a military organization like CYBERCOM to do what is inclined to do
anyway, namely conduct autonomous offensive operations to create
strategic effects. [Proactive campaigning to **influence** or
**disrupt** the **adversary's networks** is consistent with the
**offensive warrior ethos** of military institutions]{.underline}.
Offensive operations, rather than reactive defense, also enables
CYBERCOM to assert control in a highly uncertain environment.
[**[Expanded authorities]{.mark}** for **peacetime operations**
[provide]{.mark} **some [autonomy]{.mark}** [from **other
services**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as the intelligence community.
To 'man, train, and equip' the cyber mission forces that will implement
the new doctrine, finally, [[CYBERCOM needs]{.mark} **plans**, [**budget
allocations**, and]{.mark} **personnel**]{.underline}. It is also
helpful to use the same language that other military commands use to
explain how and why cyber warriors should be included in joint task
forces.

A crowded house [CYBERCOM needs]{.underline} to do two things [[to
persuade]{.mark} decisionmakers throughout [the
**D**]{.mark}]{.underline}epartment **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f
**[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense [[and the **Executive and Legislative
branches** to provide the **authorities**]{.mark} **and resources** [it
needs to pursue its **preferred**]{.mark} **course of
[action]{.mark}**]{.underline}. First, [[CYBERCOM]{.mark} needs to make
itself **comparable** to **other services** by arguing that it performs
familiar categories of military operations]{.underline} -- command,
intelligence, fire, maneuver, protection, sustainment -- in a
warfighting domain just like other military services. Second, [it
[must]{.mark} also [distinguish itself from]{.mark}]{.underline} its
former homes in U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) and [[the]{.mark}
National Security Agency (**[NSA]{.mark}**)]{.underline}, as well as
superficially similar organizations like U.S. Special Operations Command
(SOCOM).

CYBERCOM was formally created in 2010 as a sub-unified command under
STRATCOM and became a fully-fledged unified military command in 2018. It
incorporated elements that had previously functioned under STRATCOM such
as, on the offensive side, Joint Functional Component Command for
Network Warfare, and on defense, Joint Task Force Global Network
Operations.71 CYBERCOM's defensive mission also overlaps with the
network administrators at the Defense Information Systems Agency and the
cryptographers at the NSA Central Security Service. As of early 2019,
CYBERCOM had a full-time staff of '1,520 military and civilians, plus
contractors' together with '4,406 Service members and civilians in our
Cyber Mission Force.'72

The service components each brought distinct organizational cultures and
institutional histories to CYBERCOM.73 The Air Force articulated an
early vision of cyber power as strategic airpower but then struggled to
find its cyber warriors a permanent home, resulting in a split between
the air intelligence and cyber communities. Army cyber personnel were
initially split across different branch baronies before being
consolidated in Army Cyber Command, which had a notably more tactical
focus, with some friction between the military intelligence and signals
(network administration) communities. The Navy approach to cyber was
dominated by cryptologists, who enjoyed a long and close working
relationship with NSA, under the umbrella of a vague new construct of
maritime information dominance. With so much institutional diversity in
its ranks, [[CYBERCOM has]{.mark} **strong
[incentives]{.mark}**]{.underline} to articulate common doctrinal
concepts [[to **coordinate and control** other]{.mark} [organizations'
resources]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Nonetheless, [a **divorce**]{.underline} of this kind [is the
**wrong**]{.underline} long-term [solution]{.underline} for both
agencies and for the nation. [Cutting up]{.underline} what's known as
[the **"dual hat"**]{.underline} --- an arrangement under which the same
leader runs both Cyber Command and the NSA --- [**fragments** American
"defend forward" capabilities]{.underline} when the nation needs them to
be integrated the most. [These capabilities allow **Cyber
Com**]{.underline}mand in particular [to operate outside of formal
military networks to disrupt **malicious attacks**]{.underline} at their
sources, [and are **deeply dependent** on the **closely combined**
skills]{.underline} of both organizations. [The proposal risks
reigniting **turf battles**]{.underline} between the intelligence and
operations arms of the secretary of defense and mistakes the intertwined
relationship between defense and offense in cybered conflict. Instead of
simplistic organizational surgery, therefore, what's needed is a
longer-term plan incorporating Cyber Command and, especially, the
capabilities of the National Security Agency into a resilient and
adaptive whole-of-society cyber defense system.

Reasons to Avoid Recreating Silos

Reason 1: Scale of Adversaries

First, [the scale of **adversary cyber threats** is
**unprecedented**]{.underline}, prompting cyber commands not only in the
United States but elsewhere to expand budgets and personnel. The latest
attack, the so-called SolarWinds campaign, is only one of a legion of
campaigns attacking the nation as well as its allies. The massive volume
of systemic assaults against the United States and allies requires a
matching scale of coordinated units with integrated knowledge and
capability for action. **[Cybered conflict]{.underline}** today involves
countering adversaries that are operating at a scale and with a reach
that [is already **overwhelming**]{.underline} to the combined size of
the dual-hatted unit, other federal civilian cyber entities, and the
huge commercial cyber security community of the United States. Scale is
needed to defeat scale when the battlefield is the interconnected
cyberspace substrate underlying all modern national
socio-technical-economic systems. [**Separating** the **two
organizations** means withdrawing the huge intelligence agency's
**knowledge-generating** and **cyber security** assets back
to]{.underline} [more traditional]{.underline} strategic national
[intelligence]{.underline} and defensive information-assurance missions,
[and away from]{.underline} the more **[offense-oriented]{.underline}**
but smaller [Cyber Com]{.underline}mand. There is already a national
shortage of people with advanced computer skills. These folks are now
shared relatively readily between the joined organizations. [A split
would increase]{.underline} the [competition for]{.underline} such
**[talented employees]{.underline}** just when collectively employing
the limited set of "wizards" efficiently is essential.
[Splitting]{.underline} the dual-hat arrangement further [weakens an
**already**]{.underline} too small and **[fragmented]{.underline}** U.S.
national effort in [cyber defense]{.underline}.

Reason 2: Speed in Trade-Off Decisions

Second, [the split]{.underline} is likely to [hand the **speed
advantage** to **adversaries**. Unity of command]{.underline} has long
been taken for granted as [key to a faster decision]{.underline} in a
crisis, even given the size of the organization. [Having a **single**
leader is even more important]{.underline} in cybered conflict, where
offense and defense are inextricably linked, [and]{.underline} the
guidance of [a **shared boss** helps ensure more speedy **trade-off
decisions**]{.underline}. Weapons in [cyber operations need]{.underline}
to be tailored to cybered targets in ways more traditional weapons do
not. That tailoring requires [**careful**, **highly responsive** timing
and constantly refreshed intelligence]{.underline}. Cyber defense
requires a more in-depth understanding of corresponding offensive tools
and operations than is required in conventional military forces.
Executing cyber offense requires a similar knowledge of cyber defense.
Exquisitely detailed intelligence therefore becomes exceptionally
important to knowing whether the cyber tools have any discernible
offense and defense effects, let alone those desired.

Having the two organizations share the same person as commander in the
dual hat is far from what later critics might explain as a convenient,
short-term nurturing arrangement for the infant Cyber Command. Rather,
it is intended to achieve a longstanding military desire of having close
and effective --- and therefore accurate and rapid --- integration of
intelligence and operations. With a dual-hat arrangement, the single
individual at the head of Cyber Command and the NSA can more effectively
and quickly tailor demand signals to both planners and developers about
the intelligence needs of operations against specific targets.
[**Suboptimal** speed in]{.underline} trade-off [**decision-making**
is]{.underline} certainly [more likely if there are two]{.underline}
peer organizational [leaders]{.underline} viewing themselves as having
two different missions.

Reason 3: Synergy in Innovative Shared Operations

Third, [separating intelligence]{.underline} from operations as it was
before the dual-hat arrangement [cedes a **critical** **synergy
advantage** to adversaries]{.underline}. In all conflict, [having
knowledge **in advance** is **key to success**]{.underline}, resilience,
[and **innovation** around **future threats**]{.underline}, and it is
often found by accidental exchanges among colleagues or peers routinely
working with each other. Unexpected **[info]{.underline}**rmation
discoveries [would be **less readily shared** if the two organizations
split]{.underline}. Cyber Command's operational interests would no
longer be prominent in the intelligence analysts' chain of command or
field of view. The traditional distinctions between operations and
intelligence concerns are likely to return, with less frequent shared
daily practices marking the current operational teams.

To be clear, it is much easier to decouple two organizations than to
integrate them --- to destroy synergy than to create it. The evolution
of a more integrated understanding of cyber operational needs has been a
long, hard-fought success so far, and it is not guaranteed to survive a
separation. There are always voices in favor of decoupling, irrespective
of the overarching benefits. For example, an NSA colleague remarked in a
private conversation several years ago that they thought the
intelligence agency itself was becoming too "military" in its
organization and short-term in its thinking under the dual-hat
arrangement. Similarly, in 2016 the executive director of U.S. Cyber
Command was quoted as saying, "As the United States Cyber Command, we
need totally separate tools and infrastructure to conduct our
operations." If the organizations split, these opinions may gain more
adherents and dominate collective efforts. The turf-reinforced
bureaucratic divisions would return and the commonality of understanding
developed over the past 10 years would wither. So would the spontaneous
support in ideas, sacrifice, additional time, and innovative action. If
the organizations are separated, [the **consequences** are likely to be
**less agile**]{.underline}, intuited, [and **innovative** cyber
operations]{.underline} in both organizations.

#### Rapid [response]{.underline} and [info-transmission]{.underline} avoid cyberattacks on [NC3]{.underline} systems\-\--those go [nuclear]{.underline}.

These links exist because [the **NC3** systems of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and other nuclear-armed states
[are]{.underline} heavily [**dependent** on **computers**]{.underline}
and other digital processors [for]{.underline} virtually [**every
aspect** of their operation]{.underline} and because [those systems are
**highly vulnerable** to cyberattack]{.underline}. [Every nuclear force
is composed]{.underline}, most basically, [of]{.underline} weapons,
early-warning radars, launch facilities, and the top officials, usually
presidents or prime ministers, empowered to initiate a nuclear exchange.
Connecting them all, however, is [an extended network of
**communications** and **data-processing systems**]{.underline}, all
[reliant on **cyberspace**]{.underline}. [Warning systems]{.underline},
ground- and space-based, [must **constantly** watch for]{.underline} and
analyze possible enemy [missile launches. Data]{.underline} on actual
threats [must **rapidly** be communicated]{.underline} to
decision-makers, [who must]{.underline} then [weigh **possible
responses** and communicate **chosen outcomes**]{.underline} to launch
facilities, which in turn must provide attack vectors to delivery
systems. All of this involves operations in cyberspace, and it is in
this domain that great power rivals seek vulnerabilities to exploit in a
constant struggle for advantage.

The use of cyberspace to gain an advantage over adversaries takes many
forms and is not always aimed at nuclear systems. [China]{.underline}
has been accused of [engag]{.underline}ing [in **widespread
cyberespionage** to steal **technical secrets** from **U.S.
firms**]{.underline} for economic and military advantages.
[Russia]{.underline} has been accused, most extensively in the Robert
Mueller report, of exploiting cyberspace to [**interfere** in
the]{.underline} 2016 U.S. presidential [election]{.underline}. Nonstate
actors, including [terrorist groups such as **al Qaeda**
and]{.underline} the **[I]{.underline}**slamic **[S]{.underline}**tate
group, have [used the internet for **recruiting**]{.underline}
combatants [and **spreading fear**. Criminal groups]{.underline},
including some thought to be allied with state actors, such as North
Korea, have used cyberspace to [**extort money** from
banks]{.underline}, municipalities, [and individuals]{.underline}.4
Attacks such as these occupy most of the time and attention of civilian
and military cybersecurity organizations that attempt to thwart such
attacks. Yet [for those who worry about]{.underline} strategic stability
and the risks of [**nuclear escalation**, it is the threat of
cyberattacks on **NC3 systems** that provokes the **greatest
concern**]{.underline}.

Russia are conducting sustained cybercampaigns against the United
States. (Photo: Mark Wilson/Getty Images)This concern stems from the
fact that, [despite the **immense** effort devoted to protecting
NC3]{.underline} systems [from cyberattack, no enterprise that relies
**so extensively** on **computers**]{.underline} and cyberspace [can be
made **100 percent invulnerable**]{.underline} to attack. This is so
because [such systems employ many]{.underline} devices and **[operating
systems]{.underline}** of various origins and vintages, most
incorporating numerous software updates and "patches" over time,
[offering **multiple vectors** for **attack**]{.underline}. Electronic
[components can also be modified by **hostile actors** during
**production**]{.underline}, transit, [or **insertion**; and the **whole
system**]{.underline} itself [is dependent]{.underline} to a
considerable degree [on the **electrical grid**, which]{.underline}
itself [is **vulnerable**]{.underline} to cyberattack and is far less
protected. Experienced "cyberwarriors" of every major power have been
working for years to probe for weaknesses in these systems and in many
cases have devised cyberweapons, typically, malicious software (malware)
and computer viruses, to exploit those weaknesses for military
advantage.5

Although activity in cyberspace is much more difficult to detect and
track than conventional military operations, enough information has
become public to indicate that [the **major nuclear
powers**]{.underline}, notably China, Russia, and the United States,
along with such secondary powers as Iran and North Korea, have
[established **extensive** cyberwarfare capabilities and engage in
**offensive cyberoperations**]{.underline} on a regular basis, often
[aimed at **critical military infrastructure**]{.underline}. "Cyberspace
is a contested environment where we are in constant contact with
adversaries," General Paul M. Nakasone, commander of the U.S. Cyber
Command (Cybercom), told the Senate Armed Services Committee in February
2019. "We see **[near-peer competitors]{.underline}** \[China and
Russia\] conducting sustained campaigns below the level of armed
conflict to [erode **American strength** and gain **strategic
advantage**]{.underline}."

[When separate **authority stovepipes** intersect]{.underline} but
values conflict, [cooperation is **challenging**]{.underline}, even in
the context of shared missions.43 In these circumstances, outside
intervention is required to determine which organization is actually in
charge. For example, in the traditional nuclear community---which not
only includes the military services and Strategic Command but also the
Department of Energy (DOE)---policymakers established the Nuclear
Weapons Council.44 The authorities and responsibilities for council
participants are specified by law, policy, and memorandums of agreement
between DOD and DOE.45 Without a similar governance structure or single
authority capable of compelling interorganizational change, it seems
unlikely that DOD's separate space or cyber institutions will poactively
declassify any capabilities, even those which might help deter attacks
on NC3.46

Separate authority stovepipes may also create barriers to employing
offensive weapons. For example, [if an **adversary** attacks the **NC3
architecture** in the **cyber domain**]{.underline}, and DOD does not
wish to retaliate using a nuclear weapon,47 [which]{.underline}
combatant [command is **in charge** of the **response**]{.underline},
Strategic or Cyber Command? DOD's cyber doctrine specifies that Cyber
Command's role vis-à-vis the other combatant commands varies as a
function of whether operations are local or global.48 Furthermore, it
states that the support/supporting relationships between commands are
established on a by-mission basis.49 These public statements, of course,
leave the unanswered the question of which combatant command---Cyber or
Strategic Command---is in charge of non-nuclear responses to
cyberattacks on NC3.

Furthermore, what happens [if attacks **cross domains**?
How]{.underline} then [should DOD integrate]{.underline} three
**[separate authority stovepipes]{.underline}**---in the Strategic,
Space, and Cyber Commands---to effectively and efficiently respond? [If
DOD is to **credibly threaten** any response to]{.underline} space or
[**cyber-based attacks** on NC3, these basic **unity of command**
questions deserve answers]{.underline}.50 To date, however, Vice
Chairman John Hyten admits that DOD has not sufficiently addressed these
questions, noting: "We just decided that we'd call each other combatant
commands, and not put an adjective on the front."51 By failing to
specify a critically important adjective---whether a command is
supporting or supported---DOD leaves unanswered the question of who is
in charge when attacks cross domains.

How [**Cyberspace** Is Creating **Nuclear Risks**]{.underline}

Policymakers and academics are attuned to the cyber risks to nuclear
command and control. The practitioner community has largely focused on
U.S. vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them. Scholars, in turn, worry
about how cyber operations could have unintended escalatory
consequences. But less attention has been paid to another likely
scenario: the use of cyber operations for signaling purposes (operations
with visible effects that aim to convey a message to another state) in a
nuclear context. The ambiguity of cyber operations can sometimes be
useful for signaling --- but the same ambiguity can be dangerous during
a nuclear crisis. The problem is that civilian leaders in particular,
distinct from the military, are inclined to see cyber attacks as
effective signaling tools.

Cyber operations could have nuclear implications, especially because
[**modern** nuclear command and control **systems**]{.underline}, like
those [in]{.underline} Russia and [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [are becoming **increasingly dependent** on
**digital infrastructure**]{.underline}. Nuclear command, control, and
communications systems, which include [early warning,
info]{.underline}rmation [collection, and communications]{.underline}
capabilities, alert decision-makers to impending nuclear strikes and
also enable leaders to control decisions about nuclear use (or non-use).
But their [digital dependencies are creating **opportunities** for
**exploitation** using **cyber means**]{.underline}. In a 2020 report,
the Nuclear Threat Initiative found that "almost [**9 out of 10**
planned **nuclear modernization programs** involve]{.underline} at least
some new [digital components]{.underline} or upgrades."

Vulnerabilities inherent in the digital infrastructure that undergird
modern nuclear systems provide opportunities for actors to engage in
cyber espionage --- gaining access to a network or system to steal
information --- or even conduct cyber attacks. Hypothetically, a cyber
power like Russia could conduct a cyber attack against a U.S. early
warning satellite to degrade its functionality. This has become an
urgent concern for practitioners. U.S. Strategic Command, for instance,
is currently working to "operationally harden NC3 systems against cyber
threats." Congress has also gotten involved, requiring the Defense
Department to evaluate the cybersecurity of major weapon systems. And
the Government Accountability Office has published multiple reports
decrying the state of cybersecurity and scope of vulnerabilities of
weapon systems, including elements of the nuclear triad.

From an academic perspective, scholars have investigated how cyber
operations targeting nuclear systems could exacerbate escalation risks.
Focusing on nuclear forces, [**early** research]{.underline}, such as
work by Martin Libicki, [was **skeptical of the dangers**]{.underline}
posed by cyber operations. [**Nuclear forces** were seen as]{.underline}
being largely immune from digital attacks because they were "**[air
gapped]{.underline}**," meaning that they were separated from
information technology systems.

[However]{.underline}, as [**nuclear systems** have become
**increasingly intertwined** with the **digital
environment**]{.underline} --- not to mention the dual-use nature of
many elements of nuclear command, control, and communications systems
(like early warning or position, navigation, and timing satellites) ---
the protection offered by being segregated from the internet is less
robust. Jacquelyn Schneider, Benjamin Schechter, and Rachael Schaffer,
for instance, ran a series of wargames demonstrating that
**[decision-makers]{.underline}** in hypothetical crises [are **likely**
to use their **cyber exploits** against an adversary's **nuclear
systems**]{.underline}. They found that this could have negative effects
on states' respective nuclear strategies, especially decisions to
pre-delegate nuclear launch authority or automate nuclear responses.
Erik Gartzke and Jon Lindsay argue that the clandestine nature of cyber
operations means that [one state could **secretly gain
access**]{.underline} to an adversary's [nuclear]{.underline} command,
control, and communications [systems]{.underline}, giving the former an
information advantage or even [creating an incentive]{.underline} for
the latter [to **use its nuclear weapons** out of the fear that it may
**lose them**]{.underline}. James Acton notes that the difficulties of
distinguishing between cyber espionage and attack could lead a state to
misperceive the intent behind a cyber operation, generating a similar
"use it or lose it" calculus.

opposite is true. [**Increased automation** and **connectivity**

Parallel to these efforts, the National Security Council and U.S. Cyber
Command are rescinding and replacing Presidential Policy Directive 20,
an Obama-era policy framework governing offensive cyber operations.
According to Politico, "in rescinding PPD-20, \[President\] Trump put
cyberattacks on the same level as kinetic operations, which do not
require high-level approval or interagency discussions." In theory, this
change empowers [[Cyber Com]{.mark}mand]{.underline} to [conduct
**short-notice [attacks]{.mark}** [without]{.mark} **White House
[approval]{.mark}** [or **interagency coordination**]{.mark}. Seen [in
the context of **ci**]{.mark}**vil-[m]{.mark}ilitary
[r]{.mark}elations**, this shift [assumes]{.mark}]{.underline} positive
[objective control: [a]{.mark}]{.underline} professional [**military
[cyber force]{.mark}** capable of [**autonomously** protecting society
absent]{.mark} constant **[civilian oversight]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Under the Obama administration, offensive cyber operations required
extensive interagency vetting and executive approval, similar to what
Samuel Huntington called subjective control. In an article for the
Washington Post, reporter Ellen Nakashima quoted the State Department's
former cyber coordinator on the [need to **balance**]{.underline} the
desire for [**offensive cyber operations** with]{.underline} " 'other
national equities' ... to ensure that a cyber operation does not
compromise **[intelligence collection]{.underline}**, law enforcement
investigations and diplomatic relations." Multiple officials complained
this interagency staffing process slowed or stalled cyber operations as
officials struggled to get buy-in from different stakeholders.
Subjective control reduced the efficacy of cyber operations.

Balancing Equities: Cyber Operations Meet Bureaucratic Politics

At its core, [the debate]{.underline} about Presidential Policy
Directive 20 [concerns the distinctions]{.underline} in U.S. legal code
[between **traditional military activity** (governed by **Title 10**)
and **covert action** (governed by **Title 50**)]{.underline} as well as
the diplomatic risks and legal challenges triggered by cyber operations.
There are real questions concerning where to draw the line between the
world of soldiers (i.e., Title 10) and the world of spies (i.e., Title
50). [How **civilian leaders** draw this line]{.underline} and exert
control over the foreign policy process [amplifies]{.underline}
bureaucratic interests and **[competition for resources]{.underline}**
at the commanding heights of government.

There are few clear distinctions between soldiers and spies in cyber
space given the rapid rate at which adversary capabilities and
tradecraft --- often deliberately deployed to thwart response ---
evolve. There is a reason why Russian military intelligence leased
servers in Arizona while targeting the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Placing data on servers in the United States made it difficult for
American intelligence and military agencies to respond.

Beyond bureaucratic intrigue, key interagency stakeholders maintain
competing theories of victory for cyber strategy. To date, cyber space
has been a world of spies where espionage, covert action, and sabotage
--- not conventional military operations --- play the dominant role.
From sabotaging Iranian centrifuges to high-profile espionage
operations, U.S. strategy since 2000 reflects classical political
warfare optimized for new technology. This theory of victory lends
itself to subjective control. Covert action, as Americans have
unfortunately learned all too often, requires extensive civilian
oversight.

As more military resources and personnel align with cyber missions,
[[there are]{.mark} **growing [calls]{.mark}** [for a]{.mark}
**forward-leaning [posture]{.mark}** [focused **less** on
**intel**]{.mark}**ligence**]{.underline} and more on seizing the
digital high ground. [In [this]{.mark} theory]{.underline} of victory,
[cyber [strategy is not just]{.mark} a **world of [spies]{.mark}**[,
but]{.mark}]{.underline} more akin to traditional **[[military
strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Since Americans' social lives, consumer
habits, and precision munitions all rely on global connectivity,
defending U.S. core interests requires allowing soldiers to safeguard
digital infrastructure absent civilian oversight or extensive
interagency coordination.

Just as Alfred Thayer Mahan looked at the intersection of economics and
military power to advocate securing sea lines of communication, the next
generation is likely to see soldiers securing network society. In place
of battleships and dreadnoughts, the new theory of victory sees a vital
role for cyber military options countering hostile intrusion campaigns
targeting U.S. and allied critical infrastructure and key intellectual
property interests. Soldiers, not spies, become the main effort.

Cyber Command has floated the idea that the contemporary cyber
environment is marked by persistent engagement --- a near-constant state
of pressure against key aspects of American national power by adaptive
adversaries who tailor sustained, long-term campaigns precisely to avoid
triggering a response by the U.S. government. This idea parallels the
concept of "contact" in the 2018 National Defense Strategy. Contact is
the gray zone, a layer of defense in which the United States, including
the Department of Defense, competes with adversaries beneath the level
of armed conflict. As a cyber extension of this concept, persistent
engagement is vital for understanding how, and why, Obama-era policy
mechanisms for responding to hostile acts in cyber space are changing.
Soldiers, not just spies, secure U.S. economic and military interests
along global networks.

The Obama-era Presidential Policy Directive 20 sought to establish
subjective civilian control and create a political framework balancing
political warfare and persistent engagement. The process acknowledged
that soldiers and spies, as well as diplomats and law enforcement
personnel, all have a seat at the table. For example, a high-profile
hack back against a country tampering with elections or stealing
intellectual property from leading U.S. businesses carries reputational
risk (i.e., what if the hack fails or unintentionally hits U.S.
citizens) and diplomatic consequences. Government agencies best placed
to discuss these issues had a seat at the table under the Obama-era
framework. Yet, this interagency de-confliction process suffered from
delays, bureaucratic inertia, ill-defined decision pathways, and the
lack of a clear "referee" to resolve competing positions at the working
level.

As a result of such weaknesses, the prior version of the directive can
be seen as at times failing to serve its intended purpose --- with major
stakeholders frequently if not exclusively seeking to pursue mission
objectives under other standing processes governed by separate
authorities. Consistent with Huntington's characterization of subjective
control, this bureaucratic quagmire likely affected cyber responses.
Civilian oversight and interagency coordination mechanisms produced
delays and, in all likelihood, diminished options for responding to
time-sensitive crisis events.

Furthermore, the process amplified rather than diminished bureaucratic
competition. Bureaucratic struggles at the heart of the policy process
surrounding national security decision-making can lead to wayward
soldiers assuming more risk than civilians are often willing to accept
in a crisis. Alternatively, when intelligence considerations are given
primacy a procedural bias often emerges against actions that would
result in a loss of collection visibility. Spies want to keep reporting,
not jeopardize their placement and access. While such access is
essential for providing warnings about future threats, potential
intelligence loss considerations must be weighed against the operational
impact of adversary action on victim organizations. Soldiers want to
safeguard key terrain and are reluctant to cede ground to enable spies.
These arguments play out against a backdrop of diplomatic concerns,
where advocacy for the perspectives of third-party states often results
in avoiding counteroffensive operations in favor of law enforcement or
administrative remediation measures.

New Threats: The Changing Character of Cyber Operations

A changing threat environment further complicates finding the right
policy framework for ensuring civilian oversight of cyber operations and
balancing competing stakeholders. The majority of cyber operations since
2000 are best classified as 21st century political warfare. Rival states
used disruption, espionage, and degradation to undermine their
adversaries and signal the risk of escalation. In this digital gray
zone, cyber operations provided a low-cost, low-threat means of engaging
in competition short of violent conflict. These operations were often
related to larger influence campaigns, such as Russian efforts to target
the 2016 U.S. presidential election and undermine democratic
institutions in Western Europe.

While the utility of cyber operations for great powers and emerging
players to date has largely been driven by the logic of political
warfare, the ongoing evolution of capabilities strongly suggests
different intentions. For example, ongoing warnings of Russian
penetration of U.S. critical infrastructure provide early indications of
hostile operational preparation of the environment. Russia is using
cyber intrusions to signal the risk of escalation in a crisis and gain a
position of advantage in the event of a militarized dispute. Future
meetings in the situation room during a tense standoff will involve more
than identifying Russia's nuclear force. Analysts will need a better
understanding of Russian cyber posture and the risk of unknown exploits
emerging in key systems like power grids and cellular networks ---
capabilities Russia demonstrated in the live-fire "battle lab" of
Ukraine.

In this scenario, who responds: soldiers or spies? Even more
importantly, what is the civil-military context in which they respond:
objective or subjective control? At stake is not just an optimal policy
process, but the stability of a connected world. Leaving the planning to
any single group produces bureaucratic pathologies that risk inadvertent
escalation.

The Risks of Soldiers Left Unchecked

[Insights from the literature on
**[c]{.mark}**]{.underline}ivil-**[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**ilitary
**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**elations and planning [[suggest not leaving
cyber]{.mark} strategy [to **soldiers**]{.mark} **alone**.
[Military]{.mark} planning]{.underline} in isolation historically tends
to [[produce]{.mark} **narrow [plans]{.mark}** [prone to]{.mark}
**worst-case [biasing]{.mark}** [and **escalation**]{.mark} **risks**.
Risa [Brooks demonstrates the importance of
**info**]{.mark}]{.underline}rmation [[**sharing** and]{.mark}
**strategic [coordination]{.mark}**]{.underline} in her work on
civil-military relations and strategic planning. There are real
distributional conflicts in domestic institutions that affect strategic
assessments and planning. [When [military actors]{.mark} are
**isolated**, they]{.underline} tend to [**[safeguard
info]{.mark}rmation** to gain a **bargaining advantage** [and **capture
resources**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In his work on military planning on
the eve of World War I, Jack Snyder finds that [insular **military
organizations** are prone to a **cult of the offensive**, [exaggerating
**gains** to ensure]{.mark} their **bureaucratic
[autonomy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [small groups of soldiers
engaged in **classified planning** are prone to **cognitive
bias**]{.underline}, including false optimism, overconfidence, and an
implemental mindset that closes them off to new information.

The second fatal flaw of [[leaving cyber]{.mark} space [to]{.mark} the
[soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline} is that it [**[diminishes]{.mark} the
probability** of **successful**, **coercive
[diplomacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Cyber security scholars increasingly
describe the domain in terms of coercion. States, and other interest
groups, use cyber operations to coerce rivals. This diplomacy of
violence, to use Thomas Schelling's famous phrase, is designed to change
behavior short of war. Seen as coercive diplomacy, this implies
combining multiple instruments of power --- such as military threats,
economic sanctions, and diplomatic outreach --- [to change the
**cost-benefit calculation** of the rival]{.underline}.

In fact, research suggests that the majority of political concessions
produced by or linked to cyber operations involve other instruments of
power. The campaign against Iran involved not just cyber espionage and
degradation operations, but a concurrent threat of military pressure and
economic sanctions alongside the promise of future trade deals and
reintegration into the global community if Iran signed a nuclear deal.
Real strategy, like combined arms, involves combining different ways and
means to achieve objective ends. Furthermore, this coordination requires
civilian oversight and subjective control. Consistent with agency
theory, both soldiers and spies need to know civilians are monitoring
them and willing to punish officials who cross the line.

Striking the Right Balance

Developing [American **[cyber strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline} starts
with getting the policy framework right and ensuring civilian oversight.
This framework [[must empower **interagency planning**]{.mark} that
generates response options leveraging **multiple** **instruments of
power**]{.underline}. These plans should address the possibility of
time-sensitive crises involving defensive cyber fires intended to target
hostile intrusion and/or computer network attack infrastructure while
balancing competing equities between soldiers and spies alongside
diplomats and law enforcement officials. In coordinating a response,
[the plans]{.underline} --- which [should be [**monitored** by
**civilians**]{.mark}]{.underline}, including Congress --- must
reconcile interagency conflict before they reach the Oval Office or
situation room. Much like major war plans in the Department of Defense,
these contingency plans should be periodically reassessed, to include
war games and crisis simulations, and approved by appointed civilian
officials. This review process has the added benefit of identifying
critical vulnerabilities and requirements for new capabilities and
partnerships that maintain America's advantages in cyber space.

[Consider the following example. **[Cyber Com]{.mark}**]{.underline}mand
and the intelligence community [[identify **intrusion**]{.mark}
**attempts** targeting **critical infrastructure**]{.underline} in the
United States. [Initial assessments [attribute the incident to
**Russia**]{.mark} but **cannot determine** whether the incident is
espionage]{.underline} or an attempt to insert payloads for use in
future crises. Worse still, the incident takes place during a large
Russian military exercise.

[**Objective control** would imply the military]{.underline} is
authorized to respond against the worst-case scenario and not only
counterattack the point of origin of the attacks but potentially
[[unleash a barrage of **cyber**]{.underline}]{.mark} degradation
[**[op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}** [against Russian **command and
control**]{.mark} **facilities**]{.underline}. In the best case, the
counterattack only heightens diplomatic tension and burns multiple
covert, cyber espionage campaigns. In the worst, case [[it
unleashes]{.underline}]{.mark} a cyber Able Archer, the 1983 training
exercise that some argue almost triggered **[[World War
III]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[[Civil-military relationships]{.underline}]{.mark} are not an end in
themselves. These relationships [exist only to [provide
effective]{.mark} national [security policies]{.mark} in a given
geopolitical environment]{.underline} in the context of democratic
accountability. Unfortunately, [the environment is **not benign**. As
they sort through the civil-military and institutional
baggage]{.underline} --- the items they bring with them and the items
they inherit --- [[Biden's team must]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[navigate]{.mark} **intensified [great-power conflict]{.mark}**,
persistent [instability in the]{.mark} broader [Middle East, **strained
ties with**]{.mark} **key [allies]{.mark}**, and little progress on all
of the other]{.underline} stubborn [problems that have bedeviled leaders
in the post-Cold War era, including: the **[prolif]{.mark}eration** [of
**w**]{.mark}]{.underline}eapons of **[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**ass
**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**estruction, [transnational networks of
[**terrorism**, **failed states**]{.mark}, and **[ethnic
rivalries]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And, of course, [Biden must still lead
the country out of [the]{.mark} worst [pandemic]{.mark} in a century
while recovering from all of the associated [economic upheaval. There
will be **no strategic holiday**]{.mark} during which the [Biden]{.mark}
team can painstakingly sort through its civil-military
affairs]{.underline}.

[The new commander-in-chief [starts with]{.mark} the enormous [advantage
of being "**not Trump**." He will need **all**]{.mark} **of [that
advantage]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [and]{.underline} will need [to
have learned from Obama-era missteps]{.underline} --- in order [[to
navigate]{.mark} through the [tricky civil-military
waters]{.mark}]{.underline} we have described above. Members of the
Biden team come in as seasoned professionals, but [[we hope that
leads]{.mark} them [to]{.mark} caution and [humility rather than]{.mark}
unwariness and **[hubris as they conduct]{.mark} national [security
policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If Lloyd Austin wins over the critics and
proves himself to be both fully sensitive to these civil-military
realities and savvy in how he seeks to overcome them, he may yet emerge
as the successful and strong secretary of defense the Department of
Defense so desperately needs. The [early slate of civilian nominees
named for key roles is a welcome sign]{.underline}. The initial weeks
after the inauguration will be of particular importance in setting the
tone, especially after the tumultuous and stressful transition. Even so,
the norm of civilian management of the Defense Department will be more
difficult to reestablish, like so many other civil-military norms that
have weakened in recent years, if Congress does grant another
recently-retired general legal permission to serve as secretary of
defense. Biden, and Austin, will need all the top civilian defense
talent they can get.

Notwithstanding all of the other urgent priorities vying for his
attention, [[neglect of the civil-military file]{.mark}
would]{.underline} likely [[impose **intolerable
costs**]{.underline}]{.mark} on Biden **[down the road]{.underline}**
--- [a price that would be vividly evident]{.underline}, [**[sooner or
later, when a]{.mark}n urgent national security [crisis takes center
stage]{.mark}**. The only prudent course is]{.underline} for the Biden
team [to attend to both policy and process at the same time]{.underline}
--- to move out quickly on the pandemic and the economy,
[while]{.underline} also [setting the national security establishment on
the path to healthier civil-military relations. [Problems in]{.mark} the
**[civil-military foundations]{.mark}**]{.underline} of an
administration [[must be **fixed before a crisis**]{.mark} **lays bare
the rot that may lie just out of view**]{.underline}.

### Impact\-\--Militarization\-\--2NC

#### Military culture and cybersecurity are [incompatible]{.underline}\-\--meshing them risks [war]{.underline} AND public-private incongruity.

Jon R. **Lindsay 20**, assistant professor at the Munk School of Global
Affairs and Public Policy and the Department of Political Science at the
University of Toronto, 10/30/2020, "Cyber conflict vs. Cyber Command:
hidden dangers in the American military solution to a large-scale
intelligence problem," *Intelligence and National Security* 36(2),
https://doi.org/10.1080/02684527.2020.1840746, cc

At the same time, the institutional characteristics that make
**[[military org]{.mark}anization[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** so effective
at scaling up operations also [[raise]{.mark} serious
[concerns]{.mark}]{.underline} when the operations
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} question are [**[intelligence]{.mark}** and
**covert action**]{.underline}. These can be considered alongside the
same three characteristics that define intelligence itself.

First, **[intelligence is [deception]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The essence
of intelligence tradecraft is the abuse of trust to infiltrate the same
institutions and infrastructures that enable cooperation in the target
society. Whether secret vulnerabilities and accesses are leveraged to
collect or inject information is a secondary distinction. Defenders can
employ deception as well as attackers, which complicates and limits the
strategic effectiveness of intelligence by any means. This is all second
nature to intelligence professionals, but [the subversion of trust
[stands in]{.mark} **stark [tension]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} **martial
[ideals]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **open and heroic
[combat]{.mark}**]{.underline}, even as stratagem has a long history in
war. Feints and ambushes are one thing, but subversion and treachery are
quite another. It is understandable why a military organization might
resist thinking of itself as an intelligence organization, even setting
aside the subordinate or supporting connotation that intelligence
usually has in a military setting. CYBERCOM is an honorable military
organization, but intelligence is at its core a duplicitous business.
[[The mismatch]{.mark} between **military culture** and **intelligence
practice**]{.underline} is also likely to [[complicate CYBERCOM's
efforts to]{.mark} recruit]{.underline}, retain, and manage [the
**unconventional [hack]{.mark}ers** it needs]{.underline} to subvert the
most sophisticated trust networks humanity has ever constructed. This
all raises an important ethical question: should the same militaries
that openly man the ramparts also be digging through firewalls?

Second, **[intelligence is political]{.underline}**. Secret statecraft
is politically attractive because it promises to reduce the costs and
risks of pursuing contested policy goals. Militaries are also political,
of course, but in a very different way. Intelligence is organized
deception to gain an information advantage. Militaries are organized
force to gain a coercive advantage. Military forces can be employed to
win battlefield contests, brandished to threaten punishment, or deployed
to reassure allies. Intelligence, by contrast, is more preoccupied with
lowering policy costs and risks on the sly, rather than increasing power
and credibility in the open. [The **political logic** of
[intelligence]{.mark} stands in **stark [tension]{.mark}** [with]{.mark}
the **noisy confrontation of [battle]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} the
**deliberate signaling of [deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark} can be used to make war more
efficient in terms reducing force requirements while boosting
capabilities, of course, but this sometimes [comes at the
[expense]{.mark} of effectiveness in terms of [**power** and
**credibility**]{.mark}]{.underline}.87 [Increasing **military
reliance** on intelligence]{.underline} capabilities [in]{.underline}
space and [cyberspace]{.underline} is only [making these]{.underline}
'cross domain' [tradeoffs more difficult]{.underline}.88 [[The
tension]{.underline}]{.mark} between deceptive contestation and
strategic stability [[lies at the root of]{.underline}]{.mark}
contemporary [[concerns that CYBERCOM's]{.underline}]{.mark} doctrine of
[**'persistent [engagement']{.mark}** [will lead to]{.mark}
**inadvertent [escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.89

The relative prioritization of power, credibility, or efficiency in any
given situation is a profoundly political problem. Different leaders,
parties, and organizations, furthermore, can be expected to have
different opinions about the way it should be solved. The American
military has internalized strong professional norms of apolitical
service to the nation, of course, and CYBERCOM can be expected to carry
on this Huntingtonian tradition. Yet military professionalism can also
be leveraged for advantage in domestic politics, and it can distort
political assessment or oversight of military operations.90 CYBERCOM
will struggle to appear politically neutral in the very political
controversies that its subversive activities enable. In general, the
inherent political sensitivity of intelligence operations may not be a
good fit for military preferences for operational autonomy. Professional
intelligence agencies approach the problem of politicization
differently, with varying levels of success, by nurturing close
relationships with their political masters while hidden from the harsh
light of public politics.91 As CYBERCOM scales up intelligence
operations, whatever it decides to call them, this will likely
exacerbate the complexity and controversy of political tussles over
speech, privacy, and public safety, with CYBERCOM stuck in the middle.

Third, intelligence is increasingly civilian. One important implication
for cybersecurity is that 'cyberspace' as such does not exist. [Digital
networks are the **lifeblood** of governance, finance, trade, industry,
administration, and political activism]{.underline} in the twenty-first
century, and cyber operations work by, with, and through these networks.
Civilian firms build and operate most of the enabling infrastructure.
[Civilian cybersecurity firms play an important role in both
**offensive**]{.underline} collection [and]{.underline} influence and
**[defensive counterintelligence]{.underline}**, but their economic
interests may not always align with public cybersecurity.92 Civil
society actors, meanwhile, bear the brunt of much cyber conflict as the
targets of political surveillance, disinformation, and information
control. Cyber operations are deeply embedded within and constrained by
all this [civilian activity]{.underline}, but this [poses **serious
challenges** for **military culture**. Military organizations tend to
neglect]{.underline} or only grudgingly perform missions like
counterinsurgency and peacekeeping that require them to work by, with,
and through **[civilian populations]{.underline}**; militaries would
rather prepare for major combat operations that allow for greater
autonomy and are more consistent with warrior identities.93 Given that
military interventions to stabilize and rebuild nations have so often
proved controversial, how much more problematic are intelligence
operations to subvert and protect the digital infrastructure of civil
society itself? [Efforts to combat foreign disinformation campaigns are
**especially fraught** as they become]{.underline}, in effect,
[**military interventions** into **democratic** polities riven by
political disagreement]{.underline}.

### Impact\-\--Turf Wars\-\--2NC

#### Demchak says [splitting]{.underline} causes [turf wars]{.underline}.

#### Those deck law enforcement of [financial]{.underline} cybercrime.

Susan W. **Brenner 13**, NCR Distinguished Professor of Law and
Technology at the University of Dayton School of Law, "Cyber-threats and
the Limits of Bureaucratic Control", Minnesota Law Journal of Science &
Technology, Winter 2013, 14 Minn. J.L. Sci. & Tech. 137, Lexis

If these statutes parsed investigative authority out among the five
agencies listed above in a fashion analogous to how \[\*193\] combat
jurisdiction is parsed out among the five military branches, this would
go a long way toward reducing the [turf wars]{.underline} that currently
[**plague** federal **law enforcement**]{.underline}. Unfortunately, the
statutes rarely do this, which means agencies often have
**[[overlapping]{.underline}]{.mark}** investigative
**[[jurisdiction]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which [\"can [**open the
doors**\" to **turf battles**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a 2011
investigation of jurisdictional overlap among federal agencies, many
[agents]{.underline} reported that they had [encountered **uncertainty**
and **[disagreements]{.mark}** about the appropriate allocation
of]{.underline} investigative [authority]{.underline} and said these
[disagreements]{.underline} often [[negatively
**affect**]{.underline}]{.mark}ed [[investigations]{.mark}. Criminals\'
increasing [use of **cyberspace** is]{.mark} only [exacerbating]{.mark}
the [difficulties]{.mark} federal agents already face]{.underline}.

While turf wars and overlapping or **[[uncertain]{.underline}]{.mark}**
investigative **[[jurisdiction]{.underline}]{.mark}** continue to
[[impede]{.mark} U.S. law enforcement\'s **[ability to respond]{.mark}**
to crimes]{.underline}, they are not the only factors that are eroding
its ability to respond to cyber-threats. The problem law enforcement
must confront is the civilian correlate of the problem General Alexander
faces: we can no longer assume that attacks which appear to constitute
\"mere\" cybercrime are just that, i.e., are carried out by civilians
who are \"in\" the United States and whose motives are purely personal.
[[An attack on a **financial institution** might be]{.mark} a cybercrime
[committed]{.mark} by a greedy **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [citizen]{.underline} \"in\" the United States,
but it might, instead, be (i) a cybercrime committed by a non-United
States citizen operating from abroad or (ii) a cyber-sortie carried out
by a hostile nation-state\'s own cyber command.

III\. The Emergence of Cyber Crime

[In]{.underline} his [2013]{.underline} State of the Union address,
President Barack [Obama stated, on]{.underline} the topic of [cyber
security, that \"we cannot look back years from now and wonder why we
did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our
economy.\"]{.underline} It is now estimated that [cyber crime solicits
\$ 110 billion globally every year.]{.underline} The Federal Bureau of
Investigation recognizes three categories of cyber threats: organized
crime groups, state sponsors, and terrorist \[\*280\] groups. It is
organized crime groups and terrorist organizations that are susceptible
to RICO violations.

[[International organized]{.mark} criminal [syndicates use the Internet
in **furtherance** of]{.mark} more traditional **[real world
activities]{.mark}** like drug distribution and sex trafficking.
However, [they]{.mark} have also **[take]{.mark}**n [advantage
of]{.mark} the [digital]{.mark} world [to find]{.mark} new [**outlets**
for]{.mark} criminal activity including **mass [fraud]{.mark}** schemes,
**identity theft**, **online [banking crimes]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark}
**money [laundering]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Also,
[[groups]{.underline}]{.mark} composed of specialized criminals [have
[**evolved** to commit **all**]{.mark} of their [crimes
online]{.mark}]{.underline}. These groups differ from traditional
organized criminals because [they gain illicit profits **purely** via
computer]{.underline} and maintain no clearly defined structural
hierarchy. Nevertheless, their loose association in continual criminal
schemes fit the definition of an \"enterprise\" as defined in RICO.

These [specialized organized cyber crime groups employ new tools to
commit their acts. The [emergence of botnets]{.mark}, a network of
infected computers, [is **essential** to]{.mark} the
**[profitability]{.mark}** of the group]{.underline}. The botnet allows
for an attack on thousands of private users or corporate networks
instead of criminally infiltrating the systems on an individual basis.
Similarly, \"mules\" are essential to the vitality \[\*281\] of the
criminal enterprise. A \"mule\" is recruited for the sole purpose of
receiving the illicit funds, often via bank account, and turning these
funds into cash. Generally, mules receive small portions in monetary
value and are scattered across the globe so as not to endanger the
entire scheme if one is apprehended by law enforcement.

Public-Private Partnerships to Combat Illicit Trade and Illegal Economy\
[[The illegal economy poses an **existential threat**
when]{.underline}]{.mark} it begins to create [**criminalized
[markets]{.mark}** [and **captured states**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
[[launch]{.underline}]{.mark}es [[a downward]{.underline}]{.mark},
entropic [[spiral toward]{.mark} **greater [insecurity]{.mark}** [and
**instability**]{.mark}. In [countries]{.mark} that [have been
**corrupted**]{.mark} by **criminal networks**]{.underline}, market- and
state-building become less attainable, economic growth is stunted,
[efforts toward **[development]{.mark}** and poverty eradication [are
**stifled**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and foreign direct investment is
deterred.

The United States is supporting the OECD, the World Economic Forum
(WEF), and other international partners to provide knowledge-based
platforms for international public and private stakeholders to raise
awareness of the threat posed by illicit trade and illegal economy to
economic growth, development, and global security, and to share
experience on practical approaches to the control of illicit activities
as well as of the negative externalities of the illicit economy.
Engaging the public and private sectors through innovative
public-private partner-ships will be particularly important for securing
the integrity of the global supply chains and for ensuring long-term
sustainable licit commerce and productive markets.

The steep rise in mobility of goods, people, capital, and information
that has accompanied globalization is largely comprised of lawful and
beneficial exchanges, but an increasing share is illicit.
[**[Criminal]{.mark} entrepreneurs** and **illicit
[networks]{.mark}**]{.underline} sometimes use or exploit legitimate
businesses and legitimate global supply chains to carry out financial
frauds, industrial espio-nage, money laundering, and other illicit
activities. [Hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue from these
**activities flow through** the global economy every year, distorting
local economies, diminishing **legitimate business revenues**,

[Another challenge with **weapons systems** is ensuring that
**cybersecurity considerations** are implemented in the **earliest
phases** of **the acquisition cycle**]{.underline}, he said.

Protecting DOD\'s data is also a major challenge, he said.

[Understanding how **state** and **non-state adversaries**]{.underline}
are able to successfully [carry out cyberattacks is
important]{.underline}, he said. \"They learn over time in terms of what
they can do. They\'re not static in the terms of how they approach
cyberspace.\"

In about the past 150 days, [adversaries have]{.underline} successfully
[conducted **supply chain attacks**]{.underline}, particularly
ransomware attacks, he said. In the last several years, [**election
cybersecurity** has taken on an increasingly important
role]{.underline}.

[**Terrorist groups** are also mounting cyberattacks]{.underline}, he
said. In response, [the department has emphasized **close teamwork**
between the **NSA**, **Cybercom**]{.underline}, and other commands ---
U.S. Special Operations Command, in particular.

\"We learned how to work closely with U.S. Special Operations Command,
both to support their efforts against kinetic targets and to leverage
their capabilities against virtual ones,\" he said.

Nakasone also emphasized the importance of working with industry,
academia, interagency partners like the FBI and the Department of
Homeland Security, as well as with allies and partners.

[Having a **skilled** and **motivated** workforce is also **critically
important**]{.underline}, he said. [They need]{.underline} to have [the
**right training**]{.underline} and career paths and professional
development opportunities, and the DOD must be open to their new ideas.

Despite the sizeable literature dealing with the effects of exposure to
violence, few studies directly investigate the effects of exposure to
destructive cyberattacks. This is despite the growing recognition that
these threats have become a very tangible part of modern life. In a
complex scenario described in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the
International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, the authors contemplated
how [new]{.underline} forms of [**cyberattacks** could]{.underline} be
used to "acquire the credentials necessary to [access]{.underline} the

National Security Agency from Cyber Command have not yet been met and
that [the split will impact the **military's access** to **signals

One of the reporting series I recall was that which had to do with
[states]{.underline} which were [pursuing **nuclear weapons
programs**]{.underline}. There were quite a few of them in the 1980s and
1990s: Libya, South Africa, Taiwan, North Korea, India and Pakistan. As
we all know, only the last three have attained that capability (we'll
leave aside Israel for now: also, the so-called Permanent 5 UNSC members
-- the US, USSR/Russia/, the UK, France and the PRC -- already had 'the
bomb'). Then there is Iran....more on that in a bit.

Back then, there was no Internet. There was no easy way to keep tabs
openly on who was doing what. Thankfully, we had
**[SIGINT]{.underline}** to help us gain insight. Through the targeting,
collection, processing and analysis of communications (verbal, written,
imagery, telemetry, etc.) we [could see which countries were **making
progress**]{.underline} and suss out who were the key officials
(scientists, civil servants) with the keys to this breakthrough. We
learned a lot and were able to keep our political masters informed in
ways which would have been impossible without intelligence.

Wow, what a difference a couple of decades make!

A proliferation of information

Now we have so much more information at our fingertips: the World Wide
Web, social media platforms, even commercial imagery! As this recent
article in The Economist noted: "Non-governmental organisations
regularly unearth and publicise secret facilities using "open"
sources---most notably images taken by satellites like those which
researchers at MIIS (NB Middlebury Institute of International Studies)
used to spot North Korea's looming missile test and Saudi Arabia's
rocket plant."

In other words, [it is **hard**]{.underline}er today [to hide a
**nuclear weapons program**. This does not **obviate** the need for
**intelligence**]{.underline}: after all, there is nothing like a
highly-placed human source that can be tasked and directed [to find out
**specific information** to determine **exactly** what a **state's
intentions** are]{.underline}. And only states can actually take steps
to interfere with a nation's quest for nuclear weapons, even if those
steps are of dubious legality (hello assassination of Iranian nuclear
scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, probably by Mossad, Israel's foreign spy
service: oh wait, Israel surreptitiously developed their own nuke
capability didn't they?).

no longer [appears to be [from]{.mark} a large-scale

**[D]{.underline}**estruction technology, [and particularly]{.underline}
[the **combination** of nuclear]{.underline} and ballistic **[missile
capabilities]{.underline}** [to new actors]{.underline} [across the
globe]{.underline}. Ultimately, the central theme of the Second Nuclear
Age is that the spread of the bomb, along with the means to build and
deliver nuclear weapons, to new actors has changed the central dynamics
of the global nuclear order, and consequently we may no longer be able
to rely on the nuclear thinking and toolkit that helped us to survive
the First Nuclear Age. In the words of Fred Ikle, writing in 1996:

> Half a century after it began, the nuclear drama has

> rather happy ending in spite of the **[[gloomy prospects for

> dangers of nuclear warfare.19

The Nuclear Proliferation Debate: Optimists and Pessimists

The thinking that led to a conceptualization of nuclear history into two
distinct nuclear ages is also reflective of the broader debate about the
role of nuclear weapons in international politics. In essence, [the
**relative stability**]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} at least [the
**lack of major interstate war**]{.underline}, [of the **First Nuclear
Age**]{.underline} [gave rise to the]{.underline} [[notion]{.underline}
[that]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear [[weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} [had
[helped]{.mark} to "**keep [the peace]{.mark}**]{.underline}" [during
the Cold War]{.underline}, [and that **horizontal**]{.underline} nuclear
**[prolif]{.underline}**eration [might]{.underline} therefore [be
**stabilizing**]{.underline}. This is based on the theory of the nuclear
revolution (discussed in the next chapter) and specifically the notion
that the advent of nuclear weapons fundamentally changed warfare,
because no rational actor would want to risk attacking an adversary if
they could retaliate with nuclear weapons. Thus, a certain level of
stability might be achieved between nuclear-armed states that might not
otherwise exist. [However, this view]{.underline} of nuclear history,
and of the stabilizing potential of nuclear weapons, [[is]{.mark}
**[challenged]{.mark}**]{.underline} by those who believe that
[vertical]{.underline} nuclear **[prolif]{.underline}**eration [and a
[reliance]{.mark}]{.underline} [[on rationality]{.underline}]{.mark} and
luck [are **[not a good basis]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} international politics and
[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}. They also question the post-hoc view
that nuclear weapons were the main reason that the Cold War didn't turn
hot and warn against using this potentially flawed analogy today.

The concern that nuclear weapons will spread to new actors that
characterize the Second Nuclear Age has provided the backdrop for the
nuclear proliferation debate. The question at the heart of this debate
is whether nuclear proliferation to new actors will stabilize or
destabilize international politics and whether nuclear proliferation
makes inter-state, and possibly nuclear, war more or less likely. This
subject is at the center of a discussion between two political
scientists, Kenneth Waltz and Scott Sagan. The debate can be succinctly
explained as follows:

> Kenneth Waltz argues that fear of the spread of nuclear weapons is
> exaggerated: "More may be better" since new nuclear states will use
> their weapons to deter others from attacking them. Scott Sagan argues
> that the [**[spread]{.mark}** of]{.underline} nuclear [weapons will
> **[make]{.mark} the [world less stable]{.mark}**]{.underline}: "[more
> **will be worse**]{.underline}" [since]{.underline} [some]{.underline}
> new nuclear [[states]{.mark} will [engage in]{.mark}]{.underline}
> **[[preventive wars]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [fail to build
> **survivable forces**]{.underline}, [or have serious]{.underline}
> nuclear weapons **[accidents]{.underline}**.20

We can think of this debate as being split between proliferation
optimists and proliferation pessimists and centering on the wisdom and
reliability of Mutual Assured Destruction as a mechanism for stability
and security (see Chap. 5). Kenneth Waltz is seen as the champion of the
nuclear proliferation optimists, and Scott Sagan for the pessimists. The
central tenets of these two positions are explained below:

The proliferation optimists hold that horizontal nuclear proliferation
should not necessarily be viewed as automatically destabilizing. As
Kenneth Waltz explained in 1981:

> Those who dread a world with more nuclear states do little more than
> assert that more is worse and claim without substantiation that new
> nuclear states will be less responsible and less capable of
> self-control than the old ones have been. ... Such fears have proved
> unfounded as nuclear weapons have slowly spread. I have found many
> reasons for believing that with more nuclear states the world will
> have a promising future.21

This is partly because:

> New nuclear states will confront the possibilities and feel the
> constraints that present nuclear states have experienced. New nuclear
> states will be more concerned for their safety and more mindful of
> dangers than some of the old ones have been.22

Ultimately, this viewpoint believes that "Nuclear weapons reasonably
used make wars hard to start."23 As such, the spread of nuclear
weapons---in certain circumstances---should actually be welcomed, and
retaliatory nuclear deterrence and MAD does and should remain the
bedrock of global nuclear relations.

[The proliferation pessimists]{.underline} [contend]{.underline} [that
[horizontal]{.mark}]{.underline} nuclear
**[[prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration [can only ever
[lead]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to]{.mark} an **increase in nuclear
dangers**]{.underline} [and the **possibility** of]{.underline} nuclear
[use]{.underline}. Pessimists point to a [**number of factors** that
make]{.underline} horizontal **[prolif]{.underline}**eration potentially
**[dangerous]{.underline}**: [the [growth of]{.mark} the
threat]{.underline} [posed by]{.underline} **[[nucl]{.mark}ear
[terror]{.mark}ism]{.underline}** and illicit nuclear networks (see
Chap. 8); [the possibility of]{.underline} nuclear
**[accidents]{.underline}**; [the [difficulties of]{.mark} **ensuring
civilian control**]{.underline} [and safe]{.underline} and secure
[**[c]{.mark}**ommand [and]{.mark} **[c]{.mark}**ontrol]{.underline} of
nuclear weapons (see Chap. 5); [the [specter of]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[preventive war]{.underline}]{.mark}** [against]{.underline} aspirant
[nuclear states]{.underline} (see Chap. 8); [the [problem of]{.mark}
building **survivable [second strike]{.mark}** forces]{.underline}; [and
the fact]{.underline} [that stability]{.underline} [through
proliferation]{.underline} **[rests on actors]{.underline}** always
[behaving **rationally**]{.underline} at all times.24

Foremost amongst these however is a critique of the misplaced belief
that nuclear weapons helped keep the peace during the First Nuclear Age.
In the words of Sagan, writing in 2006:

> [[Deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark} optimism [is [based on]{.mark}
> **mistaken [nostalgia]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and a faulty
> analogy]{.underline}. [Although deterrence **did work** with
> the]{.underline} \[**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
> and\] the **[Soviet Union]{.underline}** and China, [there were
> [many]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[close calls]{.underline}]{.mark}**;
> [maintaining]{.underline} nuclear [peace [during]{.mark}
> the]{.underline} [[Cold War]{.underline}]{.mark} [was]{.underline} far
> more **[difficult]{.underline}** [and **uncertain** than US
> officials]{.underline} and the American public [seem to remember
> today]{.underline}.25

Proliferation pessimists focus on the problems of organizational culture
and the fact that [new]{.underline} nuclear [actors are]{.underline}
perhaps [**more likely** to experience]{.underline} nuclear
**[accidents]{.underline}**. As Scott Sagan explains,
"[professional]{.underline} military organizations--- because of common
biases, inflexible routines, and parochial
interests---[display]{.underline} [organizational behaviors
that]{.underline} [are likely to [lead to **deterrence
failures**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} deliberate]{.underline} [or **accidental
[nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline}".26 [[Newly
armed]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear [states]{.underline} might also [be
[less likely to]{.mark} be able to **[prevent
unauthorized]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[use]{.underline}]{.mark} because
they lack the positive mechanisms of strong civilian control.27
Consequently, pessimists argue that retaliatory nuclear deterrence (and
MAD) may not represent the panacea that it is held to be by
proliferation optimists. We can compare and contrast these views in
Table 4.5 below:

[Nuclear **Latency**]{.underline} [and **Virtual Nuclear

[While only a **small number** of states]{.underline} [have taken the

[the peculiarities]{.underline} [of]{.underline} nuclear
[technology]{.underline} [means that there exist]{.underline} [a number

nuclear [armed states]{.underline}. These [states]{.underline}

\[\[TABLE 4.5 OMITTED\]\]

**[possess]{.underline}** [their own]{.underline} [civilian]{.underline}
nuclear [programs]{.underline}, [often including]{.underline} [the
ability to **produce highly enriched uranium**]{.underline} or plutonium

**[advanced]{.underline}** military [infrastructure]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} [could be used to **develop a nuc**lear]{.underline}
[weapon]{.underline} (for more on this see Chap. 11). While [these
states]{.underline} may [not be able to build a working
bomb]{.underline} **[overnight]{.underline}** (or in total secrecy),
[they could]{.underline} probably [do so in a **relatively short
space**]{.underline} [of time should]{.underline} [they choose
to]{.underline}---[although]{.underline} [estimates of this vary
from]{.underline} [case to case]{.underline} [and amongst
experts]{.underline}. [These [states]{.mark} are
[known]{.mark}]{.underline} [[as]{.mark} **[virtual]{.mark} nuclear
[weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline} [states]{.underline} [or
**threshold**]{.underline} nuclear [weapons states]{.underline} [because
they [adopt]{.mark} a position]{.underline} [referred to as **[nuclear
latency]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As Anver Cohen and Joseph Pilat explain:

> [Virtual weapons]{.underline} [are indeed a reality]{.underline} [of
> physics]{.underline} [and cannot be]{.underline}
> [ignored]{.underline}, [because **[knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline},
> **[[experience]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[materials]{.mark} and other

[Nuclear **latency** remains]{.underline} [one of the **biggest
proliferation challenges**]{.underline} facing the international
community today.

[The **complication** with]{.underline} [nuclear latency]{.underline}
[stems from the fact]{.underline} [that the **technology
needed**]{.underline} [for a civilian nuclear]{.underline} power
[program]{.underline} is very similar to that needed to produce fissile
material for a bomb, and because some military hardware designed for
non-nuclear weapons systems [can be **modified** to deliver]{.underline}
**[nuclear weapons]{.underline}** (aircraft or missiles for example).
The problem is compounded by the central bargain of the 1968 Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty whereby all states that have signed the Treaty
as Non-Nuclear Weapons States have a right to produce their own civilian
nuclear energy (for more on the NPT see Chap. 8). As a result,
[[states]{.underline}]{.mark} can **[[move]{.mark} fairly
[close]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to]{.mark} acquiring a
nuclear]{.underline} "**[breakout" [capability]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[without]{.underline}]{.mark} actually **[[undermining]{.mark} the
[NPT]{.mark}]{.underline}** or breaking international law (this is at
the heart of the current controversy over Iran's civilian nuclear
program and whether or not that is being used as a cover to develop
nuclear weapons). [With [hundreds of]{.mark} civilian]{.underline}
nuclear [[facilities]{.underline}]{.mark} and powerplants operating in
dozens of countries [[worldwide]{.underline}]{.mark},29 [the [challenge
of nuclear latency]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is]{.mark} **ever
[present]{.mark}**]{.underline}. According to the then Director of the
Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed ElBaradei in 2010:

> Some estimates indicate that **[40 countries]{.underline}** or more
> now [have the **know-how**]{.underline} [to produce]{.underline}
> **[nuc]{.underline}**lear weapon**[s]{.underline}**, [which means
> that]{.underline} [if they have the **required fissile
> material**]{.underline}---high enriched uranium or plutonium---we are
> relying primarily on the continued good intentions of these
> countries.30

While ElBaradei's statement should not necessarily be interpreted as
meaning that all of these states will or could easily build nuclear
weapons, it does underline the importance of this challenge. Indeed, and
despite the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan and the decision taken
by Germany in 2011 to phase out civilian nuclear power,31 the global
trend could be toward more rather than less nuclear power generation in
the future (for the implications of this see Chap. 11).

In theory, any country with an active civilian nuclear industry and a
modern weapons program could build a nuclear bomb, although this would
not be a straightforward task for any nation that decided to do so. [The
best-placed]{.underline} [states]{.underline} to do this
[have]{.underline} [**full control** of]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
nuclear [fuel cycle]{.underline}, i.e. [they can **enrich**]{.underline}
the fuel for (uranium) [and]{.underline}/or [separate]{.underline} [the
by-products of **nuclear fission**]{.underline} (plutonium). States that
operate a civilian nuclear power capability but have to buy nuclear fuel
from abroad are far less of a proliferation risk, although because
plutonium is a by-product of uranium fission (see Chap. 2)
[these]{.underline} civilian power [plants]{.underline} [must be
**closely monitored**]{.underline} by the relevant international
authorities, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
However, technological capabilities are only one dynamic of
proliferation and must of course be matched with the political will
required to build a bomb. [Developing a nuclear warhead small enough to
be placed]{.underline} [on a missile]{.underline} and that can survive
the pressures of fight and possibly atmospheric re-entry for example
[is]{.underline} a [very difficult]{.underline} task, [although by **no
means insurmountable**]{.underline} for a modern state. In general, [a
nation wishing to move from latency]{.underline} [to full]{.underline}
nuclear [weapons]{.underline} [capability]{.underline} [would **meet
significant challenges**]{.underline}, not least keeping the program
secret from the international community and the International Atomic
Energy Agency (the world's nuclear watchdog).

Below are a number of examples of states that we might consider as
having various degrees of nuclear latency:

• Japan. **[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}** is usually [held up as the
**model** of a latent]{.underline} nuclear [weapons state]{.underline}
[because it [has]{.mark} an **[advanced]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[civilian]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear [[industry]{.underline}]{.mark},
[the ability to produce]{.underline} [highly **enriched
uranium**]{.underline} or plutonium (in addition to the large stockpiles
it already has) [and a modern military]{.underline}. [Given the
**geopolitical tensions**]{.underline} in Northeast Asia, [the threat
that Japan]{.underline} [may]{.underline} decide to "[**go nuclear**" is
**ever-present**]{.underline}, although most observers suggest that
there is little enthusiasm for such a move, and Japan remains a key
member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. However, [Japan could probably
build a **deliverable**]{.underline} nuclear [weapon if it chose to
within a relatively]{.underline} **[short space of time]{.underline}**
(maybe less than a year).32 As Mark Fitzpatrick noted in 2019, "The
biggest obstacles to a Japanese nuclear weapons program aren't technical
or logistic; they are political, legal, and cultural."33

• South Korea. **[[So]{.underline}]{.mark}**uth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea [operates a number of
civilian]{.underline} nuclear [power plants]{.underline} [and has
**expressed an interest** in acquiring]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
[tech]{.underline}nology [necessary]{.underline} [to control the
**nuclear fuel cycle**]{.underline} (it can't currently enrich uranium
or reprocess plutonium).34 [It]{.underline} also [theoretically has the
**infrastructure** and **manufacturing base**]{.underline} [to support a
nuclear weapons]{.underline} [programme]{.underline}.35 Like Japan and
Taiwan, [South Korea sits in a]{.underline} potentially [**volatile**
region and **future changes** could drive the case for a
bomb]{.underline}. **[So]{.underline}**uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea also
previously hosted US tactical nuclear weapons on its territory during
the Cold War (until 1991) and is believed to have
**[entertained]{.underline}** [the idea]{.underline} [of a
**home-grown**]{.underline} nuclear **[weapons effort]{.underline}** in
the past.36 The likelihood of a future nuclear-disarmed North Korea and
the credibility of the US-extended guarantee are probably the key
variables in any future move toward acquiring the bomb.37

• Taiwan. Taiwan is not a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty given
its unique status in international society and has previously had an
indigenous nuclear weapons programs in the 1970s. While it is not
currently believed to have enrichment or reprocessing capabilities,
Taiwan does have specific regional concerns that could lead to arguments
for a nuclear weapons capability, but the costs of doing so are possibly
too high for the time being (US opposition, international condemnation,
or even a Chinese pre-emptive strike). Taiwan would probably also need
to build a suitable missile and warhead.38 As Arthur Ding suggested in
2012, "Despite the logic that strategic logic might dictate the
acquisition of a modest nuclear arsenal. Taiwan is unlikely to develop
nuclear weapons."39 But this could of course change in the future.

• Brazil. [**[Brazil]{.mark}** [possesses]{.mark} all the **major
[elements]{.mark}**]{.underline} [needed to produce]{.underline} fissile
[material for a bomb]{.underline} (from an indigenous supply of uranium
ore to enrichment and the ability to fabricate nuclear fuel) but
currently lacks the means to deliver nuclear weapons should it choose to
build them, although it has previously had a nuclear bomb program (see
Chap. 10). Brazil is also an active member of the Non-Proliferation
Treaty and is seen as an unlikely future nuclear weapons state at the
time of writing.40

• Iran. [**[Iran]{.mark}** is a member of the]{.underline}
**[N]{.underline}**on-**[P]{.underline}**roliferation
**[T]{.underline}**reaty, [but it has **long been
suspected**]{.underline} [that its]{.underline} nuclear [program could
be]{.underline} [designed for military]{.underline}
[purposes]{.underline}. [Iran]{.underline} [appears to be
**[seeking]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to achieve]{.underline}]{.mark}
[full control]{.underline} [of the]{.underline} nuclear **[[fuel
cycle]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [which would mean]{.underline} [an
ability]{.underline} [to produce highly]{.underline}
[enriched]{.underline} uranium and [plutonium]{.underline}, [and has a
**large military**]{.underline}, [including a relatively]{.underline}
[advanced]{.underline} **[ballistic missile]{.underline}**
[program]{.underline}. [Iran is]{.underline} perhaps [the **biggest
concern**]{.underline} [for future **prolif**]{.underline}eration due to
its current geopolitical situation,41 and [especially]{.underline}
[[after]{.mark} the US withdrew]{.underline} [from]{.underline} the
**[[J]{.underline}]{.mark}**oint
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**omprehensive **[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}**lan
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**ction in 2018
(for more on Iran and the Iran Nuclear Deal see Chap. 7).

• Saudi Arabia. [Sitting at the **heart of a region**]{.underline} with
ever-changing security requirements---not least the possibility of a
nuclear-armed Iran on its doorstep, [coupled with a **perceived
decline**]{.underline} [in US influence,]{.underline} and with an
advanced infrastructure and burgeoning economy,
[[Saudi]{.underline}]{.mark} Arabia [represents a
**serious**]{.underline} nuclear **[prolif]{.underline}**eration
[concern]{.underline}.42 [Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [has only a
**rudimentary**]{.underline} [civilian]{.underline} nuclear
[infrastructure]{.underline}, [but it is **rumored** to [have]{.mark}

said, noting that it [consists of a **combined team** from **Cybercom**
and **NSA**]{.underline}.

Nakasone also mentioned the importance of partnerships with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the National Guard Bureau and the Department of
Homeland Security\'s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency,
which involves sharing information with those who need it as quickly as
possible.

Cybercom conducted more than 2,000 operations to get ahead of foreign
threats before they interfered or influenced the 2020 elections,
Nakasone said.

The general said he wanted to make three important points: \"First,
Cybercom must be and is able, ready and willing to act. Second,
[Cybercom\'s partnership with NSA remains the **foundation** of **our
success**]{.underline}. And third, we enable our domestic industry,
allies and partners by providing critical threat information and
insights, which improve their ability to act under their unique
authorities.\"

[A **senior Pentagon official**]{.underline} on Thursday [said the
**Biden administration** will review the joint leadership
structure]{.underline} that has long governed U.S. Cyber Command and the
National Security Agency.

"I believe that [the **'dual-hat'** will be looked at]{.underline}
again, just by this administration, just to ensure that we understand
what the value added is, but also what the impacts are. And so [that
discussion is **still ongoing**]{.underline} within the department
today," Ronald Moultrie, Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and
Security testified during a House Armed Services Committee subpanel
hearing.

"We understand that there is sentiment --- on both sides --- to really
not do any harm," he added. "But I believe that it will be looked at.
It'll be an objective look."

The two agencies, which are co-located at Fort Meade, Md., have shared
leadership under a so-called dual-hat arrangement ever since the Defense
Department stood up Cyber Command in 2009.

[While there have been attempts to **split up** the two **in the
past**]{.underline} --- most notably near the end of the Obama
administration and an 11th-hour push in the final weeks of the Trump

digital warfighting unit and the federal government's largest
intelligence agency nearly four years ago.

But better late(ish) than never. "[The NSA has a **great deal of
expertise** in the **domain of cybersecurity**, and **further
empowerment** of **this agency**]{.underline} to advise, support and
direct the broader mission is likely to [mitigate risks to our
nation]{.underline}'s information system infrastructure," said Tim Wade,
technical director, CTO team, Vectra. "This order reflects the consensus
that technology reflects a critical war front in today's digital age and
one of national importance."

Biden's directive, bearing the officious name National Security
Memorandum 8, "Improving the Cybersecurity of National Security,
Department of Defense and Intelligence Community Systems," represents
the implementation of last spring's EO 14028 that set out cybersecurity
requirements for national security systems (NSS) sprawled across the
federal government and those that contain classified information or are
crucial to military and intelligence activities. The memorandum named
General Paul M. Nakasone, Commander, U.S. Cyber Command, Director,
NSA/Chief, Central Security Service as national manager for NSS.

"We stand ready to fulfill our role, and our responsibility, in securing
our nation against foreign malicious actors, and any efforts to exploit
our national security systems," Nakasone said in a release.

[**Nakasone's authority** will include the ability to issue **binding

[operating NSS. Those directives include requiring they take action
against **cybersecurity threats** and **vulnerabilities** and report

also alert the national manager to any suspected NSS incidents and

The [Biden]{.underline} administration [is reviewing]{.underline}
whether and [**how to change** a **Trump-era policy** that gave
**unprecedented authority** to the **D**]{.underline}epartment
**[o]{.underline}**f **[D]{.underline}**efense [and]{.underline} U.S.
**[Cyber Com]{.underline}**mand [to authorize
**cyber-op**]{.underline}eration[**s** without **White House
approval**]{.underline}, two sources briefed on the discussions said.

[The admin]{.underline}istration [has launched a]{.underline}n
"interagency **[review process]{.underline}**" [**paving the way** for
**revisions** to]{.underline} the Trump-era National Security
Presidential Memorandum-13 (**[NSPM-13]{.underline}**), one of the
sources said. The White House National Security Council is spearheading
the effort, according to the sources.

NSPM-13, [which]{.underline} became policy in 2018, [allowed the
**delegation** of]{.underline} "[**well-defined authorities** to the
**secretary of defense**]{.underline} to conduct time-sensitive military
operations in cyberspace," according to a 2020 speech given by Paul Ney,
then the general counsel for the DOD.

A spokeswoman for the National Security Council declined to comment.

NSPM-13 has long been controversial, and many Washington insiders called
its 2018 implementation an unusual response by the Trump administration
to historically slow decision-making in the cyber realm, particularly
during the Obama administration. NSPM-13 built on the principle of
persistent engagement, which Ney described as "continuously engaging and
contesting adversaries and causing them uncertainty wherever they
maneuver." NSPM-13, which is classified, also was reportedly amended by
another classified memo, NSPM-21, and figured into President Donald
Trump's draft executive order directing the defense secretary to seize
voting machines, according to POLITICO.

"Persistent engagement recognizes that cyberspace's structural feature
of interconnectedness and its core condition of constant contact creates
a strategic necessity to operate continuously in cyberspace," Ney said
in his remarks, which were made at the Cyber Command Legal Conference in
March 2020. "As \[Cyber Command chief\] Gen. \[Paul\] Nakasone has said,
'if we find ourselves defending inside our own networks, we have lost
the initiative and the advantage.\'"

One of the sources briefed on the administration's plans to review
NSPM-13 said that [**White House officials** want to]{.underline}
"[regularize **cyber operations**]{.underline}." The source described
the Trump administration's delegation of broad cyber authorities to the
Defense Department as highly unusual.

"No other kind of weapon system \[or\] attack system do we do that so
it's unprecedented," the source said of the Trump decision to allow DOD
to launch cyber-operations without White House approval. "If you're not
in combat, the commander is supposed to check in with White House and
the president. That's how we've done it before. That's how we usually do
it ... The White House should normally have control. That's how it
works. That's how it works in most other countries."

"We have very clear rules in the physical world that we don't have in
cyberspace yet. That lack of clarity is part of the problem ... and why
there's an argument for being careful."

FORMER OBAMA CYBERSECURITY COORDINATOR MICHAEL DANIEL

[The lack of **precedent** underpinning]{.underline} many
**[cyberwar]{.underline}** scenarios [makes the **delegation of
authority** to the Defense Department **even riskier**]{.underline},
said Michael Daniel, a former Obama administration cybersecurity
official who now runs the Cyber Threat Alliance, a cybersecurity
nonprofit. Daniel pointed out that when it comes to traditional
operations such as flying over another country's airspace there is clear
agreement on how high a plane can fly to respect other nations'
sovereignty. No such clarity exists for cyber operations, Daniel said.

"We have very clear rules in the physical world that we don't have in
cyberspace yet," Daniel said. "That lack of clarity is part of the
problem ... and why [there's an argument for **being careful** about and
**having oversight** over **o**]{.underline}ffensive
**[c]{.underline}**yber **[o]{.underline}**peration**[s]{.underline}**."

Daniel, who served as cybersecurity coordinator on the National Security
Council staff from 2012-2017, conceded that the Obama administration
sometimes moved slowly making cyber decisions but said that 2012 was a
different era than today. He rejected complaints by some that the Obama
administration moved excessively slowly, however, and said it is
important to remember the broader context before assessing these types
of complaints.

"[The fact that \[**an ally**\] may]{.underline} have [be]{.underline}en
able to move **[faster]{.underline}** than us [is not]{.underline}
necessarily [a sign that that was the **right speed**]{.underline} to be
going and their risk-benefit calculus is different than ours," Daniel
said.

From one administration to the next

The Trump administration decided to overturn Obama-era cyber authorities
in order to allow the Department of Defense to move more quickly. John
Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, wrote about the
administration's path to negotiating NSPM-13 in his book "The Room Where
It Happened."

"The interagency process was frozen solid. The Department of Homeland
Security and others wanted to keep a stranglehold on the Defense
Department, as did the intelligence community," Bolton wrote of the
Trump administration's infighting as it created NSPM-13. "The Pentagon
didn't want oversight from anyone, including the White House, and took
an 'all or nothing' approach in negotiations that only infuriated
everyone else involved."

Bolton wrote that some in [the **intelligence community** did not
**fully support** NSPM-13]{.underline}, with many at the CIA envious of
the Defense Department's new authority.

"[This reflected]{.underline} a long-standing, almost
**[existential]{.underline}**, CIA-Pentagon **[tension]{.underline}**,"
Bolton wrote.

Bolton did not return a call seeking comment for this story.

Christopher Painter, the former top cyber official in the Obama State
Department, acknowledged that sometimes decisions took time to arrive
at, but he said often DOD shared some of the blame.

"There were times when things were simply slower than they would like,"
Painter said of the DOD in that era. "I think sometimes that was their
own fault."

Painter said the White House should take back control of cyber
authorities so that no one agency is operating in a vacuum. He said it
is important for the government to coordinate across agencies so that
all tools --- economic, diplomatic and military --- can be used. He
argued that by having the White House determine how and when to act on
cyber operations, and by allowing the White House to deploy multiple
tactics at once, strategic advantages will follow.

"[If the **flaming ball of cyber death** is coming]{.underline} toward
you [you have to]{.underline} respond immediately," Painter said. "But
we also have some ability to [plan and figure out how we're going to
respond]{.underline} and what tools we're going to use ... Having all of
those tools together and doing them strategically as part of a plan, I
think really does require the White House to be calling the shots."

Others pointed to the **[balance of powers]{.underline}** that [is
threatened when]{.underline} anyone who's at [an agency gets a **level
of authority** which others **lack**]{.underline}. Tom Bossert, who was
a homeland security adviser to Trump, said the debate is fueled in large
part by how different government entities relate to each other as they
vie for authority.

"[There's a **trade off** between **acting on
intelligence**]{.underline} to further our national interests or foil a
plot [and **tipping your hand**, losing often fragile **intelligence
channels**]{.underline} or burning human sources. In cyber, different
agencies have different opinions on when and why we should break things
or spy on them," Bossert, now president of the threat prevention firm
Trinity Cyber, said. "U.S. Cyber Command has the authority to weigh the
various considerations and equities and other agencies sometimes
disagree."

\"[We\'ve conducted]{.underline} a series of
**[operations]{.underline}** across the full spectrum; offensive,
defensive, \[and\] information operations,\" General Paul Nakasone said
in an interview with Sky News. A spokesperson for [the
command]{.underline} did not dispute the accuracy of the article but
[**declined to elaborate** on what the command\'s **operations in
Ukraine** have **entailed**]{.underline}.

It\'s a rare public acknowledgment from US military officials of
**[hacking operations]{.underline}** that [are]{.underline} often
**[shrouded in mystery]{.underline}**.

Nakasone\'s comments, and the White House\'s response to them, suggest
that cyberspace is a domain in which the Biden administration feels
comfortable countering Russia without fear of escalation. President Joe
Biden has pledged not to engage directly with Russia militarily during
the Ukraine war so long as the US and its allies aren\'t attacked.

Pro-Russia online operatives falsely claimed Zelensky committed suicide

Pro-Russia online operatives falsely claimed Zelensky committed suicide
in an effort to sway public opinion, cybersecurity firm says

\"We don\'t see it as such,\" White House press secretary Karine
Jean-Pierre said Wednesday when asked at a news conference whether Cyber
Command\'s actions contradicted Biden\'s pledge.

Officials from Biden on down have for months warned about the threat of
retaliatory Russian cyberattacks against US infrastructure after the US
and its allies imposed sweeping sanctions on the Kremlin over its war in
Ukraine.

While analysts have proffered a range of theories, including
improvements in US defenses, for why such a hack hasn\'t apparently
happened yet, US officials tell CNN that Russian fear of escalation in
cyberspace could be one factor.

For one, Moscow may not want to risk retaliatory US cyberattacks that
could hinder Russian military operations, a senior US defense
intelligence official told CNN.

The Russians have already had enough problems in Ukraine executing
military operations, \"I think that adding any kind of potential for US
cyber into that mix \... \[is\] probably factoring into their decision
calculus,\" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity
to speak candidly about a sensitive national security issue.

US and European allies blame Russia for cyberattack on satellite
provider as Ukraine invasion began

The paucity of Russian hacking on US targets may reflect the \"fear of
escalation and what the US response might be, particularly if the US
response affects Russian combat power in some form or fashion,\" the
official added.

The statements, from an interview with a senior official tasked with
keeping a close eye on Russian cyber activity, offer a window into US
thinking on Russian hacking at a critical time in the war \-- as the
Kremlin targets eastern Ukraine after failing to take Kyiv.

The official\'s analysis also reflects the uncertainty and ambiguity of
big-power competition in cyberspace, where governments try to keep each
other guessing on their hacking capabilities and willingness to use
them.

\"For Russia, understanding the full scope of US cyber combat power is a
gap for them which leaves them unsure about opening this front, at least
at this time,\" the senior US official said. \"Cyber warfare is a new
domain \... It hasn\'t been around long enough for any one nation-state
to dominate it.\"

\'Attribution in peacetime is tricky enough\'

Analysts say **[Cyber Com]{.underline}**mand has matured considerably
since its inception more than a decade ago and has increasingly become a
tool of US power projection. The command sent personnel to Ukraine in
December, in anticipation of the Russian invasion, to help Kyiv bolster
its cyber defenses and to gather information about potential Russian
hacking threats, officials have said.

There are a range of [activities, includ]{.underline}ing [**low-level**
intrusions into **computer networks**, that may qualify as
**\"offensive\" cyber operations** but which the Russians may not
necessarily interpret as **escalatory**]{.underline}, according to Bobby
Chesney, an associate dean at the University of Texas School of Law who
focuses on cyber and national security law.

Some of the command\'s previous hacking operations have included
knocking a Russian troll farm offline during 2018 US midterm elections,
according to a Washington Post report, and targeting ransomware
operatives who threaten US organizations.

While big hacks of US organizations related to the Ukraine war have been
in short supply, a plethora of attempted cyberattacks have been reported
in Ukraine and Russia as digital vigilantes take sides in the war. The
websites of Russian government ministries and media mouthpieces have
been knocked offline or altered to broadcast anti-war slogans.

The senior US defense intelligence official expressed concern that the
Russian government may mistakenly assess that that type of hacking is
coming from the US government.

\"Attribution in peacetime is tricky enough \... I would say [there\'s a
**real danger** of **unintentionally attributing** something to **the
U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [that the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates or its allies simply **[did not
do]{.underline}**,\" the official said.

#### New cyber initiatives [infringe]{.underline} on NSA authority, causing [jurisdictional confusion]{.underline} and undermining their [primacy]{.underline}.

Confusion,"

Law360 (January 24, 2022, 7:01 PM EST) \-- A new White House memo aimed
at [improving **cybersecurity**]{.underline} coordination and standards
across national security agencies [may end up]{.underline} having the
unintended effect of [causing **confusion** when **cybersecurity
missions** overlap with]{.underline} those of [other **federal
agencies**]{.underline}.

[The]{.underline} Jan. 19 [memorandum requires the]{.underline} U.S.
**[D]{.underline}**epartment **[o]{.underline}**f
**[D]{.underline}**efense and the 17 agencies and offices within the
Intelligence Community [to meet]{.underline} or exceed the same
**[cybersecurity standards]{.underline}** that \"civilian\" agencies ---
all the other executive branch agencies --- are required to meet under a
May 2021 executive order. [The **N**]{.underline}ational
**[S]{.underline}**ecurity **[A]{.underline}**gency [will **take the
lead**]{.underline} in coordinating those efforts [as a]{.underline}
\"**[national manager]{.underline}**,\" according to the memo.

The document provides a framework for what should be done within the
national security community to improve [cybersecurity]{.underline}, but
[is **not clear** on **when and how**]{.underline} information and
[responsibility **should be shared** across]{.underline} civilian and
intelligence [agencies. This **lack of clarity**]{.underline} could
potentially [lead to **jurisdictional clashes**]{.underline} and
[**confusion** and to **privacy risks** related to
info]{.underline}rmation-[sharing]{.underline}, according to Alex Major,
co-chair of the government contracts practice at McCarter & English LLP.

\"The fact that you now have NSA and \[the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency\] in a position where they\'re conferring
on cybersecurity and incident response could pose a potential risk that
hopefully the national manager and CISA are both cognizant of,\" he
said. \"It\'s not really raised in the executive order, but those kinds
of privacy issues can become problematic if not done appropriately.\"

One potential area of [**confusion** may arise]{.underline} in
circumstances [where there is a **\"fine line\"** between whether an
incident should be handled by]{.underline} the law enforcement arm of [a
**civilian agency** or by an **intelligence agency**]{.underline},
according to Major, who is a retired Air Force intelligence officer.

For example, [if there is a **cyberattack**]{.underline} that might
involve a foreign power against a federal system that is not considered
to be a national security system, [**uncertainty** over who is
responsible could **delay** the]{.underline} federal government\'s
[response or result in an agency with **insufficient expertise**
leading]{.underline} the response. [Such a scenario]{.underline} has the
potential to [**worsen damages** to those systems]{.underline}.

The government will need to issue guidance to clarify how clashes
between areas of civilian and national security responsibilities will be
addressed, experts said. Such guidance would provide important clarity
for contractors who will help implement new cybersecurity programs,
Hogan Lovells counsel Stacy Hadeka said. But so far nothing has been
released since the May executive order.

\"We\'re still waiting on uniform guidance on the civilian side, and
have yet to get any updates if there\'ll be any kind of more uniform
government requirements,\" she said.

At least some possible clashes could be avoided, however, by a provision
in the memo that allows national security agencies to invoke an
exception to address \"circumstances necessitated by unique mission
needs,\" said Reed Smith LLP partner Liza Craig, a former Navy attorney.

\"Baked into this process \[is an\] exception where they can do things
... to address greater national security issues as they arise,\" she
said. \"I think that, in and of itself, will minimize those turf wars.\"

[The memo also lays out a **clear hierarchy**]{.underline} within the
national security community [that places the NSA **at the top**. The
ranking order could help minimize clashes between **national security
agencies** and eliminate instances of agencies keeping important
**cybersecurity information** to themselves]{.underline}, according to
Major of McCarter & English.

The NSA could also ensure continuity across different agencies with its
authority to issue binding operational directives to other national
security agencies to address known or suspected cyberthreats.

\"The national manager is supposed to be there as a referee or an umpire
to make sure that entities are doing what they\'re supposed to be
doing,\" Major said.

Any regulations that may be forthcoming are expected to be crafted in a
way that allows them to change over time in response to new kinds of
threats and evolving cybersecurity technology, and will hopefully lead
to a standardized approach across federal agencies, according to Reed
Smith\'s Craig.

\"To me, the takeaway is that this is no longer going to be left just to
the agencies to craft their own responses, but they\'re going to be able
to pool all the resources and all the knowledge and awareness and
experiences of these agencies to do something governmentwide,\" she
said.

Other indications that the regulations will be a \"living document\"
include the memo\'s references to cutting-edge technologies like quantum
cryptography, as well as the fact that the intelligence community is
often at the forefront of developing and using new technologies,
according to Hadeka of Hogan Lovells.

\"[NSA]{.underline}, I think, [will be in a **good position**
to]{.underline} hopefully [**take the lead** and **spearhead** \[efforts
to ensure requirements keep up with technology\]]{.underline} so that by
the time something\'s implemented it\'s not obsolete, which I think is a
big struggle with the federal government overall,\" Hadeka said.

#### There's a [clear separation]{.underline} between NSA and CYBERCOM jurisdiction\-\--the plan [intrudes on]{.underline} NSA territory.

Andrew **Schoka 19**, active duty Army cyber operations officer assigned
to U.S. Cyber Command at Fort Meade, Maryland, and Distinguished
Military Graduate of Virginia Tech with a bachelor's degree in systems
engineering, 4/03/2019, "CYBER COMMAND, THE NSA, AND OPERATING IN
CYBERSPACE: TIME TO END THE DUAL HAT,"
<https://warontherocks.com/2019/04/cyber-command-the-nsa-and-operating-in-cyberspace-time-to-end-the-dual-hat/>,
cc

For every operation Cyber Command executes, joint leaders and operations
planners must meticulously calculate and evaluate the risk associated
with that particular operation. This is an exceedingly complicated task
that requires detailed knowledge of the operations planning and approval
process, in addition to technical familiarity with the underlying
technologies associated with the operation. In developing this process,
Cyber Command has relied heavily on the experience of NSA, using similar
processes to ensure that risk is minimized. In so doing, Cyber Command
has inadvertently patterned its own appetite for risk after NSA's. But
[while NSA's operations are conducted with **scrupulous operational
security**, **intelligence collection** is **not** the primary mission
of **Cyber Command**]{.underline}. In the words of Gen. Paul Nakasone,
[Cyber Command's primary mission is to impose costs on adversaries who
have acted in the **cyberspace domain** without **fear of retaliation**.
Imposing cost implies inflicting **noticeable damage** to a target in a
manner that would typically be considered too **noisy**, **risky**, or
**noticeable** in **signals intelligence operations**]{.underline}.

When conducting offensive cyberspace operations, there are essentially
two ways to acquire access to a target system: using credentials to
masquerade as a legitimate user, and using a vulnerability to exploit a
system. In a masquerade, an attacker uses valid credentials, such as a
username and password, to log in to the target system as an authorized
user. Masquerade attacks are usually difficult to detect because they
rely on the system behaving the way it's supposed to. Conversely, an
exploit relies on the existence of a technical vulnerability that allows
an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a system. Exploitation relies
on a system functioning incorrectly, and is significantly more likely to
produce alerts that can expose an attack.

To assess the risk associated with these types of operations, Cyber
Command solicits approval from an array of staffs and reviewers. In part
because Cyber Command has relied heavily on NSA training, support, and
experience to establish these processes, exploitation operations ---
which by nature carry a greater risk of detection --- are subject to
increased standards of scrutiny. Likewise, operations that produce a
noticeable effect, such as a denial-of-service attack, are typically
viewed with aversion. This is detrimental to Cyber Command's execution
of its mission, as producing the desired outcomes against an adversary
requires assuming more risk. In reality, the operations approval
structure of Cyber Command is set up to prioritize the security of
operations above all else, and is extremely risk-averse. [Cyber
Command's mission is **fundamentally different** than
**NSA's**]{.underline}, and rather than copying approval processes used
in intelligence operations, it ought to employ a structure more typical
of a military command. However, as long as it relies on NSA tradecraft
and expertise Cyber Command will continue to use a paradoxical
operations process that is fundamentally opposed to the exact type of
mission it is charged with conducting.

[What is the **difference** between the two organizations?]{.underline}

similar---bland, yet encompassing descriptions of almost any kind of
virtual activity---[there **is** a]{.underline} subtle
**[difference]{.underline}**.

For example, [CYBERCOM has]{.underline} this to say: "United States Army
Cyber Command directs and conducts integrated electronic
**[warfare]{.underline}**, information and cyberspace operations
\[\...\] through cyberspace and the information environment, and to deny
the same to our adversaries."

[Notable]{.underline} in the description [is the word
"warfare."]{.underline} Again the clandestine nature of the organization
makes it hard to say, but perhaps [CYBERCOM has its hand in]{.underline}
alleged **[offensive activities]{.underline}** like attacks on Iran and
Russia.

The debate about mixing-up military and civilian systems in the cyber
security has pro and cons. According to Gen. Nakasone remarks,21 [the
dualhat arrangement has enabled an **operationally close**, **mutually
beneficial** partnership]{.underline}, for instance, in mapping networks
prior to operations.22 Similarly, the experience has also brought some
issues23, such as for example a growing dependence of Military CYBERCOM
Information Assurance (IA)24 on the civilian NSA IA25. About the cyber
issue, [**NSA** and **USCYBERCOM** have **fundamentally different
missions**. From an NSA perspective, cyber is about **gaining access**
to networks; from a **USCYBERCOM** point of view, it's
about]{.underline} every piece of [software]{.underline} on the
battlefield [the adversary is using and **preventing that software**
from **working**]{.underline} the way it was intended to work.26 In
cyberspace, [while the military wants to **attack**]{.underline}

NSA and Cyber Command Pull from the Same Talent Pool. [The **NSA** and
**Cyber Com**]{.underline}mand [operate **jointly**]{.underline} in many
instances. Not only do they both hire the same type of employee, but [a
number of employees work for **both** organizations
**simultaneously**]{.underline}, changing fluidly depending on the
situation. [Ending the **dual-hat arrangement**]{.underline} could
[result in personnel being **forced to choose**]{.underline} to work for
[either Cyber Com]{.underline}mand [or the NSA, leading to **personnel
issues**]{.underline} with[in both]{.underline}. Cyber Command still
relies on NSA personnel for its command staff, even though it now
operates independently of Strategic Command.

[This]{.underline} would be challenging under most circumstances, but
[is **especially** a problem given the challenges that the **NSA** and
**Cyber Com**]{.underline}mand [have with attracting]{.underline} and
retaining [top tech talent]{.underline}. Additionally, [**cyber talent**
takes **years** to cultivate]{.underline}, meaning that the recruits
filling the ranks would be less capable than their more experienced
counterparts. Lieutenant General Stephen Fogarty, Commander of Army
Cyber Command, testified before the Senate Armed Services Subcommittees
on Cybersecurity and Personnel that the average operator can spend fully
half of his or her six-year enlistment in training.29

Recent reporting shows that [the U.S. government is **struggling** to
attract]{.underline} and retain [**top cyber talent** due to **stiff
competition** from the **private sector**]{.underline}. The government
has difficulty competing with the high salaries and swift onboarding
processes large companies can offer. Cyber Command has outlined a series
of initiatives to help improve talent recruitment and retention,
including keeping close relationships with universities, increased pay
scales, and retention bonuses. But the government may not be able to
fill the necessary manpower demand it would create by splitting the
organizations.30

The NSA and Cyber Command also share personnel because of the relative
scarcity of cyber talent in the public sector. Despite Cyber Command's
Cyber Mission Force teams filling all of its 6,200 billets, recent
Senate testimony revealed lawmakers' concern about a "shortage of
cyber-capable personnel."31 This makes [the efficiency of **scarce
resources** **essential** for the command, and sharing personnel is
**key** to **that efficiency**]{.underline}.

**[Defense Is Likely the Best Defense]{.underline}**

[Attackers have the advantage. It takes a varsity defense to defeat a
team of junior varsity attackers.]{.underline} If the attackers bring
their own varsity team, the defenders need to have an all-star defense
to have a chance. And if the attackers are themselves an all-star team,
then few organizations in the world have much chance. There is certainly
a role for the new U.S. push for persistent engagement and defending
forward. When Russian cyber operatives are disrupting the opening
ceremony of the Olympic Games and North Koreans conduct cyber bank
heists around the world, it seems disingenuous to badmouth U.S.
countermeasures as being
escalatory.[122](https://tnsr.org/2020/09/the-escalation-inversion-and-other-oddities-of-situational-cyber-stability/#_ftn122) **[It
is destabilizing,]{.underline}** [**however**, to **elevate** the
operational concept of **persistent engagement to a strategy**, given
the likelihood of **destabilizing positive feedback.**]{.underline}

[A better option is]{.underline} for policymakers [to prioritize defense
and **reverse attacker advantage** though "**leverage**."]{.underline}
[The]{.underline} New York [Cyber Task Force analyzed **five decades**
of "technology, operational, and policy innovations which **most
advantage the defender**"]{.underline} [and concluded a more
defense-advantage cyberspace is possible with technical
solutions]{.underline} that can scale across the entire internet (rather
than just one enterprise at a time) [and fresh **investment** in
operational and process
**innovations**.]{.underline}[[123]{.underline}](https://tnsr.org/2020/09/the-escalation-inversion-and-other-oddities-of-situational-cyber-stability/#_ftn123)

[If cyberspace were more advantageous to the defender, many of the most
destabilizing dynamics would lose force with higher barriers to entry,
leading to fewer capable adversaries and fewer serious
attacks]{.underline}. [Since fewer attacks might be catastrophic, the
pressure for counter-offensive operations would be diminished with more
room for agreement and norm building.]{.underline}

#### [Cross-alliance]{.underline} intelligence-sharing [collapses]{.underline} NATO [cohesion]{.underline} and [cyber]{.underline} operations

Testing Alliance Consensus and Decision-making [The Alliance's
decision-making principle of consensus further complicates the
negotiations and agreement of a NATO offensive cyber
policy.]{.underline} The above-mentioned nuclear example almost
exclusively concerns kinetic and state-level physical destruction of
massive proportions. The dire consequences of the extremity of possible
nuclear proliferation are enough to establish credibility, deterrence,
and is a comparatively simpler way in getting its 30 member states on
board, especially in the context of Cold War bipolarity. [Cyberspace as
a domain of war contains a myriad of vested technical issues including
the difficulty of attributing attacks to specific
adversaries.]{.underline} Even though this is one the most prominent
difficulties according to a variety of research in cybersecurity, more
recent analyses published by NATO\'s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of
Excellence have suggested that the attribution gap is gradually
decreasing in size due to heavy research and development investment into
web tracing and identification designs largely spearheaded by the US
(Burton 11). A dynamic understanding of deterrence in cyberspace as
formerly suggested by taking into consideration social and historical
context will also alleviate the traditionally 'impossible' problem of
attribution. While such technical capabilities play a crucial role in
swaying the allies' considerations and decisions, the political and
strategic issues of simply conceptualizing an offensive cyber policy are
examined in closer detail here. Trust and Transparency [The transparency
and capability-sharing quality of NATO may give way for disagreement
amongst allies]{.underline}. Although the Alliance's communication on a
strategic and policy level is transparent, [it still possesses enough
opaque room to maneuver on an operational and tactical
level.]{.underline} Furthermore, the problem of [American supremacy in
cyber capabilities]{.underline} and NATO's reliance on its critical
perspective [may displease EU member states]{.underline} like France [in
their pursuit of strategic autonomy]{.underline} aside from its
prevailing aversion to today\'s American leadership. A new demand for
[cross-alliance intelligence-sharing on offensive cyber capabilities can
also exacerbate internal trust issues with the US.]{.underline} The
global [surveillance disclosures]{.underline} from 2013 onwards
[revealed allied surveillance and spying activities which damaged
confidence in NATO (Smeets; 2018). Discussion of further integrated
intelligence-sharing strategy under an offensive cyber policy can create
tension between Five Eyes states (Canada, the US, and the UK) and other
NATO allies]{.underline}. Doctrine Diversity Another overarching aspect
with the potential to determine allies' reception and leniency towards
an offensive cyber strategy is the diversity of threat perception among
NATO allies[. The diversity across allied standards in defining the
parameters of cyberattacks and the lack of overarching offensive cyber
policy could result in strategic ambiguity and discourage retaliation
(Arts 2). These differences stem from varied threat perceptions and
cyber norms.]{.underline} Nationally, both threat perception and cyber
norms are influenced by the state's experience with malicious
cyberattacks and its media and public opinion; and externally, the
state's engagement in bilateral and multilateral engagements are the
most effective ways in which threat perception and cyber norms are
shaped (Lewis 575). This hints at the political interest of near-Russia
states like Estonia and Finland to possess well-rounded cyber norms and
threat perception. Conversely, policy engagements on offensive
capabilities would also shape NATO allies' understanding as a whole.
[Without multilateral definitions, allies like Luxembourg and Iceland
who have not experienced similar events do not benefit from harmonized
knowledge and may not find justification to prioritize the strengthening
of cyber capabilities when allocating funds from the common NATO
budget]{.underline}. Not to mention the financial commitment issue
affects trust in the Alliance overall as well.

#### The plan destroys trust \-\-- NATO hates the idea of OCO's, and even the discussion creates backlash \-\-- The plans forced disclosure also causes backlash to US surveillance

Concerning the three categories and the potential policy shifting
described above, NATO finds itself in a difficult situation that, under
current NATO practices, will be hard to escape. In terms of the cyber
threat, defense, and technology approaches, NATO reflects behavior that
puts the Alliance at a disadvantage. [NATO tends to be conservative in
terms of legal issues, meaning that the Alliance does]{.underline} not
[promise]{.underline} to be [a fruitful forum for]{.underline} adapting
or revising legacy rules to reflect the particular challenges
**[cyber]{.underline}** poses. Similarly, with NATO operating on the
basis of consensus, the [Alliance's decision-making
processes]{.underline} might have [difficulty handling governance
questions created by the cyber]{.underline} defense
**[approach]{.underline}**, such as how "active" should NATO cyber
defense be. Operationally, NATO cyber defense appears more static and
reactive than active in orientation---a situation that could lead NATO
cyber defense to become a cyber "Maginot line" rather than an effective
defensive strategy. It is [not clear whether NATO members could reach
consensus]{.underline} on what more active cyber defense activities
would be permissible under international legal principles on sovereignty
and non-intervention. As noted earlier, NATO functions with the
capabilities its members make available to it, meaning that NATO's
technological capabilities in cyber might not reach cutting-edge status,
leaving NATO cyber defense behind the global technological curve in
cyberspace. This problem is exacerbated if policy makers in leading
powers, such as the United States and China, are placing more reliance
on developing, deploying, and using full-spectrum cyber technological
capabilities because of the perceived pitfalls of other approaches and
the mounting geopolitical competition now affecting cyberspace. [NATO
members are also extraordinarily sensitive to the Alliance having any
offensive cyber capabilities or even discussing the need to think
about]{.underline} the value of [cyber capabilities and
operations]{.underline} in missions [NATO might undertake]{.underline}
(as NATO has done with other technological developments affecting its
military missions).44 The North Atlantic Council has not discussed, let
alone authorized, the development of offensive capabilities, doctrine,
or rules of engagement in the cyber realm.45 [Whether NATO members could
agree on]{.underline} what **[offensive cyber operations]{.underline}**
international law would permit [is also not clear, especially in light
of difficulties cyber presents to the international law]{.underline} on
armed conflict **[revealed by the Tallinn Manual]{.underline}** and
other analyses.46 Events outside the specific context of NATO cyber
defense might also adversely affect NATO cooperation. For example, in
June 2013, negative [European reactions to the disclosure of a secret
U.S. surveillance program targeting cyber activities]{.underline} of
foreign nationals, code-named PRISM, [reflected new transAtlantic
tensions on **government surveillance in cyberspace**]{.underline}, its
implications for privacy and other civil liberties, and the potential
for European-American cooperation on cybersecurity. The Washington Post
reported that "\[t\]he **[discontent from Europe pointed]{.underline}**
to the breadth of fallout from the affair and [to the potential for
fresh strains between the United States and allies wary of American
intrusiveness]{.underline}."47 Whatever the long-term impact of this
political fallout, [the short-term consequences will likely not create
more willingness among NATO members to become more
ambitious]{.underline} with NATO cyber defense.

III\. Cross-Domain Deterrence of Cyberspace Operations. [Cross-domain
deterrence of cyberspace operations involves the use of]{.underline}
punishment and [denial across domains of warfighting]{.underline} and
foreign policy in order to deter adversaries from utilizing cyberspace
operations to create virtual or physical effects. In general, the major
underlying debate for all arguments about cyberspace and deterrence is
whether or not cyberspace is unique to conventional and nuclear models
of deterrence. Advocates of cyberspace's unique characteristics (Libicki
2009, Philbin 2013, Jensen 2012, Elliott 2011, Sterner 2011) argue that
[the technical qualities of cyberspace affect **attribution, signaling,
capabilities, and actors** in a way that fundamentally negates how we
**traditionally view successful deterrence**]{.underline}. These authors
argue that [it is uniquely difficult to attribute in a timely fashion,
to signal capabilities overtly, to anticipate cyberspace effects, to use
cyberspace weapons repeatedly, and to limit the amount of actors you
need to deter]{.underline}. [Taken in conjunction with the unique
interdependence of military and civilian cyber infrastructures, the
perceived asymmetries in vulnerabilities between the U.S. and its
enemies, and the lack of existing norms]{.underline}, these critics
argue that **[the U.S. cannot rely on retaliatory deterrence
strategies]{.underline}** **[or mutually assured
vulnerability]{.underline}** [for effective deterrence]{.underline} of
cyberspace operations. Advocates of cyberspace's unique qualities
[recommend policies]{.underline} that [are]{.underline} strategically
ambiguous, **[focused on defense]{.underline}** **[and
resiliency]{.underline}**, [and that]{.underline} **[invest in
attribution technologies]{.underline}** [over retaliatory
measures.]{.underline}

[A more defensible Internet is **within reach.**]{.underline} [New
game-changing technologies]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline} the
secure architectures permitted by [cloud]{.underline} technologies, [can
radically alter cyberspace with advantage and scale **in favor of
defenders**. But so too can operational and policy innovations, which
are often overlooked or discounted.]{.underline} When presented with new
proposals, decision makers should ask a few simple questions: Does this
new policy, process, or technology clearly bring leverage? If the
mechanism for creating leverage is not clear, then the innovation is
probably at best an incremental improvement. Incremental improvements,
while useful, should be treated as temporary band-aids and cannot (as
information sharing legislation demonstrates) be the last word. For any
given problem, where will leverage deliver the most impact? Leverage can
be applied to many existing, low-payoff solutions. For example, leverage
has been applied to reinvigorating cyber awareness education, the often
mundane set of tasks that discourages users from clicking on links. A
quarterly awareness video that provides less than one dollar of
additional security for each dollar spent certainly doesn't suffice.
Many firms now conduct their own phishing campaigns as an educational
exercise, targeting those who click on suspicious links for follow-up
online training. This report has argued for [a new approach to cyber
defense]{.underline}, one that can **[break the stalemate of the past
five decades, so that defenders finally have the high
ground,]{.underline}** [to fight with the advantage. This approach does
not have to be a highly complex, government-run "Moon Shot." It
certainly should not be a "Cyber Manhattan Project;" the Internet is a
boon to individuals and societies, not a weapon]{.underline}. If
anything, [the world needs a cyber equivalent of Silent
Spring]{.underline} to reveal to us how precious the Internet is and how
our actions are destroying it, [and energize stakeholders to
make]{.underline} some hard tradeoffs. The NY Cyber Task Force has tried
to bring [new, pragmatic approaches to cybersecurity.]{.underline} Some
of our [solutions can be implemented with **relative ease**]{.underline}
now that we've identified the lessons of success. Others will be far
more difficult, as they create clear winners and losers. All task force
members agree that smaller interventions are necessary now to avoid even
harder decisions as the situation worsens. [Defense is possible, but
only through leverage, and the sooner the better.]{.underline}

In a little over 20 years, the percent of the global population with
access to the Internet (and the larger cyberspace of connected devices
and information, terms this report will use interchangeably) has gone
from less than one to about 40, over 3.595 billion people.2 In the
United States alone, the Internet sector makes up an estimated six
percent of GDP; the "mobile internet and app services" subsector alone
has a "contribution to the US GDP \[of\] approximately 3.11%, putting it
at approximately the same size as the Automotive industry."3 [Yet, as
the reach and benefits of the Internet have increased, so too have the
economic costs. A 2015 study indicated that cybersecurity costs were
likely to rise above \$1.2 trillion by 2030 costing a total of roughly
\$20 trillion over those 15 years]{.underline}.4 **[The costs are high
because attackers in cyberspace have for decades held fundamental
advantages over defenders]{.underline}**. [The Internet was designed to
be flexible and open, not secure]{.underline}. For years, nearly every
device and piece of code added to cyberspace has reiterated this
pattern: "[minimum viable products" are rushed to market with **security
slapped on afterward as a band-aid,** rather than built in]{.underline}.
All this complexity has multiplied the costs and challenges of mounting
a successful defense. **[Still, defense is possible]{.underline}**. This
report builds on an [increasingly rich set of cybersecurity
research]{.underline} on [creating a "defense advantage" that raises
costs to attackers and enables cost-effective risk
management.]{.underline} Some of these ideas, such as to allow the least
privileges or to [failsafe]{.underline} in a secure manner, date back to
the 1970s.5 Other work, especially in the business community, [has
centered **on the return on investment of defensive
innovations**]{.underline}. Inspired by military tactics, others have
sought [to raise costs to attackers by making their task harder or
actively disrupting their operations.]{.underline} The NY Cyber Task
Force, through the experience of our members and interviews with other
experts, has tried to combine these three perspectives. Our task force
started by asking, "what technological, operational, and policy
innovations have had the greatest impact in thwarting attackers?" We
found that the highest-impact innovations shared two key traits: •
Defense advantage: Any [innovation]{.underline} by defenders must
**[impose far greater costs on attackers]{.underline}**. A "[dollar of
defense]{.underline}" (or hour or other measure of input) [should yield
not merely a "dollar of attack," but should force attackers to spend
considerably more to defeat it.]{.underline} • Hyperscale: The
[innovation]{.underline} must easily, even automatically, [work across
enterprises or cyberspace as a whole]{.underline}. The task force
members and the colleagues we interviewed consistently agreed on the
past innovations with the highest scale and leverage over attackers:
strong encryption, software that updates automatically with little or no
user intervention, and software that is secure because it was designed
that way (rather than having security bolted on afterwards), among
others. Importantly, the most transformative innovations have come not
only from technology. Some of the greatest advances in defense advantage
and hyperscale arose from improvements in organization, such as the
creation of the first Computer Emergency Response Teams in the 1980s,
and governance, such as the development of C-suite cybersecurity experts
(e.g., Chief Information Security Officers) in the 1990s. Other
successes have come from process innovations, like the "cyber kill
chain" and "intelligence-driven operations." And, better mapping and
analysis of the way attackers intrude into systems has led to better
strategies to keep them out. Policy actions, such as issuing legal
indictments and threatening governmental sanctions, seem to have
fostered bilateral norms and reduced the volume of espionage operations,
particularly from China. In 2013, the White House set a new policy
instructing   Building a Defensible Cyberspace: Report of the NY Cyber
Task Force \| 5 the US government to tell companies if it detects data
breaches in their systems.6 Largely because of this policy (barely 200
words long), notification from law enforcement is now one of the most
common ways companies learn of intruders. This public-private
cooperation means faster responses, limiting the disruption attackers
can cause.7 In each of these cases, the solution (while not necessarily
cheap in hours or dollars invested) reaped benefits that significantly
outweighed costs. This kind of leverage can make cyberspace more
defensible for a company, a sector, a nation, and the world as a whole.
[Having carefully assessed a variety of innovations,]{.underline} **[we
have concluded that defenders should adopt innovations]{.underline}**
that have the highest return. This, of course, requires that we assess
each innovation for its benefits and costs, an analysis that seems
obvious, but is not commonly employed today. The task force also
identified several innovations with potentially large impact, such as
reaching a consensus between policymakers and technology leaders to
build a defensible cyberspace, promoting more secure cloudbased
technologies, and improving authentication by finally dispensing with
passwords. Certain innovations we assessed were controversial among the
members of the task force, such as imposing regulations on network
service providers and holding software and hardware makers liable for
products with known but unpatched vulnerabilities. These and other
approaches [might deliver significant leverage]{.underline}, but would
certainly be met with fierce resistance and potentially impose
significant hurdles to innovation. Some solutions can be implemented
easily; others will be more difficult because they create clear winners
and losers. All members of the task force agree that the best solutions
rely on leverage and are necessary now to avoid far more intrusive ones
later. Text Box 1, below, summarizes the steps needed. Below we
summarize certain of our key findings regarding steps needed. [Taken
together, these steps will help build a more defensible
cyberspace]{.underline}

Deterring what? Much of the scholarly debate on NATO is preoccupied with
the current strategic adaptation of the alliance and the renewed focus
on deterring Russia.48 [Only a few contributors]{.underline} to this
debate [have addressed the addition of offensive cyber capabilities in
NATO]{.underline} force structure and response doctrine [as an element
in work to strengthen the alliance's deterrence posture.]{.underline}49
Neither in these contributions nor among the former and current NATO
employees who have publicly articulated this ambition is it clear what
kind of activity the integration of cyber effects in NATO seeks to
deter.50 Is it supposed to add to the classical deterrence (through the
threat of punishment) of conventional Russian threats to the territorial
integrity of eastern Europe? Or to the deterrence [of]{.underline}
hybrid activities---specifically [cyber
activities]{.underline}---against allied countries below the threshold
of armed conflict? This section addresses each of these possibilities in
turn. From Cold War deterrence and back NATO's founding purpose was to
maintain a sufficient military strength to deter aggression and attempts
at coercion, to prepare for the eventuality of deterrence failing, and
to ensure stability among European powers.51 During the Cold War, the
debates over NATO deterrence posture largely centred on the role of
nuclear weapons, and specifically whether the United States would
retaliate with these weapons in the event of a Soviet conventional
attack against allied states.52 In short, NATO deterrence was about
credibly extending the US nuclear (as well as conventional force)
deterrence to allies to discourage a Soviet military offensive into
eastern Europe. While NATO and its member states adapted to the new
security environment after the end of the Cold War by scaling down the
military investments and presence in eastern Europe and by focusing more
on crisis management,53 much of the Cold War deterrence language
returned when the Russian--Ukrainian conflict broke out in 2014.54 What
needs to be deterred today, much of the literature agrees, is not only a
full-scale military invasion but to a larger extent the use and support
of pro-Russian militant separatists who are willing to apply insurgency
tactics in NATO's post-Soviet member states.55 As a result, the allies'
military investments have been increasing again,56 a number of
initiatives such as the Enhanced Forward Presence in the Baltic States
and Poland have been introduced,57 and the discussions---and
disagreements---on the nuclear deterrence (of non-nuclear threats) have
re-emerged.58 Such responses are often presented as a renewed attempt by
NATO to reassert its deterrence and assurance posture by signalling
strength, preparedness and willingness to punish 'bad' behaviour.59 At
first sight, the introduction of CYOC seems to add to these deterrence
efforts. NATO added an offensive cyber option to reinforce its ability
to impose costs sufficient to dissuade adversaries from acting
aggressively. On closer examination, however, it is not self-evident
that requesting member states' delivery of offensive cyber effects in
NATO operations constitutes a necessary or even a substantial addition
to credibly signalling the ability and willingness to punish an
adversary. NATO's conventional capabilities are clearly already far
superior to Russia's---with or without fully integrated cyber effects.
Thus, a deterrence failure, resulting for example in a scenario in one
of the Baltic states similar to that which occurred in eastern Ukraine,
will not be the result of NATO's lack of available cyber tools in its
military toolbox; rather, if the Russian leadership were to consider it
in its interest to pursue such a scenario, it would mean that Russia's
decision-makers did not believe in the credibility of NATO's article 5
or in NATO's ability to mobilize its forces. The capacity to integrate
cyber effects would do nothing to change that. Furthermore,
[if]{.underline} the [establishment]{.underline} of CYOC [is an attempt
to signal defensive strength and unity in cyberspace]{.underline}, [it
remains **difficult to imagine**]{.underline} [that such signaling would
**dissuade adversaries from trying to penetrate NATO** and allied
systems]{.underline}. CYOC [does not change the fact that **NATO is not
tasked to govern** and secure **national IT systems**]{.underline}. In
an operational setting, states might connect to each other through
so-called federated mission networking; 60 but there is no tradition of
ceding control of the deployed national networks to NATO during military
operations. Hence, CYOC can only realistically seek to become a hub for
cyber-threat information-sharing and to support states' coordination and
synchronization of various national responses to these threats. In other
words, CYOC is unlikely to become an active defender in cyberspace that
causes doubt in the adversary's evaluation of its own cyber
capabilities. This also means that [even if]{.underline} CYOC's
coordination and [information-sharing efforts manage to contribute to
the denial of intrusions into allied systems]{.underline}, an
**[adversary's military is unlikely to be deterred from trying to hack
these systems]{.underline}**. In fact, [actively
articulating]{.underline} that CYOC is supposed to [deter]{.underline}
(through denial) a perceived adversary such as [Russia from hacking NATO
and allied operational systems creates an incentive to do just that and
thereby show that the alliance is incapable of doing what it says it
seeks to do]{.underline}. However, the renewed concern about Russia's
intentions in NATO member states since 2014 is not confined to the need
to deter hostile military invasions or paramilitary activity. It also
encompasses a range of subversive, non-military activities that have
become available and are often considered part of a broader Russian
strategy of 'hybrid warfare'.61 Can CYOC and the integration of cyber
effects deter the non-military hybrid activities that have become
possible with the new information and communication technologies?
Deterring cyber activity below the threshold of collective defence
'Hybrid' has become a popular concept when describing the current threat
environment. While discussions over the definition, novelty and
usefulness of the concept continue, there seems to be agreement that,
when used to qualify 'threat' or 'warfare', 'hybrid' refers to the
blurring of the distinction between military and civilian, often in
relation to the mixture of instruments used to obtain political
objectives.62 NATO's attempt to deter military and paramilitary
instruments from being deployed has already been touched upon above. As
a primarily military alliance, however, NATO is facing difficulty in
addressing the instruments that are used deliberately to stay below the
threshold of collective defence. NATO has not been able to deter the
perpetration of random ransomware incidents, election interference and
targeted propaganda campaigns through hacks and leaks, or industrial
cyber espionage and intrusion into critical infrastructures. The
alliance's conventional capabilities are not credible (proportional)
responses to such malicious cyber activity. Thus, it has responded only
by 'naming and shaming', and by expressing encouragement to member
states to enhance the resilience of their networks.63 These responses,
however, have yet to prove effective in halting the malicious cyber
activity conducted below the threshold of collective defence.64 And the
introduction of SCEPVA is not likely to change that; the integration of
cyber effects is tied to NATO military operations only. While NATO
member states are already compelled to maintain a level of cooperation
in collective defence (article 3), and to consult together whenever any
of them feels that its territorial integrity, political independence or
security is threatened (article 4), NATO---with or without integrated
cyber effects---is not an alliance designed to deal with non-military
threats from a peer competitor. The question then arises: does the lack
of capacity to deter non-military hybrid cyber activities suggest that
it is time for NATO to renegotiate the scope and substance of its
collective defence clause?65 When it comes to cyberspace, the next
section expresses scepticism about expanding NATO's role. It addresses
the escalation risk associated with having NATO, an organization that
has refocused its attention on a more traditional military threat,
become a more active player below the threshold of collective defence.
It argues that a more active stance outside military confrontation risks
undermining the intelligence norm that currently dominates in
cyberspace---a norm whereby state activity in foreign networks is not
considered escalatory. Escalation and the dominant intelligence norm The
large overlap between intelligence collection and attack in cyberspace
makes it difficult to send clear signals to adversaries, in terms of
either capabilities or intentions. When a foreign entity is moving
around in a network, is it then about to start a military operation? Is
the activity part of a reconnaissance mission? Is it political or
economic espionage? Is it active defence? The difficulty of answering
these questions has created much nervousness among cyber-conflict
experts. Ben Buchanan, for example, has shown how defensive hacking or
intelligence-gathering in cyberspace is easily misinterpreted as
aggressive behaviour.66 Why, then, have we not experienced serious
misinterpretation and escalation in cyberspace? One way to explain this
is through the existence and dominance of a largely unspoken but widely
accepted norm. For decades, the predominant actors in cyberspace have
been intelligence agencies; and the norms that characterize interactions
between intelligence agencies are not primarily concerned with military
concepts such as conflict escalation and deterrence.67 In the world of
intelligence agencies, success is not about keeping a distance between
oneself and the adversary by signalling one's intentions and
capabilities. It is about being able to outmanoeuvre adversaries in a
space of constant contact.68 There are always risks, and the work
usually takes place in legal grey zones where a clear distinction
between war and peace is not the guiding principle. This is an arena
where the opportunity to annoy, cheat and delay opponents is taken when
it arises. In short, espionage and counter-espionage do not fit well
with the thorough military operational planning that characterizes NATO
operations. Intelligence operations, on the other hand, fit perfectly
with a dynamic cyberspace where anonymity is easy to achieve and
uncertainty a constant condition.69 The states that embrace cyberspace
as a domain where the intelligence norm dominates are able to use a
broader array of tools to pursue or respond to various foreign political
objectives than only those that relate to military operations. In its
2018 'vision', the US Cyber Command built implicitly on the dominant
intelligence norm. Here, the objective is to become more agile and act
as close to the adversary as possible ('defend forward').70 The United
States considers 'constant contact' and 'persistent engagement' as the
necessary guiding principles to achieve superiority in cyberspace and to
take full advantage of the broader potential for pursuing its political
objectives through cyberspace. During the 2018 US midterm elections, for
example, the US Cyber Command worked closely with the NSA to disrupt
servers operated by the Russian Internet Research Agency aiming to
spread fake news and stir up tension in the United States.71 More
recently, the US Cyber Command responded with various cyber effects
against Iran after the Iranian Revolutionary Guards apparently placed
mines on ships in the Strait of Hormuz.72 These practices illustrate
that, for the United States, [cyber effects provide political options
when one does not want to escalate existing tensions into military
confrontation.]{.underline} **[Defensive coordination]{.underline}**
between allies through CYOC [supports such defensive use of cyber
effects, increasing the possibility that US Cyber Command will be
allowed to 'defend forward' and work persistently through allied
networks]{.underline}.73 **[A more cyber-active NATO,
however]{.underline}**, [risks being counterproductive to the ambition
to 'defend forward' through allied networks.]{.underline} [Unintended
conflict escalation from ongoing cyber activity is mainly a risk if
military analysts---in a strategic environment with heightened attention
to military confrontation---ignore the dominant intelligence norm. If
that happens, it becomes more likely that]{.underline} 'persistent
[engagement']{.underline} and active cyber defence **[will be
misinterpreted]{.underline}** [as military preparation, armament or the
initial phase of an attack.]{.underline} [If NATO, an organization that
has publicly returned to]{.underline} its original raison d'être of
deterrence and [collective defence,]{.underline} [becomes the entity
that coordinates cyber effects below the threshold of armed
conflict]{.underline}, **[then the likelihood increases that Russia
misinterprets these effects as escalatory and acts
accordingly]{.underline}**. In other words, **[a more active
NATO]{.underline}** [in the current strategic environment]{.underline}
**[increases the risk]{.underline}** [that the existing intelligence
norm will be undermined and replaced by a more militarized
norm.]{.underline} This does not mean that states that face hostile
hybrid activities below the threshold of armed conflict will be left
alone. Intelligence cooperation between allied countries does exist, and
threat information is occasionally shared. In addition to the current
political collaboration facilitated by NATO to improve network security
and resilience, the EU is engaging in similar civilian activities, as
well as developing and implementing a cyber-diplomatic toolbox to create
a common basis for responding to a variety of malicious activities
against member states. Further strengthening the political partnership
between the EU and NATO is thus the most appropriate way forward to
avoid further militarization of cyberspace. Sustaining the intelligence
norm as the dominant norm is not without potential problems. Openly
embracing the fact that cyberspace is a domain in which intelligence
agencies are constrained only by domestic laws, and where takedowns of
servers in foreign countries are not necessarily perceived as serious
breaches of sovereignty, is likely to lead to an increase in the
exploitation of IT vulnerabilities in commercial software used in both
enemy and allied networks. For smaller states, this could increase the
risk of retaliation by larger adversaries, and it could increase the
risk of divisions between allies---divisions that are not aligned with
the United States' political ambition to use cyber coordination in NATO
as part of its attempt to 'defend forward'.74 [More exploitation
could]{.underline} also ultimately [make cyberspace]{.underline} less
free, less open and less secure, rendering civilian populations
[susceptible to]{.underline} cybercrime, surveillance and
[disruptions]{.underline} of everyday services.75 [This is
why]{.underline} some [states]{.underline}, [NGOs and private
corporations]{.underline} such as Microsoft [continue to promote norms
that **emphasize restraint**]{.underline} [on the part of
state]{.underline}s' intelligence agencies and militaries in
[cyberspace]{.underline}, and why other states promote more sovereign
control of cyberspace.76 Conclusion This article has pointed to several
challenges to the [integration of military cyber effects in NATO
operations,]{.underline} and has argued that [even if]{.underline} the
integration is [successful]{.underline}, it **[will not add to the
alliance's deterrence posture]{.underline}**. Importantly, the fact that
CYOC [does not send a strong signal to adversaries such as
Russia]{.underline} does not mean that it is a waste of time. Far from
it. As both conventional militaries and paramilitary groups are
increasingly dependent on civilian networked technologies, the ability
of NATO to disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy enemy networks through
sovereign cyber effects---even if these amount only to temporary
annoyances---will become more relevant in the years to come. This, of
course, does not mean that conventional kinetic or electromagnetic
capabilities will become redundant. Rather, cyber effects offer a
substitute in case the intended target cannot be reached with
conventional capabilities, and a supplement that works alongside
conventional operations as persistent annoyances of enemy networked
devices. The latter, however, demands an agile CYOC that provides member
states with broad initial mandates and facilitates quick decision-making
and rapid approval when member states stand ready to deliver even minor
cyber annoyances. Furthermore, the article has argued that
[NATO]{.underline} and its CYOC [**should not seek to coordinate
additional offensive cyber efforts** to deter hybrid
activities]{.underline} below the threshold of armed conflict. [If an
organization that is perceived by its main adversary primarily as a
military organization engages in active cyber-defence measures and
persistent cyber engagements outside of military confrontation**, then
the risk of escalation increases**.]{.underline} This is because [every
potential NATO-initiated cyber activity in foreign networks
is]{.underline} **[likely to be perceived through a military
lens]{.underline}** [and thus to be (**mis-)interpreted** as an attack
in the making.]{.underline} In fact, active cyber-defence measures in
foreign networks and use of cyber means below the threshold of armed
conflict to pursue political interests internationally are part of our
current reality. Intelligence agencies know this to be a fact, and they
live by it every day.

[One path towards escalation involves adversaries becoming **more
aggressive**]{.underline} [and conducting attacks that are **highly
disruptive to society**]{.underline}---in other words, adversary
[activity leads to a less stable cyberspace]{.underline}. This could be
the result of either an adversary's increased willingness to conduct
attacks using existing capacities or increased capacities of the
adversary. Indeed, with respect to the latter, [the U.S. vision---and
associated changed course of action]{.underline}---[may encourage other
actors to **grow their budgets to conduct offensive cyber
operations**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} proliferation
[literature]{.underline} on weapons of mass destruction **[has
extensively covered]{.underline}** [the role of special interests in
**stimulating demand for weapon development**.]{.underline} [This makes
it a strong possibility that the new U.S. vision can be used by those
**groups within a given country favoring a growing cyber command** to
justify and lobby for increased military spending.]{.underline}

A second possibility is that [increased U.S. offensive cyber
activity]{.underline} that operates below the threshold of armed attack
activity [**reduces the value of cyber norms** of behavior that support
a more stable cyberspace.]{.underline} Even today, some observers
believe that the [high level of offensive activity in
cyberspace]{.underline} today demonstrates quite forcefully that nations
find value in conducting such activity, and that such activity [points
to the difficulty of establishing a more peaceful cyber norms
regime.]{.underline} These observers argue that there is no reason to
expect that increasing the U.S. contribution to such activity worldwide
will make it easier to establish such a regime. Finally, a third
possibility is that increased [U.S. offensive cyber activity will
complicate diplomatic relations with allies and other nations whose
cyber infrastructures are used in support of such activity]{.underline}.

[Increased aggressiveness by adversaries could also result from
**growing incentives** to conduct offensive cyber operations of a
**highly disruptive nature**.]{.underline} [In this case, **heightened
aggressiveness** might be **a symptom of** the U.S. strategy **actually
being effective** in making the U.S. more powerful.]{.underline}
Consider, for example, the current war against the Islamic State: losing
territory and grip in the Middle East, the terrorist organization is
said to be keen to recruit followers in Europe and other places in the
world to conduct attacks outside of Iraq and Syria. These attempted mass
killings are a way to show that the group still needs to be feared and
potentially to help recruiting---but they do not change the balance of
power in the region. [Actors in cyberspace might become more noisy and
aggressive **purely to increase friction**]{.underline}, [gain attention
and so on ---and perhaps also **to influence** international public
opinion in ways that drive **the United States toward changing its
strategy**.]{.underline}

Finally, worst-case outcomes---that is, a United States that is less
powerful in cyberspace along with a less stable cyberspace---could stem
from a multitude of sources. One possibility is that [the United States
could overplay its hand in terms of cyber capabilities.]{.underline} The
[USCYBERCOM]{.underline} is operating in a space in which it [has to
seize the initiative against a large and ever-growing number of actors.
The dangers of fighting on multiple fronts]{.underline}---[even for the
most capable]{.underline} [actors]{.underline}---[are well
known]{.underline} from conventional warfare. As the number of potential
cyber "fronts" is much higher compared to conventional warfare, [the
risks of overextension have become much higher]{.underline} as well. The
Defense Department vision's explicit focus on Russia and China,
following the USCYBERCOM vision's silence on the issue of priorities,
makes us less concerned about this scenario ---though it is still a
possibility.

#### OCO's cause escalation with Russia over Ukraine

Second, [Western offensive cyber operations might **spark war.** U.S.
cyber espionage and operations against Putin]{.underline}, his cronies,
or Russia's military forces [will appear far more ominous to Putin if he
believes they are aimed at regime change]{.underline}. Could Putin turn
the other cheek if the United States were to electronically raid the
cryptocurrency wallets of Russia's sanctions-avoiding kleptocrats? He
[might feel the need to escalate his own cyber operations]{.underline}
as part of his own version of defending forward. **[Escalation could
happen on the battlefield as well]{.underline}**. [According to the New
York
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/us/politics/us-ukraine-weapons.html),
teams from U.S. Cyber Command are "in place to interfere with Russia's
digital attacks and communications." Other teams are almost certainly
collecting digital intelligence on the location and intent of Russian
combat forces. [The United States is sharing such intelligence with the
Ukrainians but [apparently not yet providing any real-time
targeting](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/biden-administration-walks-fine-line-intelligence-sharing-ukraine-rcna18542).]{.underline}
That may change soon, as the United States seeks to alleviate
intensifying attacks on civilians. And with his KGB-bred paranoia,
[Putin might already see the presence of U.S. defensive and intelligence
teams operating on or against Russian military networks as evidence of
direct U.S. involvement in the war.]{.underline} Confirming his apparent
belief that Ukraine is just a NATO puppet, this might force a response,
either inside or outside of cyberspace. Further, [if Western
governments]{.underline} have [infiltrated Russia's operational military
networks, they may feel pressure to disrupt those networks]{.underline}
to prevent civilian massacres. Because cyber capabilities are billed as
non-lethal, reversible, and non-escalatory, tub-thumping newspapers may
push decision-makers to take shots they might not otherwise: "We can't
create a no-fly zone but [can use cyber capabilities to prevent civilian
harm](https://mobile.twitter.com/Jason_Healey/status/1498416936891387912)."
Some [well-meaning national
leaders](https://twitter.com/JacquiHeinrich/status/1500961829509636099)
may succumb to this pressure, **[potentially causing a larger
conflict.]{.underline}** Future Risks [Even if Russia and the West avoid
direct conflict this time, they might not be so lucky the
next]{.underline}. As relations worsen, future disruption of critical
Western infrastructure by Russian intelligence, such as the
[NotPetya](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/technology/ransomware-hackers.html)
and [Olympic
Destroyer](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/technology/winter-olympic-games-hack.html)
attacks, are less likely to be viewed as mere crimes. Repeated crises
bordering on war may further erode the tacit agreements and relative
restraint of quieter times. After repeated iterations of intensifying
cyber operations, both Russia and the West may feel their backs to the
wall with few options left other than military force when the next
crisis --- physical or cyber --- emerges. Under extreme conditions, some
of the same characteristics that lead cyber capabilities to be a
pressure release might have the opposite effect, a mechanism that Bob
Jervis and I have described as the [Escalation
Inversion](https://tnsr.org/2020/09/the-escalation-inversion-and-other-oddities-of-situational-cyber-stability/).
If Putin believes a direct conflict with NATO is likely and expects its
adversaries to [take measures to reduce
vulnerabilities](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/a-new-era-in-u-s-russian-strategic-stability),

The Myth of the Offense

Contrary to observed patterns of limited disruption and espionage, Cyber
Command sees cyberspace as a domain fraught with increasing risk, where
great powers such as China and Russia will undermine American power. The
only solution, from this perspective, is to go on the offense. Yet, [the
benefits of an offensive posture]{.underline}, especially [in
cyberspace]{.underline}, [are]{.underline} mostly
**[illusory]{.underline}** to date. Instead, [the cyber domain tends to
be optimized for defense and deception]{.underline}, not decisive
offensive blows. [Not only is offense likely the weaker form of
competition in cyberspace]{.underline}, [it also **risks inadvertent
escalation**]{.underline}. [The fear]{.underline},
[suspicion]{.underline}, [and misperception that characterize interstate
rivalries **exacerbate** the **risk** of offensive action in
cyberspace]{.underline}.

[Cyber Command's 2018 persistent-action strategy aims to]{.underline}
"[expose adversaries' weaknesses]{.underline}, [learn their intentions
and capabilities]{.underline}, [and counter attacks close to their
origins]{.underline}."44 Put in simple terms, the best defense is a good
offense: get on adversary networks and stop cyber operations targeting
the United States before they occur. [Under this strategy]{.underline},
[offensive cyber operations will also be **preemptive**]{.underline} in
that they are designed to "contest dangerous adversary activity before
it impairs \[U.S.\] national power."45 To use another sports metaphor,
come out swinging. Go on the offense first and establish escalation
dominance (that is, demonstrating such superior capabilities over the
target state that it can't afford to escalate in response).46

According to Cyber Command, preemptive strikes will "impose . . .
strategic costs on our adversaries, compelling them to shift resources
to defense and reduce attacks."47 Whether through punishment, risk, or
denial strategies, offensive actions theoretically alter the target's
behavior by increasing the expected costs of targeting U.S. interests.48
Offensive action, according to this thinking, deters future aggression
by signaling resolve and establishing escalation dominance. Yet, [there
are well-established reasons to doubt that offensive options produce the
intended results in cyberspace]{.underline}.

Defense and Deception

[The rationale behind persistent action]{.underline}---[that the best
defense is a good offense]{.underline}---[is **deeply
flawed**]{.underline}. In fact, [most military and strategic theory
holds that the defense is the **superior posture**]{.underline}.49 For
example, Sun Tzu describes controlling an adversary to make their
actions more predictable, and hence easy to undermine, by baiting them
to attack strong points.50 [The stronger form of war is a
deception-driven defense]{.underline}: [confusing an attacker so that
they waste resources attacking strong points that appear
weak]{.underline}. This parallels cybersecurity scholars Erik Gartzke
and Jon Lindsay's claim that [cyberspace is **not offense
dominant**]{.underline}, [but **deception dominant**]{.underline}.51
Rather than persistent action and preemptive strikes on adversary
networks, [the United States needs **persistent deception**]{.underline}
[and **defensive counterstrikes**]{.underline} [optimized to **undermine
adversary planning**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[capabilities]{.underline}**.

Fear and the Security Dilemma

[New policy options proposed by Cyber Command]{.underline} and the Trump
administration **[risk exacerbating fear]{.underline}** in other
countries [and creating a **self-reinforcing spiral**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} **[tit-for-tat escalations]{.underline}** [that ri**sk
war** even though each actor feels]{.underline} [he is acting
defensively]{.underline}---or, as it is called in the scholarly
literature, a security dilemma.52 As shown above, most cyber operations
to date have not resulted in escalation. The cyber domain has been a
world of spies collecting valuable information and engaging in limited
disruptions that substitute for, as well as complement, more
conventional options. [Shifting to a policy of **preemptive offensive
cyber warfare** risks **provoking fear**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[overreaction]{.underline}** [in other states and possibly **producing
conflict spirals**]{.underline}. [Even]{.underline} limited-objective
cyber offensive action defined as "[defending forward]{.underline}" [can
be misinterpreted and lead to inadvertent escalation]{.underline}.53 As
the historian Cathal Nolan puts it, "intrusions into a state's
strategically important networks pose serious risks and are therefore
inherently threatening."54

More worryingly, [with a more offensive posture]{.underline}, [it will
be **increasingly difficult** for states]{.underline} [to differentiate
between cyber espionage and more damaging degradation
operations]{.underline}.55 What the United States calls defending
forward, China and Russia will call preemptive strikes. Worse still,
[this posture will likely lead great powers to assume all network
intrusions]{.underline}, including espionage, [are preparing the
environment for follow-on offensive strikes]{.underline}. According to
cybersecurity scholar Ben Buchanan, "in the \[aggressor\] state's own
view, such moves are clearly defensive, merely ensuring that its
military will have the strength and flexibility to meet whatever comes
its way. Yet potential adversaries are unlikely to share this
perspective."56 [The new strategy risks producing a]{.underline}
"**[forever cyber war]{.underline}**" [prone to **inadvertent
escalation**]{.underline} [because it implies all cyber operations
should be interpreted as escalatory by adversaries]{.underline}.57

The Myth of Decisive Cyber Victory

[There is a tendency in the military profession]{.underline}, at least
in the United States and Europe, [to uphold the concept of decisive
battle as central to the Western way of war]{.underline}.58 Often,
[disruptive technologies]{.underline}---from strategic bombers in the
mid-20th century to cyber operations in the 21st century---[are seen as
providing decisive offensive advantages in crises]{.underline}. In the
interwar period between the world wars, airpower enthusiasts argued that
bombers would reliably reach their targets, forcing political leaders to
end hostilities or face the prospect of destroyed cities and economic
collapse.59

[Yet the search for decisive battle is]{.underline} [often an
**elusive**]{.underline}, [if not **dangerous**]{.underline},
[temptation for military planners and policymakers]{.underline}. In a
comparative historical treatment of major 19th- and 20th-century
battles, Nolan argues that "[often]{.underline}, [war results in
something clouded]{.underline}, [neither triumph nor
defeat]{.underline}. [It is an arena of **grey outcomes**]{.underline},
[partial and ambiguous resolution of disputes and causes that led to the
choice of force as an instrument of policy in the first
place]{.underline}."60 Decisive victories in any one battle are rare.
Adversaries can refuse to fight.61 They can even signal resolve through
demonstrating their ability to endure pain.

Planning and Assessment Pathologies

[The]{.underline} [new policy framework for offensive cyber operations
**risks compounding common pathologies**]{.underline} [associated with
strategic assessments and planning]{.underline}. 62 **[Removing
interagency checks]{.underline}** [increases the risks that an operation
will **backfire** on the attacker]{.underline} [or **compromise ongoing
operations**]{.underline}.

[**Misperception** is **pervasive**]{.underline} [in insulated
decisionmaking processes]{.underline} for several reasons.63 First,
[small groups unchecked by bureaucracy tend]{.underline} [to **produce
narrow plans**]{.underline} [prone to escalation during
crises]{.underline}.64 Second, [leaders often give guidance to planners
during crises]{.underline} [that reflects their political
bias]{.underline} [or personality traits rather than a rational
assessment]{.underline} of threats and options.65 Third, [offensive bias
in planning may have little to do with the actual threat and more to do
with a **cult of the offensive**]{.underline} [and the desire of
officers to ensure]{.underline} [their autonomy and
resources]{.underline}.66 Removing interagency checks therefore risks
compounding fundamental attribution errors and other implicit biases.
Cyber operations are too important to be left to the generals at Cyber
Command alone.

### Zero-Days Bad\-\--1NC

#### Sharing zero-days with allies causes use-it-or-lose-it pressure\-\--accelerates conflict escalation 

**Smeets '22** \[Max; May 31; Senior Researcher at the Center for
Security Studies (CSS) at ETH Zurich, co-founder and Director of the
European Cyber Conflict Research Initiative (ECCRI.eu), an organization
promoting the interdisciplinary study of cyber conflict and statecraft
in Europe and beyond, also an Affiliate at Stanford University Center
for International Security and Cooperation; CFR, "The Risks of Managing
a Purchased Cyber Arsenal,"
<https://www.cfr.org/blog/risks-managing-purchased-cyber-arsenal>\]

We know that some government agencies are regular buyers on the market
for zero-days, previously unknown vulnerabilities which vendors have not
had time to prepare a patch for. Zero-days, and their use by threat
actors, are a common topic, but how zero-day purchases complicate
arsenal management decisions is rarely discussed. Not least, buying
zero-day exploits, rather than developing them internally, increases the
chances of early discovery due to potential non-exclusive sales (even if
the exploit was supposed to be sold to only one buyer) which
subsequently incentivizes the imprudent use of the exploits.

Types of exploits and their life span

Exploits come in three main flavors: zero-day exploits (those that use a
vulnerability previously unknown to the vendor), unpatched N-day
exploits (those that use a vulnerability in software or hardware that is
known to the vendor but does not have a patch in place to fix the flaw),
and patched N-day exploits (those that use a vulnerability in software
or hardware that is known to the vendor and has a patch in place to fix
the flaw).

Zero-days are the most powerful form of exploit, because companies and
governments have no warning that a vulnerability may exist or any plans
to patch the vulnerability. Whilst this makes zero-days particularly
useful for penetrating computers and networks, note that mature cyber
commands and intelligence organizations still primarily use known
exploits for their operations.

[The average life span of a zero-day exploit]{.underline}--i.e., [before
the exploit gets discovered--is long: seven years, according to a study
from RAND Corporation. However, there is major variation; on average,
about 25 percent of all exploits do not survive for more than one and a
half years]{.underline}, but another 25 percent will survive more than
nine and a half years.

The risk of co-discovery

[The likelihood that two]{.underline} (or more) [independent parties
will discover a vulnerability is known as the vulnerability **collision
rate**]{.underline}. A RAND study found that, [for a given stockpile of
zero-day vulnerabilities, **after a year**, almost 6 percent have been
publicly discovered and disclosed by another entity.]{.underline}

Normally, [this risk of co-discovery drives **semi-calculated
decisions** about exploit use. A threat actor may, for example, decide
to only go after the most valuable victims or keep exploits for some
unusual circumstances]{.underline} to avoid discovery. In fact, we know
from the Snowden leaks that the National Security Agency (NSA) developed
"FOXACID", a tool to help optimize exploit use. FOXACID is an "exploit
orchestrator," a tool that automatically matches targeted computer
systems with different types of exploits. As Bruce Schneier, a computer
expert, notes, FOXACID "is designed to be modular, with flexibility that
allows \[NSA's Office of Tailored Access Operations (TAO), now Computer
Network Operations,\] to swap and replace exploits if they are
discovered, and only run certain exploits against certain types of
targets. The most valuable exploits are saved for the most important
targets. [Low-value exploits are run against technically sophisticated
targets]{.underline} where the chance of detection is high."

The risk of co-sales

[However, when an intelligence agency or cyber command buys
exploits]{.underline}, rather than develops them internally, [it further
complicates the decision-making process around their usage]{.underline}.
A buyer, like the NSA, can either purchase an 'exclusive' or
'non-exclusive' exploit. Exclusive purchases mean that the exploit is
only sold to one client and is thus pricier. Vice versa, non-exclusive
exploits can be sold to multiple clients and are cheaper.

In the case of non-exclusive sales, the client has thus to take into
consideration the chances that the exploit is sold to one or more other
clients, and whether others who buy the exploit will use it discreetly.

A tragedy of the commons

[A popular concept in economics is the "tragedy of the commons,"
a]{.underline} situation in which individuals who have access to an
open-access or unregulated resource, such as ocean fish stock, act
independently according to their own self-interest and, contrary to the
benefit of all users, cause depletion of the resource through their
uncoordinated actions.

[A non-exclusive exploit is not an open-access resource unhampered by
shared social structures]{.underline}. But sales of exploits to
independent actors--i.e., not knowing who else owns the exploit--does
create similar incentives to use the resource imprudently. **[It
incentivizes "use it or lose it"]{.underline}** behavior, [the belief
that an exploit should be **used quickly before it becomes
ineffective.**]{.underline}

This additional risk is also nonzero in the case of exclusive sales;
there is no certainty that the broker does not sell it on to other
actors, or that the developer does not shop it around to multiple
brokers. These latter risks, however, are minimized in the case of
trusted channels that carry repeated transactions between developer and
broker, or broker and end user buyer.

[Buying exploits can be convenient]{.underline}. [It may lead to
targeting options that are not otherwise available. Yet, it also further
complicates the decision-making of government agencies that use these
purchased capabilities and **introduces additional risk into the already
fraught world of cybersecurity**]{.underline}.

[There is a widespread view]{.underline} among practitioners and
scholars [that cyberspace is defined by an inherent potential for
dangerous escalation dynamics between rivals]{.underline}.1 On the
practitioner side, for example, senior US intelligence and military
leaders expressed concerns about first-strike incentives leading to
escalation in a 2017 joint statement to Congress, testifying that
"adversaries equipped with \[offensive cyber capabilities\] could be
prone to preemptive attack and rapid escalation in a future crisis,
because both sides would have an incentive to strike first."2 On the
academic side, [there is a palpable fear that cyberspace is an
environment in which offense has advantages over defense and that
this]{.underline}---[coupled with factors such as problems of
attribution, poor command and control, and the absence of meaningful
thresholds or red lines]{.underline}---[generates real risks of
inadvertent escalation.]{.underline}3 Concerns about escalation grew
even more passionate in the wake of the US Department of Defense's
release of its 2018 Cyber Strategy document, which articulates an
operational concept of "defending forward" in which the DOD
"disrupt\[s\] or halt\[s\] malicious cyber activity at its source."4
[However, there are **important empirical reasons** to **suspect** that
the risks of cyber escalation may be **exaggerated**]{.underline}.
[Specifically, if cyberspace is in fact an environment that]{.underline}
(perhaps even more so than others) [generates severe escalation risks,
why has cyber escalation **not yet occurred?**]{.underline} Most
[interactions]{.underline} [between cyber rivals have been characterized
by limited volleys that have not escalated beyond nuisance levels and
have been largely contained below the use-of-force
threshold]{.underline}.5 For example**[, in a survey of cyber
incidents]{.underline}** [and responses between 2000 and
2014,]{.underline} Brandon Valeriano et al. find that ["rivals tend to
respond only to lower-level \[cyber\] incidents and the response tends
to **check the intrusion as opposed to seek escalation
dominance.**]{.underline} [The majority of cyber escalation episodes are
at a low severity threshold and are non-escalator]{.underline}y. These
incidents are usually '[tit-for-tat' type **responses within one step of
the original incident**]{.underline}."6 [Even in the two rare examples
in which states employed kinetic force in response]{.underline} to
adversary cyber operations---the US counter-ISIL drone campaign in 2015
and Israel's airstrike against Hamas cyber operatives in 2019---[the use
of force was **circumscribed** and **did not escalate** the overall
conflict]{.underline} ([not to mention that force was used against
nonstate adversaries with limited potential to meaningfully
escalate]{.underline} in response to US or Israeli force).7 We posit
that [cyber escalation has not occurred because **cyber operations are
poor tools of escalation.**]{.underline} In particular, we argue that
[this stems from key characteristics of]{.underline} offensive [cyber
capabilities that limit escalation through four mechanisms. First,
retaliatory offensive cyber operations may not exist at the desired time
of employment. Second, even under conditions where they may exist, their
effects are uncertain and often relatively limited. Third, several
attributes of offensive cyber operations generate important tradeoffs
for decision-makers that may make them hesitant to employ capabilities
in some circumstances. Finally, the alternative of cross-domain
escalation---responding to a cyber incident with noncyber, kinetic
instruments---is unlikely to be chosen except under rare circumstances,
given the limited cost-generation potential of offensive cyber
operations. In]{.underline} this article, we define cyber escalation and
then explore the implications of the technical features and requirements
for offensive cyber operations. We also consider potential alternative
or critical responses to each of these logics. Finally, we evaluate the
implications for US policy making.

[The cyberspace competition is an intelligence contest]{.underline} in a
technologically novel domain. It [is a struggle to protect
information]{.underline}, [while corrupting and stealing information
from rivals]{.underline}. [Because it is not a test of overt military
power]{.underline}, **[traditional strategic theories]{.underline}**
about force and war [may not]{.underline} [be our best
guide.]{.underline}

**[Deterrence is mostly irrelevant]{.underline}** [in an intelligence
contest]{.underline}. [No combination of threats and promises will stop
a rival intelligence service from collecting information]{.underline}.
Nor is it easy to imagine what kind of signals would be strong enough to
stop adversaries from influence activities such as those of Russia
during the [2016
election](https://warontherocks.com/2018/02/obama-stopped-election-hack/) in
the United States. [Covert action is inherently **hard to deter** if the
responsible party remains **hidden**]{.underline}. And in other cases,
[states might tacitly tolerate one another's covert campaigns as
a **[safer
substitute](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/13238.html) for
war**]{.underline}. Similarly, [the **coercive value of offensive cyber
operations** is likely to be **modest at bes**t]{.underline}. [There is
not much evidence]{.underline} [that non-kinetic threats are enough to
change anyone's
behavior]{.underline}. **[[Recent](https://warontherocks.com/2017/08/are-cyber-weapons-too-dangerous-to-use/) [research](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3104014) suggests]{.underline}**
that the [victims are **surprisingly tolerant** of cyber
operations]{.underline}. **[Strategy is fundamentally about coercion,
but cyberspace operations carry little coercive value.]{.underline}**

There are some exceptions. It is possible to deter significant
cyberspace operations against critical infrastructure, for instance,
because such operations require a great deal of time, money, and
organization. They would invite a ferocious response, making deterrent
threats inherently credible. The language and logic of strategy is
useful here.

But in most cases [the logic of intelligence is more
appropriate]{.underline}. It [helps to explain why the balance of
capabilities is hard to assess]{.underline}. Long-term intelligence
contests are not easy to measure, not least because the contestants work
in secret. The relative position of rival intelligence services does not
lend itself to quantitative measures. [Who is "winning" an intelligence
contest at any given moment is rarely clear.]{.underline}

[To understand why, imagine having unfettered access to all the
intelligence collected by two great power rivals]{.underline}. In this
idealized setting, it might be possible to judge which side had
collected the most. It might also be possible to determine which side
had penetrated more difficult targets. But even here [it
would]{.underline} still [difficult to judge winners and losers, because
possessing information is not the same as understanding it.]{.underline}
[Intelligence services struggle to interpret data]{.underline}, [and the
more they collect, the more they face the challenge of separating
meaningful information from background noise. It is also difficult to
put technical knowledge of adversary capabilities to use. It is one
thing to steal intellectual property, for instance, and quite another to
reverse engineer it.]{.underline} Finally, [comparing the volume of
intelligence says nothing about the quality of intelligence-policy
relations. Intelligence services may perform admirably and still be
ignored.]{.underline}

Looking through the intelligence lens puts the [cyberspace
competition]{.underline} in perspective, but it [requires a willingness
to live with ambiguity.]{.underline} **[Signs that one side seems to be
winning may be misleading. Breathless headlines about the latest cyber
penetration]{.underline}** [may]{.underline}
**[exaggerate]{.underline}** [the extent to which one intelligence
service is racing ahead, or whether it is able to translate successful
cyberspace espionage into meaningful policy advantage]{.underline}.
Viewing the competition as an intelligence contest [puts]{.underline}
alarming headlines about

Key features of cyber operations---the role of access, nonuniversal
lethality of offensive cyber capabilities, and the temporal nature of
access and capability development and maintenance---may dramatically
circumscribe the escalatory options available to states through cyber
means during a time of crisis. First, [**escalatory cyber response**
options may simply **not be available** to a state because it lacks
access to an appropriate set of targets against which to deliver an
escalatory response.]{.underline} This is because [offensive cyber
operations deliver effects against targets through exploiting a
vulnerability to gain access]{.underline} (through an attack vector) to
a target's network or system and deliver a payload that is activated by
communicating back with a host or triggered by a command order written
into the code.13 Absent the right access to deploy a capability, the
latter might as well not exist.14 While critical to the success of
offensive operations[, the initial penetration of a target network or
system can be **resource intensive and net unpredictable results**,
which is why the employment of cyber capabilities that rely on access to
a targeted network require prior planning and resource
allocation]{.underline} Indeed, according to Chris Inglis, the planning
staff at US Cyber Command during the 2009--10 period assessed that "the
first [90 percent of]{.underline} cyber reconnaissance (i.e., ISR),
cyber defense, and [cyberattack]{.underline} [consisted of]{.underline}
the common work of [finding and fixing a target of interest]{.underline}
in cyberspace."15 Therefore, rather than occurring at lightning speed,
[cyber operations have crucial aspects that take time and significant
resource investments]{.underline}, even if at the tactical level a line
of code can indeed be executed at "network speed."16 Considering means
of access and types of targets reveal the various aspects of gaining
access that limit potential cyber escalatory responses at a given time.
Table 2, Mainstream means of gaining access, depicts various common
access methods and evaluates them along a spectrum of cost, risk, and
reliability.17 The broadest distinction between means of access is
remote (e.g., using the Internet) versus close (e.g., gaining access
through a human agent or supply chain interdiction). [Most of the
low-cost and low-risk means of gaining access to a target]{.underline}
(such as through various social engineering mechanisms) **[are not
readily applicable against more hardened]{.underline}** (and therefore
more strategically valuable) [**targets**, such as]{.underline} the
**[air-gapped networks]{.underline}** common [in critical infrastructure
systems and]{.underline} some [military]{.underline} and defense
[systems]{.underline}. [Conversely,]{.underline} the most reliable type
of access, [physical access through a human intermediary]{.underline} on
the ground, [is]{.underline} also [the **riskiest and
costliest**]{.underline}. The nature of the targeted network or system
also shapes access requirements and consequent level of difficulty. For
instance, gaining access to operational technology (OT) is typically
more difficult than to information technology (IT), although this may be
changing as IT and OT systems converge.18 OT networks tend to be closed
(they do not touch the global Internet) and run unique protocols used to
control highly specific processes and systems.19 Typically, these
characteristics also mean that these networks require specific knowledge
because the programs they run are customized to those systems and the
networking protocols they employ may not be widely proliferated.
Additionally, the simple fact of "gaining access" to a target network
does not guarantee that an attacker has gained access at the requisite
network layer from which to launch an offensive operation.20 Thus, most
access operations are followed by operations that enable persistence
through access escalation prior to the employment of any cyber weapon.
Finally, gaining access to a target via a hardware implant--- the actual
physical components of a computer (e.g., motherboard, USB and other
flash memory devices, routers, etc.)---is appreciably costlier and more
difficult than gaining access to software (all of the digital programs
on a computer, from the operating system to applications such as
Microsoft Word).

\*TABLE OMITTED\*

21 Software vulnerabilities are relatively easier to detect and to
patch, and manufacturers routinely disseminate information about known
vulnerabilities and remediation protocols.22 Second, in addition to
being dependent on access, offensive cyber capabilities lack universal
effectiveness. While nuclear or conventional munitions are target
agnostic---in most cases, the same munition can be used to target an
aircraft hangar, a massed enemy formation, a munitions factory, or a
hospital---some [cyber weapons must be **tailored to a specific target**
set or type]{.underline}.23 As Martin Libicki notes, "[A piece of
malware that brings one system down may have absolutely no effect on
anothe]{.underline}r. [The difference between the two]{.underline} [may
be as simple as **which patch version**]{.underline} of a piece of
software [each system runs]{.underline}."24 The 2017 WannaCry ransomware
attack that wreaked billions of dollars in damage and was attributed to
North Korea's Lazarus Group, for instance, targeted hundreds of
thousands of computers around the world across a range of industries
that were running an older version of Windows.25 The widespread damage
belies the highly specific and targeted nature of the malware---almost
all of the affected systems were running a version of Windows 7; the
same strain of malware had no effect on computers running more
up-to-date operating systems. Moreover, [asset owners of **targets of
strategic significance**]{.underline}---such as critical
infrastructure---[typically employ **highly customized software** and
specific hardware with **tailored configurations**]{.underline} that are
[**unique** to those systems]{.underline} and usually only intimately
understood by the original developers and manufacturers. It has been
reported, for example, that the malware employed in the Stuxnet
cyberattacks against the Iranian nuclear program was tailored to target
the specific model of Siemens programmable logic controllers (PLC) used
at the Natanz enrichment facility.26 Indeed, while Stuxnet was
discovered in computers around the world, it delivered destructive
effects only against the centrifuges in Natanz.27 The
[non-substitutability of entire classes of offensive capabilities by
definition increases the cost of developing an arsenal of offensive
cyber capabilities]{.underline}.28 Therefore, [**the time and resource
requirements** to gain access and develop specific offensive
**capabilities may render important escalatory response options
infeasible or** impractical at the desired time.]{.underline}
Operational planning and execution must consider that a given capability
may not be usable or even exist at a chosen time of employment.29 As the
above discussion illustrates[, many of the target]{.underline} sets that
would represent strategic (and therefore escalatory) targets, [such
as]{.underline} a state's critical infrastructure or [**nuclear command
and control**, demand extensive]{.underline} planning, [pre-positioning,
and capability development]{.underline} in advance of employing
offensive capabilities. [Therefore, the timing of a crisis plays a
crucial role in decisions about cyber escalation responses]{.underline}.
[Specifically, the time required to develop access]{.underline} to hold
strategic targets at risk [means that, even if a state seeks to escalate
against an adversary using cyber means]{.underline}, **[it may find
itself limited by the accesses and capabilities it possesses at the
moment a crisis occurs.]{.underline}** [Cyber response options may be
limited to **less decisive** or more vulnerable **target sets**, rather
than those that are more strategically significant]{.underline}. Third,
[these limitations become even more salient when we consider how
strategic interactions are likely to play out **over** **time during
repeated crisis interactions**]{.underline}. Because [the virtual domain
is changeable in a way that the physical world is not,]{.underline}
[actions taken by defende]{.underline}rs in the context of a crisis
**[can radically and unpredictably alter]{.underline}** an [attacker's
ability to deliver]{.underline} and sustain [effects]{.underline}
against a target over time.30 [Access and capabilities are neither
guaranteed nor indefinite]{.underline}---they have a shelf life.31
[Footholds]{.underline} into a target's network that were time intensive
to develop [can]{.underline} unexpectedly [disappear as]{.underline}
vulnerabilities in a [network are patched]{.underline}. Exploits may
have a short shelf life as revealing information about them enables
targets to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs) and use these to
prevent further damage from specific malware strains or quarantine
malicious traffic using known malware signatures. An example of the
latter is the US Cyber Command initiative, beginning in 2018, to share
information about adversary malware by uploading samples to
VirusTotal.32 Therefore, [a target can "transition from vulnerability
(to a particular attack) to invulnerability **in, literally,
minutes**]{.underline}."33 Third-party disclosure about software
vulnerabilities by governments or private actors can also
unintentionally precipitate the loss of access as exposure about
vulnerability information enables [network defenders]{.underline} to
[take measures to remedy]{.underline} them.34 For instance, the
disclosures that began in 2016 by the group Shadow Brokers of
purportedly pilfered US National Security Agency exploits and zero days
ostensibly put US government accesses at risk.35 Put simply, a
[vulnerability]{.underline} upon which an access relies may in theory be
[only one update or disclosure away from being patche]{.underline}d.
Thus, [in the context of an ongoing crisis interaction between an
attacker and defender, the former's operational tempo is likely to be
interrupted by the latter's behavior,]{.underline} forcing the attacker
to devote additional time to find or acquire new vulnerabilities and
exploits in the midst of an offensive operation or campaign. As Inglis
notes, to succeed in an offensive cyber campaign that unfolds over time,
attackers must be able to sustain "the efficacy of tools under varying
conditions caused by the defender's response and the natural variability
and dynamism of cyberspace."36 [The ability to build or acquire new
accesses and capabilities "in real time" during a crisis is **highly
limite**d]{.underline}.37 Indeed, General Paul Nakasone remarked in a
January 2019 interview on the radical difference in shelf life between
conventional and cyber capabilities: Compare the air and cyberspace
domains. Weapons like JDAMs \[ Joint Direct Attack Munitions\] are an
important armament for air operations. How long are those JDAMs good
for? Perhaps 5, 10, or 15 years, sometimes longer given the adversary.
When we buy a capability or tool for cyberspace . . . we rarely get a
prolonged use we can measure in years. Our capabilities rarely last 6
months, let alone 6 years. This is a big difference in two important
domains of future conflict.38 Therefore, as a 2013 Defense Science Board
report notes, "[offensive cyber]{.underline} will always be a [fragile
capability]{.underline}" [when pitted against]{.underline} network
defenders who are "continuously improving network [defensive tools and
techniques]{.underline}."39

[[For **decades** there has been]{.underline}]{.mark} almost
[wall-to-wall [alarm about]{.mark}]{.underline} the dangers supposedly
inherent in [nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline}.

[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline}
of nuclear weapons [[has been **far slower** than]{.mark} has been
commonly [predicted]{.mark} over]{.underline} the [decades]{.underline}
primarily because [the [weapons do not]{.mark} generally [convey]{.mark}
much [advantage]{.mark} to their possessor]{.underline}.

And, more importantly, [the [effect of]{.mark} the
[prolif]{.mark}eration [that has taken place has
been]{.mark}]{.underline} substantially [[**benign**: those who]{.mark}
have [acquired the weapons]{.mark} have "[used"
them]{.mark}]{.underline} simply [[to stoke]{.mark} their [egos
or]{.mark} to [deter real or imagined threats]{.mark}]{.underline}.67
[The holds [even for]{.mark} the [prolif]{.mark}eration of the weapons
[to **large, important countries run by**]{.mark} **unchallenged
[monsters]{.mark}**]{.underline} who at the time they acquired the bombs
were certifiably deranged: [Josef Stalin]{.underline} who in 1949 was
planning to change the climate of the Soviet Union by planting a lot of
trees, and [Mao Zedong]{.underline} who in 1964 had just carried out a
bizarre social experiment that had resulted in artificial famine in
which tens of millions of Chinese perished.68

Despite this experience, an aversion to nuclear proliferation continues
to impel alarmed concern, and it was a chief motivator of the Iraq War
which essentially was a militarized antiproliferation effort. The war
proved to be a necessary cause of the deaths of more people than were
inflicted at Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.69

The subsequent and consequent Iraq syndrome strongly suggests [[there
will be little incentive to apply military force to prevent]{.mark}, or
to deal with, [further]{.mark} putative
[prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline}. Thus, despite nearly continuous
concern---even at times hysteria---about nuclear developments in North
Korea and Iran, proposals to use military force (particularly boots on
the ground) to deal with these developments have been persistently
undercut. The invasion of Iraq presumably did prevent that country from
going nuclear---assuming it ever would have been able to put together
the effort.70 However, it scarcely seems likely that there will be much
sympathy for repeating that disastrous experience. Thus, [maintaining
huge forces-in-being to deal with the proliferation problem scarcely
seems sensible]{.underline}, even though almost everybody still
considers proliferation to be major security concern. [[What
seems]{.mark} to be [required]{.mark} in these cases]{.underline}, as
generally with the devils du jour of the Cold War era, [[is]{.mark}
judicious, [watchful]{.mark}, and wary [patience]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Other analysts have sounded a much less alarmist tone, however. Some
scholars even suggested that **[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**n Iranian
[[bomb held]{.mark} great pot[ential for
**stabilising**]{.mark}]{.underline} [an]{.underline}
**[unbalanced]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[volatile]{.underline}** [Middle East]{.underline} (Waltz, 2012).
Closer to the mainstream of Western strategic discourse, various experts
have argued that [[despite]{.mark} the **[risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[of proliferation, nuclear weapons, and the **[deterrent]{.mark}** they
provide]{.underline} should get (more) credit for
**[[contribut]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing, in combination with other
factors, [[to]{.mark} what has been labelled 'the]{.underline} **[[Long
Peace']{.underline}]{.mark}** [among the great powers since
1945]{.underline} (Gaddis, 1999, p. 268--271; Gavin, 2012a, p. 164;
Acton 2010, pp. 16--17). Still others have contended that
[[because]{.mark} nuclear **[prolif]{.mark}**eration [is]{.mark} such a
**[rare]{.mark}** phenomenon, [and]{.mark} since **[robust]{.mark}
nonprolif**]{.underline}eration [[measures]{.mark} **tend** to
be]{.underline} [**[disrupt]{.mark}**ive, [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[net]{.mark} destabilising [effect]{.mark}]{.underline}** [of new
nuclear countries [is]{.mark} **quite [small]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[and, therefore,]{.underline} **[manageable]{.underline}** (Mueller
2010, pp. 95--99; Hymans 2013, pp. 293--296). The question of whether
nuclear proliferation has stabilising or destabilising effects is not
just fascinating for scholars of the nuclear age, but also highly
consequential for practical policy issues. For in order to debate the
merits of particular policy choices -- such as preventive military
strikes against nuclear facilities, grand bargains with potential
proliferators or complete nuclear disarmament -- we need to understand
first how the spread of nuclear weapons impacts regional and global
security. The chapter proceeds in three steps. The first section
provides the foundation for the other parts by summarising what we know
about empirical patterns of proliferation and the utility of nuclear
weapons for statecraft. The second section then engages the literature
on the consequences of proliferation, focusing in particular on how
proliferation has influenced international stability. The final section
explores whether some states have been more affected than others, and
what measures these states have taken to prevent proliferation, or at
least mitigate its negative consequences. Patterns of nuclear
proliferation and the utility of nuclear weapons Nuclear proliferation
is commonly defined as the spread of nuclear weapons to states that did
not previously have them. Within a broader conceptual framework that is
rarely used by scholars, yet popular in the arms control community, this
diffusion of nuclear weapons to additional states is labelled horizontal
proliferation. It is conceptually accompanied by the notion of vertical
proliferation, which refers to qualitative improvements and increases in
the number of nuclear weapons in the stockpiles of existing nuclear
weapon states. In accordance with the typical usage of the term in the
scholarly debate, this chapter focuses only on how the horizontal
proliferation of nuclear weapons affects international stability. One
important empirical pattern that has shaped how nuclear proliferation is
understood concerns the way in which nuclear weapons have spread. [The
word]{.underline} **[['spread']{.underline}]{.mark}** [appears to
[suggest]{.mark} that the **established**]{.underline} nuclear
[[powers]{.mark} have]{.underline} [**[provide]{.mark}**d]{.underline}
[other interested nations with (at least a few) operational nuclear
[warheads.]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[Yet]{.mark} such transfers have
[never]{.mark} been undertaken.]{.underline}** [Certainly, states that
sought nuclear weapons have often received]{.underline} significant
**[assistance]{.underline}** from other nations (Schofield, 2014;
Fuhrmann, 2012), [sometimes in the form of]{.underline} highly sensitive
**[tech]{.underline}**nologies (Kroenig, 2010).
[Nonetheless,]{.underline} since **[[all]{.underline}]{.mark}** these
transfers [[remained]{.underline}]{.mark} **[well
[below]{.mark}]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} **[[weapons]{.mark}
threshold]{.underline}**, nations seeking nuclear weapons always had to
build them indigenously. Hence, [in reality, the spread of nuclear
weapons has meant that merely the **ambition**]{.underline} [to possess
a nuclear arsenal has spread]{.underline} to additional states, each of
which then had to pursue that goal primarily through indigenous efforts.
[Importantly, since a state's national [efforts]{.mark} to turn
its]{.underline} **[desire]{.underline}** for nuclear weapons
[into]{.underline} **[reality]{.underline}** [naturally
[span]{.mark}]{.underline} several (and sometimes **[[many)
years]{.underline}]{.mark}**, nuclear **[prolif]{.underline}**eration
[must be conceived of as a]{.underline} **[process]{.underline}**, as
opposed to just a single step (Meyer, 1986). This point is reinforced by
the fact that **[[29]{.underline}]{.mark}** out **[[of
39]{.underline}]{.mark}** states [[that]{.mark} have]{.underline}
**[[embarked]{.underline}]{.mark}** [upon that path]{.underline} (Müller
and Schmidt, 2010, p. 157; Mikoyan, 2012; Santoro, 2017)
[h[ave]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[not acquired]{.mark} a]{.underline}**
nuclear **[arsenal]{.underline}**. Hence, a lot of nuclear proliferation
activity has been undertaken by nations that did not ultimately become
nuclear weapon states. Three patterns explain this situation. First,
[[owing]{.underline}]{.mark} not just [[to]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[tech]{.mark}nological]{.underline}**, but also the
[**[institutional]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[managerial
challenges]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of the task]{.underline}, some
[[nations]{.mark} simply **[failed]{.mark} in their
efforts**]{.underline} to build the bomb (Hymans, 2012;
Braut-Hegghammer, 2016). Second, a few countries have chosen a nuclear
'hedging' strategy, intentionally confining their efforts to developing
the technological capability to build an arsenal quickly while
refraining from exercising that option (Narang, 2016--17, p. 134).
Third, [[several]{.mark} states have **[undertake]{.mark}**n a '[nuclear
**reversal'**, **abandoning**]{.mark}]{.underline} [their]{.underline}
nuclear [weapons [activities]{.mark}]{.underline} before developing
nuclear explosive devices (Müller and Schmidt, 2010).
