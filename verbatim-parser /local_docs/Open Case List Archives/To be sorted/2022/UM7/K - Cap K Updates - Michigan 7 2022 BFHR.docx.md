Luxurious war

Together, these [transformations constitute]{.underline} what I describe
**['luxurious war]{.underline}**,' [or a mode of war driven by the
**accumulation of excess** and the invention of new outlets of
**expenditure**]{.underline}. In my view, [luxurious war]{.underline}
ser[ves as a diagram for describing numerous developments in warfare
including a set of '**virtual'** dimensions of global war]{.underline}.
In general, [luxurious war]{.underline} [exhibits]{.underline} three
dynamics: (1) [the dissemination of expenditure into new **conflicts**,
**technologies**, and **military-economic** processes]{.underline}; (2)
[a **libidinal investment** in war as a mode of political
reproduction]{.underline}; [and]{.underline} (3) [the tendency towards
unruly outbursts of war in the form of '**careless'**
expenditure]{.underline}. A number of these dynamics have been described
in the emerging literature on critical war studies. The work of Michael
Dillon and Julian Reid (2000) and Miguel de Larrinaga and Mark Doucet
(2008), for instance, link Michel Foucault's (2003) and Giorgio
Agamben's (1998) discussions of the biopolitical to the tendency of
contemporary wars, to expose populations to death. In these accounts,
war increasingly deploys indiscriminate violence in order to preserve,
normalize, and regulate political life. Similarly, Vivienne Jabri's
(2006) work on the transformation of war, Mark Duffield's (2002)
description of networked war, and Leerom Medevoi's (2007) [exploration
of the expansion of military projects into civilian affairs all capture
the tendency of war to **infiltrate** traditional democratic structures
and convert them into vehicles for the expansion of **political
power**]{.underline}. These accounts describe the implications of the
slow diffusion of war into new practices, technologies, and political
structures. In addition, scholars such as Brad Evans and Michael Hardt
(2010) excavate the imbrications of contemporary war and liberal
capitalism and touch upon the connection between processes of
accumulation and the dissemination of new forms of war. In their view,
following Gilles Deleuze, [war no longer takes place as **interstate
war**, but as a form of continual **civil war** fostered and reproduced
by the **economic** and **political** dynamics of
**liberalism**.]{.underline} Bataille's development of luxurious war
provides a parallel explanation for the emergence of many of these
dynamics in contemporary war. However, it makes two distinctive
contributions to the literature on contemporary war. First, [luxurious
war focuses on the **material** and **libidinal** dimensions of
excess]{.underline}. Many critical accounts of warfare, in contrast,
discuss the rise of new practices of war in the context of political
governance, organizing rubrics, or schemas of understanding. For
Bataille, the concepts of organizing governance are important but
secondary to the material 'curse' of excess. In other words, [while new
forms of governmentality might reconceptualize the terrain of war, this
reconceptualization is produced from within the dynamics of the **solar
economy**]{.underline}. In this way, [Bataille provides a bridge between
changes in the material context of war and technologies of
governance]{.underline}. Second, [luxurious war treats **ontological**
or **topological** shifts in war as responses to the contingent
arrangement of excess]{.underline}. Although many developments in
critical war studies problematize these shifts, they subordinate the
unpredictable dimensions of war to political categories or divisions. In
contrast, Bata[ille views these shifts as a messy creative process
intrinsic to the search for **new modes of expenditure** in
war.]{.underline} In short, [luxurious war shows the wild becomings in
warfare, which often **surpass** technologies of political
governance.]{.underline} Several [trends in contemporary warfare
help]{.underline} to [illustrate]{.underline} these points: the
[diffusion of military and war-fighting capacity across the
globe]{.underline}, [the rise of '**riskless'** war]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} the [development of '**precision'** war]{.underline}.
Each of these [developments correspond to the features of luxurious
war]{.underline}: the [accumulation of **excess** and creation of new
modes of **expenditure**]{.underline}; [investment in war as a form of
**political reproduction**; and the tendency for **'careless'
expenditure**]{.underline}. According to many critical accounts of war,
[these developments arise in an effort to violently secure life by
discarding '**undesirable'** segments of the population]{.underline}.
For Bataille, [the constructs organizing sacrifice in political life
remain secondary to the virulent movements of excess and the demands of
expenditure]{.underline}. In this sense, [while a 'biopolitical'
description of war explains how political divisions expose certain
populations to death, luxurious war elaborates on why this death occurs
in **choppy**, **haphazard**, and **messy** forms of war.]{.underline}13
[Expenditure in]{.underline} the [dissemination of]{.underline} global
[military force takes a variety of forms]{.underline}. [In
the]{.underline} context of the [Cold War]{.underline}, for example,
Mary Kaldor's (1981, 4) work on The Baroque Arsenal describes how [the
superlative 'offspring of a marriage between private enterprise and the
state' proved costly in both **military** and **economic**
terms]{.underline}. For Bataille, t**[his is only part of the
story.]{.underline}** [The process of accumulation during the Cold War
promoted a variety of different forms of expenditure (including the
buildup of **unsustainable** arms in the **U**nited **S**tates and
Soviet Union]{.underline}) [such as the spread of **small
arms**]{.underline}, [the growth of **p**rivate **m**ilitary
**c**ontractor**s**, and the diffusion of **network** and
**technological** warfare]{.underline} (Duffield 2001). These
[developments, while heterogeneous in source and character, constituted
**new modes** of expenditure that promoted the rise of new conflicts and
processes wars]{.underline}. Even [this process]{.underline}, however,
[becomes linked to the accumulating dynamics of luxurious war, as
low-intensity conflicts slowly **integrate** into the functioning of the
global economic system]{.underline}. Indeed, a number of [subterranean
economies]{.underline} ([or]{.underline}, in Bataille's sense,
[restricted economies]{.underline}) [**thrive** on these
developments]{.underline} (Kaldor 2006). In this case, [the link between
war and the process of accumulation is largely
unremarkable]{.underline}. [Rather than expending in war, the
**investment** in war becomes **profitable**, linked to the very
capacity of states to grow.]{.underline} However, [the excesses
generated by such a system]{.underline} -- [pockets of **armed
resistance**, **insurgency**, **unanticipated consequences** of the
growth of global militaries]{.underline} -- also [create **new outlets**
for expenditure often inciting greater involvement by Western
militaries]{.underline} (Graham 2011; Duffield 2002). [Military
expenditure thus integrates with economic life, encouraging the
proliferation of **military force**, **technology**, and **new types of
conflict**.]{.underline} [These]{.underline}, in turn, occasionally
[induce other forms of expenditure in the form of military
intervention]{.underline}. In this sense, [the]{.underline} apparent
[costliness of contemporary wars such as Iraq may be read as a symptom
of luxurious war rather than as a strategic blunder]{.underline}
(Stiglitz 2008). The [growth of 'riskless' war]{.underline} also
[conforms to the structure of luxurious war.]{.underline} [Riskless
war]{.underline} takes a number of forms from [emphasiz]{.underline}ing
[network-centric war]{.underline}, **[unmanned]{.underline}** aerial
**[vehicles]{.underline}**, **[precision munitions]{.underline}**, [and
**enhanced targeting** devices]{.underline} (Bousquet 2010; Duffield
2002). While on the surface this concept has the ethical merit of
minimizing the casualties of armed conflict, there is little evidence to
support this claim (Shaw 2005). Moreover, [the ethical commitments
involved in this form of war come into conflict when the 'risk-free'
means of warfare end up repeatedly endangering human life]{.underline}.
As Patricia Owens (2003) has demonstrated, the normalization of
collateral violence and the distribution of risk in 'riskless' war are
decidedly uneven. However, for Bataille, [the 'productive' orientation
of luxurious war masks this effect, both because war's productivity
renders such violence insensible and because 'riskless' war merely
displaces the expenditure of war into new forms.]{.underline} Moreover,
'[risklessness' reveals the **libidinal** investment in luxurious war
because the very effort to abolish 'risk' implies the need to improve
the **productivity** of war, to extend war into **new
domains**.]{.underline} In other words, '[riskless' war strengthens the
attachment to war while expending excess into the process of reducing
'risk.]{.underline}' This [reduction of 'risk']{.underline}
[**paradoxically** enhances the 'utility' of war, as the damages of war
become increasingly peripheral.]{.underline} In this way, '[riskless'
forms of war deployed in humanitarian and military situations transform
'**accidents**,' '**misuses**,' or even '**uses'** of **violent
tech**nology into an acceptable element of freer less-violent global
society while simultaneously enhancing the attractiveness of war as a
solution to political problems.]{.underline} (Owens 2003). In the end,
[the tremendous energies expended in rendering war 'riskless' simply
**displace** and **conceal** the expenditures of war.]{.underline} This
[connects to another aspect of luxurious war]{.underline}: **[its
carelessness]{.underline}**. Many discussions of contemporary war focus
on the role of precision weaponry and the efficient calibration of new
technology (Bousquet 2010). As Judith Butler (2010) has pointed out,
this 'precision' only matters for particular lives that count. [The
'precision' of the technics of war is thus complemented by a
'carelessness' with respect to the deployment of precision technology.
This distribution is certainly organized, but it nonetheless renders
only particular lives as intelligible or worthy-of-care]{.underline}
(Kaag and Kaufman 2009). [This attenuation follows closely Bataille's
description of the dangers of a war that disavows excess in two
ways.]{.underline} On the one hand, [the tremendous expenditure on
technology]{.underline}, which was referred to above[, is used to
**refine** and **miniaturize** the destructive capacity of
weaponry]{.underline}. On the other hand, [the elimination of
expenditure in war also reduces the attentiveness to the horizon of war
since the 'precision' of technology supposedly resolves these
discrepancies.]{.underline} Consequently, ['carelessness' expands as a
dimension of war and the very omnipresence of '**precise'** methods of
warfare produces new forms of **anxiety**, **fear**, and political
**conflict**.]{.underline} In effect, [this **militarizes** the public
sphere]{.underline} (Jabri 2006) [because the scope of luxurious war
includes new domains of political life from disaster relief efforts to
routine police efforts]{.underline} (Duffield 2002). In this way, [the
expenditure of war becomes a central feature of political life as the
domains of military practice **permeate** both traditional armed forces
operations and humanitarian efforts. These]{.underline} three
[developments]{.underline} (the diffusion, risklessness, and
carelessness of war) [are]{.underline} [products of the **transformation
of war** into an **accumulative** activity.]{.underline} While
[luxurious war]{.underline} clearly engenders new conflicts, ethical
uncertainties, and militarized terrains, it also [spurs]{.underline} the
[creation of **new forms** of **political governance**]{.underline}. The
Responsibility to Protect is one example of a form of governance that
surfaces within this horizon of luxurious war. [The Responsibility to
Protect is a cluster of axioms that **invoke**, **reify**, **extend**,
and **augment flows** of luxurious war in relation to
humanitarianism]{.underline}. The dynamics of luxurious war therefore
structure the protocols, norms, and mandates of the Responsibility to
Protect and, consequently, luxurious war delimits the efficacy of
international humanitarianism.

**Nation states organize themselves in terms of axioms to maximize
accumulation from conflict -- this process normalizes warfare as a
constant experience of the political economy rendering all political
life obsolete if it fails to succumb to the axiomatic standard of
productivity**

Axiomatic responsibility While Bataille offers valuable insights into
the contingent evolution of warfare, he does not thoroughly discuss how
this evolution implicates efforts to govern war. In this regard, Deleuze
and Guattari's development of the concept of the axiomatic, which they
describe as a mode of governance emerging in response to the flux and
indeterminacy of global politics, provides a complement to Bataille's
theory of war. [The axiomatic explains how the choppiness of luxurious
war shapes the paradigm of **global governance**]{.underline}. For
Deleuze and Guattari (1986, 454), [an axiomatic 'deals directly with
purely **functional elements** and relations whose nature is not
specified, and which are immediately realized in highly varied domains
simultaneously]{.underline}.' In contrast, [classical conceptions of
sovereignty depend on a notion of **transcendent authority**, which
'**overcodes'** the activities ongoing within the boundaries of the
state]{.underline}. [The Responsibility to Protect's move away from the
classic articulation of **sovereignty** already alludes to its
**axiomatic** character]{.underline}. Indeed, read as an axiomatic, [the
Responsibility to Protect consists]{.underline} largely [of a series of
axioms that describe specific **functions**, **regulations**, or
**protocols** that determine whether or not a state respects its
population.]{.underline} In general, the [axioms]{.underline} of the
Responsibility to Protect [attempt to govern the excesses and swerves of
luxurious war]{.underline}. In doing so, [they repress the expenditure
of this excess]{.underline}, [which returns in the form of haphazard
military **expenditure**]{.underline}. For example, [many
advocates]{.underline} of the Responsibility to Protect d[ecry the
indeterminate status of the doctrine as a failure of international
governance]{.underline}. However[, the very indeterminacy of the
Responsibility to Protect reflects the **choppy**, **haphazard**, and
**situational tendencies** of luxurious war]{.underline}. Moreover, [the
indeterminacy]{.underline} of the Responsibility to Protect [enables the
provisional application of military power in response to emergent
conflicts]{.underline}. [The Responsibility to Protect thus responds to
the dissemination and multiplication of low intensity conflict via
military expenditure.]{.underline} The [incipient character of conflicts
within luxurious war is thus mirrored in the **conditional endorsement**
of military action]{.underline} by the Responsibility to Protect. In
this way, [the]{.underline} apparent [indeterminacy]{.underline} of the
Responsibility to Protect [is an expression of the mode of political
response suited to luxurious war.]{.underline} For example, while France
and Russia have both been criticized for abusing the indeterminacy of
the Responsibility to Protect in their respectively threatened and
actualized military interventions into Myanmar and Georgia (Bellamy
2010), this critique fails to recognize that in both these contexts the
ambiguity of the Responsibility to Protect enabled military expenditure
as a technique of global governance. Furthermore, both an [emergent
conflict and the process of military intervention are **manifestations**
of luxurious war because the deployment of military force is a mode of
**expenditure**, which serves to dampen or inhibit the expenditure
ongoing in a political conflict.]{.underline} [Military
action]{.underline} under the Responsibility to Protect thus conforms to
the structure of luxurious war, which [turns expenditure into a
mechanism for **accumulation**]{.underline}. In this sense, the
Responsibility to Protect takes up luxurious war as its key problematic,
but at the same time reinforces the dynamics of luxurious war.
Consequently, the debate centered on political authority misses how the
axioms of the Responsibility to Protect normalize conditions of
luxurious war via the indeterminate, decentralized, and open-ended
character of the doctrine.14 [When the ICISS]{.underline} (2001, 1)
[released its initial report on the **R**esponsibility **t**o
**P**rotect]{.underline} in 2001, [the commission clarified that the
report was intended to redress 'the full horror of inaction' in contexts
such as the **Rwanda**, **Bosnia**, and **Somalia**]{.underline}. The
**[R]{.underline}**esponsibility **[t]{.underline}**o
**[P]{.underline}**rotect [derived many of its central concepts from the
work of Francis Deng]{.underline} (1996, xi) [who argued, 'the notion of
sovereignty must be put to work and **reaffirmed** to meet the
challenges of the times in accordance with accepted standards of **human
dignity'**]{.underline} (see also Orford 2011, 5--17). For Deng, the
post-World War II system began a slow erosion of national sovereignty,
which compromised many conflict management efforts. [By characterizing
sovereignty as a **positive obligation**]{.underline},
[Deng]{.underline} (1996, 33) [claimed that any 'government that allows
its citizens to **suffer in a vacuum** of responsibility for moral
leadership cannot claim sovereignty in an effort to keep the outside
world from stepping in to offer protection]{.underline}.' Deng's work
referenced a series of struggles, initiated by Dag Hammarskjöld, to
expand the executive powers of the United Nations in order to address
conflicts surfacing in the wake of decolonization (Orford 2011). This
debate challenged the accepted understanding of sovereignty and placed
the question of global political authority at the center of
international dialog. The ICISS report appropriated Deng\'s work in
refashioning responsibility as the cornerstone of sovereignty (Orford
2011). While the release of the ICISS report was eclipsed by 11
September 2001, the report resurfaced at the 2005 United Nations World
Summit, which affirmed the principle that 'each individual State has the
responsibility to protects its populations from genocide, war crimes,
ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity,' and continued by stating
that 'the international community should, as appropriate, encourage and
help States to exercise this responsibility' (United Nations General
Assembly 2005). Most recently, the Responsibility to Protect appeared in
Security Council Resolution 1073, which reiterated 'the responsibility
of the Libyan authorities to protect the Libyan population and
reaffirming that parties to armed conflicts bear the primary
responsibility to take all feasible steps to ensure the protection of
civilians' (United Nations Security Council 2011). The current 'status'
of the Responsibility to Protect is difficult to locate precisely
(Bellamy 2011). While the concept was widely endorsed at the United
Nations, there have been few interventions based explicitly on the
principles of the Responsibility to Protect. In many cases, uses of the
Responsibility to Protect have been criticized as inconsistent with the
normative vision of the doctrine (Bellamy 2011; Evans 2008). [The
process of adopting the **R**]{.underline}esponsibility
**[t]{.underline}**o **[P]{.underline}**rotect [conforms to an axiomatic
logic of '**addition** and **subtraction**.']{.underline} [The axioms
of]{.underline} the **[R]{.underline}**esponsibility
**[t]{.underline}**o **[P]{.underline}**rotect [emerge as 'primary
statements,' on particular relationships in global politics. Axioms add
or subtract depending on their degree of responsiveness to the
**exigencies** of an emergent situation]{.underline}.15 [The
reconceptualization of sovereignty]{.underline} by Deng, for example,
[emerges in response to an apparent disjunction between the description
of sovereignty and the political power of developing
states.]{.underline} Similarly, [the decision to rely on]{.underline}
the **[R]{.underline}**esponsibility **[t]{.underline}**o
**[P]{.underline}**rotect [in the case of **NATO intervention** in
Libya, in spite of the African Union's opposition to military
involvement, demonstrates how the '**operational imperatives'** of one
axiom of the **R**esponsibility **t**o **P**rotect, in this case the
emphasis on multilateralism, is **replaced** by another
axiom.]{.underline} [The]{.underline} contingent [application
of]{.underline} the **[R]{.underline}**esponsibility
**[t]{.underline}**o **[P]{.underline}**rotect [is therefore not a
failure of legal execution]{.underline}, as Gareth Evans (2008, 35)
maintains, [but an **essential function** or practice of the form of
governance produced by the report]{.underline} (Grovogui 2012). The
ICISS (2001, 11) report supplies a number of axioms for describing
political danger. The Responsibility to Protect responds to the 'stark
and undeniable reality,' that 'millions of human beings remain at the
mercy of civil wars, insurgencies, state repressions, and state
collapse.' Each of these realities 'cannot be understood without
reference to such "root" causes as poverty, political repression, and
uneven distribution of resources' (ICISS 2001, 22). To solve these
deficiencies, the Responsibility to Protect proposes enhancing
democratic institutions by providing assistance such as election
monitoring, ensuring broad based power-sharing via party formation,
resolving economic deprivation using international loans and foreign
aid, encouraging international trade, creating independent judiciaries,
and training or educating domestic security forces (ICISS 2001, 22). The
report also suggests several procedures for responding to proximate
causes of conflict, including a number of diplomatic efforts,
fact-finding missions, positive trade incentives, financial sanctions,
conflict mediation, and legal action in the International Criminal Court
(ICISS 2001, 23). Together, this menu of options creates the opportunity
for 'disparate actors working strategically' to coordinate in preventing
conflict (ICISS 2001, 25). Despite this menu, the report never describes
the source of the 'stark and undeniable reality' of human insecurity.
While the report certainly highlights variables that contribute to human
insecurity, it links all of these variables to one location: the state.
Indeed, the report clarifies that this is 'a dangerous world,' rife with
'weaknesses of state structures and institutions in many countries,' and
internal conflicts 'made more complex and lethal by modern technology,'
which take place in 'desperate\[ly\] poor societies' where 'the state's
monopoly over the means of violence is lost' (ICISS 2001, 4). Human
vulnerability results from 'campaigns of terror,' 'state fragmentation,'
and inefficiencies in domestic markets that increase the value of
plundering precious resources (ICISS 2001, 4). This danger is global:
'in an interdependent world, in which security depends on a framework of
stable sovereign entities, the existence of fragile states, failing
states, states who through weakness or ill-will harbour those dangerous
to others...constitute a risk to people everywhere' (ICISS 2001, 5). The
report views state failure in two different ways. First, failure
corresponds to the violation of human rights, welfare, and dignities,
which signifies an abrogation of sovereignty by the state in question.
Second, failure results from democratic deficits in the structure of the
state. These two forms of failure complement one another. State failure
causes human insecurity and humanity insecurity reveals a failure in the
state (ICISS 2001, 23). Here, [the 'operative statement' of]{.underline}
the **[R]{.underline}**esponsibility **[t]{.underline}**o
**[P]{.underline}**rotect [refers to two dimensions of luxurious
war]{.underline}. On the one hand, the report argues that political and
economic forces undermine the state's capacity to protect its denizens.
T[he proliferation of **military forces**, the **permeable nature** of
**state boundaries**, and the **diffusion of arms characteristic** of
luxurious war reveal the impotence of state structures]{.underline}. On
the other, the report views state failure as capable of spreading or
circulating within an 'interdependent world.' In this way, the rise of
conflicts jeopardizes the accumulative dynamics of a global political
system. The [expenditure of excess in the form of humanitarian or
military force thus serves to buttress **accumulation** by reintegrating
a crisis zone into **normative economic relations**.]{.underline} In
this case, the **[R]{.underline}**esponsibility **[t]{.underline}**o
**[P]{.underline}**rotect [produces an **axiom** that relocates the
danger of luxurious war in the disintegration of state
authority]{.underline}. In doing so, the
**[R]{.underline}**esponsibility **[t]{.underline}**o
**[P]{.underline}**rotect also [establishes an axiom]{.underline},
[which supervenes the authority of the state in ubiquitous norms of
**human security**.]{.underline} Consequently, the [norms]{.underline}
of the Responsibility to Protect [apply to all states because the very
conditions of 'interdependence' outlined]{.underline} by the
Responsibility to Protect [constitutively undermine the
'**independence'** of any particular state.]{.underline} The [decision
to intervene]{.underline} thus [requires two]{.underline} supplementary
[axioms]{.underline}. First, [one directed towards **non-governmental
organizations**, **early warning networks**, and **reporting agencies**,
which supply the evidence that determines whether or not the norms
of]{.underline} the **[R]{.underline}**esponsibility
**[t]{.underline}**o **[P]{.underline}**rotect [go into
effect]{.underline}. These [organizations **thrive** in conditions of
luxurious war because they depend on imbrications of economic and
military relationships]{.underline} (Duffield 2002). Second, a [set of
'situational' axioms, such as UN Resolution 1073, that depend entirely
on the specific elements (states, groups, organizations, individuals) in
a crisis. Political dangers are 'mastered by the **multiplication** of
directing axioms']{.underline} (Deleuze and Guattari 1986, 462). [The
contingency of luxurious war shapes the axioms of]{.underline} the
**[R]{.underline}**esponsibility **[t]{.underline}**o
**[P]{.underline}**rotect [insofar as they adapt to the **exigencies**
of an emergent situation]{.underline}. The [invocation]{.underline} of
the Responsibility to Protect [in **Libya**]{.underline}, for example,
[appears in connection with other axioms in global politics]{.underline}
(concerning **[oil]{.underline}**, **[the war on
terror]{.underline}**ism, etc.) [that differentiate it from the
application]{.underline} of the Responsibility to Protect [in **Syria**
despite widespread human misery in both contexts. Another axiomatic
dimension]{.underline} of the Responsibility to Protect [concerns the
definition of sovereignty **itself**.]{.underline} The ICISS (2001, 12)
report [defines sovereignty as 'the **legal identity** of a state in
international law]{.underline}.' However, the
**[R]{.underline}**esponsibility **[t]{.underline}**o
**[P]{.underline}**rotect [supplements this definition by arguing that
any signatory to the UN Charter 'accepts the responsibilities of
membership flowing from that signature']{.underline} (ICISS 2001, 13).
[Signing the Charter commits the state to a new set of
**obligations**.]{.underline} As the report puts it: '[There is no
transfer or dilution of state sovereignty. But there is a necessary
**re-characterization** involved: from sovereignty as control to
sovereignty as responsibility in both internal functions and external
duties']{.underline} (ICISS 2001, 13). The [dual character
of]{.underline} this [obligation is important for understanding the
relationship between the responsibility to **protect** and
**sovereignty**]{.underline}. First, the Responsibility to Protect
[implies that a state has a primary 'internal' obligation to protect and
enhance the safety and livelihood of its citizenry]{.underline} (ICISS
2001, 23--24). Second, [sufficient protection of citizenry requires that
state authorities subject themselves to international scrutiny and,
moreover, that each signatory agrees to scrutinize other
states]{.underline}. [By recoding sovereignty in terms of
responsibility, the report establishes a series of new linkages between
the state, the **U**nited **N**ations as a representative of the
international community, and inchoate dangers to human
security.]{.underline} [These linkages treat the state as an exclusive
template for rendering **political identity intelligible**]{.underline}
(de Larrinaga and Doucet 2008). Furthermore, [this framework enables
**punitive** and **corrective** measures to be deployed against
**non-liberal** state.]{.underline} However, while the Responsibility to
Protect goes on at length about the obligations the state adopts by
signing the UN Charter, the report does not clarify how the UN should
successfully exercise its authority and obligate states to intervene
(ICISS 2001, 47--50). This adds two elements to the picture. First, any
state signing the UN charter not only agrees to abide by the norms of
the Responsibility to Protect with regards to its own citizenry, but
also implicitly agrees to assist in promoting these standards globally.
In effect, the **[R]{.underline}**esponsibility **[t]{.underline}**o
**[P]{.underline}**rotect [creates a **global redundancy**, binding both
a particular state and the community of states to the principles of
human security.]{.underline} [The amorphous character of]{.underline}
the UN [authority suggests that the propagation of the norms of human
security and the liberal state is the primary effect of]{.underline} the
**[R]{.underline}**esponsibility **[t]{.underline}**o
**[P]{.underline}**rotect. At the same time, this [norm contains
structural indeterminacies concerning -- when states are supposed to
intervene, what obligations to preserve human security entail, and what
constitutes a **sufficiently** liberal state.]{.underline} In this
respect, [indeterminacy requires the construction of **additional**
axioms]{.underline}. Second, the Responsibility to Protect indicates
that only states that already adequately protect their citizens may
engage in humanitarian action. This [criterion maintains that only those
states with **excesses** of **wealth**, **military force**, or
**resources** may engage in humanitarian activity without placing their
own population in jeopardy.]{.underline} In this way, the Responsibility
to Protect links the capacity for humanitarian intervention to the
existence of excess military and economic resources. [Humanitarian
action thus becomes an expressive byproduct of excess military
force.]{.underline} In this light, [it is no surprise that 'abuses'
of]{.underline} the [indeterminacy]{.underline} of the Responsibility to
Protect [occur]{.underline} (Bellamy 2010) [because the conditions of
luxurious war subtend the axiom in the report that dictates which states
have the authority and the capacity to intervene.]{.underline} In short,
the **[R]{.underline}**esponsibility **[t]{.underline}**o
**[P]{.underline}**rotect [augments the value of accumulating military
force by linking this to the exercise of **global
governance**]{.underline}. Several additional axiomatic features stand
out with respect to the redefinition of sovereignty. First, the
**[R]{.underline}**esponsibility **[t]{.underline}**o
**[P]{.underline}**rotect [turns all states into **isomorphic** models
of realization for the basic objective of maintaining **human welfare**,
**economic circulation**, and **security**.]{.underline} [Despite
heterogeneous cultures, social structures, and governmental
organizations the basic function of the state must conform to the
minimal standards of facilitating the health and well-being of the
populace]{.underline}. Since this isomorphic character extends to all
states, the application of the Responsibility to Protect licenses
humanitarian and military efforts ignoring existing antagonism or
conflicts between states. [The isomorphic status of the state serves to
'**smooth'** global space into a single operational terrain, with
individual states functioning as **service centers** for the
administration of human welfare. This reconstitution of global space
turns states into components of 'a **war machine** of which they
themselves were only the parts']{.underline} (Deleuze and Guattari 1986,
469).16 [Political sovereignty]{.underline}, in this regard, [is a
secondary feature produced by the connection to large **flexible**,
**heterogeneous**, and **riskless** militaries that may rapidly and
precisely operate in any area of the globe]{.underline}.17 In this
respect, advocates of the Responsibility to Protect who object to the
traditional framework of sovereignty (Evans 2008) end up endorsing
axioms of the Responsibility to protect, which simply augment the
capacity of powerful states to make provisional decisions about whether
or not to intervene in political conflicts. The repositioning of
luxurious war at the center of humanitarianism is also reflected in the
ICISS report's description of military action. The report requires that
military action occur only in 'extreme and exceptional cases,' where the
principle of non-intervention guides the process of military
mobilization (ICISS 2001). To this end, [the responsibility stipulates
that military action must satisfy six principles: **right authority**,
**just cause**, **right intention**, **last resort**, **proportional
means**, and **reasonable prospects**]{.underline} (ICISS 2001).18
Together, these principles enable military intervention by legally
legitimate coalitions in situations of extreme human insecurity with
appropriate uses of force. The Responsibility to Protect also provides
substantial detail on the procedures for military intervention. The
report begins by acknowledging that humanitarian military action has
'different objectives from both traditional war-fighting and traditional
peacekeeping' (ICISS 2001, 57). According to the report, only after the
failure of preventative deployments does a military force get 'turned
into an intervention tool' (ICISS 2001, 58). Put differently, it is only
after a series of minor expenditures take place that war emerges as a
viable mode of expenditure and military intervention becomes a
possibility. Furthermore, once military engagement begins, the
Responsibility to Protect clarifies that all interventions should be
directed by coalition forces with a 'common political resolve,' which
harmonizes their humanitarian agendas (ICISS 2001, 58). Any effort
requires 'a clear and unambiguous mandate' to ensure sufficient force
commitment from participating states (ICISS 2001, 60). However, this
mandate must 'allow the executing military commander to identify his
mission and his tasks properly and to propose an operational concept
which promises quick success' and this also prompts an enormous
commitment of resources as a 'clear signal of resolve and intent' (ICISS
2001, 61). The document clarifies the essential role of political
oversight in any military operation so as to ensure stringent
observation of the principles of proportionality and protection of human
life. Nonetheless, the report notes the desirability of a 'quick success
in military operations \[...\] achieved by surprise, overwhelming force
and through concentration of all military efforts' and, where this is
impossible, by keeping missions 'especially focused' with 'key military
and political pressure points identified and targeted' (ICISS 2001,
62--63). The report also clarifies that 'force protection of the
intervention force is important, but should never be allowed to become
the principal objective' (ICISS 2001, 63). A proper intervention
therefore requires preventative efforts and the use of coalition forces
with broad political oversight. Intervention is nonetheless directed by
military commanders with wide discretion to identify operational
objectives, in hopefully quick efforts, characterized by significant
planning and the deployment of overwhelming concentrations of force that
nonetheless target a limited series of key points, with only secondary
regard to force protection. Numerous tensions are evident at this point.
First, a tactical tension: the Responsibility to Protect wrestles with
conflicting objectives in the domain of targeting. On the one hand, the
report counsels strict political oversight of a military operation that
targets a limited set of crucial military and political points. On the
other, the report defers significantly to the imperatives of a military
commander tasked, clearly and swiftly demonstrating the political
resolve of coalition forces. As a result, [the military action called
for by the document]{.underline}, while theoretically constrained by
proportional use and the need for human security, [is sufficiently
indeterminate to enable a broad spectrum of **war-fighting** actions
depending on the **principles**, **aims**, and **needs** of a military
commander]{.underline}. In essence, the report's protocols are
constructed around the possibility of an oscillation or surge in
military force, which also compromises the delicate use of military
force advocated by the rest of the report. Second, the report is struck
by conflicting desires concerning the form of military engagement. In
one case, the report counsels an extreme buildup, concentration, and use
of force in order to demonstrate resolve and right intention, and to
quickly defeat enemy forces. At the same time, the report stipulates
that any use of military force should remain at a minimum level required
by a particular conflict. Once again, the report establishes conflicting
imperatives for organizing military forces. The drive towards military
expenditure, which the report concedes is occasionally necessary, rests
upon a group of explicit restraints. However, this also conflicts with a
desire for decisive, resolved, and swift military action. The report is
caught between a desire for an extreme deployment of excessive force in
order to defeat or terrify enemy forces and the need to respect a
state\'s imperatives and observe the principle of proportionality. This
inconsistency is built into the structure of the report and facilitates
the use of military expenditure in some contexts and inaction in others
(Dunne and Gifkins 2011). Third, the report does not explain where or
how states will procure their intervention forces, but presupposes the
existence of a highly mobile, concentrated, efficient fighting force
capable of adeptly targeting conflict sites anywhere on the globe. Put
simply, the Responsibility to Protect's assumption about the existence
of military force merely reflects the existing arrangement of global
war-fighting capacity. The global permeation of Western military power
becomes a crucial principle of the Responsibility to Protect and, thus,
the guidelines for military action rest firmly in the constraints of
existing military force. Moreover, this presupposition also suggests
that the Responsibility to Protect only seeks to modulate the aim or
role of these military forces or, put differently, it simply modifies
the mode of military expenditure while leaving the broader dynamics of
luxurious war intact. Coupled with the report's redefinition of
sovereignty, the Responsibility to Protect, authorizes the conditions of
luxurious war by appealing to the 'force' of existing military
arrangements to underwrite the protection of human security.

[The Object as **NOTHING** The subject is concerned with
knowledge]{.underline}, and [knowledge requires that the subject
maintain its integrity amidst the ravishing **movement of
time**]{.underline}. The [barriers that the subject erects to this end
come in the form of taboos that preserve the discontinuity between
**subject** and **object**]{.underline}. In contrast, passivity is
dynamic in that the subject who renounces the project of knowledge moves
outside of him or herself into the tumultuous world of continuity. The
etymological root of \"passion\" just adds further credibility to the
attribution of passivity to the subject\'s disintegration. Nevertheless,
ev[en a disintegrated subject is not altogether **independent** of
objectivity.]{.underline} This is because [unknowing is a matter not of
renunciation]{.underline} (which would still involve the active will)
[but of **dis-solution**]{.underline}. [The impossible
object]{.underline}, then, [cannot represent a mere absence]{.underline}
(as is often the case in negative theology) [but must participate in the
play of **presence** and **absence**. In contrast to the serious project
of reason, which is a matter of **accumulation**, communicative
experience is a matter of **dissipation**]{.underline}. [Like the heat
that often signifies passion, communication is fundamentally a **process
of loss.**]{.underline} [Bataille embraces this loss in a drunken
revelry that, far from **selfindulgent**, is literally a
**self-sacrifice**]{.underline}. [The subject
**sacrifices**]{.underline} ~~him or~~ [herself \[themselves\] to the
movement of continuity. This happens when an object that is
simultaneously **absent** and **present** confronts the
subject]{.underline}. Because the subject\'s anticipation dissolves into
NOTHING when confronted by such an object, ~~his or her~~ \[their\]
self-importance becomes suddenly ridiculous. [In the ensuing
**laughter** or **tears**, the subject is restored to the world of
continuity.]{.underline} [Sacred, poetic, and erotic objects all act in
the same manner: the subject anticipates a presence that miraculously
dissolves into an absence.]{.underline} [But how should one characterize
this absence?]{.underline} Bataille writes: \"[this NOTHING has little
to do with nothingness. Nothingness is a metaphysical concept. The
NOTHING I speak of is a datum of experience, and is considered here only
insofar as experience implies it.]{.underline}\"\'\"
[Bataille]{.underline} is careful to avoid the abstractions that
characterize metaphysical thought. Above all, he [wants to remain
faithful to **experience**]{.underline}. And Bataille [insists that
experience testifies to both **presence** and **absence**.]{.underline}
Strictly speaking, [the only experience of NOTHING that we can
have]{.underline} - and even this experience is only possible
vicariously - [is that of **death**.]{.underline} [If the desire for
NOTHING is the positive anticipation of death]{.underline} (at this
juncture, one cannot help but to hear echoes of Heidegger\'s Sein zum
Tode), [it becomes susceptible to a kind of metaphysical
**reification**]{.underline}. But, on the other hand, [it is difficult
to see how we could desire NOTHING if death was merely a **negative
phenomenon**.]{.underline} Ultimately, [Bataille resolves this
difficulty by invoking the play of **presence** and **absence** that
dissolves beings in the luxury of **communication**. Just as the impact
of poetry stems as much from the empty spaces as from the signs
themselves, the positive miracle - though associated with presence -
derives its force from absence.]{.underline} The absence in question is
of an anticipated reality, a reality shattered by the emergence of an
unexpected presence. [Such is the case when a loved one thought dead
miraculously appears, resulting in the happy tears that Bataille finds
fascinating.]{.underline} Similarly, [the negative miracle of death
cannot be an object of experience unless it is
**represented**]{.underline}. [Death marks the end of experience, so one
can only experience death through various ruses of **vicarious
substitution**.]{.underline} [Whether the miracle is positive or
negative, what matters is the **juxtaposition** of **reality** and
**impossibility**]{.underline}. [The reality of an
impossibility]{.underline} - whether it is death or the winning lottery
ticket - [leads to our dissolution in **tears**]{.underline}. But te[ars
are but one way that we can respond to an impossible
reality]{.underline}. **[Laughter]{.underline}**,
**[ecstasy]{.underline}**, **[poetry]{.underline}** - in fact, all of
Bataille\'s [privileged forms of communication come about as a result of
the exposure to an impossible reality.]{.underline} As real, however,
[the impossible must be represented as an object - even if the object is
a mere vanishing point in the dissolution of subjectivity.]{.underline}
The object might be an object of knowledge, but only up to the point
that it vanishes and provokes the moment of effusion. [In our subjective
experience of the object in the field of **positive** and **practical**
knowledge, anticipation dissolves into NOTHING at the moment when the
possibility of the object is snatched away from us]{.underline}. [This
is the point of coincidence between **knowing** and
**unknowing**.]{.underline} [What results from this collision between
**reality** and **impossibility** is the objectless depths of **inner
experience**. Although inner experience is **objectless**, it is not
equivalent to a **pure subjectivity**.]{.underline} [This is because it
is **subjectless** as well.]{.underline} [Unfettered by the
subject-object relation that determines knowledge, it would seem that
inner experience should be immediate]{.underline}. [But immediacy by
itself is **not communication**]{.underline}. Communication takes place
when the immediate collides with the mediated, when experience collides
with the consciousness of experience. Again, [Bataille locates value in
the process of **un-knowing**]{.underline}. [Value resides not in
nothingness as such but in the movement of the subject towards
**NOTHING**.]{.underline} [This movement takes the form of a
**surrender**, a complete renunciation of effort.]{.underline} [But to
what is one surrendering?]{.underline} Essentially, one is surrendering
to **[NOTHING]{.underline}**. But because [NOTHING exceeds the frontiers
of representation, our only indication of surrender]{.underline} -
[after the withdrawal of the object - is a vague feeling of
**suffering**,]{.underline} a feeling of being unexpectedly penetrated
from outside. Putting aside the sexual undertones of being penetrated
for the moment, Bataille\' s [belief that unfulfilled expectation opens
the space in which NOTHING echoes]{.underline} the sentiments of Proust.
And [for]{.underline} both [Bataille]{.underline} and Proust, [the
**ensuing annihilation** is inextricably tied to time]{.underline}. It
is only that [Bataille projects expectation into the
future]{.underline}, while Proust explores expectation in terms of the
voluntary past. Notwithstanding this difference, both
[Bataille]{.underline} and Proust re[cognize the significance of time in
relation to the collision between **experience** and the
**consciousness** of experience]{.underline}. Bataille pays subtle
homage to Proust when he writes: \"In place of transcendence - and in
the utterly deranged and completely empty abyss - ecstasy discloses the
identity of reality and ecstasy, identifying the absurd object with the
absurd subject and the time-object that destroys by being destroyed with
the subject that is destroyed.\"\'\' [The mutual **laceration**
initiated by the \"timeobject\" cuts across the divisions normally made
between various types of **ecstasy**.]{.underline} In mystical bliss and
in sexual rapture, in the felicity brought about by involuntary memory
and in the anxiety attached to games of chance, it is always a matter of
the object of desire inexorably leading the subject to annihilation.
[The link between **time** and **annihilation** culminates in
death]{.underline}. For Bataille, [death introduces a break where an
isolated being loses]{.underline} him or herself [\[themself\] in \"a
reality that transcends the common limitations]{.underline}. [So
**unlimited** is it that it is not even a thing: it is
**nothing**]{.underline}.\"\' 2 [Death lacerates specific existence,
inaugurating a reality that cannot be reduced to the reflection of
things. To embrace death is to desire the **impossible**]{.underline}.
And [what else is sovereignty but the renunciation of the possibilities
that constitute **servile existence?**]{.underline} [Time passes,
**ravishing** everything that we devote our lives to
constructing.]{.underline} [The havoc wrought by time extends beyond the
products of our labor to our very **identities**]{.underline}. The
[chronic annihilation effected by the passage of time will ultimately be
total, for at the end of time awaits **death**.]{.underline}
[Death]{.underline} definitively [shatters the illusion of discontinuous
existence]{.underline}, [an illusion meticulously fabricated from **past
experiences** and **future projects**.]{.underline} All of these
experiences and projects will be as nothing. But for Bataille, this is
not a reason for melancholy lamentation. [The Sisyphean task of our
lives is nothing else than an instantiation of the Kantian definition of
the **sublime**: purposiveness without purpose is the very definition of
**human existence**.]{.underline} [Time consumes the substance of our
lives, emitting the **incandescent nothingness** that is our
truth.]{.underline} [It is of little consequence whether this
nothingness is described as our **individual insignificance** in
relation to the totality]{.underline} (as it is in Buddhist thought),
[as the **sudden disruption** of the identity constructed by voluntary
memory]{.underline} (as it is in Proust), [as the empty space left by
the **death of God**]{.underline}, [as the decomposition of the flesh in
**death**]{.underline} and in sex, [or as the vertiginous abyss opened
by the holocaust of words.]{.underline} [What matters is that,
confronted by the truth of nothingness, the individual moves outside the
limits imposed by **reason** and **communicates**.]{.underline}

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (**[NATO]{.underline}**), [since
the]{.underline} implosion of the former Soviet Union (1991) and the
[disappearance of its supposed mortal enemy, on whom it constructed its
own military, geopolitical and warring space,]{.underline} has been
re-fabricating its own identity and functions. And [has struggled to
retain its status quo ante power position]{.underline} inside a changing
global security environment [in taking an active part in]{.underline}
various conflicts (**[security operations]{.underline}**) [around the
world]{.underline}. In this transformative exercise [the Alliance
has]{.underline} modified its security language and narrative employing
a Critical Security Studies language, and in this process has [adapted
its language,]{.underline} its [security dilemma,]{.underline} and its
[securitization process to its own]{.underline} **[subjective
reading]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline} [**'out there
security/insecurity reality'** in order to reproduce itself as a human
structure.]{.underline}

In this workout [the Alliance operates as a]{.underline}
**[power-knowledge-security-total institution]{.underline}**
[structure]{.underline} which is [interested to produce and sell to its
own]{.underline} **[NATO audience]{.underline}** [an
insecurity-security]{.underline} **[self-referential
narrative]{.underline}** [which permits to make itself indispensable for
the maintenance of security in NATO's territories]{.underline}. This
means that [as a power-knowledge-security-total institution
structure]{.underline} (1) it has legitimate power to get X to do
something that X would not otherwise do, and [has power to prevent
people]{.underline}, to whatever degree, [from having grievances
by]{.underline} **[shaping]{.underline}** their
**[perceptions]{.underline}**, cognitions and preferences [in such a way
that they]{.underline} **[accept their role]{.underline}** [in the
existing order]{.underline} of things (Lukes 2005: 11; as it will be
developed in this paper this idea of power overlaps with the concepts of
bourgeois ideology of Barthes, of ideology of Zizek, of the distribution
of the sensible of Ranciere, and the idea of identity formation and
cultural system); (2) [it produces through the use of a]{.underline}
**[technocratic apparatus]{.underline}** (Galimberti 2011) [a
security-insecurity knowledge, and defines and certifies as reliable
knowledgei what insecurity is (the]{.underline} [**existential
threat**), and the protocol which must be adopted for the security
operation]{.underline}; (3) it has recognized legitimate power and the
monopoly of the use of force, therefore it can take and carry security
actions (war, crisis management operations, etc); and (4) [as a total
institution]{.underline} (Goffman 2010) [it administers the life of the
people who lives in its structure, and impose an]{.underline}
'**[habitus']{.underline}** (Bourdieu 2005) [to its
members]{.underline}, and the same members identify themselves with the
same structure. Meaning that their **[identity is shaped by the very
total institution]{.underline}**, like the case of this paper [in which
NATO moulds, influences and affects the construction and the
perpetuation of NATO-ness]{.underline}. As a result [the]{.underline}
**[NATOcitizen]{.underline}** [translate the 'out there
security/insecurity reality' as NATO does therefore confirm the point
that NATO is]{.underline} again **[a cultural system]{.underline}**
(Geertz 1973).

The above introduction [opens ontological and epistemological questions
regarding what insecurity and security is]{.underline}. This is because
NATO[, along its narrating activity, do not provide]{.underline} a
straight [an]{.underline}d [objective definition of what security
is]{.underline}, and [we have to assume]{.underline} that **[security
means 'NATO']{.underline}**, or living under or with NATO protection,
whilst for insecurity the Alliance narrative moves from the extreme of
an 'armed attack against one or more of them (the parties) in Europe or
North America shall be considered an attack against them all' (Art. 5,
The North Atlantic Treaty, Washington D.C. 4th April 1949) to 'the risk
of...' which appears on the 2010 NATO Strategic Concept.

However, there is a specific important aspect which passes through the
[image of an armed attack]{.underline} [and]{.underline} 'the
[risk]{.underline} of...', and [it is represented by the]{.underline}
**[constant element of 'anxiety']{.underline}** which (1) is present in
the etymological meaning of 'security' too; and (2) do play a pivotal
point around [which]{.underline} turns this paper that want to
[demonstrate that security is a myth which sustains a **cultural
system** in which the spectacle of the myth (US Army and NATO
operation]{.underline} 'Dragoon Ride'[) has an important
function]{.underline}.

II\. SECURITY AS A MYTH

Analysing the evolution of the NATO's New Strategic Concepts (1999 and
20100) from the implosion of the former Soviet Union up to the recent
2010 text, what emerges is that the Alliance has been reformulating its
security dilemma in order to prevent a security paradox, meaning that
the security response to an insecurity event is not adequate at all.

A security dilemma refers to a situation wherein two or more states are
drawn into conflict, possibly even war, over security concerns, even
though none of the states actually desire conflict. Essentially, the
security dilemma occurs when two or more states each feel insecure in
relation to other states. For Booth and Wheeler [the security dilemma is
a complex relationship of both]{.underline}
**[psychological]{.underline}** [and material dimensions]{.underline},
and 'is a two-level predicament in relations between states and other
actors, with each level consisting of two related lemmas (or
propositions that can be assumed to be valid) which force decision
makers to choose between them. The first and basic level consists of a
dilemma of interpretation about the motives, intentions and capabilities
of the others; the second and derivative level consists of a dilemma of
response about the most rational way of responding. First level: a
dilemma of interpretation is the predicament facing decisionmakers when
they are confronted, on matters affecting security, with a choice
between two significant and usually (but not always) undesirable
alternatives about the military policies and political postures of other
entities. This dilemma of interpretation is the result of the perceived
need to make a decision in the existential condition of unresolvable
uncertainty about the motives, intentions and capabilities of the
others. Those responsible have to decide whether perceived military
developments are for defensive or self-protection purposes only (to
enhance security in an uncertain world) or whether they are for
offensive purposes (to seek to change the status quo to their
advantage). Second level: a dilemma of response logically begins when
the dilemma of interpretation has been settled. Decision-makers then
need to determine how to react. Should they signal, by words and deeds,
that they will react in kind, for deterrent purposes? Or should they
seek to signal reassurance? If the dilemma of response is based on
misplaced suspicion regarding the motives and intentions of others
actors, and decision-makers react in a militarily confrontational
manner, then they risk creating a significant level of mutual hostility
when none was originally intended by either party; if the response is
based on misplaced trust, there is a risk they will be exposed to
coercion by those with hostile intentions. [When leaders resolve their
dilemma of response in a manner that creates a spiral of mutual
hostility,]{.underline} when neither wanted it, [a situation has
developed which we call the security paradox']{.underline} (Booth and
Wheeler 2008: 4-5).

Therefore, what do play an important role in the definition of what
**[security]{.underline}** is (because this is the function of the
security dilemma) [depends on psychological and material dimensions, on
interpretation, and on power]{.underline}. [Thus, the subjective
approach to security is confirmed.]{.underline}

In addition, the Alliance has not yet defined the meaning of security
but has always presented its own meanings of security (the NATO's
strategic concepts) and has produced its own system of communication.
And this contrast with the fact that [the very referent of the term
'security']{.underline} [(freedom from danger, fear, anxiety,
destitution]{.underline}, and so on[)]{.underline}, [is represented only
by its etymological meaning which **bears strong
emotions**]{.underline}. 'Security' is derived from the Latin
'securitas' and in its turn from 'sine' (= without) + 'cura' (= anxiety,
worry). Therefore, the above reasoning demonstrates that [the relation
between a power-knowledge structure like NATO, a term (security), its
meaning and its usage is the same relation which exists in the concept
of **myth**]{.underline} developed by Roland Barthes (2000) for whom the
myth is [a system of communication defined as a]{.underline} **['second
order semiological system']{.underline}**.

For Barthes, the 'first order semiological system' is formed by the
'1.Signifier' (acoustic image), '2.Signified' (concept) and '3.Sign'
(relation between concept and image). This first order represents a
linguistic system in which, once applied to the term 'security', it
produces that: (1) '1.Signifier' is the written word 'security';
'2.Signified' is represented by the etymological meaning of security:
'securitas' (without anxiety); (3) '3. Sign' is what I call
'security-securitas', which represent the 'referent' in this paper.

However, [the myth is a peculiar system because it is a constructed from
a semiological chain which existed before it: it is a second order
semiological system]{.underline}. That which is **[a sign]{.underline}**
(the associative total of a concept and an image) in the first system,
**[becomes a mere signifier in the second]{.underline}**. [The material
of]{.underline} **[mythical speech]{.underline}**, however different at
the start, [are reduced to a pure signifying function as soon as they
are caught by myth. Whatever it deals only with alphabetical or
pictorial writing, myth wants to see in them only a sum of signs, a
global sign, the final term of a first semiological chain]{.underline}.
And it is precisely this final term which will become the first term of
a greater system This lateral shift is essential for the analysis of
mith. In myth there are two semiological systems, one of which is
staggered in relation to the other: a linguistic system, the language,
which Barthes calls language-object, because it is the language which
myth gets hold of in order to build its own system; and [myth
itself,]{.underline} which Barthes calls
**['metalanguage']{.underline}**, because it [is a second language in
which one speaks about the first]{.underline}. When he reflects on a
metalanguage, the semiologist no longer needs to ask himself questions
about the composition of the language-object, he no longer has to take
into account the details of the linguistic schema; he will only need to
know its total term, or global sign, and only as this term lends itself
to mith. This is why the semiologist is entitled to treat in the same
way writing and pictures: what he retains from them is the fact that
they are both signs and they constitute a language-object.

Therefore the 'second order semiological system' of the myth of security
is made up of: 'I SIGNIFIER' is provided by '3.Sign'
(security-securitas)'; 'II SIGNIFIED' is [the result of the political,
intellectual, elaboration of 'security-securitas' by an]{.underline}
**[epistemological community]{.underline}** ([in the case]{.underline}
of his paper this is represented by [the Alliance technocratic
apparatus]{.underline}), [which]{.underline} **[transforms and recreates
the meaning]{.underline}** [and practices of what
constitute]{.underline} **[anxiety-existential threat]{.underline}**;
'III SIGN is the characteristic and peculiar image/picture that the sign
will assume which changes in time and space.

As a result, while in the linguistic system the word 'security' has only
one referent represented by its etymological meaning 'securitas, [in the
metalanguage system the term 'security' is the result of a]{.underline}
**[linguistic-narrative fabrication]{.underline}**, **[operated by a
power-knowledge structure]{.underline}**, and therefore change with time
and space.

In this specific context the step from the first to the second
semiological order, then [the]{.underline} **[very fabrication of the
myth security]{.underline}**, [is possible through]{.underline} a
technique defined as [securitization process which allow the
powerknowledge-security-total institution structure]{.underline} (1) [to
define a human even as an]{.underline} **[existential
threat]{.underline}** to the survival of the community it protects; (2)
to add the element of 'emergency' which blocks any external (of the
structure) tentative to criticize the move; and (3) [to present the myth
security as 'reliable knowledge', therefore, 'legitimate security
knowledge']{.underline}ii [when in reality is only an]{.underline}
'**[image of knowledge']{.underline}**iii.

For Buzan, Waever, and de Wilde [security 'is the move that takes
politics beyond the conventional rules of the game and frames the issue
either as a special kind of politics or as above politics]{.underline}.
Securitization can thus be seen as a more extreme version of
politicization. In theory, any public issue can be located on the
spectrum ranging from non-politicized (meaning the state does not deal
with it and it is not in any other way made an issue of public debate
and decision) through politicized (meaning the issue is part of public
policy, requiring government decision and resource allocations or, more
rarely, some other form of communal governance) to securitized (meaning
the issue is presented as an existential threat, requiring emergency
measures and justifying action outside the normal bounds of political
procedure)' (Buzan, Waever, and de Wilde 1998: 23-24). In this way, [the
process of **securitization is more than a speech act**]{.underline}
(Buzan, Waever, and de Wilde 1998: 24-26; Balzacq 2011) [through which
an issue is presented as an existential threat, requiring emergency
measures, and justifying actions outside the bounds of the political
procedure]{.underline} (Buzan, Waever, and de Wilde 1998: 23-24). [It is
rather]{.underline} '[an articulated assemblage of practices
whereby]{.underline} **[heuristic artefacts]{.underline}** (metaphors,
policy tools, image repertoires, analogies, stereotypes, emotions, etc.)
[are contextually mobilized by a securitizing actor, who works to prompt
an audience to build a coherent network of implications]{.underline}
(feelings, sensations, thought, and intuitions) [about]{.underline} the
[critical vulnerability of a referent object]{.underline} that concurs
with the securitizing actor's reasons for choices and actions,
[by]{.underline} **[investing the referent object with such an aura of
unprecedented threatening complexion]{.underline}** [that a customized
policy must be undertaken immediately to block its
development]{.underline}' (Balzacq 2011: 3).

However, [once the security myth is created by]{.underline} the security
actor ([NATO]{.underline}) [it needs a ritual, a]{.underline}
**[spectacle]{.underline}** [in order 'to prompt an audience to build a
coherent network of implications]{.underline} (feelings, sensations,
thought, and intuitions)[']{.underline}. And paraphrasing Huysmans
(2006) who see in the process of securitization a technique of governing
danger, I see in the '[articulated assemblage of practices whereby
heuristic artefacts]{.underline} (**[metaphors]{.underline}**, **[policy
tools]{.underline}**, **[image repertoires]{.underline}**,
**[analogies]{.underline}**, **[stereotypes]{.underline}**,
**[emotions]{.underline}**, etc.)' [are condensed in the
ritual-spectacle of the myth security, a technique of]{.underline}
**[governing the myth]{.underline}**. And this technique of governing
the myth has to be [understood inside]{.underline} the framework
provided by the concept of [the sacralization of politics,
which]{.underline}, according to Gentile (2007), [consists of bestowing
a]{.underline} **[sacred character]{.underline}** [to a]{.underline}
**[secular entity]{.underline}**, [as the nation,]{.underline} the
[state,]{.underline} the [race,]{.underline} the [political party
and]{.underline} the [leader]{.underline}. In these situations,
[politics become a religion because, through a complex of beliefs,
expressed by the use of myths, rituals, and symbols, it pretends to
define the meaning and the final end of the individual and the
collective existence]{.underline} (Gentile 2007: vii).

However, [one]{.underline} of the [military implication]{.underline}
that [NATO]{.underline}'s [has to overcome]{.underline} in this update
[is to win]{.underline} **[the battle of narrative]{.underline}**
(Soligan 2009), meaning that the Alliance has to concentrate in its
spectacle-ritual performance to convince its audience of its utility and
indispensability for their security in a new environment in which the
NATO's security myth is represented by 'the risk of...'.

Therefore, in this new securitization process in which any 'risk of...'
insecurity threat is identified, [the]{.underline} **[ritual and
spectacles]{.underline}** [attached to the Alliance's **security
myth**]{.underline} do [play the important role to explain what security
means.]{.underline} Thus, [the approach **we have to** take,
must]{.underline} be dynamic, and we have to '**[consume the
myth]{.underline}** [according to the very ends built into its
structure:]{.underline} **[the reader lives the myth as a story at once
true and real]{.underline}**' (Barthes 2000: 128). [Only in this way we
can understand that the power-knowledge-security-total institution
structure aims to]{.underline} **[discipline our sensible
order]{.underline}** [practising the 'distribution of the sensible'
which]{.underline}, according to Ranciere, [is the law governing the
sensible order that parcels out places and forms of participation in a
common world by first establishing the modes of perception within which
these are inscribed]{.underline}. It [produces]{.underline} a [system of
self-evident facts of perception]{.underline} [based on a set horizons
and modalities of what is visible and audible as well as what can be
said, thought, made, or done]{.underline}. The 'distribution' refers
both to forms of inclusion and to form of exclusion. The 'sensible'
refers to what is 'aistheton' (sensible) or capable of being apprehended
by the senses (Ranciere 2014: 89).

In conclusion, it emerges that [the power of the myth is to shape
perceptions, cognitions, and preferences of people in such a way that
they **accept their role in the existing order of things**]{.underline}
(Lukes 2005: 11), [and to]{.underline} **[make believe]{.underline}**
(Walton 1990). And [the myth of security]{.underline} [(the process of
securitization)]{.underline} [is converted into]{.underline} (1)
[a]{.underline} **[cultural system]{.underline}**, where culture
'denotes [a]{.underline}n historically transmitted [patter of meanings
embodied in symbols, a system of inherited conceptions expressed in
symbolic forms]{.underline} by means of which men communicate,
perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and attitudes toward life'
(Geertz 1973: 89), whilst a cultural system is composed of 'culture
patterns -- religious, philosophical, aesthetic, scientific, ideological
-- are "programs"; they provide a template or blueprint for the
organization of social and psychological processes, much as genetic
system provide such a template for the organization of organic
processes' (Geertz 1973: 216); (2) a technique of governmentality,
defined by Huysmans as technique of governing danger where 'technique
refers simultaneously to (i) a particular method of doing an activity
which usually involves practical skills that are developed through
training and practice, (ii) a mode of procedure in an activity, and
(iii) the disposition of things according to a regular plan or design
(...). It is [embedded in training, routine, and technical knowledge and
skills, as well as technological artefacts]{.underline}' (Huysmans 2006:
9); [and]{.underline} (3) [an]{.underline} **[ideology]{.underline}**
the function of which 'is **[not to offer us a point of escape from our
reality but to offer us the social reality itself as an escape from some
traumatic, real kernel]{.underline}**' (Zizek 2008: 45).

At the end, as Barthes argues, [it is the myth]{.underline} (which is
[produced through the securitization process]{.underline}) [which
becomes a]{.underline} **[bourgeois ideology]{.underline}**. 'As the
bourgeois ideology is defined by the abandonment of the same
"bourgeois", [myth is constituted by the loss of the historical quality
of things: in it, things lose the memory that they once were
made]{.underline}' (Barthes 2000: 142). And [the myth-bourgeois
ideology]{.underline} **[represented by NATO's security]{.underline}**
[achieves the particular ideology effect of]{.underline} **[persuading
us that a certain order of the world]{.underline}**, a certain way of
doing things, **[is given by nature]{.underline}**, [rather than the
result of human action on the world that could have been
otherwise]{.underline}. Thus, paraphrasing Barthes (2000: 143): in
passing from history to nature, [NATO-security myth]{.underline} acts
economically: it **[abolishes the complexity]{.underline}** [of human
acts, it gives them the simplicity of essence]{.underline} s, [it does
away with all dialects, with any going back beyond what is immediately
visible, it organizes a world which is without contradictions because it
is without depth, a world wide open and wallowing in the evident, it
establishes a blissful clarity: things appear to mean something by
themselves]{.underline}, like the image of the 'Dragoon Ride' operation

Bataille contrasts [community as a structure which aims at **securing
its permanence**, denying or disavowing death]{.underline}, with
community in a more vital sense meaning a coming together of human
beings in an immediate awareness of mortality and of their radical
'insufficiency'. It seems that [any established community -- before it
grows into an entity that could be called a culture, society or nation
-- is founded in death]{.underline}, in a painful awareness of
mortality. Yet, gradually, [through]{.underline} the erection of
monuments and other [barricades against time]{.underline}, as well as
against the surrounding spaces, a '[community' comes to imagine itself
as necessary and permanent]{.underline}. Such a community becomes
hierarchical; it is ruled by a head. Just as all of its members are
ruled, **[they must also rule themselves]{.underline}**, must learn to
negate their passions and use their head. All community is rooted in
death -- always touches death -- but as communities become monocephalic,
their [relationship to death becomes one of negation rather than
affirmation.]{.underline} Egyptian society under the pharaohs or
god-kings is the archetype of this process. Of the great pyramids dotted
along the Nile, Bataille writes, 'no enterprise cost a greater amount of
labour than this one, which wanted to halt the flow of time . . . they
transcend the intolerable void that time opens under men's feet, for all
possible movement is halted in their geometric surfaces. IT SEEMS THAT
THEY MAINTAIN WHAT ESCAPES FROM THE DYING MAN' (Bataille, 1985, p. 216,
emphasis in original). Only as [community organises itself
through]{.underline} a head, through [authority]{.underline} and through
military sovereignty and repression, does **[it become de-vitalised and
stagnant]{.underline}**: its repressive measures extend, becoming
increasingly insidious and sophisticated as **[it can no longer
immediately inspire, impassion or enchant its members]{.underline}**. We
might accept that this is loosely the case, or is at least a plausible
general narrative, but it raises important questions. First, was there
ever a community that did not depend upon a repressive authority
structure? Relatedly, was there ever, and could there ever be, a
community that genuinely impassions its members? Bataille's answer -- at
least at the time of Acéphale -- is an unequivocal yes to both of these
questions. The 'pre-foundations' of Christianity, powerfully visualised
in Van der Weyden's Deposition of Christ (1435) as consisting of a
distraught Mary Magdalene, with Peter, Joseph of Arimathea and a few
others removing a corpse from a cross; the 'pre-foundations' of Buddhism
(Siddhartha's abandonment of a life of comfort and pleasure to confront
suffering); the springing of Dionysus from the dying womb of Semele,
murdered by Zeus: all of these seem to fulfil Bataille's notion of the
vital community of death, a sense of community so forceful that it
provokes the ecstatic frenzy of its followers yet still cannot endure,
lapsing into memorialised 'culture' with the passage of time (Bataille,
1985, pp. 205--206). In making the distinction between a vital,
'impossible' community and the devitalised vestiges of such a community
securing itself through ideological and military structures, Bataille
develops [important sets of relations]{.underline}: between the fullness
or totality of being, and the fragmented or mutilated state of
individual existence; [between the active accumulation of knowledge and
its suspension in ecstatic 'non-knowledge']{.underline}; between an
'external' perspective examining life in terms of substance and objects,
and an internal or 'inner experience' in which substances and objects
are felt to 'dissolve', where the energies, forces and flows that are
obscured by objects are felt with irresistible intensity. These sets of
relations are [vital for]{.underline} an understanding of Bataille's
notion of [community]{.underline}, and also for his writings on
mysticism and inner experience; they also form the basis from which
Bataille develops his more systematic notions of general and restricted
economy in The Accursed Share . Bataille's position on the possibility
of community springs from his passionate anti-individualism, clearly
marked in his earliest writings and developed throughout his career.
Modern life, with its specialised functions and instrumentalism, robs
humans of much of their fullness of being; the modern notion of the
individual is a 'degraded particle lacking reality'. [Life is reduced to
a function]{.underline}: the doctor, priest, teacher, cleaner, or most
mutilated of all, the business leader. The incumbent of each of these
**[roles must absorb the specialised knowledge of their function.
Knowledge itself is mutilated in this process, the general or
overarching perspective is lost and our relations to other people shrink
to the functional level.]{.underline}** [We become increasingly
contemptuous of those who occupy roles other than our own.]{.underline}
in fact, Bataille suggests, it seems as if others, especially those
'lower' on the scale of functions, lack being and seem to be mere
phantoms. Yet, it is not simply that modernity values instrumental or
restricted knowledge over some sense of 'true' or authentic knowledge.
[Knowledge]{.underline} itself [is a restriction of experience: it
alienates the subject from action and experience,]{.underline} whether
this experience is political, erotic, religious or creative, or all of
these simultaneously. The modern [restriction of being to sets of
functions and uses is not at all accidental, nor is it only a by-product
of capitalist accumulation]{.underline}: [it is part of a fundamental
'flight' from being, from the terror of finitude and
insufficiency.]{.underline} Indeed, for Bataille, 'At the basis of human
life there exists a principle of insufficiency . . . a limitless
insufficiency' (Bataille, 1985, p. 172). Everything human reveals this
insufficiency: the genitals declare mortality and the need to reproduce;
the mouth and the anus are evidence of the circulation of energy and the
inevitability of waste and discharge; the skin craves the touch of other
bodies. Language too testifies that being can never be autonomous, that
there is only 'being-in-relation' (p. 174). Being is not merely complex,
it is labyrinthine -- it must wander, and it will lose its way.
Bataille's passionate anti-individualism has led a number of
commentators to term Bataille an anti-humanist (Land, 1992; Noys, 2000).
[This is the case if we take a restricted view of the human, or if we
consider the 'human' to be a product of restriction and
degradation]{.underline}. However, Bataille -- particularly in later
works, but also in the 1930s -- seems to regard the human, at its
limits, to be a magnificent, beautiful, even 'divine' creature. This was
Bataille's attitude to the Chinese torture victim, to Christ on the
cross abandoned both by his followers and by God, and to the emergence
of Homo sapiens from animality. [Human beings are capable of moving
through or beyond the limits imposed by civilisation]{.underline}. This
[happens through the sacred, through art and **literature**, and through
crime and transgression]{.underline}. Human communities and relations
can transcend the level of 'degraded particles', and this transcendence
can endure, at least for a short time: 'The exchange between two human
particles in fact possesses the faculty of surviving momentary
separation' (Bataille, 1985, p. 174). This assertion prefigures
Bataille's development of a general economic thinking on eroticism in
the 1940s and 1950s: 'Men committed to political struggles will never be
able to yield to the truth of eroticism' (1991, p. 191).

[Restricted economies and the knowledge they generate are absolutely
vital and indispensable for society and for thought]{.underline}. Yet,
**[restricted economies cannot function without erecting
limits]{.underline}** and boundaries, and **[there will always be
excesses and indeterminacies permeating these boundaries in any
particular system]{.underline}**. Indeed, [the erection of a boundary or
limit itself generates an 'excess' beyond that limit]{.underline}.
[Restricted economies 'work' only by drawing, selectively and discretely
upon their 'outside']{.underline} -- the realm of general economy --
[and by simultaneously denying that they border an irreducible
'outside']{.underline}. The **[restricted economies of academic
disciplines are generally happy to admit that they have
limits,]{.underline}** of a fuzzy sort, **[but assume that beyond
'their' limit another academic discipline picks up the
baton]{.underline}**. For example, sociology may defer to psychology and
to biology where the functioning of the individual psyche or of the body
are concerned. In concert, [academic disciplines purport to offer a
seamless and limitless coverage of human experience]{.underline}.
Bataille's contention is that [there are inherent and irreducible
excesses, **excesses which must be expelled as a precondition for the
scientific enterprise to begin.** Science is]{.underline}, for Bataille,
[restricted by its underlying foundation in utility -- ultimately in the
profane realm -- so that all sciences must accumulate knowledge that is
of use to society]{.underline}. The accursed share, that which cannot be
reduced to the utilitarian project of scientific thought, is manifest in
paradox, anomaly and in the failure to erect meaningful rather than
simply useful foundations for knowledge. Further, for Bataille, [the
subjective or inner experiences of the thinker]{.underline} -- ~~his or
her~~ \[their\] experiences of wonder, inspiration, mystery, despair and
ecstasy -- [are experiences that can never be formalised as scientific
knowledge]{.underline}, [yet they are the source from which all
scientific knowledge is generated]{.underline}: the pre- or
non-foundations of the scientific enterprise. At the level of thought or
enquiry, general economic thinking affirms and confronts the accursed
share, where restricted economies deny it or avoid confronting its
manifestations.

The [academic discipline of economics is **deeply inadequate to the task
of averting catastrophe** because in it economy is 'studied as if it
were a matter of an isolatable system of operations']{.underline}
(Bataille, 1988a, 19). General economy insists upon interrelations and
interdependence which extend from the microscopic to the cosmological
levels. Economics, as restricted economy, [studies the exploitation of
resources, but it does not enquire into the nature of these resources in
any detail:]{.underline} '[Shouldn't productive activity as a whole be
considered in terms of the modifications it receives from its
surroundings . . . isn't there a need to study the system of human
production and consumption within a much larger framework?]{.underline}'
(Bataille, 1988a, p. 20) For Bataille, [material resources -- wood,
coal, atoms, machinery, and human beings too -- are caught up in the
general economy of excess, expenditure and death]{.underline}.
[Matter]{.underline} is not simply energetic; it [is 'cursed' by an
explosive excess.]{.underline} It is not simply that all things, objects
and materials possess an excess or accursed share. Rather, excess cannot
be contained by the definition and circumscription of life into objects,
things and materials -- these are artificial and idealised constructs.
The [energy of the accursed share precedes the level of things since the
constitution of 'things' already presupposes the control, channelling,
utilization of energy, and the expulsion of unmanageable
excess]{.underline}. 1 Hence from a general economic perspective,
**[there is no growth, only squandering]{.underline}** -- as Bataille
asserts in the opening epigraph to this chapter. Production, development
and accumulation are merely 'ideal' ends imposed by restrictive
economics upon general economy. If we restrict our perspective of living
beings to separate, particular beings -- an individual, a tree, a
village -- these entities can be understood in terms of necessity and
scarcity. Yet the [notions of necessity and scarcity are a function of
the restricted perspective which denies the dynamism and volatility of
matter, its boiling up both within and between beings, in their
relations of attraction and repulsion]{.underline}. In the human realm,
dynamic relations between beings are generated by non-productive
expenditure, through giving, reciprocating or through violence. Further,
human beings are 'privileged' in their ability to experience glorious or
sacrificial expenditure, to partake of the movement of excess in
festivity, in sacrificial religion and in eroticism. Human beings then
have the ability to choose the modes or forms of sacrificial expenditure
'that might suit us. . . . For [if we do not have the force to destroy
the surplus energy ourselves, it cannot be used, and, like an unbroken
animal that cannot be trained, it is this energy that destroys us; it is
we who pay the price for the inevitable explosion']{.underline}
(Bataille, 1988a, p. 24). So [there is a fundamental 'political'
question]{.underline} to be considered: [how should we expend the excess
energies accumulated by modern societies?]{.underline} [**What should
become of the wealth, power, riches, technologies they develop**? No
society, ancient or modern, has found an adequate means to expend
without **diverting excess energy and wealth into war**.]{.underline}
Today, as Bataille notes, **[war -- that is the external channelling of
violence against designated others -- has grown in scale and its
destructive capacity threatens to extinguish all human
life.]{.underline}** For Bataille, then, [it is vital to revolutionise
economic, political and ethical thought simultaneously]{.underline}.
[War can no longer provide a way for societies to expend excess wealth
and energy. Where can excesses be channelled]{.underline}? The answer
for Bataille is that [growth should be immediately 'subordinated to
giving'; commodities should be surrendered without return]{.underline}
(Bataille, 1988a, p. 25). Bataille clearly understood **[excess American
wealth, technology and superpower as a major threat to the human race
and the biosphere]{.underline}**, and he gave qualified support to the
Marshall Plan, an aid package designed to assist European economies
after World War II. This political, or even 'ethical', dimension to
Bataille's notion of the accursed share has, surprisingly, not been
examined in detail by commentaries on Bataille's work. Many gloss over
it (Land, 1992), or assume it is unworkable or contradictory (Bennington
in Bailey-Gill, 1995; Noys, 2000; Gasché, 2012). An exception is Stoekl
(1990; 2007) whose application of general economy to contemporary
society and ecology is discussed in the concluding chapter.
