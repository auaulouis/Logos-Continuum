On one hand are concerns that the expansion of DOD authority has
rendered the State Department unable to carry out its 1961 FAA Section
622(c) oversight responsibility of security assistance and cooperation
activities to ensure a coherent foreign policy. Since 9/11, some
analysts have perceived DOD as acting with growing autonomy,
increasingly independent of State Department direction and supervision.
[The proliferation of DOD **s**ecurity **c**ooperation authorities is
viewed by some analysts as an element of the **militarization** of
foreign policy]{.underline}, with GCCs disproportionately influencing
the tenor of relations with countries in their theaters of operations.36
This viewpoint reflects a broader perception that [DOD's **overwhelming
advantage**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} personnel and [funds allows it
to evade]{.underline} State Department direction and
**[oversight]{.underline}** and [to conduct activities better carried
out by **civilians**, which may be to the detriment of **long-term U.S.
interests**]{.underline}.

As a result, some analysts and practitioners argue that [Congress
should]{.underline} "**[rebalance]{.underline}**" [the **State
Department-DOD**]{.underline} [division of labor by **strengthening**
State Department **input into** and **oversight**]{.underline} [of DOD
**s**ecurity **c**ooperation]{.underline}. [One way]{.underline} to do
so might be to streamline the modes of State Department-DOD cooperation,
an effort that Administration officials state is underway. Another
[would be to expand State Department **oversight
resources**]{.underline}, including new posts in State's Bureau of
Political-Military Affairs, which oversees **[security
assistance]{.underline}**, and at U.S. embassies. Still another might be
to reform the statutory framework, placing some or most DOD security
assistance activities under existing or expanded Title 22 authority or
conducting such activities under an existing or new State Department-DOD
"joint formulation" authority.37

[The Pentagon was **already struggling** to keep up with Congress'
demands for oversight of its spending]{.underline}. Then, lawmakers
earmarked an extra \$40 billion for Ukraine.

Concerns are mounting on Capitol Hill about the Biden administration's
ability to properly account for the unprecedented wave of cash and to
track the thousands of U.S. weapons heading to Ukraine for its war with
Russia. And [given the Pentagon's recent **track record** concerning
congressional oversight, it's coming under **increased
scrutiny**]{.underline} [from members of **both parties**]{.underline}
--- [from]{.underline} progressive Elizabeth [**Warren** to]{.underline}
libertarian **[Rand Paul]{.underline}**.

Some lawmakers are already warning the Biden administration that [a
**future** aid package could **lose**]{.underline} the overwhelming
**[congressional support]{.underline}** [that has been a hallmark of the
previous efforts]{.underline}. A key barometer will be [the
Pentagon's]{.underline} handling and complete [accounting of the
funds]{.underline}, which [has **lagged**]{.underline} in other areas,
[**sparking scrutiny** from congressional committees]{.underline}.

Sen. Warren (D-Mass.), a member of the Armed Services Committee, said in
an email that a full accounting of the already-appropriated funding will
be "critically important for both past and future funding requests."

"The U.S. government is sending billions in humanitarian, economic, and
military assistance to help the Ukrainian people overcome Putin's brutal
war, and the American people expect strong oversight by Congress and
full accounting from the Department of Defense," she added.

Pentagon spokesperson Marine Corps Lt. Col. Anton Semelroth said the
department is "committed" to transparency with the public and with
Congress about the security assistance funds. But he stressed that war
involves risk, and called on Russia to end the conflict.

"Risk of diversion is one of many considerations that we routinely
assess when evaluating any potential arms transfer," Semelroth said. "In
this case, risk would be considerably minimized by the full withdrawal
from Ukraine by Russian forces."

While all Democrats and most Republicans voted for the aid package in
May, [it's **unclear**]{.underline} [whether that coalition can stick
together if]{.underline} President Joe [Biden asks Congress for more
money before the end of the fiscal year]{.underline}, as many on the
Hill predict will be the case. The Pentagon already owes Congress a
backlog of reports on its spending for European security, and
[progressives and conservatives]{.underline} alike have [said they'll be
looking]{.underline} for more cooperation [before approving another cash
infusion.]{.underline}

Amid the Pentagon-Hill squabbling, Biden announced on Wednesday the
first tranche of military assistance from the massive funding bill that
cleared both chambers last month. And oversight concerns are at the
forefront, as the newly announced \$700 million package for the first
time includes a more advanced, precision-guided rocket system that will
allow Ukraine to strike targets even further away --- potentially in
Russia.

The Biden administration deliberated for weeks over whether to send the
High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, known as HIMARS, and medium or
long-range munitions. Officials worried that providing longer-range
rockets could provoke Russian President Vladimir Putin into escalating
the conflict. They ultimately decided to send the shorter-range rockets,
which can reach 48 miles, instead of the longer-range munitions, which
can fly 190 miles.

Officials worry about the department's ability to keep track of all the
weapons the U.S. is providing, including the HIMARS, as well as ensuring
they are being used effectively. Kyiv has given Washington "assurances"
that it will only use the rockets on the battlefield in Ukraine, and not
to strike targets in Russia, senior administration officials said. But
they did not detail those assurances, and there is concern that the
Pentagon has no way to monitor the use of the weapons.

Semelroth said the department is "confident in the Ukrainian
government's ability to appropriately safeguard and account for
transferred U.S.-origin defense equipment," noting that Defense
Secretary Lloyd Austin has underscored the importance of
"accountability" to his Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov.

"Ukrainian leadership have assured us that they understand the
importance of accountability, and we are committed to working with them
to further enhance accountability in the future," Semelroth said.

A senior congressional official familiar with the oversight process
described it as "quite robust" and said the administration has been
briefing Hill committees regularly.

"In most cases, it's munitions going out of our stocks and into the
hands of Ukraine. One Howitzer out for us, one in for them," the
official said, granted anonymity to speak about sensitive briefings.

The \$40 billion legislation includes several measures aimed at beefing
up oversight of the cash. It requires the Pentagon inspector general's
office to review how the Defense Department spends the emergency
funding. It also requires the Pentagon, in coordination with the State
Department, to report to Congress on how weapons and equipment sent to
Ukraine are being accounted for.

Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), a member of the Armed Services Committee,
acknowledged that U.S. weapons sent to war zones have often gone missing
or unused, but said "Ukraine is a different story" because its forces
are well-trained and have been using the weapons for several years
already.

"Obviously, we always have to be on the lookout, but this is not the
same scenario that we have in the past," Gallego said. "There have been
agreements between our governments about \[some of the weapons'\] usage.
And I believe so far Ukraine has abided by all of them."

The Biden administration is using several metrics to determine how best
to allocate the money, including the selection of systems that will help
beat back Russia, but not fuel a wider conflict. Another consideration
is not sending Ukrainians cutting-edge technology, given U.S. concerns
the weapons could fall into Russian hands. If that happened, the
Russians could reverse-engineer those systems and create new weapons for
its military, according to an official with knowledge of the discussions
who was not authorized to speak on the record.

"We in the administration have to very prudently measure those risks ...
and to think very carefully about how can we best ... give the Ukrainian
military what they need," Army Secretary Christine Wormuth told the
Atlantic Council on Tuesday.

The White House is hoping the latest emergency funding measure is enough
to sustain Ukraine through the next several months of the conflict, but
Congress is already bracing for the next cash fight.

At a confirmation hearing last week, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, Biden's
nominee to lead U.S. European Command, indicated that he believed that
Americans are owed "a thoughtful application of those funds and a full
accounting of them."

That's going to be a heavy lift for the Pentagon, which already owes the
Senate Armed Services Committee "several years" worth of reports,
according to Warren. That includes billions of dollars already allocated
for the European Deterrence Initiative, a program aimed at bolstering
U.S. presence on the continent following Russia's 2014 seizure of
Crimea. Warren said she was "getting sick of the run-around here" and
said the Pentagon "has not complied with the law."

In a recent letter to the Pentagon's finance chief obtained by POLITICO,
Warren wrote that "tracking this spending is a key part of how we
protect American interests and support of our allies."

Although every Democrat in both the Senate and House voted for the \$40
billion aid package last month, [several progressives were **reluctant**
to support it given their existing concerns about a **bloated
Pentagon**]{.underline}, as well as their general opposition to flooding
a war zone with new weapons. Congressional leaders significantly boosted
the humanitarian assistance portion, mollifying lawmakers who had
considered voting against the bill.

[Sen. Paul]{.underline} (R-Ky.), who [held up the]{.underline} \$40
billion aid [package amid his demands that Congress tap a special
inspector general to **monitor**]{.underline} [the spending]{.underline}
of the Ukraine funds, has raised similar concerns.

[A **fiscal hawk**]{.underline}, [Paul joined **10** other GOP senators
and **57** House Republicans in voting **against** the aid bill, with
several arguing that there wasn't stringent enough
**oversight**]{.underline} of the money. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) argued
the money "comes \[with\] no meaningful oversight."

The latest round of emergency funding dwarfs an earlier \$14 billion
package enacted by Congress in March and supersizes several programs to
aid Ukraine's military, including \$6 billion for the Ukraine Security
Assistance Initiative, a Pentagon program that helps arm the Ukrainian
military. In a government-wide funding deal passed in March, by
contrast, lawmakers allocated \$300 million for the account.

The package also raises the total authority to ship weapons to Ukraine
from U.S. military inventories to \$11 billion. Additionally, the
Pentagon was granted nearly \$9 billion in new funding to replace
weapons that have been sent into the fight.

#### Oversight-avoidance [causes extreme]{.underline} Congressional backlash

*Rick Berger is a research fellow with the American Enterprise
Institute. He previously served as a staff member on the Senate Budget

A strong U.S. military rests upon broad, bipartisan support among the
American people translated through their representatives in Congress.
Yet, amid the onset of great power competition and a generational
conflict against jihadis, **[[the Pentagon's atrophied outreach to
Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}** has undermined support for the U.S.
military. Although the Pentagon's "[Year Without a
Briefing](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/446363-pentagon-reaches-one-year-without-on-camera-briefing-from-top-spokesperson)"
has rightly garnered a great deal of attention, the American public
isn't the only audience getting the cold shoulder from the Department of
Defense. [**The Pentagon has failed to treat Congress as a partner in
executing America's defense strategy. In explanations both of budget
choices and policy decisions, senior [defense leaders have repeatedly
neglected to invest in]{.mark} [relationship building with Capitol Hill
or to provide sufficient information to lawmakers]{.mark} and senior
staff.** **[This]{.mark} administration's penchant for [secrecy]{.mark}
at the Pentagon further [strains an already dysfunctional
relationship]{.mark} based on mutual distrust**]{.underline}. [[If
Congress believes it hasn't received sufficient answers to its oversight
questions, it responds with public excoriations, punishments and
regulatory actions **that levy inefficiency** on the **daily operations
of the Pentagon**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The building, fearing such
outcomes, refuses to share adequate information with Congress, hoping
that such information can be kept secret, or that congressional
complaints will blow over in time. If nothing else, the
[[silence]{.underline}]{.mark} emanating from the building [[engenders
mistrust and cynicism about the choices the military
makes]{.underline}]{.mark}. Clearly, Congress understands that some of
these strategic messaging and outreach snafus stem from the White House.
In particular, anemic information flow about the president's decision to

border wall funding through the military or the Office of Management and
Budget's abuse of the overseas contingency operations account cannot be
laid at the Pentagon's feet. But [[Capitol Hill has proven much less
forgiving of the Pentagon's failures of communication and lack of
outreach]{.underline}]{.mark}. The department
[struggled](https://warontherocks.com/2019/05/hard-choices-and-strategic-insolvency-where-the-national-defense-strategy-falls-short/)
even to provide a basic account of how the 2020 military budget request
matched the new defense strategy. This year's congressional defense
legislation is [filled with pages and
pages](https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2019/05/28/a-flat-budget-will-prove-fatal-for-military-transformation/) expressing
severe bipartisan displeasure over the Pentagon's lack of documentation
and insufficient justifications for important acquisition decisions. In
early March, Congress learned of the plan to decommission the aircraft
carrier Harry S. Truman from the press, and the rationale behind the
decision remained opaque for weeks.

## MINI-NB'S TO MILITARY AID

### Russian Encirclement

#### Ukraine has not encircled Russia. They'll win

a former Lt. Col. in the U.S. Army; Published: 6-22-2022; Accessed:

KL\]

On Sunday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said "nobody knows"
how long the Russian war in Ukraine might last, but, he added, "we need
to be prepared for it to last years." Retired Army General Jack Keane
told a Fox & Friends audience on Monday that Ukraine had the ability,
will, and troops to win the war. All they lacked, he claimed, "is the
weapons to do it."

[The historical record and a **growing mountain** of
evidence]{.underline}, however, [suggest]{.underline} that such claims
are unrealistically optimistic, as [there is a **growing
possibility**]{.underline} [that the Ukrainian Army may be]{.underline}
**[months away]{.underline}** [from **losing**]{.underline} the ability
to defend the country.

If the two sides do not end the war through negotiations in the coming
months, it is likely -- not just possible -- that Ukraine will lose the
war.

It is time to strip off the rose-colored glasses much of the West has
worn when looking at Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and
acknowledge the cold, hard truth: the Russians are on course to win. The
longer we traffic in the fiction that Ukraine still has a chance, the
more Ukrainian civilians will be killed, the more cities will be
destroyed, and the higher the probability that Russia seizes yet more
territory before a negotiated settlement can end the fighting --
potentially including Kyiv. You'd never know that, however, listening to
high-ranking current and former officials in the West.

Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, hosting a 50-nation Ukraine Defense
Contact Group in Brussels, told his fellow defense secretaries last week
that the West "can't afford to let up," in supplying Ukraine with heavy
weapons in its war against Russia. Implied was the expectation that
supplying heavy weapons to Ukraine will turn the tide of war and allow
Kyiv to win. A study of military history, my own combat experience, and
an honest assessment of the current state of play in the Russia-Ukraine
War all point to the likelihood that Secretary Austin is wrong.

One of the biggest reasons the Allies defeated Nazi Germany in both
North Africa in 1943 and in Normandy after the D-Day landings were
because the Allies had a clear advantage in air power. Field In July
1944, German Marshal Guenther A. F. von Kluge complained to Hitler that
"in the face of the total enemy air superiority, we can adopt no tactics
to compensate for the annihilating power of air except to retire from
the battlefield." Germany still had considerable numbers of infantry and
panzer divisions, but virtually nothing could move on the ground that
wasn't destroyed from the air. Once the Allies had air superiority, it
was only a matter of time before Germany lost.

I was part of the U.S. VII Corps armored force that drove north from
Saudi Arabia in early 1991 to attack Iraqi Republican Guard armored
divisions. Prior to starting our ground attack, the Allied force
conducted 38 straight days of a massive air attack. The U.S. Air Force
took out the majority of Baghdad's air defense capacity in the first
hours, and subsequently made it nearly impossible for their ground
forces to maneuver without getting bombed from the air.

When my unit attacked the Republican Guard forces in the north of
Kuwait, we were free of any concern of enemy air strikes and obliterated
our enemy. The advantages U.S. Forces had in the air against the Germans
in 1944 and against Iraq in 1991 are similar to the advantages Russia
currently possesses over Ukraine. After recovering from their opening
phase disasters, Russian air forces operate with near-impunity in the
air and constrain any movement from Ukrainian troops on the ground. The
UAF's troubles, however, are far from limited to the air.

In just the last few weeks, a number of [Ukrainian officials have begun
**conceding publicly**]{.underline} [that the casualties to its troops
are **far greater**]{.underline} [than had previously been admitted.
They are also **unsustainably high**]{.underline}. Ukrainian
Presidential Advisor David Arakhamia said that [the UAF was suffering up
to **1,000** casualties per day]{.underline}, sometimes losing as many
as 500 killed in a 24 hour period. Adding to Kyiv's woes, the losses in
military kit are even more dire.

[Ukrainian]{.underline} Brig. [Gen]{.underline}. Volodymyr Karpenko, the
Land Forces Logistics Commander of the UAF, [publicly acknowledged that
through nearly four months of fighting, his troops had lost
"approximately **50**%" of their **pre-war** stocks of heavy
weapons]{.underline}, claiming that "1,300 infantry fighting vehicles
have been lost, 400 tanks, 700 artillery systems."

Those numbers of personnel and equipment losses are not surprising in
light of the fact that [Russia has a **20-1** advantage over Ukraine in
artillery]{.underline}, 40-1 advantage in artillery and rocket
ammunition, and a daily air sortie rate of approximately 300 to five. If
every heavy weapon committed to Ukraine by the West were delivered
immediately, it would not represent one tenth of the UAF losses -- and
that they continue to lose on a daily basis, including the 155mm
howitzers provided by the United States.

[In **every measurable** metric]{.underline} that has historically
determined the winner and loser on the battlefield, [Ukraine is at a
major deficit]{.underline}. As should be painfully obvious, there is no
rational basis to hope that Ukraine will stop its bleeding of personnel
and equipment and win the war against Russia. To continue giving
emotional support to Ukrainian leaders and people, encouraging them to
keep fighting, is to set them up for bitter -- and potentially
catastrophic -- failure.

[Security assistance in a **tense era** of **great power
competition**]{.underline} [is extremely sensitive and can increase
**tension** and lead to **miscalc**ulation]{.underline}. [The risk in
**today's geopolitical environment** is that providing **sensitive** and
potentially **provocative** assistance will not receive the same
scrutiny from policymakers and will become the **norm** for]{.underline}
the administering agency, [the DOD]{.underline}. [In the last era of
great power competition, the **Cold War**]{.underline}, [security
assistance]{.underline} often **[stoked tension]{.underline}** [between
the United States and the Soviet Union and led to **spiraling
commitments**]{.underline}. For instance, Soviet provision of nuclear
missiles to Cuba led to a **[nuclear]{.underline}** standoff, while U.S.
military support for Vietnam led to deepening U.S. engagement.

As competition with China and Russia increases, security assistance
could once again prove a major source of tension and cause
[miscalc]{.underline}ulation. Providing aid in this environment is not a
mere technical military matter, but ultimately a political and
diplomatic concern that is highly sensitive. Yet today, it is the DOD
that is driving assistance to countries such as Ukraine and regions such
as Southeast Asia.13 When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, the National
Security Council became significantly involved in policymaking and
limited types of assistance that could be provided, including lethal
aid.14 Such unique scrutiny was warranted because there was a crisis
involving a U.S. partner and a nuclear-armed state. But the nature of
White House intervention was necessary in large part because the
security assistance process---for both decision-making and for providing
assistance---was broken.

[A military-led response can overprioritize military engagement
and]{.underline} could unintentionally [steer]{.underline} American
[engagements into **high-risk** confrontations]{.underline}. [Without
**careful calibration** and understanding of **broader** political
context]{.underline}, [there is **real concern** that the DOD could get
ahead of U.S. policy or drive it in a more **military-centric**
direction]{.underline}. For example, China could interpret the DOD's
provision of some security assistance through the agency's Southeast
Asia Maritime Security Initiative as an act of aggression if it is not
carefully and effectively calibrated against broader political concerns
in the region.15 Given the political sensitivities of great power
competition, [responsibility and **oversight**]{.underline} for security
assistance decisions [should rest with the agency most **in tune** with
broader U.S. foreign policy concerns]{.underline} and diplomatic
developments: [the **State Department**]{.underline}.

[Wars]{.underline} sometimes **[start easily]{.underline}**, but it is a
tenet of strategy that [they are **always unpredictable**]{.underline}
and extremely hard to end. [Putin's war of choice in Ukraine is already
**escalating faster**]{.underline} [than most experts would have
imagined]{.underline} just a week ago. He has now encircled major
Ukrainian cities with his army and threatens to flatten them with
thermobaric weapons, cluster munitions, and guided missiles. This will
terrorize the civilian population and could demoralize the budding
Ukrainian resistance. He could escalate the conflict to another region,
such as the Balkans, where long-standing conflicts fester and Russia has
an extensive network of intelligence and security services. He may turn
the lights off in a major U.S. city with a cyber attack. Most
frighteningly, [he has raised the alert level of **Russian nuclear
forces**]{.underline} and may be considering introducing martial law.

Meanwhile, NATO, the G7, and a host of other countries have turned the
dial of economic punishment up to unprecedented levels. Several European
nations that had previously hesitated to involve themselves militarily
[in]{.underline} the conflict have now done so, sending weapons and
financing Ukraine's resistance. [A growing number of voices]{.underline}
in Washington [are clamoring for a more **aggressive
approach**]{.underline} [from the United States and
**NATO**]{.underline}, [pressuring the White House to
support]{.underline} a Ukrainian insurgency [with a broad menu of
**weaponry**]{.underline} or even calling for NATO to impose a no-fly
zone over Ukraine.

Amid this escalation, experts can spin out an infinite number of
branching scenarios on how this might end. But [scores of **war
games**]{.underline} [conducted for the U.S. and allied governments and
my own experience as the U.S. **national intelligence
officer**]{.underline} for Europe [suggest that if we boil it down,
there are]{.underline} really [only **two paths**]{.underline} toward
ending the war: one, **[continued escalation]{.underline}**, potentially
[across the **nuclear threshold**]{.underline}; [the other]{.underline},
[a bitter peace imposed on a **defeated** Ukraine]{.underline} that will
be extremely hard for the United States and many European allies to
swallow.

\* \* \*

Putin deliberately frames his operation in Ukraine in the same way that
the United States has framed its own regime-change operations in Kosovo,
Iraq, and Libya, charging that Ukraine has committed human rights
violations and is a terrorist state. For good measure, Putin throws in
the ludicrous assertion that Ukraine is fascist. These are transparent
fig leaves for what is nothing more than a war of brute imperialism.

Judging from how things stand now, Putin, having invested so much in
this war already, seems unlikely to settle for anything less than the
complete subjugation of the Ukrainian government. If the current uneven
pace of Russian military progress doesn't accomplish the job, the most
likely strategy for doing this is to make an example of a city like
Kharkiv, leveling it as if it were Grozny or Aleppo, both cities that
Russia has brutally destroyed in the recent past, and then threatening
to burn Kyiv to the ground. He can accompany this with special forces
attacks in the capital to disrupt the civilian population and sow
further confusion and discontent. Ultimately, he needs at least to force
the ouster of President Volodymyr Zelensky and his government.

In this case, Russia will install a puppet government in Kyiv, which
will sign terms of surrender highly favorable to Russia. The terms will
almost certainly include a pledge of Ukrainian neutrality, and might go
further by committing Ukraine formally to Russia's sphere of influence
with a membership in Russia's Collective Security Treaty Organization or
its Eurasian Economic Union.

At this juncture, the United States and its allies would face an
extraordinarily difficult policy choice. Disgust with Putin's war has
greatly increased the chances that Washington and some of its allies
would seek to fight on, for instance by supporting a Ukrainian
insurgency. This would roughly mirror the strategy that the United
States used to assist French resistance against Nazi Germany in World
War II. [The **more effective** NATO support]{.underline} to the
insurgency [is, the more the Kremlin would likely be willing to risk
**attacks** on safe havens in **NATO territory**]{.underline}---most
likely employing irregular forces or even the infamous Wagner Group, a
private organization that operates globally as a quasi-special force of
the Kremlin. [These operations could lead to a **massive
escalation**]{.underline} [that would **open the door** to a **much
wider war** between **NATO** and **Russia**]{.underline}---exactly the
war that U.S. President Joe Biden has been trying to avoid.

Alternatively, the insurgency might greatly weaken Russian forces. The
Ukrainian insurgent army could impose heavy damages on Russian forces
and erode Putin's position among Russian elites, on whose support he
depends for power. Ukrainian forces would have major incentives to take
their fight inside Russian territory, attacking Russia's rearguard in
Belarus and Russia itself.

There are possible [other paths toward further escalation]{.underline},
but they [all eventually lead toward the **nuclear
threshold**.]{.underline} [**Scores** of war games]{.underline} carried
out by the United States and its allies in the wake of Russia's 2014
invasion of Ukraine [make it **clear** that Putin would probably use a
nuclear weapon if he concludes that his **regime is
threatened**]{.underline}. It is hard to know exactly what turn of
events would scare him enough to cross the nuclear threshold. Certainly
a large NATO army entering Russian territory would be enough. But what
if events in Ukraine loosened his grip on power at home? Indeed,
achieving regime change in Russia indirectly by making Putin lose in
Ukraine seems to be the logic behind some of those who are pushing for
escalation today.

Moving across the nuclear threshold wouldn't necessarily mean an
immediate, full-force nuclear exchange---in other words, global
thermonuclear war. But it would be an extremely dangerous, watershed
event in world history.

[The nuclear option]{.underline} that has been most frequently discussed
in the past few days [involves Russia using a **small** nuclear
weapon]{.underline} (a "non-strategic nuclear weapon") against a
specific military target in Ukraine. Such a strike might have a military
purpose, such as destroying an airfield or other military target, but it
would mainly be aimed at demonstrating the will to use nuclear weapons,
or "escalating to de-escalate," and scaring the West into backing down.

Some analysts have questioned Russia's ability to actually carry out
such an operation, given its lack of practice. Unfortunately, this isn't
the only or even the most likely option available to the Kremlin. Based
on war games I ran in the wake of Putin's 2014 invasion, a more likely
option would be a sudden nuclear test or a high-altitude nuclear
detonation that damages the electrical grid over a major Ukrainian or
even NATO city. Think of an explosion that makes the lights go out over
Oslo.

[Those war games indicated that the best U.S. response]{.underline} to
this kind of attack [would be]{.underline} first [to demonstrate U.S.
resolve with a **response in kind**]{.underline}, aimed at a target of
similar value, followed by restraint and diplomatic efforts to
de-escalate. [In most games, Russia still responds with a second nuclear
attack]{.underline}, but in the games that go "well," the United States
and Russia manage to de-escalate after that, although only in
circumstances where both sides have clear political off-ramps and lines
of communication between Moscow and Washington have remained open. [In
all]{.underline} the other [games]{.underline}, [the world is basically
**destroyed**]{.underline}.

[Even in the better case where both sides take their fingers off the
triggers, the **nuclear taboo** has been broken, and we are in an
entirely **new era**]{.underline}: [two nuclear superpowers have used
their nuclear weapons in a war]{.underline}. The proliferation
consequences alone would be far-reaching, as other countries accelerate
their nuclear weapons programs. The very fact that the nuclear taboo had
been broken increases the odds that the nuclear threshold is crossed
again in future conflicts, not just between Russia and America, but also
with China, between India and Pakistan, in the Middle East, or
elsewhere. Even this outcome in which the world is "saved," the United
States is far worse off than it was before the war in Ukraine broke out
last month.

\* \* \*

What is [the alternative]{.underline}? Once again, infinite scenarios
and branches are possible, but [there is a single basic one that helps
to **simplify thinking**]{.underline}. [It begins with an effort to
**avoid further escalation** today]{.underline}. So far, the Biden
administration has wisely restrained direct U.S. military involvement in
the conflict, but holding off against the rising chorus of voices
pushing for escalation may be hard in the coming days if Russian forces
brutally devastate Ukraine's cities. But the most difficult challenge
lies a little further down the road with the scenario described above:
how to respond if Russia imposes a puppet regime in Ukraine. This would
put the United States in the near-impossible position of having to
choose between further escalation and compromising on the very
principles that drove it toward the war in the first place---the right
of a nation like Ukraine to be free and independent of subjugation to
foreign rule.

After the 2014 intervention in Crimea, NATO and western allies started
arming Ukraine. Given by any standard, Ukraine has fairly big armed
forces and NATO provided it with all the big equipment yet it's
leadership rarely showed the strength of a matured nation while dealing
with a country it belonged to once upon a time.

It was clear that Ukraine was clearly divided between ethnicities on the
issue of joining the EU as the Russian origin people were happier with
Russia. [It is not the issue of mere sovereignty]{.underline} of Ukraine
[but also the **survival question**]{.underline} [for Russia which feels
**threatened**]{.underline} [if NATO expands]{.underline} towards the
Eastern Europe.

[**Underestimating** Russian sentiments]{.underline}

Russia is world's biggest country with a 36,000 kilometres long coast
and 17 million square kilometres of land area. It has 11 time zones, the
highest in the world. Whatever may be the differences of governance,
Russia undoubtedly a great power where architecture and literature
thrived.

During the second world war, it is the Red Army of the Soviet Union who
defeated Hitler's fascist forces but it is also a fact that immediately
after world war II, the western block decided to join hand against the
mighty Communist Soviet Union. The cold war started by then though ended
by 1990 when Soviet Union disintegrated but the mighty empire doesn't go
away that easily.

To underestimate Russia and its power was a miscalculation on the part
of the Ukrainian president who now feels that Europe and the United
States have abandoned him and that he was ready for a negotiation with
Moscow but it looks the matter is over. Whatever be the outcome, the
massive bombardment at Ukraine has destroyed his infrastructure as the
war is basically inside Ukraine and Russia has significantly destroyed
its defence infrastructure and captured the Chernobyl Nuclear Power
plant.

The Ukrainian crisis should not escalate but for that western world must
sit together with other nations. Each big country has its share of
problems and exploitation of the other countries. Europe's colonial
powers have their own track record of colonising the world while
Americans have taken it to themselves as the sole spokesperson of the
world. Russia, China are new power places and will definitely not like
to get economically isolated.

China has already challenged the Western monopoly on economy but Russia
was also building up in the last one decade. The new Russia under
Vladimir Putin is assertive, economically strong and militarily stronger
who have shown much better diplomacy than his western counterparts on
various occasions.

Now, the call for negotiations will not work as Russia will only stop
once the regime change is done and a pro-Russian government is installed
in Kyiv and Russians are not alone in doing so, for they have many
examples in recent pasts when the western world followed the same
pattern elsewhere.

The things are clear that [Russia will not allow NATO to move towards
its border as it is a **life and death**]{.underline} [for the powerful
country]{.underline} as it knows well that Western World never want a
strong Russia but will ensure it is weakened or broken. By invading
Ukraine, Putin has sent a strong message to all his neighbours in Europe
and CIS countries to not cross the Red line of inviting the western
world and NATO to its border as it will be a no tolerance zone for
Russia.

One should not look for big moral questions in the Ukraine crisis as
every country has to work according to its territorial integrity and
what [Putin]{.underline} did was perhaps important to [protect Russia
from]{.underline} **[encircling by NATO]{.underline}**. [No
**self-respecting powerful** nation would allow its border to be
**surrounded**]{.underline} [by the adversaries]{.underline}.

Ukraine could have avoided the crisis by not becoming a pawn in the
hands of adversaries of Russia but it looks it deliberately allowed
itself to be used and now paying the price for the same. It is time all
the global power sits together, introspect and strengthen mechanisms so
that rights of all countries whether small or big are protected but at
the same point of time it is also essential that countries do not become
pawns in the hands of powerful countries and their international chess
board.

[The war is not between Moscow and Kyiv but between **Russia and
NATO**]{.underline} [whose tremors are being felt
**globally**]{.underline} [and must not **escalate further** as **any
miscalc**ulation]{.underline} on any part [might begin a chain of event
which could be worse than]{.underline} **[World War III]{.underline}**.

[The **overriding concern** of]{.underline} this week's
[NATO]{.underline} Summit [will be **cohesion**, with the security
alliance facing crises of disunity on **multiple fronts**]{.underline}.
In the West, President Donald Trump repeatedly calls into question
NATO's strategic value and berates America's closest allies. Already, he
has sent hostile letters to the leaders of several NATO member-states
demanding they do more to pay their own way. In the East, an aggressive
Russia has used conventional and nonconventional weapons to invade
sovereign states and undermine European and American security. In
continental Europe, migrant and refugee flows not seen since World War
II are roiling internal politics within frontline and destination
states.

[There is]{.underline} also [**significant** democratic backsliding
among NATO member states]{.underline}. The cast of illiberal
characters---who are leading the charge in the wrong
direction---includes the recently reelected and empowered Turkish
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his Justice and Development Party
(AKP), Jaroslaw Kaczynski's Law and Justice (PiS) Party in Poland, and
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and the ruling Fidesz Party. Each
has proven more than willing to repress free media, dismantle checks and
balances, demonize political opposition, clamp down on civil society,
and diminish the rule of law. America's democratic system and norms
under President Trump are also under duress; as a result, Freedom House
downgraded the country's score on the basis of weakening political
rights and civil liberties.

Despite these alarming developments, NATO leaders have relegated
democratic backsliding to the backburner. Opponents of making the case
for democracy within NATO might argue that pushing Ankara, Warsaw, and
Budapest too hard on their commitments to good governance will
exacerbate already tense divisions in the alliance. Others might say
that Russia would be the prime beneficiary of a contentious democracy
discussion at NATO. Yet this is a counterproductive approach with
current and potential costs to NATO's future. Here are three
security-based reasons why the United States and NATO should care about
democratic backsliding, and actions the alliance can take to address
them.

1 [Russia is]{.underline} already [benefiting from and effectively
leveraging its relationships with **Hungary** and
**Turkey**]{.underline} [to **exacerbate discord** within Europe and
NATO]{.underline}. Viktor Orbán and Vladimir Putin see one another as
allies in their disdain for the European Union and Orbán has courted
Russian financial and political support as he builds an illiberal
democracy in Hungary. Russian propaganda also finds fertile ground in
Hungarian media. A 2018 Senate Foreign Relations Committee report noted
that Russian state-owned media content "by Sputnik and RT is widely
referenced by pro-government news sources in Hungary." The report cited
Orbán as the EU and NATO's most supportive leader of Putin's worldview
and leadership. Acting as the Russian "camel's nose under the tent,"
Orbán is thwarting Ukraine and NATO's partnership efforts by blocking
the Ukraine-NATO Commission from meeting at the upcoming summit.

In Turkey, Erdoğan has rattled the NATO alliance by pursuing a deal to
purchase the S-400 missile system from Russia. In addition to hurting
NATO's ability to cooperate on security, the system is also not
compatible with NATO's defenses. Through arms and energy deals, Putin
uses Turkey as a wedge to divide NATO. Similarly, Erdoğan might see his
deals with Putin as a way to free Turkey from Western leverage,
particularly as European states push back on his brand of authoritarian
politics by cutting EU pre-accession funds. After winning the recent
twin parliamentary and presidential elections, an emboldened Erdoğan
will likely become an even more problematic partner for NATO.

President Putin is building ties with illiberal leaders across Europe
while attacking fundamental elements of Western democracies.

Other illiberal and populist governments, including Italy's new
anti-establishment government, could follow suit in enhancing their
partnerships with Russia, creating future intelligence-sharing and
cohesion problems for the alliance. President Putin is building ties
with illiberal leaders across Europe while attacking fundamental
elements of Western democracies, including electoral process and open
information spaces.

2 [There is a **strong link** between democratic governance and
**security gains**]{.underline}. [Liberal democracies have]{.underline}
historically [been less likely to experience intra- and **interstate
conflict**]{.underline}, generate refugees, and harbor violent
extremists. [They are also better at]{.underline} maintaining
transparent institutions, [**civilian control** of the
military]{.underline} and intelligence services, [and working together
on **c**onfidence-**b**uilding **m**easures]{.underline}, all of which
are [**core** features of NATO's ability to **collectively
defend**]{.underline} [its members]{.underline}. On the other hand,
[**corruption** and **insecurity**]{.underline} [grow under politicized
institutions and poor rule of law. This hurts NATO's renewed efforts to
combat **terrorism**]{.underline}, as military and security communities
have long acknowledged the connection between corruption and the
existence of criminal networks, traffickers, and terrorists within state
borders.

[Corruption also opens space for **Russian kleptocratic networks** close
to Putin to operate and **gain influence**]{.underline}. For example, in
2014 Orbán awarded Rosatom, a Russian state-owned nuclear company, the
sole contract to build two nuclear plants in Hungary in exchange for a
10 billion euro loan from Moscow. The Hungarian parliament, dominated by
Orbán's Fidesz Party, then passed a rushed vote to keep data from the
nuclear deal confidential for 30 years in the name of "national
security." The deal diminished transparent economic competition within
the European Union and solidified Hungary and Russia's energy ties.

3 [Distrust among allies hurts alliance
**interoperability**]{.underline}. The PiS Party's assault on
independent media and the Constitutional Court, including efforts last
week to summarily force out 27 [Polish]{.underline} Supreme Court
[justices]{.underline}, [have **isolated** Poland from France and
Germany, **diminishing trust** among the European nations]{.underline}.
[This could make it **increasingly difficult** for **Washington** to
**gain consensus**]{.underline} on joint decisions, communications, and
operations. If NATO is dedicated to building resiliency along Russia's
periphery by placing multi-national battalions in Poland, then it should
not ignore the accountable institutions that would strengthen this joint
effort.

NEXT STEPS FOR THE ALLIANCE

What can NATO do to counter democratic backsliding within its ranks?
After a troubling G-7 meeting in Canada, the upcoming NATO summit in
Brussels may be a hair twisting exercise in alliance management. Muted
cohesion, however, is not enough to address the anti-democratic trends
tearing apart the fabric of Europe and NATO. Strong actions and words
are needed to counter this democratic crisis.

First, in fighting for the relevance of NATO's Article V promise of
collective defense, we should not forget about NATO's other founding
articles, including Article II: states' promise to strengthen free
institutions within their borders. We should also recall the central
governance requirements that states needed to meet in order to join the
alliance, including rules around civilian control of the military,
legislative monitoring, and transparency of arms procurements---all
democratic foundations that make the alliance stronger.

In practice, NATO needs a new mechanism to hold members accountable when
there is democratic backsliding and when the principles of the
Washington Treaty, NATO's founding document, are violated. Celeste
Wallender, President Obama's special assistant to the president and
senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs at the National
Security Council, argues persuasively for several measures here. As she
and others have noted, NATO currently has no options to suspend, expel,
or penalize a NATO member, for example Hungary, for violating a core
tenet of the alliance's democratic values. There is not even a proper
venue at NATO---for example the North Atlantic Council (NAC), NATO's
main decisionmaking body---to raise matters that some consider a direct
threat to the alliance's core principles. The NAC already has over a
dozen committees, but none deal directly with democratic backsliding and
human rights violations in the alliance.

To fill the void, members at the NATO summit and after should consider
forming a new governance committee that addresses these issues,
established under the chairmanship of NATO's assistant secretary general
for political affairs and security policy. Another idea would be for the
alliance to establish a new role of special ombudsperson to raise
concerns of violations to the Washington treaty.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and NATO member states also have
a key role to play. Stoltenberg should be as ardent at the Summit as he
was at the May 28 NATO Parliamentary Assembly where he reiterated that
"NATO is an alliance of 29 democracies... based on the rule of law,
individual liberty and democracy."

Beyond the NATO Summit, Stoltenberg must elevate NATO's commitment to
democracy and core values by using his authority as secretary general to
propose democracy-related items for discussion in the NAC. Stoltenberg
should also make certain that NATO launches a new strategic concept as
it celebrates its 70th anniversary in 2019. The current NATO strategic
concept, adopted in 2010, is out of date and does not reflect the state
of NATO-Russia relations or address democratic backsliding in the
alliance. A new strategy is essential to address new global security
challenges, including Russian hybrid efforts to undermine democracy and
threats from some NATO members themselves to the stability and security
of the United States and Europe.

At minimum, member states should ensure that language from the 2016
Warsaw Communiqué on democratic institutions (NATO's mission is to
"ensure that the Alliance remains an unparalleled community of freedom,
peace, security, and shared values, including individual liberty, human
rights, democracy, and the rule of law") is strengthened and goes
further in this year's communiqué. Anything less than a reaffirmation of
these principles, coupled with a mechanism to enforce them, would look
like NATO backtracking on its commitment to democracy, emboldening the
likes of Orbán and Putin.

In developing the communiqué's language, the United States and its NATO
allies should use momentum from Assistant Secretary for Europe and
Eurasia Wess Mitchell's recent remarks at the Heritage Foundation, where
he reaffirmed that when it comes to NATO, "\[w\]e have to be clear that
we stand for strong democracy as the foundation of our security and
prosperity." Based on this positioning, Washington would likely support
NATO allies if they insist that democracy, human rights, and rule of law
be a focus of the NATO summit and its communiqué.

Regardless of U.S. leadership or support, other NATO states such as the
Nordic countries, Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and other
members must play a role in prioritizing NATO's core values at the
Brussels Summit and strengthening democratic institutions. In speaking
to diplomats from several member states, it is clear that they recognize
the growing democracy deficit in the alliance, and that the United
States will likely not lead the charge on championing democratic
institutions. In response, officials from such member states can use
bilateral meetings and sideline conversations with the Hungarians,
Poles, and Turks to raise concerns. Already the European Union is
pressing Poland on its violation of EU democratic principles with the
threat of sanctions and suspension of voting privileges. The security
implications of their transgressions give NATO a role in maintaining
this pressure, too.

ON THE HOME FRONT

[The U.S. Congress has shown its mettle to play a greater **foreign
policy leadership role**]{.underline} [through **sanctions
legislation**]{.underline}, **[hearings]{.underline}**, **[democracy
assistance]{.underline}**, [and **blocking arms
sales**]{.underline}---at times in direct contradiction to Trump. Last
year, Congress almost unanimously sought to calm the fears of European
allies over Trump's commitment to NATO by affirming U.S. congressional
support for Article V. As Trump aims to cut funding for democracy
assistance globally, Congress is ensuring that democracy assistance
funding levels meets needs, including in Europe and Eurasia. In April,
Senators James Lankford (R-Okla.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), and Thom
Tillis (R-N.C.) introduced a [bill]{.underline} to [prevent]{.underline}
the transfer of **[F-35]{.underline}** Joint Strike Fighter aircraft [to
Turkey]{.underline}, [citing Turkey's]{.underline} "[reckless governance
and disregard for the rule of law]{.underline}." [Congress]{.underline}
also passed the Global Magnitsky Act, which [authorized sanctions on
Russia and other **human rights** violators]{.underline}.

Moving forward, [Congress can **continue** to make progress on **human
rights**]{.underline} by pressuring the administration to advance three
causes. First, to urge the administration to widen and make additional
sanctions designations under the Global Magnitsky authority. The
administration should encourage allies to adopt their own Global
Magnitsky Act targeting international human rights violators, using the
NATO summit to rally European partners on this issue. Second, for the
administration to use its power to issue visa restrictions on
individuals involved in undermining democratic standards or sanction
individuals who commit human rights abuses. Finally, to stand up for
NATO values of good governance and democracy, and to support critical
allies at this week's summit and beyond. We are already seeing this:
Just last week, a bipartisan group of senators emphasized the importance
of NATO and democratic values.

HOLD THE CENTER DESPITE THE RISKS

Holding NATO's [democratic backsliders]{.underline} to account is not
without risk or consequence, and the effort [is]{.underline} even more
**[complicated]{.underline}** [amid growing competition between the West
and authoritarian states including Russia and China]{.underline}. The
United States and NATO allies must carefully navigate internal NATO
challenges and avoid pushing some members further from the alliance and
closer to Russia. Calling for the defense of democracy could deepen
fissures between democratic and illiberal states that are not going away
anytime soon.

[An even greater risk than Russian short-term exploitation]{.underline},
however, [is a possibility that]{.underline} in 10 years' time [the NATO
alliance becomes **unrecognizable**]{.underline}---[a hybrid club of
**autocratic**]{.underline}, **[illiberal]{.underline}**, and liberal
democratic [states that]{.underline}, devoid of shared values, [do not
agree on security threats or areas for cooperation]{.underline}. In the
long term, dictators tend to maintain their power and legitimacy through
strongmen power plays at home and sometimes abroad. And almost always,
they [leave a legacy of]{.underline} **[destruction]{.underline}**,
[chaos]{.underline}, human rights violations, social strife, and other
grievances. They rarely contribute to international peace, stability,
and prosperity, which are the central objectives of an effective
security alliance.

The alliance should be a clear-eyed about this risk. Like a cancer,
[illiberal practices can **metastasize** if not addressed]{.underline}.
[Deepening autocracy]{.underline} among member states [would be a
**death knell**]{.underline} for NATO as an alliance that has provided
protection for the Euro-Atlantic community over the last 69 years.

Concerns over democratic backsliding can be raised without grandstanding
or high-minded appeals that overly chastise members. Appeals for
democratic institutions and good governance should be investments in new
security initiatives and efforts that address the challenges all member
states face in the fields of cyber, terrorism, and hybrid warfare. All
members should be continuously convinced that their security and
economic prosperity lies most assuredly in the West. Making appeals for
strong democratic institutions and investing in security-based
initiatives do not have to be either-or efforts. Rather, [NATO's best
hope of succeeding in a world of **great power competition** is as a
security alliance of **democracies**]{.underline} [with **transparent
institutions**, strong **r**ule **o**f **l**aw, and leaders
**accountable** to their citizens]{.underline}.

This paper explores whether [**DOS** can more **systematically
incorporate**]{.underline} U.S. [good governance]{.underline} strategic
objectives [into the **oversight**]{.underline} [of **DOD's**
**SC**]{.underline}/SA [programs]{.underline}. Both elements of the
fifth secondary questions (existing trends within the SC/SA context and
whether SA/SC programs support the foreign assistance principle of "do
no harm.") are below.

Although the transparency of whether good governance exists has
increased due to a proliferation in measurement indices, the presence of
good governance around the world is declining. The Freedom of the World
report, published in 1973, was one of the first of more than fifty
different indices that measure the effectiveness of government
institutions. 131 Since 2006, for the ninth consecutive year, the index
reported that the world has seen an overall decline in political rights
and civil liberties. It states that the good governance is under great
threat. 132

Again, [**good governance** occurs when the **ROL** and **human
rights**]{.underline} [are respected, and the state is **responsive**,
**transparent**, and **accountable**]{.underline} [to the people without
**corruption**]{.underline} [or **abuse of power**]{.underline}. Both
Great Britain and the U.S. hold the position that [good governance is
**fundamental**]{.underline} [to **peace** and
**security**]{.underline}, and "is the foundation on which a society is
built."133 According to an anticorruption guide commissioned by USAID,
good governance is a prerequisite to sustainable international aid. 134
The NSS and others hold the position that [authoritarian abuse
is]{.underline} often [a prime cause of **crises**]{.underline} (e.g.,
Syria, South Sudan).135 The country context in which the U.S. operates
is of critical importance.

By definition, [good governance incorporates human rights]{.underline};
[the]{.underline} "[support for universal rights is]{.underline} both
**[fundamental]{.underline}** [to American **leadership**]{.underline}
and a source of our strength in the world."136 In 2009, DoD co-published
an interagency guideline that stated that their "implementation of
current foreign assistance approaches to security and development
\[including\] traditional security assistance . . . equipment and
training" programs should incorporate the "do no harm" guiding
principle.137 In adherence to the basic "do no harm" assistance
principle, SC/SA programs should ensure that they protect, or at least
do not disproportionately harm the fifth of fourteen DOS strategic SC/SA
objectives: 5) Adherence to Norms of Human Rights.138

The establishment of the ROL is a necessary component of good
governance. According to USAID's Guide to Rule of Law Country Analysis,
"[The **underlying malady**]{.underline} \[[of weak ROL
institutions]{.underline}\] [is the power of entrenched political and
economic elites]{.underline} who benefit" from the status quo.139
Throughout the guide, it is emphasized that "[ROL reform must establish
a **respected** and **fair** relationship between the state and society
through **balanced powers**]{.underline}, **[proper
oversight]{.underline}**, [**checks** and **balances**]{.underline},
[and a cultural norm that supports ROL]{.underline}."140 USAID has done
significant work in reducing corruption in scores of countries around
the globe, some of which is outlined in the "Guide for Legal Empowerment
of the Poor." The guide highlights that changing legal text is not
enough to establish good governance. [In order to change behavior to
build the ROL to support good governance, there must also be a change in
**enforcement** and **incentives**]{.underline} [through **appeal
processes**, **audits**, and **limiting discretion**]{.underline}, to
name a few examples.141

As indicated previously, SC/SA programs are often most successful when
they are conducted in permissive environments where there is an
established ROL, and the recipient government is legitimate and is
trusted by its people and has a relatively effective form of
governance.142 Unfortunately, many of the countries the U.S. is
assisting have extremely low levels of transparency, oversight,
accountability, adherence to the ROL, and checks and balances. In 65
percent of the countries Transparency International (TI) studied in
Asia, public trust in the military's ability and will to address
internal corruption was very low.143 Citizens are rightfully concerned.
According to TI's Government Defense Anticorruption Index, [all states
in]{.underline} the Middle East and North Africa
(**[MENA]{.underline}**) [are at high risk of
**corruption**]{.underline} [in the defense sector]{.underline}. The
U.S. supports the UN position that [the lack of trust and risk of
corruption]{.underline} both [pose a grave threat to **regional
security**]{.underline} [and **stability**]{.underline} [by giving
fodder to **extremist** groups]{.underline}, who use citizen
dissatisfaction as a means to question a government's legitimacy. 144

[A large percentage of the SC]{.underline}/SA recipients [score in the
**bottom tier** of]{.underline} the World Justice Project's [Rule of
Law]{.underline} Index.145 For example, using expert surveys, of fifteen
countries studied in Asia, only Japan and South Korea have parliamentary
defense committees that can influence defense ministry decisions and
budgets. According to USAID's "Methodological and Substantive Analysis
of USAID Legislative Strengthening Evaluations, 2003-2015," [parliaments
are an]{.underline} "**[essential]{.underline}**"
**[oversight]{.underline}** [mechanism to help prevent misconduct,
abuse, or the exploitation of power by the military]{.underline}. 146 In
Myanmar, the military funds a significant part of its operations through
the "selling of state resources, the large-scale cultivation and sale of
opium poppies, \[and\] uncontrolled exploitation of natural
resources."147 Yemen's military participates in organized crime that
smuggles oil and drugs, illegally trades arms, and engages in human
trafficking.148

Governance experts, such as TI, Perry Cammack and Yezid Sayigh with the
Carnegie Endowment, contend that [the security of the
**MENA**]{.underline} [region and the world depend upon using the
military as an instrument of national power in a way that upholds
"**accountability**]{.underline} to citizens [and **basic transparency**
through]{.underline} which effective **[independent
oversight]{.underline}** [of **policy**, budgets, and **military
behavior** can be exercised]{.underline}."149 When a single MOD cannot
control its personnel or account for its materiel, the world is less
safe. For example, a United Nation Security Council report found that
[ISIS seized conventional military assets]{.underline} including
vehicles, weapons, and ammunition, sufficient to arm and equip three
divisions---including new and unused surplus materiel.150 Further, [in
the MENA region, military materiel acquisition is procured on an **ad
hoc** basis]{.underline} with desires of certain individuals overriding
technical security needs.151 [Placating the desires of powerful and
potentially corrupt generals can leave **gaps unfilled** in the security
apparatus, potentially creating **critical
vulnerabilities**]{.underline} within the Critical Capabilities (CC) (a
means that is considered a crucial and essential to the accomplishment
of a specified objective) or enablers that are [necessary to accomplish
**long-term U.S. objectives**.]{.underline}

Extent of Corruption in Partner Militaries and Its Effect on U.S.
Security

[Unethical behavior]{.underline} quickly [destroys organizational
**morale**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[cohesion]{.underline}**---
[it undermines the **trust** and **confidence** essential to teamwork
and mission accomplishment]{.underline}. 152

U.S. strategic policy identifies the existence of corruption and poor
governance in other nations to be destabilizing and a threat to U.S.
national security. Case studies in and out of military institutions have
found that corruption and a lack of checks and balances will
"significantly inhibit" SC/SA effectiveness, and that corruption is a
"pervasive threat" to military operations. 153 The need to combat
corruption or its corrosive effects on U.S. strategic objectives is
mentioned a dozen times in the twenty-eight page 2015 National Security
Strategy. Mitigating corruption can support mission operations to reduce
violent extremism, as well as increase government legitimacy and citizen
confidence.

Corruption damages any DOD mission's operational effectiveness and
"erodes the legitimacy and efficacy of an international mission."154
[Corruption can be a source of **conflict**]{.underline}; twelve of the
fifteen lowest ranked countries on Transparency International's (TI)
Corruption Perception Index (CPI) have issues with insurgents or
international security.155 For example, in Indonesia, it is estimated
that 30 percent of the military procurement costs are pilfered through
corruption.156 Generally, if corruption is used to create stability in
the short-term (e.g., using bribes to buy loyalty), [it can create a
system of **impunity**]{.underline} that lacks respect for the rules of
law, [which inherently undermines **mission command**, the **mutual
trust**, understanding, and disciplined initiative that balances
authority, control, and **flexibility**]{.underline} that is
[necessary]{.underline} in order [to]{.underline} gain and [maintain
**decisive action**]{.underline}.

Many officers in DOD believe that corruption is simply part of some
countries' cultures, where citizens have attitudes of resignation to
corruption, and, therefore, nothing can be done to address it. 157
However, citizens know that corruption undermines service delivery,
decreases economic opportunity, and increases inequality. This is why
ISIS propaganda in Iraq and Syria refutes the government as
illegitimate, due in part to its corruption, in order to gain
sympathizers for their cause to overthrow the government.158 [The status
quo does not have to be the end state]{.underline}. In fact, [many
anticorruption programs]{.underline}, which focus on changing the rules
of the game, incentives, or illegal behaviors that undermine the ROL,
[have found **significant success**]{.underline} [when effective
in-depth assessments]{.underline} help [develop programs that are
**tailored**]{.underline} [to specific objectives]{.underline} within a
sector where political will exists. 159

Secondary Question 5B: Do No Harm

[**Well-intentioned** SC]{.underline}/SA programming [can **harm**
partner nations in four ways]{.underline}. **[First]{.underline}**, [the
U.S. could **negatively affect** the **rights** and **protections** of
citizens]{.underline} within a country [if there is a lack of
transparency and checks and balances in the defense
institutions]{.underline}. 160 For example, [when DOD has **ignored**
host nation corruption]{.underline} in the past, which has had
detrimental results. As written in 2016 by Lieutenant General H. R.
McMaster, current U.S. National Security Advisor, "[Paradoxically,
avoiding state building or sidestepping the political causes of state
weakness in the hope of avoiding costly or protracted
commitments]{.underline} often [**increases** costs and extends efforts
in time]{.underline}."161 [In fragile states]{.underline}, the
government often does not have a monopoly on the legitimate use of
force. Therefore, [the default]{.underline} in fragile states
[is]{.underline} often [self-protection forces and]{.underline} other
[powerbrokers]{.underline} providing security, distributing aid,
delivering justice, and supplying jobs in lieu of government
intervention. They operate along ethnic, religious, or tribal lines and
are frequently under political protection.

[While U.S. assistance to self-protection forces may secure short-term
gains]{.underline}, such as in Afghanistan, [these forces over the long
run often **exploit weaknesses**]{.underline} [in the political and
economic systems, and]{.underline} "have a tendency to [evolve into
**predatory** groups]{.underline}, attacking external enemies while
[extorting or preying upon their own community]{.underline}."162 [Such
extortion and corruption]{.underline} actually [reinforce]{.underline}
ethnic, religious, and other [divisions that fuel]{.underline} cycles of
[violence]{.underline}, thereby making peace more difficult and
prolonging the need for international forces. Instead, foreign
assistance should be used to support the government in displacing these
groups. While this thesis does not address conflict countries, it should
be noted that in 2014, DOD concluded that the United States' initial
support of warlords in Afghanistan created an environment that
exacerbated criminal patronage networks and fostered corruption, which
ultimately had significant unintended consequences for U.S. strategy.163

**[Second]{.underline}**, [harm can be done by empowering a military
that already has **undue influence**]{.underline} [in a
country]{.underline} without also strengthening oversight institutions.
[Unmatched military assistance]{.underline} to an already militarized
society [may **tip the scales** of power and permit the military to act
as a tool to]{.underline} "[suppress democratic opposition or
movements]{.underline}."164 In fact, "a coup or attempted coup occurred
once every four months in Latin America (1945-1972), once every seven
months in Asia (1947-1972), \[and\] once every three months in the
Middle East (1949-1972)."165 There have been forty-four coups in West
Africa alone over the last fifty years.166 Not all of these coups were
antidemocratic, not all were successful, and not all of them were even
against democratically elected regimes. Nonetheless, the point remains
that [if SC]{.underline}/SA programs [followed the framework of other
U.S. Government foreign assistance initiatives, security sector programs
would be part of a **multidimensional effort**]{.underline}, and would
incorporate systematic assessments and simultaneously address weak
government policies, inadequate laws, or poorly functioning legislatures
to counterbalance any assistance given to a military with a misbalance
of power. It is USAID's position that when legislative committee and
bill drafter capacity is increased, additional checks and balances on
overly powerful executives or corrupt ministries of defense can be
established as an additional oversight body to safeguard against
power-grabs.167

The importance of establishing oversight mechanisms is repeated
forty-nine times in USAID's Practitioner's Guide for Anticorruption
Programming, yet many of the United States' partners often do not have
these mechanisms in place. [In the MENA region]{.underline}, for
example, [only **two of seventeen** countries studied]{.underline},
[conduct external audits on]{.underline} the ministries of
[defense]{.underline}.168 The USAID Democracy, Human Rights and
Governance (DRG) Strategy identifies Public Financial Management (PFM)
strengthening interventions as a proven method of promoting a culture of
lawfulness. PFM programs increase [auditing and
transparency]{.underline} in accounting, recording, and reporting
processes. This USAID position is partly based on the recent
meta-analysis evidence-based study of impact evaluations by the U4
Anti-Corruption Resource Center, one of the preeminent research
institutions on corruption that receives substantial funding from
multiple G7 countries, that also found that existing
[studies]{.underline} of PFM programs [show that the program had a
**strong impact** on reducing corruption and fraud by changing
incentives and the rules of the game]{.underline}.169

Yemen is a good example of the failure to counterbalances to an overly
powerful executive in relation to the other branches of government.
According to a recent article in Foreign Affairs, former President Ali
Abdullah Saleh used the military to consolidate power through a
patronage-based system for his allies. Specifically, the article states,
"eight years of Western training not only failed to build a military
that could defend the state, but led to a myopic focus on
counterterrorism that accelerated its implosion. The mistakes made in
Yemen---where military trainers were deployed without consideration for
local political dynamics---provide a clear demonstration of the
unintended consequences of a military-centric approach" instead of one
that is systems-based and multidimensional.170 According to
International IDEA, although capable, for the last two years, the Yemen
military has been unable to control the civil war, mostly because the
loyalty of the elite military units is to their politically entrenched
commanders, many of whom are supporting coup efforts. 171 That same
year, the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point Sentinel published
that "Saudi airstrikes, which are supported by U.S. intelligence, have
destroyed much of the country's infrastructure and decimated Yemen's
military and security services, including millions of dollars in
equipment provided by the United States itself\[,\] . . . As a result,
the constant warfare has opened up significant space for al-Qa\`ida" and
ISIS. 172

**[\[FIGURE 4 EXCLUDED\]]{.underline}**

This myopic focus was evident in the budget. As seen in figure 4,
military assistance made up more than 75 percent of the U.S. assistance
to Yemen (\$150 million in Section 1206 funding and \$13 million in
FMF). 173 Yet, according to CRS, such disproportionate funding was given
to the military even though the "Yemeni government, economy, and tribal
and military elites are intertwined in a patronage system that makes
reform efforts difficult."174 According to a CNN report in 2010,
"Officials at the White House and State Department \[were\] concerned
that increasing the size of military assistance might be
counterproductive and not absolutely necessary \[and\] that Yemen
President Ali Abdullah Saleh \[would\] use U.S. weapons against his
political enemies and further destabilize the country." However, the
military assistance was approved anyway because the Yemeni government
"reaffirmed its commitment to fighting militants."175

[Effective foreign assistance uses a systems-based approach that
balances]{.underline} both [governance and security because long term
stability requires both]{.underline}. The counterterrorism assistance
dwarfed humanitarian assistance, in a country that was: a) ranked 167 of
177 countries in Transparency International's 2013 corruption perception
index; and b) ranked 154 out of 187 countries in the United Nations 2014
Human Development Index, in this case partly due to the extreme water
shortages in the country, and the fact that the country is dependent on
food imports for up to 90 percent of basic staples.176 Had some of the
U.S. military assistance been realigned to address issues of good
governance and ROL starting in FY 2010, it is conceivable that the
Houthi rebellion, which was provoked due to issues of perceived
unfairness, may not have occurred or at least could have been
withstood.177 The security assistance may have failed due to the lack of
counterbalancing governance assistance.

[**Third**, if arms sales are made without good strategic
planning]{.underline} or a wellfunctioning force management system,
[**haphazard** arms deals can **undermine** the recipients' security.
This could occur by procuring equipment that is
**unsuitable**]{.underline} to their needs that they cannot properly
utilize, or by acquiring platforms that are too advanced for their needs
or too similar to systems they already possess.178 This lack of
sustainability occurs when SCO's focus on getting the partner nation
what they request instead of what they need.179 Inevitably, many
[countries have acquired **overly technical**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[complex]{.underline}** [systems]{.underline} for
their needs, or purchased "unaffordable fighter jets and buil\[t a\]
pool of pilots when that is [**not appropriate** for the **security
environment**]{.underline} the partner nation faces or its budget."
These are questionable results for the U.S. to permit to occur to a
partnered ally through a U.S. government controlled foreign military
sales system. 180

For the last sixty-five years, claims have been made that U.S. military
assistance has, at times, given modern weapons merely to placate the
political feelings of the recipient, not because such weapons are deemed
essential to the success of a regional security plan. Saudi Arabia's
arsenal includes the Typhoon jet and the F-15 fighter jet, which are
duplicative systems, as well as duplicative tactical troop-carrying
vehicles from Canada, Serbia, and Germany.181 If SC/SA programs were
conducted similarly to other foreign assistance programs, they would be
required to adhere to a rigorous sustainable aid model. For example,
sustainable assistance mandates in USAID's agriculture programs require
the integration of environmental health, economic viability, and social
equity to ensure long-term productivity and not cause subsequent
problems, such as water scarcity. 182

**[Fourth]{.underline}**, [poorly synchronized SC]{.underline}/SA
[programs could harm a PN by **wasting funds**]{.underline} that could
have been more responsibly allocated in a way that benefited the PN's
citizenry. [Quoting DOD SC]{.underline}/SA professionals, [RAND made the
point that]{.underline} many of the existing [train-and-equip
SC]{.underline}/SA [programs are]{.underline} often
"**[episodic]{.underline}** [and generally **not
sustainable**]{.underline}."183 [If SC]{.underline}/SA [practitioners
conducted SC]{.underline}/SA [programs similar to other foreign
assistance programs, they would familiarize themselves with the
**breadth of funds**]{.underline} spent on military and non-military
purposes [to ensure that U.S. SC]{.underline}/SA [programs are not
weakening other]{.underline} U.S. [strategic goals]{.underline} for the
country. 184 [While budget tradeoffs are inevitable, it is better to
have these discussions and make **informed decisions**]{.underline}
[rather than to unknowingly be making decisions because an option was
**never discussed**]{.underline}. Over the last ten years, India has
increased its military spending by 147 percent, Bangladesh by 202
percent, Thailand by 207 percent, and Cambodia by 311 percent. 185 Over
the same time period, military spending as a percentage of GDP in
dropped by almost 25% in Turkey (from 2.8 to 2.1) Singapore (4.4 to
3.2), and Chile (2.5 to 1.9). 186

No U.S. government data could be found regarding the government's
position on whether this was too high, too low, or just right. However,
if SC/SA practitioners conducted SC/SA programs similar to other foreign
assistance programs, part of the SCO's responsibility would be to
understand the international and regional spending average for the
security sector, as well as an objective assessment of the PN's security
needs, in order to help shape national budgetary decisions to align the
nation's spending to the citizen's need for each of the different types
of government services if the PN's spending was severely misaligned with
its own needs. While each PN rightfully has sovereignty to dictate its
own budget, it is common practice in the foreign assistance community to
influence what percentage of a PN's national budget is allocated to
other sectors (e.g. health and education) and the same could be done
with the security sector. From a foreign assistance perspective, the
issue is not necessarily how much military spending went up or down, but
whether foreign assistance practitioners are having the discussion about
budget priorities with their PN counterparts.

Putting It All Together

This paper explores whether DOS can more systematically incorporate U.S.
good governance strategic objectives into the oversight of DOD's SC/SA
programs. To thoroughly discuss this question, five secondary questions
were individually analyzed above. This section attempts to take those
individual analyses and tie them together under sub-components of good
governance: (1) accountability, ROL, and reforming military justice
disciplinary rules; and (2) human rights protections.

In 2010, then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates unabashedly expressed
that "\[b\]uilding the governance and security capacity of other
countries was a critical element of our strategy in the Cold War. But it
is even more urgent in a global security environment where, unlike the
Cold War, the most likely and **[lethal threats]{.underline}** . . .
[will]{.underline} likely [emanate from]{.underline}
**[fractured]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} [**failing** states, rather
than aggressor states]{.underline}."187 However, building institutional
capacity and supporting governance is a long, arduous process that takes
time. [DOD's current SC]{.underline}/SA [system of personnel assignment
creates **rapid turnover**]{.underline} [that **lacks continuity** and
supports tactical level targets in lieu of creating a **unified
effort**]{.underline} [through a **longer-term** operational or
strategic approach]{.underline}.188 [**Guidance** is
needed]{.underline}.

### Entrapment

#### Unchecked military aid breeds terrorism, emboldens allies, and causes [global war]{.underline}. QPQ solves.

**Helton 19** \[Jonathan Helton, research assistant with John E. Talbott
& Associates; \"Military Aid: Financing Foreign Conflict\"; Strategy
Bridge; Published: 8-19-2019; Accessed: 6-25-2022;
https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2019/8/19/military-aid-financing-foreign-conflict;
KL\]

As a concept, [foreign aid]{.underline} has existed for centuries. One
country helps another---usually to their mutual benefit. The Marshall
Plan solidified foreign aid as policy in the United States. The idea was
to bolster its war-ravaged allies in Europe against the rising tide of
communism. In Fiscal Year 2017, the United States doled out roughly \$50
billion in aid, assisting nearly every country.\[1\] The U.S. pursues a
noble goal: To [promote]{.underline} peace and prosperity and to give a
helping hand to countries in need.

Sometimes that goal becomes obscured in light of the **[geopolitical
conflicts]{.underline}** in which the U.S. is commonly involved. During
the American Revolutionary War, the French aided the fledgling United
States because they opposed Great Britain.\[2\] For the French, aid was
more of a weapon than a parcel of food or a life-saving vaccine.

Today, the U.S. provides a similar type of aid. Unlike the muskets and
tents of the Revolutionary War, this aid is spent on U.S.-built military
equipment. Since 1961 the Foreign Military Financing program has
provided "grant assistance for the acquisition of U.S. defense
equipment, services, and training."\[3\] This program differs from
Foreign Military Sales program in that Foreign Military Financing is
grant assistance while Foreign Military Sales are purchased by the
recipient countries.\[4\] The U.S. offers this type of aid to Israel,
Egypt, Jordan, and roughly 30 other countries. A cumulative \$6.1
billion was spent on the program in 2018.\[5\] The same year, the U.S.
spent 84% of it in the Middle East.\[6\]

**[FIGURE EXCLUDED]{.underline}**

Of course, aid structured in this way seems to be straight forward:
American arms manufacturers benefit while its allies receive equipment.
The U.S. keeps the production lines moving and---hypothetically---gains
influence. American allies get weapons. Could this deal be any better? A
more salient question would be: Could this deal get any worse?

One objective of Foreign Military Financing is to further U.S.
interests. The Department of State says, "These grants enable key allies
and friends to improve their defense capabilities, and foster closer
military relationships between the United States and recipient
nations."\[7\] But [Foreign Military Financing fails]{.underline} these
ends. Instead, [this program has often resulted in heightened conflict,
friction]{.underline} between the U.S. and recipient governments, [and
missed opportunities for improving human rights and furthering U.S.
interests]{.underline}.

Countries that receive Foreign Military Financing are less likely to
work with the U.S. in its objectives. A study by Patricia Sullivan,
Brock Tessman, and Xiaojun Li found that the more military aid a country
receives, the more likely it is to be uncooperative with the United
States. They stated, "[There is a **significant**]{.underline},
**[negative]{.underline}** [correlation between levels of]{.underline}
U.S. [military aid and recipient state cooperation]{.underline}." \[8\]
Their reasoning was thus: [Nations receiving military aid realized the
U.S. needed them for **geopolitical reasons**]{.underline}.
[Using]{.underline} "**[reverse leverage]{.underline}**" [these
countries could pursue their own agendas **without fear** of losing
aid]{.underline}. And while there are other factors that determine
whether or not a nation cooperates with the U.S., military aid "Appears
to generate less cooperative behavior from recipient states
overall."\[9\]

COUNTRIES THAT RECEIVE FOREIGN MILITARY FINANCING ARE LESS LIKELY TO
WORK WITH THE U.S. IN ITS OBJECTIVES.

Consider the case of Egypt. Egypt receives \$1.3 billion in Foreign
Military Financing yearly, but the U.S. receives belligerence in
return.\[10\] The Government Accountability Office documented that
Egypt's compliance with State Department monitoring has been,
"incomplete and slow" for certain pieces of equipment.\[11\] This limits
America's ability to determine whether Egypt is using the equipment in
compliance with end-user requirements and if the underlying goals of
providing Foreign Military Financing to Egypt---regional stability and
counterterrorism---are being met.\[12\] Unfortunately, some of Egypt's
internal policies directly contradict these goals. Their harsh treatment
of political prisoners can lead to radicalization, further damaging
American foreign policy and the objectives of Foreign Military
Financing. As Middle East scholar Elliot Abrams stated, "If you take
thousands of young men, toss them into prison, beat and torture them,
incarcerate them for lengthy periods with actual jihadis, what comes out
at the end of the process is in fact more jihadis."\[13\] Policies that
create more terrorism are hardly in line with U.S. objectives.

**[\[FIGURE EXCLUDED\]]{.underline}**

Thus, aiding states that do not cooperate with U.S. objectives can fail
to quell violence in the recipient nation. In fact, [Foreign Military
Financing can lead to **dissonance** between recipient governments and
their people. This dissonance has been **proven** to create more
**terrorism**]{.underline}, not less.

[A paper]{.underline} published by the Hoover Institution [considered
military aid to **106** countries]{.underline}. The authors found that
"[More U.S. military aid]{.underline}... [is associated with poorer
political-institutional conditions, which gives rise to
**grievances**]{.underline} [and **anti-American** terrorism in
aid-receiving countries]{.underline}."\[14\] The authors find [military
aid tends to **corrupt** governments]{.underline}, causing tension over
poor governance [which can lead to **transnational
terrorism**]{.underline}. Seen as the supporter of the corrupt
government, the United States is "Punished in the form of anti-American
terrorism for the---ostensible or actual---facilitation of local
grievances."\[15\]

This effect is not limited to the Middle East. Columbia, for example,
has received almost \$850 million in Foreign Military Financing since
2000.\[16\] Research has shown in Columbia "increases in U.S. military
aid increase paramilitary violence."\[17\] The authors also stated that
"our results suggest that...international military assistance can
strengthen armed non-state actors."\[18\] Thus, it may be that Foreign
Military Financing both distances the U.S. from recipient governments
and incentivizes non-state violence.

But what is the alternative? While Foreign Military Financing seems to
be contrary to U.S. interests, the alternative is hardly more appealing.
Indeed, without Foreign Military Financing, the U.S. may cede
geopolitical ground to adversaries like China and Russia.

An argument in favor of military aid is that it provides a way to
preserve the U.S. edge in the global arms market. While the U.S.---with
36% of the global arms market---leads Russia by fifteen percentage
points, supporters believe that Foreign Military Financing should
continue to buttress that dominance.\[19\] As a former Pentagon official
said, "when American industry is forced to abandon these markets, the
gap is filled by Russian and Chinese companies, and their presence
inhibits future American defense industrial partnerships."\[20\] This
argument is backed up with simple logic: If the U.S. ends military aid,
many nations will turn to other, less scrupulous suppliers.

Arms transfers from Russia or China tend to have similar corrupting
effects to U.S. military aid. A writer with the Oxford Research Group
stated, "Chinese small arms have been implicated in ethnic violence and
war crimes in Sudan, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of
Congo."\[21\] Clearly China takes little care to ensure its arms are not
used improperly. Russia has also demonstrated its willingness to support
corrupt regimes with arms transfers.\[22\] An end to Foreign Military
Financing would simply channel money to America's geopolitical rivals
and possibly worsen conditions in already turbulent areas.

A middle ground ought to be used to manage both Foreign Military
Financing's havoc and the consequences of its reform. If strengthening
U.S. alliances is the program's aim, it ought to be revised to truly do
so. The U.S. should leverage its military aid to ensure that it does the
maximum possible good.

One tool the U.S. already has in its arsenal are Leahy Laws. These laws
can prevent Foreign Military Financing from going to "units of foreign
security forces" who have been credibly implicated "in the commission of
gross violations of human rights."\[23\] While these laws are not
perfect, they may serve as a first step in combating human rights
violations.\[24\]

Beyond Leahy Laws, this [leverage could involve **withholding aid** if
the recipient government takes military actions that are not in
America's favor]{.underline}, creates diplomatic agreements contrary to
U.S. interests, violates international law, or is involved in
large-scale corruption.

But, would such leverage work? [There are]{.underline} in fact
[countries where the U.S. has **applied pressure** and received
**positive returns**]{.underline}. As Jess Hunter-Brown wrote, Leahy
Laws have "coerced accountability for human rights abusers in Indonesia,
Honduras, Guatemala, Colombia, and Bangladesh."\[25\]

There have also been times when leverage has returned mixed results.
Again, consider Egypt. After then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
withheld \$195 million in Foreign Military Financing from Egypt in 2017,
Secretary Mike Pompeo reversed his decision and released it in July of
2018.\[26\] Worse is the fact Egypt was making progress scaling back its
repression of human rights. The Egyptian government was reevaluating its
harsh regulations of non-government organizations and looking at
retrying a 2013 jailing of 43 non-governmental organization
workers.\[27\] Despite Secretary Pompeo's decision, Egypt eventually
acquitted the 43 individuals in December 2018.\[28\]

[The U.S. should even use its leverage to **vet**]{.underline} closer
**[allies]{.underline}**. Israel, one of America's closer in the Middle
East, is rated by Freedom House as "Free"---a top-rated country in the
Middle East-North Africa region.\[29\] But even their democracy is
tainted with accusations of human rights violations. A 2016 letter from
ten senators to then-Secretary of State John Kerry questioned whether
Israel should be investigated for several extrajudicial killings.\[30\]
In 2018, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, rejected
increased scrutiny of Israeli military activities.\[31\] If the Israeli
armed forces are innocent of human rights violations, Ambassador
Friedman should have nothing to fear from further investigation. Either
way, [it would be beneficial for the U.S. to track its **equipment** and
**weapons**]{.underline}---[even to its **allies**]{.underline}---[to
ensure that they are being **used ethically**]{.underline}.

If the U.S. applies strict vetting requirements to military aid, there
is some concern that China or Russia will take market share from the
U.S. However, this concern may be rebutted in two ways. First, Foreign
Military Financing would still come at no monetary cost to the country.
Without it, foreign governments would likely have to spend their tax
dollars to receive arms. Richard Sokolsky and Andrew Miller wrote that
"neither Moscow nor Beijing offers grant assistance, which means they
are not viable substitutes for countries that depend on U.S. financial
help to buy equipment."\[32\]

Second, U.S. military aid is technologically superior to Russian or
Chinese arms in many ways. The U.S. commands a large lead in military
technology. As Professor Jonathan Caverley said, "Clients join an
American-dominated global supply chain in return for better value
weapons, larger orders of subcomponents from local firms, and access to
leading-edge weapons technology."\[33\]

THE U.S. SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID TO END AID TO CERTAIN COUNTRIES, EVEN WITH
THE RISK THAT ONE OF ITS RIVALS WOULD GAIN A FOOTHOLD.

Finally, [if the U.S. cannot leverage aid to achieve its goals, it
should consider **ceasing it**]{.underline}. Foreign Military Financing
has tangible negatives---reduced cooperation and increased transnational
terrorism. These negatives can be avoided via aid cuts. The U.S. should
not be afraid to end aid to certain countries, even with the risk that
one of its rivals would gain a foothold. Just because aid recipients
might hold reverse leverage does not mean the U.S. has none of its own.
Such a cut would likely be net beneficial to an at-risk recipient.

While the aim of Foreign [Military Financing]{.underline} may be to
strengthen U.S. geopolitical alliances, it [has]{.underline} also
[caused]{.underline} [grated nerves and]{.underline} **[violent
conflict]{.underline}**. The alternative---Russian and Chinese arms
transfers---is likely worse for the U.S. Ultimately, [there is
no]{.underline} ideal [option]{.underline}, [but leveraging aid to
improve **human rights**]{.underline} [or protect U.S. objectives is the
least the U.S. can do for a world where weapons can fuel **resentment**
and **strife**.]{.underline}
