[The **biotech industry** in China is relatively
**nascent**]{.underline}. Even though the country's healthcare market is
the second largest
globally[1](https://www.invesco.com/invest-china/en/institutional/insights/china-explained-series-whats-driving-growth-in-chinas-biotech-industry.html#src1),
[biotech-driven treatments account for only **12%** of the China's
**total drug
market**]{.underline}.[2](https://www.invesco.com/invest-china/en/institutional/insights/china-explained-series-whats-driving-growth-in-chinas-biotech-industry.html#src1) [Companies]{.underline}
in this space [are also far behind their global counterparts both in
terms of **revenue** **and R&D investments**]{.underline}. In 2019 for
example, [sales of the top ten biotech drugs]{.underline} (biologics)
[**globally** were in the range of USD **6** to **20** billion while
**Chinese** biologic sales were in the range of RMB **3** to **5**
billion]{.underline} (see Chart 1 and 2).

Yet research firms expect that the mainland [biotech market will be
worth]{.underline} US[\$96 billion by 2023]{.underline} (from US\$40
billion in 2018).3 This is in part [due to the country's **rapidly
ageing population** and **affluent middle class**]{.underline} that is
willing to spend on quality healthcare products and services as outlined
in this earlier piece. Chris Liu, Senior Portfolio Manager within
Invesco's China A Investments team summarizes some other factors driving
the growth of this market.

History and case for biotech

As recently as five years ago, most new drugs in China whether chemical
or biopharmaceutical, came from overseas. Chinese drug makers were
instead focused on producing generic drugs (once the global patents on
these medicines expired. In 2016, for example, generic drugs had a
market share of 95%.4 However, in the past five to ten years, Chinese
companies have been moving up the value chain (see Chart 3). Before
2010, the top 20 China healthcare companies were mostly generic drug
makers, while from 2010-2020, we saw more biological drug companies
emerging in the top 20.

Biotech drugs are now favorable as compared to chemical drugs as they
have fewer side effects. In 2019 for example, seven out of the top ten
bestselling global drugs were biologics (see Chart 1). These drugs are
typically used to treat cancer cells and tumors.

**[Drivers for the interest in biotech:]{.underline}**

[1. **Reduction** in the **prices** of generic drugs]{.underline}

Since 2018, [there have been five rounds of]{.underline} National
Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) [price negotiations for new
drugs]{.underline} (see Table 1). [This has been aimed at reducing the
price burden for patients looking to get their expenses reimbursed under
the national basic medical insurance scheme.]{.underline}

Consequently, generic [drug makers in the country have been pushed to
innovate to make up for this margin correction]{.underline}. Large
Chinese [pharma companies are]{.underline} now [spending more on R&D and
specifically are looking to innovative areas such as oncology
drugs]{.underline}. At the same time biotech companies in China are also
emerging with a shorter history and more concentrated product pipeline.

[2. **Enhancement** and **streamlining** of **regulatory
standards**]{.underline}

The [National Healthcare Security Administration]{.underline} (NHSA) was
set up in 2018, responsible for managing all basic health insurance
schemes in the country. This [represented a milestone in China's health
sector reform to **further improve** the **efficiency** of the
healthcare system in areas such as **cost controls**, **service
quality** and **value** for **money**.]{.underline}5 Since their launch,
the NHSA has added more non-generic drugs to the list of those that
qualify for patient reimbursement.6 Specifically, anticancer "PD-1"
drugs have been included into drug list which are a key focus area for
biotech players.7

The National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), a bureau set up for
approval process of new drugs, was also rebranded in 2018 and has since
been employing a clearer and more efficient drug-approval system based
on global standards (while it took much longer to get new drugs approved
with the previous system8). This transformation is also expected to
shift the healthcare industry's focus from generic to innovative drug
development.9

[3. **Access to capital**]{.underline}

As of mid-2018, [Hong Kong's stock exchange amended its listing rules to
allow for qualified biotech companies to list on the exchange without
earnings. This was a significant step in providing Chinese biotech firms
with more access to capital to fuel R&D]{.underline}. Later in 2019, the
Shanghai Stock Exchange officially launched the STAR Market (the Science
and Technology Innovation Board), with a focus on supporting high and
new technology industries and strategic emerging industries.10 As part
of this, the China Securities Regulatory Commission has been able to
fast-track approval for the listing of high-tech unicorns including
biotechs.11 Apart from public channels, private equity and venture
capital investment in this space is also growing rapidly.12

[4. **Prospect** of **global market demand**]{.underline}

[Onshore biotech firms]{.underline} are currently competing heavily with
foreign players to capture domestic market share. However, many
[are]{.underline} also [setting their sights farther afield and are
looking to tap into the vast global market in the long run.]{.underline}
In 2019 for example, a domestic biotech company's lymphoma treatment was
approved by the US FDA - the first China-discovered innovative cancer
drug to win such approval.13 Earlier this year the same company signed a
\$2.2-billion deal with a global pharmaceutical giant to license their
PD-1 drug in major markets outside of the country.14 A few other biotech
companies have also had licensing deals with global MNCs to obtain FDA
approval for their new biological drugs to be sold in the US and other
countries.

### 2AC -- AT: Conventional Substitution Turn

#### They're complementary -- Ukraine proves.

**DSU 22** -- Microsoft's Digital Security Unit, 4/27/2022, \"Special
Report: Ukraine,\"
https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4Vwwd, RMax

[Throughout this conflict, we have observed Russian]{.underline} nation
state [**cyber actors** conducting **intrusions** in **concert** with
**kinetic military action**]{.underline}.

At least six Russian Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
[actors]{.underline} and other unattributed threats, [have conducted
**destructive attacks**, espionage operations, or both, while Russian
**military forces** attack the country by land, air, and
sea]{.underline}. It is unclear whether computer network operators and
physical forces are just independently pursuing a common set of
priorities or actively coordinating. However, [**collectively**, the
**cyber** and **kinetic actions** work to **disrupt** or **degrade
Ukrainian government and military functions** and undermine the public's
trust in those same institutions.]{.underline}

Destructive attacks have been a prominent component of Russian cyber
operations during conflict.

A day before the military invasion, operators associated with the GRU,
Russia's military intelligence service, launched destructive wiper
attacks on hundreds of systems in Ukrainian government, IT, energy, and
financial organizations. Since then, the activity we have observed has
included attempts to destroy, disrupt, or infiltrate networks of
government agencies, and a wide range of critical infrastructure
organizations, which Russian military forces have in some cases targeted
with ground attacks and missile strikes. These network operations have
at times not only degraded the functions of the targeted organizations
but sought to disrupt citizens' access to reliable information and
critical life services, and to shake confidence in the country's
leadership.

[Based on Russian military goals for information warfare, these actions
are likely aimed at undermining Ukraine's political will and ability to
continue the fight, while facilitating collection of intelligence that
could provide **tactical** or **strategic advantages** to **Russian
forces.**]{.underline} Through our engagements with customers in
Ukraine, we have observed that Russia's computer-enabled efforts have
had an impact in terms of technical disruption of services and causing a
chaotic information environment, but Microsoft is not able to evaluate
their broader strategic impact.
