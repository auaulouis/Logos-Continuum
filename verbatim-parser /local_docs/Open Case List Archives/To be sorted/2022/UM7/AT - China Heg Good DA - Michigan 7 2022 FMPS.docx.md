**precluding**]{.mark} **the emergence of [another bipolar
world]{.mark}**]{.underline}---as in the Cold War---[[or]{.mark} a world
of **[many]{.mark} great [powers]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as existed
before the two world wars. [[Multipolarity led to]{.mark} two [world
wars]{.mark} and [bipolarity resulted in]{.mark} a]{.underline}
protracted [worldwide struggle with the [**risk of nuclear
annihilation**. To avoid a return]{.mark} such
circumstances]{.underline}, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney ultimately
agreed that [[our objective must be to prevent a hostile power to
dominate a "critical region]{.mark}," which would]{.underline} give it
the resources, industrial capabilities and population to **[pose a
global challenge]{.underline}**. This insight has guided U.S. defense
policy throughout the post--Cold War era.

[[Giving major powers the green light]{.mark} to establish spheres of
influence [would produce a multipolar world and
**risk**]{.mark}]{.underline} the return of **[[war between]{.mark} the
[major powers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Without a stabilizing U.S.
presence in the Persian Gulf and U.S. relationships with Jordan and the
Gulf States, Iran could shut down oil shipments in its supposed sphere
of influence. A similar scenario in fact played out during the 1987
"tanker war" of the Iran-Iraq war, which eventually escalated into a
direct military conflict between the United States and Iran. Iran's
nuclear program makes these scenarios even more dangerous.

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[can
manage the rise]{.mark} and resurgence [of great powers like **China,
Russia and Iran**]{.mark} at an acceptable cost [without ceding]{.mark}
entire [spheres of influence]{.mark}]{.underline}. The key is to focus
on normalizing the geopolitics of the Middle East, Europe and the
Asia-Pacific, which the United States can do by strengthening its
transatlantic and transpacific alliances and adapting them to the new,
dangerous circumstances on the horizon. [The U]{.underline}nited

actors]{.underline}.

States to become the biggest economy in the world,"

[For decades, it has been one of the great truisms of global foreign
policy; the \"inexorable rise of China]{.underline}\". [Never a question
of if but only when]{.underline}, [the betting amongst academics,
politicians and diplomats has concentrated on how long it would take for
China to overtake the United States as the world\'s biggest
economy]{.underline}. Its sheer size, both in terms of land mass and
population, made it [seemingly inevitable as the economy
developed]{.underline} and living standards soared in one of history\'s
fastest transitions from a Third World agrarian nation to a highly
urbanised society**[. But the path to becoming the biggest is becoming
increasingly hazardous]{.underline}**. [China is experiencing serious
growing pains]{.underline}. The easy gains have been extracted and [many
pundits are winding back those ambitious straight-line extrapolations of
continuous growth]{.underline}. Even then, there are various ways to
measure size. [Time to scale back the growth prospects]{.underline} [A
new study]{.underline} by Lowy Institute researchers Roland Rajah and
Alyssa Leng [casts doubt upon the speed with which China can achieve the
dubious honour of claiming the crown]{.underline} and [questions whether
it will ever become the most powerful]{.underline}. \"[China would
overtake the United States]{.underline} to become the world\'s largest
economy in nominal US dollar [terms by about 2030]{.underline},\" the
report\'s authors conclude. \"**[But it would never establish a
meaningful lead]{.underline}** \... and [would remain far less
prosperous and productive per person than America]{.underline}, even by
mid-century.\" Most research concludes that China will be able to motor
along with around 5 per cent annual economic growth until 2050. If it
did, it would be the world\'s biggest economy by a country mile, with
the capacity to be its own bloc. It is those kinds of [projections that
have created fear and angst among many Western nations]{.underline},
including Australia, [on how best to deal with a global economic
powerhouse]{.underline} of such magnitude that does not adhere to
democratic norms. [This new study paints a vastly different picture of
the future]{.underline}. Rather than 5 per cent growth, it [forecasts
growth of around 2 to 3 per cent a year]{.underline}, which has
[significant ramifications for the balance of global power and a major
impact on China\'s internal politics]{.underline}. \"[With slower
growth, China\'s progress in catching up to rich country average living
standards and productivity levels would remain significantly incomplete,
even by mid-century]{.underline},\" the study says. \"On the one hand,
the average person in China would be 2 to 3 times richer by 2050
compared to today and 2.5 to 3.5 times more productive. \"Nonetheless[,
China would still be much poorer and less productive than the United
States]{.underline}, based on current expectations of future US growth
at around 1.6 per cent a year on average.\" [By 2050, the authors
calculate the average person in China would be only 40 per cent as rich
as the average American]{.underline} and about half as productive. More
than just teething problems [The early gains were easy]{.underline}.
From an economy largely run by the state, allowing individuals to own
and operate their own businesses sent growth soaring. Global capital
poured in, providing cheap investment and employment. [But those easy
gains no longer are available]{.underline}. And the [ongoing fracturing
in relations between the West and an inward looking
Beijing]{.underline}, accelerated by Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine,
[will likely continue to see a slowing and perhaps withdrawal of foreign
investment]{.underline}. In recent years, it has faced a [series of
crises fuelled by mounting debts]{.underline} which have [seen a sharp
uptick in defaults within private and government owned
businesses]{.underline}, most recently concentrated within the property
sector and companies such as Evergrande. Putting aside poor
productivity, [debt and overinvestment in infrastructure]{.underline},
the Lowy Institute report cites another issue as the [biggest overall
impediment to China\'s future]{.underline}; its ageing population and
the legacy of its draconian past one child policy. \"[China\'s working
age population has been shrinking since the middle of last
decade]{.underline},\" it says. \"The [fertility rate has fallen
rapidly]{.underline} over the past decade to just 1.3 births per woman
in 2020 --- well below the replacement rate of 2.1.\" By 2050, China\'s
working age population will have shrunk by around 220 million, which is
around a fifth of its current level, with those aged over 65 making up
about a quarter of the population. The authors conclude that you can
never completely rule out the prospect China could rule the world, [the
chances of such are nowhere near as likely as most studies would
indicate]{.underline}. \"But it would require an enormous degree of
success with productivity enhancing reforms well beyond China\'s track
record to date,\" they argue. \"[It should not be the baseline
expectation.]{.underline}\"

There is an [ongoing discussion that China is emerging as a new
superpower and replacing the US from the global power
structure]{.underline}. [China emerging strongly from the growing global
economic crisis]{.underline} due to the Covid-19 pandemic and Donald
[Trump's ally-alienating policies within NATO for the last four years
have pushed this narrative forward considerably]{.underline}. [There is
no doubt that China has already become the global
powerhouse]{.underline} economically, and is [expected to surpass the US
as the world's biggest economy]{.underline} by 2028. [China is still
behind but on its way to surpassing the US in military
power]{.underline} with increased spending on weapons technology and
developing several secretive weapons. [There is no doubt over China
acquiring economic and military strength superior to the US sooner than
late]{.underline}r, but [the question is]{.underline}, [can the
Communist Party-led China be ever as formidable and complete a
superpower]{.underline} as the US has been for the last eight decades?
[When the Soviet Union competed with the US to claim superpower status
during the Cold War period]{.underline}, [it somewhat matched America's
strength in leading alliances and military power]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, at the height of its power, [the Soviet Union was
never a match for US domination economically or culturally]{.underline}.
Like the Soviet Union in the past, [China now faces several geopolitical
and cultural challenges before it can reach global superpower
status]{.underline} similar to the US. [China can't aspire to get the
same respect and acceptance worldwide,]{.underline} even if its economic
and military power overtakes the US. [A democratic US will always have
ideological, political, and cultural superiority compared to a Communist
China]{.underline}. One-party Communist country [Although China has
developed a hybrid system]{.underline} to grow spectacularly on the
economic front[, it is still a one-party Communist country]{.underline}.
Politically, [it has become further closed and centralised than ever
before]{.underline}. The Chinese Communist Party is celebrating its
100th anniversary this year. In 2011, when it was celebrating its 90th
anniversary, I was fortunate to attend an invite-only meeting of the
Chinese Political Science Association in Shanghai. Many top Chinese
political scientists openly discussed the possibilities of China opening
up to a multi-party electoral system. That sort of discussion is almost
impossible to imagine in Xi Jinping-led China now. [No doubt, China is a
strong state with a powerful party bureaucracy, but its politics is
potentially very fragile.]{.underline} Under a closed system, [it is
almost impossible to predict when that spark will arrive to ignite a
political upheaval]{.underline}. This is a country where the Interpol
chief or a globally famous billionaire can disappear without any
official explanation. Hundreds of Chinese millionaires have been living
abroad to protect their wealth from future uncertainties and to avail
the opportunities of open societies. [China has become
rich]{.underline}, it is spending heavily on its university education,
[but 600,000 Chinese students go abroad for their higher studies every
year]{.underline}. [China's economy might be booming for decades, but 10
million Chinese have traveled to other countries to find
jobs]{.underline} while 51 million people from all over the world have
moved to the US for better work and improved living. Tough neighbourhood
Despite its ongoing political troubles, there is no doubt that [the
American political system is resilient to any attack from destabilising
forces]{.underline}. But [that sort of trust in the system continues to
elude China]{.underline}. Though China has been enjoying political
stability for long, [the Chinese people don't have similar trust and
confidence in their political system as the Americans]{.underline} have
in theirs. This will not help China command the respect of other
countries in its competition to become the global superpower.
[Geopolitics also does not favour China]{.underline} as it has the US.
Unlike the US, [China is surrounded by several powerful and competing
countries]{.underline}. Among them, at least two, [Russia and
India]{.underline}, [see the dream of becoming superpowers]{.underline}.
China has also fought wars against them and continues to have several
border disputes. [China is neither safe nor secure in its neighbourhood
to freely engage in political and military projects]{.underline} in
other parts of the world as the US does. Besides [China]{.underline}'s
location in a tough neighbourhood, it also [lacks trusted, powerful
allies]{.underline}. On the one hand, the democratic US has established
strong political and military cooperation with many regionally powerful
countries like the UK, Germany, Japan, and Australia from the Cold War
days. It continues to keep those allies, while getting new ones like
India. On the other hand, [China's only significant ally in the world is
Russia, but that alliance suffers from many contradictions]{.underline}
and has not passed the test of time. [It will be hard to imagine China
gaining the upper hand militarily, economically, and politically in the
future]{.underline}, vis-à-vis the US and its allies' combined forces.
The US stands firm [The US has been and will continue to be the global
cultural superpower, and there is **minimal possibility of China posing
any serious challeng**e to that status]{.underline}. Not only does its
democracy and freedom provide ideological superiority to the US, its
cultural influence through movies, media, music, and literature also
extends across the world. The US is a country of immigrants, and it
represents and enriches the cultures and ideas of the world. But China
has remained a closed country for long. While English remains the
world's language, it is almost impossible to imagine Mandarin taking up
that place. [China will always be struggling to catch up to the
US]{.underline} and take the lead position in the global power race.
Like the Soviet Union, its superpower status will be limited and
confined to certain aspects of it. [The US has everything to hold its
own long in this competition if it doesn't often engage in
self-sabotaging acts]{.underline} like it has in the last four years.

"Three reasons why China won't overtake the US anytime soon,"

It's in the nature of human beings, and countries, to want to be at an
advantage over others. In that sense, history may be seen as a record of
competitions for dominance. Another heated battle for dominance is
unfolding today. We see signs of it in the conflict between the US and
Russia over Ukraine. An even more [intense competition is taking place
between the US and China]{.underline}. In terms of economic might,
[China has reached a level where it poses a threat to the
US]{.underline}. [Dominance is decided as much by economic power as by
military strength]{.underline}. [It's natural for the US to feel
threatened by China's pursuit]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} some
Westerners' **[claims that China is poised to surpass the US should be
seen as exaggerated]{.underline}**. [China has more weaknesses than
people realize]{.underline}. [Demographic issues]{.underline} China is a
massive country. As of 2020, its population was counted at 1.41 billion.
In terms of population, China is over four times larger than the US,
which has around 330 million people. Gross domestic product (GDP) is
calculated by multiplying productivity by the population. [A higher
population is clearly an advantage for a higher GDP]{.underline}. That
fact serves as the basis for most of the predictions that have the
Chinese economy poised to surpass the US economy in view of past growth
rate trends. But those [predictions are mere conjecture]{.underline},
[which fails to take into account qualitative aspects related to the
population]{.underline}. In China's case, the qualitative aspects of its
population are starting to have a negative impact on growth. In many
countries, the pandemic served as a mechanism lowering the birth rate.
When entire families are forced to remain at home, that translates for
most households into greater fears for the future. As financial
difficulties are factored in, stress levels escalate even further. It's
not the sort of climate that would put anyone in the mood. [China's
disease containment measures have been particularly extreme]{.underline}
in comparison with other countries. People are barred from going outside
at all. [This inevitably leads to greater stress for
households]{.underline}. Under the circumstances, the chances of the low
birth rate rebounding are effectively zero. The decline in China's birth
rate dates back to before the pandemic. The country abolished its
one-child policy in 2016, but that alone is not enough to boost the
birth rate. Simply changing the laws is not going to instantly wipe away
memories of decades of education instructing people that they were only
allowed to have one child, with punishments for those who violated the
rule. The total fertility rate, which represents the average number of
children that a woman of childbearing potential (aged 15 to 49) is
expected to bear over the course of her life, remains down at 1.3. The
situation has only gotten worse during the pandemic. According to the
National Bureau of Statistics of China, around 10.6 million children
were born in China in 2021. That's compared to around 12 million in 2020
--- showing that the various incentive measures haven't been effective.
For 2021, the number of births and deaths was roughly equivalent.
[Without people coming in from outside, China is poised to shortly face
a population decline]{.underline}. A declining population doesn't
necessarily spell doom for GDP growth. You can still achieve growth
through increased productivity. The [problem arises when the population
decline occurs in tandem with an aging population]{.underline}. In this
case, senior citizens leave the labor market faster than young people
arrive to take their place. It's a problem that a lot of countries are
facing, and it's especially noticeable in China. [Unless "Xi Jinping's
China" can solve it, a scenario where China surpasses the US may be
unlikely]{.underline}. [Lack of soft power]{.underline} Even without the
US reining it in, [China is unlikely to surpass the US]{.underline}. The
reason has to do with its lack of soft power. [Soft power can be seen as
the finishing touch on a country's dominance]{.underline} or standing.
You can't assume control of the world unless you can dominate through
cultural products. [At the moment, US cultural products are in a league
of their own]{.underline}, circulating all around the world. Even in the
21st century, the US remains massively influential with its films and
television series. What about [China]{.underline}? Despite its long
history and time-honored traditions, it has [produced nothing to boast
about]{.underline} in terms of cultural products. China may have the
economic might to threaten the US, but [in terms of soft power, it is
still in its infancy]{.underline}. Over the four decades since it
implemented reforms and openness, it has achieved global success with
exactly two of its cultural products: Liu Cixin's science fiction novel
"The Three-Body Problem" and the short-form video service TikTok. Even
those successes can only be viewed as partial. "The Three-Body Problem"
won Liu the Hugo Award in 2015 --- an honor that could be called the
Nobel of science fiction. He was the first Asian to achieve that.
Without question, the book is a work of genius. But its success is still
only within the narrow confines of the science fiction genre. Not only
has it failed to broaden its base, but the follow-ups have been
underwhelming. We see a similar situation with TikTok. Owing to a lack
of Chinese content, it hasn't served as a window for distributing
culture. Among Asian countries, soft power has been growing by the day
in South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. South Korea's popular music, films,
and television series have joined the ranks of the world-class. Japanese
animation remains influential as well. Yet [China]{.underline}, a
country seen as synonymous with Asian civilization, [has yet to develop
soft power]{.underline}. The reason for that is self-evident: [the state
itself clamps down on creativity]{.underline}. "The Three-Body Problem"
was able to gain worldwide acclaim thanks to celebrities who actively
promoted the book in various media. This is unimaginable in China right
now. [Chinese authorities thoroughly regulate speech unrelated to
patriotism or everyday life.]{.underline} When channels of speech are
obstructed, creativity dies out. Though Asian culture is now widely
consumed in the West, Chinese culture's share of the market is minimal
at best. China clearly has a rich and lively culture. The problem is its
government, which isn't very interested in encouraging or enhancing
cultural activity within its borders. The Chinese government believes
information hinders stability. Under such circumstances, the promotion
of Chinese culture abroad becomes a complicated matter. The Chinese
government also partially blocks the influx of foreign cultural products
into China. It's only natural that Chinese culture is enjoying
diminishing opportunities to globalize. Aside from censorship,
indifference is another factor that's further isolating Chinese culture
from the world. China's insistence on doing everything the Chinese way
itself is causing the country's soft power to languish.
[This]{.underline} in turn [has inevitably led to the decline of the
competitiveness of China and its companies]{.underline}. [Debt and
inequality]{.underline} Astronomical debt and severe inequality are
other main factors impeding growth for China. While the latter is a big
problem in and of itself, the bigger problem is that [China is
attempting to solve the issue of inequality through force]{.underline}.
The [country's push for "common prosperity" will ultimately undermine
its growth potential]{.underline}, as it will surely hurt the vitality
of Chinese corporations. Private enterprises in China are rapidly
becoming public under state control. Though the country's authorities
dream of realizing Chinese-style capitalism, such an approach may
[weaken entrepreneurship and temper the competitiveness of Chinese
businesses]{.underline} in the long run. While the approach can
effectively foster growth in fledgling industries, it will negatively
impact industries that call for creativity and a daring spirit. [Though
China is attempting to redesign its economic and financial systems
without destabilizing its society, it's unclear whether this can be done
without any changes in its governing system]{.underline}, the
fundamental source of inequality in China. Chinese President Xi Jinping
must simultaneously accomplish two seemingly contradictory goals, the
very goals that past Chinese leaders strived to realize for centuries:
growth and equality. Unfortunately, the path to these destinations is
long and winding, and inequality is only worsening in China. [Debt is
another serious problem in the country]{.underline}, especially that of
local governments. The real estate market, comprising 30% of China's
GDP, was what mainly powered the Chinese economy. But the debt explosion
triggered by the bankruptcy of the China Evergrande Group may end up
affecting local governments, who up until now made up for budgetary
deficits by selling land to real estate developers. Now, this has become
impossible. The finances of local governments will slowly deteriorate,
and regional disparity will intensify. The conflict between the wealthy
coastal region and the poor western region may come to light and lead to
social unrest. The Chinese government has designated zero COVID,
economic growth of 5%, and debt reduction as its three main policy
objectives. Already, the last goal is falling by the wayside due to
concerns that austerity measures for the purpose of debt reduction and
stabilization will cause economic stagnation. That being the case, will
China be able to achieve its other two goals? China's zero-COVID policy
has been put in jeopardy due to the emergence of the highly
transmissible Omicron variant. Because of China's track record of low
caseloads, only a small number of Chinese people have developed natural
immunity against the COVID-19 virus. The effectiveness of Chinese
vaccines is also questionable. Rigid lockdowns for the sake of zero
COVID transmission are impediments to growth in and of themselves. If
lockdowns fail, China may be subject to the kind of economic chaos that
swept the world early in the pandemic. Countries around the world are
suffering from the consequences of COVID-19 --- China won't be the
exception for long. What's meant to happen is bound to happen. Will
China be able to achieve a 5% economic growth under these circumstances?
[Pax Americana's long run]{.underline} [It was once projected that
Japan]{.underline}, which entered the ranks of wealthy nations before
becoming an aging society, [would outpace the US in terms of its
economy]{.underline}. [This turned out to be a mere pipe
dream]{.underline}. What then of China? [China's population is already
aging when the country has yet to accumulate much wealth]{.underline}.
[Astronomical expenses will be needed t]{.underline}o make sure its
aging population doesn't tip China into social unrest. [The cost may be
too much for China to handle]{.underline}. To make matters worse, Xi
Jinping is pressuring corporations, the backbone of economic growth.
More importantly, [China can no longer boast low-cost labor as its
strength]{.underline}. The country is losing its competitive edge in
labor-intensive industries. But this doesn't mean the country has become
competitive enough in high-tech industries with high added value. [These
factors can all contribute to social instability]{.underline}.
Considering all this, [it's baseless, wishful thinking to imagine China
coming out victorious in its race against the US]{.underline}. The
above-mentioned issues must be resolved for China to gain an upper hand
in its competition with the North American powerhouse. Whether China is
capable of overcoming these challenges under its current governing
system is open to doubt. There are limits to the ruling class's ability
to better itself. The solution has to be structural. But to expect this
of an unchecked power is in itself a contradiction. Then, [it's clear
what the outcome will be of the hegemonic competition between the US and
China]{.underline}. [Pax Americana may continue]{.underline} on longer
than one might think.

[China's coronavirus lockdowns mean its economic growth may undershoot
the US for the first time since 1976,]{.underline} in a role reversal
with potential political reverberations in both Beijing and Washington.
[The world's second-largest economy will grow just 2% this
year]{.underline}, Bloomberg Economics wrote in a report Thursday. [By
comparison, US gross domestic product will increase 2.8%]{.underline}
this year, Bloomberg Economics predicts. While [Beijing]{.underline} is
applying fiscal, monetary and regulatory [stimulus
measures]{.underline}, the impact is [being blunted by President Xi
Jinping's Covid Zero policy]{.underline}, which requires strict curbs on
activity when virus outbreaks occur. The US, while struggling to cope
with high inflation, is still being propelled by strong hiring and
consumer spending. The Bloomberg Economics call is on the bearish end of
the spectrum, with the median forecast for China's 2022 GDP growth still
over 4%. If they have it right, this year would be the first time that
China's full-year growth pace has lagged behind that of its rival since
1976, when China was emerging from the tumultuous decade of the Cultural
Revolution, World Bank data show. [Since the "reform and opening up"
campaign launched in the late 1970s, China has enjoyed faster expansion
rates]{.underline}, with plenty of scope still remaining for its
per-capita GDP to narrow the gap with the US. Catching Up [China\'s
per-capita GDP remains well below US]{.underline}, showcasing growth
potential President Joe [Biden]{.underline}, who is urging congressional
lawmakers to pass a package of legislation aimed at strengthening US
competitiveness against China, [would be sure to seize on such a
relative growth outcome]{.underline}. [He has framed his economic
agenda]{.underline} in part [around demonstrating]{.underline} whether
[democracies can stand up to Xi's authoritarian model]{.underline}. [The
stakes are even higher for Xi]{.underline}, who is widely expected to
secure a third term as Communist Party chief later this year in a
precedent-breaking move. [A 2% growth rate would be far below the
government's official growth target of about 5.5% this
year]{.underline}. Xi told officials to ensure China's growth outpaces
the US this year, the Wall Street Journal reported last month. [It would
mark the first time the nation significantly undershot the annual
goal]{.underline} since the practice of setting targets was adopted in
the late 1990s. The government didn't publish a target in 2020, when the
pandemic hit. [This year's goal of "around 5.5%," the lowest ever
set]{.underline}, was determined by Chinese leaders before the latest
spate of lockdowns in metropolises including Shanghai, which have
devastated domestic spending. Some economists now estimate China's GDP
contracted this quarter amid April declines in retail sales and
industrial production. [A 2% expansion also would be the weakest for
China since 1976]{.underline}, [undershooting even 2020]{.underline}
when the pandemic pulled GDP growth down to 2.2%. Back in the aftermath
of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, a much-smaller Chinese economy
expanded 3.9% in 1990. Politics may have played some part in the setting
of a target that already looked ambitious before the latest
pandemic-related measures, according to Stephen Jen, who runs hedge fund
and advisory firm Eurizon SLJ Capital. There are likely divisions over
the magnitude of regulatory moves against industries including property
and technology, in his analysis. "This is, we suspect, the main reason
behind the obviously aggressive growth target: it was intentionally
planted by the 'pro-growth' camp in Beijing to limit further
'crackdowns' and restore a better environment for the private sector to
thrive," Jen and colleague Joana Freire wrote in a note earlier this
month. Policy makers indeed have repeatedly rolled out pledges of more
growth-friendly measures. Vice Premier Liu He earlier this week hinted
that Beijing may be ready to let up on the clampdown on technology
firms. But [announcements have fallen short of any]{.underline}
specific, [large-scale fiscal package]{.underline} or decisive
across-the-board monetary easing, leaving economists and investors
unimpressed. "China still has policy options," Citigroup Inc. economists
Xiangrong Yu and Xiaowen Jin wrote in a note this week. "At this
juncture, a timely and decisive rollout of real stimulus measures is
really critical to bring growth back on track." One footnote to the GDP
rivalry: [Biden has already claimed credit for outpacing
China]{.underline}. "For the first time in 20 years, our economy grew
faster than China's," the president said in a statement on GDP data in
January. Measuring the fourth-quarter of last year compared with the
same period of 2020, the US expanded 5.5% against China's 4%. American
growth in the final three months of last year was accentuated by a jump
in inventories. It remains to be seen whether the US can outstrip China
on a calendar-year average basis

federal regulation, Tech Target, "China's AI regulations face technical
challenge,"
https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/news/252514781/Chinas-AI-regulations-face-technical-challenge//ZW\]

[China is one of the first countries to regulate AI algorithms \-- a
regulation that may prove technically difficult for businesses to adhere
to]{.underline}**.** China\'s AI algorithm regulations took effect March
1, requiring businesses to provide explainable AI algorithms and be
transparent about their purpose, such as for recommending products or
services. The new regulations also prohibit businesses reliant on AI
algorithms from offering different prices to different people based on
personal data collected. [Technical feasibility will be one of the most
challenging aspects facing the new regulations]{.underline}**, said
Russell Wald, director of policy for Stanford University\'s Institute
for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). Explainable AI has
proven to be difficult for businesses to offer up.** **In this Q&A, Wald
talks about the AI regulations\' impact on businesses, as well as how
they\'re unlikely to affect the Chinese government\'s own use of AI when
it comes to surveilling its citizens.** What do you think about China
taking this step? Wald: What I find most interesting is China has done
this first. We can see and watch in real time what happens to some of
these businesses now being regulated for the first time. Questions
remain about the technical feasibility of this. The question is, are we
seeing regulation in theory or regulation in practice? One key part is a
continuing need for human-centered AI. How do you define human-centered
AI? Wald: AI that is inspired by the human brain and comes from what
you\'ve seen in human development. AI that doesn\'t replace humans but
augments human capability. And the third part of that is AI that
doesn\'t harm but rather benefits humanity ... technology fostering
instead of eroding democratic aspects. That\'s the key part. It\'s a
recognition of the rights of everyone to be able to go in and look at
these technologies and have fair access to them and the rights to
challenge their governments when they\'re in use. How will requiring AI
algorithmic accountability and transparency impact businesses? Wald:
[There is the technical issue here of whether that\'s
feasible]{.underline}. [That\'s one layer that has a big question mark
hanging over it]{.underline}. Then there\'s the aspect of following
regulation where you could and being in compliance with that. To that
end, whether or not those companies will be able to do it, I think
they\'ll have to. I don\'t think they have a choice. The larger question
is not whether Chinese businesses are able to comply with this, it is
whether other international companies will now be affected by this. If
you\'re selling into the Chinese market, you are going to have to work
on that. That\'s where a unique tension is going to come through. [What
if China says, \'It is technically feasible\'? Then there will be other
countries that say \'No, it\'s actually not, we\'ve had these
problems]{.underline}.\' Will these regulations apply to the Chinese
government\'s use of AI? Wald: [The government will not
cede,]{.underline} from my view at least, [its surveillance of its
citizens]{.underline}. Because of that, I think it\'ll always have
access to that technology. It\'s too tempting. It even remains tempting
for local law enforcement in the U.S. But here, at least in the United
States, we\'re having a debate about an AI bill of rights. We\'re
debating about facial recognition use by police, by the federal
government at the border. There is this open debate. That debate is not
happening in this case of the \[Chinese\] government\'s use of it. Do
you think there needs to be more debate before moving forward with AI
regulations? Wald: The EU or U.S. system of open debate around this is
ultimately driving us in the right space. Not fast enough, but still a
better pathway forward. What I do have concerns about in [the U.S.
is]{.underline} we are [woefully behind]{.underline}. [You\'re starting
to see an increase in legislation]{.underline}. You\'re starting to see
a Federal Trade Commission that\'s trying to lean a little more forward
on some of this. But I think the best way to have these dialogues and
national debate is through legislation where all the interest groups,
all the advocacy organizations, everyone comes to the table and hashes
it out. Are there aspects of the Chinese legislation you\'ll be paying
attention to, like how they handle consumer complaints about potential
harms caused by AI algorithms? Wald: I mentioned that technical
feasibility part, that\'s really important. I\'m more curious about what
the petition process will be. I\'d like to watch that space more than
anything. Is it significant, is it public, are a lot of people openly
complaining? I would be curious to see the registration of these
complaints. That would be important for when Europe or the U.S. starts
to get into this model. What\'s the mechanism for them to be able to do
this? If we all had a contact at the FTC or the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, they\'d be flooded and overwhelmed and unable to
manage that process appropriately. The logistics of managing that has
huge application towards ultimate effectiveness. Editor\'s note:

**China led AI strangles innovation\-\--American standards are key.**

Arijit **Sengupta** 09-15-**21** \[Founder and CEO of Aible, Fast
Company, "China's new proposed law could strangle the development of
AI," https://www.fastcompany.com/90676516/china-ai-law-problems//ZW\]

[China's]{.underline} internet watchdog, the Cyberspace Administration
of China (CAC), recently issued a draft [proposal of
regulations]{.underline} to manage how technology companies use
algorithms when providing services to consumers. The proposed law
mandates that companies must use algorithms to "actively spread positive
energy." Under the proposal, companies must submit their algorithms to
the government for approval or risk being fined and having their service
terminated. This [is an incredibly bad and even dangerous
idea]{.underline}. [It's what happens when people who don't understand
AI try to regulate AI]{.underline}. [Instead of fostering innovation,
governments are looking at AI through their unique lenses of fear and
trying to reduce the harm they worry about most]{.underline}. Thus,
western regulators focus on fears such as violation of privacy, while
Chinese regulators are perfectly okay with collecting private data on
their citizens but are concerned about AI's ability to influence people
in ways deemed undesirable by the government. [If the Chinese law is
adopted, it will create a lengthy bureaucratic process that will likely
ensure that no small company or startup will survive or even enter the
market]{.underline}. [The moment you allow government regulators to be
the final arbiters of what emerging technologies can and cannot do,
you've strangled innovation]{.underline}. The only people who will
profit under such a law are large companies that can invest in
unproductive bureaucratic activities due to massive cash reserves and
bad actors because they'll ignore regulators and do whatever they want.
Cash-starved startups who wish to follow the law will be most
disadvantaged by this approach. China is not alone in taking
bureaucratic approaches to AI. In April, the European Union released a
draft Artificial Intelligence Act that would ban certain AI practices
outright and mandate that AI applications deemed "high risk" meet strict
data governance and risk management requirements. This includes
requirements on testing, training, and validating algorithms, ensuring
human oversight, and meeting standards of accuracy, robustness, and
cybersecurity. Businesses would need to prove that their AI systems
conform with these requirements before placing them on the European
market. Imposing algorithm requirements or requiring companies to
justify approaches can sound less onerous than the outright banning of
technologies. The reality is that in either case, startups do not have
the resources to participate in such bureaucratic slow processes.
Smaller companies will be forced out of the arena even though they are
most likely to create true innovations in this space. Imagine a world
where startups had to get patents on their technology before building
their software. Only about half of U.S. patents are approved, which is
not terrible, but it takes about two years for approval to come through.
[Algorithms are more difficult to examine than
patents]{.underline}---especially deep learning algorithms which very
few experts understand. Based on the lengthy timelines in the patent
office, [we can surmise that algorithm approval processes are likely to
take longer than two years]{.underline}. [This is simply not fast
enough]{.underline}: [Technology in a rapidly evolving space like AI
would already be outdated by the time it was approved]{.underline}. Any
approach that involves regulators preapproving algorithms would strangle
innovation in this space. There's another reason why such legislation
would be more onerous for small companies. For startups reliant on
venture capital investments, typical funding cycles are 18 months long,
which means that investors expect to see tangible results from the
investment in less than 18 months. Thus, current investment approaches
would not support waiting years to get algorithms approved before
launching a product. While some VCs may adopt a different investment
approach, similar to medical investments for example, many entrepreneurs
would simply turn away from AI and pursue other opportunities. [The U.S.
is in a unique position to get AI guidelines right]{.underline}. [While
China and the European Union outline ever-stricter guidelines banning
certain types of AI, the U.S. has an opportunity to establish ethical
guidelines without inhibiting innovation]{.underline}. The only
appropriate approach to regulating AI is one where we make our societal
goals clear from the start and hold companies liable if they violate
those goals. For example, we don't force every company to undergo
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) inspections before
being able to operate. However, labor safety expectations are enshrined
in law and violators are prosecuted. If companies find alternative
approaches to keeping their employees safe, they are not penalized as
long as the societal goals are achieved. Giving government regulators
the power to limit broad technology categories is not the approach that
built the internet or the smartphone. That's why [the U.S. should tackle
AI regulation by making our societal goals clear and giving
organizations flexibility in achieving such goals]{.underline}.

In September the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) announced a
three-year plan to regulate predictive algorithms, and Chinese companies
scrambled to comply with new regulations. News of the plan came on the
heels of two other stringent policies -- the Data Security Law (DSL) and
Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) -- which were passed earlier
this year and came into full effect in November. [China's push for data
security and algorithmic governance should be viewed as a new chapter in
the country's storied attempts to regulate the technology
sector]{.underline}. In all likelihood, [these moves will minimally
affect state security bureaus' data collection capabilities, but will
create steep compliance costs for internet companies that could hamper
the state's long-term development goals]{.underline}. The DSL is
designed to curtail invasive data collection by Chinese tech companies.
Specifically, it restricts the collection of data by Chinese companies
within and outside of China that may "harm the national security or
public interests of the PRC." Given the ambiguous nature of the law,
[many Chinese companies have erred on the side of
over-compliance]{.underline}, rather than risk facing exorbitant
penalties -- which range from \$1,000 to over \$150,000, and may result
in the suspension or revocation of a business' license. The PIPL imposes
even more day-to-day compliance costs on Chinese tech companies that
work with personal data. Under the law, Chinese companies are now
obligated to create cybersecurity teams, conduct training sessions, and
classify data according to the potential for national security threat.
[The sweeping regulatory framework consists of 74 articles, and it
applies to any company that handles individual Chinese citizens'
personal information]{.underline}. Taken collectively, [the DSL and PIPL
should be viewed as a new chapter in Beijing's push to regulate the
Chinese technology sector]{.underline}. [At first glance, the steep
limits they place on data collection stand at odds with Beijing's
long-standing ambition to become the world leader in AI by
2030]{.underline}. [But the laws' long-term effects will hinge on two
hotly debated questions]{.underline} about how China's national tech
champions interact with the state. The first question is [whether the
new regulations will actually apply to China's "national AI
champions]{.underline}," o[r whether the special relationship between
big tech and the state might exempt them]{.underline} from the most
onerous requirements. [On the one hand, the Communist Party under Xi
Jinping seems adamant about curtailing the massive power China's tech
companies have accumulated]{.underline} over the past decade, and is
using these data governance regulations to reassert control. For their
part, [investors]{.underline} do [expect China's internet titans to take
a hit]{.underline}. Immediately after the DSL was passed, the Hang Seng
Tech index measured a 2.5 percent decrease in China's largest internet
and e-commerce stocks, to include those of Tencent and Alibaba,
amounting to a loss equivalent to tens of billions of U.S. dollars. In
the same month, when China's most popular ride sharing app Didi Chuxing
filed for an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, Chinese regulators
yanked it from app stores, citing violations of DSL's data security
regulations. The company has since lost 30 percent of users and seen its
share value decline by more than 40 percent. On the other hand, however,
the Chinese government has historically relied on Chinese internet
giants Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent to aid in intelligence and police
work, by collecting and processing troves of information these companies
collect about Chinese netizens. Through Article 7 of China's National
Intelligence Law, Article 77 of the National Security Law, and Article
28 of the Cybersecurity Law, the government is able to deputize internet
companies to assist with intelligence gathering. The codependent
relationship between Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and Chinese security
services could imply [that China's AI champions are too big to
regulate]{.underline}. But if they are subject to the full force of the
DSL and PIPL, the second question is whether the limitations set out in
these laws will materially limit Chinese tech giants' ability to collect
and process data at scale. Neither the DSL nor PIPL constrains data
collection by China's state security apparatus -- only internet and data
companies. But it's not clear to what extent state security offices rely
on data collected data in-house or outsourced to these firms. [If public
security bureaus have immediate and unfiltered access to the collection
platforms operated by private companies]{.underline}, as has been
claimed about Huawei 5G platforms and Lenovo computers, then [the
government would have little incentive to spare Chinese AI companies
from stringent restrictions on data collection]{.underline}. But,
because of their special relationship with the state, it's possible that
China's internet companies will benefit from data collected and provided
by Chinese security services to continue their AI development. Under the
auspices of China's national security and cybersecurity laws, Chinese
businesses are compelled to work with the state's security apparatus.
Companies that handle data related to "national security" are further
required to allow the Ministry of State Security access to their
companies' servers. Even if Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent face data
collection limitations, they could theoretically continue to rely on
data provided by Chinese security services to fine-tune their AI
products. Although it's not clear how exactly China's large internet
companies may be affected by new regulations on data and algorithms, the
composition of China's private tech industry will be fundamentally
altered. [The DSL and PIPL]{.underline} will make it substantially
harder for existing businesses to continue operating with the same
degree of autonomy they had enjoyed in the past, and may [create steep
barriers for new players]{.underline} hoping to enter China's tech
market.

[Most of the visions for]{.underline} self-modifying and [self-improving
AI have been a bit scary]{.underline} or a bit shallow. [Much discussion
has occurred around the concept of the singularity]{.underline}, first
explained by Vernor Vinge^2^ and now a theme popularized by Ray
Kurzweil,^3^ among others (for example, see www.aleph.
so/Trans/Global/Singularity). Roughly, [the singularity is a point in
history when technology accelerates beyond human capacity to master
it]{.underline}. [With regard to AI, this could mean that computers
learn and communicate with one another faster than they can with humans.
At that point, they might not be willing to slow down or engage
further]{.underline}. In such a case, the machines would reach a kind of
escape velocity, enabling them to leave human culture behind. [I\'m
suggesting that we should actively seek to create the capabilities
underlying such a possibility]{.underline}, because **[the potential
gains are exponentially greater than what traditional puppetry can
produce]{.underline}**. But [this surely entails risks]{.underline}, as
readily suggested in most of the scary movies about rogue AI and robots
gone haywire. [We]{.underline} obviously [have limited insight
into]{.underline} both [the]{.underline} positive and [negative
capabilities of self-improving AI systems]{.underline}. Although [the
road will be somewhat long]{.underline}, we ought to consider ways to
identify and mitigate the risks before they afflict us. Fortunately,
[many people interested in the singularity and future visions of robots
have given these issues serious consideration]{.underline}. We\'ll want
to incorporate their ideas and related technologies into the new
creationism agenda. This will help [prevent predictable
problems]{.underline} and provide additional insurance against the
unforeseen. Although I consider these risks serious, I think [we can
de-emphasize or defer them a bit]{.underline}. [To get out of the
puppetry business will require a major shift in]{.underline} investment,
orientation, and [technology]{.underline}. By focusing mostly on the
required new capacities for model-based learning and improvements in
operational contexts, we put first things first. Like the master puppet
makers of the classic folktales, [AI engineers have built some marvelous
machines]{.underline}. These machines are surely valuable, but our
puppetry won\'t cross the chasm separating us from a world of
artificially intelligent creatures. To get there, we need a singularity
of artificial creationism, where we launch artificial beings that can
adapt, learn, and evolve. [We need to emphasize the development of
continuously self-improving systems that interact with and perform tasks
in the physical world]{.underline}. Creation of those systems will mark
a singularity in the punctuated evolution of artificial intelligence.

Yet, [AI is]{.underline} also [transforming economies and
societies]{.underline}, and [generating new security
challenges]{.underline}. Automation will lead to widespread
unemployment. The final realization of driverless cars, for example,
will put out of work millions of taxi, Uber, and long-haul truck
drivers. Populist movements in the West have been driven by those
disaffected by globalization and technology, and mass unemployment
caused by automation will further grow those ranks and provide new fuel
to grievance politics. Moreover, [some fear that autonomous weapons
systems will become "killer robots]{.underline}" that select and engage
targets [without human input]{.underline}, and could [eventually turn on
their creators, resulting in human extinction]{.underline}. The [other
technologies]{.underline} on this list similarly [balance great
potential upside with great downside risk]{.underline}. 3D printing, for
example, can be used to "make anything anywhere," reducing costs for a
wide range of manufactured goods and encouraging a return of local
manufacturing industries.61 At the same time, [advanced 3D printers can
also be used by revisionist and rogue states to print component parts
for]{.underline} advanced weapons systems or even [WMD programs,
spurring arms races and weapons proliferation]{.underline}.62 Genetic
engineering can wipe out entire classes of disease through improved
medicine, or wipe out entire classes of people through genetically
engineered superbugs. Directed-energy missile defenses may defend
against incoming missile attacks, while also undermining global
strategic stability. Perhaps [the greatest risk to global strategic
stability from new technology]{.underline}, however, [comes from the
risk that revisionist autocracies may win the new tech arms
race]{.underline}. [Throughout history, states that have
dominated]{.underline} the commanding heights of

power]{.underline}, [upsetting global strategic stability]{.underline},
and the call for a democratic-led, rules-based system outlined in these

to work with other major powers to develop a framework for harnessing
emerging technology in a way that maximizes its]{.underline} upside
[potential]{.underline}, [while mitigating against its downside

The Chinese AI advantage [Leading economies in the world understand the
importance of]{.underline} artificial intelligence ([AI]{.underline}) in
generating economic growth. China is no exception. In July 2017, the
Chinese State Council declared that AI was a top priority and created
the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan to catch up
with the West by 2020 and overtake it by 2025. Investment is not only
coming from the government. In April 2018, SenseTime Group Ltd, backed
by Alibaba, became the world's most valuable AI start/up, having raised
\$600 million. By 2030, it is predicted that AI will increase China's
GDP by 26.1%. In addition to massive investment, [China has]{.underline}
other distinct [characteristics that put it at an advantage in the
development of AI]{.underline}. With more than 700 million internet
users, China has a clear advantage in data volume that can be used to
train AI-learning algorithms. Its unique brand of socialist market
economy gives the government substantial control over market forces,
creating a closer cooperation between businesses and the government, and
giving Beijing economic leverage to expand its AI initiatives across
many industries. Additionally, China has relatively few privacy
protection laws, providing the government with extensive access to
consumer data, a key to AI development. [China's innovation talent gap
Despite heavy investment and easy access to data, however, we believe
**China will struggle to realize its AI ambitions**]{.underline}. [The
main obstacle for AI development]{.underline} in China [is]{.underline}
not lack of funding, but [lack of innovative talent]{.underline}. China
is not short on raw technical talent -- quite the opposite. The number
of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) graduates
has been particularly explosive as part of the government's push to
develop a technical workforce. In 2013, 40 percent of Chinese graduates
finished a degree in STEM, more than twice the U.S. average.
Nevertheless, we believe that [AI advancements will plateau as China
struggles with its lack of innovative talent]{.underline}. This
[limiting factor cannot be easily overcome by government
legislation]{.underline}, as it must be fostered through a culture of
entrepreneurship, something that the country is sorely missing. In
recent years, China has been importing its AI talent from overseas.
According to LinkedIn's Global AI Talent report published in July 2017,
44% of the overseas AI talent working in China comes from the US,
followed by the UK and France as the second and third source countries.
Roughly 90% of AI positions advertised in Mainland China go unfilled
unless companies offer them to overseas workers. The number of Chinese
AI job postings on LinkedIn surged from about 50,000 in 2014 to 440,000
in 2016, according to Wang Di, vice-president of LinkedIn China. China
ranked 40th and 31st out of 63 countries in the IMD World Talent Report
and Digital Competitiveness Report, respectively. [Educational
barriers]{.underline} The Chinese AI innovation chasm [Inhibiting
creativity starts in school]{.underline} and carries through higher
education. Jack Ma, founder of the Alibaba Group, [suggests that the
Chinese education system does not give students enough time to have fun,
explore and experiment]{.underline}. It is often in these moments that
great ideas are born. Chinese students, especially at university level,
are so consumed by academics that they rarely get an opportunity to
experiment with outside-the-classroom learning and growth. [A
study]{.underline} conducted by researchers from Kyungpook National
University in South Korea to analyze creativity in Chinese and Korean
universities [concluded that Chinese students at top-ranked institutions
were less creative than those at less prestigious
institutions]{.underline}. Once they enter the workforce, these
graduates struggle to step out of their disciplined and rigidly
structured environment. [As a consequence, they tend to produce
superficial, mechanical innovations that require little
imagination]{.underline}. Students who enter top Chinese universities,
through China's brutal Gaokao entrance exams, have their creativity
muted by a system that rewards rote memorization over original thinking.
[While China produces twice as many college graduates as the United
States, it fails to cultivate entrepreneurial and creative spirit in
these highly educated workers]{.underline}. Overcoming cultural barriers
[Culture also plays an important role]{.underline}. Whereas risk-taking
and entrepreneurship are woven into the fabric of many Western cultures,
the Chinese mentality is imbued with unity, obedience and reputation.
Both China's current communist system and its ancient culture have long
stressed the importance of social cohesion. Rather than prioritizing
their own interests, [people are encouraged to think
collectively]{.underline}, placing the majority over the individual. The
stress placed on saving face [means that people are scared to take
risks]{.underline} out of fear of damaging their social standing. These
powerful cultural norms are a threat to the development of
courageousness in innovation, which is a necessary condition for
creating new ideas. Moreover, Confucianism highlights the importance of
showing obedience to superiors. Thus, workers will often blindly follow
their leaders without question. These cultural factors thus become a
limitation to what Chinese companies can produce qualitatively. It
cannot help that, [because of government censorship, AI researchers in
China do not have access to key research tools]{.underline}, like
Google. Chinese digital giants, like Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu, have
compensated for these cultural barriers with speed and agility. Frequent
tiny, incremental changes can add up to large innovations over time.
Tencent's WeChat started out as a direct copy of WhatsApp, but through
thousands of rounds of iterative improvement, it has become something
much more impressive. However, AI is unchartered territory, and
innovations tend to be less linear than for apps, games, and
marketplaces. It is unlikely that Chinese giants can use fast,
incremental approaches to compensate for a lack of AI innovation.
Crossing the AI Innovation Chasm China has the potential to become the
preeminent global superpower in AI innovation. Money and other resources
are available and its people have boundless intellectual capacity. [At
the moment]{.underline}, however, [the cultural climate with respect to
innovation is very restrictive]{.underline}. By fostering creativity
from an early age, and reducing structural barriers, China's model for
AI development would become more sustainable. Heavy R&D investment will
boost the economy for a while, but [a continued lack of innovative
talent may leave it at standstill]{.underline}.

how artificial intelligence will change how we think about jobs; Telsa

posed by artificial intelligence; and Bill Gates also expressed his
concern about super-intelligent machines. [However]{.underline}, Murray
Campbell, IBM research scientist and senior manager, says that [fears
over the progression of artificial intelligence have become
\"overblown]{.underline}.\" He also noted that [there are plenty of
benefits that humans could gain from having super advanced artificial
intelligence]{.underline}. \"[Because the benefits are so
huge]{.underline}, that if we don\'t use AI technologies [we\'re going
to be losing out on all of these beneficial effects in health care, in
self-driving cars, in education]{.underline},\" Campbell told Time. The
scientist also added that workers and employees who have artificial
intelligence as their work assistant can become more effective and
efficient with their jobs. Clarifying the uses of artificial

advanced artificial intelligence? Campbell explained that [new
technology always takes away human jobs but creates new opportunities as
well]{.underline}. He added that [the biggest danger is not following up
on advancing artificial intelligence because humans could really lose
out on all of the benefits of this new technology]{.underline}. However,
there are many aspects of artificial intelligence that scientists and
researchers need to figure out better. \"I think [it\'s worthwhile to
think about these research questions around AI and ethics, and AI and
safety]{.underline},\" Campbell explained. Because of the increase in
interest regarding artificial intelligence, the White House has
announced four public workshops about the technology. These workshops
will focus on the potential pros and cons of using advanced artificial
intelligence, Fortune reports.

[The global competition between the United States and China continues
apace]{.underline}. [Technology is rightly seen as providing unique
leverage]{.underline} to win this geopolitical race. [The U.S. long has
been the global technology powerhouse]{.underline}, [but]{.underline}
not surprisingly, [we have heard much about the Chinese government's
ambition to dominate high-tech industries]{.underline} such as 5G
telecommunications, autonomous vehicles, blockchain, and semiconductor
chips. In this light, as a horizontal technology that can be applied
across all sectors, artificial intelligence ([AI]{.underline}) [has
become a strategic priority]{.underline} and the [Chinese focus on
superiority in this field is touted as something about which the U.S.
should be concerned]{.underline}. S[ome have gone so far as to conclude
that the West has already lost the AI race]{.underline}. [Don't believe
the hype]{.underline}. To be sure, the availability of large amounts of
data is at the heart of AI success. It is tempting to think that
less-democratic regimes that amass huge amounts of data about their
citizens and have scant regard for privacy can develop better AI systems
using that data. However, all other things being equal, better and
[higher quality AI systems emerge from countries with strong data
privacy and data protection regulations because AI systems must undergo
greater scrutiny during their development and deployment]{.underline}.
An example of this can be seen in the United States regarding fair
lending practices and consumer protection from credit bureaus. Further,
the market for AI is global, and such high-quality AI systems find
buyers in other countries as well. [Around the globe, Big Tech's rising
power has resulted in calls for more oversight]{.underline}. In a
drastic move that stunned the industry and analysts alike, [the Chinese
government recently rewrote the rulebook for the country's technology
industry]{.underline}. In effect[, China is vacating entire swaths of
digital and creative industries]{.underline}, arenas that serve as
training grounds and talent factories for other industries. [This more
restrictive approach may not bode well for China's AI]{.underline}
industry [in the long term]{.underline}. [China may find itself
constrained on the extent of automation and AI in its manufacturing
sector]{.underline} --- labor-intensive manufacturing remains China's
main strength, and a high degree of automation can result in job losses,
labor unrest, and instability. Meanwhile, [there is bipartisan support
for AI in the United States]{.underline}. Former President Trump
proposed increasing funding for AI development through the National
Science Foundation. The National AI Initiative Act of 2020 signaled a
sense of urgency and suggested that several federal agencies create a
national strategy on artificial intelligence. The Biden administration
has formed the Artificial Intelligence Research Resource Task Force to
develop a roadmap to foment AI research and spark innovation nationwide.
There is draft legislation, at both the state and federal level, to
promote responsible use of AI and prevent its misuse. Strong objections
to the use of facial recognition and other AI systems by law enforcement
in the U.S., raised by civil liberties advocates, have led some local
authorities, such as the City of San Francisco, to ban such systems. To
use a Silicon Valley phrase, these [debates]{.underline} are "not a bug,
but a feature." They shine a light on the limitations [of AI
systems]{.underline} and help to set the "rules of the road" for proper
use of AI. This **[will establish the U.S. as a global leader in AI
regulation]{.underline}**, once lawmakers and regulators do their work.
[China, meanwhile, has faced strong global criticism]{.underline} for
using facial recognition software to monitor and surveil Uyghurs in its
Xinjiang region. [China has outlined a set of AI ethics principles, but
the jury is still out on enforcement and how they function in
practice]{.underline}. [The increasing number of AI research papers and
patents by Chinese researchers is often cited as proof that China has
caught up with the United States]{.underline} in this field. The
increased focus is good for the Chinese AI ecosystem, and it will help
them solve China-specific problems. [But dominance in this emerging
strategic industry is not guaranteed]{.underline}. [The U.S. has several
strategic advantages]{.underline}, including: the strengths of its
[higher education and research institutes]{.underline}, which attract
the best STEM talent from across the world; [the largest venture capital
ecosystem]{.underline}; [and the largest number of technology
unicorns]{.underline} (start-ups with private valuations greater than
\$1 billion). [China is not overtaking the U.S. in artificial
intelligence]{.underline}. The current evidence and trajectory paint a
clear picture: [The conditions for AI to flourish]{.underline}, such as
incentives to experiment, freedom to pursue opportunities without
restrictions, and the coming guardrails to prevent misuse, [favor U.S.
leadership]{.underline}. This is still the United States's game to lose
--- though maybe both countries could win through collaboration. To
solve planet-scale problems such as climate change, we are going to need
AI solutions from both competitors.

**The risk of great power war is high -- it could cause nuclear
escalation**

Having reconstituted its military power, [[Russia has been reasserting
its dominance along its Central Asian and Eastern European
peripheries]{.underline}, [challenging NATO and undermining the
E]{.underline}]{.mark}uropean [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nion, [and
projecting [its military power deep into the Middle
East]{.mark}]{.underline} \-- all in addition to seeking to weaken and
divide the U.S. through information warfare and other means.

Riding an economic and military rise unprecedented in modern history,
[[China has been seeking to re-establish]{.underline}]{.mark} its former
[mastery in [the Asia-Pacific]{.mark}]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
perhaps eventually [[compete with the U.S. on a global]{.mark}
[scale]{.mark}]{.underline} as well. All this is normal enough; it is
the warp and woof of great-power rivalry. Yet it has uniquely dangerous
implications for the U.S. and the international system it leads.

[As relations between the [major powers become more rivalrous, it
becomes harder to achieve cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} on matters
that require multilateral action. Since 2011, for instance, U.S.-Russian
rivalry has continually frustrated international efforts to bring the
Syrian civil war to an end. As Russia and China assert their influence,
they are also increasingly contesting the global rules of road \--
freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, the illegitimacy of
altering borders by force \-- that have underpinned international peace
and prosperity for generations.

Likewise, [the return of great-power rivalry raises the possibility that
a hostile power might come to exert dominant influence]{.underline} in
one of the key regions of the world \-- a nightmare of U.S. strategists
reaching back roughly a century. Finally, [this competition is a
potential pathway to]{.underline} the most [cataclysmic]{.underline}
phenomenon that can afflict the international environment: [war between
the major powers.]{.underline}

[These dangers are not]{.underline} as [far-fetched]{.underline} as they
may seem. [In East Asia, China has used maritime coercion to sprint
toward a position of dominance in the South China and East China
Seas]{.underline}, while also shifting the regional military balance
through a two-decade buildup meant to keep the U.S. from projecting
power into the Western Pacific.

[Russia has demonstrated that it will use force to keep states like
Georgia and Ukraine from tilting too far toward the West]{.underline},
and Moscow's military buildup has given it a pronounced local advantage
on NATO's exposed eastern flank.

Indeed, [the prospect of great-power war is becoming steadily less
remote. Chinese strategists are reportedly preparing for a "short, sharp
war" with the U.S.]{.underline} and its East Asian allies, [and Russian
doctrine now reportedly emphasizes the]{.underline} limited [use of
nuclear weapons to achieve "escalation dominance]{.underline}" in a
conflict. And as the intensity of great-power competition rises, the
Trump administration is largely fumbling the American response.

**[2ac/1ar \-\-- China Leadership Fails]{.underline}**

**Chinese leadership fails -- the US is successful**

**Zhao, 18** -- Suisheng Zhao is professor and director of the Center
for China-US Cooperation at Josef Korbel School of International
Studies, University of Denver ("A Revisionist Stakeholder: China and the
Post-World War II World Order" Journal of Contemporary China, DOI:
10.1080/10670564.2018.1458029

But China is not ready. First, as one Chinese scholar admitted, '[China
does not have the comprehensive national strength to change the current
global order]{.underline} led by the US and other Western countries for
more than 70 years'.41 [A fragile rising power much weaker than most
outsiders think, China is a middle-income country, facing immense
internal hurdles, such as the environmental destruction, rampant
corruption, inequality, and huge local government deb]{.underline}t, all
of which have the potential to derail its rise. Preoccupied by mounting
challenges, [Chinese leaders have to fight an uphill battle to mobilize
resources and internal support for the global leadership
role]{.underline}. China is far from achieving the donor status of many
OECD countries. For one prominent Chinese scholar, the most dangerous
challenge is the extreme-leftist policy-line and 'the false-large-empty'
(假大空) slogans, making international promises and setting strategic
objectives beyond the reach of China's national strength.42 China's
international initiatives do not play a critical role in China's rise
but are the consequences of its rise.

Although some scholars have claimed that the US power was declining so
that the post-World War II order was suffering from an acute case of
Anno Domini, they may have to recant their predictions. [With the
world's largest concentration of capital and technology, the US remains
the most powerful nation.]{.underline} China has faster GDP growth than
the US, but its net national wealth, i.e. the resources available to
pursue national interests, is still not in America's league. From
2000--2012, Chinese net wealth jumped from \$4.66 trillion to \$21.7
trillion. American net wealth over the same period rose from \$42.3
trillion to \$67.5 trillion. From 2012 to 2017, while Chinese net wealth
climbed to \$29 trillion, American net wealth reached to over \$93
trillion. [Claiming that China is about to eclipse the US is untenable
in the face of \$64 trillion less in net wealth]{.underline}. The
resource advantage rests overwhelmingly with the US.43

China has pushed RMB internationalization. But the share of RMB in
global payment is below 2% while US dollar share remains above 40%. RMB
accounts for a scant 1% of global reserves while the US dollar accounts
for over 60%. The drive to internationalize RMB has not gained momentum
since its inclusion in the SDR basket in 2015.44 Shortly before
inclusion, China's Central Bank announced a 'market-oriented' mechanism
for setting the daily benchmark of the exchange rate, accompanied by 2%
devaluation, the first since 1994, leading the onshore RMB to tumble by
4% in the subsequent two days. The Central bank intervened massively to
halt the slide in the weeks after. Less than two months after RMB's
inclusion in the IMF basket, the central bank imposed new controls over
capital outflow.45 These difficulties have made the cost outweigh the
benefits of RMB internationalization.

Remaining the 'indispensable nation' of the world, the US cannot avoid
the responsibility to provide public goods and security protection for
its allies. [Although]{.underline} President [Trump has]{.underline}
distanced Washington from its traditional allies and [stepped back from
global leadership, the American economy and geopolitics encourage a
global outlook, imposing compelling imperatives]{.underline} on the
superpower. Woven thickly into global value chains, protectionism calls
for other countries' retaliation against American producers and shifts
burdens to American consumers. [With checks and balances in the US
constitution]{.underline} and the dynamism of the open society,
[economic liberals and internationalists in the US
Government]{.underline} and across the states [have been powerful
countervailing forces against protectionism and
disengagement]{.underline}. In spite of President Trump's isolationist
position, 'American national interests endure. They include preventing
any hostile power from dominating Asia, Europe, or the energy resources
of the Middle East; sustaining an open international economic and
political order, not subverted by spheres of influence that exclude the
United States; protecting free access to the global commons, especially
the maritime sea lanes that carry 90 % of global trade; nurturing
alliances that magnify American power and influence; and promoting
democracy and human rights, because the ultimate source of global
security is a world in which power is bounded by law and pluralistic
institutions'.46

Second, China cannot provide shared values and other elements of soft
power to commons willingness on the part of other countries to align,
and in some cases subordinate, their own narrow interests to those of
the larger international community. China has made significant
investments in developing its soft power with the opening of more than
500 Confucius Institutes across the world and carrying out extensive
international branding campaigns. But China is not successful in
projecting its values and ideals that others identify with and aspire to
share. The US leadership comes with willing followers and trust through
a network of alliances and other ties. For all of their differences with
Washington and periodic resentment of its policies, many countries
invested more confidence in the US than in any other nation. [China does
not possess the attributes that underpin US leadership. It lacks allies
and inspires little trust in its own neighborhood. Its efforts to
project soft power often fail to resonate]{.underline} abroad partly
because China displays little empathy with the sensitivities of those
living beyond its borders.47

[While US global influence has dropped]{.underline} due to President
Trump's policy, [it still holds much more soft power than
China]{.underline}. Against the background of seemingly retreating
democracy, China's authoritarianism appears to be more appealing to
autocracies. But this has not been accompanied by serious and
significant interest worldwide in China's development model. Promoting
globalization, the Chinese Government is doing the opposite by imposing
controls on the inflow of information and outflow of capital, leading
people to question the sincerity of its posited global leadership.

A Chinese scholar admits that China might one day overtake the US in the
size of economy but may never overtake the US influence and leadership
in the world.48 Another Chinese scholar finds that China is short of
international discursive power (国际话语权缺失). China had never played
a world leadership role in history. The traditional Chinese system
(华夏体系) was only an East Asian system, not universal, and cannot
automatically transform into modern discursive power.49 Until China
develops values that appeal universally, it misses one of the core
features of global leadership.

**China's overreliance on economic power prevents it from effectively
[exercising]{.underline} leadership**

**Zhao, 18** -- Suisheng Zhao is professor and director of the Center
for China-US Cooperation at Josef Korbel School of International
Studies, University of Denver ("A Revisionist Stakeholder: China and the
Post-World War II World Order" Journal of Contemporary China, DOI:
10.1080/10670564.2018.1458029

[Beijing's overreliance on its economic prowess as the key diplomatic
instrument reveals the shortage of normative power]{.underline}. Despite
its growing economic and military might, [China's efforts to use
economic ties to influence other state's behavior have only achieved
limited success because money cannot buy loyalty.]{.underline} Influence
does not simply derive from a country's coffers. While [closer economic
ties are]{.underline} important, they are [hardly sufficient to build
strong trust between countries]{.underline}---especially those with
conflicting security interests. This is clearly reflected in China's
relationship with Japan, characterized as hot economics and cold
politics. it is reflected in China's relations with North Korea, a
country that is widely perceived as economically dependent on China for
its own survival but has often taken actions against China's strategic
interests. To play a global leadership role, China has to build the
ability to inspire other countries to share its vision. The [leadership
will not work itself out only through economic ties]{.underline}.
Building common identity and value is equally, if not more, important.

Unable to construct shared values, [China may change nothing of
substance]{.underline} in the global order. While China's insistence on
the Westphalian principles looks attractive to some countries where
intense interventionism by the US often ends in chaos and chronic
instability, many of China's neighbors view China's great power
aspiration with a wary eye, worrying that, as Chinese power rises,
China's imperial past can produce an undue pressure on its leaders to
restore the old Chinese hierarchical order. One reporter took note that
at the 60th anniversary of the Bandung Conference that gave birth to the
Five-Principles, only two notable leaders turned up. One was President
Xi, who used the occasion to portray China as the leader of the
non-western world. The other was Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who
suggested that the threat to the sovereignty of smaller countries no
longer came from the West.50

[China's power aspirations in a diverse and crowded neighborhood are
checked by the presence and influence of the US and other regional
powers.]{.underline} The Twenty-first century has seen a multipolarity
rather than a Chinese hegemony. [While China is rising, many surrounding
states are also on the rise.]{.underline} [China's shift from espousing
a peaceful rise to assertive behavior has made its neighbors nervous,
motivating them to realign with the US]{.underline} and with each other
to balance China.51 A May 2017 ASEAN survey found that more than 73 % of
correspondents had little or no confidence that Beijing would do the
right thing in contributing to global peace, security, and governance.52
A regional Pax Sinica is not desirable for these countries.
Historically, to bandwagon with a rising power is common practice due to
potentially great relative gains. The most successful rising powers most
often attracted the greatest number of bandwagoners.53 It does not serve
China's interests to have tension with many neighbors simultaneously.
China cannot rise successfully without winning the support of its
neighbors or at least preempt their balancing motives.

**Chinese leadership fails and can't replace the US**

**Beeson, 17** - Professor of International Politics at Murdoch
University in Perth, Western Australia (Mark, "Why Has Leadership in the
Asia--Pacific Proved So Elusive?" Chin. Polit. Sci. Rev. (2017)
2:567--581 https://doi.org/10.1007/s41111-017-0074-y

Paradoxically enough, however, in the aftermath of the election of
Donald Trump, [China has emerged as]{.underline} an unexpected [champion
of 'globalization']{.underline}. In part, this reflects a recognition on
the part of China's leaders that the country has been one of the
principal beneficiaries of an open international economic order. At the
same time, however, Xi (2017) in particular clearly sees an opportunity
for China to reposition itself as precisely the sort of 'responsible
stakeholder' that some have long called for (Zoellick 2005). At a time
when the Trump administration seems to be abandoning the traditional
American role in favor of a more instrumental, nationalistic approach to
trade and even security policy (Browne 2017; Hodge 2017), Chinese
officials have been quick to seize the moment and the initiative.

[There are, however, continuing constraints]{.underline} confronting
China [that raise real questions about its ability to offer]{.underline}
a l[eadership]{.underline} at the regional, much less the global level.
First, the extant international order will not be easily replaced, nor
will America's role within it. The fact remains that [the US is still
the world's preeminent economic and military power]{.underline}, albeit
one with diminished status and damaged authority. Second, [China has
shown little desire or capacity to articulate an alternative vision for
the international system]{.underline}, thus far, [and seems willing to
work within existing institutional architecture]{.underline} [and
**avoid the costs associated with leadership**]{.underline} (Wang and
French 2014). Third, [leaders need followers, and]{.underline} at this
stage---despite an apparently growing diplomatic influence in Southeast
Asia---[it has few allies and frien]{.underline}ds. Indeed, the fourth
point to make is that [China's continuing pursuit of its own
nationalistic goals, especially its claims in the South China Sea
dispute, look certain to **make its future relations and role divisive
and contentious**]{.underline}.

**No other power can replace the US -- retrenchment guarantees global
conflict**

**Haass, 17** -- president of the Council on Foreign Relations (Richard,
"America and the Great Abdication" The Atlantic, 12/28,
http://www.washingtonspeakers.com/images/pdfs/America%20and%20the%20Great%20Abdication%20-%20The%20Atlantic.pdf

[An optimist would]{.underline} also [hope that other countries would
pick up where the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [left off in
promoting international order]{.underline}. The fact is, though, that
[there is no alternative great power willing and able to step
in]{.underline} and assume what has been the U.S. role. [China is often
suggested, but its leadership is focused mostly on consolidating
domestic order and maintaining artificially high rates of economic
growth, lest there be popular unrest]{.underline}. [China's interest in
regional and global institutions]{.underline} (including both its
regional trade mechanism and its "One Belt, One Road" infrastructure
initiative) [seems more designed to bolster its economy and influence
than to help set rules and arrangements that would be broadly
beneficial]{.underline}. [China's assertiveness in the South China
Sea]{.underline} (including its rejection of an international legal
ruling challenging its claims) [and its unwillingness to do all it could
to rein in North Korea casts further doubts as to its readiness to fill
the shoes of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.

[There is no other candidate. Russia]{.underline} under Vladimir Putin
[is a country with a narrowly based economy that is focused on retaining
power at home,]{.underline} reestablishing Russian influence in the
Middle East and Europe, and interfering in the internal politics of
Western democracies. It is mostly a spoiler prepared to use those
instruments of power it possesses (military, energy, and cyber) to
advance its aims. [India is preoccupied with the challenge of economic
development]{.underline} and is tied down by its problematic
relationship with Pakistan. [Japan is held back by its declining
population, domestic constraints, and the suspicions of its neighbors.
Europe is limited in what it can do by a lack of defense
capability]{.underline}, and is distracted by questions revolving around
the relationship between member states and the EU. [The cold truth is
that the alternative to a U.S.--led international order is less
international order]{.underline}.

[All this comes at a time challenges to order are many, including a
China that is trying to extend its writ over the South China Sea and a
North Korea that appears intent on developing the ability to place
nuclear warheads on ballistic missiles]{.underline} capable of reaching
not just its neighbors but across the world and an Iran with an imperial
vision of its position in the Middle East. [The Middle East is a region
of multiple conflicts of every sort]{.underline}---civil, regional,
proxy, and global---involving state and nonstate actors, as well as a
mixture of strong, weak, and failed states[. There is as well the
continuing Russian occupation of Crimea and its destabilization of
eastern Ukraine]{.underline}, the undermining of democracy and economic
deterioration of Venezuela, and any number of governance failures in
Africa, most starkly in South Sudan. There has been a marked
deterioration in U.S. relations with Russia, the result not just of its
military actions in Ukraine and Syria but also of its interference in
the 2016 U.S. presidential election. And [at the global level there is
the continuing gap between challenges and collective
responses,]{.underline} none more pronounced than in the domain of
cyberspace.

**[2ac/1ar \-\-- Deterrence Works]{.underline}**

**The perception of [resolve]{.underline} is a greater predictor of how
war starts than any other factor -- China prioritizes it over
capabilities**

**Mastro 15**-an assistant professor of security studies at the Edmund
A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, "Why
Chinese Assertiveness is Here to Stay", The Washington Quarterly, 21 Jan

These efforts are commendable---the United States rightly works to
preserve its military superiority and retain its ability to project
power in the region. During the Cold War, when the greatest pacing
threats were land conflicts, forward deploying U.S. forces in Europe and
Asia were sufficient to demonstrate the credibility of the U.S.
commitment to peace in those regions. But [[China is]{.mark} currently
[testing the waters]{.mark} not [because its leaders are]{.mark}
uncertain about the balance of power, but because they are [probing the
balance of ***resolve***]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This means that
staying ahead in terms of military might is insufficient in contemporary
East Asia.

China's strategists are betting that the side with the strongest
military does not necessarily win the war---the foundation of the
deterrent pillar of its A2/AD strategy. Indeed, China's experience in
fighting the Korean War proves that a country willing to sacrifice blood
and treasure can overcome a technologically superior opponent. [[The
belief that]{.mark} balance of [resolve drives outcomes more]{.mark} so
[than]{.mark} the balance of [power is the foundation of
China's]{.mark}]{.underline} new, more [[assertive
strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}; but U.S. responses to date have failed to
account for it. Canned demonstrations of U.S. power fail to address the
fundamental uncertainty concerning U.S. willingness, not ability, to
fight.

[[The U.S. focus on de-escalation]{.underline}]{.mark} in all situations
[only **[exacerbates this]{.mark}** issue]{.underline}. The Cold War
experience solidified the Western narrative stemming from World War I
that inadvertent escalation causes major war, and therefore crisis
management is the key to maintaining peace.74 This has created a
situation in which [the main U.S. goal has been de-escalation in each
crisis]{.underline} or incident [with Beijing. But [Chinese
leaders]{.mark} do not share this mindset---they [believe leaders
deliberately control the escalation process]{.mark} and therefore wars
happen because leaders decide at a given juncture that the best option
is to fight]{.underline}.75 [China is masterful at chipping away at U.S.
credibility through advancing militarization and coercive diplomacy. It
often uses limited military action to credibly signal its willingness to
escalate if its demands are not met]{.underline}. Strategist Thomas
Schelling theoretically captured this approach when he wrote it is "the
sheer inability to predict the consequences of our actions and to keep
things under control ... that can intimidate the enemy."76

[Because China introduces risk for exactly this reason, [the U.S. focus
on deescalation]{.mark} through crisis management is unlikely to produce
any change in Chinese behavior---if anything it [will only **encourage
greater provocations**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Beijing has identified
the U.S. fear]{.mark} of inadvertent [escalation, and is exploiting it
to compel the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[to give in to its demands]{.mark} and preferences]{.underline}. In
this way, [[the U.S. focus on de-escalation **may actually be the source
of instability** by rewarding]{.mark} [and encouraging further Chinese
provocations]{.mark}]{.underline}. [To signal to China that the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will not opt out of a
conflict, [Washington must **signal willingness to escalate**]{.mark} to
higher levels of conflict [when China is]{.mark} directly and purposely
[testing U.S. resolve]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [This may include
**reducing channels of communication during a
conflict**]{.underline},]{.mark} or involving additional regional
actors, to credibly demonstrate that China will not be able to use
asymmetry of resolve to its advantage.

The current mindset---that crisis management is the answer in all
scenarios--- will be difficult to dislodge, given the tendency among
U.S. military ranks to focus on worst-case "great battle" scenarios.
While realistic in Cold War operational planning, [decision makers
should consider instead the less violent and prolonged engagements that
characterize Chinese coercive diplomacy when evaluating risk and
reward]{.underline}, such as the 1962 Sino--Indian War or the 1974
Battle of the Paracel Islands. [[The idea that any conflict with China
would escalate to a major war]{.mark}, destroy the global economy, and
perhaps even escalate to a nuclear exchange [has no foundation in

[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[to concede in even the smallest
encounters]{.underline}]{.mark}. [While the Chinese leadership has
proven to be more risk-acceptant than the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates (or perhaps more accurately, to assess the risks to
be less than those perceived by U.S. strategists), **[[Xi still wants to

November 2014 keynote address at the Central Foreign Affairs Work
Conference, he noted that China remains in a period of strategic
opportunity in which efforts should be made to maintain the benign
strategic environment so as to focus on internal development.77

Ultimately, the U.S. regional objective must be peace and stability at
an acceptable cost. Given this, it is critical to understand the four
components of China's A2/AD strategy, the strategic foundation for
China's recent assertiveness, and how best to maintain the U.S. position
as a Pacific power. In addition to regularly attending meetings in the
region and developing new technology, new platforms, and new operational
concepts designed to defeat China's A2/AD strategy, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [needs to]{.underline} break
free of its Cold War-based paradigm paralysis and [rethink conceptions
of limited war, escalation, and risk]{.underline}.

Scolding China and imposing symbolic costs for each maritime incident is
unlikely to inspire the corrective change U.S. thinkers are hoping for.
[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[needs
to]{.mark} fundamentally change its approach by **[accept]{.mark}ing
[higher risk]{.mark}** [and **allowing for the possibility of
escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline}---both vertically in force as well as
horizontally to include other countries. This admittedly is a difficult
balance, especially given the need to avoid emboldening U.S. allies to
take actions that run contrary to U.S. interests. But [only
by]{.underline} mastering these two balancing acts---focusing on
balancing resolve, rather than forces, and [prioritizing stability over
crisis management---will the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[be able to maintain peace and stability in East Asia]{.underline}
without sacrificing U.S. or allied interests.

**[2ac/1ar \-\-- No Mindset Shift]{.underline}**

**Ceding to China destroys US influence AND no mindset shift --
policymakers are [locked in]{.underline}**

School of Government and Public Service (Christopher, "The US--Chinese
power shift and the end of the Pax Americana," 2018,

Accessed 6-30-22, LASA-AH)

The lock-in strategy also assumes that if the Pax Americana's
institutions are reformed, Beijing (and other non-western emerging
powers) will find it more attractive to remain in the post-1945
international order than to overturn it. [That assumption, however, is
logically flawed: achieving lock-in by reforming the existing
international order presumes that the United States can have its cake
(preserving the Pax Americana) and eat it too (reforming the current
international system's legacy institutions). But, as we all know, **when
the cake is eaten, it's gone.** [Reform]{.mark}]{.underline}---at least,
any kind of reform that would appeal to China---[would [mean the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates **[yield]{.mark}ing significant [power
]{.mark}**[in international]{.mark} [institutions]{.mark} to accommodate
Beijing.]{.underline} However, [[doing so would reduce US ability to
shape outcomes]{.mark}, [diminish Washington]{.mark}'s voice [in
international]{.mark} [institutions]{.mark}, and [impose constraints on
US autonomy in foreign and domestic policy]{.mark}]{.underline}.79 As
University of Birmingham lecturer Sevasti-Eleni Vezirgiannidou observes
with respect to insti- tutional reform: '[It is [questionable
whether]{.mark} [this will]{.mark} really [preserve US influence]{.mark}
[or]{.mark} rather, on the contrary, **[diminish it]{.mark},** as the
United States will have to share power in a reformed order and thus will
be restricted in its ability to act unilaterally]{.underline}.'80 The US
foreign policy establishment may talk the talk of reforming the interna-
tional order (and the institutions that underpin it), but [it is
[doubtful it will]{.mark} walk the walk with respect to [reform]{.mark},
[because that **would mean**]{.mark} **[accepting a downsized American
role]{.mark} in international politics**.]{.underline} On the contrary,
Washington's opposition to the AIIB indicates that the United States is
not prepared to see its influence in the international order diminished.
And, with respect to reforming the post-1945 international order to
accommodate the reality of a risen China, this is the nub of the
problem: instead of preserving the Pax Americana, reform would lead to
changes in the international order that would undermine it. Of course,
[regardless of whether there is institutional reform, the coming decades
are likely to witness major changes in the international order
irrespective of America's preferences.]{.underline}

6.1 Model Case 1: [Island building in the South China Sea as a form of
Coercive hegemony]{.underline} [China continued to pursue through 2018
an aggressive strategy to expand and maintain a foothold in the South
China Sea. It claimed rocks, islets, and archipelagos in this body of
water to enlarge its maritime territory and reach deep into Southeast
Asia, close to the Malacca Strait]{.underline}. China achieved this
objective at the expense of several Southeast Asian states who also
claim jurisprudence in this area. These are Vietnam, the Philippines,
Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan. These states\' claims clash with China\'s
in the area that the Chinese refer to as the "Nine-Dash-Line." China
bases its territorial claim on historical maps, albeit they are not
entirely conclusive. A 2016 verdict by an International Tribunal based
in The Hague ruled negatively against China: In a case where the
Philippines filed a complaint against Chinese conduct disregarding its
maritime borders, the verdict ruled against China and in favour of the
Philippines. China, of course, ignored and disavowed the ruling, as well
as making clear that the tribunal did not have jurisdiction over the
matter (Phillips, Holmes, & Bowcott, 2016). [China has gone beyond
publicly announcing its territorial claim. Instead, it has actively
started to produce real and tangible facts by engaging in the process of
"island building."]{.underline} The construction process begins by China
taking an islet, which sometimes is not larger than a rock, and
transferring building materials via ship to create helipads, harbours,
and airstrips. [Some have compared these artificial islands with sort of
China\'s stationary aircraft carriers. China wants to send a loud and
clear signal to regional neighbours and the rest of the world,
particularly to other great powers. It wants to **underscore its
maritime territorial claims**, with absolute and full vigour and
unwavering resolve]{.underline}. Hence, rather than leaving unperturbed
uninhabited and partially submerged islands, rocks, and islets, without
any physical signs of territorial claim and sovereignty, China builds
this new-aged military bases. These are all projections of China\'s
geostrategic reach. [China\'s fortification drive and island-building
program in the South China Sea is consistent with revisionist and
coercive policies]{.underline}. It deliberately revises borders. This
trend is [reminiscent of the violent rising by other great powers in
history. France, Germany, and Imperial Japan]{.underline} in the 18th
and 20th centuries, respectively, pursued such territorial expansion and
aggressive practice. [This aggressive territorial expansion constitutes
the type of evidence that many analysts will cease on to conclude that
**China is on a collision course with other great powers and
neighbours**]{.underline}. The policy will lead to diplomatic and
possibly military conflict over these territories. In this sense, it
will be [a harbinger of China\'s violent rise.]{.underline}

6.2 Model Case 2: The emerging Sino-Russian Entente as a form of
coercive hegemony [At the end of the Chinese Revolution in 1949, the PRC
and the Soviet Union became close allies.]{.underline} Chairman Mao
[Zedong and]{.underline} Premier Josef [Stalin formally instituted this
political, ideological, and military alliance by negotiating and signing
the Treaty of Moscow in 1950.]{.underline} At this juncture, the Soviet
Union was the senior partner whereas the newly established PRC was the
junior member of the alliance. China was still recovering from the
Japanese occupation and protracted civil war. A decade after the signing
of the Moscow Treaty, it became evident that political interests and
ideology were not sufficiently strong to keep these two actors together
in an alliance. Thus, from 1960 onward, the Sino-Soviet split became
increasingly evident and pronounced, even including a 7-month undeclared
military border conflict in 1969 that exacerbated further the
Sino-Soviet split. The tense rivalry and differences between these two
communist actors ultimately led to a de facto end to the alliance in
1979. At this point, China\'s tendency to side with the West and the
United States became more evident, too. It led to the official opening
of relations with the United States in the same year. Already several
years prior, in 1972, unofficial diplomatic ties under President Nixon
and Secretary of State Kissinger opened the door to China. Renewed
relations led to China\'s gradual embrace of the market economy. This
decision was fundamental in China\'s development and economic success
from the early 1980s to approximately 2014. [Interestingly, though,
**China has grown closer to Russia more recently**.]{.underline} 11 We
identify two interconnected examples to highlight and underscore better
the recent Chinese and Russian connection: [First, it is China\'s tacit
support for Russia\'s annexation of Crimean, and, second, the treaty on
energy cooperation negotiated and signed by China and Russia
concomitantly to the annexation of Crimea and the escalation of the
Eastern Ukraine war in 2014. First, China\'s reaction to the Russian
annexation of Crimea was mute (]{.underline}Ministry of Foreign Affairs
of the People\'s Republic of China, 2014). We must emphasise that
[before 2005, the PRC would have severely condemned and sternly opposed
Russia]{.underline}. Russian annexation of Crimea was anathema to
China\'s fundamental principles and priorities (Sun, 2015). [On the one
hand, it was a violation of sovereignty and the noninterference in the
internal affairs of another country]{.underline}. On the other hand, the
[annexation challenged China directly on two additional fronts: First,
its zealous commitment to defend its territory against aggression and,
second, its commitment to protect minorities within Chinese borders.
Notwithstanding, **China remained uncharacteristically distant and
quiet.** Second, the media outlets reported the energy treaty with
Russia as the deepening of the Sino-Russian relationship amid the
Eastern Ukrainian crisis and Western sanctions against
Russia]{.underline}. It was also a Russian carrot extended to China for
its allegiance, tacit political support of the Crimea annexation, and
the significant Chinese financial package. [This agreement was crucial
for Russian prowess at a juncture when it was simultaneously fighting an
undeclared war in Eastern Ukraine and escalating its military
involvement in the Syrian civil war to protect the government of its
political ally, President Bashar al-Assad]{.underline}. In exchange for
its advanced hefty financial package, Russia agreed to sell oil and
natural gas at rates considerably lower than current market prices. 12
It is plausible to argue here that the PRC agreed to the terms of the
2014 energy agreement on two grounds. First, the economic benefits
accruing to China were too vast and attractive to ignore. Second, the
agreement granted the PRC the first opportunity and greatest
satisfaction to become the senior partner in the Sino-Russian alliance
since the signing of the Treaty of Moscow in 1950, when the Soviet Union
was the senior partner. [The trend in China\'s international relations
examined thus far would suggest a **Chinese move toward revisionism,
aggressiveness, and coerciveness** insofar as the PRC condoned Russia\'s
annexation of the Crimean Peninsula]{.underline}. Besides, [China and
Russia appear to **share their opposition against united actions** by
the West\'s politico-military alliance.]{.underline} The Sino-Russian
universal resistance against the West seems to be supported by evidence
from the West\'s sanctions against Russia in the aftermath of the
Eastern Ukrainian crisis. Chi[na\'s reaction suggests that it is
preparing the grounds in case of future challenges to its rise by the
West]{.underline}. It appears as if [China is signalling to the West and
the entire world that it is prepared to defend its place among great
powers, **even if it entails the use of force and mass
violence**]{.underline}. Such actions are consistent with the violent
ascent of rising great powers in the history of the world such as
Wilhelmine Germany and Imperial Japan. From this vantage point, the
previous analysis suggests that [China is on track to follow the
footsteps of those other yesteryear revisionists and coercive rising
hegemons.]{.underline}

This article attempted to decipher and explain China\'s rise and its
future direction as a significant leader in the international system.
First, consistent with the benevolent-hegemon type, we observed how
China\'s active involvement in the management of the global environment
and the UN PKMs indicate this possibility. Nonetheless, these are mainly
political activities rather than economic. [The [benevolent-hegemon

reciprocity.]{.underline} To be sure, China is a hugely wealthy actor,
but one that practices a type of neomercantilist approach in the

**China can't fight -- imperial overstretch**

**Blumenthal, 17** - Daniel Blumenthal is director of Asian Studies at
the American Enterprise Institute ("A Strategy for China's Imperial
Overstretch" The American Interest, 3/1,

<http://www.the-american-interest.com/2017/03/01/a-strategy-for-chinas-imperial-overstretch/>

Notwithstanding the facile talk of China's "gains" from Donald Trump's
imagined withdrawal from the world, [Beijing is]{.underline} no position
to lead the world. Instead it is **[very close to imperial
overstretch]{.underline}**. A new U.S. strategic approach should hasten
a Chinese reckoning with its geopolitical troubles.

Contrary to the recent, post-Davos "wisdom" about a new era of Chinese
global leadership, things do not look good for Beijing. [The Chinese
economy continues to struggle]{.underline} and Chinese Communist Party
(CCP) Secretary-General Xi Jinping believes that China faces a
deteriorating security environment. Even so, [China continues to expand
its grandiose foreign policy ambitions, slowly extending its control
over the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea [while
also planning to create a "New Silk Road" linking Asia with Europe. But
China is biting off more than it can chew.]{.underline}

The CCP was founded on an anti-imperialist doctrine and is offended by
the suggestion that it rules an empire. Nevertheless, it does. Indeed,
China is the world's last standing multi-ethnic empire. Its physical
borders today mirror those of China's last imperial dynasty, the Qing
Dynasty, whose emperors conducted the greatest imperial expansion in
China's history. From the 17th to 19th centuries, they succeeded in
conquering Xinjiang, Tibet, Mongolia, and Taiwan. By virtue of these
achievements, the Qing expanded the empire to a truly continental scale.

With the exception of Mongolia and Taiwan, all of the Qing's imperial
conquests, including Xinjiang and Tibet, are again under Chinese control
today. And Beijing has regained de facto suzerainty over Hong Kong as it
exerts close to total control over the city-state's politics.

Finally, the international community long ago accepted the CCP's
position that Taiwan is part of China, never mind that this "claim" is
mostly based on the Qing imperial conquest of the island more than a
century ago. Beijing's continued hold over its empire is unique in
global affairs. For some context, imagine if Turkey still controlled the
Ottoman lands of the Levant and the Middle East. Or for another
comparative image, what if the Austo-Hungarian empire still controlled
much of Europe?

Today the CCP's desire for more territory does not stop with the old
Qing maps. Though the Qing Empire was not a maritime power, the CCP has
"discovered" new imperial territories in its surrounding seas. Chinese
commentators frequently refer to China's "three million square
kilometers of blue territory," which would incorporate "nearly 90% of
the area within the major bodies of water within the First Island Chain,
including the Bo Hai, the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and the South
China Sea."

China has claimed everything within the "nine-dash line" as its
"indisputable territory"---this arbitrary series of dashes on Chinese
maps encompasses the South China Sea. To advance this claim, Beijing has
built over 3,000 acres of new "island" bases and deployed military
forces to help control the surrounding waters. It has set up a
provincial administration to govern these maritime "territories," which
directs its fleets of maritime militias and law enforcement agencies to
harass foreign vessels.

All told, China's territorial claims now extend from the westernmost
reaches of Xinjiang, bordering Afghanistan, to the easternmost point in
the East China Sea. The sheer expanse of Beijing's claims might explain
why Xi is so pessimistic about China's security. The PLA must defend an
overwhelming amount of land and maritime territory from "enemies"
foreign and domestic.

Nonetheless, [Xi]{.underline} Jinping [is pressing ahead
with]{.underline} a key component of his national development strategy,
called "One Belt One Road" ([OBOR]{.underline})---a network of economic
infrastructure projects linking China with more than sixty Central
Asian, Middle Eastern, and European countries. This plan is intended to
proceed along two distinct routes. First, the Silk Road Economic Belt,
consisting of rail routes and oil and natural gas pipelines, will
stretch overland from China, through Central Asia to Eastern Europe.

Second, the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, made up of a series of port
projects, will extend through the Indian Ocean and into the Suez Canal
to reach the Mediterranean Sea. The underlying promise of OBOR is that
Chinese infrastructure investment can link together China's maritime and
continental interests. [Xi wants this program to be his stamp on China's
future]{.underline}, just as Deng Xiaoping was known for the policy of
"reform and opening." In practice, [China will have even more territory
and assets to protect]{.underline}.

Where Are the Resources?

[Xi faces substantial economic headwinds as China enters a period of
long-term economic stagnation]{.underline}. After the 2008 financial
crisis, the Chinese government conducted one of the largest stimulus
plans in history, leading to overcapacity and debt. The PRC's national
debt is in excess of \$28 trillion. In a further sign of financial
deterioration, Beijing's foreign exchange reserves have fallen from \$4
trillion in mid-2014 to \$3 trillion at the end of 2016. China's GDP
growth rate has slowed to as little as half of what it once was during
the mid-2000s. Some believe that the statistics of recent years are
falsified, and that [the annual growth rate has been between 3 and 5
percent for at least three years]{.underline}. That still might seem
high for a Western country, but [for a China still under pressure to
create employment and social stability, it spells trouble
ahead]{.underline}.

In addition, China has a rapidly aging society as the result of decades
of the One-Child Policy. The Chinese workforce continues to shrink
annually and the expense of caring for hundreds of millions of elderly
Chinese is overwhelming. Beijing will spend vast sums of money cleaning
up its environment---remediating soil pollution alone could cost over
\$1 trillion. Even doing the minimum to address these social ills will
strain China's fiscal resources.

If Xi were to face a real cost-imposing strategic challenge from the
United States, it is hard to see how he could continue to devote the
necessary resources to all of his social and foreign policy aspirations.

The Costs of the Empire

In pursuit of his ambitious foreign policy strategy, Xi Jinping has
urged the Party to think of China as both a maritime and continental
power. The Chinese government has continued to devote resources both to
China's naval build-up and to its vast internal security enterprise. At
its current buildup rate, the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) could
have 430 major surface combatants and almost one hundred submarines by
2030. It is on the path to possessing the world's largest merchant
marine and coast guard fleet as well. While the defense budget growth is
slowing a bit, this past year the PLA still saw a budget increase of
nearly 8 percent.

To advance (or, from Beijing's perspective, protect) its maritime plans,
China has increased the tempo of its maritime exercises. For example, it
sent its first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, through the Miyako Strait
within Japan's southern island chain, in December 2016, going beyond the
first island chain to conduct drills in the Western Pacific. Its
maritime militias and coast guard fleets maintain a steady presence
around the Senkaku Islands. Chinese vessels continue to maintain a
presence around the Scarborough Shoal, which Beijing seized from Manila
in 2012. Meanwhile, PLA rocket forces continue to improve their lethal
precision strike capabilities, with over 1,000 SRBMs alone aimed across
the Taiwan Strait. The PLA's military build-up and increased "presence
missions" require substantial new budgetary outlays.

On China's mainland, 800,000 People's Armed Police (PAP) troops patrol
the streets of Chinese cities to crackdown on protests and prevent
violent uprisings, particularly in the western regions of Xinjiang and
Tibet. Within what is known as the "Han heartland," the CCP faces unrest
as well. In turn, Beijing has engaged in the harshest crackdown on
social and political activity since the massacre at Tiananmen Square.
Repression is expensive, as is running an empire.

Beijing's Continental Consolidation

The tenacious efforts by both the Republic of China and the PRC to
reacquire and consolidate the territory of the Qing Empire remains among
the least studied phenomena in China's strategic history. Instead, most
observers of China accept the official narrative of China's "century of
humiliation." While China was doubtless a victim of Western imperialism,
when it comes to imperialism, it has been no slouch itself.

All efforts by China, including [the OBOR plan]{.underline}, on the
Asian continent [are driven]{.underline} in part [by the need to pacify
its territorial periphery.]{.underline} A 2015 Chinese National
Development and Reform Commission report states:

We should make good use of Xinjiang's geographic advantages and its role
as a window of westward opening-up to deepen communication and
cooperation with Central, South and West Asian countries, make it a key
transportation, trade, logistics, culture, science and education center,
and a core area on the Silk Road Economic Belt.

There are doubtless many strategic and economic reasons for OBOR. Xi
wants to put his stamp on China's economic development strategy, rid his
economy of overcapacity, create new export markets, and attempt to
re-establish the centrality of the Middle Kingdom in world affairs. But
[the most pressing continental priority for Xi is to further integrate
Xinjiang into China proper and keep potential "separatists" at
bay]{.underline}.

This plan is all very expensive. If, according to Chinese estimates, all
OBOR infrastructure investment were realized, the bill would be \$6
trillion (not all paid by China, of course). The China Development Bank
already has stated that close to \$900 billion of projects are either
planned or underway. China will finance OBOR projects through
institutions such as the China Development Bank, the China Eximbank, the
Silk Road Fund, and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).

This all sounded plausible while Beijing enjoyed double-digit economic
growth for three decades. But now [China must make hard choices about
where to allocate its national security resources]{.underline}. Thus
far, the United States has not hastened that reckoning. But China's
current imperial overstretch provides Washington with an opportunity to
do so.

**No China rise impact -- numerous checks on aggression.**

CMR)

For all its ambition, [[China's]{.mark} strategic options are not
unlimited]{.underline}. Indeed, [its [foreign policy]{.mark} choices
are]{.underline} **[[severely constrained]{.underline}]{.mark}** both
[[by]{.mark} formidable [domestic problems]{.mark} and]{.underline} by
[unfavorable international factors]{.underline} that the United States
would be wise to consider when formulating its response to China's
increasing influence.

[Internally]{.underline}, [Beijing's leaders face]{.underline} an
interwoven array of [[daunting social, environmental, economic, and
political problems that]{.underline}]{.mark}, left unresolved, [[will
**limit the state's ability** to generate national
power]{.underline}]{.mark} and could even threaten the Communist Party's
monopolistic grip on political and societal control. A brief look at
five of these issues makes clear the severity of the situation.

[Economic Restructuring]{.underline}: Some 100,000 state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) account for about half of China's economic assets.
Despite 15 years of reform efforts, [only half of]{.underline} the [SOEs
have been corporatized]{.underline}, and their return on assets is not
significantly different from those of the traditional SOEs. Overall,
[SOE financial performance has deteriorated]{.underline} significantly
since 2008, becoming a major drag on economic growth. [This drag serves
as a source of **serious political opposition**]{.underline} [to
enterprise reform]{.underline}, thereby [limiting the national
leadership's effort to focus on strategic sectors such as aviation,
energy, and telecommunications]{.underline}.13

Nevertheless, the impetus for reform has not slackened over the past
year, as both state and local SOEs have been selling off non-strategic
assets in accordance with Party policy direction. [[Serious political
obstacles to economic reform remain]{.underline},]{.mark} however,
including the fact that, for all of their inherent inefficiencies, [SOEs
predictably provide jobs to workers, who, if unemployed]{.underline},
might [question]{.underline} both [Party wisdom and]{.underline} its
unchallenged [supremacy]{.underline}. At the same time, [labor costs are
rapidly rising]{.underline}. In 2013, for example, China's 269 million
migrant workers earned an average of \$410 per month, an increase of
nearly 14 percent from 2012 and almost twice the rate of the nation's
GDP.14 As a result, [Chinese firms are being forced to
change]{.underline} their [enterprise models and export
strategies]{.underline} as foreign companies choose lower-wage
alternatives to China.15

The three-decade transition from an agrarian to industrial-service
economy, which saw the transition of some 300 million people from rural
to urban areas, will continue over the next two decades, with another
350 million people---a number in excess of the entire U.S.
population---still to follow. [The economic impact of]{.underline} this
colossal [resettlement has been staggering]{.underline}. Chinese
investment in real estate, which was \$120 billion in 2003, grew to
\$980 billion in 2011.Chinese investment in real estate, which was \$120
billion in 2003, grew to \$980 billion in 2011. [The infrastructure
required]{.underline} to support this exploding urban population [is
massive]{.underline}.16

Adding to these difficulties, [[PRC debt loads have
exploded]{.mark}]{.underline} over the past decade. [Government
debt]{.underline} (a large percentage of which is higher-risk local
government debt) to GDP ratio [stood]{.underline} [at 53.5 percent in
2012, up from 32.5 percent in 2005]{.underline}.17 Of greater concern is
[the recent rapid rise of total debt]{.underline} (encompassing that
from the corporate, household, and financial sectors), which [increased
from 150 percent of GDP in 2009 to 250 percent in
2014]{.underline}.18 Included in these figures are loans to SOEs that
have poor repayment records, but that are often protected by political
patronage. Moreover, the recent and dramatic rise of China's shadow
banking industry has complicated the central government's efforts to
bring lending under control.19 

[Aging Population & Social Welfare Costs]{.underline}: The scope and
pace of aging in China's population pose other significant economic
problems for the Party. Over the next twenty years, [[the ratio of
workers to retirees]{.underline}]{.mark} (at the current retirement age
of sixty) [will decrease from five-to-one to two-to-one]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} dramatic demographic shift [is]{.underline} both
[exacerbated and made more urgent by the success of the "one child
policy]{.underline}" in place since 1979. [It will]{.underline} not only
**[[erode]{.underline}]{.mark}** the huge **[[economic
stimulus]{.underline}]{.mark}** and advantage of a young working
population, but [it will also come at a point in China's modernization
when it is more vulnerable to the "middle income
trap]{.underline}."[20Huge expenditures will be required to put into
place]{.underline} more comprehensive [national health care and pension
systems]{.underline} to help avoid that potential pitfall.

[[Unequal Income Distribution]{.underline}]{.mark}: [China's gap between
its rich and poor]{.underline}, measured by its Gini coefficient, has
widened greatly since its opening to the world in 1979. In 2012, the
head of China's National Bureau of Statistics, Ma Jiantang, pegged it at
0.47-0.49, which is slightly below that of the United States, but high
for a developing country.21 [The reasons for this growing gap in wealth
distribution are well understood: rapid urbanization on the backs of
migrant workers not offered basic social services]{.underline} (a
variant of America's own illegal immigrant phenomenon, except that those
affected are PRC citizens); [the disparity in wealth between the coastal
regions and China's interior provinces]{.underline}; the cumulative
impact of [quality education and health care disproportionally available
to the Party, government, and urban elite]{.underline}; and [widespread
corruption]{.underline} (discussed below). In 2013, the Third Plenum of
the 18th Chinese Communist Party Congress noted the pressing need to
attend to this problem, but failed to offer any concrete proposals for
doing so.22

Environmental Degradation and Food Safety: [China's economic miracle has
occurred in tandem with environmental catastrophe]{.underline}. [Air and
water quality]{.underline}, especially in China's major urban areas, [is
among the worst in the world]{.underline}. In 2012, China's Vice
Minister of Environmental Protection, Wu Xiaoqing, stated that 40
percent of the country's rivers and 55 percent of its groundwater were
unfit for drinking. Moreover, he noted that in rural China some 320
million people lack access to safe drinking water.23 The cost of such
economic externalities came to roughly \$230 billion in 2010, or about
3.5 percent of GDP.24 [The scale of investment needed to adequately
address known environmental threats is extraordinary]{.underline}. For
example, between 2011 and 2020, the government plans to spend \$850
billion in water-related projects alone.25 Food safety is also a major
issue and an increasingly politicized one. It was only in the face of
mounting public pressure that the Ministry of Environmental Protection
admitted (in 2014) that the acreage of soil contamination (from heavy
metals, pesticides, and other toxins) of China's farmlands had reached a
record high of 20 percent.

Political Decay: [Most worrisome to China's leaders is the danger of
losing their monopoly on political power]{.underline}. President Xi
(like his predecessors) routinely calls official corruption a cancer
that, if unattended, will destroy the Party. But by [insisting on
exclusive occupation]{.underline} [of China's commanding political
heights]{.underline}, [the Party]{.underline} itself [becomes more
vulnerable to dysfunction, corruption, and political decay]{.underline}
as the number of political, economic, and social contradictions
multiply. China witnessed approximately 180,000 protests in 2010.
Reflecting Party anxieties, the state spends large sums of money to
ensure "stability maintenance." As recently as 2013, China's
expenditures for internal security exceeded those for its armed
forces.As recently as 2013, China's expenditures for internal security
exceeded those for its armed forces.26

Perhaps the Party leaders' greatest dilemma is that, while they
understand the need to decentralize economic and resource allocation
decision-making, they seem driven to pursue further political
consolidation in hopes that political and economic power can somehow be
disentangled. As a result, the development of an independent economic
entrepreneurial spirit, the establishment of a more robust rule of law
system, and the growth of civil society are all significantly retarded
in China, even as pressure for change continues to mount.

International Constraints on China's Rise

[[PRC leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} also **[[face daunting obstacles in
the international arena]{.underline}]{.mark}**. These include factors
related to history and geopolitics, military potential, and ideological
appeal.

History and Geography: China shares land borders with 14 countries,
three of which it has fought limited wars with during the past fifty
years: Russia (as the Soviet Union), Vietnam, and India. [A major land
dispute with India remains unresolved]{.underline}, [while China's
historical influence in the Russian Far East]{.underline} dating back to
the Qing Dynasty [continues to cause unease in Moscow]{.underline}.
[China's]{.underline} expansive [maritime claims in the East and South
China Seas have]{.underline} not only [stimulated increasingly fractious
disputes]{.underline} with Japan, the Philippines, and Vietnam,
[but]{.underline} have [also led to disagreements]{.underline} with
North Korea, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei. Pursuit of
these claims has also excited responses in Washington because they
involve two American treaty allies and potentially undermine the
principle of freedom of navigation---a vital U.S. security interest.27

Indeed, even as Party leaders seek to restore the prestige and influence
of dynastic empires in centuries past, [China's neighbors show no desire
to return to a tributary political order]{.underline}. Moreover, [China
is not an ethnically monolithic state]{.underline}. Its populace
includes restive non-Han Muslim citizens in its northwest Xinjiang
Province who have ethnic kin in Central Asia, as well as a large and
culturally distinct Tibetan population in its southwest. Additionally,
the PRC lays claim to ade facto independent, [democratic
Taiwan]{.underline} that [evinces little desire to unify with the
mainland]{.underline}. Even the full assimilation of Hong Kong has
proven both politically and socially challenging, as demonstrated by the
continuing pro-democracy movement. [[The]{.mark} tightening and
[expansion of Chinese power is **consistently contested**]{.mark} both
within its borders and in its immediate neighborhoods]{.underline}.

Military Limitations: [Despite extensive modernization]{.underline} over
the past 25 years, [the People's Liberation Army still lacks extended
force projection or sustained blue water naval
capabilities]{.underline}. China's military can bring impressive power
to bear at particular points along its border and near coastal areas. It
can also impose increasing costs on U.S. forces operating near its
territory. However, [**[the PLA lags far behind U.S. armed
forces]{.mark}** in terms of aggregate Asia-Pacific regional, and
especially global, capabilities.]{.underline}

Moreover, [given the costly political, economic, and social
challenges]{.underline} that [China's leaders must address over the next
two decades]{.underline}, [it seems unlikely]{.underline} that the
[Chinese armed forces will continue to enjoy the double-digit annual
budget increases]{.underline} that [it has been provided since the
mid-1990s]{.underline}. In addition, problems with corruption, a lack of
leadership initiative thanks to an over-centralized command structure,
and the still unproven ability of the PRC research and development
establishment to produce equipment and systems that rival those of the
United States and its key allies all cast doubt on the PLA's ability to
become a world-class military power in the near- to mid-term.

[Absence of Allies and Partners]{.underline}: [A state's power is
measured by its own usable capabilities and those of its relevant allies
and partners]{.underline} in various contingencies.Competent allies
magnify a state's power, and here [China is at a **tremendous
disadvantage** when compared with the United States]{.underline}.
Competent allies magnify a state's power, and here China is at a
tremendous disadvantage when compared with the United States. [China has
only one treaty ally]{.underline}---[North Korea]{.underline}---[and is
sharply at odds even with that regime]{.underline}, [whose interests are
not always in line which those of the PRC]{.underline}. [The one
cooperative security organization it nominally leads]{.underline}, the
Shanghai Cooperative Organization (SCO), includes Russia, Kazakhstan,
Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, but [no one takes]{.underline}
it [seriously]{.underline} as a functional military alliance. More
important, [the current warming relations between Moscow and Beijing
**will likely cool** once Beijing intensifies its efforts to establish a
new China-dominated Silk Road through Central Asia]{.underline}, a move
the Kremlin views as Chinese encroachment on a traditionally Russian
sphere of influence. Meanwhile, after losing its sway over its former
quasi-ally Myanmar, China's most reliable source of influence within
ASEAN is a struggling Cambodia. And to date, the PLA has yet to
establish any foreign military bases of consequence.

[The contrast with U.S. capabilities and assets could not be more
striking]{.underline}. In the Asia-Pacific region alone, America has
active military alliances with Japan, Korea, Australia, the Philippines,
and Thailand, and special relationships with Singapore, New Zealand, and
Taiwan. It has some 80,000 servicemen and servicewomen stationed
throughout the region. It also leads the 28-member NATO Alliance, the
most powerful military coalition in the world. [While China can
unilaterally apply concentrated pressure at specific locations on its
periphery, the United States can call upon a worldwide network of
friends and allies to flexibly deal with a wide variety of regional and
global security challenges.]{.underline}

[Weak Ideational Appeal]{.underline}: [China's]{.underline} global
economic power is significant but its [growth trajectory is
slowing]{.underline}. Even if Beijing can buy influence with its cash
reserves, its political model is not one that many states (never mind
Hong Kong and Taiwan) aspire to adopt, sharply limiting China's "soft
power" appeal. The United States ranks ahead of China around the world
(except in the Middle East) in favorability ratings, and significantly
so among those 18--29 years of age.28 The once and very temporarily
vaunted Beijing Consensus, a system that marries market mechanisms to
authoritarian political control, remains a mirage. The Communist Party
might yet develop a form of governance that is universally attractive,
but for now, China finds itself at a distinct disadvantage in the battle
of political ideas.

**No escalation or draw-in**

**Taylor, 14** \-- Head of the Strategic and Defense Studies Center --
Australian National University (Spring, Brendan, "The South China Sea is
Not a Flashpoint",

**[History]{.underline}** initially **[suggests]{.underline}** that
**[the [S]{.mark}]{.underline}**outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea **[is [not a
flashpoint]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The [loss of life resulting
from]{.underline} the [use of force there pales in comparison
to]{.underline} those in [East Asia's traditional
flashpoints]{.underline}. For instance, in the unresolved Korean War
(1950--53), which remains at the heart of continuing tensions on the
Korean Peninsula, an estimated two million military personnel were
either killed or unaccounted for.7 A comparable number of casualties
occurred in the Chinese Civil War (1946--1949), which left today's
Taiwan flashpoint as a direct product.8 Further, at a time when some
analysts are talking up the prospects of war between China and Japan
over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, it is worth recalling that an estimated
15--35 million perished during the course of the second Sino--Japanese
War (1937--45).9

While history is not destiny, more recent estimates suggest that the
combustion of any one of these flashpoints today could prove equally
devastating. Richard Bush and Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings
Institution, for example, predict that a conflict over Taiwan could
spark a nuclear war involving 1.5 billion people and produce a
fundamental change in the international order.10 Similar estimates
produced at the time of the 1993--94 North Korean nuclear crisis
suggested that war on the Korean Peninsula could cost half a million
lives and up to US\$1 trillion in its first ninety days.11 Conflict
between Asia's two most powerful navies in the East China Sea could
prove equally devastating, particularly given that China and Japan are
also the world's second- and third-largest economies, respectively.
Total trade between these two historical great powers of East Asia
currently stands at U.S. \$345 billion.12

[[It is **hard to envisage a credible scenario** where a
skirmish]{.mark} in the **S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina
**[S]{.underline}**ea [[could erupt]{.mark} into a conflict of similar
proportions]{.underline}. [The [nationalist foundations of these
disputes are **fundamentally different**]{.mark} from those underpinning
East Asia's traditional flashpoints]{.underline}. By way of example,
recent polling suggests that 87 percent of the Chinese public view Japan
negatively, whilst 50 percent anticipate a military dispute with
Japan.13 Reflecting this sentiment, when Tokyo announced its decision to
purchase contested Islands in the East China Sea from their private
owner in September 2012, this sparked widespread anti-Japanese protests
across China that spread to more than 100 cities.14 Such [public
displays of nationalist sentiment stand in marked contrast to June 2013
anti-China protests in Hanoi following]{.underline} Vietnamese
[allegations that a Chinese vessel had rammed and damaged a Vietnamese
fishing boat]{.underline}. Subsequently, [a **mere 150 protesters**
gathered in the city center]{.underline}.15 [Crowds of comparable size
have attended anti-Chinese protests in the Philippines]{.underline}. For
instance, a March 2012 protest outside the Chinese Embassy in Manila
that organizers expected to draw 1,000 protesters attracted barely half
that number.16

The [[strategic geography]{.underline}]{.mark} of the South China Sea
[[also **militates against it being a genuine
flashpoint**]{.underline}.]{.mark} [Throughout history, [large bodies of
water have tended to inhibit]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[**[willingness]{.mark}** and **ability** of adversaries to wage
war]{.underline}. In The Tragedy of Great Power Politics, for instance,
John Mearsheimer refers to "the stopping power of water," writing of the
limits that large bodies of water place on the capacity of states to
project military power---relative, at least, to when they share common
land borders.17 [Even when clashes]{.underline} at sea [do
occur]{.underline}, [history suggests]{.underline} that [these generally
afford statesmen **[greater time and space to find diplomatic
solution]{.mark}s**]{.underline}. As Robert Ross observes, in such cases
"[neither side has to fear that]{.underline} the other's [provocative
diplomacy or movement of troops is a prelude to attack]{.underline} and
immediately escalate to heightened military readiness. [[Tension can be
**slower to develop**]{.mark}, allowing]{.underline} the protagonists
[time to **manage** and **avoid** unnecessary
escalation]{.underline}."18

[Ross' observation]{.underline}, in turn, [dovetails]{.underline}
elegantly [with the issue of proximity]{.underline}, which Hoyt regards
as a defining feature of a flashpoint. [The antagonists in the
**S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea
disputes [are **less proximate**]{.underline} than in the case of the
Korean Peninsula---where the two Koreas share a land border that remains
the most militarized on earth. The same can be said of the Taiwan
flashpoint. Indeed, the proximity of Taiwan to the mainland affords
Beijing [credible strategic options]{.underline}--- [and]{.underline}
arguably even [incentives]{.underline}---[involving]{.underline} the
[use of force]{.underline} that [are **not available**]{.underline} to
it [in the **S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina
**[S]{.underline}**ea.19

Finally, and related to the third of Hoyt's criteria, [the
**S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea
**[cannot be said to engage the vital interests of Asia's great
powers]{.underline}**. To be sure, much has been made of India's growing
interests in this part of the world--- particularly following reports of
a July 2011 face-off between a Chinese ship and an Indian naval vessel
that was leaving Vietnamese waters.20 However, [New Delhi's
interests]{.underline} in the South China Sea [remain overwhelmingly
economic, not strategic, driven]{.underline} as they are by the search
for oil. Moreover, even if New Delhi had anything more than secondary
strategic interests at stake in the geographically distant South China
Sea, it is widely accepted that India's armed forces will for some time
lack the capacity to credibly defend these.21 Similarly, while much has
been made of Tokyo's willingness to assist Manila with improving its
maritime surveillance capabilities,22 for reasons of history and
geography, [Tokyo's interests in the Senkaku]{.underline}/Diaoyu
[Islands]{.underline} dispute, the [Korean Peninsula, and]{.underline}
even the [Taiwan]{.underline} flashpoint **[dwarf those]{.underline}**
which **[it has at stake in the]{.underline}** more **[distant
S]{.underline}**outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea. [The
extent to which this body of water]{.underline} genuinely
[engages]{.underline} the [vital interests of China and the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[continues to be
overstated]{.underline}**.

As Japan and China recognize the altered dynamics around the Pacific
Rim, some observers believe that they may inch toward a possible
reconciliation. Such a [Sino-Japanese]{.underline} **[rapprochement is
unlikely]{.underline}**, however, [given their]{.underline}
**[long-standing historical enmity.]{.underline}** [Negative
attitudes]{.underline} **[toward Japan]{.underline}** [are]{.underline}
**[widespread among main- land Chinese]{.underline}**. According to a
recent Pew survey, [less than **10% of Chinese** think that
Japan]{.underline} **[can be trusted]{.underline}**---[and the feeling
is]{.underline} **[mutual]{.underline}**. [Young Chinese]{.underline},
who did not personally experience the war, [express]{.underline}
**[surprisingly vehement anti-Japanese
feelings]{.underline}**---[sentiments that are due in no small part to
state propaganda and patri- otic education]{.underline} in schools that
**[make criticism of Japan politically correct]{.underline}**.92
Moreover, the [Chinese see themselves as the **natural
hegemon**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} in their--- worldview, **[the
Japanese should be subordinate to them]{.underline}**---in other words,
[Chinese elites]{.underline} **[refuse to accept Japan's legitimacy as a
major Asian state.]{.underline}** [Neither]{.underline} Shinzo [Abe nor
his successors will]{.underline} **[tolerate such a future for
Japan,]{.underline}** which is why Japan is offering maritime and
development assistance to countries like Vietnam and the Philippines.
Ultimately, however, China's rise and America's retreat to a more
offshore posture will force into existence a military alliance between
Japan and India (and, perhaps, Russia as well) to restore a regional
balance of power to counter growing Chinese power.
